<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for dyeing textile articles in which the articles are confined in bulk but in orderly fashion in a dyebath up to a level therein, the dyebath is loaded with dye liquor to cover the articles and the liquor is circulated through forceful sprays directed towards the articles from above said level.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dyeing textile articles and in particular, though not 
necessarily exclusively, to the dyeing of hosiery such as ladies' stockings and tights. There are many ways of dyeing textile articles and many different types of 
dyeing machinery. The problem is always to find an economical method which can be 
carried out on machinery of low capital cost and maintenance requirements which is, 
however, effective to produce uniform dyeing both from article to article and as between 
different parts of the same article. The invention provides a method which is particularly satisfactory, at least 
for the dyeing of ladies hosiery, in all of these regards and machinery for carrying out the 
method.  
 
Patent application FR-A-2388071 which represents the closest prior art, discloses a machine for dyeing and drying stockings 
and other articles of clothing, comprising a receiver containing a 
plurality of horizontal perforated diaphragms on which the articles rest, the diaphragms 
having a modicum of manoeuvrability to permit the loading and unloading of articles, and a 
vertical central tubular element which passes through the diaphragms and contains a driven 
propeller to circulate liquids, together with means for loading and unloading liquids, means for 
heating the fluids, and means for introducing and exhausting drying air. However, this suffers from insufficient 
circulation and penetration of the articles by the dye. US-A-2985502 discloses dyeing methods using limited quantities of heated dye, 
the dye being heated by a counterflow of steam as it exits spray nozzles at a predetermined rate. This method also suffers from the problem of limited circulation and penetration, the 
sprays merely being used to provide a convenient way to heat the dye, rather than increase the 
penetration of the dye into the articles to be dyed. In order to overcome the abovementioned problems 
the present invention comprises a method for dyeing textile articles in a dyebath 
with circulating means for circulating liquids, which method is characterized in that said articles are 
confined in bulk but in orderly fashion in the dyebath up to a level therein, loading the 
dyebath with dye liquor to cover the articles and circulating said liquor through forceful 
sprays directed towards the articles from above said level, whereby a 
rapid penetration of dye liquor as a result of 
the kinetic energy of the dye liquor emerging from 
the sprays is obtained.  
 Pretreatment of the articles, including scouring and the

A method for dyeing textile articles (13) in a dyebath (11) with circulating means 
(19) for circulating liquids, characterised in that said articles (13) are confined in bulk but in 

orderly fashion in the dyebath (11) up to a level (12) therein, loading the dyebath (11) with dye 
liquor (14) to cover the articles (13) and circulating said liquor (14) through forceful sprays (15) 

directed towards the articles (13) from above said level (12), whereby a rapid 
penetration of dye liquor as a result of the kinetic energy 

of the dye liquor emerging from the sprays is obtained. 
A method according to claim 1, in which the articles (13) are pre-treated, as by 
scouring and/or the application of dyeing assistants such as levellers and retarders, in the 

dyebath (11) with liquid circulated through said sprays (15). 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, in which the articles (13) are packed 
in readily penetrable bags and a plurality of such bags packed in the dyebath (11). 
A method according to claim 3, in which the articles (13) are hosiery articles such 
as stockings and tights and are packed flat in the bags. 
Apparatus for dyeing textile articles (13) comprising a dyebath (11) and 
circulating means (19) for circulating liquids, characterised in that the dyebath (11) is loadable 

up to a level (12) with articles (13) to be dyed and that the circulating means (19) for circulating 
dye liquor (14) through the dyebath (11) include forceful sprays (15) located  

 
above said level (12) and directed downwardly at articles (13) confined in the dyebath (11). 
Apparatus according to claim 5, comprising an open topped container (16) and 
a removable insert, the insert comprising a carrier (17) for carrying the articles (13) to be dyed 

in bulk but orderly fashion and having a column (18) from which extends, above said level, an 
array of perforated tubes constituting said sprays (15) and connected 
via
 said column (18) to 
forced circulation means (19) for the container (16). 
Apparatus according to claim 6, comprising a removable lid (23) for the container 
(16). 
Apparatus according to claim 7, in which the lid (23) is carried on the removable 
carrier (17). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 6 to 8, in which the container (16) is 
rectangular in plan. 
Apparatus according to claim 9, in which the column (18) extends along the 
container (16). 
Apparatus according to claim 10, in which the column (18) extends along the 
container (16) in a central position so that the array of sprays (15) extends either side of the 

column (18).  
 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 6 to 11, in which the carrier (17) 
comprises a framework adapted to confine a charge of articles (13) to be dyed so that the articles 

(13) can be loaded into the framework with the carrier (17) removed from the container (16) and 
the loaded carrier (17) then lowered into the open topped container (16). 
Apparatus according to claim 12, comprising a second carrier (17) which can be 
charged whilst the first is in use for dyeing.
