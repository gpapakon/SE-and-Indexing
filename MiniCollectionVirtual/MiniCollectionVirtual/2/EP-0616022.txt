<ABSTRACT>
In a process for the pressure gasification of fine particulate fuels, a gasification reactor, a quench pipe and a convection boiler are concentrically arranged in a pressure vessel designed for the pressure of the pressure gasification. The crude gas axially leaving the gasification reactor at the top is introduced into the quench pipe connected to the top. A quenching gas is introduced. The mixed gas stream of crude gas and quenching gas is deflected by 180@ by means of a deflection screen which is rotationally symmetrical relative to the axis of the quench pipe and transformed into a hollow-cylindrical gas stream. The hollow-cylindrical gas stream is introduced into the convection boiler which is of hollow-cylindrical shape and concentrically surrounds the quench pipe. On leaving the convection boiler, the crude gas stream is extracted out of the convection boiler by means of a crude gas extraction device. The flow velocity of the crude gas is adjusted such that particles of slag and ash entrained by the crude gas are carried via the 180@ deflection into the hollow-cylindrical convection boiler. The flow velocity in the crude gas extraction device is adjusted such that the entrained particles of slag and ash are discharged.

A process for the pressure gasification of 
finely divided fuels, comprising the following process steps: 


a) a gasification reactor, a quench tube and a 
convection vessel are concentrically disposed in a 

pressure vessel which is designed for the pressure 
of the pressure gasification, 
b) the crude gas emerging axially upwards from the 
gasification reactor is introduced into the 

upwardly adjoining quench tube, which is surrounded 
by the convection vessel, 
c) quench gas is supplied, 
d) the mixed gas stream comprising crude gas and 
quench gas (hereinafter again called crude gas) is 

deflected by 180° above the quench tube by a 
deflection screen which is rotationally symmetrical 

with respect to the quench tube and is transformed 
into a hollow cylindrical gas stream, 
e) the hollow, cylindrical gas stream is introduced 
into the convection vessel of hollow cylindrical 

construction which concentrically surrounds the  

 
quench tube, 
f) on its emergence from the convection vessel the 
crude gas stream is drawn out of the convection 

vessel with the aid of a crude gas take-off device, 
 
wherein the velocity of flow of the crude gas is arranged so 

that slag and ash components entrained by the crude gas are 
carried beyond the 180° deflection into the hollow cylindrical 

convection vessel, in which they undergo cooling until they 
lose their adhesiveness, and wherein the velocity of flow in 

the crude gas take-off device is arranged so that the 
entrained slag and ash particles are removed. 
A process according to claim 1, wherein the 
deflected crude gas stream is led past concentric convective 

heat-exchange surfaces in the convection vessel and is cooled 
to a temperature of 200 to 400°C on entry into the crude gas 

take-off device. 
A process according to either one of claims 1 or 
2, wherein the quench gas is introduced into the quench tube 

uniformly distributed over the entire periphery and in cross-flow 
to the crude gas by means of an encircling quench gas 

feed gap between the gasification reactor and the quench tube. 
A process according to claim 3, wherein the 
quench gas is introduced into the quench tube via a quench gas 

feed gap which is free from built-in components. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4,  
 

wherein a swirl flow is impressed on the crude gas stream in 
the crude gas take-off device on its emergence from the 

convection vessel, and the velocity of flow as well as the 
swirl in the crude gas take-off device are arranged so that 

entrained slag and ash particles are removed.
