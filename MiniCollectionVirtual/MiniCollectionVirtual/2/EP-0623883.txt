<ABSTRACT>
An image access document for use in an image 
presentation system is provided in which the document 

comprises a supportive substrate containing machine 
readable information (18) and human readable information 

(12, 14). The human readable information may be 
representative of an image stored in a separate storage 

device and the machine readable information is associated 
with a reference number to be correlated with a look-up 

table for determining a storage address in the storage 
device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image access 
document for use in an image presentation system. In many fields of endeavor, images are stored for 
later access and examination. For example, X-ray 
photographs and other images are stored for later study by 
medical personnel. Similarly, engineering drawings may be 
stored for later recall. In each of these applications, as 
is true in many others, the stored images must be able to 
be randomly accessed in order to be effectively used. One 
method of storing such images and allowing random access is 
to simply store copies of the images on paper or another 
suitable medium. As the number of such images or documents 
stored becomes large, however, the space required to so 
store the images can become great. Furthermore the 
problems associated with locating a particular image can 
also be difficult. An alternative to storing the actual images or 
documents is the storing of electronic representations of 
those images from which a computer can electronically 
reconstruct the image and display it on a suitable device. 
Typically such systems allow random access to documents by 
recalling a selected document when a reference number or 
name associated with that document is typed on a keyboard 
or keypad. An inherent disadvantage of such a system lies 
in the fact that the reference numbers or names must be 
recorded and recalled and correctly entered in order to 
access selected documents. A field where easy access to documents is  
 
important is that of using images in presentations. 
Studies have indicated that the use of visual aids, such as 
transparencies displayed by an overhead projector, can 
greatly increase the effectiveness of speakers. The 
effectiveness of a presentation is, however, greatly 
reduced, or even eliminated, if the speaker must search for 
a particular transparency. Even when the transparencies 
are properly ordered at the beginning of a speech, audience 
interaction or other factors may require the speaker to 
depart from the prepared outline, inducing such searching. The use of computer-generated images which may be 
directly projected by a large screen television or produced 
on a display such as a liquid crystal display and projected 
by a conventional overhead projector helps to alleviate 
problems associated with such searching. A problem that 
does exist with such systems, however, relates to the way 
images are accessed. Typically such computerized image 
display systems permit display of images either in a 
pre-set
