<ABSTRACT>
The use of polyester-polyols having a hydroxyl number in the range from 80 to 250 based on a) specific polyol mixtures and b) aliphatic, unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, and optionally aliphatic, saturated dicarboxylic acids as binder component for two-component polyurethane paints (surface coatings, lacquers, enamels, varnishes), in particular for the production of paint films on plastic mouldings as used in automobile production.

<CLAIMS>
Use of polyester polyols of the hydroxyl value range
from 80 to 250 which are reaction products of


a) 52 to 60 mol.% of a polyol component with
b) 48 to 40 mol.% of a dicarboxylic acid component,

optionally blended with other organic polyhydroxyl
compounds as a binder component for two-component

polyurethane lacquers, which contain lacquer
polyisocyanates optionally together with the auxiliary

substances and additives conventional in lacquer
technology, in the production of lacquer coatings on

plastic mouldings, characterised in that

a) the polyol component consists of (i) 5 to
50 mol.% of a dihydric, aliphatic alcohol

containing at least two carbon atoms, other than
neopentyl glycol, or a mixture of two or more

such alcohols, (ii) 5 to 40 mol.% of an at least
trihydric, aliphatic alcohol containing at least

3 carbon atoms or a mixture of two or more such
alcohols, (iii) 0 to 9 mol.% of diols containing

cycloaliphatic units and (iv) 20 to 90 mol.% of
neopentyl glycol, and
b) the dicarboxylic acid component consists of (v) 0
to 49.9 wt.% of an aliphatic, saturated

dicarboxylic acid or an anhydride of such an acid
containing at least 2 carbon atoms or a mixture

of two or more such acids or anhydrides and (vi)
50.1 to 100 mol.% of an aliphatic, unsaturated

dicarboxylic acid or the anhydride thereof
containing at least 4 carbon atoms or mixtures of

such acids or anhydrides,
 
wherein the percentages stated in a) and b) in each

case add up to 100.
Use according to claim 1 for the production of lacquer
coatings on plastic mouldings as are used in

automotive construction.
Use according to claims 1 and 2 for the production of
lacquer coatings on structures produced using

composite methods from metals and flexible plastics,
as are used in automotive construction.
