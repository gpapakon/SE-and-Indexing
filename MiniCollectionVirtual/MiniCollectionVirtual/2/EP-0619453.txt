<ABSTRACT>
A mechanism for arresting the motion of spheres (2) 
travelling in a pipeline (1) comprises a sphere-engaging 

member (10) extending in the pipeline into the path of 
spheres and rigidly attached to a shaft (13) rotatable in a 

pressure-retaining housing (18) attached to the pipeline, a 
first lever (22) fixedly attached to the shaft outside the 

pressure-retaining housing, a second lever (21) rotatably 
mounted on the shaft adjacent to the first lever, a stop 

member (41) adapted to limit the movement of the second 
lever, and a pin (31) extending between and joining the 

first and second levers, the pin being adapted to shear upon 
the application to the sphere-engaging member of a pre-determined 

force.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the pigging of pipelines, 
and is especially concerned with a mechanism which assists 
in the arresting of pigs at the end of their journey through 
the pipeline. As is well known, the pigging of pipelines is carried 
out for various reasons, the most usual of which is for the 
purpose of cleaning the interior walls. Various designs and 
shapes of pig are commonly available, one form being the 
sphere, usually made of rubberised or vulcanised material, 
which is passed along the pipeline under the pressure of the 
gas or liquid which flows in the pipeline. The sphere-shaped 
pig is so sized as to come into contact with any 
foreign objects attached to the internal wall of the 
pipeline, and remove them. The pipeline is usually under 
pressure, and that, the size and speed of the sphere within 
the pipeline means that as it reaches the end of its travel, 
the sphere has considerable momentum. If it were not 
arrested before it reached the end of the pipeline, severe 
damage could be done to the pipeline closure. Thus, the sphere, towards the end of its travel in the 
pipeline, is usually collected in a receiving trap, which 
decelerates it before it reaches the end of its travel. 
Such decelerating means may take the form of one or more 
flaps extending into the pipeline at right angles to its 
axis, such flaps being pivoted about an axis in or beyond 
the pipeline wall. Thus, as the fast-travelling spheres 
contact the flaps, the flaps pivot about their pivot axis 
and serve to decelerate the sphere by "wedging" the sphere 
between each flap and the bottom of the pipeline. Specification 
GB-A-2102095 describes a similar sphere decelerating mechanism. It sometimes happens that more than one sphere is 
passing along the pipeline at a time, or a single sphere is 
travelling too fast, so that contact of a sphere with an 
arresting flap has the effect of pivoting the flap so  
 
severely that the pivoting mechanism is broken. It must 
therefore be replaced or repaired, and re-set before further 
pigging can take place. It is the object of the present invention to provide 
a mechanism for arresting the motion of spheres travelling 
in a pipeline, whereby any excess force applied by the fast-travelling 
sphere to the sphere-arresting member does not 
result in the breakage of the mechanism mounting the 
arresting member. According to the invention, a mechanism for arresting 
the motion of spheres travelling in a pipeline comprises a 
sphere-engaging member extending in the pipeline

<CLAIMS>
A mechanism for arresting the motion of spheres (2) 

travelling in a pipeline (1) comprising a sphere-engaging member (10) 
extending in the pipeline into the path of spheres, characterised in said sphere-engaging 

member being rigidly attached to a shaft (13) rotatable in a pressure-retaining 
housing (18) attached to the pipeline, a first lever (22) 

fixedly attached to the shaft outside the pressure-retaining 
housing, a second lever (21) rotatably mounted on the shaft 

adjacent to the first lever, a stop member (41) adapted to limit 
the movement of the second lever, and a pin (31) extending 

between and joining the first and second levers, the pin (31) 
being adapted to shear upon the application to the sphere-engaging 

member of a pre-determined force. 
A mechanism according to claim 1 wherein the stop 
member (41) is in the form of a cam (41, 42) mounted on the pipeline and 

the second lever (21) carries a cam follower (30, 130) which engages the 
cam to stop the movement of the second lever and re-arrange 

the position of the second lever relative to the shaft. 
A mechanism according to claim 1 or 2 comprising two 
sphere-engaging members (10) which extend into the pipeline and 

are longitudinally spaced along the pipeline a sufficient 
distance apart to allow each to be moved independently 

without interfering with a sphere engaged by the other, each 
of the two sphere-engaging members being rigidly attached to 

a shaft (13) rotatable in a respective pressure-retaining housing 
attached to the pipeline, first and second levers (22, 21) being 

associated with each shaft, and a stop member (41, 42) being 
associated with each second lever. 
A mechanism according to claim 3 wherein said stop 
member is in the form of a plate (40) carrying a cam (41, 42) adapted to 

receive a cam follower carried by each of the second levers. 
A mechanism according to any of claims 1 to 4 wherein 
means are mounted on the pipeline for effecting the movement 

of the stop member. 
A mechanism according to any of claims 1 to 5 wherein 
the or each sphere-engaging member is in the form of a flap (10) 

extending into the pipeline at an oblique angle to its axis. 
A mechanism according to claim 6 wherein each flap (10) is  
 

in the form of a section of a frusto-cone, having a 
curvature similar to that of the sphere which it engages. 
A mechanism according to claim 6 or 7 wherein the or 
each flap (10) is welded to a boss (11) which, at its end remote from 

the flap is fixedly attached to the respective rotating 
shaft (13).
