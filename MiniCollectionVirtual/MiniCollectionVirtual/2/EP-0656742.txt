<ABSTRACT>
A screening device for screening gaps 11 in walls or housings against radio-frequency waves or pulses has at least one screening arrangement 60, 61 which extends along the gap 11 and has a retaining groove 47, 48 on a first gap side, into which retaining groove 47, 48 an electrically conductive screening strip 60, 61 is inserted by means of a foot section 62, 63 which grips behind an undercut 50, 52 in the retaining groove 47, 48, the screening strip 60, 61 resting against the opposite gap in an elastically prestressed manner. In order that the screening device can easily be inserted and withdrawn again, at least one removable locking pin 66, 67 in order to lock the foot section 62, 63 in the retaining groove 47, 48 in a positively locking manner, is provided on that side of the retaining groove 47, 48 which is opposite the undercut 50, 52, the screening strip 60, 61 being removable from the retaining groove 47, 48 once the locking pin 60, 67 or the locking pins have been removed.

Sealing device for sealing gaps (11) in walls of 
housings against radio-frequency waves or pulses, having 

at least one sealing arrangement (60, 61) which extends 
along the gap (11) and has a receiving groove (47, 48) on 

a first gap side, into which there is inserted an electrically 
conductive sealing strip (60, 61) having a foot 

section (62, 63) which grips behind an undercut (50, 52) 
in the receiving groove (47, 48), the sealing strip (60, 

61) bearing against the opposite gap side under elastic 
prestressing, characterized in that at least one 

removable blocking pin (66, 67) is provided on that side 
of the receiving groove (47, 48) which is opposite the 

undercut (50, 52) for the purpose of positively blocking 
the foot section (62, 63) in the receiving groove 

(47, 48), it being possible to extract the sealing strip 
(60, 61) from the receiving groove (47, 48) after removal 

of the blocking pin (66, 67) or of the blocking pins. 
Sealing device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the receiving groove (47, 48) has a 

second undercut (49, 51) which is opposite the first and 
grips behind the foot section (62, 63) and into which the 

blocking pin (66, 67) is inserted a position such that 
the transverse movability of the sealing strip (60, 61) 

is limited in such a way that the foot section (62, 63) 
grips behind the two undercuts (49, 50, 51, 52). 
Sealing device according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the blocking pin (66, 67) or the blocking  

 
pins is or are designed and arranged in such a way that 

the foot section (62, 63) is held immovably in the 
transverse direction. 
Sealing device according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the blocking pin (66, 67) or the blocking 

pins is or are inserted in the base of the undercut. 
Sealing device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the blocking pin (66, 67) or the 

blocking pins is or are respectively designed as a round 
pin or as round pins. 
Sealing device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the sealing strip (60, 61) is
 
designed with a V-shaped cross-section, a first V limb 

(62, 63) forming the foot section and a second V limb 
(64, 65) projecting obliquely from the receiving groove 

(47, 48) and being resiliently movable. 
Sealing device according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the region of the connection of the 

V limbs (62, 63, 64, 65) grips behind the first undercut 
(50, 52). 
Sealing device according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized 
in that the free edge of the second V limb 

(64, 65) bears against the second gap side with linear 
contact. 
Sealing device according to one of Claims 6 to 8, 
characterized in that the sealing strip (60, 61) consists 

of spring steel. 
Sealing device according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that an additional seal is provided 

which has a receiving groove (38) on one gap side and a 
sealing profile (42) which is inserted therein, the 

sealing profile consisting of an elastic material and 
bearing against the other gap side under elastic 

prestressing. 
Sealing device according to Claim 10, characterized 
in that the sealing profile (42) has a double 

sealing lip (45, 46) for bearing against the other gap 
side. 
Sealing device according to Claim 10 or 11,  
 

characterized in that the additional seal (38, 42) is 
attached towards the outside of the housing. 
Sealing device according to one of Claims 1 to
