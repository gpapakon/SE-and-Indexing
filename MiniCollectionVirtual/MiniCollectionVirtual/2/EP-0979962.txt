<ABSTRACT>
A seal assembly (10) and a rotary machine (12), such as
a steam turbine, containing the seal assembly. A casing (16)

circumferentially surrounds a rotor and includes a circumferential
channel (20) open to the rotor. Seal segments (22) are

circumferentially arrayed in the channel and are movable between
radially inward and outward positions. Circumferentially adjacent seal

segments have circumferentially opposing surface grooves (34). A
resilient and imperforate member (40) is engaged in the grooves of

circumferentially-adjacent seal segments circumferentially urging apart
such segments and providing sealing between such segments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to rotary
machines, and more particularly to a seal assembly for a rotary
machine and to a rotary machine containing such seal assembly.Rotary machines include, without limitation, turbines for
steam turbines and compressors and turbines for gas turbines. A
steam turbine has a steam path which typically includes, in serial-flow
relationship, a steam inlet, a turbine, and a steam outlet. A gas turbine
has a gas path which typically includes, in serial-flow relationship, an air
intake (or inlet), a compressor, a combustor, a turbine, and a gas outlet
(or exhaust nozzle). Gas or steam leakage, either out of the gas or
steam path or into the gas or steam path, from an area of higher
pressure to an area of lower pressure, is generally undesirable. For
example, gas-path leakage in the turbine or compressor area of a gas
turbine, between the rotor of the turbine or compressor and the
circumferentially surrounding turbine or compressor casing, will lower
the efficiency of the gas turbine leading to increased fuel costs. Also,
steam-path leakage in the turbine area of a steam turbine, between the
rotor of the turbine and the circumferentially surrounding casing, will
lower the efficiency of the steam turbine leading to increased fuel costs.It is known to position variable-clearance labyrinth-seal
segments in a circumferential array between the rotor of the turbine and
the circumferentially surrounding casing to minimize steam-path
leakage. The ends of coil springs engage circumferentially-opposing
and generally-matching holes in circumferentially-adjacent seal 
segments. The coil springs circumferentially urge apart
circumferentially-adjacent seal segments. Such circumferentially-urging-apart
causes the seal segments to move radially outward within
a channel in the casing. This prevents damage to the labyrinth-seal
teeth from transient radial movement of the rotor during turbine startup.
As the rotor reaches steady-state operating conditions, steam pressure
builds up in the turbine, and such pressurized fluid enters the channel
and pushes the seal segments radially inward such that the labyrinth-seal
teeth are in close proximity to the rotor for more efficient healing.
Designs have been proposed which add brush-seal bristles to a
labyrinth seal segment.In a first preferred embodiment, the seal assembly of the
invention is for a rotary machine. The rotary machine includes a rotor
and a casing. The rotor has a generally longitudinally-extending axis.
The casing is generally
