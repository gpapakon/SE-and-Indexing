<ABSTRACT>
An electrophotographic apparatus (1) 
incorporating a sorter device formed by a double pair 

of driving rollers (12,18,15,19) for ejecting sheets 
from the apparatus and delivering them into a 

collecting bin (38), the two roller pairs acting on the 
side edges (21A,21B) of the sheets (21) at selectively 

controllable velocities to selectively produce an 
angular deflection of the outgoing sheets in either of 

two directions and their delivery into the collecting 
bin (38) in different positions rotated from each 

other, the bin (38) having an opening dihedral with 
side walls (35,36) which define the maximum amounts of 

imparted deflection for the two positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an 
electrophotographic apparatus incorporating a sorter 
device. It is well known that electrophotographic 
apparatus, more commonly referred to as copiers, are 
customarily equipped with a sorter device enabling a 
plurality of copies to be orderly laid into a plurality 
of collecting bins in stacked arrangements. Such sorter devices are bulky, expensive, and 
unsuitable for combination with compact 
electrophotographic equipment of the office type, 
usually intended for installation on a desk. Such compact equipment includes both copiers 
and printers, usually laser printers, employed as 
printout units for small data processing systems, 
working stations, and personal computers. A current trend with the latter favors shared 
use of one printing unit as a peripheral unit by a 
number of users, although this may be a limited number 
(2 or 3). Thus, there exists a need for splitting 
multiple copies of one printed document, as well as for 
keeping printed sheets of one user separated from 
another user's.  To that aim, electrophotographic apparatus 
have been introduced on the market which are equipped 
with a sorter device of a so-called job offset type 
having a single collecting bin adapted to be shifted 
perpendicularly to the printed sheet direction of 
delivery from the apparatus, through a travel distance 
of a few centimeters between two discrete end 
positions. Depending on the printing process selected by 
the user, the bin is shifted automatically to either 
position such that the printed sheets will gather at 
two discrete end locations in the bin by their process, 
hence their user, and can be readily separated even 
where the processes are interlaced and the printed 
sheets come interleaved. Such job offset devices, which may also be 
used for severing duplicates, are bulky and expensive 
because they require a mechanical drive and a suitable 
holding frame for the bin, characterized of necessity 
by an amount of inertia. To the mass of the moving bin to be driven, 
there adds the mass of the sheets discharged thereinto, 
which may attain significant levels if an operator will 
not remove the printed sheets at frequent intervals. This problem is obviated by the  
 
electrophotographic apparatus with job offset sorter 
device of this invention, wherein no moving bin is used 
and sorting is performed by imparting, to the printed 
sheets being discharged from the apparatus, a rotation 
in the plane of the sheet to bring different sheets to 
at least two different

An electrophotographic apparatus (1) 

incorporating a sorter device, wherein a fixing station 
(8,9) imparts a predetermined forward speed, along an 

outgoing path of travel, to a print carrier with two 
side bands extending along said forward direction, one 

side of the print carrier having an image fixed 
thereon, characterized in that it comprises: 

   first (12) and second (15) friction 
entrainment rollers adapted to be driven independently 

and being arranged axially along a transverse direction 
to said outgoing path and respectively juxtaposed to 

third (18) and fourth (19) freely rotating pressure 
rollers, said print carrier being conveyed to said 

rollers to interpose said two side bands between said 
first (12) and third (18) rollers and said second (15) 

and fourth (19) rollers, respectively, with the side 
having the image fixed thereon in contact with said 

third (18) and fourth (19) rollers; 
   a first means (14) of imparting a first 

predetermined peripheral velocity to said first roller 
(12); 

   a second means (32) controlled to selectively 
impart, to said second roller (15), a second peripheral 

velocity selected from at least one of a higher 
 

velocity than said first peripheral velocity and a 
lower velocity than said first peripheral velocity; 

   a control means (26,29) for said second 
means; and 

   a print carrier collecting bin (3). 
An apparatus as in Claim 1, wherein said 
first peripheral velocity is higher than said forward 

speed and said second velocity is not lower than said 
forward speed. 
An apparatus as in Claim 1, wherein said 
first peripheral velocity is equal to said forward 

speed, said second controlled means (32) selectively 
imparting, to said second roller (15), a second 

peripheral velocity selected from one of a higher 
velocity than said first peripheral speed, a lower 

velocity than said first peripheral velocity, and a 
velocity equal to said forward speed, and further

   identification means (27) of the position of 

said print carrier along said outgoing path, connected 
to said control means (26,29) to signal release of a 

print carrier from said fixing station (8,9) to said 
control means (26,29), said control means (26,29) 

controlling said second means (32) to impart, to said 
second roller (15), a different peripheral velocity 

 
from said forward speed for a predetermined time period 

upon a print carrier exiting said fixing station (8,9). 
An apparatus as in the preceding claims,

shaft (13) to which said first roller (12) is keyed, 
and a fixed drive ratio mechanical transmission between 

a first motive means (MI) of said fixing station and
