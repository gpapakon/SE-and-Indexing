<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for treating a material web, preferably for dewatering a paper web (2) in the impulse drying process, having a heating roll (3) and a counter-support (4), which forms a press nip (5) together with the heating roll (3), at least the heating roll (3) consisting of a stationary axle, a roll cover (7) and at least one supporting element for supporting the roll cover (7) on the axle and the roll cover (7) has a base layer (9) and a thin ceramic operating layer (10) applied onto the base layer (9), the operating layer (10) having an improved energy efficiency and at the same time an improved mechanical stability. It is proposed that the ceramic operating layer (10) has a thickness of less than 1 mm, that the base layer (9) consists of a ceramic material as a thermal insulation and that the base layer (9) has a thickness which is larger than the thickness of the ceramic operating layer (10).

An apparatus for treating a material web, preferably for 
dewatering a paper web (2) in the pulse drying method, 

comprising a heating roll (3) and a counter bearing (4) 
which together with the heating roll (3) forms a pressing 

gap (5), at least the heating roll (3) comprising a stationary 
axle, a roll case (7) consisting of cast iron 

and at least one bearing element for supporting the roll 
case (7) on the axle and the roll case (7) including a 

coating containing a foundation (9) consisting of a ceracim 
material as heat insulation and layer and a thin ceramic 

heatable surface layer (10) applied to the foundation 
layer, in which the ceramic working layer (10) has a 

thickness of less than 1 mm; and
 
   the foundation layer (9) has a thickness which is greater 

than the thickness of the ceramic working layer,
