<ABSTRACT>
A method for facilitating autologous blood use by a patient facing a loss of blood, comprising the steps of removing and preferably storing a portion of the patient's blood, intravenously administering a biocompatible liquid in sufficient quantity to substantially maintain the patient's hemodynamic stability, wherein the liquid comprises an effective oxygen-delivery enhancing amount of a biocompatible synthetic oxygen carrier, after which the patient undergoes a loss of blood, and then readministering blood to the patient, preferably the stored blood. Also disclosed are use of biocompatible synthetic oxygen carriers in preparation of medicaments for use in the method, and compositions of such oxygen carriers for use in the method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improved medical
procedures in which addition of a synthetic oxygen carrier in
connection with autologous blood replacement (and, preferably,
in connection with hemodilution) is used to reduce or
eliminate the need for homologous blood.More than 13 million units of blood are collected each
year in the United States alone, and about 10 million of these
units are transfused into 4 million recipients. Of the
transfused units, about two-thirds are used during surgical
procedures, and the remainder are used primarily for treating
severe anemia or in emergency indications. Experience from
clinical studies suggests that postoperative recovery can be
shortened if hemoglobin concentrations are not allowed to fall
to below 10 g/dL, the generally accepted indication for
transfusion (Zauder, Anesth. Clin. North Amer 8:471-80
(1990)). This criterion, however, is currently being
reevaluated due in part to a recent increase in awareness of
the risks associated with homologous blood transfusion (NIH
Consensus Conference JAMA 260:2700-2703 (1988)). This has
also resulted in a renewed interest in the use of autologous
blood transfusion techniques, in particular predonation and
acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH).Although autologous blood transfusion (i.e., reinfusion
of the patient's own blood) was first employed over 170 years
ago, it was not until the early 1970s that its use became more
widespread because of growing concerns about the transmission
of hepatitis. More recently, interest in autologous
transfusions on the part of both patients and physicians has
been stimulated by the emergence of AIDS. Despite an
increased awareness and acceptance of the benefits of
autologous blood transfusion, recent studies have revealed the
widespread underutilization of autologous predonation (which 
is estimated to represent only 2-5% of all units drawn
nationwide).
Fukushima K. et al., Jp. J. Anesthesiol. 30, no. 7: 741-745
(1981) disclose intraoperative prebleeding, hemodilution and
autologous blood transfusion with a solution of Fluosol-DA
(biocompatible synthetic oxygen carrier) to a patient
undergoing right hemicolectomy. The outcome of some surgical procedures may be improved
by reducing blood viscosity prior to surgery. This can be
accomplished with ANH at the start of an operation (Stehling
et al. Transfusion 31:857 (1991)). ANH is a procedure whereby
several units of blood are withdrawn from the patient at the
beginning of surgery and simultaneously replaced with either
a crystalloid or a

<CLAIMS>
Use of a biocompatible, synthetic, oxygen-carrying
liquid for the manufacture of a medicament for enhancing the

oxygen-delivery capacity of a patient's blood,

by removing and storing a portion of the patient's
blood;
intravenously administering said biocompatible
liquid in sufficient quantity to maintain the patient's

blood volume;
having said patient undergo a loss of blood
subsequent to the administration of the biocompatible

liquid;
administering breathing gas enriched in oxygen to
said patient during said loss of blood; and
readministering said stored blood to said patient.
The use of Claim 1, wherein said biocompatible
liquid further comprises a hemodiluent.
The use of Claim 1 or 2, wherein said biocompatible liquid comprises
an oxygen carrier

derived from human, animal, plant, or recombinant hemoglobin.
The use of Claim 1 or 2, wherein said
biocompatible liquid comprises an oxygen carrier that is

a fluorocarbon emulsion.
The use of Claim 2, wherein said
biocompatible liquid comprises an oxygen carrier that is

a fluorocarbon emulsion and the volume of said administered
oxygen carrier is less than 50% of the volume of said

hemodiluent.
The use of Claim 4, wherein said fluorocarbon
emulsion has a concentration of at least 40%, w/v.
The use of Claim 6, wherein the concentration of
said fluorocarbon emulsion is at least 60%, w/v.
The use of Claim 2, wherein said hemodiluent is a
crystalloid, colloid, or a combination thereof.
The use of any one of Claims 1 to 8, wherein said blood loss is
associated with surgery.
The use of any one of Claims 1 to 8, wherein said blood loss is
associated with trauma. 
The use of any one of Claims 1 to 10, wherein the amount of oxygen
carrier administered is between about 0.5 and 10 g/kg, based

on the body weight of the patient.
The use of any one of Claims 1 to 11, wherein the concentration of
said oxygen breathing gas is about 50-100%.
The use of any one of Claims 1 to 12, wherein said quantity of
biocompatible liquid is from about 75% to about 300% of the

volume of blood removed in said removing step.
