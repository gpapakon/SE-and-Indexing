<ABSTRACT>
A method of silver recovery is provided in which a radiation sensitive 
device comprising a gelatin-based silver-containing coating and a substrate 

is treated with a wash liquor comprising an aqueous solution containing an 
enzyme capable of causing degradation of the gelatin, and a flocculating 

agent. This treatment removes the coating from the substrate and 
flocculates the non-useful silver, which is then separated and recovered.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the recovery of silver and is
principally concerned with recovering silver from high sensitivity
printing plates.The well-known comparatively high sensitivity to light of silver
halides over conventional photopolymeric materials and their ability
to respond to light from ultra-violet to infra-red make them ideally
suited for use in printing plate applications where direct-to-plate
exposure, rather than exposure through a contact film intermediate,
is called for.Silver halides in this context can be used in a variety of ways.
Printing plates, in general, include at least one layer of
photosensitive material; such a layer may comprise a silver halide in
combination with gelatin or other matrix binder. Oxidised developing
agent, which is generated on development of exposed silver halide,
can crosslink the gelatin or other matrix binder, so providing a
tough, ink-receptive image. This technique is often referred to as
tanning development. Alternatively, a silver halide emulsion layer
can be overcoated onto a conventional photopolymerisable layer of a
printing plate. The consequence of the difference in sensitivity
between the layers is that, at a given intensity of radiation, a
short light exposure can be used to imagewise expose the top silver
halide layer which, on development, forms a mask for a longer,
blanket, light exposure to convert the polymeric layer into a soluble
or insoluble form depending on the nature of the photopolymer.A third general use of silver halide in printing plate
applications is the well known technique of diffusion transfer
reversal (DTR). In this method a developer is used which chemically
develops exposed areas of the photosensitive coating whilst at the
same time dissolving the unexposed areas. The dissolved areas of 
silver halide, generally in the form of silver thiosulphate or
thiocyanate complexes, diffuse to a nucleation layer where metallic
silver is formed by reduction of the complexes. This silver can be
made oleophilic, for example by use of a mercapto compound such as 1-phenyl-5-mercaptotetrazole,
and used as the printing image of a
lithographic printing plate.In the latter two examples in particular, silver in a coated
layer is generated as a by-product which plays no part in the final
printing process. The problem then arises of recovering this "non-useful"
silver.In DTR systems which comprise two separate sheets, one
containing the light sensitive silver halide coating and the other
coated with a nucleating agent, the chemically developed

A method for removing a gelatin-based silver-containing coating from
an exposed and developed printing plate precursor comprising said

coating and a substrate, and subsequently recovering the silver, which
method comprises: treating said exposed and developed printing plate

precursor with a wash liquor, thereby to remove the coating from the
substrate and to flocculate the silver; separating the flocculated silver;

recovering the silver; and recirculating the wash liquor for the treatment
of further exposed and developed printing plate precursors,


characterised in that
 the wash liquor comprises an aqueous solution
containing an enzyme capable of causing degradation of the gelatin,

and a flocculating agent, 
and in that
 the method is a continuous
process for the recovery of silver and the processing of printing plates.
A method of processing a printing plate precursor comprising a
substrate coated with a radiation-sensitive composition including silver

halide and a gelatin-containing binder, which method comprises:

(i) imagewise exposing the coating to radiation;
(ii) applying developer to cause (a) the silver halide in the exposed
areas to be chemically developed so as to form metallic silver

dispersed in the gelatin-containing binder, and (b) the silver halide
in the non-exposed areas to dissolve and diffuse, in the form of

silver complexes, to a nucleation layer so as to form the metallic
silver printing image by reduction of the complexes;
(iii) washing the printing plate precursor with a washing solution,
thereby to remove the coating from the substrate to form a 

flocculated suspension of metallic silver, and recovering the
suspension;
(iv) separating the silver from the suspension;
(v) recirculating the washing solution; and
(vi) repeating steps (i) to (v) with further precursors as desired,

 said washing solution comprises an aqueous
