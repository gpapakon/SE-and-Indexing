<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the modification of organic 
polymer surfaces and the articles produced therefrom. 
Particularly, the invention relates to organic polymers having a 
surface modified to improve the adhesive characteristics of such 
polymers. It is well known in the art to surface treat organic 
polymers such as polyesters to improve the utility of such 
polymers. For example, it is known to treat polyester fibers to 
improve the adhesion of the polyester to substances such as 
rubber in the manufacture of tires. In U.S. Patent No. 
4,054,634, multifilament polyethylene terephthalate yarn is 
treated with a two-part finish, one part of which is applied 
after spinning and one part of which is applied after drawing. 
The first part contains a defined polyoxyethylated-polyoxypropylated 
monoether whereas the second part contains the 
monoether in combination with a defined epoxy ether silane and a 
sufficient amount of a water soluble alkaline catalyst to raise 
the pH to 8-10. Also see U.S. Patent No. 4,348,517 wherein the 
same epoxy ether silane is combined with the triglycidyl ether of  
 
a glycerol and a defined diglycidyl ether and is used as a fiber 
finish for polyester yarn. U.S. Pat. No. 3,793,425 also describes a process for 
improving the adhesion of polyester material to rubber. In the 
process, undrawn polyester yarn is coated with a composition 
containing an epoxy resin which is preferably buffered with an 
alkaline agent, such as sodium carbonate, lithium carbonate, 
potassium carbonate or ammonium hydroxide. The use of epoxy 
resins with alkaline catalysts to improve the adhesion of 
polyester to rubber is further disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 
3,423,230 and 3,464,878. A process for treating chemically stabilized polyester 
material to improve the adhesion of the polyester to rubber is 
also described in U.S. 4,751,143. As noted therein, the aging 
period for chemically stabilized, adhesive activated polyester 
material can be reduced by contacting the material before it is 
substantially drawn or stretched with a composition containing a 
defined epoxide compound catalyzed with ions of at least one of 
potassium, cesium, or rubidium at a pH of between about 7.5 to 
about 13.0. The application of finishes to the polymer surface generally 
produces a temporary surface condition such as lubrication or 
electrostatic charge dissipation which may be removed when the  
 
surface is subsequently exposed to multiple processing steps. 
Additionally, polyester surface modifications
