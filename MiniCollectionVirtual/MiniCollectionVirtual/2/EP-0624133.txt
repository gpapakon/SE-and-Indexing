<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a blade for wiping motor vehicle windscreens. The wiper blade comprises an elongated wiper blade (20) bearing on the windscreen and a supporting frame (14) which grips the wiper blade (20) along its long sides by at least two claws (16) arranged on bracket-like frame components (14) and, a securing component (22) being fixed near one end of the wiper blade thereto, locks the claws (16) with two mutually parallel arms (26, 28) and grips them behind the claws (16) with securing means (22). A closed wiper blade (20) can easily be removed and replaced in that the securing component (22) has a base section (24) with a U-shaped cross section which fits tightly on the end of the wiper strip, at least the arms (26, 28) of the securing component (26, 28) are made of a flexible plastic and the free end of one arm (28) is fitted with the engagement means forming the securing means, to which are allocated the counter engagement means of the other arm (26).

Wiper blade (10) for wiping motor vehicle windscreens, 
with an elongate wiper strip (20), which rests 

on the windscreen, and a supporting frame (12) which 
grasps the wiper strip (20), on its longitudinal sides, 

by means of at least two claws (16) arranged on bow-like 
frame parts (14), and a securing element (22), secured on 

this wiper strip close to one end thereof, with two arms 
(26, 28) which are approximately parallel to each other, 

crosses the claws (16) and behind the claws (16) engages 
behind the claw (16) with securing means (30), the 

securing element (22) having a base part (24) which is of 
U-shaped cross-section and can be pushed with a clamping 

fit onto the end of the wiper strip, and at least the 
arms (26, 28) of the securing element (22) consist of a 

flexible plastic, characterized in that one arm (28) is 
provided, on its free end portion, with securing means 

(72) which have latching means (74) and which are 
associated with counter-latching means (76) of the other 

arm (26), and in that the securing means (30) engage 

behind that holding claw (16) which is situated close to 
one end of the wiper strip, or behind that frame part 

(14) which belongs to the holding claw (16), when the 
latching connection between the latching and counterlatching 

means (74, 76) of the arms (28, 26) takes place. 
Wiper blade according to Claim 1, in which the 
wiper strip has a head strip which extends over its 

entire length, is connected, via a tilting web, to an 
elongate wiper lip and in which, relative to its axis of 

symmetry, there are arranged two longitudinal grooves 
which lie opposite one another and in which elongate  

 
spring rails are located, characterized in that the two 

spring rails (42) each have a recess (44), which recesses 
lie opposite one another on the outsides of said spring 

rails, are open on the edge and in which holding teeth 
(54, 56), which are arranged on the mutually facing sides 

of the U-limbs (46, 48) of the securing element (22), 
engage. 
Wiper blade according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that strip-like projections (60, 62) which are 

arranged on the free ends of the U-limbs (46, 48) and are 
directed towards one another, engage in longitudinal 

groove-like channels (64, 66) of the head strip (32). 
Wiper blade according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that on its wall (50) which connects the 

two U-limbs (46, 48), the base part (24) has an inwardly 
projecting clamping extension (52). 
Wiper blade according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the two arms (26, 28) extend away 

from the base part (24) in the push-on direction (arrow 
68), and in that at that end of the base part (24) which 

is remote from the arms the two U-limbs (46, 48) thereof 
are connected by an end wall (70). 
Wiper blade according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the latching means and counterlatching 

means are formed by a transverse tongue (72) at 
the end of one arm (28), which tongue has an opening 

(74), and by a lateral extension (76) on the other arm 
(26), which extension fits into the opening (74). 
Wiper blade according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that on its side which is remote from the arm (28) 

with the transverse tongue (72), the opening (74) has a 
wall region which has an undercut (α) acting as securing 

means. 
Wiper blade according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the extension (76) has a side cheek region (78), 

the profile of which, with the arms (26, 28) latched 
together, is matched to the profile of the undercut (α). 
Wiper blade according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the base part (24), the arms (26,  

 
28) and the securing means (72, 76) are manufactured in 

one piece from flexible plastic.
