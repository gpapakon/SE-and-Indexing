<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for the manipulation of articles, 
having a manipulator with at least one arm, which 

comprises a coupling member (7), in which slide bolts 
(27) are disposed for releasing a locking connection 

between coupling member (7) and a handling apparatus 
(11), a storage unit (32) being associated with the 

manipulator for the accommodation of the handling 
apparatus (11) by means of strips (35), and these 

strips (35) are respectively shaped to fit on two bars 
(33, 34) extending substantially parallel for the 

actuation of the slide bolts (27), characterised in 
that the slide bolt (27) is disposed in a transverse 

bore (28) perpendicular to a longitudinal axis (A) of 
the coupling member (7), and an additional chamber 

(19) is provided beneath the transverse bore (28), 
which chamber extends perpendicular to the 

longitudinal axis (A), and in which chamber a locking 
bolt (18) extends, the locking bolt (18) being 

connected to the slide bolt via a pivotal lever (21). 
Arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the pivotal lever (21) has a 

pivot point (22) substantially centrally and engages  
 

at both ends with a respective head (23 or 25 
respectively) both in a recess (24) in the locking 

bolt (18) and in a recess (28) in the slide bolt (27). 
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the locking bolt (18, 18a) 

engages in an annular groove (13) of a pin (12) by 
means of a locking projection (17), which pin is 

shaped to fit on the handling apparatus (11). 
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the slide bolt (17) is supported 

against a helical spring (29) in the transverse 
bore (28). 
Arrangement according to at least one of 
claims 1 - 4, characterised in that a storage unit 

aperture (37) has a funnel-shaped configuration, the 
spacing of the two bars (33, 34) and of the strips 

(35) from the storage unit aperture (37) tapering 
inwardly.
