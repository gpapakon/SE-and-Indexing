<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an Fe-M-C 
magnetic film and a method of producing the same. For 
example, this magnetic film is used as a magnetic head 
material for a VCR, a magnetic disk device or the like, 
as a core material for an ultramicro inductor contained 
in the inside of an integrated circuit or as a magnetic 
pole material for an ultramicro motor, or the like. As well known, such a conventional magnetic 
film has been produced, for example, by a thin-film 
forming technique such as sputtering, or the like, and 
used in the field of various information appliances such 
as a recording/reproducing head for a magnetic disk, and 
so on. In recent years, heightening of recording 
density has advanced remarkably in the field of magnetic 
recording. Therefore, the development of a magnetic 
film for a magnetic head having high saturation magnetic 
flux density has been required so that recording can be 
made sufficiently in a recording medium of high coercive 
force. Further, from a point of view of reproduction of 
a recording signal, it has been required that permeability 
is high and magnetostriction approaches a value near 
zero. On the other hand, from a point of view of the 
magnetic head producing process, it has been required 
that durability against heat in heat treatment is high.  As a magnetic film satisfying the requirements, 
an Fe-Al-Si alloy system (Sendust) and an 
amorphous alloy such as Co-Nb-Zr, Co-Ta-Zr, etc. have 
been developed and put into practical use (JP-A-60-74110). 
Even these magnetic films are not always 
satisfactory. For example, in the case of Sendust, the 
saturation magnetic flux density is about 1 T and 
accordingly Sendust is not always satisfactory. For 
example, even in the case of a Co amorphous metal high 
in temperature durability, the allowable temperature is 
about 500°C and accordingly the Co amorphous metal is 
not always sufficient to satisfy the conditions for the 
magnetic head producing process. As an attempt to improve these points, a 
magnetic film exhibiting saturation magnetic flux 
density of from 1.3 T to 1.7 T and durability against a 
temperature of about 600°C in heat treatment has been 
developed by using an Fe-N thin film and an Fe(Co)-M-C 
film (in which M=V, Nb, Ta, Ti, Zr, or the like) 
[[Journal of The Magnetics Society of Japan, Vol. 14, 
pp. 313-318 (1990) and Vol. 14, pp. 319-322 (1990)]]. In these magnetic films, however, for example, 
in the case of M=Ta, microcrystalline clusters of Fe and 
TaC or microcrystalline clusters of
