<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method of fixing a polystyrene-based toner on a reproduction medium (AT) in a printing or copying machine, a solvent (LM) being vaporized in a fixing device (FR) and allowed to act in the vaporized state on the toner. Used as the solvent are partly halogenated fluorocarbons such as R183 or R141b which have a low polluting action and which have a high solvent action on toners with a non-crosslinked polymer matrix comprising a base matrix made from polystyrene and meta-acrylates.

Method for fixing a polystyrene-based toner on a 
recording medium (AT) of a printer or copier, whereby a 

solvent (LM) is evaporated in a fixing device (FR) and 
influences the toner in this condition, characterized in 

that a partly halogenated chlorofluorohydrocarbon having 
a boiling point below 35°, selected from CHCl₂-CF₃ and 

CFCl₂-CH₃, is used as the sole solvent (LM) and a toner 
having an uncrosslinked polymer matrix whose polymer base 

matrix consists of polystyrene and methacrylates is used 
as the toner.
