<ABSTRACT>
A soil-working apparatus, such as a lawnmower (1a), possesses, at the shortest possible separating distance immediately in front of a mowing implement (9a) rotating in a horizontal plane, a scarifying implement (8a) which rotates about a horizontal transverse axis (11a) in a movement accompanying the direction of advance (16a) and which is arranged in a common housing (35a), but in a separate housing space (37a). The scarifying implement (8a) is driven by the drive motor (22a) of the mowing implement (9a) in a manner uncouplable via a gear (24a) and is located essentially between the front running wheels (4a) which are vertically adjustable for the joint setting of the working height of the two implements (8a, 9a). As a result, work can be carried out separately with either of the implements (8a, 9a) and also with both of them simultaneously, so that a large number of possible uses are obtained.
