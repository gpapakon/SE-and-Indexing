<ABSTRACT>
A drive system for varying the diameter of a variable diameter rotor has a gear assembly associated with a single coaxial shaft (13) lower end which includes a gear set for increasing the speed of rotation of the central shaft (13) relative to the rotor drive shaft (2) to change the diameter of the variable diameter blades. A pair of brakes are used, one (37) to slow the coaxial shaft relative to the drive shaft and another (25) to lock the rotor shaft (2) and coaxial shaft (13) together for corotation during constant diameter flight conditions. Utilizing a lower gear assembly reduces hub complexity and allows the variable diameter rotor drive system to be adapted to gimballed rotors which require shaft flexibility. Since only a single shaft extends through the rotor drive shaft, hub complexity is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to variable diameter rotors for
aircraft and more particularly to a simplified drive system for
effecting retraction and extension of variable diameter rotor
blades.A tilt rotor aircraft is one which typically has a pair of
pods supported on aircraft wings for supporting a pair of rotors,
the pods being movable between a vertical position when the
rotors serve as helicopter rotors for vertical take-offs and
landings, and a horizontal position when the rotors serve as
propellers for forward flight.Generally, a large rotor diameter is advantageous for
operating the aircraft in the helicopter mode to provide low disk
loading which results in efficient operation, low noise levels
and diminished downwash velocities.On the other hand, a relatively small diameter is
advantageous in the propeller mode to reduce tip speed and blade
area for improved propulsion efficiency, minimized blade aero-elastic
properties and to simplify ground handling.Various mechanisms are known for providing the means for
extending and retracting variable diameter rotor blades. For 
example, in U.S. Patent No. 3,768,923, a jackscrew and nut
arrangement is used to produce telescopic motion between inner
and outer blade portions. (see Fig. 1) Two coaxial shafts 1 and 2
are connected to upper and lower beveled gears 3 and 4 to form
part of a differential unit which includes pinion gears 5 and 6
which are connected to the jackscrew shafts 7 and 8 in each
blade. The coaxially shafts rotate with the rotor drive shaft 9
during constant diameter operation. However, each shaft has a
brake 10 and 11 such that when the brake is applied, the selected
shaft and rotor rotate at different speeds. Depending on which
shaft undergoes braking, this speed differential drives the
respective bevel gear and jackscrews for rotation, with rotation
in different directions depending on which brake is applied to
which coaxial shaft. Thus, application of the brake to one
shaft will drive the jackscrew to either extend or retract the
rotor blade.While such an assembly is acceptable in some circumstances,
such as with articulated or hingeless rotor hubs, it is quite
complex and difficult to incorporate into a gimbelled rotor hub
which requires shaft flexibility.U.S. Patent No. 2,852,207 describes a shaft 61 used with a
cable 53 wound on a drum 55 in a blade retraction system. Gears
58 engage an internal gear 59 on the drum and a sun gear
connected to an upper end of the shaft 1. A clutch is used for
retraction and centrifugal force used for
