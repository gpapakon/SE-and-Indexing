<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides poisonous baits exhbiting an 
excellent control effect on soil-inhabiting pests. 
Poisonous baits for controlling soil-inhabiting pests comprising 
active compounds for controlling soil-inhabiting pests and, as 

excipient, an artificial culture medium for mushrooms or the medium 
obtained after the culture thereof. 
The poisonous baits according to the present invention have 
not only an excellent attracting action on soil-inhabiting pests 

but also an excellent control effect and, moreover, after the application 
thereof into soil they are decomposed to organic manure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to baits effectively used for controlling pests
inhabiting soil.Japanese Patent Application Publication No. Sho 63-26721, Japanese Patent
Application Disclosures Nos. Sho 61-183201, Sho 62-19505, Sho 63-218604,
Sho 63-218605, and Hei 1-143806, etc., disclose poisonous baits having an
improved edibility.Further, Japanese Patent Application Disclosure No. Sho 63-135308 disclosed the
utilization of microorganism as a pesticidal agent.Moreover, Japanese Patent Application Disclosure No. Hei 2-124802 disclosed
stabilized control agents for soil-inhabiting pests comprising vegetable organic
matter.The inventors of the present application have now found baits for controlling soil-inhabiting
pests comprising active compounds represented by the general formula

wherein R represents hydrogen atom, an acyl, alkyl or an optionally substituted
heteroarylalkyl,
Arepresents hydrogen atom, an alkyl or a divalent group connected to the
substituent B, Brepresents an alkyl, ―S―R,

or a divalent group connected to
the substituent A, wherein R has the same meaning as mentioned above,Yrepresents =N- or

wherein T1 represents hydrogen atom or an
optionally substituted alkyl group, andXrepresents an electron attractive group
comprising as excipients materials used as artificial culture media for mushrooms
selected from crushed or ground wood or wood chips of broadleaved trees and
comprising binders selected from: Starch, soluble starch, α-starch, dextrin,
amylose, amiropectin, lignin, sodium lignin sulfonate, potassium ligninsulfonate,
calcium ligninsulfonate, cellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl
cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl
cellulose, carboxymethyl starch, hydroxypropyl starch, sodium carboxymethyl
cellulose, gum arabic, gelatin, casein, xanthane gum, alginic acid, sodium alginate,
sodium silicate, polyvinyl alcohol, polypropylene glycol, polyethylenepolypropylene
block polymer, sodium polyacrylate.These baits exhibit an excellent pesticidal activity on soil-inhabiting pests.The baits according to the present invention can be prepared according to
conventional production processes such as tabletting, briquetting, etc., wherein an
artificial culture medium for mushrooms or the medium obtained after the culture
thereof, is dried, followed by adding thereto, the below-mentioned active
compounds for controlling soil-inhabiting pests, together with
adjuvants such as binder and like.As active compounds for controlling
