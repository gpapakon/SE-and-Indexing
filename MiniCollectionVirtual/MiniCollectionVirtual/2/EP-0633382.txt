<ABSTRACT>
The window (7) is flush with its frame (6) at its surface towards the inside, fittings on both being accommodated in the intervening gap. The latter is masked by opposite protrusions (3,1) on window and frame, that on the latter forming a groove (2). That on the window has a rounded surface to match the groove and which is concentric to the window hinge axis (14). At the gap, the window and frame can be profiled to a depth of less than 30 mm. being formed by a triple cemented carbide milling cutter. Where of wood, the window can be in several sections for better weather protection.

<CLAIMS>
A window having a fixed frame (6) and a movable frame
(7), the supporting structure thereof being made of wood,

with or without an aluminum shell (5) fitted to the outer
surface of the frame,


said movable frame (7) being pivotally mounted to said
fixed frame (6) at least about a vertical or horizontal

axis of rotation (14),
having a rabbet space formed by recesses (8, 9) of the
fixed and the movable frame, in which fittings are arranged

and which is covered at the inner face of the window by a
covering projection (3) of said movable frame (7) which

projection projects toward said fixed frame (6) in parallel
to the plane of said frame,
said fixed frame (6) and said movable frame (7) having
visible surfaces at the inner face (30) of the window which

are co-planar to each other,
characterized
 in that

the axis of rotation (14) of said movable frame (7) is
positioned within the cross section of the movable frame a

distance from its inside visible surface,
that a hollow groove (2) of said fixed frame (6) directed
toward the covering projection (3) in the direction of the

plane of the frame is opposed to the covering projection
(3) of said movable (7) at a distance selected so as to not

interfere with an adjustment range (10) between said fixed
frame (6) and said movable frame (7) of about 3 mm and

within this adjustment range the view on the fittings
arranged in said rabbet space is blocked by said covering 

projection (3) and the salient part (1) of the hollow
groove (2), and that the covering projection (3) is rounded

out toward the inner face of the window with a curvature
(12) adapted to said hollow groove (2) which curvature, at

the spar of the movable frame on the side of the axis of
rotation, is roughly concentric to the axis of rotation

(14) of the movable frame (7) and together with the opposed
hollow groove (2) constitutes a blurred shadow without any

sharp edge.
A window according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that at least at the spar of the movable
frame on the side of the lock the hollow groove (2) of said

fixed frame (6) is set back with respect to the rabbet face
(4) of said fixed frame.
A window according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that at least at the spar of the movable
frame on the side of the hinge strap the rabbet space is

covered by projections (1, 3) directed towards each other
of said fixed and movable frames and that the hollow groove

(2) is formed at the projection (1) of said fixed frame.
A window according to any one of claims 1 to 3,

characterized
 in that the profile depth in
the fixed frame (6) and the movable frame (7) on the side

of the rabbet is less than 30 mm (32).
