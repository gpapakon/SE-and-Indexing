<ABSTRACT>
A physiologically active compound having the 
following chemical structure is disclosed. This compound 

is prepared by culturing 
Chromobacterium violaceum,
 
adding tryptophan and diethyldithiocarbamate 

(diethyldithiocarbamic acid) to the culture broth for 
reacting with the cells for producing it in the cells, 

and collecting the compound from the culture broth. This 
novel compound possesses antitumor and antimicrobial 

activity, and is effective as an antitumor agent or an 
antimicrobial agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a physiologically 
active compound HS-1 of the following formula (I) and to 
a process for preparing the same. The physiologically 
active compound HS-1 is useful as an antitumor agent or 
an antimicrobial agent. 
Chromobacterium violaceum is known as a 
microorganism producing a purple pigment. This purple 
pigment is named violacein (Beer, R. J., et al., J. Chem. 
Soc., 885 (1949); (Beer, R. J., et al., J. Chem. Soc., 
755 (1958)) and known to exhibit antimicrobial and 
antiprotozoal activities. This microorganism which  
 
produces violacein is known also to produce some 
physiologically active compounds other than violacein 
(HOSHINO, T. et al., Agric. Biol Chem., 54(9), 2339 
(1990)). Antitumor agents which are currently on actual use 
do not exhibit their activity on carcinoma based on 
distinct differences between cancer cells and normal 
cells, but identify cancer cells based on their vigorous 
division and growth activities, the capability of 
attracting substances, or the insufficient metabolizing 
activity. Selective toxicity actions of the conventional 
antitumor agents are therefore reduced on cancer cells 
which grow slowly. Because of this reason, most 
antitumor agents currently on use accompany serious side 
effects such as toxicity to heart, alopecia, 
gingivostomatitis, leukopenia, and gastrointestinal 
injury. The conventional antitumor agents have also a 
problem of drug tolerance. Therefore, there has been a 
desire for the development of a compound which can 
exhibit an antitumor activity based on a mechanism 
different from those in conventional antitumor agents. The present inventors have undertaken screening of 
various compounds produced by Chromobacterium violaceum 
which is the violacein-producing microorganism, and, 
among compounds produced by Chromobacterium violaceum in 
the presence of tryptophan, discovered a novel compound  
 
HS-1, having the chemical structure represented by the 
formula (I) below and exhibiting toxicity against cancer 
cells. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is 
to provide a novel physiologically active compound HS-1 
represented by the following chemical formula (I), 
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide a process of preparing this novel physiologically 
active compound HS-1, which comprises:
 
   culturing Chromobacterium violaceum capable of 
producing a physiologically active compound HS-1,
 
   adding tryptophan and
