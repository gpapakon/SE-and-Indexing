<ABSTRACT>
This device is of the type composed of at least one pair of opposed jaws capable of being clamped together by a threaded connection on at least one conductor. According to the invention, each of the jaws (2a, 2b) is obtained by the lengthwise cutting of an extruded metal section, comprising at least one longitudinal and axial groove (4), forming a channel of shape and size suitable for interacting when clamping the conductor, whereas the connection between two jaws (2a, 2b) of one pair of opposed jaws is provided by bolts (3) whose threaded ends are screwed into tapped holes (6) produced in one of the jaws and whose bodies pass through drill-holes (7) made in the other jaw, these tapped holes and drill-holes being distributed with a longitudinal pitch identical to their transverse pitch.

A connection device for electrical conductors for tapping or
terminal connections, of the type comprising at least one pair of

opposing jaws, adapted to be clamped by a threaded connection on at
least one conductor, characterised in that each of the jaws (2a,2b,2c)

results from cutting a desired length from an extruded metal profile
having at least one longitudinal and axial groove (4), constituting a

channel having a shape and dimensions adapted to cooperate in the
clamping of the conductor, whilst the connection between two jaws (2a-2b)

of a pair (A) of opposing jaws is effected by screws (3) of which the
threaded ends screw into tapped holes (6) formed in one of the jaws and

of which the bodies pass through bores (7) formed in the other jaw,
these tappings and bores being distributed with a longitudinal pitch (PL)

identical to their transverse pitch (PT), such that each pair of opposing
jaws constitutes a modular element.
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that at least two
of the screws (3) connecting two jaws (2a-2b or 2c) of a single pair of

jaws are associated with a means (8) adapted to separate them.
A device according to Claim 2, characterised in that each jaw
(2a,2b,2c) has, disposed to either side of the axial channel (4), and

parallel to it, two lateral grooves (5) of which the bases (5a) form bearing
surfaces for the corresponding ends of one or more separating means and

of which the edges (5b) form transverse centering elements for these
separating means. 
A device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that at least one of the pairs (A) of jaws is joined by its clamping screws

(3) to a fixing plate (9).
A device according to Claim 4, characterised in that the fixing
plate (9) is rectilinear and ensures the connection of at least two pairs of

jaws forming a "T" connection.
A device according to Claim 4, characterised in that the fixing
plate (9) projects beyond the jaw and forms a fixing area.
A device according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in
that one of the jaws (2a,2b,2c) of at least one pair of jaws has a central

tapping (12) therethrough for the threaded end (10) of a fixing support
(C).
A device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that the juxtaposed and independent jaws (2a) of an assembly of several

pairs of jaws are connected to a common opposed jaw (2c) extending
over a length equal to the lengthwise space required by the independent

jaws.
A device according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in
that each of its constituent el
ements, namely jaws (2a,2b,2c), fixing plate
(9) or connection plate (13) and support (C) are plated.
