<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for transforming a distorted input picture produced by an X-ray exposure, which picture is composed of picture elements defined by their position and their respective input picture value, into an essentially distortion-free output picture, which is composed of picture elements defined by their position and their output picture value. In this case, an improvement is achieved by determining the position of the corner points of the picture elements of the output picture (or of the input picture, respectively) and the area of the polygons defined by the corner points in the input picture (output picture).

A method for transforming a distorted input image (B
i
) produced by an X-ray
exposure and composed of pixels defined by their position (u,v) and their respective

input image value (B
i
(u,v)), into a substantially distortion-free output image (B
o
) composed
of pixels defined by their position (x,y) and their output image value (B
o
(x,y)),

characterized in that
 the position (u,v) of the comer points (i,j) of the pixels of the output
image (B
o
) in the input image (B
i
) is determined as well as the surface area (F
1
 ... F
4
) of the
polygon defined by the comer points in the input image, the pixels of the output image

being assigned a respective output image value (B
o
(x,y)) which corresponds to the integral
of the input image values over the input image surface area covered by the associated

polygon.
A method for transforming a distorted input image (B
i
), produced by an X-ray
exposure and composed of pixels defined by their position (u,v) and their respective

input image value (B
i
(u,v)), into a substantially distortion-free output image (B
o
) composed
of pixels defined by their position and their output image value, 
characterized in that
 the
position (x,y) of the comer points (i,j) of the pixels of the input image is determined in the

output image and also the surface area (F
1
 ... F
4
) of the polygon defined by the comer points
in the output image, the input image values (B
i
(u
2
,v
2
)) of the pixels whose comer points are
situated in a pixel of the output image being used, by weighted summing, to determine the

output image value (B
o
(x
2
,y
2
)) of the relevant pixel of the output image.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 first the position of the
comer points of all pixels is determined and stored before the image values of the input

image and the output image are assigned to one another.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the position of the
comer points belonging to a first row or column of pixels is calculated and stored, that

subsequently the assignment takes place for pixels of this row or column and the
corresponding polygons in the other image, that subsequently the position of the comer 

points of a second row or column of pixels, neighboring the first row or column, is
determined while utilizing the comer points of the pixels of the first row or column

associated with these pixels, after which the assignment of the image values is carried out
for the second row or column of pixels.
A device for carrying out the method claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 it includes:

a) an X-ray system (1,4) for generating an input image by way of an X-ray

exposure,
b) an image converter for converting the input image into a series of digital
image values constituting the input image (B
i
),
c) a storage device (10, 11) for storing input image values and output image
values,
d) means (7; 102; 202) for determining the position (u,v) of corner points of
one image (B
o
) in the other image as well as the surface area (F
1
 ... F
4
) of the polygons
defined by the corner points in the other image,
e) means (7; 103; 203) for assigning the image values of a pixel to the
associated polygon in the other image.
