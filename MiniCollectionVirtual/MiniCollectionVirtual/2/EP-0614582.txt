<ABSTRACT>
Digital demodulator processing (Fig. 5) is accomplished for the reception of burst transmission (401) without preamble overhead (Fig. 3b) for synchronization acquisition. It is assumed that the modulation technique is either binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) (250) or quarternary phase-shift keying (QPSK) (250). The required synchronization (506), filtering (504, 505) and detection (512) functions for the demodulator are performed sequentially by repeated digital processing of stored complex baseband samples (501) of the received transmission burst (401).

<DESCRIPTION>
 DIGITAL DEMODULATOR FOR PREAMBLE-LESS BURST COMMUNICATIONSFIELD OF INVENTIONThe present invention relates to digital demodulators used, for example, in burst communications applications. More specifically, the invention relates to such demodulators which perform demodulation without the use of a synchronization preamble attached to data bursts.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In the past, burst communications has usually required a synchronization preamble for the acquisition of carrier synchronization and symbol synchronization prior to synchronous, coherent detection of the modulation symbols in the data burst. As described in C. Heegard, J. Heller and A. Viterbi, "A Microprocessor-Based PSK Modem for Packet Transmission Over Satellite Channels," IEEE Transactions on Communications. Vol. COM-26, No. 5, May 1978, pp. 552-564, a preamble is ordinarily employed for burst communications even when a digital demodulator is used for reception.U.S. Patent No. 4,466,108 describes a preamble- less approach to digital satellite burst communications that uses either binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) or quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation and time division multiple access (TDMA) by some N transmitting stations to share the same satellite transponder sequentially. In this preamble-' less approach, however, the carrier frequency is 

 assumed to be known with sufficient accuracy initially so that carrier frequency acquisition is not required.When the burst lengths are short, the overhead for synchronization preambles can result in a considerable loss of access efficiency. Also, methods for preamble-less burst reception that require accurate initial carrier frequency knowledge are not effective for low speed communications in. which the carrier frequency uncertainty can be significant relative to the modulation symbol rate.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a preamble-less approach to burst communications demodulators which does not suffer from the disadvantages mentioned above with respect to conventional demodulators.Specifically, it is an object of the invention to significantly reduce the overhead that need be included in conventional burst communications systems, such overhead taking the form of synchronization preambles.It is a still further object of the invention to reduce overhead while, at the same time, providing for demodulation situations, such as low speed communication rates, where the initial carrier frequency uncertainty can be great.In burst
