<ABSTRACT>
Novel mono- and multi-functional non-ionic urethane monomers are prepared 
from surfactants comprising poly(ethylene oxide)(butylene oxide) copolymers, 

preferably C₁-C₄ alkoxy-terminated, monohydric, ethylene oxide/butylene oxide 
block polymers and monoethylenically unsaturated aliphatic isocyanates. When 

polymerized with, e.g. acrylic acid or alkyl acrylates, these monomers provide 
copolymers exhibiting greatly enhanced thickening efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel non-ionic urethane compounds and emulsion
and solution polymers and copolymers comprising the non-ionic urethane compounds.
The polymers comprising these novel compounds thicken, modify rheology, stabilize,
suspend particles, control viscosity and otherwise enhance the physical
properties of latex systems, coating compositions, sizings and printing pastes,
paints, paper coatings, industrial coatings, petroleum drilling fluids, cleaners,
detergents, personal care products and other aqueous solution or emulsion
products.Various polymeric materials based on mono and dicarboxylic acids are known.
The properties of these polymers, in particular, the thickening efficiency of
these polymers, has been improved by the inclusion of various surfactant compounds
to produce associative copolymer thickening properties. These "associative
thickeners" (polymers comprising associative compounds) have found use in
materials such as lattices used as carpet and textile backing adhesives and in
similar applications. Such copolymers are described in U.S. Patent No.
-A-5,013,789, issued May 7, 1991, to Barron, et al. Surfactant compounds suitable
for making these associative copolymer thickeners are disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. -A-5,011,978, issued April 30, 1991, to Barron, et al.Other surfactant compounds and copolymers prepared from such compounds which
are characterized by associative thickening properties are disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. -A-4,743,698, issued May 10, 1988, to Ruffner, et al., and U.S. Patent
No. -A-4,600,761, issued July 15, 1986, to Ruffner, et al. The Ruffner compounds
are copolymers prepared from an urethane reaction product of a non-ionic
monohydric surfactant or a sorbitan fatty ester. The Barron compound and
copolymers are derived from the reaction product of a non-ionic amine-containing
surfactant with an unsaturated isocyanate. When preparing copolymers of these
compounds with acrylic acid, the urea (or urethane) compound is incorporated into
the backbone of the polymer along with the comonomers.An associative thickener copolymer disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
-A-4,514,552, issued April 30, 1985, to Shay, et al., and reissued as U.S. Patent
No. -B-Re33,156, January 30, 1990, to Shay, et al., comprises an acrylic 
backbone, together with urethane side chains modified with poly(alkoxy)
(surfactant) moieties. The surfactant moieties contain C6-C22 alkyl or C8-C22
aryl terminal groups to provide hydrophobicity to the side chains. A
propoxylated alkali-soluble thickener
