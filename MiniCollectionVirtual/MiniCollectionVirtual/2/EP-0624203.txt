<CLAIMS>
The use of at least substantially storage-stable, 
supersaturated and acidified aqueous solutions of mixtures 

of aluminium triformate with alkali metal and/or 
alkaline earth metal formate as a concentrated formulation 

of an aqueous solution of a mineral tanning agent 
based on aluminium triformate for the chrome-free or low-chrome 

tanning of leather and/or skins. 
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
mixtures of aluminium triformate with sodium formate 

which have been produced in particular by reaction of 
aqueous sodium aluminate solution with formic acid are 

present. 
The use claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterized in 
that the solids contents of the formate salt mixtures in 

the aqueous concentrates are at least 35% by weight, 
preferably at least 40% by weight and, more preferably, 

above 50% by weight. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the mixing ratios of aluminium triformate to sodium 

formate are in the range from 0.5 to 2:1, based on the 
ratio by weight of Al₂O₃ to Na₂O. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that the aqueous concentrates have pH values of not more 

than 5 and preferably in the range from pH 3 to 4. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that they are formulated as storable, supersaturated and 

at least substantially separation-free and readily water-dilutable 
concentrates which are liquid at room temperature 

and which have preferably been produced by reaction 
of an aqueous aluminate liquor with formic acid. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that the water-containing concentrates contain acid-resistant 

stabilizers which are preferably present in the 
water-containing concentrate in quantities below 5% by  

 
weight and, more preferably, in quantities of 0.1 to 2% 

by weight. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 7, characterized in 
that butane tetracarboxylic acid and/or acid-stable 

water-soluble and/or water-swellable polymer compounds, 
preferably butane te
tracarboxylic acid, are used as 
stabilizers. 
The use claimed in claims 7 and 8, characterized in 
that the water-containing concentrates contain butane 

tetracarboxylic acid in quantities of 0.5 to 1% by 
weight, based on water-containing concentrate. 
The use claimed in claims 1 to 9, characterized in 
that the water-containing concentrates are prepared by 

addition of an aqueous aluminate liquor with cooling to 
formic acid in a stoichiometric ratio, the temperature of 

the reaction mixture preferably not exceeding 25°C, subsequent 
heating of the reaction product to a temperature 

in the range from about 60 to 80°C, followed by cooling, 
the stabilizer, preferably butane tetracarboxylic acid, 

being added before or after the heating step. 
Storage-stable, supersaturated and acidified aqueous 
solutions of aluminium triformate in admixture with sodium 

formate with solids contents of the formate salt mixtures 
of at least 35% by weight and preferably at least 

40% by weight which contain small quantities of butane 
tetracarboxylic acid and xanthan gum as stabilizers. 
Supersaturated aluminium triformate solutions as 
claimed in claim 11, characterized in that they have pH 

values of not more than 5 and preferably in the range 
from pH 3 to 4. 
The use of the supersaturated aluminium triformate 
solutions claimed in claims 11 to 12 as water-dilutable 

aluminium triformate solutions already dissolved in water 
for use as tanning auxiliaries with a fixing and/or 

tanning effect in the tanning and/or finishing of leather 
and skins.
