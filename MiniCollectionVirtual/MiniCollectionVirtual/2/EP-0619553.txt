<ABSTRACT>
When determining areas, a data for determining area Ds, 
including bit data D₀ which shows whether the area to be 

processed or not, is stored in a frame memory for determining 
area 5. When carrying out image processing, the frame memory 5 

outputs the data Ds in synchronization with the output of image 
data D form a A/D converter 3. A gate 4 outputs the image data D 

only when the bit data D₀ is a value [1] representing the area to 

be processed. In Synchronization with the output of the data D, 
bit sequence D₁∼D
n
 is output as the additional data regarding to 
the area. In an image processing system(not shown), although the 

image processing is carried out for the whole of a frame memory, 
the image data D is not supplied except for the area shown by the 

bit data D₀ so as not to be carried out the image processing. 
Therefore, only for the area shown by the bit data D₀, the image 

processing is carried out in accordance with the bit sequence 
D₁∼D
n

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
determining image area to be processed when the image processing 
is carried out for image data. The image processing is well known, such as equalization or 
Fourier transform for image data stored in a frame memory of a 
computer. In the image processing, if it is necessary to carry 
out the image processing for a part of an image, for example, the 
object area is defined by assigning its address in a frame memory 
or by giving an equation representing its circumference. Then, 
the area is calculated on the basis of the above memory address 
or equation, and the process is carried out only for the area. In the above mentioned method for determining image areas, 
it needs a very long time for determining the areas in comparison 
with the time for processing the image data. Therefore, the 
process for determining area cannot catch up with the image 
processing in case the image processing is carried out in real 
time for the object moving quickly compared with the time for 
determining area. Furthermore, in case of determining a plurality of areas in 
one frame or carrying out different process for each area, it  
 
becomes difficult to carry out the real time processing because 
the more complex calculation is required. The object of the invention is therefore to provide an 
apparatus for determining image processing area which makes it 
possible to set image area for each pixel easily, to reduce the 
burden of the calculation to a large degree even if a plurality 
of areas are set in one frame, and to control processing for each 
pixel. In order to resolve the aforementioned problems, the 
invention of claim 1 is provided with:
 
   an image data outputting means for outputting image data 
consisting of pixels sequentially for each frame;
 
   an area setting memory which stores a distinction code/data 
in order to distinguish the areas to be processed from the other 
areas for each pixel in one frame, and outputs said distinction 
code/data in synchronization with the output of said image data;
 
   a gate means which is supplied with said image data and said 
distinction code/data, and outputs said image data only when said 
distinction code/data shows that the area is to be processed. In the present invention, the distinction code/data for each 
pixel, which shows whether the pixel is included in the area to 
be processed or not, is stored in the area setting memory 
previously. The distinction code/data is output form the area 
setting memory in
