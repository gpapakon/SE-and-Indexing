<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for measuring the condition of a receiver antenna at a base station, utilizing an antenna amplifier (15) positioned in connection with an antenna (6) apart from other base station equipments, e.g. at a mast. In the invention, a measuring signal is generated in connection (11) with the other base station equipments at a frequency outside the frequency band used for radio traffic and applied through an antenna line (7) to the antenna amplifier (15), in which the measuring signal is converted to the actual measuring frequency within the frequency band intended for the radio traffic.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an arrangement for
measuring the condition of a receiver antenna at a
base station of a system, the arrangement comprising
a receiver antenna positioned apart from other base
station equipments, e.g. at a mast; an amplifying
means positioned in connection with the antenna for
amplifying an antenna signal; a means for generating
a radio frequency measuring signal; a first directional
coupler means for applying the measuring signal
to an antenna line towards the antenna between
the amplifying means and the antenna; a second directional
coupler means for applying the measuring signal
to the antenna line towards the receiver between
the amplifying means and the antenna; switching means
for switching the radio frequency measuring signal
from the generating means alternately to the first
and the second directional coupler means; means for
measuring the strength of a measuring signal component
sent towards the antenna and reflected back from
the antenna and the strength of the measuring signal
sent directly towards the receiver.A substantial part of radio systems, for instance
cellular radio telephone systems and base stations
thereof, are receiver and transmitter antennas,
the condition of which influences the quality of connections.
A control of the condition of the antennas
can be carried out e.g. by measuring the SWR (Standing
Wave Ratio) of the antennas, i.e. electrical
matching of the antennas to the remaining part of the
receiver and transmitter system.By means of present methods, the measurement is
performed by supplying power through the antenna line 
to the receiver antenna and by measuring the power
reflected back from the antenna along the antenna
line by means of a broadband power meter. Due to the
broadband power meter, the power used for the measurement
must be high in order that the measurement
will not be sensitive to interference, which means
that signals received by the antenna do not disturb
the measurement. Using high power causes intermodulation
distortion in the receiver. These problems can
be avoided by using a duplex filter separating from
each other the measuring signal and the signals intended
to be received. However, the duplex filter
shall be installed before the receiver parts, which
weakens the sensitivity of the receiver, because the
filter causes losses in the antenna signal.A further solution is known, avoiding both
above-mentioned problems by using a measuring frequency
outside the receiver band and a narrow-band
power measurement adapted to this
