<ABSTRACT>
An improved surgical cutting block (10) for guiding bone saws in joint surgery and similar instruments is disclosed. The cutting block (10) is provided with one or more cutting guide surfaces (16) that may be positioned on exterior faces of the block (10) or along channels within the block. The cutting surface (16) of the material is composed of a material that has a Knoop hardness of 466 or greater (under a 500 gm load or greater), a chrome content of less than 10 % and a nickel content of less than 4 %. According to another aspect of the invention, a method of cutting bone tissue utilizing the improved surgical cutting device (10) whereby heat-generated damage to bone tissue is reduced and production of toxic residue is minimized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention relates to surgical
devices, and more particularly to surgical cutting
blocks used for guiding saws and similar cutting
devices in the shaping of bone, cartilage and other
medium to hard tissue.Sunderman et al. 1989. Journal of Orthopaedic
Research 7:307-315.Artificial joints, such as knee and hip socket
replacements, are frequently implanted in the body to
repair or replace damaged or diseased joints. In order
to achieve a successful implant, the bone adjacent to
the joint must first be cut and shaped in an
appropriate shape that is geometrically reciprocal to
the shape of the implant. Typically, the majority of
cutting is done with a saw blade attached to a
motorized surgical handpiece, which propels the blade
in a variety of directional or hi-directional motions.In most joint replacement surgery, the fit between
the bone surface and the replacement is very precise,
often with tolerances of a few thousandths of 25.4 millimetres (an inch).
Virtually all surgeons use a cutting block to force,
hold captive or guide a blade along a reference surface
along one or more sides of the cutting block. The
reference surface assures that the cutting plane will
be extended to and through the bone by helping to guide
the blade on its path through the bone. A typical cutting
block is described in US-A-4926847. Although widely used, known cutting blocks and
surgical methods based on the use of known cutting
blocks suffer from several serious problems. A
commonly encountered problem is systemic toxicity
following treatment. Standard surgical cutting blocks
are made from various grades of stainless steel that
are quickly eroded by the high speeds at which most
surgical blades operate. The result of such erosion is
the production of a slurry, commonly referred to in the
industry as "sludge," in and near the operation site.
The sludge contains the various elements present within
the alloy making up both the cutting block and the
surgical blades. A number of metals often found in
stainless steel alloys, including both nickel and
chrome, are left behind in the joint and eventually
make their way throughout the patient's body. Nickel
in particular is a known carcinogen. In a recent
study, Sunderman et al. (1989) report that nickel
concentrations in patients having joint replacement
surgery rose 11 fold in the 1-2 days following surgery
as compared to preoperative levels.Aside from the problem of toxic sludge, erosion of
stainless steel cutting blocks quickly cause the
fretting of the reference
