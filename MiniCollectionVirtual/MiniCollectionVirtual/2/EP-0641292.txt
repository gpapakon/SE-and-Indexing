<ABSTRACT>
A clarifier (10) with first stage flotation and second stage filtration divides at least the lower portion of a flotation tank (12) into independent cells (54). A branched conduit (78) collects clarified water. Valves (76) control the flow of clarified water to either a clarified water ring conduit (62) or to a first filtrate/bachwash ring conduit (64) connected to a storage tank (68). High cell walls (53) and inclined baffles (58) retain filter media during backwashing. A decompression valve (94) for pressurized water with dissolved air has a narrow annular slot set by a moveable member to create microscopic air bubbles. A mechanical or pneumatic actuator periodically opens the slot to flush trapped particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to an
apparatus and method for the clarification of water
where the removal of suspended particles is
accomplished by a flocculating agent and flotation
using a stream of rising, microscopic air bubbles.
More specifically, it relates to an improved
clarification apparatus and method of the general type
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,626,345 and 4,931,175
using flotation combined with filtration through a bed
of sand or the like at the bottom of the flotation
tank.Water clarification, the removal of
particulate contaminants suspended in water, is used
to treat waste water from manufacturing processes,
particularly in the paper and pulp industries, in the
treatment of municipal water drinking supplies, and in
sewage treatment. The water can be clarified by
sedimentation or flotation of the particles. Known
sedimentation techniques and apparatus are efficient,
but are limited even at peak efficiency to a
comparatively slow sedimentation rate, about 20·37 litres per minute per metre squared (Lpm/m2) (0.5
gallons per minute per square foot). To handle large
volumes of raw input water, sedimentation facilities
must therefore be large, with attendant cost and space
utilization disadvantages. Flotation techniques dissolve a few percent
of air by volume in pressurized water and then release
the air in the form of microscopic bubbles which
attach to the particles and carry them upwardly to the
surface where they form a floating sludge. The
particles are usually coagulated and flocculated using
conventional agents such as alum and polymers before
the air bubbles are introduced. Flotation techniques
are theoretically capable of achieving clarification
rates of 305·6 Lpm/m2 (7.5 gallons per minute per square foot) of
flotation area. Heretofore in practice the rates have
been less than this theoretical value, but
significantly better than for sedimentation techniques.Applicant holds several U.S. patents for
water clarification apparatus and processes, including
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,022,696; 4,377,485; 4,626,345;
4,184,967; and 4,931,175. In the '696 clarifier, sold
under the trade designations "SPC" and "Supracell",
the flotation occurs in a circular tank. The raw
water is fed into the tank via a central pipe, a
hydraulic joint, and an inlet pipe with multiple
outlets immersed in the tank which rotates about the
tank. The inlet flow is oriented opposite to the
direction of rotation of the inlet pipe and is at a
velocity with respect to the rotation rate such that
the raw water has a

A clarifier (10) has an inlet (48) for raw water with particulate
contaminants, a flotation tank (12) where the contaminants are flocculated

by a chemical agent added to the inlet water and floated to the surface of
the water in the flotation tank by microscopic air bubbles where they form

a floating layer of sludge, a layer of a filtration medium (56a,56b)
disposed at the bottom of the flotation tank (12) to filter the water before

it flows to a clarified water outlet (66), and means (16) for removing the
floated sludge from the tank and directing it to a sludge outlet (20),

comprising:

means (53) for dividing at least the lower portion of said flotation
