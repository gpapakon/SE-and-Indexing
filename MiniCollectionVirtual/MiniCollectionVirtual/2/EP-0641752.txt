<ABSTRACT>
Prodn. of plant fertiliser comprises comminuting fruit, including vegetable, fruit, esp. citrus fruits, peppers, apricots, peaches and nectarines, to a thick mash and adjusting the pH to 6.5-7.5 by admixing an additive. Pref., the fruit is conveniently crushed rather than cut or chopped, as this comminutes any seeds present. A hammer mill is esp. suitable for this purpose. The pH of the mash is suitably adjusted by adding chalk, which at the same time increases the dry content of the fertiliser. When a dry fertiliser is required, the water is removed by heating the mash, e.g. in a rotary heater.
