<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to wrapping apparatus of the kind
comprising a dispensing shuttle, from which a web of wrapping medium
is drawn, and which rides around an endless track and thereby orbits an
article, or part of an article, that is to be wrapped, especially to a wrapping
apparatus according to the features of precharacterizing part of claim 1. Such a
wrapping apparatus is known from AU-A-2 450 692.In some instances the track of such wrapping apparatus is linked
with an annular or similar article to be wrapped. In such instances, the
track necessarily comprises two parts that may be separated, to enable
the track to be linked with the article, and then re-united to enable
wrapping to proceed. One of the track parts may be hinged to the
other, but, for preference, the two parts of the track have been
separable bodily, to create two gaps in the track when they are
separated.In that an element of the present invention is the creation of a gap
in the track, it is particularly well adapted for application to wrapping
apparatus able to link with annular articles as aforesaid. An object of the present invention is to reduce the down time
inherent in the process of re-loading or re-threading a shuttle.The invention consists in a wrapping apparatus
according to the features of claim 1, especially
comprising a multi-part
endless track surrounding a wrapping station, a shuffle for
dispensing wrapping medium able to ride around the track and thereby
wrap an article in said station, a track support structure operable to
move, at least one part of the track relative to another part so as to open
and close at least one gap between those parts, a shuttle carrier
adapted, at least when said at least one gap is less than fully open, to
span said at least one gap as a continuation of the track thereacross,
carrier support means operable to insert and remove said carrier into
and from said at least one gap, and control means controlling the
operation of the track and carrier support means; whereby a
replacement shuttle may be inserted with the carrier and shunted from
the carrier onto the track and a used shuttle may be shunted from the
track onto the carrier and removed with the carrier. The invention further comprises a method of reloading a wrapping
apparatus of the kind comprising an endless track and a shuttle for
dispensing wrapping medium able to ride around said track, comprising
the steps of claim 18, especially of providing a loaded shuttle on a shuttle carrier, creating a
gap in said track, inserting said
