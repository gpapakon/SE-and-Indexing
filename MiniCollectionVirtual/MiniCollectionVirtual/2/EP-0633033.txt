<ABSTRACT>
A rectal administrator comprises a body having an 
administrative portion adapted to be inserted into a 

subject's rectum. A charge of medicament is 
disposed within the body, and the administrative 

portion has at least one passage through which the 
medicament can exit the body. A plunger is disposed 

in the body and is movable from a first position to 
a second position within the body to dispense the 

medicament from the body through the at least one 
passage. A releasable energy source is mounted 

within the body so as to be released in response to 
a predetermined actuating procedure. The releasable 

energy source moves the plunger from the first 
position to the second position to dispense the 

medicament from the body through the at least one 
passage when released in response to the 

predetermined actuating procedure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to 
automatic injectors, and more specifically to 
automatic injectors adapted for injecting a 
medicament into the rectum of a subject. While the rectal administrator of the 
present invention can be used to treat any type of 
physical ailment which can be treated by injecting a 
medicament into the rectum, the present invention is 
primarily concerned with the treatment of febrile 
seizures. Febrile convulsions are the most common 
type of seizure occuring in children. In fact, such 
seizures occur in about 2 to 4 percent of all 
children. In addition, approximately one third of 
those children who suffer a febrile seizure also 
have at least one relapse. Recent studies have shown the benefits of 
treating febrile convulsions with rectal diazepam 
(while other anti-convulsant drugs, such as 
phenobarbitone, valproate, and clonazepam have also 
been rectally administered to treat febrile 
convulsions, heretofore, diazepam has been the drug 
of choice). It can be appreciated that during an 
acute febrile seizure, it is extremely important for 
the diazepam to be administered as quickly as 
possible. Though febrile convulsions generally 
carry good prognosis, the attacks can lead to 
permanent neurological damage and even death. Abundant pharmacokinetic evidence suggests 
that rectal diazepam in solution may effectively 
treat both ongoing and acute seizures and be an 
advantageous alternative to iv. diazepam. Not only 
is rectal administration less painful and easier to  
 
administer, but it has been shown that absorption of 
diazepam is more rapid when administered rectally 
than when administered intravenously. With rectal 
administration of diazepam, presumed anticonvulsant 
levels are attained within minutes, especially in 
infants and small children. It can be appreciated, therefore, that a 
limiting factor in the effectiveness of rectal 
diazepam is the ease and speed by which it can be 
administered. Thus far, the typically available rectal 
administrator, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 
627,658, U.S. Patent No. 4,846,801, and U.S. Patent 
No. 1,775,329, has been manufactured for non-emergency 
treatment of hemorrhoids, fissures, 
ulcerations, eczema, and other pathological 
conditions of the anus and rectum. Such injectors 
include an outer sleeve-like body in which a 
medicament may be placed. The body has a drug 
delivery orifice at one end thereof and a plunger 
receiving portion at the other end thereof. An 
elongate plunger is fittable into the plunger 
rec
