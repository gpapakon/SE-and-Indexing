<DESCRIPTION>
The present application relates to novel pyrazole 
derivatives and phytopathogenic microbicides containing 
the derivatives as the active ingredients. Various microbicides have heretofore been 
developed but it is impossible to say that they are always 
satisfactory in view of their potency and microbes 
resistant to them. JP-A 1-125379, EP-459333A1, JP-A 3-141276 and WO-9208715A1 
have described that pyrazole derivatives of some 
kinds have microbicidal activity. (The term "JP-A" as 
used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent 
application".) However, the compounds described in the above-mentioned 
laid-open patent publications are not still 
satisfactory in view of their potency, their aftereffect, 
the damage to crops from them, etc. Therefore, the 
development of phytopathogenic microbicides which are more 
effective against plant diseases is desired.  We, the present inventors, considering these 
situations, assiduously investigated so as to develop 
compounds having excellent microbicidal activity and, as a 
result, have found that substituted pyrazole derivatives 
represented by the following general formula [1] have 
excellent microbicidal activity and have completed the 
present invention. Specifically, the present invention relates to 
substituted pyrazole derivatives of a general formula [1]: 
wherein 
R¹ represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an 
alkyl group, an alkoxy group, an alkylthio group, a 
haloalkyl group, a cyano group, an alkoxycarbonyl group, 
or an unsubstituted or substituted phenyl group;
 
R² represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, a haloalkyl 
group, an unsubstituted or substituted phenyl group, an  
 
unsubstituted or substituted phenylalkyl group, -COR⁶, or 
-SO₂R⁷;
 
X represents an oxygen atom, -S-, -SO-, -SO₂-, -N(R³)-, 
-CO-, or -C(R⁴)(R⁵)-;
 
Y represents an oxygen atom, -S-, -SO-, -SO₂-, or -N(R³)-;
 
R³ represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, a haloalkyl 
group, an alkenyl group, an alkynyl group, an alkoxyalkyl 
group, a cyanoalkyl group, an alkylcarbonylalkyl group, an 
alkoxycarbonylalkyl group, a nitroso group, an amino 
group, an unsubstituted or substituted phenylalkyl group, 
-COR⁶, or -SO₂R⁷;
 
R⁴ and R⁵ each independently represent a hydrogen atom, a 
halogen atom, an alkyl group, a haloalkyl group, an 
alkenyl group, an alkynyl group, or -OR⁸;
 
R⁸ represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, a haloalkyl

group, a cyanoalkyl group, an alkylcarbonylalkyl group, an 
alkoxyca
