<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the removal of compounds of the cresol family, substituted by nitro groups, existing in a mixture comprising aromatic nitro compounds; the said mixture being obtained by nitration of aromatic compounds by nitric acid, in the presence of sulphuric acid. The process according to the invention consists in bringing the abovementioned mixture into contact with, on the one hand, an oxidizing agent chosen from hydrogen peroxide, bleach or a mixture thereof and, on the other hand, a neutralising agent. The present invention makes it possible to reduce the amount of nitrocresols discharged in aqueous effluents.

A process for eliminating nitrocresol type compounds contained in a
mixture of nitroaromatic compounds other than trinitrotoluenes, said

nitroaromatic compounds being obtained by nitrating aromatic compounds
with nitric acid in the presence of sulphuric acid, characterized in that said

mixture is brought into contact with a oxidising agent selected from
hydrogen peroxide or Javel water, or a mixture thereof, and with a

compound which can transform the nitrocresols contained in the mixture
into hydrosoluble salts.
A process according to the preceding claim, characterized in that hydrogen
peroxide is used as the oxidising agent.
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the quantity of the compound which can transform nitrocresols into

hydrosoluble salts is such that the pH of the aqueous phase during contact
is in the range 1 to 9.
A process according any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
the compound which can transform nitrocresols into hydrosoluble salts is

an alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate.
A process according to the preceding claim, characterized in that an alkali
metal hydroxide is used.
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the mixture used originates from the reaction medium from said

nitration step which has been separated from the aqueous phase in a
decantation-separation step.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the
re
action mixture from said nitration step is used, which has preferably
been separated from the aqueous phase in a decantation-separation step,

then washed with water, then separated from the aqueous phase in a
decantation-separation step.
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the quantity of oxidising agent used is in the range 15 to 1000 moles,

more particularly in the range 15 to 500 moles per mole of nitrocresol type
compounds present in the mixture.
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the organic phase obtained after eliminating the nitrocresols is washed 

with water and then separated from the organic phase in a decantation-separation
step.
A process for preparing aromatic amines, characterized in that the process
of claim 9 is carried out and the organic phase obtained is dried if

necessary then brought into contact with pure or diluted hydrogen in the
presence of a hydrogenation catalyst.
