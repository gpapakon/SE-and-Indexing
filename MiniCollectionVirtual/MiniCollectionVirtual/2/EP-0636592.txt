<ABSTRACT>
In a method of processing sulphur-contaning 
residue and fly ash into cured granules, the residue is 

mixed with fly ash and water to make a mixture, the 
mixture is granulated and the granules are heated to 

effect curing. In the granulatable mixture, the amount 
of fly ash is not more than 20% by weight relative to 

the total amount of said fly ash and the residue. A 
cementless mortar is made from fly ash, by mixing fly 

ash with [chalk] 
lime
 and other components to form a 
mixture containing by weight 


(i) fly ash : maximum 85% 
(ii) optionally, an amount of sand not exceeding the 
amount of fly ash 
(iii) (chalk) 
lime
 : 6 - 12% 
(iv) other components : remainder, 
 
and maintaining the pH of the mixture in the range 

12.8 - 13.4. This mortar and the granules are combined 
to make a building block.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of processing 
sulphur-containing residues and fly ash into cured 
granules. Furthermore the invention relates to a 
method of making a cementless mortar from fly ash and 
to the manufacture of a building block comprising 
granules encapsulated in such mortar. The sulphur-containing 
residues are particularly those derived from 
combustion of coal, for example in flue gas 
desulphurization. It is known from US 4,344,796 to manufacture 
curable compositions based on the combustion residue 
originating from a fluidized bed kiln. In this 
publication it is proposed to mix this combustion 
residue with fly ash, whereby a curable composition or 
mortar is obtained. The mixture may then be brought 
into a desired shape and then cured. US 4,344,796 
identifies the problem that the residue from the 
fluidized bed kiln process is contaminated with 
compounds containing sulphur and seeks to create a 
product that can be used as road metalling material or 
otherwise. Another source of sulphur-containing residues  
 
is the cleaning of flue gas for example coal-burning 
plants by means of wet and dry flue gas 
desulphurization processes, which are well known. In 
this case, the residues contain sulphur compounds such 
as gypsum (CaSO₄.2H₂O and CaSO₃.1/2H₂O). It is known 
that there can be problems in the processing of such 
residues into stable granules. Because of the presence 
of sulphur in the residue, such granules manufactured 
and cured in accordance with the process of US 
4,344,796 have poor breaking strength and are even 
found to fall apart spontaneously. This is attributed 
to the formation of ettringite (3CaO.Al₂O₃.3CaSO₄.31H₂O). 
During the curing process ettringite forms mainly in 
the temperature range 35°C - 50°C. At higher 
temperatures, in the range 50°C - 90°C, the ettringite 
formed tends to decompose and calcium and aluminium are 
released for forming calcium aluminate hydrates. After 
curing ettringite forms under the influence of free CaO 
and Al₂O₃ present in the fly ash. The expansive 
ettringite causes the granules to crush easily and fall 
apart. EP-A-346992 describes a solution to this 
problem in which a coal ash which contains free CaO and 
CaSO₄ is mixed with fly ash which is free of CaO and 
CaSO₄, the mixture is heat treated and then granulated. 
After granulation, the granules are cured at 90°C in  
 
saturated water vapour for 16 hours. DE-A-3803409 describes mixing of fly ash and 
gypsum from combustion residue, to provide granules for 
inclusion
