<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part application 
of co-pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/405,138, 
filed September 11, 1989. The present invention relates to a biological method 
for controlling the growth of unwanted plants by treatment 
with both a chemical agent, such as a herbicide, and a 
bacterial plant pathogen. Widespread use of chemical herbicides has created 
concern about possible adverse ecological effects caused by 
large quantities of chemical agents that are being introduced 
into the environment. There are fears that these chemicals 
might pose risks to human and animal health. Special concern 
has been directed to health effects on agricultural workers, 
who may be exposed to high levels of chemical herbicides 
which may affect their health. In fact, it has been 
necessary to withdraw or severely restrict usage of some 
chemical herbicides from the market after adverse 
environmental or health effects became evident. Disposal of 
empty containers for chemical herbicides is heavily 
regulated, and the proper disposal of these containers can be 
inconvenient and expensive for farmers. Disposal sites for 
these containers are limited and illegal container disposal 
is a growing concern. There is a need, therefore, to find 
ways to decrease the quantity of chemicals that are used to 
control weeds and other unwanted vegetation. One strategy for reducing the amount of chemical 
herbicides introduced into the environment is to use 
biological microorganisms as bioherbicides to kill weeds or 
inhibit their growth. Since the large majority of the known 
plant pathogens are fungi, research and commercial  
 
application involving bioherbicides has focused on the use of 
such mycoherbicidal fungi. For example, U.S. Patent No. 
3,999,973 to Templeton teaches the use of Colletotrichum 
malvarum as a mycoherbicide for controlling prickly sida 
(Sida spinosa L.). U.S. Patent No. 4,606,751 to Van Dyke et 
al. describes the use of Bipolaris sorghicola as a 
mycoherbicide for controlling the growth of Johnsongrass 
(Sorghum haepense). U.S. Patent No. 4,636,386 to Anderson et 
al. discloses the use of a strain of Alternaria zinniae for 
use in controlling the growth of Italian thistle (Carduus 
pycnocephalus). Fusarium roseum Culmorum may be used for the 
mycoherbicidal control of Hydrilla verticillata (U.S. Patent 
No. 4,263,036 to Charudattan). For further discussion of the 
use of mycoherbicides, see R. Charudattan, "The Use of 
Natural and Genetically Altered Strains of Pathogens
