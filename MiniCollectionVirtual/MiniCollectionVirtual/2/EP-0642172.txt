<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a non-volatile memory with floating gate, in 
particular a Flash-EPROM, in which writing takes place through injection of hot 

electrons into the floating gate and in which erasing takes place through injection of hot 
holes. To keep the write and erase voltages sufficiently low, p-type zones which locally 

increase the background doping concentration of the p-type substrate are provided 
around the n-type source and drain zones. These p-type zones cause an increased field 

strength at the drain zone whereby hot electrons are formed at the pinch-off point also 
at lower voltages. This increased background concentration in addition reduces the 

breakdown voltage of the pn junction of the source and drain zones, so that hot holes 
for erasing can already be formed by pn breakdown at comparatively low voltages. The 

device is particularly suitable for being integrated into a signal processing IC 
manufactured in a standard process, such as a microcontroller.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device with a semiconductor
body which is provided at a surface with a non-volatile electrically erasable memory
comprising a number of memory elements with source and drain zones situated in a p-type
surface region of the semiconductor body, adjoining the surface, and mutually
separated by an interposed channel region, with a floating gate situated above the
channel region and insulated therefrom by an interposed gate dielectric, and with a
control gate insulated from the floating gate, information being written and erased
through injection of hot electrons and hot holes into the floating gate, while the hot
electrons are generated in the channel adjacent the drain zone through induction of a
channel current between the source zone and drain zone.Such a method is described, for example, in the earlier, not pre-published
European Patent Application No. 93202513.7, filed 04.10.93 by the same Applicant and
laid open on 13.04.94 under number 0 592 039. In this earlier Application a standard
CMOS process is described, supplemented with a few specific steps for optimizing the
embedded non-volatile memory without degradation of the logic portions of the
integrated circuit.Non-volatile memories with floating gates are known in the literature, for
example, under the abbreviations EPROM and EEPROM (Electrically Erasable
Programmable Read-Only Memory). An embodiment which is particularly popular at
the moment is known under the name Flash-EEPROM or Flash-EPROM, with which a
very high density can be obtained because each memory cell is formed by a single
floating-gate transistor. The selection transistors, which are necessary for each memory
element in an EEPROM of a usual type, are absent in the memory.From EP-A 0 218 342, a non-volatile memory is known, in which the
transistor selected for writing is brought into the "ON state" by means of a high voltage
applied to the control gate and the drain zone. Owing to the strong electric field near
the drain zone, high-energy (hot) electrons are formed in the channel current with
sufficient energy for flowing across the potential barrier of the gate dielectric to the 
floating gate, partly also under the influence of the electric field in the gate dielectric.
Erasing of the information takes place in the known device through injection of hot
holes which compensate the charge injected during writing.This method differs from the usual method of erasing whereby electrons
tunnel from the floating gate to a

A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device with a semiconductor body which is provided at a

from which the gate electrode of the field effect transistor and at least the floating gates of the

floating gates (8) of the memory elements are first formed from the silicon layer
through masked etching while the active region of the field effect transistor remains covered by the silicon layer

least substantially equal to the thickness and composition of the gate dielectric (7) in the
