<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionATOMICALLY POLARIZABLE ELECTRORHEOLOGICALMATERIALSTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to certain fluid materials which exhibit substantial increases in flow resistance when exposed to electric fields. More specifically, the present invention relates to broad temperature range electrorheological materials which undergo atomic polarization upon exposure to an alternating current electric field at high frequencies.Background ArtFluid compositions which undergo a change in apparent viscosity in the presence of an electrical field are commonly referred to as electrorheological fluids or materials. Electrorheological materials normally are comprised of particles dispersed within a carrier fluid and in the presence of an electrical field, the particles become polarized and are thereby organized into chains of particles within the fluid. The chains of particles act to increase the apparent viscosity or flow resistance of the overall fluid and in the absence of an electric field, the particles return to an unorganized or free state and the apparent viscosity or flow resistance of the overall material is correspondingly reduced.An electrorheological fluid composed of a non-conductive solid dispersed within an oleaginous fluid vehicle is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,047, 507. The compositions contain a minimum amount of water and a minimum amount of a surface active dispersing agent and the non-conductive solid consists of finely divided particles having an average diameter of from about 0.1 to about 5 microns.A method of inducing a change in dynamic torque transmission of an electrorheological fluid in response to an electric field at low current is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,879,056. The 

method involves selecting a non-conductive liquid phase and dispersing in the liquid phase an alumino silicate particulate phase which is substantially free of adsorbed water. The resulting electrorheological fluid is then subjected to an electric potential in excess of about 1 kV at a current density of less than about 1/3 microamp per square inch.U.S. Pat. No. 4,702,855 discloses electrorheological fluids consisting of an aluminum silicate solid dispersed within a fluid medium wherein the aluminum/silicate atomic ratio on the surface of the aluminum silicate is in the range of 0.15 to 0.80. The aluminum silicates may be either amorphous or crystalline and may contain contaminants such as Fβ2θ3, Tiθ2, CaO, MgO, Na2θ, and K2O. The electrorheological fluids may optionally contain an effective quantity
