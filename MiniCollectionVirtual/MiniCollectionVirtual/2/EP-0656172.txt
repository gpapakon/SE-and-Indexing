<ABSTRACT>
A forage harvester is provided with a cutterhead frame (34), mounted on a 
support (40) which can be pivoted about a cylindric beam (80) at the top 

thereof. The cutterhead frame (34) can be pivoted about the axis (39) of the 
cutterhea
d (36) under the action of hydraulic cylinders (90). Lower feedrolls 
(26,27) are installed in a lower feeder frame (24), attached to the 

cutterhead frame (34), and upper feedrolls (20,21) are installed in an upper 
feeder frame (18), which can be tilted forwardly about a cylindric beam (67) 

attached to the front of the lower feeder frame (24). Means (61,62) for the 
coupling of a crop collecting apparatus (10) also serve to support the upper 

feeder frame (18), when the latter is separated from the lower feeder frame 
(24). Other means (96,95) enable the attachment of the upper feeder frame 

(18) to a tractor (110). Thus can be gained access for inspection and 
servicing between the upper (20,21) and lower feedrolls (26,27) and to the 

cutterhead (36). The support (40) can be secured to the cutterhead frame (34) 
in order to raise both together and gain access between the cutterhead (34) 

and the blower rotor (49).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to forage
harvesters, and more particularly to the front unit thereof,
comprising upper and lower feeder means, operable to feed crop
material inbetween towards a rotating cutterhead, which is also
comprised by the front unit and which chops the incoming crop
material.A forage harvester usually is equipped with a detachable
crop collecting apparatus, such as a row crop attachment or a
pick-up device, which takes the crop off the field and feeds it
to the inlet of the front unit of the forage harvester. In order
to obtain good chopping quality, i.e. comminution of the crop
material to a constant chop length, an even mat of crop material
has to be fed at a constant speed towards the cutterhead to be
comminuted between the rotating knives of the cutterhead and a
stationary shearbar. The chopped material is led to a blower
unit with paddles, which throw it up into a discharge spout for
collection in a cart or container.In order to accomplish such constant flow, the crop
material is compressed between upper and lower feeder means
which have portions lying adjacent the shearbar. This compact
construction of the feeder means and the cutterhead hinders
access thereto for inspection, cleaning and service operations.Access to the shearbar and the cutterhead may be required
for inspection and adjustment of the shearbar to knife clearance
and for replacement of the shearbar or the cutterhead knives.Access for cleaning and service may equally be required
between the feeder means, which usually comprise sets of feeder
rolls. As to prevent damage of the cutterhead knives, the feeder
means may be equipped with a detector, which is operable to
immediately stop said feeder means upon detection of a foreign
object. Such detector usually is installed within the front roll
of the lower feeder means. Easy servicing and/or replacement of 
this detector is essential, because of the delicacy of its
electronic components. Therefore good accessability to said
front roll is required.The blower unit is mounted between the main frame of the
forage harvester and the front unit. Access for cleaning,
inspection and/or adjustment of the blower paddles involves
splitting between the front unit and the main frame. Currently
the whole front unit has to be removed for servicing of the
blower, which implies the use of additional hoist equipment such
as a tackle or a lift truck. Consequently such operation cannot
take place in the field.EP-A-0.300.299 discloses a front unit which comprises a
cutterhead
