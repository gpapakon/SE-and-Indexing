<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel benzopyran and other benzo-fused leukotriene 
B4 (LTB4) antagonists, to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds, 
and to a method of using such compounds as LTB4 antagonists. The compounds of this invention inhibit the action of LTB4 and are therefore 
useful in the treatment of LTB4 induced illnesses such as inflammatory disorders 
including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and 
other skin disorders such as eczema, erythma, pruritis and acne, stroke and other 
forms of reperfusion injury, graft rejection, autoimmune diseases, asthma and other 
conditions where marked neutrophil infiltration occurs. LTB4 antagonists are disclosed in European patent publications 276 064 and 
292 977 which refer to diphenylethers, benzophenones, and other compounds 
containing two phenyl groups, and 7-(3-alkoxy-4-alkanoyl-phenoxy)alkoxy benzopyran 
derivatives, respectively. According to the invention, it was found that the following compounds of formula 
I have LTB4 antagonistic properties: 
 
wherein 
A is O, CH2, S, NH, or N(C1-C6 alkyl); n is O, 1 or 2; R1 is a substituent at position b or c of the formula 
R2, R8, R9 and R10 are hydrogen or each independently are one or any two of 
the following: fluoro, chloro, C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy, C1-C4 perfluoroalkyl, C1-C4 
perfluoroalkoxy, C1-C6 alkylthio, C1-C6 alkylsulfinyl, or C1-C6 alkylsulfonyl; R3 is 
-(CH2)qCHR11R12, -(CH2)qR12, -O(CH2)pCHR11R12, or -(CH2)pR12, wherein p is 0, 1 or 2 
and q is 0, 1, 2, or 3; R4 is carboxy, tetrazolyl or R13SO2NHCO; R11 is hydrogen, C1-C6 
alkyl or R8 -substituted phenyl wherein R8 is as defined above; R12 and R13 are 
hydrogen or each independently are C1-C6 alkyl or C3-C8 cycloalkyl; or phenyl, thienyl, 
pyridyl, furyl, naphthyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, pyrimidinyl, or pyrazinyl, each of which is 
optionally substituted by phenyl, R9, or R9 -substituted phenyl wherein R9 is as defined 
above; and the salts and esters of those compounds of formula I containing a carboxy 
group, wherein the esters contain ester groups selected from the group consisting of 
C1-C6 alkyl, phenyl(C1-C6) alkyl, C3-C7 cycloalkyl, and phenyl and benzyl substituted by 
fluoro, chloro, C1-C6 alkyl or C1-C6 alkoxy. Preferred compounds of the invention are those of formula I wherein A is 
oxygen, those wherein n is 1, those wherein R1 is a substituent at position c, those 
wherein R2 is hydrogen or monofluoro, and those wherein R3 is benzyl, 4-fluorobenzyl, 
4-phenylbenzyl,
