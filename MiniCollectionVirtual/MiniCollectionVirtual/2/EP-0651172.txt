<ABSTRACT>
A mechanism for connecting and disconnecting, 
locking and unlocking, and holding members (18,26) to one 

another, and at the same time providing mechanical, 
electromagnetic shielding, electrical conductivity, 

and thermal dissipation, coupled with environmental 
sealing, is provided by a body (18) having a groove (38) therein 

and a coil spring (36) disposed therein. A housing (26), having 

an opening (48) sized to accommodate the body (18), is provided, 
and a tapered bottom (60) in the groove (38) prevents the spring (36) 

from turning past a vertical line, thus locking or 
connecting the body (18) with the housing (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to 
mechanisms for connecting and locking, connecting and 
unlocking, and connecting and holding two surfaces 
utilizing a canted-coil spring. More particularly, 
the surfaces may be rectilinear; and electromagnetic 
shielding, electrical conductivity, heat dissipation 
and environmental sealing may also be effected through 
the use of the present invention. Canted-coil springs suitable for the present 
invention and a description thereof, along with the 
loading characteristics of such springs, may be found 
in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,655,462; 4,826,144; 4,830,344; 
4,876,781; 4,893,795; 4,907,788; 4,915,366; 4,934,666; 
4,961,253; 4,964,204; 4,974,821; 5,072,070; 5,079,388; 
5,108,078; 5,117,066; 5,134,244; 5,160,122; 5,161,806; 
and 5,203,849. All of these patents have been issued 
to Peter J. Balsells. In addition, the hereinabove referenced issued 
patents describe, in general, electromagnetic 
shielding effectiveness of coil spring assemblies, 
particularly U.S. Patent Nos. 4,934,666; 
5,079,388; and 5,134,244. The present invention provides for a mechanism 
suitable for many mechanical and electrical applications. 
In particular, in electrical applications, the 
greatest suitability for the present invention  
 
combines environmental sealing with enhanced 
electrical conductivity. The use of an 
elastomer with a spring in intimate contact with 
surrounding coils achieves enhanced 
environmental sealing. The intimate contact between 
loaded points also inhibits foreign material, such as 
moisture, dust or oxidation that may be present, thus 
providing an effective environmental seal. A connect/disconnect, lock/unlock snap-on 
fastening and hold mechanism for mechanical, 
electromagnetic shielding, electrical conductivity and 
thermal dissipation, with further provision for 
environmental sealing, in accordance with the present 
invention, generally includes a body having a groove 
therein with generally parallel side walls. A coil 
spring is provided and disposed in the groove with a 
portion thereof protruding from the groove. Further, in accordance with the present invention, 
a housing is provided which has an opening sized 
to accommodate the body. Groove means, disposed on an 
inside surface of the opening, are provided for receiving 
the protruding spring portion and for enabling 
assembly of the body within the opening when the body 
and housing are moved in one horizontal direction with respect to 
another. This mechanism is known from EP-A-0 498 206.
