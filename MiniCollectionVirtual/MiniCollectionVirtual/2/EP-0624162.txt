<ABSTRACT>
Novel steroids having a 9 alpha -hydroxy or a 9 alpha -carbonate substituent can be prepared from 9 alpha -hydroxyandrostenedione and can be utilized in the synthesis of commercially valuable corticosteroids such as betamethasone. The 9 alpha -carbonates are prepared by reaction of the corresponding 9 alpha -hydroxy steroid with a sequence of excess base, trialkylsilyl chloride, alkyl haloformate and alkanol or by using excess base, alkyl haloformate and alkoxide. 9 alpha -Carbonate-17-keto compounds can be treated with lithium acetylide and a lithium salt to afford the corresponding 17 alpha -ethynyl-17 beta -hydroxy-9 alpha -carbonate. This compound is then esterified with a novel series of reagents to give the 17-ester which can be reduced the corresponding 17-allene. Oxidation of this allene to the bis-epoxide compound, followed by treatment with an alkali metal salt of a carboxylic acid under phase transfer conditions gives 17 alpha -hydroxy 21-ester 9 alpha -carbonate. Elimination of the 9 alpha -carbonate group affords the a 17 alpha -hydroxy, 9(11)ene, which in a few subsequent steps can be converted to a variety of commercially important corticosteroids. Novel 9 alpha -carbonate compounds are prepared in the various reaction steps.

<DESCRIPTION>
The 9α-hydroxy steroids are known to be useful
intermediates for preparing commercially valuable
corticosteroids. These corticosteroids such as
betamethasone find utility in the treatment of
psoriasis, dermatological diseases and inflammation.
U.S. Patent No. 4,127,596 describes a process for
dehydrating 9α-hydroxysteroid type compounds with a
strong acid (pKa less than 1) to give Δ9,11 steroids.
A a9,11 steroid is one which possesses a double bond
between positions 9 and 11 in the steroid ring.U.S. Patent No. 4,102,907 and European Patent

provide a process for preparing Δ9,11 steroids by
dehydration of 9α-oxygenated steroids possessing the
requisite 17,21-dihydroxy-20-ketone (corticoid) or 17-hydroxy-20-ketone
(pregnane) side chain which avoids D-ring
homo-rearrangement and which can also reduce the
steps required for their preparation. The present
invention utilizes a 9α-carbonate of the 9α-hydroxy
steroid as an intermediate in the synthesis of
commercially valuable steroids. 9α-carbonates are
prepared from the commercially available 9α-hydroxyandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione
or its derivatives by a
sequence of either excess base, trialkylsilyl halide,
alkyl, vinyl, or phenyl haloformate and alkanol; or a
sequence of excess base, excess alkylhaloformate and
alkoxide. The use of the 9α-carbonate allows for
elimination in the
