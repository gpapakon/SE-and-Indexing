<ABSTRACT>
A communication system includes channels for communication between subscribers defined by the combination of a selected CDMA code and a selected one or more time slots within a TDMA frame. The system may include a number of subscribers (2) connected via a common transmission medium to an access node (1). In this case the access node (1) is arranged to assign the channels to the subscribers during an access phase. The node (1) may communicate with the different subscribers on a common hailing channel. In one example, the hailing channel is defined by a pilot CDMA code common to the node (1) and to the subscribers (2). As well as allocating channels, the node (1) may select an appropriate data format and transmit indications to the subscribers of the data format selected.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CDMA/TDMA COMMUNICATION SYSTEMThe present invention relates to data communication systems and in particular to a novel access protocol for the transmission of data over a common channel. The invention is of relevance to all types of shared transmission media such as wire transmission lines or optical fibres but is particularly appropriate to digital radio networks.In communication networks using a shared channel, signal multiplexing is adopted to enable multiple subscribers to make use of the channel. Connections which may be used by subscribers are distributed along the common channel thereby allowing multiple access. An access protocol determines the conditions under which a given subscriber can transmit or receive data from the channel. This combination of multiple-access, signal multiplexing and the access protocol enables subscribers to communicate via their own "virtual physical link" which is set up during an initial access phase.As described in further detail below, hitherto two main techniques have been adopted for multiplexing data in multiple access systems. In "time division multiple access" or TDMA, data is transmitted in frames divided into a number of time slots of equal duration. Each data transmission from a given subscriber is allocated its own time slot within the time frame. The transmission from each subscriber therefore cannot be continuous, but is sampled and as many bits as can be fitted within the slot are transmitted in a given frame. The maximum number of different transmissions which can take place within a given time frame is set by the number of slots in the frame. TDMA systems therefore require a very rigid protocol.An alternative prior art technique is code division multiple access or CDMA. This relies on coding each data 

transmission with a unique pseudo-random code which is modulated on the data before the data is modulated onto the carrier. In the receiver, the data is recovered by correlating the code modulated data with a replica of the code used in the transmitter. Different virtual physical links can be accommodated by coding the relevant data transmission with different codes from the same basic family of codes. The code normally has a bit rate considerably higher than that of the data so that the transmission bandwidth of the modulated data is very much wider than that of the raw data. Such techniques are therefore referred to as direct-sequence spread-spectrum modulation.Conventional CDMA systems suffer a number of disadvantages. Unlike TDMA systems, each

 CLAIMS
1. A communication system characterised by subscriber channels defined by the combination of a selected direct sequence CDMA code and a selected one or more time slots within a TDMA frame.
2. A system according to claim 1, the system including a plurality of subscribers (2) connected via a common transmission medium to an access node (1) arranged to assign the channels to the subscribers during an access phase.
3. A system according to claim 2, in which the access node (l) is arranged to communicate with the different subscribers (2) on a common hailing channel assigned a direct sequence CDMA pilot code.
4. A communication system including an access node arranged to communicate with a plurality of subscribers characterised by subscriber channels defined by the combination of a CDMA code and a selected one or more time slots within a TDMA frame and in that the access node is arranged to communicate with the different subscribers on a common hailing channel defined by a pilot CDMA code common to the node and the subscribers.

6. A system according to claim 5, in which the node (1) is arranged to communicate in addition data indicating a selected data format for the transmissions between the subscribers, the said data indicating whether the channel includes single or multiple time slots within each frame, and where multiple time slots are used whether those slots are contiguous or time disjoint. 7. A system according to claim 6, in which the node (1) is arranged to adapt the data format when the channel includes a plurality of contiguous time slots by replacing 


redundant header or trailer bits in the second or subsequent slots with traffic data.
8. A method of operating a communication system characterised by allocating to subscribers channels defined by the combination of a selected direct sequence CDMA code and a selected one or more time slots within a TDMA frame.
