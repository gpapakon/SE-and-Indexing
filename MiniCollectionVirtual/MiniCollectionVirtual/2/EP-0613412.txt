<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a continuous process for recovering polymer particles from a solution of polymer by evaporating the solvent from the solution by successively treating the solution into a first agitated vessel (3) and treating the resulting polymer into a second agitated vessel. Furthermore, the invention relates to an apparatus (3, 5, 14, 15, 22) for performing the aforesaid process for recovering polymer particles. The apparatus includes a first agitated vessel (3), second agitated vessel and a quick-acting discharge valve (22) at the outlet of the second agitated vessel. The first and second vessels have rotating blades (5, 15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for forming polymer particles
from a solution of
butadiene-styrene rubbery
polymer by evaporating the solvent from the solution
and an apparatus for carrying out the process.Many prior art methods are known for the recovery of a polymer from its
solution; however, there are many disadvantages to these methods such as
inefficient use of energy, safety and health hazards, use of inert gas
and mechanical problems.US Patent 3,450,183 to Robert A. Hinton discloses a method for drying a
polymer where the polymer solution is flashed below the melting point of
the polymer to obtain an essentially dry or solid flash residue. The
problem is that the method is only operable with those polymers that will
flash to form an essentially dry solid, whereas if the polymer solution
upon flashing retains enough solvent to be a sticky mass, the equipment
will become all fouled up. A rubbery polymer solution is one example
wherein after several stages of flash the rubber solution reaches a
viscous stage which still is not dry, yet it cannot be pumped or handled
otherwise either.Another method is disclosed in US Patent 3,251,428 where a slurry of
polyolefin is sprayed into a fluidised bed of polyolefin particles. The
slurry coats the particles, then the hot vaporous solvent used to
fluidise the bed vaporises any solvent remaining in the coating.
Problems arise, however, when the polymer bed becomes too sticky to
fluidise. Safety hazards are increased due to the use of the hydrocarbon
as a fluidising medium. The system, as well, is generally inefficient
energy-wise. Patent Abstracts of Japan vol.8, no. 246 (C-251) discloses the
introduction of a viscous styrene polymer into the first deaerator of a
cylinder which is provided with a heating mechanism such as steam jacket
and an agitation mechanism with a plurality of rotating shafts having at
least 2 stirring blades and treated under conditions of 150-300°C and
10-600 Torr until the content of the unreacting substance becomes 0.1-50
wt%, the resultant polymer introduced into the second deaerator of an
upright cylinder equipped with a heating means by shear action and a
stirring means for thin film evaporation to effect stirring treatment at
200-300°C under a pressure of less than 50 Torr until the content of the
unreacting substances and solvents becomes less than 1wt%.EP Patent 2271 to William R. King discloses a process where the polymer
solution is introduced into a maintained bed of mechanically agitated
polymer particles. This
