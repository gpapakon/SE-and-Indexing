<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (10) for the destruction of sharps having shafts (64) of fusible conductive material retained in a retaining body, the apparatus comprising a pair of spaced electrodes (12, 14) arranged to be connected to a power supply, characterised in that the electrodes are disposed such that at least one of the electrodes (12) is pivotally movable relative to the other electrode (14) so as to allow a portion of a shaft (64a) of fusible conductive material to be placed between the electrodes (12, 14) to complete an electrical circuit so as to allow the portion to be destroyed and to allow successive portions of the shaft to be placed between the electrodes until all of the shaft is destroyed and the retaining body abuts the electrodes so as to cause at least one electrode to pivot towards the other electrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method 
for the destruction of sharps such as hypodermic needles or 
blood lances. Hypodermic needles and lances are used for the injection 
and extraction of fluids from organisms. Because of 
difficulties associated with sterilization for subsequent 
reuse of needles, it is generally preferred that sharps are 
only used once before being discarded. Used sharps may 
contain or have been in close contact with highly 
infectious bacteria and viruses or other substances 
considered harmful. Further, the presence of fluids 
extracted from organisms on sharps can provide material for 
the growth and multiplication of other harmful agents which 
could potentially be transmitted to those handling the 
sharps, particularly if the sharps are re-used or where the 
sharp accidentally punctures the skin. It is thus desirable to ensure that sharps cannot be 
re-used and that an effective means of sterilising sharps 
is employed. Devices which destroy hypodermic syringes by shearing the 
needle have been proposed to prevent the re-use of the 
needle. Whilst these devices are certainly effective in 
preventing a second use of the needle they have no 
sterilizing effect and any infectious or harmful material 
remains on the sharp. Moreover, those handling the sharp  
 
are still exposed to the possibility of accidental injury 
through the sharp puncturing the skin. Devices which destroy the sharp by electric current have 
also been proposed (WO-A-9219291). Sharps generally have a high surface 
area and a relatively low volume. Resistance to the 
passage of high current will thus cause heating of the 
sharp. A sufficiently high current will cause the sharp to 
fuse thereby destroying the sharp. Devices which operate on the electrical resistance 
principle have to overcome a number of difficulties. In 
particular, problems have been encountered in destroying 
the needle completely without leaving a remnant stub 
attached to the needle. Attempts to avoid this problem 
have generally involved various configurations of 
electrodes which permit a needle to be inserted 
therebetween to destroy the needle. During the destruction 
process the remaining portion of the needle becomes 
successively shorter and more difficult to destroy. Electrodes are generally shaped so as to have the smallest 
possible gap therebetween which allows short portions of 
needle to be destroyed. However, this approach to the 
problem of needle destruction is not without difficulties. Firstly, by

An apparatus for the destruction of sharps (10) having 
shafts (64) of fusible conductive material retained in a 

retaining body (66), the apparatus comprising a pair of spaced 
electrodes (12, 14) arranged to be connected to a power supply (16), 

characterised in that the electrodes are disposed such that 
at least one of the electrodes (12) is pivotally movable 

relative to the other electrode (14) so as to allow a portion of 
a shaft (64) of fusible conductive material to be placed between 

the electrodes to complete an electrical circuit so as to 
allow the portion to be destroyed and to allow successive 

portions of the shaft to be placed between the electrodes 
until all of the shaft is destroyed and the retaining body 

abuts the electrodes so as to cause at least one electrode 
to pivot towards the other electrode. 
An apparatus for the destruction of sharps according to 
claim 1, characterised in that at least one electrode (12) is 

resiliently biased into position. 
An apparatus for the destruction of sharps according to 
claim 1, characterised in that each electrode has an inner 

face (22, 24) adjacent the other electrode inclined such that a gap 
between the electrodes becomes less towards lower edges of 

the electrodes. 
An apparatus for the destruction of sharps according to 
claim 1, characterised in that the or each pivotally 

movable electrode may be moved around the pivot (20) by pressure 
brought to bear on the electrode by the retaining body such 

that the electrodes are urged together and a gap between 
the electrodes is reduced allowing portions of the shaft  

 
close to the retaining body to be destroyed. 
An apparatus for the destruction of sharps according to 
claim 4, characterised in that following the destruction of 

a sharp when the pressure is removed from the or each 
pivotally moveable electrode the electrode is biassed into 

position so as to allow debris to fall through a channel (26) 
between the electrodes. 
An apparatus for the destruction of sharps according to 
claim 1, characterised in that the apparatus has a 

plurality of deflection means (38, 40) located below the electrodes 
to guide any debris. 
An apparatus for the destruction of sharps according to 
claim 1, characterised in that the apparatus further 

comprises a means (76) for reducing the effect of sparks and 
smoke generated during the use of the apparatus. 
An apparatus for the destruction of sharps according to 
claim 1, characterised in that the relative positions of 

the electrodes is adjustable.
