<ABSTRACT>
Described herein is photographic processing 
apparatus which includes a vessel (13) in which a tank 

(12) and rack (11) are located, the tank (12) and rack 
(11) defining a space (10) through which photographic 

material (21) to be processed passes. Processing 
solution is recirculated from an outlet (6) from the 

tank (12) via a pump (17), manifold (20), filter (25) 
and heat exchanger (26) and back to tank (12). A 

replenishing system (245, 246, 248, 255, 259) is 
provided which operates automatically to introduce 

fresh processing solution into the recirculating 
processing solution in the manifold (20). The system 

(245, 246, 248, 255, 259) comprises a pump (246) driven 
by a motor/motor driver arrangement (255, 259) which is 

connected between a reservoir (245) of replenishing 
solution and a metering vessel (248).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to photographic
processing apparatus and is more particularly concerned
with automatic replenishment, calibration and metering
systems for use with such apparatus.The processing of photosensitive material
involves a series of steps such as developing,
bleaching, fixing, washing, and drying. These steps
lend themselves to mechanization by conveying a
continuous web of film or cut sheets of film or
photographic paper sequentially through a series of
stations or tanks, each one containing a different
processing liquid appropriate to the process step at
that station.There are various sizes of photographic film
processing apparatus, i.e., large photofinishing
apparatus and microlabs. A large photofinishing
apparatus utilizes tanks which contain approximately
100 liters of each processing solution. A small
photofinishing apparatus or microlab utilizes tanks
which may contain less than 10 liters of processing
solution.The chemicals contained in the processing
solution: cost money to purchase; change in activity;
and are seasoned by the constituents of the
photosensitive material which leach out during the
photographic process; and after the chemicals are used
the chemicals must be disposed of in an environmentally
safe manner. Thus, it is important in all sizes of
photofinishing apparatus to reduce the volume of
processing solution.The prior art suggests various types of
replenishing systems which add or subtract specific
chemicals to the processing solution to maintain a 
consistency of photographic characteristics in the
material developed. Photosensitive material processing
equipment typically consists of several large volume
tanks of processing solution that the exposed
photosensitive material is driven or towed through to
produce an image, as the photosensitive material is
processed the strength of the processing solutions is
diminished and will eventually become exhausted. To
prevent the continual weakening of the processing
solution additional fresh processing solution is added
to the tank solution at a rate equivalent to the rate
of use and rate of carry out of the processing
solution. The above maintains processing solution
activity and volume. Typically the replenishment is very
small compared to the working processing tank volume.
A typical ratio of replenishment per square foot of
photosensitive material for a large volume tank would
be 0.00025 to 0.00075 of the tank volume. Since the
above ratio is small the effect of pulsing delivery and
cyclic variation of the
