Press tool (1) particularly for connecting tubular work
pieces (22), having compression jaws (4, 10, 11) which are

movable relative to each other so that they can be opened to be
applied to the work piece (22) and that they complement each

other at the compression end to form a closed compression
space, and also having a drive arrangement for movement of

compression jaws (10, 11) in the direction of compression, one
(4) of the compression jaws (4, 10, 11) being constructed as an

abutment which can be applied to the work piece (22) and is
arranged on a yoke that is situated at the free end of the

press tool (1) and is swivellably carried at one side and at
the other side is releasable or lockable, characterised in that

more than two compression jaws (4, 10, 11) are present, two
compression jaws (10, 11) being displaceably guided upon guide

surfaces (8, 9) disposed in V-formation to each other such that
in the compression process they always move in the direction of

the centre point of the compression space.
Press tool according to claim 1, characterised in that the
compression jaws (4, 10, 11) are movably guided relatively to

each other such that their respective neighbouring opposed end
surfaces are evenly spaced apart when compression begins.
Press tool according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the compression jaws (4, 10, 11) are formed of equal length in

the peripheral direction.
Press tool according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that the directions of movement of the two movable

compression jaws (10, 11) enclose an angle of 60Â° which is
disposed symmetrically with respect to the central

perpendicular of the abutment (4) and opens away from it.
Press tool according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that the movable compression jaws (10, 11) bear, on the one

hand against guide arrangements (8, 9) determined by their
directions of movement (C, D), and bear on the other hand 

against a pressure ram (18) which is movable in the direction
of the abutment and is connected with the drive arrangement(s)

and in which the compression jaws (10, 11) adjoining the
abutment (4) are displaceably mounted.
Press tool according to claim 5, characterised in that
between the compression jaws (10, 11) that are displaceable

relatively to the pressure ram (18), a further pressure jaw is
applied or connected to it, disposed opposite to the

abutment (4).
Press tool according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised
in that each movable compression jaw is provided with its own

drive arrangement.
Press tool according to one of claims 1 to 4 or 7,
characterised in that the drive arrangements are formed as

pressure or tension rams effective in the respective movement
arrangements.
