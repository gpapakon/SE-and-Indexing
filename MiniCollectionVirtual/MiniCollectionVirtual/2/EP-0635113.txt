<ABSTRACT>
In a steam generating process for a forced flow-through boiler, in particular a Benson boiler, water runs through at least one pre-heater (5), an evaporator (3, 4) and if required an overheater (2) during operation of the boiler. In the starting phase and if required in low load states, a water-steam mixture runs through a separation flask (14), from which steam is removed and the separated supply water is fed to the preheater (5). In order to indicate an excessive water discharge in a forced flow-through boiler operated with waste heat, the evaporator is subdivided into at least two sections (3, 4), of which one (3) receives water and is included in the water circulation at the beginning of the starting phase and the other (4) gradually receives water in a controlled manner from a dry state until water successively runs through both evaporator sections in the operating state.
