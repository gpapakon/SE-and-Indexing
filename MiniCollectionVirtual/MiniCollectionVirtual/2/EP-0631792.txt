<ABSTRACT>
A low-profile steerable dilatation catheter (10) for 
angioplasty procedures which has an inflated balloon (16) on the 

distal end with little or no tendency to wrap on itself when 
the catheter is advanced through a patient's vascular system. 

The catheter comprises an elongated tubular member (11) which is 
longitudinally relatively flexible but diametrically 

relatively rigid, a guide extension (12) secured to the distal end 
of the elongated tubular member, and an inflatable balloon 

secured on the proximal end thereof to the distal end of the 
elongated tubular member and on the distal end directly or 

indirectly to the guide member or the tubular member and an 
elongated flexible member such as a helical coil (21) secured to 

the guide extension distally of the balloon. The elongated 
tubular member is preferably a hypotube of stainless steel or 

nitinol.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to vascular catheters 
and particularly low-profile steerable catheters for 
angioplasty procedures, such as percutaneous transluminal 
coronary angioplasty (PTCA). In PTCA procedures, a dilatation 
catheter having an inflated balloon on the distal end thereof 
is advanced through a patient's arterial system until the 
deflated balloon crosses the atherosclerotic lesion to be 
dilated. The balloon is inflated to a predetermined size with 
radiopaque liquid at relatively high pressures to compress the 
atherosclerotic plaque against the inside of the artery wall 
and then the balloon is deflated so that the catheter can be 
removed and blood flow resumed. Typically, a guiding catheter having a preformed distal 
end is first percutaneously introduced into the patient's 
arterial system with the distal tip in the coronary artery. 
A guidewire is advanced through the guiding catheter into the 
patient's coronary anatomy until the distal end of the 
guidewire crosses the lesion to be dilated. The dilatation 
catheter is then advanced over the guidewire, with the 
guidewire slidably disposed within an inner lumen of the 
catheter, until the inflatable balloon is positioned within 
the lesion. For a more detailed description of angioplasty 
procedures and the devices used in such procedures, reference 
is made to U. S. Patent 4,332,254 (Lundquist); U. S. Patent 
4,323,071 (Simpson-Robert); U. S. Patent 4,439,185 
(Lundquist); U. S. Patent 4,468,224 (Enzmann et al.) U. S. 
Patent 4,516,972 (Samson); U. S. Patent 4,538,622 (Samson et 
al.); and U. S. Patent 4,616,652 (Simpson) which are hereby 
incorporated herein in their entirety.  Steerable dilatation catheters with built-in guidewires 
or guiding elements are being used with greater frequency 
because the deflated profile of such catheters are generally 
smaller than conventional dilatation catheters having the same 
inflated balloon size. Further details of low-profile 
steerable dilatation catheters may be found in U. S. Patent 
4,582,181 (Samson) which is hereby incorporated in its 
entirety by reference thereto. The lower profile of these 
catheters allows the catheter to cross tighter lesions and to 
be advanced much deeper into the patient's coronary anatomy. 
Moreover, the use of steerable low-profile dilatation 
catheters having a built-in guidewire or guiding element 
shortens considerably the time for the angioplasty procedures 
because there is no need to first insert a guidewire and then 
insert a conventional
