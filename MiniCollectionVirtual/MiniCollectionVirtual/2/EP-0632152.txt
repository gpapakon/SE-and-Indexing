<ABSTRACT>
A thick belt consisting of a narrow woven material having thickness and breaking strength with 
respect to a predetermined width thereof that are out of the conventional range of common sense of 

those skilled in the art. A thick belt (1) in which the woven texture consists of not less than 
four layers, two outer layers (2, 3) being woven tubularly of common weft threads (41), the inner layers (5, 6) which 

are other than these two outer layers being woven of another weft thread (42), characterized in that the thickness at an 
almost middle portion of the width thereof is not less than 1/4 of the width of the belt.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thick belt, particularly
to a thick high-strength belt used, in place of a rope, as
a safety belt or for a sling for a flexible container.A safety belt generally comprises a metal member
attached to one end of a rope and a hook attached to the
other end thereof. In a sling for a flexible container,
a rope is connected to a metal member attached to a
container body. Usually the connection of the rope with
the metal member is carried out manually by a process in
which a rope end is untwisted to a group of strands which
are then fixedly incorporated into the rope body. Since
this process requires skill as well as considerable
strength, it is difficult to obtain operators therefor
nowadays. If a narrow width woven fabric is used in
place of a rope, the connection may be easily carried out
through a sewing operation, but the handling thereof is
inferior to a rope due to its width.In a woven fabric used for a sling requiring a high
strength, it is necessary to weave a number of warps into
a predetermined width of the fabric, whereby the fabric
must be three layerd, or two layered while adding a
plurality of reinforcing core yarns. An inspection of
eight slings available in the market showed that the
average thickness was 4.17 mm and the maximum thickness
was 5.2 mm (nylon). An estimate was obtained, from the
investigation of these weave structures, that the average
breakage strength is 7820 Kgf and the maximum is
10680 Kgf (polyester) if a strength utilization ratio is
assumed to be 80%. As there is a limit in the number of
warp which can be woven into a predetermined width, it is
necessary to weave fabrics with unwillingly widening its 
width, so that the strength requirement is fulfilled. Of
course, specially high-strength yarns, such as aramide
fiber yarns, may be used for this requirement, but these
are so expensive that they cannot be used for general
purposes.The limitation of the warp numbers which can be
woven into a predetermined width of a narrow width
fabric, is mainly determined by the capacity of the loom
on which the fabric is produced. It is the above-mentioned
slings that are designed and produced within
such the strict limitation of the number of warps and
thus these fabrics were produced under an extremely
uppermost verge of the limitation of the conventional
art. The limitations of loom will be described below.In a needle-type narrow loom, a weft is picked into
a warp shed from one side thereof, and received by a
latch needle positioned on the other side

<CLAIMS>
A thick belt (1) comprising a core region and at least
four layers (2, 3, 5, 6) of weave structure including two

outer layers (2, 3) and at least two remaining inner
layers (5, 6), said two outer layers (2, 3) being woven

into a hollow tube by respective warps (61, 71) and a
common weft (41) and said at least two remaining inner

layers (5, 6) being woven by respective warps (51, 52) and
a second common weft (42), wherein said core region is

formed by core yarns (7) and said core yarns (7) being
arranged only an area formed within the most inner side

hollow fabric layer (6) of said layers or being arranged
in an area formed within the most inner side hollow fabric

layer (6) of said layers and in an area formed between two
layers thereof adjacently arranged to each other, the belt

having a width and a weaving structure and the weaving
structure providing a portion having a rope-like cross

sectional shape in a central area and the thickness of
said belt being greater than one quarter of the belt

width.
A thick belt (1) as defined by the above mentioned
claim 1, which comprises a basic portion (10) consisting

of a thick belt construction having a rope-like cross
sectional shape and a wider section (11) having a cross

sectional shape corresponding to a flat section thinner
and wider relative to said basic portion (10) and arranged

lengthwise thereof, said basic portion (10) and said wider
section (11) being of different woven structures, said

basic portion (10) having a thickness larger than that of
said wider section (11) and a width smaller than that of

said wider section (11).
