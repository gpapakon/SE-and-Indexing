<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and equipment for quantitatively dosing small amounts of liquid, especially in clinical or other similar wet-chemical analyzers. The dosing employs a liquid space (1) the volume of which can be changed and which is connected to a dosing channel (5) so that, by increasing or decreasing the volume of the liquid space, a suction or an injection through the dosing channel is achieved. According to the invention the liquid space (1) is formed by flexible bellows (2) which are freely movable back and forth to provide the reversible deformations which change the volume of the liquid space. The movements are effected using an actuator (3) which is connected to the bellows (2) without transmissions containing sliding surfaces, the actuator comprising precisely repeatable positions and which is calibrated according to the invention by measuring the sizes of the dosages produced by the movements between the positions. The dosing is effected after that by selectively repeating said calibrated movements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of this invention is a method for dosing small
amounts of liquid in a quantitative way by using a liquid space
the volume of which is changeable and which is connected to a
dosing channel so that suction or spraying is achieved through
the dosing channel by increasing or decreasing the volume of the
liquid space.In wet-chemical analyzers used for clinical purposes or the
like, the dosing of liquid is typically carried out by measuring
a few micro liters of a sample and a few tens of micro liters of
a reagent and by adding a diluting agent so that the total
volume of the dosed item of liquid is about 100-1000 Âµl. A
liquid space, the volume of which is changeable, is used in the
dosing, the liquid space being formed by a ground glass cylinder
provided with a plunger sealed with teflon, and which
communicates with the dosing tip through the channel, the liquid
being able to be injected from the tip to a vessel such as a
small rinsing basin.The movement of the plunger in the cylinder, on which the dosing
of the liquid is based, is generally provided by a stepper motor
which rotates, through a reduction gear and through a cogged
belt, a slot-headed screw, the piston rod being suspended on the
nut on the slot-headed screw through a transversal arm. The
maximum length of the movement of the plunger can be about 60mm
which requires 3000-6000 steps of the stepper motor. The
precision of the dosage with such a number of steps can be in
the order of 0.5-1% from the total volume of the cylinder and
the repeatability 0.02-0.05% from the total volume, i.e., about
1-3 steps of the stepper motor. However, if only 1% of the
volume of the cylinder is used for dosing, the repeatability of
the dosage is in the order of about 1.5% from said volume.The above values indicate that the present dosing techniques
cannot provide very good dosing precision and that the precision 
and the repeatability further depend very much on the magnitude
of the dosage relative to the total volume of the cylinder. One
of the reasons for this is the fluctuation of the friction
between the plunger and the cylinder which leads to inaccurate
starting-up and stopping of the plunger. Another considerable
reason for the inaccuracy is the multi-phase transmission chain
between the stepper motor and the plunger, the sum of the
tolerances of the transmission chain being high and the
repeatability of movements low because of this. In addition, the
mutual differences of the steps of the stepper motor, which are
nominally of the same length, are
