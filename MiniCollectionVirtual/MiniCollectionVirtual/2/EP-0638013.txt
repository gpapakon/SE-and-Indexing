<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic breaking hammer (10) has a machine housing (11) in which a percussion motor (15) which includes a reciprocatingly movable percussion piston (17) delivers impacts to a breaking tool (13) in the front of the machine housing (11). The machine housing (11) is carried by a surrounding carrier support (18) via intermediate walls (24, 25, 26). The carrier support has the form of a shell (18) which is attached at the rear adjacent connecting devices (19), to a carrier, such as a hydraulic digging machine which aligns the machine housing (11) while the manner (10) is at work. The machine housing (11) is constructed without joints in its axial direction along the length of the housing and includes a guide passage (21) in which a percussion motor (15) is carried, this percussion motor having the form of an insert cartridge which can be clamped from the rear. The shell (18), the intermediate walls (24, 25, 26) and the machine housing (11) are all combined in a single one-piece metal casting and the space between the shell (18) and the machine housing (11) is filled with a sound-damping material which adheres to the housing (11) and surrounding parts. Hydraulic fluid communication with the percussion motor cartridge (15) is effected through annular grooves (44', 45', 46') provided in the guide passage (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic breaking 
hammer comprising a machine housing in which a percussion 
motor includes a cylindrical part and a percussion 
or impact piston which moves reciprocatingly in the 
cylinder part and strikes against a breaking tool which 
is supported in a tool carrying portion at the front of 
the machine housing, said machine housing being supported 
inwardly of a surrounding carrier support device 
which is attached to connecting means which functions to 
bring the hammer mechanically into alignment during its 
work. Breaking hammers of the type concerned are normally 
fitted to hydraulically operated excavating machines, or 
diggers, of different sizes, the hydraulic systems of 
which are switched so as to also drive the hammer, said 
hammer being connected to the outer end of the jib or 
boom of the digger through the medium of connecting 
devices, and said boom functioning to guide the hammer 
during a working operation. 
The machine housing of the breaking hammer is typically 
comprised of separate cylinder parts, which surround the 
percussion piston, the seals and the valve system, and 
are grouped axially adjacent one another within the 
carrier support and held tightly together by strong side 
bolts, with the intention of obtaining a reliable seal 
between the cylinder parts against the high internal 
hydraulic working pressures that occur. The carrier 
support is normally comprised of metal plates held 
together by transverse bolts, or of casings between or 
in which the side-bolted cylinder parts are secured in 
some suitable fashion. The breaking hammer obtains a 
complicated machine housing construction in both instances, 
although the carrier support is required as a  
 
necessary outer protective means, since the hammer is 
handled harshly and may be subjected to repeated impacts 
against the work object. Examples of machine housings of 
the aforesaid configurations are described in Patent 
Publications U.S.A. 3,866,690 and 4,552,227. The complicated breaking hammer construction has a 
negative influence on machine safety. Wear and corrosion 
together with micro-movements in the joints as a result 
of impacts and vibrations occurring as the hammer is 
used results in gradual penetration of working oil into 
the joints and their seals, which can result in oil 
leakages with subsequent danger to the surroundings and 
also in the risk of damage to the machine. The side 
bolts are also liable to fracture, with serious consequences. In recent times,

<CLAIMS>
A hydraulic breaking hammer (10) comprising a machine 
housing (11), in which a percussion motor (15) 

includes a cylinder part (12) and a percussion piston 
(17) which is reciprocatingly movable in the cylinder 

part (12) and which delivers blows to a breaking tool 
(13) supported in a tool-receiving portion (16) at the 

front of the housing (11), wherein the housing (11) is 
carried by a surrounding carrier support (18) which is 

attached to a connector means (19) for guiding the 
hammer (10) mechanically during its work, 
characterized
 
in that the machine housing (11) is undivided 

in its axial direction and interiourly in a guide 
passage (21) of the housing, without the support of side 

bolts, carries the cylinder part (12) of the percussion 
motor (15) fixed axially in said guide passage (21) 

between an inner abutment (29) adjacent the tool-receiving 
portion (16) of the housing and a cover member 

(30) attached to the rear end of the housing; in that 
the machine housing (11) merges with the carrier support 

(18) via stiffening intermediate walls (24, 25); and in 
that the carrier support (18), the intermediate walls 

(24, 25) and the machine housing (11) are incorporated 
in a single one-piece metal structure. 
A breaking hammer according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the space between the carrier 

support (18) and the machine housing (11) is filled with
