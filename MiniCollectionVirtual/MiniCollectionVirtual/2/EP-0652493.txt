<ABSTRACT>
A developing device (8) incorporating a developer supply
unit (20) and a developer discharge section, in which a supply

developer including a mixture of toner and carrier is
successively supplied to a developer container (16) from the

developer supply unit (20) and a deteriorated developer in the
developer container is discharged through the developer

discharge section. The developer supply unit (20) has a sponge
member (21b) for selectively attracting toner to a surface

thereof, a magnet member (21a) for selectively attracting
carrier to a surface thereof, and a member for scraping

and bringing the toner and carrier (D) attracted to these
members (21a,21b) into the developer container (16). The developer

including toner and carrier in a predetermined ratio is
thus stably supplied to the developer container (16). In

another example of the developer supply unit, agitating of
the developer is performed while shovelling the developer

deposited in a lower part of the unit by a transport
screw. With this structure, since the toner and carrier

are evenly mixed in the unit, the developer having a
uniform toner concentration is supplied to the developer

container, thereby continuing satisfactory development.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a developing device
which stores a two-component developer including toner and
carrier, and supplies the toner to the surface of a
photoreceptor in an electrophotographic apparatus such as
a copying machine so as to develop an electrostatic latent
image formed on the photoreceptor surface into a visible
form.For example, a developing device which develops an
electrostatic latent image on a photoreceptor surface into
a visible form using a two-component developer including
carrier and toner is often used in dry-type copying 
machines. In such a developing device, the toner is
consumed during a developing operation, while the carrier
is not consumed and remains in the developing device.
Consequently, the carrier deteriorates as the carrier and
the toner in the developing device are frequently
agitated. Then, a resin coat layer on the surface of the
carrier is removed and the toner adheres to the surface
thereof. As a result, the charging performance of the
developer is gradually degraded. US 4,003,335 A discloses a developing material applicator for use in a photo-electrostatic
copying machine, comprising a housing structure having two
compartments divided by a partition wall. A first one of the compartments
serves as a powder tank for accommodating finely divided toner particles while
a second one of the compartments serves as a chamber for accommodating
magnetizable carrier beads. A developing material employed in association with
said applicator consists of a mixture of said carrier beads and said toner particles.Within the first compartment. there is provided a magnetic roll having a consecutive
portion of the outer periphery thereof situated within the second compartment
through an opening. During rotation of the magnetic roll, said carrier
beads are magnetically attracted to the magnetic roll and standing on the
outer peripheral surface of said roll as magnetic brush bristles which contact
toner particles under friction, and electrostatically attract the toner. particles.
A clipping roll having a plurality of clipping blades is rotatably positioned
within the second compartment in the vicinity of the magnetic roll such that
the magnetic bristles formed by the carrier beads and the toner particles on
the outer peripheral surface of the magnetic roll are transferred to the second
compartment by means of said clipping blades.Patent Abstracts of Japan, JP 01172879 A, discloses a developing device comprising
a developer container and a hopper arranged above said developer
