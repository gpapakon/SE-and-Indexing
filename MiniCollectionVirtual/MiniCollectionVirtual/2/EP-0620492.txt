<ABSTRACT>
In conventional photographic processes, 
material being processed follows a predetermined 

sequence of steps, for example, developer, bleach, 
first wash, fixer, second wash, and stabilizer. This 

requires the provision of at least two wash tanks as 
the film is traditionally processed by following a 

fixed path through the processor. This makes the 
processor bulky as the wash tanks need to be repeated. 

Described herein is a process in which more than one 
wash step can be accommodated using a single wash 

tank.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic
processes for processing photographic material and is
more particularly concerned with the use a particular
processing stage more than once.In conventional photographic processing
apparatus for processing of photographic material, the
material being processed follows a predetermined
sequence of steps through the apparatus. For example,
when processing a conventional colour negative film
using the C-41 process, the film follows these
processing steps: developer, bleach, first wash,
fixer, second wash, and stabilizer.In conventional processing apparatus, this
requires the provision of at least two wash tanks as
the film is traditionally processed by following a
fixed path through the processor. The use of wash
water between processing steps as discussed above is
described in GB-A-1 493 170 and DE-A-34 23 671.Prewashing baths are also known in the art.
For example, JP-A-62 38465 discloses the use of a
prewash bath between the developing step and the wash
step, and JP-A-63 143548 discloses the use of a
preliminary wash tank between the fixing step and the
wash step.It is also known in the art to have more
than one washing step and the water from a later wash
step is recovered for use in an earlier wash step.
This is discussed in JP-A-62 38465 mentioned above,
and also in GB-A-2 062 265 and EP-A-0 512 321.However, in the apparatus used to carry out
the processes discussed above, more than one wash tank
is always provided. US-A-4 575 209 discloses a method for
automatically processing film discs in which a
transport system moves the discs through successive
processing stations. Two stations exist for a single
tank containing a bleaching solution and also for a
single tank containing a fixing solution. Single
stations are associated with respective tanks
containing developing solution and stabilizing
solution, and with two separate washing liquids. The
discs are moved sequentially through the successive
tanks.With the advent of minilabs and the need to
make processing apparatus smaller, it was found that
the first wash step could be removed from the C-41
process for processing of colour negative film as
discussed above. This made the process quicker and
the apparatus shorter as one less wash tank is
required.However, there are several disadvantages
associated with the removal of this first wash step:-
1) The fixer solution becomes contaminated
with bleach. In particular, bromide is carried in
from the bleach which makes the fixing step slower.
Iron complexes also carried

<CLAIMS>
A method of processing photographic
material, which comprises two or more processing steps

that are carried out in appropriate tanks, each tank

containing a different processing solution through
which the material is passed, characterised in that

the photographic material is passed from one tank into
a different tank which it had previously visited.
A method according to claim 1, wherein
the previously visited tank is a wash tank for

carrying out a wash step.
A method according to claim 2, wherein
the photographic material is passed through the wash

tank at least two, and preferably at least three,
times.
A method according to any one of the
preceding claims, comprising at least three

processing steps.
A method according to any one of the
preceding claims, wherein the processing steps

comprise passing the photographic material through
tanks containing (a) developer solution, (b) bleach

solution, (c) fixing solution, and (d)
wash solution.
A method according to any one of the
preceding claims, wherein the steps are carried out

automatically.
