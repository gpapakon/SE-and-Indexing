<ABSTRACT>
A computer controlled video re-editing system with a "Domino" 
re-edit function. An edited video comprises a set of ordered video segments. 

In a video re-editing system a user can re-edit an edited video by adjusting the 
duration of each video segment. When a user adjusts the length of a video 

segment, the Domino re-edit function examines how the re-edit to the edited 
video work affects nearby video segments in the edited video work. The 

Domino re-edit function then propagates the effects of a re-edit by moving the 
nearby video segments forward or backward along a time line to 

accommodate the re-edit made. The Domino re-edit function utilizes any 
empty spaces that exist in an edited video work such that the empty spaces are 

filled before the effects of a re-edit are propagated to another video segment. 
If there is sufficient empty space between video segments, the effects of the re-edit 

cease propagating. To prevent a video segment from being moved by the 
Domino re-edit function, a user can "lock" the video segment to a reference 

time line. To preserve a relative relationship between two video segments, a 
user can lock the two video segments together.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus and methods for
editing video and audio information, and more particularly, the present
invention relates to a computer controlled re-editing system which fills in
gaps in a media time line when a re-edit is made.Video editing combines video source material from a number
of different video sources into a single video work. After the editing process,
an edited video work comprises an ordered collection of video blocks from
the different video sources. Each video block comprises an "in" point which
marks where the video block begins and an or "out" point which designates
where the video block ends.Edited video works are then usually "re-edited" to further
refine the edited video work. During the re-editing process the existing
collection of video blocks may be moved around. Furthermore, the in and
out points of each video block may be moved forward (ascending in time) or
backward (descending in time). Keeping track of and adjusting all the in and
out points of the video blocks during the re-edit process is a computationally
intensive task. Consequently, computer controlled video re-editing systems
have been developed. The computer controlled video re-editing system 
manages the task of adjusting the in and out points which
define the video blocks as a user re-edits an edited video
work.One problem associated with existing computer controlled
video re-editing systems is that the re-editing systems only
adjust the video block in and out points after re-edits in
one of two simple ways. The existing re-editing systems
either affect only the single video block being re-edited or
propagate the effects of the re-edit to every subsequent
video block. Such all or nothing re-edit systems lack the
flexibility needed for today's heavily edited video
productions. As will be described, the present invention
provides a method and apparatus for re-editing video such
that a re-edit to a video block only affects the nearby video
blocks as necessary to accommodate the re-edit.EP-A-0,390,048 discloses an apparatus for assisting in
editing of multi-media works which displays separate
reference time lines for pictures, text and audio. It is therefore an aim of the present invention to provide a
computer controlled re-edit system with more flexible re-edit operations.
Specifically, the present invention implements a "Domino" re-edit function
that adjusts only the nearby video blocks as necessary to accommodate a re-edit.The Domino re-edit function of the present invention first
examines

gaps between said media blocks on said reference time line,

characterised in that said method comprises the steps of:

when a first media block is extended in a first direction
such that the duration of said first media block is

increased, and said extended first media block overlaps

a second media block located next to said first media
block in said first direction;
moving said second media block along said reference time
line in said first direction such that said second media

block is adjacent to said first media block and said
second media block no longer overlaps said first media

block; and
moving additional media blocks next to said second media
block along said reference time line in said first

direction after filling in said gaps between said media
blocks such that a duration of gaps filled equals the

increase in duration of said first media and no media
blocks overlap.
The method of re-editing a multi-media work as claimed in
