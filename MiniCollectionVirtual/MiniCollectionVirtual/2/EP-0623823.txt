<ABSTRACT>
It is well-known to use evaporation caps in 
an incubator of an analyzer to prevent evaporation of 

patient sample retained on a test element therein. 
These caps work well when the test element bearing a 

patient sample is inserted into the incubator in a 
particular direction. However, if the orientation of 

the test element is changed for whatever reason, the 
patient sample may be disturbed by the evaporation cap. 

Described herein is an improved evaporation cap (80, 
81, 82, 84, 92, 94, 96, 97) which allows a test element 

to be inserted into the incubator in any orientation. 
The cap comprises a body portion (81) having opposite 

ends (82, 84) with a sealing surface (97) located 
between the ends. Legs (92, 94, 96) depend from each 

end of the cap and extend through a support on which 
the caps and covered test elements rest. A camming 

track mechanism is provided underneath the support 
which cooperates with the legs (92, 94, 96) to raise 

and lower both sides of the cap simultaneously to avoid 
any significant sideways thrust on the cap or on a test 

element underneath.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to incubators used in clinical
analyzers, and especially to the evaporation caps used
therein and the mechanism for raising and lowering them.Evaporation caps are known for incubator stations on
a rotor. Examples are disclosed, for example, in EP-A-0 377
505 and in US-A-4 963 333. In EP-A-0 377 505 an arrangement
is described which raises and lowers evaporation caps by
having a camming mechanism provided above each cap. In US-A-4
963 333 the caps so disclosed feature camming feet at
two of four corners of the cap, and two pivot feet at the
other two corners. A recess is provided in the under
surfaces to accommodate two upwardly projecting liquid drops
on a potentiometric slide element. The cap works by
pivoting on its two pivot feed due to the camming feet
riding up onto an incoming slide, thus clearing the cap
under surface from contact with the upwardly projecting
drops.Such a cap works well when the location of the
upwardly projecting drops is adjacent the trailing edge of
the slide element, such as is the case on the analyzer
available from Eastman Kodak Company under the trademark
"Ektachem 250", hereinafter the "E-250". It does not work
so well, however, if the slide element is turned 180° so
that the upwardly projecting drops are adjacent the leading
edge of an incoming slide element. The latter occurs when
using a slide distributor such as is found in the analyzer
disclosed in US-A-4 298 571. Distributors are particularly
useful when using more than one incubator, for example, as
in the "Ektachem 700"™ analyzer also available from Eastman
Kodak Company. That distributor receives the slide in the
orientation mentioned for the "E-250", and then turns it
180° for insertion into an incubator. Such a distributor is
not used on the E-250. The reason why the 180° reversal of
the slide renders the described cap less useful is that the
resulting nearness of the projecting drops to the pivot edge
of 
the cap necessitates a larger size of the camming feet
which is impractical.However, because a single incubator cannot be
made indefinitely large, then such a distributor allows
for a higher throughput, using plural incubators, than
when it is not used. It would be advantageous to
provide a cap which cams upwardly by some mechanism as
the potentiometric slide enters with the upwardly-projecting
drops adjacent the leading edge. Such
camming has to be done with some care, since the
upwardly-projecting drops should not be jarred
sideways, that is, along the axis connecting them, lest
the

support means (30) for supporting a slide test element (E) in the
incubator, the support means (30) including a plurality of stations (32) for supporting

the test elements (E);
first moving means (40, 42) for moving the support (30) about an axis
(38);

support means (30) and located over a slide element (E) positioned thereon, the cap (80)

having opposite ends (82, 84), and a sealing surface (97) between the ends (82, 84) to
seal a slide element (E) against evaporation; and
second moving means (100), disposed under the support means (30), for
moving the cap (80) up and down relative to the support means (30);
characterized in that
the evaporation cap has at least one leg (92; 94, 96) depending from each
end (82, 84) of the cap, the legs (92; 94, 96) extending through the support means (30)

into contact with the second moving means (100);
and in that second moving means (100) comprises a camming track (104,
106, 108, 110, 112) underneath the support means (30) for each of at least two different
