<ABSTRACT>
A process for alleviating bleed and improving 
color in printed elements comprises applying an anionic 

printing liquid and a cationic printing liquid to a 
substrate adjacent to one another, wherein at least one 

of the printing liquids contains a polymer and reacting 
the anionic and cationic printing liquids with one 

another; wherein the color integrity of the anionic and 
cationic printing liquids is maintained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of making 
printed elements 
having 
reduced color bleed and improved color. There are many methods of making printed elements 
in which printing liquids are applied to a substrate to 
form an image. The term "printing liquid," as it is 
commonly understood in the art, means a colorant in a 
liquid media, as distinguished from solid and dry 
colorants, and includes paint, toners, inks, etc. The 
liquid media may be an organic solvent ("solvent 
based") or water ("aqueous based"). The colorant may 
be a dye or a pigment. Other ingredients typically are 
present in the printing liquid, depending upon the 
particular printing technique being employed. Exemplary methods of using printing liquids 
include gravure and press printing, xerographic 
techniques using liquid toners, and ink jet printing, 
to name but a few. Of these methods, ink jet printing 
has become increasingly popular, particularly for so-called 
"desk-top publishing" applications, because of 
its ability to make multi-color prints by introducing 
three or four primary inks on a substrate in a single 
pass. Other printing methods generally require at 
least one pass through the printer for each primary 
color.  
 Despite the breadth of techniques available for 
making printed elements, a common problem can arise 
when a multi-colored element is desired in which a 
printing liquid of one color is placed in abutting 
relationship to a printing liquid of another color. 
This problem is manifested in a mixing or "bleeding" of 
the two printing liquids at their interface, whereby 
the line of demarcation between the two printing 
liquids is obscured. Bleeding may cause undesired 
color formation at the interface and a concurrent loss 
of resolution, color separation, edge acuity and color 
purity in the image. The more contrasting the two 
adjacent liquids are in color (such as black and 
yellow), the more visual the bleed. Bleed is also 
particularly noticeable when the mixing of two inks 
produces a secondary color, such as when blue and 
yellow mix to produce green. Bleed is a particular problem in ink jet printing 
because the relatively low viscosity inks used therein 
tend to spread and because ink jet printers have the 
capability of printing three or four primary colors in 
simultaneous (or near simultaneous) fashion. Several methods have been proposed to prevent 
bleed of adjacent printing liquids. The most obvious 
method is to apply the two printing liquids at a 
distance from one another such that no
