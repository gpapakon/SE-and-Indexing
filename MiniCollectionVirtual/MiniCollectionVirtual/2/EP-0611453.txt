Method for the separation of an end section 
(6) of an optical waveguide fibre (2), where the fibre 

(2) in the separating region is stabilized against 
evading movements during the separating procedure, 

characterized in that the end section (6) is separated 
by a particle stream (21) directed towards the fibre 

(2) in the separating region. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in 
that 


an end region (1) of the fibre (2) is guided 
through a bore (3) of an end part (4) until the 

end section (6) comes out of the bore (3), 
the fibre (2) is glued in the bore (3), 
the end section (6) is wetted with adhesive (20) 
before the separating procedure at least at its 

region near the end part and 
the end section (6) is separated in front of the 
end part (4). 
Method according to claim 2, characterized in 
that before the insertion of the fibre (2), on the 

insertion side a quantity of adhesive (7) is introduced 
which is sufficient for gluing the fibre (2) in the 

bore (3) and for wetting the region of the end section 
(6) which is near the end part. 
Method according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the particle stream (21) 

is formed at least in part from corundum powder. 
Method according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that a particle size in the 

region of 10 µm to 100 µm, preferably of 25 µm to 
50 pm, is selected. 
Method according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the particle stream 

pressure is adjusted to about 5 bar (5,10
5
 Pa). 
Method according to one of the preceding  
 

claims, characterized in that the particle stream 
diameter is adjusted to about 0.5 mm. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the particle stream (31) is 

directed towards the fibre (2) at an angle of at most 
20° to the longitudinal axis of the fibre (20). 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the particle stream (21) is 

directed towards the fibre (2) approximately at right 
angles to the longitudinal axis of the fibre (20).
