<ABSTRACT>
Prior art devices for coating continuous strips of paper or cardboard (1) exist which have a counter-roller round which the paper or cardboard (1) passes, an application system (3) which applies an excess of coating material to the paper or cardboard (1), and a metering system (4) disposed a certain distance downstream from the application system (3) and fitted with a doctor blade. The application system (3) includes an application roller (8), driven to rotate, with a smooth surface which, together with the counter-roller (2), forms an application gap (9) to which excess coating material is fed in the same direction as the direction of motion of the paper or cardboard. The invention calls for the application roller (8) to have a diameter of 5 to 200 mm, preferably 10 to 150 mm, and to form together with the counter-roller (2) an application gap (9) of 0.01 to 2 mm, preferably 0.05 to 1 mm, these figures being in addition to the thickness of the paper or cardboard, and the rear side of the application roller (8) i.e. that remote from the counter-roller (2), rests, over the whole working width of the roller, against a mounting (12, 26, 27) which is rigid in the direction radial to the counter-roller (2) to prevent bending.

Device for coating a paper or board web (1), 
having 


a mating roll (2) deflecting the web (1), 
an applicator system (3) which applies coating 
material in excess to the web (1), and 
a metering system (4) with a doctor element (5), 
which is arranged at a distance downstream of the 

applicator system (3) in the web running direction, 
 
the applicator system (3) containing an applicator 

roll (8) which has a smooth outer surface and can be 
rotated by means of a drive, the said roll (8) forming 

with the mating roll (2) an applicator gap (9) to which 
coating material is fed in excess from the web inlet 

side, characterized in that the applicator roll (8) 

has a diameter of 5 mm to 200 mm, preferably 10 mm 
to 150 mm, 
forms with the mating roll (2) an applicator 
gap (9) of 0.01 mm to 2 mm, preferably 0.05 mm to 

1 mm, in addition to the paper or board thickness, 
and 
on its rear side facing away from the mating 
roll (2) is supported against bending over the 

entire working width by a holder (12, 26, 27) which 
is rigid radially towards the mating roll (2) and is 

immovable in the working position. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the applicator roll (8) is mounted in a bed (10, 11) 

which extends over the working width, is open towards the 
mating roll (2), is produced from a material which is  

 
similar to rubber and is of limited elasticity and is 

fitted into the holder (12). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the restoring force of the system of applicator 

roll (8) - bed (10, 11) - holder (12) against a 
deflection in the radial direction away from the mating 

roll (2) is at least 1 * 10
6
 N * x * y, preferably more 
than 5 * 10
6
N * x * y; where x = axial length of the 
applicator roll (in [m]
) and y = radial deflection away 
from the mating roll (2) (in [m]
). 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 

that the restoring force of the system of applicator 
roll (8) - bed (10, 11) - holder (12) is less than 

2 x 10
7
 N * x * y [sic], preferably less than 

1 * 10
7
 * N * x * y [sic], where x = axial length of the 

applicator roll (in [m]) and y = radial deflection away 

from the mating roll (2) (in [m]). 
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 4, characterized 
in that the bed (10, 11) surrounds the applicator 

roll (8) on its outer circumference over a range of at 
least 180Â°. 
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 5, characterized 
in that the bed (10, 11) contains one or more 

ducts (16) which are open towards the applicator roll (8) 
and run parallel to the axis of the applicator roll (8). 
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 6, characterized 
in that at least one inner wall of the bed 

(10, 11), bearing on the applicator roll (8), is designed 
as a lip extending in the axial direction. 
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 7, characterized 
in that the bed consists of two parts (10, 11) 

which are mounted so that they can be moved towards each 
other and away from each other for the purposes of 

holding and removing the applicator roll (8) in the 
holder (12). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that, on the inlet side of the applicator roll 

(8), there is arranged a sheet metal guide (18) which 
extends as far as into the vicinity of the applicator  

 
gap, forms with the inlet-side flank of the holder (12) 

or with the circumference of the roll (8) a feed duct 
(17) which extends at an acute angle to the tangent to 

the mating roll (2), and whose rear side, facing away 
from the applicator roll (8), is designed as a discharge 

surface for excess coating material. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that, on the inlet side of the applicator roll 

(8), there is arranged a feed duct (17) which extends as 
far as into the vicinity of the applicator gap (9) and is 

connected to a colour chamber (19) having a feed (20) for 
coating material, there being arranged in the colour 

chamber (19) a sheet metal guide (22) which extends over 
the working width and radially towards the mating roll 

(2), ends at a distance from the bottom of the colour 
chamber (19) and, with the outlet-side wall of the colour 

chamber (19), forms a duct (23) having a slit-like entry 
opening which opens into the feed duct (17). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that, on the inlet side upstream of the 

applicator roll (8) there is arranged a doctor blade (24) 
which extends over the entire web width and bears with 

its tip on the web (1).
