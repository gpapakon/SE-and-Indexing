<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to capacitance measuring
devices, generally, and in particular to devices for
measuring the capacitance in a material-sensing probe.There are a variety of uses of capacitance
measuring devices. One use in particular relates to
detection of material levels (such as, for example, fluid in
a tank). In these applications, a capacitance measuring
probe is disposed in a material-containing vessel. The
vessel and the probe are at different potentials so as to
form a capacitor therebetween. The air and material
contained in the vessel act as dielectrics. As the material
level changes, so does the capacitance between the probe and
the vessel.Capacitance is normally measured using one of the
following parameters: (a) differential impedance or
admittance; (b) phase difference; or (c) frequency (or time),
based on capacitive reactance.The differential impedance technique is based on
the generalized impedance formula: 
Z=R2 + (XL-XC)2
To use this technique, two parallel systems are established,
each having identical drive frequency, drive amplitude,
resistance and inductance. One system includes a reference
capacitor of known value. The other system contains the
capacitor which is to be measured. Thus, the only difference
between the systems is capacitance. The output of the system
with the known reference capacitor is compared to the output
of the system with the unknown capacitance to determine a
voltage or current differential. In accordance with Ohm's
Law (v = iZ), the voltage (or current) differential is
proportional to the values of capacitance.One drawback to this system is that exact control
and matching of inductances is difficult. Therefore, systems
based on this principle, while very rugged, tend to have
moderate overall accuracies (i.e., an error of approximately
between one and three percent).The phase difference technique is based on the
capacitive reactance formula:
Xc=1-jÏ‰C
To use this technique, two parallel systems are established,
each with identical drive frequency and drive phase. One
system includes a reference capacitor of known value. The
other system contains the capacitor which is to be measured.
Thus, the only difference between the systems is capacitance.
The different capacitance causes the system's outputs to have
different phase angles. The difference of phase angles is
theoretically proportional to the values of capacitance.
Unfortunately, a phase system with a linear relationship
between capacitance and phase angle can be realized only with
difficulty, and
