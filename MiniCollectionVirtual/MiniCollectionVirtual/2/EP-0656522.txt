<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cartridge case, in particular for firing in small arms, having a base percussion cap chamber (4), which is designed as a cylindrical recess and into whose top at least one detonating channel (11) opens, having a percussion cap which is introduced into the percussion cap chamber (4) (such that it is flush) and has a capsule (6) which is in the form of a pan and consists of a capsule base and a cylindrical side wall, and having a detonating charge (2) and anvil (8) which are arranged in the interior of the capsule (6). In order to improve the gas sealing in the direction in which the weapon is fired, particularly in the case of detonating charges which are free of hazardous materials, it is proposed that the percussion cap chamber (4) be provided in the region of the side wall of the capsule (6) with an expanded region (9), which is circumferential in an annular shape, so that the anvil (8) has space to move outwards after detonation of the detonating charge (2) and expansion of the capsule (6).

<CLAIMS>
Cartridge case, in particular for firing in
small arms, having an inside bottom (4) shaped as a

cylindrical recess in its base, in the upper side of
which inside bottom at least one detonating channel

(11) opens, having an ignition cup which is inserted in
the inside bottom (4) in a flush manner and has a cup-shaped

casing (6) which consists of a casing base and a
cylindrical side wall, and having an ignition charge

(2) arranged in the interior of the casing (6) and an
anvil (8), characterized in that the inside bottom (4)

is provided with an annular extension (9) in the region
of the side wall of the casing (6), so that, after

ignition of the ignition charge (2) and expansion of
the casing (6), the anvil (8) has room to yield, and in

that, between the extension (9) and the upper side of
the inside bottom (4), is arranged a stop (10) for the

end of the cylindrical side wall of the casing (6).
Cartridge case according to claim 1,
characterized in that the extension (9) is arranged in

the area adjoining the upper side of the inside bottom
(4).
Cartridge case according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the extension (9) is wedge-shaped

in cross section and the greatest depth of the
extension is provided in the area adjoining the upper

side of the inside bottom (4).
Cartridge case according to one of claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the extension (9) extends over

almost half the length of the side wall of the casing
(6).
