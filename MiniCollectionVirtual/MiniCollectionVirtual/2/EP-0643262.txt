<ABSTRACT>
According to the process, enabling the production of NOx to be reduced, at least one fuel gas stream, at least one oxygen-containing combustion gas stream and at least one stream (10) of one of the said gases in liquid form are ejected via a burner (1). In an oxyburner a proportion (between 15 and 35 %) of the oxygen is ejected in liquid form. In an air-burner with natural gas a proportion (10 to 30 %) of the latter is ejected in the form of a coherent liquid jet. Application especially to glass furnaces and to boilers.

<CLAIMS>
Combustion process comprising stages of ejecting, via a 
burner (1), at least one flow of combustible gas and at least 

one flow of oxygenated combustion assisting gas, characterized 
in that it comprises a stage of ejecting at least part of one 

of the said gas flows in liquid form (10). 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
combustion assisting gas is air, the gas ejected in liquid and 

gaseous forms being a gas containing methane. 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
ratio between the mass throughput rates of the gas flows 

injected in liquid and gaseous form is between 10 and 45 %. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
combustion assisting gas is oxygen which is ejected in liquid 

and gaseous forms. 
Process according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
combustible gas is a gas containing methane. 
Process according to claim 4 or claim 5, characterized in 
that the ratio between the mass throughput rates of the gas 

flows injected in liquid and gaseous forms is between 18 and 
55 %. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that at least part of the liquefied gas flow 

is injected centrally (10) into the end of the burner (1). 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the burner (1) is fitted to a boiler.  

 
Process according to one of claims 1 and 4 to 6, 
characterized in that the burner (1) is fitted to a metal 

melting furnace. 
Process according to one of claims 1 and 4 to 6, 
characterized in that the burner (1) is fitted to a glass 

furnace.
