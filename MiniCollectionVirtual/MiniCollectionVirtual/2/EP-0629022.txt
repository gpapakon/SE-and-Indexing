<ABSTRACT>
A cell with terminals and a circuit substrate 
are disclosed. An arrangement of terminal elements 2 and 

3 which are mounted respectively on terminal surfaces of 
the cell 1 mounted on a plain-plate like terminal element 

of a mating equipment is provided with a pair of 

engaging-portion spaces 
C
 which are formed respectively 
by forward end portions 2b and 3b in which peripheral 

ends are worked in bending into a circle so as to form 
openings A1 in one surface, and projections 2a and 3a 

which partially project inwardly in the other surface, 
and uses metallic material in which a wall thickness is 

within a range of 0.15 - 1.0 mm, a Vickers hardness is 
250 - 450 HV, and a spring limit value is 30 - 60 

kgf/mm².

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cell assembly having 
terminals by which a cell can be detachably mounted to a 
circuit substrate and to a circuit substrate having 
terminals for detachably mounting a cell. Generally, a primary or a secondary cell such as a 
lithium or an alkali cell or the like shaped like a coin, a 
button or a cylinder is frequently used as a backup power 
source for memories in electronic instruments or the like. 
Terminals are mounted on the cell by resistance welding, 
laser welding (YAG laser, exima laser or CO2 laser) or the 
like and the cell is directly mounted on a circuit 
substrate by soldering the terminals thereto. Thus, an 
operation for changing the cell at a service time or at the 
time the guaranteed life of the cell service life ends is 
difficult. Further, it is desirable to recycle a cell 
which uses various kinds of metallic oxides and rare metals 
such as lithium, zinc and the like. For this reason, as 
disclosed in the Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 
60-131753 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 3-40464, a 
cell holder has been employed in which a cell can easily be 
retrieved. Where the cell is mounted on the cell holder, a space 
for receiving the cell holder on a circuit substrate is 
required. In view of recent miniaturisation or electronic 
devices, it is difficult to provide a space for receiving 
the cell holder on the circuit substrate. The present invention intends to solve the above-discussed 
problems, and an object of the invention is to 
provide a cell with terminals which allow easy exchange of  
 
the cell and in which a fixing strength of the cell is 
excellent, or alternatively, to provide a circuit 
substrate. Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention 
provides a cell assembly comprising: a cell with terminal 
surfaces; and a pair of terminal elements attached to the 
terminal surfaces of the cell; characterised in that each 
of said terminal elements comprises an engaging portion for 
receiving one of a pair of mating terminal elements of a 
device to which the cell assembly is to be attached; and 
that said engaging portion of each of said terminal 
elements comprises peripheral ends which are bent to form 
an interior region and a first surface with an opening, and 
a second surface with a projection projecting partially 
into the interior region from the second surface. A second aspect of the present invention provides a 
circuit assembly comprising: a circuit substrate; and a 
pair of terminal elements mounted on the
