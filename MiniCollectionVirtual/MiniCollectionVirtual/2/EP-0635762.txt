(IPU, 9), an operation portion (10), an image processing 

unit (IPU) and a workstation (WS, 2, 19). The operation 
portion (10) has a CPU for controlling image formation 

performed by the copying machine unit based on an input 
data, and a first memory for storing simulation data necessary 

for the image formation. The image processing unit has 
a second memory (4) for storing the same data as those 

stored in the first memory, and a CPU. The workstation is 
capable of taking in the data from the second memory. Data 

communication is performed between the workstation (WS, 2, 
19) and the image processing unit (IPU) and between the 

image processing unit (IPU) and the operation portion (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a simulation system for 
setting and changing a data stored in a memory as a necessary 
data for image formation performed by an image forming apparatus 
such as an electrophotographic copying machine. For example in an electrophotographic copying machine, 
calculation coefficients, adjusting data and mode selecting data 
for a scanner or an image processing unit which processes input 
image data are stored in a memory as basic data (simulation 
data) necessary for image formation. These data are generally 
changed by an operation (key input) of an operation portion of 
a copying machine unit. However, since the keys of the operation portion and the 
display screen of the copying machine are small, they tend to be 
difficult to view and inconvenient to operate. Further, the 
data input by means of up/down keys takes time. A terminal such 
as a personal computer may be connected to the copying machine 
to perform various image formation processings. In that case, 
however, since the user sits at the terminal, it is necessary 
for him or her to go over to the copying machine to input or 
change the simulation data. An object of the present invention is to provide a simulation  
 
system for use in an image forming apparatus which solves 
this problem and realizes an easy operation. To achieve the above-mentioned object, a simulation system 
of the present invention is provided with the following: an 
image forming unit; an operation portion provided in the image 
forming unit and having a central processing unit for controlling 
image formation by the image forming unit based on an input 
data, and a first memory for storing a data necessary for the 
image formation; an image processing unit having a second memory 
for storing a same data as the data stored in the first memory, 
and a central processing unit; and a workstation capable of 
taking in a data from the second memory, and connected to the 
operation portion through the image processing unit. Data 
communication is performed between the workstation and the image 
processing unit and between the image processing unit and the 
operation portion. The setting of a data to the first memory 
and the changing of a data in the first memory are controlled 
based on a command generated by operating the workstation. According to such features, the data stored in the first 
memory of the image forming unit can be set and changed by 
operating the workstation. Since the operation at the workstation 
can be performed in a
