<ABSTRACT>
A class of polypeptides useful in an in vitro diagnosis of 
coccidiosis infection in chickens is disclosed. These 

polypeptides are also capable of inducing an immune response 
in chickens which were previously not exposed to Eimeria. 

Recombinant DNA methods for the production of these 
polypeptides and phage vectors useful in these methods are 

also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a class of polypeptides 
useful in diagnostic assays to determine the presence of 
antibodies to coccidia organisms in mammals and fowl and particularly 
in chickens. The invention also relates to 
recombinant DNA methods for the manufacture of these polypeptides 
and recombinant phage clones containing DNA sequences 
suitable for use in the recombinant methods. Coccidiosis in chickens is caused by a variety of 
Eimeria species. Eimeria is endemic in chicken flocks 
throughout the world with the U.S.D.A. estimating in 1965 that 
the loss to poultry farmers in the U.S. due to Eimeria infections 
was in excess of 35 million dollars. While the various Eimeria species generally have the 
same life cycle, the site of invasion of gastro-intestinal 
epithelial cells by these organisms varies according to species. 
Normally, E. tenella is found only in the cecae of the 
chicken. E. necatrix inhabits the intestine while E.mivati 
and E. brunetti normally parasitize the posterior intestinal 
tissues. E. acervulina and E. maxima tend to invade the duodenum. By way of example of the life cycle of Eimeria, an 
Eimeria tenella infection begins when a chicken ingests food or 
water that is contaminated with sporulated oocysts. The oocyst 
wall ruptures in the bird's gizzard and the activated 
sporozoites leave the sporocyst in the small intestine. Once 
in the cecae, the sporozoites enter the cells of the surface 
epithelium, pass through the basement membrane into the lamina 
propria and locate in glands of Lieberkuhn. The sporozoites 
invade the glandular epithelial cells of the crypt, where they 
locate between the cell nucleus and the plasma membrane. Within the glandular epithelial cell, the sporozoite 
becomes a trophozoite feeding on the host cell and enlarging 
to become a schizont. During schizogony, the schizont divides 
into about 900 first-generation merozoites. The  
 
first-generation merozoites break out into the lumen of the 
cecae about three days after infection, destroying the host 
cell. Each first-generation merozoite then enters another 
cecal epithelial cell and develops into a second-generation 
schizont. About 300 second-generation merozoites are formed by 
the second schizogony. These second-generation merozoites rupture 
the host cell and proceed into the lumen of the cecum 
about 5 days after infection. Some of the second-generation 
merozoites enter new cells to begin a third generation of 
schizogony that yields up to 30 third-generation merozoites.

The phage lambda ET::Cal-2a. 
A recombinant DNA method for the manufacture of 
polypeptides analogous to Eimeria protein H, which are 

capable of inducing an antigenic response, comprising: 

a. preparation of a DNA sequence capable of directing 
a host microorganism to produce a polypeptide 

possessing antigenic properties analogous to these 
possessed by a protein according to Claim 1; 
b. cloning the DNA sequence into a vector capable of 
being transferred into and replicating in a host 

microorganism, such vector containing operational 
elements for the DNA sequence; 
c. transferring the vector containing the DNA sequence 
and operational elements into a host microorganism 

capable of expressing the antigenic polypeptides; 
d. culturing the host microorganism under conditions 
appropriate for amplification of the vector and 

expression of the polypeptide; and 
e. in either order: 

(i) harvesting the polypeptide; and 
(ii) causing the polypeptide to assume a structure 
whereby it possesses antigenic properties 

analogous to properties possessed by 
polypeptides produced by Eimeria organisms.
