<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a diffusion transfer 
heat-processable photosensitive material, and particularly to 
a diffusion transfer heat-processable photosensitive material 
wherein the density of a cyan dye image has been improved. Heat development wherein heating is used in a development 
step is conventional. Heat development for obtaining black-and-white 
images and color images are known. In addition, a 
transfer heat-processable photosensitive material wherein an 
image obtained through heat development is transferred from a 
photosensitive material to an image receiving layer is also 
well-known. A heat-processable photosensitive material ordinarily 
comprises a support and provided thereon, a binder, a 
photosensitive silver halide emulsion, a reducing agent, and  
 
optionally, a dye-providing material, an organic silver salt 
and various photographic additives. In addition, with regard 
to a transfer heat-processable photosensitive material, the 
above-mentioned photosensitive material may have an image 
receiving layer capable of receiving silver or dyes, or a 
separate image receiving material having an image receiving 
layer capable of receiving silver or dyes is used in 
combination with the photosensitive material. Among heat-processable photosensitive materials, when a 
color image is obtained, a dye-providing material forming or 
releasing a dye on heat development is ordinarily used. In 
such a color heat-processable photosensitive material, a 
method to form or release a diffusible dye on heat development 
and to diffuse and transfer the dye to a dye image receiving 
material is preferably used from the viewpoint of image 
sharpness and preservability of a dye image. As a dye-providing material used for the above-mentioned 
diffusion transfer heat development, various materials have so 
far been known. In many cases, utilization of dye-providing 
materials of the type of a wet type diffusion transfer system 
(so-called an instant photography) has been attempted. The 
above-mentioned dye-providing materials are generally divided 
into a type wherein diffusible dyes are released in accordance 
with the development of silver halide and a type wherein 
diffusible dyes are released in reverse accordance with the 
development of silver halide.  One of the latter type is a dye-providing material 
releasing a diffusible dye on reaction with a silver ion of 
silver halide or an organic silver compound unused on 
development or a soluble silver ion complex derived from 
silver particles
