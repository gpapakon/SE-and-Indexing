Method for the parametering of a digital voltage regulator with a digital display (2)
and function keys for the control of transformers with tap selector switches, wherein an

actual value is indicated in the rest state, the parameter respectively associated internally
in the regulator is identified and selected by single or repeated depression of a function

key (6 to 15), the set value of the parameter associated with the activated function key (6
to 15) is indicated, the respective next higher or next lower set value of the selected

parameter is set by trend actuation of a pulse generator (1) with activated function key (6
to 15) in the direction "higher" or "lower" and indicated at the same time and wherein this

operation is repeated until the correspondingly selected parameter has the desired value,
characterised in that the actual value indicated in the rest state is a voltage actual value,

the respective function key (6 to 15) remains activated for as long as it is depressed, the
pulse generator (1) is a scroll wheel, the respective next higher or next lower set value is

set in that it is read out of a fixed memory and filed in a non-volatile second memory, and
when the desired parameter value is reached, the respective function key (6 to 15)

depressed until then and thus activated is de-activated by being released, the set
parameter value is stored at the same time and the actual voltage value is indicated again.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that in the rest state and before the
single or repeated depression of a function key (6 to 15) the sum of the parameter values

filed in the non-volatile memory is compared with the sum of the actual set values of these
parameters, if the compared values do not agree, a fault report is activated and the

delivery of control pulses is blocked until the sum of the compared values agrees again
after new parametering of all set values and the fault report is deactivated, and after the

reading out of the respective next higher or next lower set value the sum of all set values is
recomputed and likewise filed in the non-volatile memory.
