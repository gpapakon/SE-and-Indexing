<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lead free, low toxicity
solder alloy that are particularly useful in microelectronic
applications. The solder alloy of the invention contains
major portion of Sn, and lesser portions of Bi, In, and Ag,
and respresents a high strength multi-component solder alloy.
This alloy is particularly useful in joining integrated
circuit chips to chip carriers and substrates, as printed
circuit boards, joining chip carriers to substrates, and
joining circuitization lands and pads in multilayer printed
circuit boards.Soldering is a low temperature, generally reversible,
metallurgical joining process. Low temperature and
reversibility are especially important in electronics
applications because of the materials involved and the
necessity for reworking and making engineering changes.Solder joining is a wetting process followed by a chemical
reaction. Molten solder wets selectively. The selective
wettability of solders allow molten solder to be confined to
desired sites. This is especially important in flip chip
bonding, and in working with solder masks.The soldering process can be accomplished as quickly as the
wetting takes place, for example, on the order of a few
seconds. This makes soldering particularly desirable for
automated, high speed, high throughput processes. Wettability is also a function of the materials to be joined,
with Cu, Ni, Au, and Pd, as well as alloys rich in one or more
of these metals, being particularly amenable to soldering.The chemical reaction following wetting is between the molten
solder and the joining metallurgy to form an intermetallic
phase region at the interface. The intermetallic phases
formed by solders in electronic packaging are stoichiometric
compounds, typically binary compounds, and typically
containing Sn if Sn is present in the solder alloy. When the
base, pad, or land is Cu, and the solder alloy is rich is Sn,
the intermetallic formed during soldering is Cu-Sn. Exemplary
Cu-Sn binaries include Cu3Sn and Cu6Sn5.Solder alloys are characterized by the melting temperature
being a strong function of composition. While a pure metal is
characterized by a single, invariant, melting temperature, the
freezing and melting points of alloys are complex. The
freezing point of an alloy is determined by the liquidus line.
Above the liquidus line only a liquid phase or phases can
exist. The melting point of an alloy is determined by the
solidus line. Below the solidus line only a solid phase or
phases can exist. In the region between these two lines,
i.e.
