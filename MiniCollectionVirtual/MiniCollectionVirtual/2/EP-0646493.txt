<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle seat back frame (20) including two bracing members, one 
member (25) being linearly extended from the lower end (28) of the outboard 

upright member (21) to the upper end (37) of the inboard upright member 
(22) and the other member (26) being extended linearly from the lower end 

(36) of the inboard upright member (22) to the upper end (32) of the 
outboard upright member (21), the bracing members being connected 

together at a point (58) intermediate their ends so that a side impact load 
applied to the seat back frame will place one of the bracing members fully, 

and the upper half of the other member, in tension substantially 
instantaneously upon the application of the load to the seat back frame, 

enabling the seat back frame to resist lateral deformation due to side impact 
forces applied to the seat back frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to seat assemblies for motor vehicles, and more 
particularly to a seat back frame for a vehicle seat assembly that includes 
reinforcement for resisting deflection caused by side impact loads. Conventional seat backs for vehicle seats include a quadrilateral seat 
back frame. Structural integrity of such seat back frames is provided by 
vertical inboard and outboard members which are interconnected near their 
upper and lower ends by horizontally extending cross members and 
reinforced by gusset plates at the corners of the frame. Although this type 
of reinforcement provides a degree of rigidity to the seat back, it does 
prevent deflection of the seat back frame in response to a side impact, 
resulting in lateral distortion of the seat back, particularly under a high 
impact load. Because the vehicle seats are the primary means of support 
for the occupants of the vehicle, the lateral distortion of the seat caused by 
the deflection of the seat can result in injury to the occupant of the seat, 
particularly under high impact load conditions. In U.S. Patent no. 4,192,545, there is disclosed a vehicle seat back 
frame which is reinforced by a brace which extends diagonally from the 
lower end of the outboard side member to the upper end of the inboard side  
 
member. The diagonal brace is flexed or bowed in the rearward direction to 
provide clearance for the seat so that the cushioning property of the seat 
cushion is not impaired. Although this reinforcement arrangement provides 
resistance to lateral distortion under side loading conditions, the brace must 
straighten, resulting in dynamic loading of the brace as it is placed under 
tension during loading, before the brace is placed in tension and can take 
the load. Under extreme loads, the dynamic loading could result in a 
mechanical failure, permitting the seat to deflect or parallelogram. Because 
the seat is moving or deforming at the time that the tension member is 
placed in tension, there is dynamic loading which can cause breakage at 
stress points such as weld points, connections etc. The present invention provides an improved seat back frame for a 
vehicle seat assembly. The seat back frame includes an outboard upright 
member, an inboard upright member, and upper and lower cross members 
which interconnect the upright members to form a generally rectangular 
frame. In accordance with the invention, the seat back frame includes a 
bracing means including at least one bracing member that is linearly 
extended from
