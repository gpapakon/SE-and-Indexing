<ABSTRACT>
A meter which measures fluid flow by passing the fluid through a receptacle (2) and determining the mass of fluid in the receptacle. The shape of the receptacle (2), the fluid flow path within the receptacle and the receptacle outlet (21) are chosen to ensure that for a selected fluid the mass of fluid in the receptacle is a linear function of fluid flow rate. The mass is determined by weighing (25) the receptacle (2). Total mass flow is determined by integrating (210) the mass measurement overtime if particular application of the meter is as a milk meter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the measurement of fluid flow rate and/or total mass
flow. The invention relates particularly, though not solely to measuring the flow rate
and/or total mass flow of milk supplied during milking of cows. In this application the
invention provides an electronic milk meter.By "flow rate" it is meant liquid flow rate in mass per unit time e.g. kg/min. By
"total mass flow" it is meant the integration of flow rate over the measurement time.When measuring the flow of, in particular, liquids which are not uniform in
composition, such as, for example, the milk delivered during machine milking which
foams due to substantial and varying amounts of entrained air and other gases, an
accurate determination of the flow rate or the total mass flow of liquid is difficult to
achieve. With milk, because of the differing quantities of air and other gases
contained within the milk, the density of the milk may change substantially during the
milking process. An acceptable accuracy for total mass flow is within 2% of the
actual yield of milk supplied. It has been found that it is difficult if not impossible to
remove the gas from milk to an extent that will enable this accuracy to be achieved
whilst measuring the milk volume during milking or very soon after the milking
occurs. As one of the main purposes of measuring the total mass flow is to determine
the milk yield from each animal substantial removal of gas would require the milk to
be retained in individual cow portions for a substantial period of time. Clearly this
is impractical. A method proposed to overcome the problem of density variation in
measuring milk volume is described in US 5,035,139 where the foam profile of milk
passing through a chamber is measured by measuring specific densities of the milk at
different heights in the chamber. It would, however, be advantageous to measure total
mass flow in a more direct manner rather than by making numerous volume and
density measurements. It is therefore an object of the present invention to
provide a means of measuring flow rate and/or total mass
flow which will simplify the aforementioned measuring
procedure or which will at least provide the industry with
a useful choice.According to a first aspect of the present invention,
there is provided an apparatus for measuring flow rate
and/or a part of an apparatus for measuring total mass flow of a fluid, the apparatus comprising
a chamber, an inlet to the chamber, an outlet from the
chamber, means for determining the mass of fluid in the
chamber
