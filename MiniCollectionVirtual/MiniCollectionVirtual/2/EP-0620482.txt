<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with this invention a method is provided of image 
forming by the steps of exposing a silver halide industrial X-ray 

photographic material and processing said material in an automatic 
processing machine in hardener-free developing and hardener-free 

fixing solutions followed by rinsing and drying with infrared drying 
means in the film-drying station and wherein said material comprises 

a support and on at least one side thereof at least one gelatino 
silver halide emulsion layer and at least one non-sensitive protective 

antistress coating which optionally comprises at least one 
polyoxyalkylene compound, the total amount of silver halide per 

square meter and per side corresponding to 6 to 20 g of silver 
nitrate, and that said material has been hardened with at least one 

vinyl sulphone compound thereby reducing the amount of water absorption 
of the processed film just before drying to less than 2.5 g of 

water per gram of coated gelatin. Moreover improved physical surface 
characteristics can be obtained if in addition a polyoxyalkylene 

compound is added to at least one of the hydrophilic layers of the 
photographic material and/or if during the processing of the said 

material in an automatic processing machine the hardener-free 
developer comprises as a surfactant at least one anionic alkylphenoxy 

and/or alkoxy polyalkyleneoxy phosphate ester, sulphate ester, 
alkyl carboxylic, sulphonic or phosphonic acid and/or a salt thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of providing an image on a 
silver halide photographic industrial X-ray film by image-wise 
exposure followed by processing in automatic processing machines 
filled with hardener free chemicals and having infrared drying means 
in the drying station. For industrial radiography a normal processing cycle is characterised 
by the following steps: developing at 28°C and fixing at 
26°C, rinsing and drying. The developer is normally composed from 
three concentrates that should be diluted in the right order: 
alkaline solution A contains hydroquinone, acidic solution B contains 
1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidinone and acidic solution C contains 
glutaric dialdehyd as hardening agent. The need for the complex 
three-part packaged developer concentrates has been dictated by the 
fact that glutaric aldehyd tends to react with 1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidinone, 
that this pyrazolidinone is unstable in alkaline medium and 
that glutaric aldehyd tends to polymerize in alkaline medium. The 
fixer is composed from 2 concentrated solutions, whereby solution A 
contains the commonly used highly active ammonium thiosulphate as a 
fixing agent and solution B contains aluminum sulphate as a hardening 
agent. Hardening agents are necessary to lead the film through 
the processor without damages, to reduce the amount of water absorption 
and, as a consequence, to reduce the drying time and to enhance 
the drying capacity. This is especially important for industrial X-ray 
films as these films are coated with a high amount of gelatin 
e.g. about 30 g/m². The said high amount of gelatin is a consequence 
of the need to have high coated amounts of silver halide crystals 
capable of absorbing direct X-rays in industrial X-ray applications. Damages of the film in the processor are e.g. due to sticking 
phenomena which may occur due to an inadequate drying method. The 
drying process can be improved by the use of e.g. infrared dryers. From an ecological and an economical point of view, it would be 
important to depart from the concept of hardener containing processing 
solutions and to work more customer-friendly.  By omitting the toxicologically questionable glutaric dialdehyd 
from the developer and the aluminum sulphate from the fixer one-part 
package chemistry could be offered to the customer. From an environmental 
point of view specific advantages resulting therefrom would 
be a reduction in package waste and a customer-friendly treatment 
which doesn't require the preparation of a mixture of two or three
