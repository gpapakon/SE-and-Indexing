An encapsulated measuring device for determining the relative position between two objects, with

a measuring body (3), which is fitted in a hollow body (2; 22; 23; 26; 28; 29) together with a
sensing unit (4) sensing the measuring body,
a driver (5) for connecting the sensing unit (4) to one of the objects to be measured via a
mounting foot (6; 62; 63; 66; 68; 69);
a seal operating in contact, with flexible sealing lips (7, 8), with which the hollow body (2; 22;
23; 26; 28; 29) is sealed, and between which the driver (5) engages, so that the seal (7, 8)

surrounds the driver (5) in contact therewith;
an additional seal (9, 9a; 10, 10a) which acts outside the region in which the driver (5) engages
through its contacting seal (7, 8), characterized in that
the additional seal (9, 9a; 10, 10a) shields the space between the contacting seal (7, 8) and the
mounting foot (6; 62; 63; 66; 68; 69) against detrimental environmental effects,
the additional seal (9, 9a; 10, 10a) is a labyrinth-like contact-free seal in the form of webs (9a,
10a; 92,102; 93; 96; 98a; 99) and slot-like recesses (9, 10; 9a2, 10a2; 93a; 96; 98a; 99a)

arranged on both sides ofthe drive (5) along the hollow body (2; 22; 23; 26; 28; 29) and the

mounting foot (6; 62; 63; 66; 68; 69), which is subject to environmental effects.
A measuring device according to claim 1, characterized in that the webs (9a, 10a; 98a) are
formed by projections on the hollow body (2; 28), which engage in the manner of teeth in slot-like

recesses (9, 10;98) in the mounting foot (6; 68).
A measuring device according to claim 1, characterized in that the webs (92,102; 93; 96; 99) are
formed by projections on the mounting foot (62; 63; 66; 69), which engage in the manner of teeth

in slot-like recesses (9a2, 10a2; 93a; 96a; 99a) in the hollow body (22; 23; 26; 29).
A measuring device according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the webs (93) are
fitted as separate components in the hollow body or the mounting foot (63).
A measuring device according to claim 1, characterized in that further seals (1110, 1210) in the
form of strippers are provided in the end region of the mounting foot (610).
A measuring device according to any of claims 1 to 5, charactenzed in that the flexible sealing
lips (7, 8) are arranged in V-form on the hollow body (2; 22; 23; 26; 28; 29).
