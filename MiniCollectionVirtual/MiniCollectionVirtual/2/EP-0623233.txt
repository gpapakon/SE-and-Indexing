a drawer (2) which is divided in the sliding direction (S) 

into n compartments (2.1; 2.2;...2.n) with associated drawer 
depths (a
n
), and by a time-controlled release and extension 
device for the drawer (2) through which when triggered the 

drawer (2) is pushed out from the housing (1) by one drawer 
depth (a
n
) each time in a predetermined and adjustable time 
interval one after the other beginning with the first (a‚ÇÅ), 

until the drawer (2) on sliding into the closed position is 
locked again and the release mechanism is switched off.
