A process for simultaneous transmitting of audio signals
of N signal sources via a corresponding number of

transmission channels,

in which the individual signals are divided into blocks
and said blocks are transformed into spectral coefficients

by transformation or filtering, said spectral
coefficients undergoing a data reduction process, and in

which the allotment of the maximum disposable trans- mitting
capacity is calculated for each individaul signal

from the entire disposable transmitting capacity and the
currently required overall transmitting capacity and each

individual signal whose capacity was determined in this
manner is encoded and transmitted,

characterized by the following features:

said blocks belonging to said individual signals are
divided into sections,
the respective current sections of all signals are
processed simultaneously,

the permissible interference for each section is determined
utilizing a perception-specific model and a request

of currently required overall transmitting capacity is
calculated.
Process according to claim 1,

characterized by there being a reserve of transmitting
capacity (bit reservoir) from which an allotment occurs

if the required overall transmitting capacity exceeds the
average transmitting capacity at disposal.
Process according to claim 2,

characterized by said bit reservoir being filled if the 
requested transmitting capacity is smaller than the

transmitting capacity at disposal.
A process according to claim 3,

characterized by a forced allotment occurring in order to
prevent said bit reservoir from increasing too greatly if

the requested transmitting capacity is very much smaller
than the transmitting capacity at disposal.
A process according to claim 4,

characterized by said forced allotment only occurring if
there is a need greater than the average need.
A process according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized
by identical input signals being recognized

and being transmitted only once by a suited transmitting
format.
A process according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized
by the determination of the currently required

transmitting capacity occuring accurately.
A process according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized
by said determination of said currently required

transmitting capacity being only estimated.
A process according to one of the claims 1 to 8, characterized
by an overall block being formed from all the

separately encoded signals from the signal sources, said
overall block being composed of a fixed section containing

information from which the separation of said individual
signals can be determined and composed of several

regions of flexible length. 
A process according to one of the claims 1 to 9,
characterized by said encoding of said individual signals

already occurring during the calculation of the allotment
of the transmitting capacity for each signal.
A process according to one of the claims 1 to 10,
characterized by, if the requested number of bits exceeds

the overall number of bits at disposal, the permissable
interference for all the signal sources being increased

so that a reduced bit request is yielded.
