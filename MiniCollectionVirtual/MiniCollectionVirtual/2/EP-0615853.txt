compound, an optional pigment, and an optional binder. In a preferred embodiment, the 

phosphonium compound is selected from the group consisting of 

wherein R is an alkyl group, X is an anion, and all four R groups are the same; 

wherein R is an alkyl group, wherein all three R groups are the same, wherein R is not the same 
as R', X is an anion, and R' is selected from the group consisting of alkyl groups, substituted 

alkyl groups, arylalkyl groups, and substituted arylalkyl groups; 

wherein Ar is an aryl group or a substituted aryl group, X is an anion, and all four Ar groups are 
the same; 


wherein Ar is an aryl group or a substituted aryl group, wherein all three Ar groups are the 
same, X is an anion, and R' is selected from the group consisting of alkyl groups, substituted 

alkyl groups, arylalkyl groups, and substituted arylalkyl groups; and mixtures thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to recording sheets, such as transparency materials, 
filled plastics, papers, and the like. More specifically, the present invention is directed to 
recording sheets particularly suitable for use in ink jet printing processes. Recording sheets suitable for use in ink jet printing are known. For example, US-A-4,740,420 
(Akutsu et al.) discloses a recording medium for ink jet printing comprising a support 
material containing at least in the surface portion thereof a water soluble metal salt with the 
ion valence of the metal thereof being 2 to 4 and a cationic organic material. The cationic 
organic materials include salts of alkylamines, quaternary ammonium salts, polyamines, and 
basic latexes. US-A-4,576,867 (Miyamoto) discloses an ink jet recording paper with improved water 
resistance and sunlight fastness of the image formed on the paper wherein the recording paper 
has attached to its surface a cationic resin of the formula 
 
wherein R1, R2, and R3 represent alkyl groups, m represents a number of 1 to 7, and n 
represents a number of 2 to 20, and Y represents an acid residue. EP-A-506,034 discloses a method for forming images by thermal transfer process. The 
method comprises the steps of of providing a printing sheet having an image-receiving layer on 
one side thereof, providing an ink ribbon having a dye layer comprising a hydrophilic cationic 
dye, contacting the ink ribbon with the image receiving layer, and applying thermal energy to 
the ink ribbon in an imagewise pattern to thermally transfer the dye from the ink ribbon to the 
image-receiving layer. The image-receiving layer comprises at least a layer compound which 
has ion exchangeability with the cationic dye, so that the dye image is fixed through the ion 
exchange. While known compositions and processes are suitable for their intended purposes, a 
need remains for improved recording sheets. In addition, there is a need for improved 
recording sheets suitable for use in ink jet printing processes. Further, a need remains for 
recording sheets for ink jet printing with a high degree of waterfastness. Additionally, there is 
a need for paper recording sheets for ink jet printing with reduced showthrough of the images  
 
on the side of the paper opposite to that printed. There is also a need for recording sheets for 
ink jet printing with enhanced optical density. It is an object of the present invention to provide recording sheets with the above 
noted advantages. The present invention provides a
