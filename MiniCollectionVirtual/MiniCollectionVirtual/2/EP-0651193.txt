<ABSTRACT>
The invention specifies a device for fixing elongated articles (1,2) to a base, in the case of which use is made of clamps (3,4) made of spring steel. The clamps (3,4) have a fastening part (A) for fixing them to the base (5), two legs (S1,S2), which are connected integrally to the fastening part (A) and are separated from one another by an interspace in order to receive in each case one elongated article (1,2), and also have a locking mechanism which comprises a rectangular bracket (B) which is fitted at the free end of one leg (S2) and can be pivoted over the end of the other leg (S1). In order to mount two elongated articles (1,2) one above the other, two of said clamps (3,4) are fitted one above the other, with the interposition of a securing means (6), such that the fastening part (A) of one clamp (4) is connected fixedly to the bracket (B), located in the locking position, of the other clamp (3).

Device for fixing elongated objects to a base, 
having clips consisting of spring steel which exhibit a 

fixing part for their securement to the base, two legs, 
which are connected in one piece to the fixing part and 

are separated from each other by an interspace for 
receiving in each case one elongated object and a locking 

device, which comprises a rectangular bar which is 
attached to the free end of the one leg and can be folded 

over the end of the other leg, characterized in that at 
least two of these clips (3, 4) are attached one on top 

of the other, with intermediate connection of a mount (6) 
in such a way that the fixing part (A) of the one clip 

(3, 4) is permanently connected to the bar (B), located 
in the locking position, of the other clip (3, 4). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a first part (T1) of the mount (6) rests on the ends 

of the legs (S1, S2) of the clip (3, 4) which is sealed 
to the bar (B) and is permanently connected to the fixing 

part (A) of the one clip (3, 4) and to the bar (B) of the 
other clip (3, 4). 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the mount (6) has a second part (T2) which lies 

on that side of the bar (B) which faces away from the 
first part (T1). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that projections (8, 9), which, in the mounted 

position, engage in the bar (B) which serves to secure 
the mount (6), are provided on both parts (T1, T2) of the 

mount (6). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized  
 

in that the two parts (T1, T2) of the mount (6) 
are connected to one another to form a single-piece 

mount.
