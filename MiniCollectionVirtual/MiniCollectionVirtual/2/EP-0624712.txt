<ABSTRACT>
A submarine wellhead anchorage for a flowline or 
control umbilical (11) consists of a line head (15) which 

is inserted and secured within a clamp at the wellhead. 
The clamp comprises pretensioned studs (26) which are 

elastically extended by pressure applied within surrounding 
sleeves (27) during insertion of the head, release of the 

pressure allowing the studs to contract and energise the 
clamp.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an anchorage for a tubular
line, such as a flowline or control umbilical, at a
wellhead, such as to a spool or tree valve block of a
wellhead.Conventionally, such anchorages have been completed
with diver assistance. The obvious dangers and operational
complications of diver assistance, combined with increasing
water depth at completion sites, have necessitated the
development of diverless completion operations in the
offshore oil and gas industry.Previous diverless line connections have involved the
use of expensive, complicated and time consuming, remotely
activated pull-in and connection tool packages. In a
typical example of such prior diverless connection, a pull-in
tool, incorporating a sheave-carrying guide frame, is
lowered to the guide base and is used to pull a head on the
line into a guide sleeve, in which it is clamped. The
pull-in tool shears the pull-in cable, and is then replaced
by a connection tool which removes a pull-in nose on the
line head, and a cap on a christmas tree hub, and advances
the guide sleeve so that the line head is brought into
sealing engagement with the hub and latched into engagement
with the hub. The connection tool is then retracted to the
surface.US-A-3442540 discloses a submarine wellhead anchorage
for a flexible tubular line comprising a head, which is, in
use, attached to the end of the line, and a clamp, which
is, in use, mounted at the wellhead; the clamp comprising
a pair of jaws which are pulled together by tension studs
to grip the head between them.According to the present invention, such an anchorage
is characterised in that each stud is surrounded by a
sleeve which defines a pressure chamber effectively
interposed between the two jaws; and by means for supplying
hydraulic pressure to the pressure chambers whereby the 
jaws are parted and the studs are stretched elastically to
allow insertion of the head between the jaws.Although the line head may be inserted in the clamp
with diver assistance, the system is particularly suitable
for diverless operation. In that event the line head will
normally be inserted into the clamp by being drawn in by
means of a pull-in cable attached to a nose at the leading
end of the head. The pull-in cable may pass around a
sheave which forms a permanent component of the tree or
other wellhead part, for tensioning by a ROV or from the
surface. It follows that the line head will be drawn in
and clamped in its final anchored position in a single
movement with the minimum of parts.Although hydraulic

A submarine wellhead anchorage for a flexible tubular
line comprising a head (15), which is, in use, attached to

the end of the line (11), and a clamp, which is, in use,
mounted at the wellhead; the clamp comprising a pair of

jaws (23,24) which are pulled together by tension studs
(26) to grip the head between them; characterised in that

each stud is surrounded by a sleeve (27) which defines a
pressure chamber effectively interposed between the two

jaws; and by means (35) for supplying hydraulic pressure to
the pressure chambers whereby the jaws are parted and the

studs are stretched elastically to allow insertion of the
head between the jaws.
An anchorage according to claim 1, in which one of the
jaws (24) houses a locking key (30) which is urged into

engagement with the head (15) to prevent withdrawal of the
head from the clamp, the key being retractible by a piston

(31) which is responsive to the hydraulic pressure applied
to the pressure chambers.
An anchorage according to claim 1 or claim 2, in which
the head incorporates a passage (16,17), one end of which

in use is connected to the interior of the line, and the
other end of which terminates in a port (18) aligned with

a second port (40) in one of the clamp jaws (23) when the
head is inserted into the clamp.
An anchorage according to claim 3, in which the one
jaw (23) is provided with an annular seal (41) around the

second port for engagement with, and sealing against, the
head (15).
An anchorage according to any one of the preceding
claims, in which the studs (26) are arranged in two rows,

one on each side of the head. 
An anchorage according to any one of the preceding
claims, in which the opposed faces of the jaws (23,24) and

the complementary faces of the head (15) converge in the
direction of the insertion of the head into the clamp.
An anchorage according to any one of the preceding
claims, in which a nose (19) at the leading end of the head

is provided with means (20) for connecting a pull-in cable
(21).
An anchorage according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein each sleeve (27) is screwed at one end to

one of the jaws (25) and is slidable at its other end in,
and sealed to, a pocket (28) in the other jaw.
