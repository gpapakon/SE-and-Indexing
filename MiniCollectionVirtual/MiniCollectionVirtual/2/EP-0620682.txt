<ABSTRACT>
In a video signal transmitting system for transmitting a 
video signal having a specific horizontal line containing an 

effective picture portion in which an original identification 
signal related to picture information of the video 

signal is inserted, the video signal transmitting system is 
characterized by that a loss of the original identification 

signal in transmission is protected as such that the lost 
original identification signal is substituted by another 

identification signal which is identical to or related to 
the original and is included in another effective picture 

portion of another horizontal line preceding to the specific 
horizontal line. Insertion of identical identification 

signal of such to a plurality of horizontal lines assures a 
further protection from a longer dropout involving a series 

of horizontal lines which may caused due to a scratch made 
on a recording medium recorded with the video signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a video 
signal transmitting system in a television field. More 
specifically, the present invention is directed to a video 
signal transmitting system capable of compensating for an 
identification signal indicative of a sort of aspect ratio 
of transmitted or displayed picture. Referring now to Fig. 1, a description is made that a 
portion of a video track on a recorded magnetic tape is 
damaged by a scratch. Fig, 2 schematically represents a 
waveform of an identification signal. A conventional video 
signal transmitting system will now be explained with 
reference to Figs. 1 and 2. Very recently, various researches have been made in the 
video signal transmitting systems for a high quality television 
picture of 16:9 aspect ratio, which are compatible with 
a conventional television system of 4:3 aspect ratio 
picture. Then, the video signal received by these normal television 
receivers can be various types of signals respectively 
having different aspect ratio pictures (hereinafter simply 
referred to as "aspect ratio"), and if these various types  
 
of video signals could be automatically discriminated from 
each other based upon the aspect ratios, the normal television 
receivers may readily respond to the incoming video 
signals correspondingly with the proper television systems 
with different aspect ratios. To this end, there have been 
proposed such systems capable of realizing easy signal 
transmissions and extendable features that the identification 
signal for identifying at least the aspect ratio is 
inserted into the video signal. It should be noted that the 
source of the video signal may be a packaged video media 
such as tape reproduced on a VTR. As one of these video signal transmission systems, the 
electronic Industries Association of Japan has proposed a 
document of provisional specifications "Specifications and 
Transfer Method of Video Aspect Ratio Identification Signal 
(II) (525-line system)" as EIAJ CPX-1204. In this provisional 
system, the various sorts of identification signals such 
as identification signals capable of identifying the sort of 
aspect ratio are inserted into the 20th horizontal(H) line 
and the 283rd horizontal (H) line in the vertical blanking 
period of the video signal. As illustrated in Fig. 2, this 
video signal 10 has a reference signal "a" used to the level 
adjustment in the effective picture portion 11 within the 
relevant 1 horizontal line, and the signal "b" subsequent to 
the reference signal "a",

<CLAIMS>
A video signal transmitting system for transmitting a 
video signal having a specific horizontal line containing an 

effective picture portion where a first identification 
signal related to picture information of the video signal is 

inserted into the effective picture portion, said video 
signal transmitting system comprising: 

   means for inserting one of second and third identification 
signals into a horizontal line adjacent to said 

specific horizontal line where said second identification 
signal is identical to said first identification signal and 

said third identification signal is a signal related to said 
first identification signal, so that a loss of said first 

identification signal in a transmission line is substituted 
by said one of second and third identification signals. 
A video signal transmitting system as claimed in Claim 
1, in which said inserting means inserts a plurality of said 

one of second and third identification signals into a 
plurality of said horizontal line respectively in recording 

of said video signal on a recording medium, so that when a 
dropout of said first identification signal occurs upon 

reproducing said recording medium, said plurality of said 
one of second and third identification signals inserted into 

said plurality of said horizontal line and are unharmed due 
to the dropout, are made available for substituting the 

first identification signal subjected to said dropout. 
A video signal transmitting system as claimed in Claim 
2, in which said plurality of said one of second and third 

identification signals inserted into said plurality of said 
horizontal line and are unharmed due to the dropout, are 

utilized to determine the first identification signal subjected 
to said dropout.
