<ABSTRACT>
The application relates to an ash-free detergent/dispersant, polymeric additive composition in the manner of polyolefin-succinic anhydride derivatives or an oily solution thereof which can be used in lubricating oil formulations or internal combustion engines, characterised in that it comprises components which carry an average from 1.6 to 6 succinic anhydride derivatives on polyolefin chains having the same number average molecular weight, where the amount of molecules containing more than three succinic anhydride derivatives is 0.1-15 % by weight, and where the derivative can be an imide and/or ester and/or amide and/or ester amide derivative, and in that the additive composition contains at least two components having different number average molecular weights (one relatively low and one relatively high), where the number average molecular weight of the components of relatively low molecular weight is lower than six times the average molecular weight of the starting polyolefin, and the weight ratio between the components of relatively high molecular weight and the components of relatively low molecular weight is 0.01-5.
