<ABSTRACT>
A heating device for heating an item such as a carburetor 
uses a first PTC heating element 12 positioned compactly within a 

housing 10 which is directly adjacent the item to be heated. A 
second PTC element 14 having a great electrical resistance 

increase at a prescribed temperature level is also compactly 
contained in the housing and is electrically connected in series 

to the first PTC element 12. This second PTC element 14 
restricts the electric current flow through the device when the 

ambient temperature exceeds the prescribed temperature level.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a heating device; and more 
particularly, to a heating device which is suitable for use in an 
internal combustion engine. In a carburetor used in the internal combustion engine of a 
motorcycle or an automobile, there is typically provided a 
heating device for enhancing the atomization of the fuel and the 
mixing thereof with air in a regular fashion in a cold starting 
situation. Generally, the heating device is installed adjacent 
the throttle valve of the carburetor, and is operational at an 
ambient temperature lower than a prescribed temperature. Under 
these conditions, the resistance heater is made electrically 
conductive and the carburetor is warmed by the resistance 
heating, thereby melting or preventing the icing inside the 
carburetor. A PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) element has 
mostly been used as the resistance heater element for these 
devices. The PTC element has such characteristics that, at the time 
when the temperature reaches a prescribed predetermined level, 
there is a sudden increase in the resistance value of the 
element. This increase in resistance will restrict the electric 
current passing through the PTC heater; and accordingly, 
automatically restrict the heating provided by the PTC element. 
If the PTC element continues to be electrically conductive,  
 
however, the electric power is not only wasted but there also 
develops a danger that the fuel will be overheated as the heat is 
accumulated inside the carburetor. Because of this, it is 
ordinarily the case that the electrical flow through the element 
is terminated at the time when the temperature of the carburetor 
has reached a suitable value. In the heating device, according to the prior art, a bimetal 
type thermostat is electrically connected in series with the PTC 
heating element to disconnect it from the electrical source at 
the time when the ambient temperature (carburetor or atmospheric 
temperature) happens to be higher than a prescribed level. That 
is, the bimetal of the thermostat snaps to an open position, 
thereby terminating the electrical current to the PTC element. The heating device coupled with a bimetal type thermostat, 
as described above according to prior art, has had restrictions 
in terms of the freedom of the package design, durability and 
reliability, switching characteristics and temperature control 
characteristics, etc. Irrespective of whether the bimetal type 
thermostat is accommodated in a separate package or in the same 
package with the
