<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a laser disk carrying case including two 
outer shells connected together to hold a disk holder, which 

can be conveniently turned out of the shells for storing an 
individual laser disk or retrieving it from the case, and 

then turned into the shells and locked in place. A wedge 
block is made on one shell, which is engaged into an opening 

on the base of the disk holder to lock it inside the shells. 
The disk holder has spring pawls on a center hole thereof to 

hold a laser disk on a circular mat thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser disk carrying 
case for carrying a laser disk which comprises a housing 
formed of two symmetrical shells, and a disk holder pivoted 
to one shell and turned in or out of the shells for storing 
a laser disk or retrieving it from the case. Various laser disk carrying cases have been proposed 
for carrying individual laser disks, and have been appeared 
on the market. These laser disk carrying cases are commonly 
comprised of a cover shell hinged to a bottom shell and 
locked by lock means. When opening the cover shell, one may 
have to try several times to find the correct direction. 
Another disadvantage of the prior art laser disk carrying 
cases is that the cover shell may get stuck easily, and one 
shell have to apply more labor in opening the case. 
Further, the individual laser disk may fall out of place as 
the cover shell is opened. The present invention eliminates the aforesaid 
disadvantages. It is therefore an object of the present 
invention to provide a laser disk carrying case which is 
simple in structure and durable in use. It is another 
object of the present invention to provide a laser disk 
carrying case which is inexpensive to manufacture and easy 
to assemble. It is still another object of the present 
invention to provide a laser disk carrying case which is 
easy to open. It is still another object of the present 
invention to provide a laser disk carrying case which can 
hold a laser disk firmly in place when opened.  According to the preferred embodiment of the present 
invention, the laser disk carrying case is generally 
comprised of two outer shells connected together to hold a 
disk holder, which can be turned out of the shells for 
storing or retrieving an individual laser disk, and then 
turned into the shells and locked in place by a wedge block 
on one shell. The shells are connected by hooking the hooks 
of a first shell on the respective retaining slots on the 
other shell and engaging the raised portions on the first 
shell into the respective round holes on the second shell. 
The disk holder has spring pawls on the center of a circular 
mat thereof for holding an individual laser disk in place, 
and a finger strip for moving with the hand.

<CLAIMS>
A laser disk carrying case comprising: 
   a first shell made from a flat rectangular plate having 

a left vertical side wall and a right vertical side 
respectively raised from two opposite sides thereof in the 

same direction, a center wedge block and a lateral 
projecting plate respectively raised from a third side 

thereof, the left vertical side wall comprising a front gap 
at one end, a hook and a small raised portion on an inside 

at two opposite ends, and an elongated recessed portion on a 
top edge thereof, the right vertical side wall comprising a 

hook and a small raised portion on an inner side at two 
opposite ends, and an elongated recessed portion on a top 

edge thereof, said lateral projecting plate being spaced 
from the right vertical side wall by a gap; 

   a second shell made from a flat rectangular plate 
having a left vertical side wall, a right vertical side wall 

and a rear vertical side wall respectively raised from three 
contiguous sides thereof in the same direction and connected 

into a continuous peripheral wall, an angle block raised 
from the other side thereof and connected to its right 

vertical side wall, and a pin on the inside adjacent to said 
angle block, the left vertical side wall of said second 

shell comprising an outer small raised portion at a location 
corresponding to the front gap on said left vertical side 

wall of the first shell, a retaining slot, on which the hook 
of the left vertical side wall of said first shell hooks, a 

small round hole, into which the raised portion on the left 
 

vertical side wall of said first shell engages, and an 
elongated outside rail fitted into the recessed portion on 

the left vertical side wall of said first shell, the right 
vertical side wall of said second shell comprising, a 

retaining slot, on which the hook of the right vertical side 
wall of said first shell hooks, a small round hole, into 

which the raised portion on the right vertical side wall of 

said first shell engages, and an elongated outside rail 
fitted into the recessed portion on the right vertical side 

wall of said first shell; and 
   a disk holder connected to said second shell and turned 

inside the holding space defined within said first and 
second shells or out of said first and second shells for 

storing or a laser disk or retrieving it, said disk holder 
comprising a circular mat perpendicularly connected to an 

elongated base plate by connecting strips, said base plate 
comprising an opening, into which said wedge block of said 

first shell is inserted to lock said disk holder inside said 
first and second shells, an outer surface embossed with 

decorative stripes, a finger strip at one end extended out 
of said second shell, a projecting plate perpendicularly 

extended inwards from said finger strip, an axle hole at an 
opposite end, into which said pin of said second shell 

inserts, and a notch adjacent to the axle hole, into which 
said angle block of said second shell is engaged to stop 

said disk holder in an open position out of said first and 
second shells, said finger strip having a small round hole 

on an outer side, into which the raised portion on the left 
 

vertical side wall of said second shell engages, said 
circular mat having a laser disk retainer at the center, 

said laser disk retainer comprising two symmetrical spring 
pawls on an elongated center hole for holding a laser disk. 
The laser disk carrying case of claim 1 wherein said 
first shell is marked with a directional mark adjacent to 

said finger strip to indicate the direction in turning said 
disk holder out of said first and second shells.
