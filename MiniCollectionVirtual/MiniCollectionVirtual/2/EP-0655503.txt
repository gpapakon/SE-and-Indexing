<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing recombinant human serum 
albumin (HSA) which comprises culturing an HSA producing host 

prepared by gene manipulation techniques at a temperature of 
from 21 to 29°C. Culturing the HSA producing host under such 

a specified temperature condition makes it possible to 
increase productivity of HSA production, improve the growth 

yield of an HSA producing host, and reduce the degree of 

coloring in the HSA preparation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the improvement of a
process for producing human serum albumin (to be referred to
as "HSA" hereinafter) by the culturing of a host transformed
by means of gene manipulation techniques.HSA is a main component constituting blood plasma and
is used in pharmaceutical preparations for the treatment of
massive hemorrhage, shock, burns, hypoproteinemia or fetal
erythroblastosis.Currently, HSA is produced mainly as a fractionated
product from collected blood. However, such a production
process has problems because it is economically
disadvantageous and the supply of blood is sporadic. In
addition, there may a problem with the blood itself, as blood
may contain undesirable substances, such as the hepatitis
virus.The recent development of recombinant DNA techniques
has rendered possible the production of various useful
polypeptides by microorganisms and cells, and research and
development efforts have actively been made on the large
scale production of HSA by means of gene manipulation
techniques. However, because of low production yields, there
still is an unsettled problem concerning the establishment of 
techniques for high purity, low cost, industrial production
of HSA.The culturing of an HSA producing host prepared by
gene manipulation techniques in a medium has been carried out
at 30°C when the host is a yeast strain (JP-A-3-83595 and
JP-A-4-299984 corresponding to EP-A-506040; the term "JP-A"
as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent
application").In view of the above circumstances, an object of the
present invention is to increase the productivity of HSA
production, especially through the improvement of culture
conditions.With the aim of achieving the above object, the
inventors of the present invention have conducted intensive
studies and found that the productivity of HSA production can
be increased, the growth yield of the HSA producing host can
be improved and coloring of the product can be inhibited when
an HSA producing host prepared by gene manipulation
techniques is cultured at a temperature of from 21 to 29°C.
The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of
this finding.Accordingly, the present invention provides a process
for producing recombinant human serum albumin that comprises
culturing a human serum albumin producing host prepared by 
gene manipulation techniques at a temperature of from 21 to
29°C.Other objects and advantages of the present invention
will be made apparent as the description progresses.The HSA producing host
