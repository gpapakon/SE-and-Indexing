<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a method for producing a drug system for delivering a drug for the treatment of a condition, comprising producing a bio-compatible matrix containing an immobilised drug and at least one receptor for a physiological substance in the environment of the matrix, said receptor being activated in response to the levels of said physiological substance to effect a conformational change in the matrix allowing mobilisation and release of the drug into the environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method for producing a system for delivering a
drug or other agent in a controlled release manner.Most known 'controlled-release' drug systems are constant slow-release
mechanisms (US 4,145,410). These systems do not react to any inherent substances in
the body to release the drug appropriately in response to that substance, ie. there is no
feedback mechanism. Feedback mechanisms have been suggested to be of interest in
vivo to maintain general homeostasis.US 4,348,387 discloses a feedback controlled insulin delivery system wherein
glucose-insulin conjugates a-e displaced from glucose binding sites on a binding
molecule by free glucose. The conjugated insulin retains its biological activity once
released. However, it is not known whether other agents or drugs can be so conjugated
or whether such a conjugated form of any drug or other agent would be effective.The present invention provides a controlled drug delivery system for the
controlled release of an unconjugated drug or other agent. According to the present invention there is provided a method for producing
a system for delivering a drug or other agent, comprising producing a bio-compatible
matrix having a conformation which reversibly immobilises the drug or other agent,
wherein the matrix contains at least one receptor having a plurality of binding sites for
a substrate in the environment of the matrix and for a crosslinking agent, said receptors
being activated in response to the levels of said substrate to effect a conformational
change in the matrix allowing mobilisation and release of the drug or agent into the
environment, the conformational change in the matrix allowing mobilisation being
effected by the binding of the substrate to the binding sites such that it displaces the
crosslinking agent from the binding sites, and the conformational change in the matrix
allowing immobilisation being effected by the binding of the crosslinking agent to the
binding sites such that when substrate is bound to the binding sites it displaces the
substrate from the binding sites. As can be seen from the example below, immobilisation
of the drug within the matrix is a purely physical restriction.The matrix may be a gel matrix, the conformational change in the matrix
allowing mobilisation being an ungelling and the conformational change in the matrix
allowing immobilisation being a gelling. The system may be for delivering a drug or
other agent for the treatment of a condition.The agent or drug may comprise a naturally occurring
