<ABSTRACT>
A novel physiologically active substance exhibiting a 
plasma kallikrein production inhibiting action, peripheral 

blood flow improving action and analgesic, antiinflammatory 
and antiallergic actions is offered. 
The physiologically active substance of the present 
invention is prepared by activating various animals or animal 

tissues by means of inoculating virus or tumor cells which 
act as a stressor and then by extracting the effective factor 

from the activated tissues. The invention relates to a 
substance which exhibits a pharmacological action of 

inhibiting an activity for the plasma kallikrein production 
and recovers and normalizes the abnormal function which is 

resulted in the diseased state. 
The physiologically active substance of the present 
invention exhibiting an excellent regulating activity for 

biofunctions has an action of recovering and normalizing the 
abnormal function of the living organisms in various diseased 

states and is quite useful as a pharmaceutical such as a 
peripheral blood flow improving agent, analgesic agent, 

antiinflammatory agent and antiallergic agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel physiologically
active substance which is extracted from a tissue activated
by internal and external stressors.Living organisms keep each of their lives as individuals
by adjusting and maintaining their physical and chemical
states to and within certain stable physiological conditions
corresponding to the changes in internal and external
circumstances.In order to maintain and adjust such homeostasis, the
living organism always produces various substances in vivo
and, in case of an invasion of viruses, bacteria, etc. and of
a generation of tumor cells, it also produces certain
substances in vivo which are resistant to such external and
internal invasions.However, if the above-mentioned biofunctions are
unbalanced for some reason and that becomes chronic, then so-called
morbidity results causing various diseases.The ideal way of curing the disease is that the function
of the organism to maintain homeostasis is activated and
adjusted so that the abnormal imbalance of the disordered
biofunction recovers to a normal state. It is well known
that the maintenance and the normalization of the biofunction
are carried out especially by various receptors on cell
surfaces and the ion channels such as sodium, potassium,
calcium, etc. It is known that, upon growing older, the recovering
ability of DNA against damage lowers in mammalian cells and
that the production of free radicals in vivo promotes ageing,
collagen disease and generation of cancer. Incidentally,
collagen is a noncellular substance widely present in skins,
blood vessels, cartilages, eye balls, kidney, etc. and, with
an advance in age, a crosslinking of collageneous materials
proceeds whereby their elasticity reduces and they become
hard. It is well known that, in patients suffering from
diabetes, an excessive crosslinking of the collageneous
materials proceeds as a result of a continuing high sugar
level in the blood, whereby cataracts, atherosclerosis, renal
diseases, peripheral nervous disorders, etc. particularly
result.By paying attention to the function of maintaining
homeostasis of living organisms which adjusts and recovers
the strain in nervous, immunological and endocrine systems
caused by a disorder of cell functions in vivo as a result of
diseases and ageing, the present inventors have conducted an
extensive investigation into the substances which are
produced at the resisting stage of the organisms against the
internal and external stresses (i.e. at the activating stage
of the living tissues) and
