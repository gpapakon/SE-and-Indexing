<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention the vehicle level control is modified or prevented whilst the vehicle is cornering. Two control modes are provided for controlling the vehicle level, which differ at least in the length of their control time lag. According to the invention, on detection of the end of vehicle cornering, the control mode with the shorter control time lag is selected. In an advantageous embodiment of the invention it is proposed that, on detection of the end of vehicle cornering, a certain deviation from the set value for the vehicle level be detected in addition in order to select the control mode with the shorter control time lag. In addition provision may be advantageously made for the prevention of vehicle level control as a function of the detection of the start of cornering, especially immediately following detection of the start of cornering. The invention is of use, especially in newly developed buses with independent wheel suspension of the front axle.

Method for regulating the motor vehicle level
to a desired value, the regulation of the vehicle level

being at least modified during cornering of the
vehicle, 
characterized in that
for regulating the vehicle level outside cornering
at least two regulating modes (26, 27) are

provided which differ from one another at least in
the length of their regulation idle time (tau1,

tau2), and
after the detection (22, 24) of the end of a
cornering of the vehicle the regulating mode (26)

with the shorter regulation idle time (tau1) is
selected.
Method for regulating the motor vehicle level
to a desired value, the regulation of the vehicle level

being at least modified during cornering of the
vehicle, 
characterized in that
for regulating the vehicle level outside cornering
at least two regulating modes (26, 27) are

provided which differ from one another at least in
the length of their regulation idle time (tau1,

tau2), and
after the detection (22, 24) of the end of a
cornering of the vehicle regulating mode (26) with

the shorter regulation idle time (tau1) is
selected when a specific deviation from the

desired value for the motor vehicle level is 
detected, there being provision, in particular,

for the specific deviation detected to be a slant
of the vehicle body (25).
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
in that
, as a function of the detection (22) of the
start of cornering, the regulation of the vehicle level

is modified in such a way that regulation ceases.
Method according to Claim 2, 
characterized in
that
, as a function of the detection (22, 24) of the
end of cornering of the vehicle and as a function of

the detection that the motor vehicle level falls short
of a specific deviation from the desired value for the

motor vehicle level, the regulating mode (27) with the
longer regulation idle time (tau2) is selected.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
in that
, the shorter regulation idle time (tau1) is
selected essentially towards zero.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
in that
the detection (22, 24) of the start and/or end of
cornering of the vehicle takes place by means of

an evaluation of the sensed relative distance
between the vehicle body and the wheels, and/or
the start and/or end of cornering of the vehicle
is detected when the relative distances on the

right-hand and the left-hand sides of the vehicle
behave in opposition, and/or
the detection (22, 24) of the start and/or end of
cornering of the vehicle takes place by means of

an evaluation of the sensed steering angle of the
vehicle, and/or
the start and/or end of cornering of the vehicle
is detected by means of the switching position of

a steering-angle switch.
Device for carrying out the method according to
Claim 1, with a level-regulation control unit (7) and

level transmitter (4) for recording current values of
the relative distance between axle and vehicle body,

there being provided in the level-regulation control 
unit (7) first means (22, 23) by which the regulation

of a vehicle level is at least modified during
cornering of the vehicle, 
characterized in that
there are provided in the level-regulation control
unit (7) second means (26, 27) by which for

regulating the vehicle level outside cornering at
least two regulating modes (26, 27) are provided

which differ from one another at least in the
length of their regulation idle time (tau1, tau2),

and
there are provided in the level-regulation control
unit (7) third means (24, 25) by which after the

detection (22, 24) of the end of cornering of the
vehicle a regulation by means of the regulating

mode with the shorter regulation idle time (tau1)
takes place.
Device for carrying out the method according to
Claim 2, with a level-regulation control unit (7) and

level transmitter (4) for recording current values of
the relative distance between axle and vehicle body,

there being provided in the level-regulation control
unit (7) first means (22, 23) by which the regulation

of the vehicle level is at least modified during
cornering of the vehicle, 
characterized in that
there are provided in a level-regulation control
unit (7) second means (26, 27) by which for

regulating the vehicle level outside cornering at
least two regulating modes (26, 27) are provided

which differ from one another at least in the
length of their regulation idle time (tau1, tau2),

and
there are provided in a level-regulation control
unit (7) third means (24, 25) by which, after the

detection (22, 24) of the end of cornering of the
vehicle and after the detection of a specific

deviation from the desired value for the vehicle
level, a regulation by means of the regulating

takes place, there being provision, in particular, 

for the specific deviation detected to be a slant
of the vehicle body (25).
Device according to Claim 7 or 8, 
characterized
in that i
n that
 means (1) for detecting the steering
angle of the vehicle are provided.
