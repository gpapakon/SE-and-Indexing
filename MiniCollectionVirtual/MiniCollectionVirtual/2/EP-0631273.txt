<ABSTRACT>
Method for determining the most likely path through a stochastic network 
such as a Markov model, with various subnetworks such as network branches. 

Instead of tracing the best path from the end state (backtracing), there is 
detected in all cases for at least one state, through which of those different 

subnetworks runs the most likely path ending in that state, and this information 
is propagated through the network. It is possible to assign to each 

subnetwork an identification code which is representative of that subnetwork 
and which is passed through the network to the end state. The method can be 

used in particular in the recognition of speech or image signals and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for determining the most likely path
through a stochastic network having various states which are defined a priori
and can be reached with probabilities known a priori, such as a Markov model,
which network comprises various subnetworks, such as network branches,
each having one or more of such states. In particular, such methods are used
for the recognition of a priori unknown signal elements such as elements of a
speech or image signal, the subnetworks being mappings of various, a priori
known words or word elements (keywords). Recognition may be regarded as
classification into a priori known signal elements, to be carried out according
to a classification algorithm. Such a method is generally known and is
discussed, inter alia, in the dissertation mentioned under C1. There, all these
matters are discussed extensively, while reference is also made to other
relevant publications. In the American patent by IBM, mentioned under C2.,
reference is likewise made to a number of publications in this field. In
particular, the invention can be used for speech recognition; the invention
can, however, also be applied to related fields, for example to the field of
image recognition. Hereinafter it is assumed that the objective is to recognize
certain words in a speech signal, in other words that the executing system has
to determine which keyword a speech signal (speech utterance) corresponds
to.According to the prior art, an a priori unknown speech signal which
has to be recognized is first preprocessed in a so-called front-end. Such a 
front-end consists, for example, of a filter bank or an LPC analyser (LPC =
Linear Predictive Coding) and converts the signal fed in into a limited
number of so-called feature vectors. Such feature vectors are used as input for
the classification algorithm in which a check is performed whether the feature
vectors, with a certain probability, correspond to reference vectors which have
previously been derived from a priori known (speech) signal elements.
Incidentally, the feature vectors may or may not be converted (so-called
vector quantization) into discrete vectors, for example with the aid of a code
book; this then also takes place in the said front-end.According to the prior art, the feature vectors may be further
subjected to a stochastic process, in particular a Markov process (represented
by a Markov network model) in which a certain number of states (Sn) are
defined which, with certain probabilities, can be reached from previous states,
i.e.

Method according to Claim 1 CHARACTERIZED IN THAT there is
assigned a priori to each subnetwork at least one identification code which is

representative for that subnetwork and in that there is detected, at successive
moments, for at least one state, which is the identification code which belongs

to that most likely path ending in said state.
Method according to Claim 2, CHARACTERIZED IN THAT for the
identification code of a subnetwork the designation is used of at least one state

which forms part of that subnetwork.
Method for recognizing a priori unknown signal elements such as
elements of a speech or image signal, the most likely path through a stochastic

network having various subnetworks being determined according to Claim 1,
2 or 3, said subnetworks being mappings of various signal elements known a

priori, such as words or images.
