<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device in thermoforming, from a 
thermoplastic material sheet, an opening arrangement of the type which is 

formed into a pouring spout (7). 
In this instance, use is made of an outer closure portion (6), a screw 
cap, as mould in the thermoforming process. The device includes a forming 

tool (4) and a tube (5) for advancing the outer closure portion (6), and a 
spacer ring (9) lying outside the advancement tube (5), and manufactured 

from a resiliently yieldable material. In such instance, a neck (14) is created 
between the upper side (2) of the package and the outer closure portion (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device in thermoforming, from a 
thermoplastic material sheet, of a pouring spout which is intended to be 
surrounded by an outer closure portion, the device including a forming tool 
wherein the closure portion is included, and a tube for advancing the 
closure portion. The following method for thermoforming an opening arrangement is 
previously known from, for example, Swedish Patent Application No. SE-9100921-7. 
The method entails forming, from a sheet of thermoplastic 
material, a pouring spout which is surrounded by an outer closure portion, a 
so-called screw cap. The thermoplastic material sheet may comprise the entire upper side 
of a package which otherwise consists of a packaging laminate with a core 
of paper or paperboard to which are laminated different layers, of which the 
outermost is thermoplastic. The package may be of round or square cross 
section. The thermoplastic material sheet may also consist of a minor 
portion, covering a cut-out section from a conventional laminate package, 
so that it is fixedly welded in place against the inside of the laminate 
package consisting of thermoplastic material. Such a package may, for 
example, be a so-called gable top package. On one of the above package types which is finished inasmuch as it 
consists of side walls and an upper panel or wall, a pouring spout is formed 
in the upper panel. A forming tool is passed through the as yet uncompleted 
bottom of the package, and from the upper side of the package, an outer 
closure portion is lowered, this closure portion being a so-called screw cap 
which serves as a mould for forming the pouring spout. When the pouring 
spout has been formed in this manner, the upper portion of the pouring 
spout is fixedly sealed against the inside of the outer closure portion and, in 
such instance, the outer closure portion - the screw cap - may readily fasten 
to the plasticized thermoplastic sheet, so that opening of the package is 
impeded.  
 One object of the present invention is to make possible sealing of a 
pouring spout to an outer closure portion without the outer closure position 
fastening to the plasticized thermoplastic layer which constitutes the upper 
side of the package. A further object of the present invention is to create a 
space between the lower threads of the pouring spout and the upper side of 
the package. These and other objects have been attained according to the present 
invention in that the device of the type described by way of introduction has

<CLAIMS>
A device for thermoforming, from a thermoplastic material 
sheet, a pouring spout (7) which is intended to be surrounded 

by an outer closure portion (6), the device including 

a forming tool (4) and 
a tube (5) for advancing the closure portion (6), said closure 
portion (6) being included within said tube (5),
characterized in that
the lower region of said tube (5) is provided with an external 
spacer ring (9), said spacer ring (9) projecting in towards 

the centre of said tube (5). 
A device as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized in that 


said spacer ring (9) provides a neck (14) between the upper 
side (2) of a package and the outer closure portion (6). 
A device as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that 


said spacer ring (9) fixedly retains the outer closure portion 
(6) during the thermoforming process, thus prevents the 

fastening of the closure portion (6) onto the upper side (2) 
of the package. 
A device as claimed in one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that 


said spacer ring (9) is manufactured from a resiliently 
yieldable material. 
A device as claimed in claim 4,
 
characterized in that 


said spacer ring (9) is manufactured from rubber. 
A device as claimed in claim 5,
 
characterized in that 


said spacer ring (9) seals against said neck (14) during the 
thermoforming process. 
A device as claimed in one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that 


the spacer ring (9) constitutes a part of a tube (10) lying 
outside said tube (5). 
A device as claimed in claim 7,
 
characterized in that 


the innermost diameter of said spacer ring (9) is slightly 
less than the smallest diameter of said tube (5). 
A device as claimed in claim 7 or 8,
 
characterized in that 


said tube (5) is provided with a groove (12), extending 
circularly about said tube (5), in which a bead (11) being 

provided at said tube (10) of said spacer ring (9) rigidly 
engages.
