<ABSTRACT>
A security thread detector for verifying the authenticity of banknotes. In the preferred embodiment, the invention comprises a housing with a passage through which banknotes can be passed, wherein the housing also comprises a waveguide, a microwave oscillator for generating microwaves and two resonating slots on a wall of the waveguide, and a microwave detector. After a banknote is inserted through the passageway, the microwave diode produces an analog signal that is proportional to the microwave strength. The diode and the slots are arranged such that the radiated power from each slot is one hundred eighty degrees out-of-phase. If a banknote has no security thread, then the detector receives a balanced signal. If the banknote contains a security thread, the thread interferes with one of the radiating slots. This interference causes an imbalance condition and a corresponding signal is sent from the detector diode. The resulting signal is then sent to a microprocessor which activates an appropriate indicator. This indicator notifies the user of the presence or absence of a security thread; thus, the user can determine whether the banknote is counterfeit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to devices used to authenticate 
currency. More particularly, it relates to verification machines 
that detect security threads embedded in currency. The use of security threads embedded in currency paper 
has increased due to the advent of high-resolution, true-color 
photocopying machines. If modern currency does not have an 
embedded security thread, the currency can be more easily 
duplicated with a color photocopier. When the security thread is 
embedded, it is harder to illicitly reproduce. Unfortunately, it 
is also harder to verify by visual inspection. Consequently, 
various detectors have been invented. One such security thread verification device is described 
in U.S. Pat. No. 4980569 to Crane et al. This detector and others 
similar to it require the measurement of the thread properties in 
the presence of the printed currency paper. The physical 
properties of the security thread are different than the physical 
properties of the paper, yet they are difficult to measure due to 
the interference produced by the surrounding ink. WO-87/01845 discloses a method and an apparatus for 
checking the authenticity of documents, such as banknotes or 
credit cards. The documents comprise a number of randomly 
distributed conductive fibres of which the distribution is 
scanned by microwaves and the response is transformed into a 
digital coded signal. A digital mark on the document, which 
is representative for the distribution of an individual 
document, is read off, transcoded, and compared with said 
coded signal for producing an approval signal.  
 Detectors in the past have often included capacitors. 
Unfortunately, these devices are not as successful as originally 
anticipated. With these capacitor devices, the sensor has to come 
in contact with the paper immediate to the thread. If the sensor 
does not come into contact with the paper immediate to the thread, 
the sensor's ability to detect the thread is reduced, and sometimes 
nullified. Consequently, to ensure that the thread comes into 
contact with the sensor, the user or transport is forced to 
accurately place the currency through the detector. If the user or 
transport inaccurately places the currency such that the thread 
does not come into contact with the sensor, the detector does not 
detect the thread; therefore, it designates the currency as 
counterfeit. In addition, these capacitance devices are typically 
very slow in authenticating the presence or absence of the thread. 
This is undesirable in commercial

<CLAIMS>
A method of detecting the presence or absence of a security thread in a 
banknote which comprises: 


a. sensing the presence of a banknote (106); 
b. generating microwaves for passage through the banknote; 
c. producing with at least two resonant slots (180, 182) microwaves 
one hundred and eighty degrees out-of-phase which cancel each 

other to cause a balanced signal, the microwaves passing through 
the slots before passing through the banknote; 
d. detecting the balanced signal with a microwave detector disposed 
such that the resonant slots (180, 182) are opposite to and on either 

sides of the microwave detector; and 
e. determining whether a security thread (110) has interfered with any 
generated waves. 
A detecting method as recited in Claim 1, wherein the sensing step 
includes passing the note (106) by at least one photo sensor (174,176). 
A detecting method as recited in Claim 1 or 2, wherein the generating step 
includes oscillating microwaves. 
A detecting method as recited in any preceding claim, comprising the step 
of providing at least two slots having physical dimensions that direct the 

microwaves to propagate within an area that equals a portion of the physical 
dimensions of the security thread of a banknote to be verified. 
A detecting method as recited in Claim 4, wherein the determining step 
includes monitoring the phase of the waves which pass through the resonant slots.  

 
A device for verifying authenticity of currency paper and banknotes 
comprising: 


a. waveguide comprising a cavity; 
b. a passageway (104) in the waveguide adapted in size and shape to 
receive a banknote; 
c. a microprocessor (168); 
d. an oscillator (172) located inside the waveguide cavity, electrically

being detected by the detector; 
g. wherein a banknote can pass through the passageway adjacent to 
said slots in the wall of the waveguide; and 
h. wherein the slots are operative to produce microwaves one hundred 
and eighty degrees out-of-phase which cancel each other causing a 

balanced signal to be detected by the microwave detector until a 
security thread interferes with said microwaves and causes an 

imbalanced signal to be detected by the microwave detector, while 
the absence of a security thread does not interfere with the
