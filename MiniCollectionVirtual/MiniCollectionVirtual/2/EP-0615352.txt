<ABSTRACT>
In radio phone systems with a digital cellular design 
currently used a training sequence of constant length, 

consisting of an guard part and a reference part, is 
included in a transmission burst between a base station 

and a mobile station. With the aid of a received training 
sequence, the receiver calculates the impulse response of 

the channel and is thereafter adapted into the channel. 
The quality of the connection can, according to the 

invention, be enhanced in that the training sequence is 
made adaptive, whereby the lengths of the guard part and 

the reference part may vary while the total length of the 
training sequence remains the same. According to another 

embodiment, also the total length of the training sequence 
is changed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radio telephone system
provided with at least one base station and a plurality of
subscriber apparatus, and in which in a radio channel
between the base station and a subscriber apparatus a
training sequence is transmitted in a transmission burst,
according to which the receiver fits the channel equalizer
into the radio channel.Many information transmission problems in the radio phone
system involve time-variant or statistical sources of
signal degradation in a radio channel. Any transmission
channel, be it a transmission line or a radio channel,
affects the amplitude of the waveform, frequency or phase
of the signal, thus producing intersymbol inteference
among the bit pulses. In a mobile station, like a radio
phone in a car, the characteristics of the channel change
constantly over time. A general solution in digital
cellular systems known in the art is to use adaptive
channel correction. This means that certain distortion
characteristics of a channel are measured periodically or
continuously, and the predicted distortions in the
transmitted pulses are subtracted from the received
waveform. The system is capable of monitoring the quality
of the channel by measuring the bit error ratio and/or
other parameters, such as signal strength and delays.The subscriber device of the cellular system may be
depending on the system, a so-called mobile station, i.e.
mobile communicating equipment, having a radio channel
provided between the antenna thereof and a base station of 
the cellular system, or it may refer to a phone which is
connected to a remote transmitter/receiver by means of a
wire there being a radio channel provided between the
antenna of the remote transmitter/receiver and the antenna
of the base station. Reference is made below primarily to
mobile communicating equipment, though it is useful to
note that the same features are applicable to a subscriber
device falling within the latter definition as well. The
signal strength and the delay are substantially dependent
on the signal propagation distance between the base
station and the mobile station. As is well known in the
art, the transmission rate is high because of the
TDMA-transmission typically used in digital systems so
that the multiple-path propagation characteristic of the
radio path is visible in the reception not only in the
form of rapid so-called Rayleigh fading of the envelope of
the RF signal but also as an intersymbol interference
between the detected bits. In view of the intersymbol
interference,
