<ABSTRACT>
A method of having a frontside contact to a SOI wafer is 
described. Before any device processing steps a trench is 

etched through the SOI layers (24, 22, 20) to the substrate 
(20). This trench is maintained during device processing and 

opened during source/drain implantation. At metallization 
(30) an ohmic contact (28) is made to the substrate (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to device processing of 
Silicon-On-Insulator wafers, and more particularly, relates to 
a method of forming a frontside contact to the silicon 
substrate of a SOI wafer. SOI technology has been shown to have many advantages over 
bulk silicon technology. These advantages include higher 
speed, lower power and immunity to single event radiation 
upset. However, there are certain challenges encountered in 
actual product fabrication of silicon-on-insulator devices. 
One of these challenges is the need to bias or ground the 
silicon substrate. In many packaging processes, the substrate 
is in electrical contact with the package ground. Relying on 
this approach has several drawbacks such as extra processing 
must be done to the backside of the wafer to ensure a good 
electrical contact to the package. In some packaging 
techniques the silicon chip is flip chip bonded so that the 
substrate does not make contact with the package ground. In 
certain instances it is desirable to apply a bias to the 
substrate which is different than the package ground pin. The goals of alleviating the drawbacks of not grounding the 
substrate, providing for ease of contacting the substrate from 
the frontside of a SOI wafer, and allowing for biasing the 
substrate through the electrically isolating buried oxide 
layer has resulted in the present invention.  In accordance with the objects, features and advantages of the 
invention the following process can be used to provide a 
frontside contact to SOI wafers. 
1. Define substrate contact rings, and any other areas in 
which a substrate contact is desired. 2. Etch a trench in the exposed contact rings down to the 
substrate. 3. Strip the resist and resume standard processing. 4. Cover the substrate contact rings with photoresist when 
implanting a dopant of the opposite type from the 
substrate. 5. Open the contact ring during implantation, particularly 
source/drain implantation, when doping with a dopant of 
the same type as the substrate. 6. Resume standard processing to form the remainder of the 
device. The foregoing objects, features and advantages of the 
invention will be more fully understood with reference to the 
description of the best mode and the drawings wherein: 
Figure 1is a top plan view of the substrate contact. Figures 2a and bare cross sectional views of the etching of 
the contact. Figures 3a and bare cross sectional views of the doping
