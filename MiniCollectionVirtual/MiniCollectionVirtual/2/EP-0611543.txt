<ABSTRACT>
The device for cleaning ashtrays, which is shown in the drawing, has a free-standing housing (1) with the electric motor located in the top part (1a), together with dust filter (2) and also the infrared switch (6). The waste is conveyed into the container through the suction pipe (2). It is possible to introduce larger items of waste through the service flap (5). The service flap can be designed as a tilting or sliding device. The round brush (4) capable of being fitted onto the suction pipe can be designed to be fixed or rotating. The round brush can be caused to rotate by an electric motor or by the air intake flow of the suction cleaner. The suction cleaning apparatus is switched on by means of the infrared switch (6) located on the top part (1a).
