<DESCRIPTION>
The instant invention relates to a novel enzymatic process for the 
stereoselective preparation of chiral epoxide compounds from 
benzyopyran compounds. The instant invention thus relates to the 
stereoselective epoxidation or hydroxylation of benzopyran compounds to 
the chiral epoxide or the corresponding chiral mono or dihydroxy 
compounds. In accordance with the instant invention, a novel process is 
provided for preparing a chiral epoxide of formula 
and/or a (+)-trans dihydroxy compound of formula     As used in formula I and II and throughout the specification, the 
symbols have the following meanings:
 
   a, b, and d are all carbon atoms or one of a, b and d is a 
nitrogen atom or -NO- and the others are carbon atoms;
 
   R¹ and R² are independently hydrogen, alkyl or arylalkyl; or 
R¹ and R² taken together with the carbon atom to which they are attached 
form a 5- to 7-membered carbocyclic ring;
 
   R³ is hydrogen, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, 
cycloalkyl, arylalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, -CN, -NO₂, -COR, 
COOR, -CONHR, -CONRR', -CF₃, S-alkyl, -SOalkyl, -SO₂alkyl, 
halogen, amino, substituted amino, OH, 
-O-alkyl, -OCF₃, -OCH₂CF₃, -OCOalkyl, -OCONRalkyl, -NRCOalkyl, 
-NRCOOalkyl or -NRCONNR' wherein R and R' in each of the above 
groups is independently hydrogen, alkyl, haloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, 
cycloalkyl, or (cycloalkyl)alkyl;
 
   R⁴ is hydrogen, alkyl, -OH, -O-alkyl, amino, substituted 
amino, -NHCOR, -CN or -NO₂; and
 
   n is an integer of 1 to 3. The instant process comprises the step of treating a compound of 
formula 
with an enzyme or microorganism capable of catalyzing the 
stereoselective epoxidation of the compounds of formula III to form the  
 
chiral epoxide of formula I or the stereoselective hydroxylation to form the 
chiral dihydroxy compound of formula II. The invention also includes the process of preparing the 
trans-(+)-diols of the formula II, comprising the step of treating a racemic 
trans diol of formula 
with a lipase or esterase or microorganism capable of producing said 
lipase or esterase to resolve the racemic diols. The compounds of formula I are key intermediates in the 
preparation of compounds having potassium channel activating activity. 
The chiral dihydroxy compounds of formula II may be converted to the 
chiral epoxide of formula I, which may then be utilized to prepare 
compounds having potassium channel activating activity. The above process may also be used to form the chiral 
monohydroxy compounds of the formula
