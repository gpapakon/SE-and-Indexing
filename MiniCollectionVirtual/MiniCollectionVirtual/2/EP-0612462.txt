<ABSTRACT>
A device for stirring food while it is being microwave heated, comprises a stirrer (6) and means (2) for mounting the stirrer so that it can rotate freely through a limited angle about a vertical axis in use of the stirrer. Thus, when the turntable of the microwave oven starts to turn, the stirrer will rotate in one direction or the other, depending on the direction of turntable rotation, so that the stirrer adopts a position in which it deflects food into the centre of the container (7), the food being effectively stirred and reaching a uniform temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Microwave Stirring DeviceThis invention relates to a device for stirring food while it is being microwave heated.It has been found necessary to stir certain foods during microwave heating, thus spreading the heat evenly throughout the food. Without stirring, because microwaves do not penetrate more than 50mm into the food, the outside ends up much hotter than the centre. Therefore labels state, for example, "Microwave for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally". The only way to do this at present is to stop the microwave, stir by hand, then re-start the oven. This is inconvenient and prevents concentration on other jobs, and may result in food not being properly heated.The aim of the invention is to provide a simple device whereby food is automatically stirred while being microwave heated. There have been several attempts hitherto to provide such a device, but they have tended to be complicated, or difficult to clean, or both.According to the present invention, there is provided a device for stirring food while it is being microwave heated, said device comprising a stirrer, and means for mounting the stirrer so that it can rotate freely through a limited angle about a vertical axis, in use of the stirrer.An embodiment of this invention will now be described by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:Figure 1 is a perspective view of a flexible support frame of a stirring device, the frame fitting into the lower edges of the microwave oven and being shown with its holder raised; Figure 2 is a view which shows the device with the holder lowered and the stirrer located in a food container within a microwave oven;Figure 3 is a cross-section of the holder and stirrer shaft; Figure 4 shows some selected shapes of the stirrer blades; 

 Figure 5 shows an alternative form of holder for the stirrer; andFigure 6 is a diagrammatic plan view to show the manner in which the stirrer functions. Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a frame 1 that is resilient, allowing it to fit differing sizes of oven and being held in position in the oven by its springiness. This frame may be in one piece, or more than one for compact storage. The frame may have a different shape not here defined because there are many differing sizes and shapes of oven, and the shape of the frame is not important to the working of the device. Indeed, if the device were to be supplied as original equipment with a microwave oven, the frame may consist for example of a socketed arm or arms, or be for example a hinged

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS
1) A device for stirring food while it is being microwav heated, said device comprising a stirrer, and means fo mounting the stirrer so that it can rotate freely through limited angle about a vertical axis, in use of the stirrer.
2) A device as claimed in claim 1, in which the stirrer includes a shaft engaged or engageable with a holder in a manner permitting rotation of the stirrer through said limited angle about the axis of the shaft.
3) A device as claimed in claim 2 in which the holder is engaged or engageable with a support frame.
4) A device as claimed in claim 2, in which the holder is engageable with the roof of a microwave oven.
5) A device as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the stirrer is pivotable about a horizontal axis to lift it from an operative position within a food container.
6) A device as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the stirrer is disengageable from its mounting means.
7) A device for stirring food while it is being microwave heated, the device comprising a stirrer and means for mounting the stirrer so that, in use, it extends into a container of the food, the device being in combination with a frictional mat for preventing slippage between the container and a microwave oven turntable on which, in use, the container is placed.
