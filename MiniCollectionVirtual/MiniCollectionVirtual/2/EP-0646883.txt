<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gene database 
retrieval system and, more particularly, to a gene database 
retrieval system so adapted as to effectively execute 
an operation of the retrieval for a gene sequence and make 
retrieval for a sequence data of the gene sequence from 
a gene database having sequence data of at least either 
of sequences of bases of nucleic acids or sequences of 
amino acids of genes whose structures have already been 
analyzed, when the retrieval for the gene sequence is made 
using a gene sequence similar thereto as a candidate for 
extracting a sequence data of the gene sequence from the 
gene database. There has currently been made active research 
and development work for the purpose to analyze characteristics 
of animal and plant species at gene levels, such 
as represented by human genome project and rice plant 
genome project. Such research and development activities 
are based on the understanding that expression and 
generation of functions, useful for the human being, in 
and from another biological body can be realized by the 
established gene recombinant technology and that each of 
the characteristics of such an organism can correspond to 
a sequence at gene levels. Hitherto, the structures of gene sequences of 
some organisms have been analyzed and information of the 
resultant gene sequences has already been registered in 
databases for common use. General researchers can make 
access to such databases and utilize the information of 
the gene sequences registered therein. Such databases  
 
include, for example, GenBank in the U. S., EMBL in 
Europe, Gene Database at National Gene Institute of Japan, 
and so on. In the description of this specification, the 
term "gene" referred to herein is intended to mean a 
sequence of bases of a nucleic acid having information of 
a gene of an organism or a sequence of bases of amino 
acids in combination with the sequence of the bases of 
such a nucleic acid, unless otherwise stated herein. The retrieval for gene sequences from the gene 
database is performed with the purposes to assume the 
functions in the living body of the gene sequences 
determined experimentally by researchers; to form a 
genetic cladogram by grouping the living bodies having the 
homologous sequences; or to determine whether the 
structure and the genetic information of the gene sequence 
determined experimentally by the researcher have already 
been discovered. A description will now be made of an example of 
operations for the retrieval of a
