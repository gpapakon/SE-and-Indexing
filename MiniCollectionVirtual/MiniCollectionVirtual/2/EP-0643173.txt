<ABSTRACT>
There is proposed a road traffic warning sign (10) with a signalling means (12), especially a warning and/or flashing light, attached to the warning-sign head (11), as well as a substantially one-piece warning-sign body (13) composed of plastic, at the vertically upper end (11) of which the signalling means (12) is arranged, as well as a power supply device (14) which supplies the signalling means (12). The power supply device (14) which supplies the signalling means (12) is accommodated in the warning-sign body (13).

<CLAIMS>
Road traffic signal (10) having a signal means (12), in particular a warning light and/or
flashing light, mounted on the signal head (11), and having a one-piece signal body

(13) which consists of plastic and at whose vertically upper end the signal means (12)
are arranged, and having a voltage supply device (14) for operating the road traffic

signal (10), whereby the voltage supply device (14) supplying the signal means (12) is
accommodated in the signal body (13) in such a way that it can be releasably inserted

into the signal body (13), characterized in that the voltage supply device (14) has a

device (23) for releasable locking to the signal body (13).
Road traffic signal according to Claim 1, characterized in that the signal body (13) is of
substantially hollow configuration and the voltage supply device (14) is accommodated

in the hollow space (15).
Road traffic signal according to one or both of Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that
the voltage supply device (14) can be releasably inserted into the signal body (13) from

its vertically lower end (16).
Road traffic signal according to one or both of Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that
the voltage supply device (14) can be releasably inserted laterally (17) into the signal

body (13).
Road traffic signal according to Claim 4, characterized in that the signal body (13) has,
in the region of the inlet opening (18) for the voltage supply device (14), a slotted

configuration of such a nature that the region of the signal body (13) covering the inlet
opening (18) can be at least partially folded down.
Road traffic signal according to one or more of Claim 1 to 5, characterized in that the
signal body (13), which can be releasably connected to a signal base (20) by means of a

column (19), can be tipped by means of a linkage connection formed in the column
(19). 
Road traffic signal according to one or more of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the
column (19), by means of which the signal body (13) is releasably connected to a column

base (20), can be secured by a securing means (21) in an end position inserted
into the signal base (20).
Road traffic signal according to one or more of Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the
voltage supply device (14) is accommodated in a casing (22).
Road traffic signal according to Claim 8, characterized in that the device (23) for the
releasable locking of the casing (22) to the signal body (13) is provided on the casing

(22) of the voltage supply device (14).
Road traffic signal according to one or more of Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the
voltage supply device (14) is substantially composed of at least one rechargeable accumulator.
Road traffic signal according to one or more of Claims 1 to 10, characterized in that
the voltage supply device (14) is composed of at least one network part for connection

to a voltage supply network.
Road traffic signal according to one or more of Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the
voltage supply device (14) is substantially composed of at least one primary cell.
