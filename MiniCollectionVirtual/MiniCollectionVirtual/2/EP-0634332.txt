<ABSTRACT>
In a tray or similar box of the ready-to-use type which can be 
made from a blank by folding and adhesion, where the corner 

connections between upright walls are such that, while the 
connection is being maintained, the upright walls can be 

collapsed over the bottom panel, according to the invention, 
two opposite upright walls (8,9) are connected with a bottom panel 

through a swivel panel (12,13) and an intermediate panel (10,11) which 
has a 

width substantially equal to half the bottom width as measured 
between the corresponding opposite bottom folding lines. By 

means of the swivel panels the intermediate panel can be 
placed under or on top of the bottom panel (1) in such a manner 

that the relevant upright walls come to lie directly against 
the bottom panel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tray or similar box, which 
can be made from a blank by folding and adhesion, comprising a 
bottom panel and upright walls connected thereto through four 
folding lines bounding the bottom panel, wherein at the 
location of the bottom corners where upright walls meet, in 
one of the upright walls a triangular connecting zone is 
bounded, which, after being folded back, as viewed from the 
inside of the box, against the outside of this upright wall, 
is connected to the other upright wall with interposition of a 
connecting flap hingedly connected with one of the upright 
walls. Such trays, which are of the so-called ready-to-use type, 
are well known. By 'ready-to-use type' is meant that, by 
virtue of the specific corner connection, the upright walls of 
the tray, already connected to each other, can be collapsed 
onto the bottom of the box, so that the finished tray can be 
stored without occupying much space. To make the tray ready 
for use, only the collapsed walls need to be erected and the 
tray is ready for receiving objects. Also well known, in 
addition to ready-to-use trays, are set-up trays, which can 
also be formed from a blank but require a number of operations 
to be performed for making them ready for use, such as the 
separate erection of the sidewalls and the effectuation of 
corner connections through stapling, glueing, by slipping 
locking tabs in one upright wall into receiving openings in 
the other upright wall, or other operations for which 
typically no time is available after the vegetables or fruits 
to be packaged have been harvested. If set-up trays are 
supplied in ready-to-use condition, they take up a great deal 
of space. Dutch laid-open patent application no. 8900888 discloses 
a box of the type described in the preamble, where the bottom 
panel, at two opposite folding lines bounding the bottom 
panel, is connected with the corresponding walls by two  
 
intermediate panels which, in the finished box, are adhered to 
each other and against the bottom panel. By virtue of this feature, the vertical loadability is 
improved, in particular in the case of a stack of boxes or 
trays, in that in the edge zones of the tray directly adjacent 
to the upright walls, where, in the case of a stack, the 
vertical forces are transmitted, the bending strength is 
increased. Because the above feature involves the bottom panel 
locally acquiring a triple layer thickness along two upright 
walls, the resistance to sagging of the bottom has already 
been

<CLAIMS>
A tray or similar box, which can be made from a blank by 
folding and adhesion, comprising a bottom panel (1) and 

upright walls (6-9) connected thereto through four folding 
lines (2-5) bounding the bottom panel (1), wherein at the 

location of the bottom corners where upright walls (6-9) meet, 
in one of the upright walls (6, 7) a triangular connecting 

zone (20) is bounded, which, after being folded back, as 
viewed from the inside of the box, against the outside of this 

upright wall (6, 7), is connected to the other upright wall 
(8, 9) with interposition of a connecting flap (26-29) 

hingedly connected with one of the upright walls (6-9), 
characterized in that the bottom panel (1), at two opposite 

folding lines (4, 5) bounding the bottom panel, is connected 
to the corresponding upright walls (8, 9) through a swivel 

panel (12, 13) and an intermediate panel (10, 11) which has a 
width substantially equal to half the bottom width as measured 

between said opposite bottom folding lines (4, 5), the swivel 
panel (12, 13) which connects the intermediate panel (10, 11) 

with the bottom panel (1) being connected to the intermediate 
panel (10, 11) and the bottom panel (1) through two folding 

lines (4, 16; 5, 17) which are parallel to each other and to 
the corresponding bottom folding line (4, 5), and which are 

shorter than the length of that bottom folding line (4, 5), 
the first substantially coinciding with the corresponding 

bottom folding line (4, 5) and the second (16, 17) being 
laterally displaced over substantially half the width of the 

intermediate panel (10, 11). 
A tray according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
swivel panels (12, 13) separated between the assemblies of 

parallel folding lines (4, 16; 5, 17) are arranged 
symmetrically relative to the central plane of the tray 

extending transversely to the intermediate panels (10, 11). 
A tray according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the connecting flaps (26-29) are made up of corner support 

panels (34a-e, 35a-e, 36a-e, 37a-e) interconnected through 

 
parallel folding lines (30a-d, 31a-d, 32a-d, 33a-d), which 

corner support panels (34a-e, 35a-e, 36a-e, 37a-e), after 
folding and adhesion, can be formed into crush-resistant 

corner supports with a connecting flap portion (34e+d, 35e+d, 
36e+d, 37e+d) by which the above-described corner connection 

for a ready-to-use tray with the adjacent upright wall can be 
effected. 
A tray according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
assembly of corner support panels interconnected through 

parallel folding lines is designed with a length substantially 
equal to the sum of the widths of an intermediate panel 

(10, 11) and an upright wall panel (8, 9), this assembly being 
located in line with the upright walls (6, 7) which are 

connected directly to the bottom panel (1) without 
intermediate panel. 
A tray according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the connecting flaps (26-29) have 

substantially the same height as the upright walls 
(6, 7; 8, 9).
