<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reverse conducting gate
turn-off thyristor (RC-GTO) structure in which a gate turn-off
thyristor (GTO) and a reverse current diode (RCD) are formed on
the same substrate.A conventional reverse conducting gate turn-off
thyristor will be described with reference to Fig. 6, which is a
sectional view showing the essential part of a conventional
reverse conducting gate turn-off thyristor.In Fig. 6, a GTO section a consists of an anode
emitter layer (pE layer) 1, an anode base layer (nB layer) 2, a
cathode base layer (pB layer) 3, and a cathode emitter layer (nE
layer) 4. The anode base layer 2 is formed as an anode short
structure due to an anode emitter short-circuiting layer (n+
layer) 5 having a high impurity concentration.In Fig. 6, the RCD section b consists of an anode base
layer (pB layer) 3' which is common to the cathode base layer 3
of the GTO section a, a cathode base layer (nB layer) 2' which
forms a part of the same layer as the anode base layer 2 of the
GTO section a, and an n+ type cathode layer 6.Further, in Fig. 6, numeral 7 indicates an anode
electrode provided for both the anode of the GTO section a and
the cathode of the RCD section b; numeral 8 indicates a gate
electrode provided on the cathode base layer 3 of the GTO
section a; numeral 9 indicates a cathode electrode provided on
the cathode emitter layer 4 of the GTO section a; and numeral 10 
indicates an anode electrode provided on the anode base layer 3'
of the RCD section b. The cathode electrode 9 of the GTO
section a and the anode electrode 10 of the RCD section b are
kept in contact with each other through a pressure contact
electrode plate (not shown) arranged on the electrodes 9 and 10,
so that they are at the same electrical potential.An isolation region c is provided between the GTO
section a and the RCD section b. An isolation groove 11 for
electrically isolating the cathode base layer 3 of the GTO
section a from the anode base layer 3' of the RCD section b is
provided in the isolation region c. Thus, due to the presence
of the isolation groove 11, short-circuiting through the anode
base layer 3' of the RCD section b, which occurs when a reverse
bias voltage is applied between the gate electrode 8 and the
cathode electrode 9 of the GTO section a, is prevented.Conventionally, to electrically isolate the cathode
base layer 3 of the GTO section a from the anode base layer 3'
of the RCD section b, the isolation groove 11 is provided with a
broad width, thereby enhancing the isolation resistance (RGK)
