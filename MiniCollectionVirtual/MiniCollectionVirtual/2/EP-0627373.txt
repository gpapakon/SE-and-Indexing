<ABSTRACT>
The pick-up device possesses, for picking up an article (7), a pick-up table (2) with conveyor band (4), a throw-on member (8) and a stay head (11). During the picking-up operation, a pressure element (13) of the stay head (11) is pressed onto the rear part of the top side of the article. The throw-on member (8) is simultaneously pressed from the front onto the article below the front top edge. The throw-on member is then moved upwards under constant pressure. The article is thereby tilted about the axis of articulation (14) of the pressure element (13). The tilting movement produces an orifice under the front lower edge (18) of the article, into which orifice the pick-up table (2) can be introduced. The latter then moves under the article with the oppositely rotating conveyor band and loads this. The throw-on member (8) is simultaneously retracted. By virtue of this pick-up procedure, even rigid package-like articles can be grasped, without room for outward pivoting being necessary behind the article. The method is therefore suitable especially for picking up a plurality of articles arranged in succession.

Method for picking up articles (7) by means of 
a pick-up device, wherein the pick-up device comprises a 

receiving table (2), which can be extended along a direction 
of extension against the article (7), in which 

method the article (7) is rotated about a horizontal axis 
of rotation, which is located in a upper rear area (17) 

of the article (7), such that the bottom of the article 
(7) is lifted in a forward area, whereupon the receiving 

table is extended at least partially below the article 
(7) for pick-up, characterised in that a lifting me
mber 
(8, 8') of the pick-up device is extended against the article 

(7) and brought into contact at a contact surface 
in a forward upper area of the article, whereupon a force 

with upward directed vertical component is exerted onto 
the article (7) by means of the lifting member (8, 8') 

and the article is tilted about the axis of rotation. 
Method of claim 1 characterised in that during 
tilting a yielding of the article (7) in the direction of 

extension is substantially prevented by second article 
located behind the article or by a holding member (30) 

brought behind the article. 
Method of one of the preceding claims characterised 
in that during tilting an pushing member (13) is 

abutting on an upper rear area of the article (17). 
Method of claim 3 characterised in that the 
pushing member (13) exerts a downward directed force onto 

the article (7) and that the surface of the pushing member 
(13), of the article (7) and of a support of the article 

as well as the downward directed force of the pushing 
member (13) and the weight force of the article (7) 

are adjusted such that the maximum horizontal static 
friction between the article (7) and the pushing member  

 
(13) is larger than the one between the article (7) and 

the support. 
Method of one of the claims 3 or 4 characterised 
in that a tilting axis (14) is provided in the pushing 

member (13), which forms the axis of rotation for 
tilting the article. 
Method of one of the claims 3 - 5 characterised 
in that the pushing member (13) is pushed with a substantially 

constant force against the article (7) while tilting 
the article (7). 
Method of one of the preceding claims characterised 
in that during tilting the article (7) the lifting 

member (8, 8') is pushed against the article (7) with 
a substantially constant force. 
Pick-up device for carrying out the method of 
one of the preceding claims with a receiving table (2) 

extendible along a pick-up direction (6), characterised 
in that it comprises a lifting member (8, 8'), which is 

arranged higher than the receiving table (2), extendible 
along the pick-up direction (6) and designed for exerting 

a force with upward directed vertical component for tilting 
the article (7) about a horizontal rotation axis in a 

upper rear area (17) of the article (7) and thereby for 
lifting the bottom of the article (7) in a forward area. 
Pick-up device of claim 8 characterised in that 
the lifting member (8, 8') can be displaced in vertical 

direction. 
Pick-up member of one of the claims 8 or 9 
characterised in that the lifting member (8, 8') comprises 

a first pushing drive (9) by means of which it can 
be pushed into the pick-up direction with a given force. 
Pick-up device of one of the claims 8 - 10 
characterised in that it comprises a counterhold head 

(11, 11'), which can be lowered from above onto the article 
to be picked up (7). 
Pick-up device of claim 11, characterised in 
that the counterhold head (11, 11') comprises a pushing  

 
member (13) for contacting the article to be picked up, 

which pushing member is tiltable about a horizontal axis 
(14). 
Pick-up device of one of the claims 11 or 12 
characterised in that the counterhold head (11, 11') comprises 

a holding member (30) which can be extended downward 
for lowering behind the article (7) to be picked up. 
Pick-up device of one of the claims 11 - 13 
characterised in that the counterhold head (11, 11') comprises 

a second pushing drive (28), by means of which it 
can be pressed from above with a given force onto the article 

(7) to be picked up. 
Pick-up device of one of the claims 11 - 14 
characterised in that the counterhold head (11) and the 

lifting member (8) can be displaced together in vertical 
direction. 
Pick-up device of one of the claims 8 - 15 
characterised in that the receiving table (2) comprises a 

transport device, especially a transport belt (4), by 
means of which the article (7) to be picked up can be 

moved over the receiving table (2).
