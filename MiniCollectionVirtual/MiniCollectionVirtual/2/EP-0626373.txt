<ABSTRACT>
This invention is to provide quinazolinone 
derivatives, and their acid salts and quaternary ammonium 

salts, having an effect of preventing or treating 
diseases caused by calcium ion overload in cells, such 

as ischemic heart disease, ischemic cerebral disease and 
ischemic renal disease, and their usage. The quinazolinone 

derivatives are represented by the formula: 

typically, T represents an oxygen atom; Y represents a 
phenyl or cyclohexyl group; R¹ represents a hydrogen or 

chlorine atom; R² represents a hydrogen atom; ring W 
represents a benzene or pyridine ring; Z represents a 

group of the formula:

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to quinazolinone
derivatives, their acid-addition salts or their quaternary
ammonium salts, having an effect of preventing overload
of calcium ions (Ca2+) in cells, as well as their usages.Overload of calcium ions (Ca2+) in cells has
been regarded as an important matter in the cell injury
mechanism after ischemia or reperfusion. See, for
example, Annu. Rev. Physiol., 1990, 52, 543-559. Cell
injuries caused by ischemia or reperfusion are observed
in many diseases routinely encountered, and those in
heart, brain and kidney, among others, are serious
problems experienced clinically. Thus, an agent preventing
overload of calcium ions could be a useful preventing
or treating agent for ischemic heart disease, ischemic
cerebral disease and ischemic renal disease.Heretofore, a calcium antagonist has been used
as an agent for preventing the influx of calcium ions
into myocardial cells or blood vessel smooth muscle cells.
However, its effect on the overload of calcium ions in
myocardial cells after ischemia or reperfusion is not
satisfactory. Thus, an agent for preventing the calcium
overload has been keenly desired.Calcium ion overload induces injuries in
myocardial cells or smooth muscle cells, such as
disorders, not only in case of ischemia, but in the
contraction and relaxation function and in the energy
metabolism, as well as morphological damage and electro-physiological
disorder, thus causing diseases in the 
circulatory organs. See, for example, Cardionvasc. Res.,
1986, 20, 645-651. Accordingly, an agent for preventing
calcium ion overload could be a useful preventing or
treating agent for circulatory diseases, such as heart
failure, hypertension and arrhythmia.An object of the invention is to provide for a
group of compounds which prevents overload of calcium ions
in cells. Other objects will be apparent from the
following descriptions.After extensive studies to solve the problems
encountered in the past, the present inventors have found
that compounds represented by the following formula (1)
prevent the occurrence of calcium ion overload in cells,
and accomplished the present invention based on such
findings.Thus, the invention relates to a calcium ion
overload preventing agent containing a pharmaceutically
effective amount of a quinazolinone derivative represented
by the formula (1):

wherein T represents an oxygen or sulfur atom; Y
represents an alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, phenyl,
substituted phenyl, aralkyl, substituted aralkyl, heteroaryl 
aryl or substituted
