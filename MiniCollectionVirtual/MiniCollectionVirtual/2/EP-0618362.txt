system, in particular a high-pressure 

cleaning system, comprising

which the operating fluid whose pressure is to be raised 
can be fed and the delivery connection (7) of which is 

connected to a non-return valve (13), the outlet side 
(13a) of which is connected to the pressure outlet (12) 

of the system, from where the operating fluid can be 
taken at high pressure,

adjusted during operation, the inlet (20) of which is 

connected to the delivery connection (7), the outlet (22) 
of which is connected to the inlet connection (6) and the 

control inlet (21) of which is connected to the outlet 
side (13a) of the non-return valve (13), 
and a pressure switch (26) with a large ON/OFF switching 
difference, via which the motor is connected to the mains 

and which contains a first cylinder/piston arrangement 
(27) which is connected to the outlet side (13a) of the 

non-return valve (13) and whose piston rod (32) can be 
brought to rest against an intermediate member (35) which 

is mounted movably in the switch frame (28), is preloaded 
towards a first limit position by a first spring (36) and

in the unpressurized state of the cylinder/piston arrangement  

 
(27), towards the second limit position, the 

intermediate member (35) moving the contact carrier (38) 
from its ON position into an OFF position, and, during a 

movement in the opposite direction effected by the force 
of the first spring (36) counter to the opposing force of 

the cylinder/piston arrangement, the intermediate member 
(35) moving the contact carrier into the ON position at 

a first lower pressure (p- 1a) before the first limit 
position is reached, 
and, starting from a position determined by the first 
cylinder/piston arrangement (27), the intermediate member 

(35) being movable further in the direction of its second 
limit position by an external force (N), having only to 

overcome the sum of the spring forces of the first spring 
(36) and the snap-action arrangement (37),

third lower pressure (p-3a) and comes to rest against an 
outer stop (60) at a slightly higher, third upper pressure

position, situated outside the path of motion of the 
intermediate member (35), into an active limit position,

move to its second limit position and with a force (N) 
sufficient to overcome the spring forces acting on the 

member, and

its active limit position only when the second
