<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for feeding a mat of disintegrated lignocellulose-containing 
material into a press with continuously driven 

lower and, respectively upper press belts (6,9) for the manufacture 
of board, such as particle board, fiberboard etc. The 

arrangement comprises a conveyor with a movable nose portion 
(5) extending into the nip between the press belts (6,9). A 

mechanism (4) is provided for moving the nose portion (5) along 
a fixed roll surface (7), the geometry of which corresponds to 

the geometry in the press nip, so that the distance of the nose 
portion (5) to the lower press belt (6) is maintained substantially 

constant at the movement of the nose portion (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an arrangement for feeding a mat of 
disintegrated lignocellulose-containing fiber material into 
a press comprising continuously driven lower and, respectively, 
upper press belts for the manufacture of board, such as particle 
board, fiberboard etc. The manufacture of board based on lignocellulose according to 
the dry method is carried out in known manner by disintegrating 
the lignocellulose-containing raw material to a suitable form, 
drying and glueing it, form it to a material mat which is pre-pressed 
and transported to a hot press, which can be a 
discontinous or continuous press where the material mat is compressed 
and the glue by the influence of heat hardens and gives 
the resulting board the strength required. Board types manufactured in principle in this way are particle 
board, fiberboard and other board. Medium Density Fiberboard (MDF) and similar fiberboard with varying 
density are board types, which in recent years have been 
used to a rapidly increasing extent, and which are based on 
lignocellulose-containing raw material defibered to fibers. The 
material mat thus obtained is almost exclusively a so-called 
single-layer board, i.e. it has a substantially homogenous 
structure with uniform fiber distribution, and the mat has a 
considerable thickness after forming, but also after pre-pressing 
and at the transport into the hot press. Particle board at present is built up mostly as three-layer 
board, i.e. it comprises a central layer with coarse chips and 
two surface layers with fine chips. As these surface layers are 
made separately, the possibility is used to choose different 
moisture content and glue content in the layers, The fiber mat 
at the use of chips is not as thick as at MDF.  
 At the introduction of a material mat of the said or similar 
kind into the inlet of a continuous press, the material mat is 
exposed to heat from the hot upper steel belt in the hot press, 
and at the inlet to the press nip it is subjected to a reduction 
in thickness, which implies a.o. that air included in the material 
mat rapidly must be evacuated out of the material mat. The material mat, thus, is not exposed symmetrically to the hot 
steel belts, because the lower surface of the mat is protected 
by its conveyor all the way to the take-off occasion. Arrangements 
to protect the upper surface of the mat against radiation 
heat from the hot upper steel belt are known, but have practical 
disadvantages, such as the risk of accumulation of chips/fibers, 
which can
