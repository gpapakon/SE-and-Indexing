<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus for processing information by 
executing a selected operation selected from a plurality 

of processing operations, a detecting arrangement (11) 
detects a selected position in a predetermined area 

having a first and a second area and produces a 
coordinate value representative of the selected position. 

A display unit (12) is placed in the first area. An 
operation selecting portion (14) is placed in the second 

area. When the selected position is on the display unit, 
a processing unit (17) makes the display unit display an 

image with reference to the coordinate value. When the 
selected position is on the operation selecting portion, 

the processing unit selects, as the selected operation, 
one of the processing operations in accordance with the 

coordinate value. It is preferable that a digitizer is 
used as the detecting arrangement for detecting the 

selected position in accordance with a predetermined 
electric wave emitted from a stylus pen (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an information 
processing apparatus having various functions and, in 
particular, to an information processing apparatus for 
processing information by executing, as a selected 
operation, one selected from a plurality of processing 
operations which are for performing the various 
functions, respectively. In a conventional information processing 
apparatus of the type described, a stylus pen is often 
used instead of a keyboard or a mouse to enter characters 
or numerals handwritten by an operator and to select, as 
the selected operation, one from the processing 
operations. Such an information processing apparatus 
comprises a digitizer and a liquid crystal display unit 
located on an upper surface of the digitizer. The liquid 
crystal display unit has an image display area 
substantially equal to that of the digitizer. When the 
stylus pen indicates a selected position of the image 
display area on the liquid crystal display unit, the  
 
digitizer detects the selected position to produce a 
coordinate value representative of the selected position 
in the manner known in the art. With reference to the 
coordinate value, the information processing apparatus 
processes information by executing the selected operation 
that is selected from the processing operations. However, it is difficult in the information 
processing apparatus to display a reverse video on the 
liquid crystal display unit and to carry out any inherent 
processing operation of hardware, such as a reboot 
operation known in the art. This is because the 
information processing apparatus is not provided with any 
keyboard in its standard model. Particularly, in case where the selected 
operation is selected from the processing operations 
during execution of application software, it is necessary 
to repeat a plurality of times an operation of the stylus 
pen in the image display area on the liquid crystal 
display unit in order to open and close a file known in 
the art. This results in a less operability in selecting 
the selected operation from the processing operations. It is therefore an object of this invention to 
provide an information processing apparatus wherein 
access to the operations inherent to the hardware is 
readily available. It is another object of this invention to provide 
the information processing apparatus of the type in  
 
which, in case where selection of the selected operation 
from the processing operations is performed during 
execution of the application software, such selection
