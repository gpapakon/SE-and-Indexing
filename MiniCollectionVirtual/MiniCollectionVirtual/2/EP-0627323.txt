<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet
recording apparatus and an ink jet recording method
capable of recording the half-tone image in such a
manner as to change the number of recording dots per
unit area, as well as recorded matters.In the conventional ink jet recording
methods, the recording is performed in such a manner
as to discharge the ink through a plurality of
discharge orifices formed in a recording head in
accordance with data signal and attach ink droplets
onto the recording medium such as a paper. This
recording method has been utilized for printers,
facsimile apparatus or copying machines, for
example.For the above apparatuses, there is a method
involving the use of electricity-heat energy
converters in which heat generating elements
(electrothermal energy converters or electricity-heat
energy converters) are provided in the neighborhood
of discharge orifices to discharge the ink and apply 
an electrical signal to those heat generating
elements to heat the ink locally, thus causing a
pressure change therein to discharge the ink through
discharge orifices, or the use of electromechanical
converters such as piezo-electrical elements.In this type of recording method, the half-tone
recording is controlled in accordance with a dot
density control method in which the half-tone is
represented by controlling the number of recording
dots per unit area with the recording dot of fixed
size, or a dot diameter control method in which the
half-tone is represented by controlling the size of
recording dots.Herein, the latter dot diameter control
method has some restrictions because of its complex
control required to minutely change the size of
recording dot, and therefore the former dot density
control method is generally employed.When the electricity-heat energy converters
are used as ink discharge means, they can be easily
manufactured and allows for the high density, and
thus the high resolution, but has the difficulty in
controlling the amount of pressure change, so that
the diameter of recording dot can not be readily
modulated. Hence, the dot density control method is
mainly employed for the half-tone recording with the
ink jet recording method. Typical of the binarization method for the
half-tone representation for use with this dot
density control method is an organizational dither
method, but this method has a problem that the number
of gradations is limited by the matrix size. That
is, to increase the number of gradations requires to
increase the matrix size, but there is a problem that
