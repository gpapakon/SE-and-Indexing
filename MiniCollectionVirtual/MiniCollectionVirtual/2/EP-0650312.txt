<ABSTRACT>
An improved energizing circuit for starting and 
regulating a gaseous discharge lamp. The circuit is 

100% solid state and does not require the use of any 
inductive components or any fil aments for its proper 

operation. The circuit is made up of several subcircuits 
including a rectifying/voltage-doubling circuit, 

a second multiplying circuit, a low power oscillating 
circuit and a high voltage amplifier circuit. A high 

frequency AC signal is used to ionize the gas and 
ignite the lamp, while a DC signal is generated by the 

circuit to keep the lamp illuminated once it is 
ignited. The size and weight of the integrated circuit 

ballast are such that it could be incorporated into 
the fluorescent lamp package itself.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an energizing
circuit used for fluorescent lamps and, more
specifically, to a ballast circuit which ionizes the
gas within a fluorescent lamp without the use of
filaments or inductive components.Ballast circuits are used in fluorescent lamp systems
to regulate the current supply to the lamp. Without a
ballast, a fluorescent lamp would burn out instantly
because there would be no impedance to limit the
current; noting in particular that once the lamp is
ignited and the gas within is ionized, the impedance
across the lamp drops dramatically. Additional functions
of a ballast circuit include providing the
proper voltage to start a fluorescent lamp and reducing
such voltage to maintain the lamp in a stable and
lit condition.The vast majority of ballast circuits in this wellknown
field of art all rely on the use of filaments
which release free electrons into the tube (either by
thermoionic emission, field emission or a combination
of both) and ionize the gas within the lamp. Since
these ballasts rely on the use of filaments to ionize
the gas within the lamp, such systems limit the life
of any given fluorescent light to the life of its
filaments. Thus, after a filament burns out the entire
lamp must be discarded. Aside from having to continually
replace these lamps, the refuse generated by
discarding "burnt-off" lamps presents a serious 
ecological problem. These lamps contain heavy metal
elements (e.g. mercury) which are extremely dangerous
to the environment and very costly to handle during
the disposal process.Although it is known in the prior art that a lamp can
be lit without the use of filament (e.g. see Summa,
U.S. Patent No. 4,066,930, column 5), such circuits
are extremely expensive. For example, the Summa
circuit requires the use of very specialized, and
therefore very expensive, transformer components which
strictly limit its application to high radio-frequency
guns used to test fluorescent lamps at the factory. The circuit disclosed in FR-A-2645393 is principally attempting to tackle the
problem of mercury migration common in DC ballast, by incorporating the polarity
switching element "D." The actual ballast is quite inefficient since the current
limitation is provided by resistors (see R1 and R2 in Fig. 1), and additionally the
voltage multiplying stages in Fig. 1 continue to consume power even after the
lamp is ignited. The circuit likewise does not disclose or even suggest using an
oscillator to provide an ignition signal, and hence one can deduce it
