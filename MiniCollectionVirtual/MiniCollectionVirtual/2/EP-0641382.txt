Process for the continuous preparation of a sterile nutrient 
medium, in which different medium components are 

mixed to form a medium stream which is suitable for feeding 
to a bioreactor,
characterised in that
 the medium 
components are mixed together prior to sterilization, the 

medium stream thus formed is fed to a cross-flow filtration 
module which is provided with a filtration membrane 

through which the medium stream is split up into permeate 
and retentate, whereby the retentate is sent to a centrifuge 

for removal of the bacteria and the centrifuged retentate 
is recycled back into the medium stream to the 

cross-flow filtration module and the permeate is fed to 
the bioreactor. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
temperature of the medium stream is adjusted to a temperature 

of at least 70 Â°C by means of a heat exchanger after 
the retentate has been added. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the pore diameter of the filtration membrane does not 

exceed 0.2 micrometers.  
 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the pore diameter of the filtration membrane is 0.14 

micrometers. 
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the flow volume of the retentate is at least 

equal to the flow volume of the permeate. 
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the flow volume of the retentate is four 

times greater than the flow volume of the permeate. 
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that the dosing of the medium components is by 

means of positive displacement pumps. 
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterised 
in that the discharge pressure of the centrifuge 

is kept constant by regulating the flow volume of one component. 
Process according to claim 8, characterised in that the 
flow volumes of the other medium components are adjusted 

to the changed flow volume of the regulated medium components.
