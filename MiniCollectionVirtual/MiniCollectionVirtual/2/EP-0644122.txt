<ABSTRACT>
This invention refers to an anti-bending stepping system 
for metallic containers (1) which can be applied to all kind 

of metallic containers of a shape that can be either 
trunco-pyramidal, parallelopipedic, elliptical or similar 

to correct the usual bending produced when the body of 
the container (1) is expanded, and it comprises two or more 

steps (3) on certain areas of the side wall of the body of 
the container, the number of steps and their depth 

depending on the size of the relevant deformation causing 
the bending (2). It has been foreseen that the steps are 

parallel to the base to absorb the excess material 
originated during the manufacturing expansion stage of 

the container itself.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a anti-bending stepped system for 
metallic containers, the aim of which is to prevent the 
usual bending that normally appears in the metallic 
containers during the expansion operations carried out to 
obtaining or manufacturing such containers. The anti-bending system can be applied to all kind of 
metallic containers of a shape that can be either trunco-pyramidal, 
parallelopipedic, elliptical, etc. As everybody knows, when the body of a metallic container 
is expanded, a deformation occurs due to stress of the 
material. Such deformation is called "bending" and 
happens in the bottom causing an uneven distribution of 
material in the periphery of the body of the container. In the light of the above and to proceed with the 
manufacturing of the container it is necessary to correct 
such bending so that the whole periphery of the container 
is parallel or coplanar, thus enabling such deformation to disappear. Currently, there are two systems aimed to achieve the 
correction of the bending. The first one consists of 
cutting the material with its periphery already compensated 
prior to proceed to weld the body and its subsequent 
expansion. The second system consists of expanding the 
body of the container with concave expanding tools so 
that they can proportionately compensate the subsequent 
deformation. In the first case, we find the inconvenience of the loss 
of material, while in the second one the inconvenience 
stems from a bad or defective configuration of the  
 
container itself. Document WO 82/03 576 provides nestable can bodies which can be readily 
separated from one another when desired, but is not directed to the 
compensation of the bending deformation  
 The system proposed has been conceived to satisfactorily 
solve all those problems on the basis of a simple and 
efficient solution which the added advantage - when 
compared with the first conventional system referred 
above - of a better use of the raw material which, in 
turn and compared with the second conventional system, 
enables to obtain a more even and straight configuration 
of the wall of the container which makes the storage of 
the containers much easier. These features or advantages are achieved by using the 
system which is the object of claim 1 of this invention. This 
consists of making two or more steps of a certain 
dimension and at a specific place so that such steps 
determine the folding of the excess material just in the 
areas where such excess has been produced. Once the deformation

<CLAIMS>
A metallic expanded container (1) comprising a body 
the side wall (4) of which has an uneven distribution of 

material on the periphery of its base, which uneven 
distribution is due to bending deformation (2) during 

expansion, characterized in that it comprises two or more 
steps (3) at the areas where material is in excess for 

folding same, so that the whole periphery of the base of 
the side wall is coplanar, 

thus correcting the uneven distribution of material, 
wherein said areas are located 

at the corners of the side wall (4), said steps (3) are 
parallel to the base of the side wall, and the number of 

steps depends on the size (a) of the bending deformation 
(2), 

which would occur if no steps (3) are provided. 
A metallic expanded container according to claim 1, 
characterized in that all the steps (3) have the same 

depth (b).
