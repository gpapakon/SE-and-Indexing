<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disposable absorbent
article, such as a diaper, an incontinence guard,
a sanitary napkin or a panty guard, comprising an
absorbent pad which is embraced between a liquid-permeable
upper, or inner casing layer which is intended
to face towards the wearer in use, and an outer
casing layer, or backing layer, which is intended to
lie distal from the wearer in use, and further comprising
elastication.The absorbent pads of such absorbent articles are
intended to take-up body fluids discharged by the
wearer. One problem with earlier known absorbent
articles, such as diapers, is that large quantities of
fluids are discharged over very short periods of time
and that these large fluid quantities are unable to
penetrate the liquid-permeable casing layer quickly
enough. Another problem is that excrement is often not
able to penetrate through the casing layer at all,
unless special measures are taken to this effect. As a
result, excrement, and at times also urine, remains in
a receiving zone on top of the diaper, between the
inner casing layer and the user, which can naturally
lead to a number of problems and cause discomfort to
the wearer. This liquid and excrement, particularly
loose excrement, will float uncontrollably on top of
the inner casing layer and travel along the simplest
route under the influence of gravity, and sooner or
later the liquid or the loose excrement will run out
over the edges of the diaper, therewith soiling the
clothes or bed linen of the wearer, to the great
disadvantage of both the wearer, parents or nursing
personnel. The liquid and/or excrement is able to
escape at the end-edges and side-edges of the diaper, 
depending on the position of the wearer's body at the
time, although such leakage, or seepage, will take
place primarily at the side-edges of the diaper. That
part of the diaper which lies between the wearer's
thighs, the so-called crotch part, is particularly
restricted laterally, and consequently the urine and
excrement has only a very short distance to travel to
the side-edges of the diaper. It will be understood
that the risk of leakage from the diaper edges is
particularly great when the wearer lies on his/her
side and large quantities of urine or loose excrement
are discharged suddenly. Edge-leakage is also a problem
in articles which are intended toe absorb menstruation
fluid, such as sanitary napkins, since such
articles are very narrow, so that they can be worn
discretely and comfortably. It is known to guard
against discomfort caused by

absorbent pad (3) which is sandwiched between a liquid-permeable upper casing
layer (1) and a lower casing layer (2), and wherein arranged on both sides of a

central receiving zone, is a hose-like fold (20, 21) which is comprised of a pliable
or flexible material layer and extends in the longitudinal direction of the article on
