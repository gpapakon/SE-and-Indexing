<ABSTRACT>
A flush glass window seal for motor vehicle windows having a 
substantially rigid, dual durometer thermoplastic elastomer, carrier (12) 

component and a resilient elastomer, sealing insert (14) 
which are mechanically 

locked together. The carrier (12) components are extruded or 
molded in one 

piece to conform to the generally U-shaped vehicle opening and the 
insert (14) is 

extruded in a generally flat configuration suitable for 
application of a slip 

surface (58,60,62) thereon, prior to its insertion into the carrier.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to motor vehicle
flush glass window seals and more particularly to decorative
seals for sealing between a motor vehicle door
frame and movable window glass panels and to methods
for assembling the window seals.The motor vehicle industry, particularly the passenger
car and van portions of the industry, are increasingly
relying on flush glass window mounting for improving
the appearance of motor vehicles and reducing the aerodynamic
drag of the vehicles to make them more fuel
efficient. A number of conflicting requirements for such
seals makes them difficult and expensive to produce
and install. The increasingly complex shape of motor
vehicle bodies requires seals that are not simply bent in
a plane to surround the top edge of a flat glass window.
The seals are formed not only at the radii (corners of the
glass) but are also arched vertically to coincide with the
curved top surface of the glass and rounded sides of the
automobile.Heretofore, thermosetting materials such as ethylene-propylenediene-monomer
rubber (EPDM) have
been used extensively for vehicle window seals. Some
complex seals have included portions formed from
other materials such as thermoplastic materials, but
EPDM has usually been a major portion of the seal.
EPDM has a number of characteristics that make it useful
for forming window seals. It is relatively inexpensive,
effective, easy to extrude, and has outstanding weatherability,
resilience, resistance to abrasion, and durability.
However, it has several disadvantages that make it
increasingly hard to adapt to the ever more stringent
requirements of the motor vehicle industry. Not the least
of these disadvantages is that EPDM is normally made
black. Second, in order to form EPDM into the complex
shapes required by the motor vehicle industry, it is often
necessary to provide separately manufactured molded
corner pieces, and frequently a wire carrier, a stamped
metal carrier or a solid metal support. Each of these
adds to the cost of the seal.To improve the appearance of motor vehicles, the
industry demands window seals that are colored to
enhance the appearance of the vehicle, usually by
matching the body color. Obtaining a color on EPDM
has been less than satisfactory in the past, whereas
thermoplastics are readily colored.Although EPDM is cost effective (inexpensive) as a
material, the total cost of making and installing an
EPDM seal on a motor vehicle is high. The seal must
not only be formed at the radii of the glass by cutting,
mitering or welding
