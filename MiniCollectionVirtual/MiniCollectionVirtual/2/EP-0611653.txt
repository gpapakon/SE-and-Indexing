<ABSTRACT>
The body of a piezoelectrically operable ink jet 
printhead (12) is mounted in an upper side surface groove 

(48) formed in a mounting plate member (14). A rear bottom 
section (26) of the printhead body has an exposed top side 

surface portion (30) which is flush with the top side (44) 
of the mounting plate member and terminates forwardly of 

its rear end (42). A high density parallel array of 
mutually spaced linear conductive traces (52) is formed on 

this exposed top side surface portion, the traces being 
used to transmit electrical operating signals from a 

separate electronic driver to piezoelectrically drivable 
channel sidewall sections (36) within the interior of the 

printhead body. A multitiered printed circuit board (16) 
secured to the top side of the mounting plate member is 

used to connect the printhead to the electronic driver. 
The circuit board has a series of linear traces (52a) 

formed on its bottom side which register with and are 
soldered to the closely spaced printhead body traces (52), 

a spaced series of lower density spacing contact pads (54a) 
formed on its top side and releasably engageable with 

correspondingly spaced contact pads on the electronic 
driver, and internal crossover circuitry (62) that 

operatively connects the high density underside linear 
traces of the circuit board to its lower density top side 

contact pads.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to ink jet 
printhead apparatus and more particularly relates to 
apparatus for operatively interconnecting an ink jet 
printhead to an electrical power supply source used to 
control and piezoelectrically drive the printhead. A piezoelectrically actuated ink jet printhead is 
a relatively small device used to selectively eject 
tiny ink droplets onto a paper sheet operatively fed 
through a printer, in which the printhead is 
incorporated, to thereby form from the ejected ink 
droplets selected text and/or graphics on the sheet. 
In one representative configuration thereof, an ink jet 
printhead has a horizontally spaced parallel array of 
internal ink-receiving channels. These internal  
 
channels are covered at their front ends by a plate 
member through which a spaced series of small ink 
discharge orifices are formed. Each channel opens 
outwardly through a different one of the spaced 
orifices. A spaced series of internal piezoelectric wall 
portions of the printhead body separate and laterally 
bound the channels along their lengths. To eject an 
ink droplet through a selected one of the discharge 
orifices, the two printhead sidewall portions that 
laterally bound the channel associated with the 
selected orifice are piezoelectrically deflected into 
the channel and then returned to their normal 
undeflected positions. The driven inward deflection of 
the opposite channel wall portions increases the 
pressure of the ink within the channel sufficiently to 
force a small quantity of ink, in droplet form, 
outwardly through the discharge orifice. The electrical signals required to create and 
control the requisite printhead channel side wall 
deflections are typically generated by a suitable 
electronic driver. Due to the large number of very 
closely spaced ink channels present in even a small ink 
jet printhead structure, the resulting number of these 
electrical signals is quite high, while the physical 
area available at each ink channel for making the 
necessary printhead/driver connection is quite small. 
Accordingly, the connection of the printhead to its 
associated electronic driver has typically presented a 
significant connectivity design challenge. One approach to this connectivity problem has been 
to mount the electronic driver directly on the 
printhead body with accompanying circuitry to eliminate  
 
the need for a large number of interconnects from the 
printhead structure to the overall ink jet printing 
system. Such an ink jet printhead
