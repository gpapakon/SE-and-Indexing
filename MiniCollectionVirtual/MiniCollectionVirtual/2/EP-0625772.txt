<ABSTRACT>
A transmission and reading guide rapid return 
device for an auxiliary reading apparatus which includes 

a driving wheel driven by a DC motor through a 
transmission gear unit to move a reading guide in either 

direction alternatively, a switch, and a control bar 
driven by the reading guide to switch the switch between 

the forward position and the return position. The 
revolving speed of the DC motor is regulated by changing 

the voltage to the DC motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to auxiliary 
reading apparatus used to heap people read rapidly, and 
more specifically the present invention relates to a 
transmission and reading guide rapid return device for 
an auxiliary reading apparatus. Various auxiliary reading apparatus have been 
disclosed, and have appeared on the market. A normal 
reading apparatus generally comprises a reading guide 
driven from one side to the other at a constant speed. 
Each time the reading guide reaches the finish side, 
power supply must be switched off so that the reading 
guide is moved back to the start side again with the 
hand. This reading guide manual return operation 
is complicated and time consuming. In order to 
eliminate the drawbacks of the conventional auxiliary 
reading apparatus, the present inventor invented an 
auxiliary reading apparatus with a reading guide 
automatic return control which automatically moves the 
reading guide to the start side each time it reaches the 
finish side. This design eliminates the process of 
repeatedly moving the reading guide back to the start  
 
side. However, this design still has a drawback. 
Because the return speed of the reading guide is equal 
to its forward speed, much time is wasted in moving the 
reading guide back to the start side. The present invention has been accomplished 
under the aforesaid circumstances. It is therefore 
the primary object of the present invention to provide a 
transmission and reading guide rapid return device which 
automatically moves the reading guide back to the start 
side at a high speed each time the reading guide reaches 
the finish side. Fig. 1 is a perspective exploded view of the 
preferred embodiment of the present invention; and Fig. 2 is a perspective elevational view 
thereof. Referring to Figures 1 and 2, the present 
invention is generally comprised of a base 1, a motor 
drive 2, a driving wheel 3, a reading guide 4, a control 
bar 5, and a switch 6.  The base 1 is a platform for supporting the 
aforesaid other parts, having two upright posts 11 for 
mounting the motor drive 2, and a sliding slot 12 for 
sliding the control bar 5. The motor drive 2 comprises a DC motor 21, a 
transmission gear unit 22, and a transmission shaft 23 
coupled to the DC motor 21 through the transmission gear 
unit 22. The casing of the transmission gear unit 22 
has two mounting tabs 24 respectively fixed to the two 
upright posts 11 of the base 1 at the top. Because 
the transmission shaft 23 is driven by the DC motor 21 
through the

<CLAIMS>
A transmission and reading guide rapid 
return device for an auxiliary reading apparatus, 

comprising: 
   a flat base having two upright posts and an 

elongated sliding slot; 
   a motor drive fastened to said upright 

posts, said motor drive comprising a DC motor, a 
transmission gear unit, and a transmission shaft coupled 

to said DC motor by said transmission gear unit, said 
transmission gear unit having two mounting tabs 

respectively fixed to said upright posts at the top, the 
revolving speed of said DC motor being regulated by 

changing the voltage to said DC motor; 
   a driving wheel being a round wheel coupled 

to said transmission shaft; 
   a reading guide driven to move forwards and 

backwards by said driving wheel, said reading guide 
comprising a transverse scanning bar perpendicularly 

connected to a longitudinal bar, and a stop plate, said 
longitudinal bar comprising a series of pin holes near a 

rear end thereof spaced from said transverse scanning 
bar for mounting said stop plate by pins, and a 

projecting rod near said transverse scanning bar; 
   a control bar made from a narrow, elongated, 

flat plate, having a vertical bottom rod made to slide 
 

in said sliding slot on said base, and a horizontal top 
rod; 

   and a switch having a forward contact and a 
return contact alternatively connected by a switching 

lever to turn said DC motor in either direction, said 
switching lever being alternatively shafted from either 

contact to the other by said horizontal rod of said 
control bar. 
The transmission and reading guide rapid 
return device of claim 1 wherein said driving wheel has 

parallel grooves transversely spaced around the 
periphery to increase the friction force between said 

reading guide.
