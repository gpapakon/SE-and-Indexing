<ABSTRACT>
The pivot shaft is L-shaped in design and has a short shaft leg 1 which is connected to a small bearing block 12 and a long shaft leg 2 which engages in the sun visor body 14. There is provision for the bearing shaft to comprise essentially one steel pipe which has a flattened portion 6 in the region of the long shaft leg 2, which flattened portion 6 can be acted on by a catch spring 7 arranged on the bearing housing 15 of the sun visor body 14, for a free end region 3 of the short shaft leg 1 to have a diameter which is substantially reduced with respect to the rest of the diameter of the bearing shaft, and for the bearing shaft to bear in its angular region a plastic body 8 which is applied by injection-moulded encapsulation and extends over an axial sub-region of the long shaft leg 2, but ends before the flattened portion 6, and extends over the short shaft leg 1 up to just before its free end and is constructed here as a bearing shaft 9 which ends with a mushroom head 10.

Vehicle-sun-visor bearing spindle of L-shaped 
configuration, of which one, short spindle leg (1) is 

mounted rotatably in a bearing block (12), which can be 
fastened on the vehicle bodywork, and the other, long 

spindle leg (2), which forms the swing-action spindle for 
the sun-visor body (14), is mounted rotatably in a 

bearing housing (15) arranged in the sun-visor body (14), 
the bearing spindle essentially comprising a steel tube 

which has a flattened section (6) in the region of the 
long spindle leg (2), and a plastic body (8) being 

applied by injection moulding around the angled region of 
the bearing spindle and extending over an axial subregion 

of the long spindle leg (2), but terminating 
before the flattened section (6), and extending over the 

short spindle leg (1) to just before the free end thereof, 
characterized in that a stop spring (7) arranged on 

the bearing housing (15) of the sun-visor body (14) can 
act on the flattened section (6) in order to keep the 

sun-visor body (14), under prestressing, resting against 
the vehicle roof lining when it is not in use, in that a 

free end region (3) of the short spindle leg (1) has a 
diameter which is considerably reduced in comparison with 

the rest of the bearing-spindle diameter, in that that 
region of the plastic body (8) which extends over the 

short spindle leg (1) is designed as a bearing shank (9) 
terminating with a mushroom head (10), in that the free 

axial end region (17) of the long spindle leg (2) also 
has a diameter which is considerably reduced in comparison 

with the rest of the bearing-spindle diameter, in 
that a freely tapering radial opening (18) is provided on  

 
the end region (17) of the reduced-diameter spindle leg 

(2), in that there is inserted into the end region (17) 
of the long spindle leg (2) a contact element (19) which 

has a cylindrical shank (20) and a cylindrical head (21) 
and bears, on the shank (20) a first insulating tube 

(22), which is arranged between the free end of the long 
spindle leg (2) and the head (21) of the contact element 

(19), and a second insulating tube (23), which separates 
the shank (20) from the inner wall of the long spindle 

leg (2), in that the contact element (19) is connected in 
an electrically conductive manner to a bared end of an 

insulated conductor wire (24) running through the bearing 
spindle, and in that the free end of the short spindle 

leg (1) is connected in an electrically conductive manner 
to an earth connection conductor (26). 
Bearing spindle according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the flattened section (6) is designed as a 

stamped zone.
