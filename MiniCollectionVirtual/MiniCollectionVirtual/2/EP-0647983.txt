<ABSTRACT>
An antenna for a base station comprising a plurality of antenna arrays 
(40; Fig. 6a) each capable of forming a multiplicity of separate 

overlapping narrow beams in azimuth, the arrays being positioned 
such that the beams formed by the arrays provide a coverage in 

azimuth wider than each array. Means are provided for 

communication with a base station network whereby communication 
link means (77; Fig. 5) are provided for communication with a base 

station network whereby. in addition to telecommunications message 
traffic passing through the smart antenna, control and supervisory 

information can be exchanged between the smart antenna and the 
base station network.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a base station antenna arrangement, for 
use in a Cellular Radio communications system. Cellular radio systems are currently increasing in use throughout 
the world providing telecommunications to mobile users. In order to 
meet the capacity demand, within the available frequency band 
allocation, cellular radio systems divide a geographic area to be 
covered into cells. At the centre of each cell is a base station, 
through which the mobile stations communicate. The available 
communication channels are divided between the cells such that 
the same group of channels are reused by certain cells. The 
distance between the reused cells is planned such that the co-channel 
interference is maintained at a tolerable level. When a new cellular radio system is initially deployed, operators 
are often interested in maximising the uplink (mobile station to base 
station) and downlink (base station to mobile station) range. The 
ranges in many systems are uplink limited due to the relatively low 
transmitted power levels of hand portable mobile stations. Any 
increase in range means that less cells are required to cover a  
 
given geographic area, hence reducing the number of base stations 
and associated infrastructure costs. When a cellular radio system is mature the capacity demand can 
often increase, especially in cities, to a point where more, smaller 
size cells are needed in order to meet the required capacity per unit 
area. The process used to create these smaller cells is known as 
cell splitting. Any technique that can provide additional capacity 
without the need for cell-splitting will again reduce the number of 
base station sites and associated infrastructure costs. The antenna used at the base station site can potentially make 
significant improvements to the range and capacity of a cellular 
radio system. The ideal base station antenna pattern is a beam of 
narrow angular width as shown in Fig 1a. The narrow beam is 
directed at the wanted mobile, is narrow in both the azimuth and 
elevation planes, and tracks the mobile's movements. When 
compared to an omni-directional antenna, such a beam will have 
the dual benefits of having high gain, leading to increased range in 
thermal noise limited initial deployments, and rejecting interference 
from co-channel reuse cells allowing higher capacity without cell 
splitting in mature deployments. The narrow beam reduces 
interference in a balanced manner on the uplink and downlink. On 
the uplink the base station receiver is
