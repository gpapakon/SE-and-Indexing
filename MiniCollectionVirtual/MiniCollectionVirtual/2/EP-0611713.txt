<ABSTRACT>
This invention proposes a handling-switching apparatus 
in which the pieces to be handled are placed on conveyor 

tables constituted by rotating carpets (1) that are inclined 
and set to rotation to unload the piece into collecting 

vessels suitably preset. 
Means (12-15) are provided to control the unloading of the 
piece, that are operated and subsequently brought again 

to a non-operative position by the carriage itself while 
it moves forward, so as to avoid the risk of breakage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention proposes a handling-switching apparatus 
including a number of conveyor tables, each constituted 
by a rotating carpet on which the piece to be handled is 
placed and that performs unloading into collecting 
vessels that are determined at the moment of introducing 
the piece into the machine, said collecting vessels 
being placed along the path below the carpets. A handling-switching apparatus of this kind is already 
known from the post-published Italian Patent Application No. MI91A2213 
dated 06.08.1991, of the same applicant (publication number IT 1254117), 
and from US-A-1 273 510, which corresponds to the preamble of the 
independant claim. The handling-switching apparatus 
according to the invention is characterised by providing the means that 
place the carpet in an inclined position and set it in 
rotation such that they are directly operated by the 
carriage on which the carpet is mounted, so as to avoid 
the risk of breakages due to an untimely operation of 
the same. In more detail, in the handling-switching apparatus 
according to the invention, each carpet is mounted on a 
carriage that is in turn provided with a central shaft 
connected to a pair of dragging chains.  
 The carpet supporting rollers are mounted on shafts that 
are fitted, on one side, with a pair of wheels, one of 
which is idle, that run on a rail track placed along the 
path, thereby keeping the carpet in the horizontal 
position. Such rail track has some movable parts that are lifted 
at the moment of unloading, so as to engage the pair of 
wheels present at an end of the carriage, deviating it 
beneath the rail track, so as to bring the carriage in 
an inclined position. The movements of the rail track movable section are 
controlled by a cam integrally connected with the 
carriage supporting shaft, while the return to the 
previous position is operated by the same wheels that 
are deviated towards the rail track lower part. In this way the movements of the rail track movable part 
are directly controlled by the carriage involved in the 
unloading operation, thus avoiding the risk of breakages 
due, for instance, to a delayed operation of the movable 
wall. This invention will now be described in detail, in a 
non-limiting example, referring to the attached figures, 
where: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of an apparatus according 
to the invention;  
 Figure 2 shows a detail of a carpet during the 
conveyed piece unloading step; Figure 3 is a perspective view of a part of the carpet 
dragging devices in
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A handling-switching apparatus including a plurality 
of conveyor tables dragged along a fixed path, each 

conveyor table being of a carriage dragged by 
means of a belt, on which carriage a rotating carpet (1) is mounted 

that constitutes the conveying - unloading table for the 
workpiece and that is tilted by rotation of the carriage at the moment of 

unloading, characterized in that the means (12, 13, 14) causing the 
carpet tilting and unloading operation are 

actuated by means (19) on the carriage on which said carpet (1) is mounted. 
A handling-switching apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 
in which every carpet (1) is mounted on the relevant 

carriage by means of a pair of idle rollers (9), on the 
shafts of which a pair of wheels (8) are mounted that run on 

a rail track consisting of a "C"-shaped profiled iron, 
the wheels (8) that normally leaning on the external surface 

of the upper flange of said profile iron, characterized 
in that said flange (11) has liftable sections (12), the 

opening of which is controlled by a cam (14) operated by 
the carpet carriage, said movable wall (12) passing from a 

substantially horizontal closing position to an opening 
position in which it engages one of the pairs of wheels 

of said carriage, deviating it to the internal part of 
said "C"-shaped profiled iron, thereby bringing said  

 
carriage in an inclined position by rotation on 

supporting shaft (7). 
A handling-switching apparatus as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in that each pair of wheels mounted on the 

carpet supporting rollers shaft includes an idle wheel (9) 
and a wheel (8,) said wheel (8) having a larger diameter and 

being integrally connected with said shaft, the 
internal part of the "C"-shaped profiled iron that 

constitutes the rail track being so shaped as to have a 
raised section (21) suitable to engage the idle wheel in 

order to keep wheel (8,) which is integrally connected to 
the roller shaft, pressed against the rail track flange 

to control the carpet rotation. 
A handling-switching apparatus as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in that said movable part (12) of the rail 

track has an appendix (20) that, when said movable part (12) 
is open, interferes with the path of the carriage wheel 

inside the "C"-shaped profiled iron, so to allow to 
control the closing of said movable part (12) by means of 

the very carriage wheels. 
A handling-switching apparatus as claimed in any of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that said rail 

track movable part (12) is connected by means of a 
connecting rod with a cam that is mounted so as to slide 

on pin (15), a stirrup (17) being provided, controlled by  
 

piston (18), suitable to act on said cam (14) to move it, in 
opposition to the force exerted by elastic means, until 

it is brought to interfere with means (19) integrally 
connected with carriage supporting shaft (7). 
A handling-switching apparatus as claimed in the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said carriages 

move along a path consisting of a loop developing in a 
vertical plane.
