<ABSTRACT>
A stackable bulk transport container (2) for corrosive and/or toxic 
or oxidising liquids which consists of a cylindrical inner container (4) 

surrounded by an outer container (3) having a regular stackable shape, 
both inner and outer containers being made of a corrosion resistant 

material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
stackable bulk transport container and in particular to an 
intermediate bulk transport container for Class 5 and Class 
8 liquids i.e. corrosive liquids which may also be toxic 
and/or oxidants. Containers of this type must be corrosion-resistant, 
and must also be very strong, since typically each 
container will hold 1000 litres of liquid having a specific 
gravity of up to 1.8. The containers must be easy to 
handle and stack. To fulfil the above criteria, containers of this type 
hitherto have been made of a metal outer structure of 
rectangular cross-section, for strength and ease of 
handling and stacking, and an inner liner of plastics 
material, which actually contains the corrosive liquid. A 
container of this type is disclosed in US Patent 5156268 
(Nichols) which describes a rigid rectangular outer 
container and a thin-walled plastics inner tank, the walls 
of which are supported by the outer container. However, 
this construction is not ideal, since it is expensive to 
manufacture, and the metal outer is susceptible to 
corrosion damage from spills from the inner liner.  
 US Patent 4815621 (Bartis) discloses an alternative 
design of double-walled tank, in which an inner liquid-containing 
tank is surrounded by an outer containment 
tank. However, the tanks are designed for above-ground 
long-term storage, and although portable when empty, are 
not intended or designed for transporting liquid or for 
stacking. Hence, the inner and outer tanks can be very 
much thicker than for a transport container, since weight 
considerations do not really apply. DE-A-2906974 gives an example of a stackable bulk 
transport container comprising an inner and an outer 
shell, both corrosion resistant, an upper filling 
aperture and a lower emptying aperture. However, the 
inner shell of this container is rectangular in cross-section 
and thus not efficiently self-supporting. It would be advantageous to construct the whole of 
the container from a corrosion-resistant material, such 
as plastics, but proposed designs of this type have 
encountered two problems:- a rectangular-cross-section 
plastics container is not strong enough to withstand both 
the pressure of the contained liquid and stacking 
pressures, and a cylindrical container, whilst strong 
enough to withstand the pressure of the contained liquid, 
is an inconvenient shape to stack. The present invention overcomes these problems by 
providing a stackable bulk transport container 
comprising: an inner

<CLAIMS>
A stackable bulk transport container (2) 
comprising: an inner container (4) which is provided with 

filling means (6) for filling said inner container and 
emptying means (7,8) for emptying said inner container; 

and an outer container (3) which encloses said inner 
container (2), the external shape of said outer container 

being a regular, stackable, shape; and both the inner (4) 
and outer (3) containers being made of a corrosion-resistant 

material wherein
 
   the filling means (6) is separate from the emptying 

means (7,8), the filling means (6) being located at an 
upper end of the container and the emptying means (7,8) 

being located at the lower end of the container; 
characterised in that the inner container is a 

cylindrical container having walls of such thickness that 
said inner container (4) is capable of fully supporting 

the pressures of the contained liquid when the inner 
container (4) is filled. 
The container (2) as claimed in claim 1 wherein 
the outer container (3) is formed with a plurality of 

equidistantly-spaced inwardly-projecting ribs (9) each of 
which projects inwards so as to contact or nearly contact 

the outer wall of the inner container (4).  
 
The container (2) as claimed in claim 1 or 
claim 2 wherein the outer container (3) is of generally 

square cross-section. 
The container (2) as claimed in any preceding 
claim wherein said filling means (6) comprises a 

closeable aperture (6) formed in the top of the inner 
container (4); and said emptying means (7,8) comprises a 

sump (7) fitted with a drain valve (8) which projects 
through the outer container (3). 
The container (2) as claimed in any preceding 
claim wherein the base of said outer container is formed 

with fork-lift tine pockets (11). 
The container (2) as claimed in any preceding 
claim wherein the top of said outer container is closed 

by a removable lid (14) formed with an aperture through 
which said filling means (6) projects. 
The container (2) as claimed in claim 6 wherein 
said lid (14) overlaps the upper edge of the outer 

container (3), which is reinforced by an angle-section 
(19) secured therearound. 
The container (2) as claimed in claim 6 or 
claim 7 wherein said lid (14) is formed with outwardly-pro
truding 
cleats and the base of the outer container (3)  

 
is formed with corresponding recesses to enable the 

containers (2) to be stacked one on top of the other with 
the cleats on the lower container (2) nesting in the 

recesses on the upper container (2). 
The container (2) as claimed in claim 8 wherein 
said cleats are formed with recesses for engaging lashing 

ropes. 
The container (2) as claimed in claim 4 and any 
claim dependent thereon wherein the top of the inner 

container (4) is formed with a trough (16) surrounding 
said filling means (6) to collect any spills. 
The container (2) as claimed in claim 10 
wherein said trough (6) is formed with a drain hole for 

draining any spills into the space between the inner (4) 
and outer (3) containers. 
The container (2) as claimed in any preceding 
claim wherein the inner (4) and outer (3) containers are 

made of a translucent or transparent plastics material 
and a gauge (21) is mounted on one side of the container 

(2) so that the level of the contents can be measured. 
The container (2) as claimed in any preceding 
claim wherein both inner (4) and outer (3) containers are 

made of medium-density polyethylene.
