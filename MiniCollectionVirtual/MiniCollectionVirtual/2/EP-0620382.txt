<ABSTRACT>
A quick assemblable chain link for a cable-holding 
chain of the type consisting of a chain link structure 

provided, at its ends, with respective male and female 
wings (5,7) shaped so as to form the means for connecting 

each chain link with each adjoining chain link, wherein 
the male wings (5) include corresponding pins (6) having an 

inclined surface (9), the female wings (7) are formed with 
holes (8) adapted to engage on corresponding pins of an 

adjoining chain link, said holes (8) including respective 
beveled portions (17) with an inclined bottom surface (10), so as 

to facilitate elastic deformation of said wings for 
snap-fitting of pins on a wing into holes on an 

adjoining wing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is relating to a quick assemblable chain 
link for a cable holding chain comprising, on the one 
hand, a pair of wings having pins provided thereon 
and, on the other hand, corresponding wings in which 
there are formed holes adapted to receive the pins of 
an adjoining chain link, wherein said pins have a 
blind hole for receiving a finishing element, which 
is fitted for appearance purposes.  
 There are a number of cases where it is necessary that 
a bundle of cables should be enclosed in a protective 
structure which has to enable, however, a certain 
mobility thereof. A typical case is, for example, a machine tool in which 
very frequently a tool with associate operating devices 
is mounted to a movable tool holder. It is in this case necessary to provide means capable 
of ensuring continuity in power supply to a motor 
driving the tool, as well as the supply of lubricant, 
cooling fluid, air, etc., to a tool, for any working 
position to which that tool is moved. Electrical cables and/or tubes supplying a tool, which 
are connected, on the one hand, to a fixed intake means 
on a machine structure and, on the other hand, to a 
movable tool holder, must be protected and guided in 
their movement to prevent them from being damaged by 
getting caught on parts of a machine. To this end, a bundle of cables and/or tubes are 
usually passed inside a chain that is formed by joining 
together a number of chain links having a rigid 
structure, the chain providing protection to the cables 
while permitting the cables to have a required freedom 
of movement therein. These cable-holding chains are frequently made of a 
plastic material both in view of economical  
 
advantages, in particular, the possibility of producing 
the chain links by molding and/or injection processes, 
and for many practical reasons such as the low noise 
and light weight properties of this type of material. Chain links are known whose structure comprises pairs 
of wings at two opposite ends thereof, i.e. a first 
pair of wings provided with protruding pins of uniform 
hights and a second pair of wings formed with holes 
adapted to receive said pins. However, this solution requires that one pair of wings 
be considerably expanded in order to be able to insert 
the pins into the respective holes which implies a 
great effort when large size chains are used. Also known are chains in which the chain links are 
connected together by means of separate pins which are 
snap-fitted into corresponding holes after the chain 
links

<CLAIMS>
A quickly assemblable chain link for cable-holding 
chains of the type comprising a chain link structure 

provided at its ends with respective male (5) and female (7) 
wings shaped so as to form means for connecting each 

chain link with an adjoining chain link, 
said male wings, (5) being provided with respective 

pins (6) having an inclined surface (9), the female wings (7) 
having holes (8) formed therein for engaging on 

corresponding pins of an adjoining chain link, said 
holes including respective beveled portions (10) having 

inclined bottom surfaces, in order to faciliate elastic 
deformation of wings for snap-fitting of pins on a wing 

into holes of an adjoining wing, characterized in that 
said pins are formed with a blind hole for 

receiving a finishing element therein, which is fitted 
for appearance purposes. 
The chain link according to claim 1, 
wherein the wall of the chain link is reduced in 

thickness at an end portion thereof so that after the 
chain links have been assembled together the chain 

obtained therefrom will show a wall of constant 
thickness.  

 
The chain link according to any preceding claim 1, 
wherein a recess (15,17) is provided in each said wing (5,7) and this 

recess is to receive a correponding tooth (16,18) on the wing 
of an adjoining chain link, engagement of said tooth 

against the end walls of said recess causing rotation 
of the chain links with respect to one another to be 

restrained. 
The The chain link according to any preceding claims, 
wherein the chain link has one side open, a strap (4) being 

provided whose bent-over ends (22) are adaptetd to fit in 
corresponding recesses (3) of the chain link walls so as to 

close said one open side after cables have been 
introduced. 
The chain link according to claim 4, wherein the 
bent-over ends (22) of said strap (4) include teeth (23,24) which are 

adapted to interengage with corresponding pins (21) formed 
in respective recesses in the chain link walls. 
The chain link according to claims 4-5, wherein said 
strap ends include each two teeth (23,24) a first tooth acting 

to facilitate opening of said strap, the second tooth 
acting to lock said strap in place by interengagement 

with said pins. 
The The chain link according to any preceding claim, 
wherein it is obtained by injection of a thermoplastic 

material.  
 
A cable-holding chain using chain links according 
to anyone of the preceding claims.
