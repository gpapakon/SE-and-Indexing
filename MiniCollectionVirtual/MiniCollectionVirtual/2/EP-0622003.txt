<ABSTRACT>
A multichannel television access control system is disclosed wherein processing of the broadbande signal is performed by gated coherent RF injection on a plurality of channels, thereby effecting selective descrambling of an arbitrary subset of channels in a channel group. The system provides for a closed loop injection signal phasor control so as to maintain substantially constant relationship between the television signals and the injected signals. The combined signals are supplied to subscribers enabling the use of their cable ready equipment. The broadband signal is coupled to a broadband amplifier (104) via a power splitter (102). The injected signals are combined through line (114) with the amplified broadband signal by directional coupler (108), resulting in the composite signal on line (109). The broadband signal on line (109) is fed to the subscriber port (112) through directional tap (110). The injected signals forming together the composite signal injected at line (114) are generated by a digital broadband generator (136) feeding RF switch (116). During the time in which injection is required, RF switch (116) is at position (117) as shown in the figure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to television transmission and receiving systems
and more particularly to CATV or over-the-air multichannel systems wherein a plurality
of standard television signals are scrambled by suppression of normal synchronizing
pulses or otherwise modified during the active video time and subsequently selectively
descrambled at authorized subscriber locations in a manner which simultaneously renders
a plurality of authorized channels to be provided unscrambled to the subscriber's
television set.In subscription television, or pay television, programming signals of premium
channels are typically transmitted in a scrambled form so that unauthorized viewers, that
is, viewers who do not pay to receive the specific programming, are not able to view the
transmitted signal on their television receivers. Authorized viewers are provided with
means to descramble or decode the scrambled television signal and usually such
descrambling means are capable of being selectively enabled to descramble specific
channels. This enablement can be done remotely by the service provider or the CATV
operator, by selective addressing of individual descrambling means associated with
subscribers who paid to receive the scrambled programming.A technique commonly used for television scrambling is that of sync-suppression
wherein the RF level of the horizontal and vertical synchronizing pulses is suppressed
to a level below that of the video so that the standard television receiver is unable to
establish regular synchronism and instead erratically locks on RF peaks in the active video 
thereby creating an unviewable picture on the television set. In addition, the ability of the
television receiver to use the color reference burst associated with the horizontal
synchronizing pulse is severely degraded thereby causing distorted color reproduction
or disabling the color circuitry of the television set. Exemplary prior art sync
suppression systems are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. US-A- 3,184,537 to Court et al; US-A- 3,478,166
to Reiter et al; US-A- 3,530,232 to Reiter et al and US-A- 4,222,068 to Thompson. In these systems,
the horizontal synchronizing levels are suppressed or reduced to gray level and an
additional keying control signal is normally transmitted together with the scrambled
television signal for controlling reconstruction or regeneration of the proper sync levels
at the authorized descrambler, thereby providing unscrambled normal television signal
at the receiver. For example, in U.S. Pat. No.
