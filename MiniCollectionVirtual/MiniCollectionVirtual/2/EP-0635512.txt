<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to phosphites, and
more particularly, relates to neo-alkyl phosphites,
the preparation thereof, and polymer compositions
stabilized therein.Organic phosphites are known thermal oxidative
stabilizing agents for polymers and other organic
materials. Such phosphites however typically suffer
from one or more of the following problems resulting
from structural deficiencies: (a) they degrade to
alcohols which undergo H2O (water) generation through
beta-elimination of a hydrogen with an -OH group, and
it is believed that this H2O generation can lead to
further degradation of the phosphite; (b) they
experience hydrolytic instability upon exposure to
moisture which attacks the bond between the oxygen
atoms and the phosphorus atom (O-P bonds); and (c)
they degrade into alcohol degradation products which
have boiling points of less than 250°C which
volatilize out of phosphite stabilized polymeric
compositions under normal polymer processing
conditions, for example degradation products such as
low molecular weight diols such as 1,3 propane diol
(BP 213°C), 2,2 dimethyl-1,3 propane diol (BP 206°C),
2,2 diethyl-1,3 propane diol (BP 240°C), and 2
methyl, 2 propyl-1,3 propane diol (BP 234°C).
Finally, in processes for making organic phosphites
it is desirable to be able to make the phosphite from
a direct reaction between alcohols and PCl3 but if a 
beta-hydrogen is present in the alcohol, then
undesirable alkylchlorides will most likely form.US 2961454 discloses phosphites obtained by the
transesterification of tris 2-chloropropyl phosphite
or tris 2-chlorobutyl phosphite with a mono or
polyhydric alcohol having from 6 to 12 carbon atoms
in the absence of a catalyst.US 3467733 discloses cyclic phosphites and diphosphites,
such as bis(1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinanyl -
2-oxy)aryl alkanes, and mono- and bis(1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinanyl-2-oxy)benzenes,
useful as stabilizers
for organic compositions, such as rubber and
polyvinyl chloride, are made by reacting a cyclic
phosphorohalidite with a hydroxy aromatic compound,
subsequently neutralizing the reaction product with
a nitrogen-containing compound, such as ammonia and
recovering the desired cyclic phosphite or
diphosphite.Neo-alkyl phosphites derived from a neoglycol
with PC13 are known, see Dever et al., US Patent No.
3714302. While these neo-alkyl phosphites have no
β-hydrogens, they lack stearic bulk on the α-carbons
which merely have hydrogen radicals thereon, thus
rendering the phosphites susceptible to hydrolytic
instability, and possibly
