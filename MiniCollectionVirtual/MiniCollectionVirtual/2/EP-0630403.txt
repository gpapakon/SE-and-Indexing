<ABSTRACT>
Plants in which flavonol activity has been impaired are conditionally male fertile (CMF), and male fertility can be rescued or restored by providing fertility restoring flavonols at pollen sites in the plant. Although viable pollen is produced by flavonol deficient plants, pollen germination and tube growth are severely reduced both in vivo and in vitro, resulting in plants which are self sterile. However, by contacting pollen of the plant with an amount of a fertility restoring flavonol effective to enhance germination of the pollen, full pollen germination and tube growth may be restored. Useful fertility restoring flavonols include compounds of formula (I), wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R7, and R8 are hydrogen, hydroxyl or alkoxy having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms. Particularly preferred flavonols include galangin, kaempferol, iso-rhamnetin, quercetin and morin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for the regulation of fertility in plants,
and more particularly to the creation of flavonoid-deficient, conditionally male
fertile plants by, for example, blocking the activity of flavanone-3-hydroxylase in the
plants, and to the restoration of fertility in flavonoid-deficient, conditionally male
fertile plants by providing fertility restoring flavonols at the plant pollen sites.Successful fertilization in higher plants is central not only to the
perpetuation of a species but also provides the large populations that are the source
of variation and competition that drive natural selection. In the post-dispersal
phase of male gametophyte development, pollen germinates on the stigma and
extrudes a tube through a germination pore in the pollen wall. In angiosperms, the
growing pollen tube is a conduit for the migration of the two sperm cells through
the stylar tissue to the embryo sac where they fuse with the egg and central cells to
form the zygote and endosperm, respectively (E. G. Cutter, 1978, Plant Anatomy,
Part 1, Experimentation and Interpretation. E. Arnold, Eds., Addison Wesley,
London, chap. 6.). Pollen development takes place within the anther and at
maturity each grain is a multi-celled spore containing products of both sporophytic
gene expression, arising from the inner layer of the anther wall (tapetum), and
haploid gene expression from the vegetative cell within each grain (J. P.
Mascarenhas, 1990, Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol Biol. 41:317; J. P.
Mascarenhas, 1989, Plant Cell1:657). Although the process of microsporogenesis
is well documented histologically, little is known of the molecular and biochemical
factors that are involved in post-dispersal pollen function. Flavonoids are an abundant class of small molecular weight (âˆ¼300)
plant-specific metabolites which share a common 15 carbon skeletal structure.
Modification of the basic structure yields an extensive array of compounds that are
classified by the oxidation state and substitution pattern of the various rings. Some
classes are pigments (e.g., anthocyanins, chalcones, and particular flavonols and
flavones) while other classes are colorless ultraviolet-absorbing compounds. The
anthocyanins, particularly pelargonin, cyanidin, and delphinidin, are responsible
for the red, blue and violet plant colors. Other pigmented flavonoids, the
chalcones, and some flavonols and flavones, contribute significantly to the yellow,
ivory and cream colored flowers. Pollen flavonoids have been identified in
