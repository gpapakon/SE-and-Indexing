<DESCRIPTION>
This invention involves a method and system for controlling vibrations in
structures such as car frames, building floors and roofs and the like.Previous attempts at controlling such vibrations are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,
635, 892, "Active Vibration Suppressor" to Baker; U.S. Patent No. 4, 819, 182,
"Method and Apparatus for Reducing Vibration of a Helicopter Fuselage" to King et al
and U.S. Patent No. 4, 950, 966, "Adaptive Vibration Canceller" to Moulds. In
addition, another system is shown and described in U.K. Patent Application GB
2165667A, "Method of reducing the transmission of vibrations" to Redman-White et al.Methods for controlling vibrations in flexible structures have been recently
deemed to have commercial merit such as active engine mounts. The techniques
utilized have merit when isolating vibrations of one structure from another structure.
The key to doing this is the co-location of control force and sensing means which
simplify the problem and make the instant system much better than prior systems.The active mount takes advantage of the co-location of the vibration "footprint"
and the control force and the sensing means at the connection point. However, many
technical difficulties exist in the implementation of an active mount. One problem in
particular is the coupling of the actuator and resilient means. This problem becomes
more troublesome when multiple degrees of freedom are attempted. Thus, it is
desirable to have a system in which the benefits of co-location of actuation and sensing
is accomplished while avoiding the complexities of active mount integration. The latter
goal is particularly important in retrofit situations. For example, in order to actively
control the vibration from the engine of a pleasure craft as it enters the hull, active
mounts could be used. However, the engine would need re-alignment upon
reinstallation. The use of the subject invention would avoid this situation.It is critical that all connections to a structure (or at least the degrees of freedom
in which significant vibration is transmitted) be controlled with the subject invention.
In this way all force inputs to the base structure will be controlled. Co-location of the
sensor and force producing means will serve to match the "disturbance" input with the
control input thereby effecting the modes of the base structure in the same manner,
thereby controlling the structure's response.This invention is intended for use in applications of mounting machinery to
flexible structures at discrete mounting
