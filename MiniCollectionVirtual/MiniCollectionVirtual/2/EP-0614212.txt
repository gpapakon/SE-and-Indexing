<ABSTRACT>
A flat substrate carrier comprising a machined main 
surface for supporting substrates to be treated, a surface opposite to the 

main surface and coating on all sides. The main surface may have been 
machined with a view to the removal of the treated substrates from the main 

surface following treatment. The opposite surface has been subjected to such 
a machining operation or treatment that the mechanical stresses at both 

surfaces substantially compensate each other. The opposite surface may be 
machined over substantially the same area as the main surface, for example 

by using a material-removing operation or an EDM-operation. Both surfaces 
may have been subjected to the same operation. In case a treatment is carried 

out, which treatment may be a physical or a chemical treatment, just like 
the treatment by which the coating is applied, the thickness of the coating 

at the opposite surface may be less than the maximum thickness of the coating 
at the main surface. The substrate carrier itself may comprise graphite, 

carbon, ceramics, metal or a metal alloy, whilst the coating may comprise 
silicon carbide, pyrolytic graphite, aluminium nitride, aluminium oxide or 

silicon nitride. The thickness of the coating may range from 1 - 1,000 µm. 
The advantage of the proposed substrate carrier is that it will not warp 

after the coating has been applied.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a flat substrate carrier
comprising a main surface for supporting substrates to be treated which
main surface has been machined for providing a surface relief in said main
surface.Such a substrate carrier is known from W0 88/07 487.The known substrate carrier in the shape of a so-called
susceptor for supporting a single substrate for rotation about an axis
extending perpendicularly to the centre of the substrate, which is intended
for use in a chemical vapour deposition chamber of the type which is used
for manufacturing integrated circuits has been machined with a view to
the removal of the treated substrates from the main surface following
treatment and has the undesirable characteristic of warping after a coating
on all sides has been applied.The object of the invention is to provide a flat
substrate carrier which will remain flat also after the coating on all
sides has been applied.The invention is defined in claim 1.The main surface may be machined for another reason
than the one mentioned above, for example in order to ensure an optimum
temperature distribution of the substrate carrier in the chemical vapour
deposition chamber.The invention will be discussed in more detail hereafter
with reference to the drawings, in which:
Figure 1 is a plan view of an embodiment of the proposed
substrate carrier;Figure 2 is a bottom view of the substrate carrier of
Figure 1; andFigure 3 is a larger-scale view of a possible groove
profile of the proposed substrate carrier.As shown in Figure 1 the proposed substrate carrier does
not necessarily differ from a known substrate carrier when seen in plan view.
In Figure 1 the substrate carrier, in this case in the shape of a rotatable
circular flat single-substrate carrier or single wafer susceptor, is
indicated by reference numeral 1 and its main surface is indicated by
reference numeral 2. The substrate carrier 1 may consist of a material based
on graphite, carbon, ceramics, metal or a metal alloy, and is on all sides
provided with a coating of for example silicon carbide, pyrolytic graphite,
aluminium nitride, aluminium oxide or silicon nitride, which coating may have
been applied by means of a chemical vapour deposition process. The main
surface 2 is provided with a circular upright edge 3, within which a wafer
(not shown) may be accommodated. From a technical point of view, however,
it is possible to leave out said edge 3. The main surface 2 of the substrate
carrier 1 has been machined, within the edge 3 in this case, and a small
portion
