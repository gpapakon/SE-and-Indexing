<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermoplastic resin composition 
comprising a polyphenylene ether resin and a polyamide resin. More particulary, 
the invention relates to a thermoplastic resin composition comprising a 
polyphenylene ether resin and a polyamide resin which has an elasticity and a 
high tensile strength simultaneously. A polyphenylene ether resin (PPE resin) is a thermoplastic resin with 
various characteristics such as an excellent mechanical property, an excellent 
thermal resistance and an excellent dimensional stability. But an impact 
resistance and a solvent resistance of PPE resin alone are extremely poor and a 
processability is poor because of its high melt viscosity. On the other hand, a 
polyamide resin is a thermoplastic resin with characteristics of an excellent 
mechanical property, a solvent resistance and a processability, but its impact 
resistance and thermal resistance are poor, and furthermore, a dimensional 
stability is remarkably poor owing to its high water absorption, and the 
decrease of mechanical property is severe owing to its water absorption. 
Blending both of them is proposed to make up for defects of these resins. But a 
good mechanical property which both resins have is lost by only simply blending. 
It is contrived that the improvements of dispersibility and a mechanical 
property are attained by addition of various mutual compatibilizers at the blend 
of a PPE resin with a polyamide resin. These methods are illustrated in 
Japanese Patent Publication (Koukoku) NO. 60-11966, Japanese Patent Publication 
(Koukoku) NO. 61-10494, Japanese Patent Publication (Koukai) NO. 59-66452 and 
Japanese Patent Publication (Koukai) NO. 56-49753.
 
Thus obtained PPE / polyamide resin compositions are being applied to an  
 
electrical and an electronics field and a car field as materials with excellent 
mechanical property, thermal resistance, solvent resistance, processability, 
dimensional stability and water absorption property. However, PPE/polyamide 
resin composition has a problem that rigidity is comparatively high and it is 
difficult to meet with uses demanded for elasticity. Although it has been tried 
to decrease a rigidity by blending of rubber-like materials, there occurs 
problems that a tensile strength decrease simultaneously with the decrease of a 
rigidity by blending of rubber-like mateials and a flowability at processing 
also decreases, therefore, its applicable range has been restricted. The purpose of the present invention is to solve these
