<ABSTRACT>
A method is described for the identification and cloning of promoters that express under a defined environmental condition, such as growth in glucose medium. Using this method, five (Trichodermal) promoters capable of the high expression of operably linked coding sequences are identified, one of which is the promoter for (T. reesei tef1). Also provided are altered (cbh1) promoters, altered so that glucose no longer represses expression from such promoter. The invention further provides vectors and hosts that utilize such promoters, and unique fungal enzyme compositions from such hosts.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Title of the InventionFungal Promoters Active in the Presence of GlucoseCross-Reference to Related ApplicationsThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application No. 07/496,155 filed March 19, 1990.Background of the InventionI. Methods for the Identification of PromotersMany systems have been used to isolate genes and their promoters located immediately upstream of the translation start site of a gene. The techniques can roughly be divided in two categories, namely (1) where the aim is to isolate genomic DNA fragments containing promoter activity randomly by so-called promoter probe vector systems and (2) where the aim is to isolate a gQiie perse from a genomic bank (library) and isolation of the corresponding promoter follows therefrom. In promoter probe vector systems, genomic DNA fragments are randomly cloned in front of the coding sequence of a reporter gene that is expressed only when the cloned fragment contains promoter activity (Neve, R.L. et al, Nature 277:324-325 (1979)). Promoter probe vectors have been designed for cloning of promoters in E. coli (An, G. et al, J. Bad. 740:400- 407 (1979)) and other bacterial hosts (Band, L. et al , Gene 26:313-315 (1983); Achen, M.G., Gene 45:45-49 (1986)), yeast (Goodey, A.R. et al , Mol. Gen. Genet. 204:505-511 (1986)) and mammalian cells (Pater, M.M. et al, J. Mol. App. Gen. 2:363-371 (1984)). Because it is well known in the art that Trichoderma promoters fail to work in E. coli and yeast (e.g. Penttila, M.Ε. et al, Mol. Gen. Genet. 794:494-499 (1984)), these organisms cannot be used as hosts to isolate Trichoderma promoters. Due to the fact that, 

during the transformation of Trichoderma, the transforming DNA integrates into the fungal genome in varying copies in random locations, application of this method by using Trichoderma itself as a cloning host is also unlikely to succeed and would not be practical for efficient isolation of Trichoderma promoters with the desired properties.Known genes can be isolated from either a cDNA or chromosomal gene bank (library) using hybridization as a detection method. Such hybridization may be with a corresponding, homologous gene from another organism (e.g., Vanhanen et al , Curr. Genet. 75:181-186 (1989)) or with a probe designed on the basis of expected similarities in amino acid sequence. If amino acid sequence is available for the corresponding protein, an oligonucleotide can also be designed which can be used in hybridization for isolation of the gene. If the gene is cloned into an expression
