propylene polymer particles having an average particle 

diameter of 3,000 µm or less and containing fine particles

µm gives a film having a good balance between appearance 
and blocking resistance without deteriorating the good 

transparency inherent to polypropylene films.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polypropylene resin composition and the film manufactured therefrom. More
specifically, it relates to a polypropylene resin composition which can provide a film having a good balance between
transparency, and blocking resistance without deteriorating the good appearance inherent to polypropylene films, and
to the film manufactured by using such a polypropylene resin composition.Polyolefin films have a vast variety of uses. For example, they are widely used as materials for packaging various
goods, including foods. In particular, polypropylene films have a high marketable value by virtue of their desirable
physical properties. However, polypropylene films are disadvantageous in packaging, since they undergo so-called
blocking, i.e., undesirable cohesion of the films. In order to prevent the blocking of the films, a fine powder of silica is
usually incorporated into the polypropylene films. EP-A-0447652 discloses a stretchable polypropylene film which contains
polymerised isobutyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate, which act as anti-blocking agents.On the other hand, it is known in the art that polyolefins are obtained by polymerizing an α-olefin in the presence
of certain catalysts such as a system containing titanium trichloride and an organo-aluminum compound. However,
the conventional catalyst systems used in industry exhibit a low polymerization activity. Moreover, polypropylenes
produced by the use of such catalyst systems have a low stereoregularity. They are obtained in the form of powder,
which has a small average particle diameter, a wide particle size distribution and a high content of fine particles. As a
result, the powder undesirably has a large surface area and a low apparent density.In these circumstances, various attempts have been made to develop a high activity catalyst which has a high
polymerization activity and affords polyolefins having high stereoregularity, for example, as disclosed in JP-A-47-34478,
JP-A-49-59094, JP-A-50-126590 and JP-A-50-123182. As the performance of olefin polymerization catalysts is enhanced
toward higher stereoregularity and higher activity by such attempts, the produced polymer particles tend to
have a larger average particle diameter, narrower particle size distribution and greatly lowered content of fine particles.
The development of such catalysts permits the polymer particles produced to have a small surface area and high
apparent density; the particles being easily handled and free from the troubles in production
