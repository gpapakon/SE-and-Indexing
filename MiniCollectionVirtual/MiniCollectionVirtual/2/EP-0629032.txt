<ABSTRACT>
A device for charging or revitalizing one or more sealed 
Ni-Cd batteries comprises a logic microprocessor module 

for controlling the treatment processes over a plurality 
of channels to which the batteries are connected, as well 

as for controlling the device functions. The processes 
are carried out independently of the rated capacity 

characteristics, the charging conditions and the type of 
treatment selected for each channel. 
 
The device provides either the constant-voltage or 
constant-current charge, depending on the temperature 

conditions and allows to reliably ascertain the completion 
of the process for each battery and subsequently maintains 

a trickle charge condition before the process is stopped 
by the operator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for charging and
revitalizing electric batteries, and more particularly
sealed Ni-Cd batteries.Such devices are commonly employed in different sectors in
which an isolated power source is needed, particularly in
electric or electronic field equipments, e.g.
transceivers, portable terminals, remote control devices,
and the like.It is therefore necessary to check with particular care
the conditions of the batteries being used, i.e. their
charge conditions, efficiency and usage level.In most cases it is also indispensable to be able to
charge several batteries in the shortest time as possible,
independently of the type and conditions of each one, as
well as to subject one or more batteries to the so called
revitalization process, i.e. a series of controlled charge
and discharge cycles, that allows to restore the battery
capacity as closest as possible to the original rated
capacity, consistently with the usage level.Namely, it is known that batteries are generally subjected
to a capacity decrease with the increasing of their usage.
This is also true for Ni-Cd batteries and particularly for
the sealed Ni-Cd batteries.At present there are known several different types of Ni-Cd
battery recharging devices, particularly for charging 
the above mentioned sealed type. One of the most relevant
problems to be solved in designing such devices is to
reliably detect when the condition of full charge has been
achieved for any of different types of batteries, thus
preventing their overcharging.This is very important since a wrong determination of the
fully charged condition can lead either to a reduction of
the battery efficiency when the process is early stopped,
or to battery damages when the process is stopped too
late.Dealing with sealed Ni-Cd batteries further requires
caution because of the many factors affecting the
treatment processes. In fact, it is known that the
chemical reactions taking place in most batteries when
excessively charged cause a gas generation. More
precisely, the conventional Ni-Cd batteries generate
hydrogen and oxygen, that are normally discharged into the
atmosphere. On the other hand, in sealed Ni-Cd batteries
there is generated oxygen that is discharged through a
safety valve provided for preventing the battery
explosion, only when an internal over-pressure is reached,
but the escaping gas carries away also part of the
electrolyte, thus reducing the electrical capacity of the
battery.Moreover the chemical reactions in a sealed Ni-Cd battery 
are
