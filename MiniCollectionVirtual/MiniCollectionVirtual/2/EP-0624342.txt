<ABSTRACT>
A medical instrument is provided with enhanced ultrasonic visibility. The medical 
instrument includes an elongate probe or needle for insertion into a patient. Selected locations 

along the instrument are provided with deposits of a material exhibiting a high degree of 
ultrasonic reflectivity. The material includes a matrix of gas bubbles contained in a polymeric 

material. The gas bubbles exhibit high reflectivity of ultrasonar energy.

<DESCRIPTION>
1. Field of the Invention. The subject invention relates to a medical instrument 
used during ultrasound imaging procedures and more particularly to an instrument having at 
least selected regions that are highly reflective of ultrasound energy. 2. Description of the Prior Art. The prior art ultrasound imaging apparatus 
includes a transducer that is operative to both emit and receive ultrasound energy. The 
transducer of the prior art ultrasound imaging apparatus typically is held against the skin of the 
patient and emits ultrasound energy into the patient. A portion of the emitted ultrasound 
energy is reflected back from body structures and is received by the transducer. The 
transducer converts the reflected ultrasound energy signals into electric signals which are 
transmitted to a processor of the prior art apparatus. The prior art apparatus further includes 
a black and white video monitor which displays a real time video image of the body parts from 
which the sound waives have been reflected. Medical procedures often require diagnosis of tissue samples from regions that are 
being ultrasonically imaged. Tissue samples usually are obtained with long needles that are 
placed percutaneously into the area of interest. The doctor or medical technician will attempt 
to observe the needle on the video screen of the ultrasonic imaging apparatus to ensure that a 
tissue sample from the proper location is obtained and to be certain that the sharply pointed 
prior art needle cannula causes no damage. For example, the prior art combination of an 
ultrasonic imaging apparatus and a sharply pointed needle cannula is used for amniocentesis 
where a sample of amniotic fluid must be obtained without contacting the fetus. Medical procedures that utilize ultrasonic imaging are complicated by the poor sonar 
reflectivity of the prior art metallic instruments used during the procedures. More particularly, 
body tissue is reflective of sonar energy, and will appear fairly clearly on the black and white 
video screen of the ultrasonic imaging apparatus. However, a cylindrical metallic instrument, 
such as a biopsy needle, tends to disburse the ultrasonic energy impinging thereon, and hence 
a standard cylindrical metallic instrument is substantially invisible on the monitor of the 
ultrasonic imaging apparatus. Fig. 1 provides a schematic example of this problem. In 
particular, a prior art ultrasonic transducer 100 in Fig. 1 directs ultrasonic energy toward a prior 
art biopsy needle 102. However, the arrows in
