<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an air pump with a compressor part for producing compressed air and an outlet passage (11), which is connected to the compressor space and via which the compressed air flows out, and also a monitoring device for monitoring a predetermined desired value for the air pressure. The air pump is characterized according to the invention in that a pressure-relief valve (21, 22, 23, 24) connected to the compressor space via passages (17, 18) is provided as monitoring device. If the predetermined desired pressure value is exceeded, the pressure-relief valve (21, 22, 23, 24) automatically opens and produces an acoustic signal by compressed air flowing out through a fine bore (37). The user can set this desired pressure value, for example, by turning a part (29) attached to the air pump and provided on the visible side with a scale-like graduation. The advantage of the invention lies in the fact that, in the case of the air pump according to the invention, if the desired pressure value is exceeded, the user is made aware of this without it being necessary for him to observe a pressure gauge during the pump operation.
