<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of alkyl and/or alkenyl 
oligoglycosides by acetalization of glycose with fatty 

alcohols at elevated temperature in the presence of acidic 
catalysts, removal of the water of reaction and working up 

of the reaction mixture, 
characterized in tha
t the reaction 
is carried out in the presence of sulfomonocarboxylic acids 

containing 2 to 8 carbon atoms, carboxylic anhydrides 
thereof and/or mixed cyclic sulfonic/carboxylic anhydrides 

thereof as acidic catalysts. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
sulfoacetic acid, sulfopropionic acid, sulfobutyric acid or 

sulfobenzoic acid is used as the acidic catalyst. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 and 2, 
characterized 
in that
 the acidic catalysts are used in quantities of 0.01 
to 2% by weight, based on the glycose. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterized in that
 glucose is used as the glycose. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 4, 

characterized in that
 fatty alcohols corresponding to 
formula (I) 


R
1
-OH
 
in which R
1
 is a linear or branched alkyl or alkenyl radical 
containing 4 to 22 carbon atoms are used.
