<ABSTRACT>
A visible sealing frame is positioned on the recess edge, and a holding frame joined to it forms a support for the plate. The plate (1) rests loose, with no fixing device, on the holding frame (2a), which has a peripheral and permanently elastic sealing strip (3). The sealing frame (2) is permanently fixed to the plate edges. The distance between the sealing frame and the plate edge is equal to or greater than that between it and the sealing strip on which the plate rests. The strip can fit flush against the sealing frame.

Plate of glass, vitreous ceramic or a similar 
material, in particular for a cooking area in an opening 

in a work surface, having a visible sealing frame positioned 
in the opening and resting on the border of the 

said surface as a base, and a holding frame connected to 
the said frame as a support, on which the plate rests, 

characterized in that the plate (1) rests loosely, 
without a solid connection, on the holding frame (2a), 

which is provided with a peripheral, permanently flexible 
sealing band (3) and the sealing frame (2) is connected 

frictionally, solidly and permanently to the end faces of 
the plate (1), the distance between the sealing frame (2) 

and the end side of the plate (1) being equal to or 
greater than the distance of the sealing frame (2) from 

the sealing band (3) on which the plate (1) rests. 
Plate according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the sealing band bears flush against the sealing frame. 
Plate according to Claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the permanently flexible sealing band consists of 

a temperature-resistant material, in particular of a 
silicone material. 
Plate according to at least one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the sealing band used for the 

permanently flexible mounting of the plate is designed as 
a profile with step-like offsets. 
Plate according to at least one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the sealing band is self-adhesive. 
Plate according to at least one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the sealing band (3) is of a  

 
U-shaped design, can be fitted onto the holding frame and 

is detachably connected to it. 
Plate according to at least one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the sealing band (3) is connected 

to the plate at the factory before transport and 
installation in such a way that it ends at least flush 

with the end face of the plate or projects beyond the 
plate up to at most the dimensions of the opening in 

which the plate is arranged. 
Plate according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the sealing band or a sealing bead is connected 

at the factory before transport and installation to that 
part of the holding frame on which the plate later rests 

in such a way that it ends at least flush with the end 
side of the plate to be fitted in later, or projects 

beyond the latter up to the sealing frame. 
Plate according to Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the frictional connection between the sealing 

frame and the plate takes place by a permanently 
flexible, temperature-resistant adhesive, in particular 

by a silicone adhesive. 
Plate of glass, vitreous glass or a similar 
material, in particular for a cooking area in an opening 

in a work surface, having a vertically running frame part 
and two frame members arranged at right angles thereto, 

one member resting on the border of the opening and the 
other frame member reaching beyond the plate, characterized 

in that the plate (1) is connected frictionally, 
solidly and permanently by its end side to the vertically 

running frame part and bears right up against the frame 
member reaching beyond the plate, without a solid connection, 

by means of a permanently flexible band (3) lying 
in between, the band (3) adjoining flush against the 

vertically running frame part and being wider than the 
distance of the vertically running frame part from the 

end side of the plate (1).
