<ABSTRACT>
The valve arrangement consists of a working valve and a control valve. The working valve has a housing with hydraulic input and output chambers and a hydraulic outlet leading to a hydraulic sink. The output chamber can be selectively connected to or isolated from the input chamber of outlet by an inlet and outlet valve arrangement in the housing. The control valve has a hydraulic input chamber, a hydraulic output chamber and a hydraulic outlet; its output chamber is selectively connected via a controlled valve to its input chamber or outlet. The control valve (65) is mounted directly in the housing (1,4) or in an aperture in the working valve housing. The control valve's hydraulic outlet (21) is connected to that (20) of the working valve (66).
