<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the immunoassay quantification of
thyroxine in a test sample. In particular, the present invention relates to
labelled reagents
for the specific quantification of thyroxine in a test sample, preferably for use in
fluorescence polarization immunoassays.The amino acid 3, 5, 3', 5' - tetraiodo - L - thyronine, commonly called
thyroxine and often referred to as T4, is the predominant iodothyronine secreted
from the thyroid gland. T4 is responsible for regulating diverse biochemical
processes throughout the body, which are essential for normal metabolic and
neural activities. The measurement of serum T4 concentration has become the
common initial test in the diagnosis of altered thyroid function. Several
conditions other than thyroid disease may cause abnormal serum levels of T4.
Among these are pregnancy, estrogenic or androgenic steroids, oral
contraceptives, hydantoins and salicylates, stress, hyper- and hypoproteinemia,
and conditions (hereditary or acquired) which cause alterations in serum levels of
thyroid binding globulin (TBG), the major serum T4 transport system.The concentration of thyroxine in the bloodstream is extremely low and
can only be detected with very sensitive techniques. Approximately 0.05% of the
total circulating thyroxine is physiologically active (i.e. free thyroxine). The
remaining circulating thyroxine is bound to proteins, primarily thyroxine binding
globulin (TBG). Thyroxine will also bind to other binding proteins, particularly,
thyroxine binding pre-albumin and albumin. Early T4 determinations were
indirect measurements of the concentration of protein-bound or butanol-extractable
iodine in serum. Later, competitive protein binding (CPB) assays
were developed. More recently, radioimmunoassay procedures have been
developed which use both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, such as
disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos 4,636,478 and 4,888,296 to Siebert et al., which
disclose radioimmunoassay for thyroxine using specific monoclonal antibodies
recognizing L-thyroxine. In general, radioimmunoassay procedures in the art
measure counts of radioactivity which are related to the binding of the antibody to
L-thyroxine.D-thyroxine is a non-naturally occurring isomer of thyroxine. Both L- and
D- thyroxine are represented by Formula 1 below: 
More recently, fluorescent polarization techniques have been used to assay
for thyroxine. Fluorescent polarization techniques are based on the principle that
a fluorescent labelled compound when excited by linearly polarized
