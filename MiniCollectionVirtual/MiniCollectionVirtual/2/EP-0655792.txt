<ABSTRACT>
A continuous method for making starting, lighting 
and ignition lead-acid battery positive plates and the 

resulting battery is disclosed which utilizes a directly 
cast alloy strip wherein the alloy consists essentially 

of lead, from about 0.02 to 0.05% calcium, from about 0.3 
to about 0.5% tin, and from about 0.02 to 0.05% silver, 

the percentages being based upon the weight of the alloy 
strip, as well as related alloys utilizing calcium and 

strontium or strontium in place of calcium.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to lead-acid batteries and,
more particularly, to grids and plates used in making
such batteries and to the method of making such grids and
plates.Over the last 15 to 20 years or so, there has been
substantial interest in automotive-type, lead-acid
batteries which require, once in service, little, or more
desirably, no further maintenance throughout the expected
life of the battery. This type of battery is usually
termed a "low maintenance" or "maintenance-free battery".
The terminology maintenance-free battery will be used
herein to include low maintenance batteries as well.
This type of battery was first commercially introduced in
about 1972 and is currently in widespread use.A considerable amount of attention over the years
has been given to the type of alloys used for
manufacturing positive and negative grids in such
maintenance-free batteries. When maintenance-free
batteries were first commercially introduced, the
conventional automotive lead-acid battery normally used
grids made from antimony-lead alloys in which the
antimony content ranged from about 3-4.5% by weight of
the alloy composition. Such alloys were capable of being
commercially produced at acceptable rates into battery
grids by the gravity casting production techniques then 
widely used. Moreover, the batteries made using grids of
such alloy compositions had desirable deep discharge
cycling characteristics.However, such high antimony content lead-based
alloys could not be used in grids in maintenance-free
batteries. Thus, the use of such high antimony alloys
resulted in the batteries having undesirable higher
gassing, higher self-discharge on stand, and higher
attendant water loss characteristics. In other words,
batteries with grids made from such alloys accepted high
end of charge current during constant voltage overcharge
so that excessive gas generation occurred. Accompanying
this gas generation was loss of water from the battery
electrolyte.The assignee of the present invention and its
predecessors in interest have been in the forefront of
research relating to alloys and maintenance-free
batteries. Among the patents relating to this subject
are the following U.S. Patents: 4,006,035; 4,007,056;
4,166,155 and 4,456,579.Much commercial interest has centered around the use
of calcium-tin-lead alloys for use in making grids for
maintenance-free batteries. The calcium content in such
alloys for positive grids has varied generally from about
0.06 to about 0.1% by weight of the alloy while the tin
has generally

A continuous method for making SLI lead-acid positive
battery plates which comprises:


providing a directly cast alloy strip with thicknesses in
the range of 0.508 mm to 1.524 mm (0.020 inches to 0.060 inches)

expanded and slit into a grid mesh configuration, said alloy
strip being a lead-based alloy consisting essentially of lead,

from about 0.02 to 0.05% calcium, from about 0.3 to 0.5% tin and
from about 0.02 to 0.045% silver, the percentages being based

upon the weight of the alloy strip,
continuously moving the expanded alloy grid mesh strip into
a pasting zone,
pasting the alloy grid mesh strip in the areas desired with
positive active material while moving the alloy grid mesh strip

through the pasting zone to form a pasted plate strip,
dividing the thus-pasted plate grid mesh strip into
individual positive plates, and
curing the pasted positive plates in an environment
comprising a temperature in the range of 79.4°C to 98.9°C (175°F

to 210°F) and a relative humidity of at least 95% to promote the
development of tetrabasic lead sulfate crystals, the positive

active paste material including a lignosulfonate in an amount of
from 0.005% to 0.04% by weight of the unformed paste to modulate

the size of the tetrabasic lead sulfate crystals developed in
curing.
