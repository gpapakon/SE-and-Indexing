<ABSTRACT>
It is known to provide image tube components with identification patterns. According to the prior art, this identification of image tube components is carried out in such a manner that there are applied on the outside of the glass troughs (10) layers or labels which are particular to the cone and contain the identification data. Due to the additional layers or labels, this technique is, however, exceptionally costly, so that the object consisted in simplifying this method. According to the invention, it is specified to form the respective identification pattern (16) directly in a first function layer which is supported on the inside (19) of the respective image tube components. The method can be carried out in a particularly simple manner when the respective identification pattern (16) is burnt into the first function layer with the aid of the laser.

A picture tube component composed of glass with an 
identification pattern and with at least one function 

layer (12, 13) which is applied to the inside (19) of 
the respective picture tube component (10) and is 

essential for the operation of the picture tube,
 
characterised in that the identification pattern (16) 

is formed by the juxtaposition of two different 
function layers (12, 13) on the surface of the 

respective glass component. 
A picture tube component according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the first function layer is the 

black-matrix layer (12) of the glass trough (10) or the 
inner conductive layer of the picture tube cone. 
A picture tube component according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that relative to the black-matrix 

layer (12) the second function layer is the inner 

reflective coating (13) of the glass trough (10) and 
relative to the inner conductive layer of the picture 

tube cone it is the barium reflector which is formed 
with the activation of the grid. 
A process for identifying picture tube components made 
of glass with function layers (12, 13) which are 

arranged on the inside (19) of the respective picture 
tube component (10) and are essential for the operation 

of the picture tube, characterised in that during or 
after the formation of a function layer (12) which 

adheres directly to the inside (19) of the respective 
picture tube component (10), surfaces are formed which 

are free of this first function layer (12) and that the 
surfaces which are free of this first function layer 

(12) are covered with a further function layer (13) 
which moreover covers the surface of the first function 

layer (12).  
 
A process according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
the surfaces which are free of the first function layer 

(12) are formed by means of a laser by which the 
material from which the first function layer (120 is 

formed is burned away down to the glass of the 
respective picture tube component (10). 
A process according to Claim 5, characterised in that 
the laser burns away the surfaces which are free of the 

first function layer (12) through the wall thickness of 
the respective picture tube component (10) made of 

glass. 
A process according to Claim 5 or 6, characterised in 
that the laser has a wave length of approximately 

1.06 Âµm and a power output of between 15 and 60 watt 
and the laser head maintains a distance of 

approximately 20 cm from the function layer (12) which 
is to be burned away.
