<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid processing
composition for silver halide light-sensitive photographic
materials, a package therefor and a method of processing a
silver halide light-sensitive photographic material by the use
thereof. To be more Specific, the present invention relates
to a tablet-form solid processing composition for silver
halide light-sensitive photographic materials which is
effectively prevented from frictional abrasion and
deterioration in photographic processing performance, and, at
the same time, which enables smooth addition upon automatic
addition thereof, a package therefor and a method by the use
thereof. A silver halide light-sensitive photographic material
(hereinafter it is simply called as" the light-sensitive
material") usually undergoes, after imagewise exposure to
light, various photographic processes such as development,
desilvering or bleach-fixing, stabilization and washing, etc.Thus, for example, a developing solution is used for
development; a bleaching solution or a bleach-fixing solution
is used for desilvering process; and a fixing solution is used
for fixing process; city water or deionized water is used for
washing or rinsing; a stabilizing solution is used for
waterless washing; and stabilization solution is used
individually for dye stabilization treatment; etc.The liquid which is used for above-mentioned photographic
processing is called a processing solution, the temperatures
of the respective processing solutions are usually adjusted at
between 30°C and 40°C, and the light-sensitive material is
transported and dipped in these processing solutions and is
processed.The photographic processing like above is usually carried
out using an automatic processing machine, which is herein
after referred to as "a processor". Photographic processing
is carried out by transporting a light-sensitive material into
a plurality of processing baths where the above-mentioned
processing solutions are contained. Herein, the term "processor" generally means a processing
apparatus which comprises a plurality of processing baths
containing various processing solutions as mentioned above,
and a drying compartment; and a means to automatically
transport the photographic light-sensitive material. The
processor has a means to automatically transport the
photographic light-sensitive material through the processing
baths in order.When a light-sensitive photographic material is processed
using a processor like this, in order to keep the activity of
a processing solution in the
