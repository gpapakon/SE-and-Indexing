<ABSTRACT>
Anti-copying film (2) for covering documents (1), which for the purpose of protection against copying is opaque in vertical plan view (5) owing to total reflection and appears transparent in a slanting (oblique) direction (6) of view. The film has an irregular saw-toothed structure (3). As a result, it is virtually impossible to produce an identical second film which could be laid down to cancel the effect of the anticopying film (2).

<CLAIMS>
An anticopying film for covering documents, consisting of a 
film (2) which comprises a transparent material, has a size 

corresponding to that of the document (1) to be covered or 
parts thereof and, as a result of a sawtooth-like structure 

(3), has defined regions of a medium (4) optically thinner 
than the film material, said regions facing the document (1) 

to be covered, so that the film (2) appears opaque in an 
angular range corresponding to the plan view (5), owing to 

total reflection at the sawtooth-like interface, and appears 
transparent when viewed in angular ranges (6) differing 

therefrom, wherein the sawtooth-like structure (3) is irregular 
at least in parts. 
An anticopying film as claimed in claim 1, wherein the sawtooth-like 
structure (3) is aperiodic. 
An anticopying film as claimed in claims 1 and 2, wherein 
that surface of the film which faces away from the document 

(1) also possesses a sawtooth-like structure (3'). 
An anticopying film as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein those flanks (9) of the sawtooth structure (3, 3') 

which face the viewer (8) of the document (1) are arranged at 
least roughly at right angles to the particular beam path 

(16) of the direction of observation (6).  
 
An anticopying film as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein that surface (11) of the film (2) which faces away 

from the document (1) to be covered is roughened in a direction 
at right angles to the sawtooth-like structure (3). 
An anticopying film as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein adhesive (17) is applied randomly in the form of 

points to that side of the film (2) which faces the document 
(1). 
An anticopying film as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein adhesive (18) is applied in the form of strips and 

transversely to the sawtooth direction (3) to that side of 
the film (2) which faces the document (1).
