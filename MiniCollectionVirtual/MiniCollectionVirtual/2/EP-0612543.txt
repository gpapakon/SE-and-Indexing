<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a vibration damping device for an alpine ski with at least one layer (7) of viscoelastic material and with a covering (9) which is fastened to the upper side (1a) of a ski (1) and, with this upper side (1a), encloses a space for the layer of viscoelastic material. The damping device (10) is arranged in a section between a ski binding and the blade of the ski. The aim of the invention is to make the damping device (10) more simple in construction and to bring about its arrangement on the ski (1) in such a manner that the bending characteristic of the ski (1) is influenced less. According to the invention, only the layer (7) of viscoelastic material is fastened on the upper side (1a) of the ski (1). The covering (9) is fastened on the upper side (1a) of the ski (1) only with its front and rear end sections (9a), the front end section (9a) of the covering (10) having a U-shaped projection (9c) which is passed through by a single holding screw (6) and holds this end section (9a) of the covering (9) on the upper side (1a) of the ski (1) so as to be slidably movable and secured against lifting off.

A combination of a vibration dampening device (10) with 
an alpine ski (1), comprising at least one layer (7) of a 

visco-elastic material and a cover (9) secured to the top 
face (1a) of said ski (1), preferably by means of screws (5, 

6) so as to define, together with said top face (1a), a 
space having said layer (7) of visco-elastic material disposed 

therein, said layer (7) of visco-elastic material 
being secured, preferably adhesively, to said top face (1a) 

of said ski (1), and said cover (9,9;9'') having only its 
front and rear end portions (9a,9'a;9''b) secured to said top 

face (1a) of said ski (1), one of said end portions (9a,9'a; 
9''b) of said cover (9,9',9'') being slideably held down on 

said top face (1a,1'a) of said ski (1,1') by a retaining 
fixture, characterized in that said dampening device (10) is 

disposed on a longitudinal section between the location of 

a front clamp assembly (2) of a ski binding and the front 
end portion of said ski (1), and that said retaining fixture 

is provided selectively at the front (9a,9'a) or the rear 
(9''b) end portion of said cover (9,9') in the form of a 

single attachment (9c) of U-shaped configuration when viewed 
from above, or of a single elongate hole (9'c), with a 

single retaining screw (6,6') passing therethrough. 
The combination of a vibration dampening device with an 
alpine ski according to claim 1, characterized in that said 

dampening device (10,10',10'') is disposed on said ski (1,1') 
on a section thereof located immediately forward of said 

front clamp assembly (2) of said ski binding. 
The combination of a vibration dampening device according 
to claim 1, characterized in that the vertical height 

(H) of said dampening device (10,10';10'') as compared to its 
transverse width (B) is between 10 and 40% of said width.  

 
The combination of a vibration dampening device according 
to claim 1, characterized in that the side faces (9d) of 

said cover (9), or tangents (t) applied to said side faces 
(9d), respectively, extend at an acute angle (α) of 10° to 

80°, preferably of 40° to 60°, to the base (9e) of said 
dampening device (10). 
The combination of a vibration dampening device according 
to claim 1, 2 or 4, characterized in that said side 

faces (9d) of said cover (9) is in loose contact with said 
top face (1a) of said ski (1) or defines a narrow gap (s) 

with said top face (1a). 
The combination of a vibration dampening device according 
to claim 1, characterized in that said front end portion 

(9'a) of said cover (9') is formed with a crank-shaped offset 
facing towards said top face (1'a) of said ski (1'), 

said ofset end portion (9'a) being slidably guided by its 
elongate hole (9'c) on the shaft (6'b) of said retaining 

screw (6') and held down on said ski (1') directly by the 
head (6'c) of said retaining screw (6'). 
The combination of a vibration dampening device according 
to claim 6, characterized in that above said elongate 

hole (9'c) said front end portion (9'a) of said cover (9') 
is provided with a longitudinal slot (9'f) adapted to have a 

lid (9'g) removably inserted thereinto. 
The combination of a vibration dampening device according 
to claim 1, characterized in that said layer (7) of 

visco-elastic material is adhesively secured to said top 
face (1a) of said ski (1) by meand of an adhesive acrylic 

foam tape (8), and is in addition adhesively secured to 
said cover (9) as per se known.
