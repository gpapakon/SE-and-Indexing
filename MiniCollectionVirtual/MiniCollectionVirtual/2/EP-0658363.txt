<ABSTRACT>
A porous ceramic filter has properties such that 
a porosity of the filter is more than 45% and less than 

60%, a volume of pores having a pore size of less than 
40 µm is more than 60% of total volume of pores of said 

ceramic filter and an inequality of 1000M+85N≧530 is 
satisfied, wherein M (m²/g) is a specific surface of 

total pores continued from a surface to an inner portion 
of the filter and N (µm) is a surface roughness of a 

surface of the filter. Preferably, the porous ceramic 
filter has a thermal expansion 
coefficient of less than 
0.5×10⁻⁶/°C within a temperature range of 40∼800°C in a 

direction parallel to a flow passage of the filter. 
The porous ceramic filter according to the invention is 

preferably used for pliminating soots in an exhaust gas 
from a diesel engine, and has a long operating time and 

a less frequency of a filter regeneration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a porous
ceramic honeycomb filter suitable for removing soot
in an exhaust gas from a diesel engine.Porous ceramic honeycomb filters made of
cordierite have an excellent heat resistivity as
compared with the other materials, and thus they are
effective for a filter used at high temperatures.
For example, porous ceramic honeycomb filters are used
as a filter for collecting soot in an exhaust
gas of a diesel engine.As important properties of the porous ceramic
honeycomb filters, there are three factors such as soot
trapping efficiency, operating time and pressure loss.
Among these three factors, it is preferred to make the
operating time longer, since the operating time means a
time during which soot collection can be performed under
a predetermined pressure loss. If the operating time is
made longer, the number of filter regenerations is
decreased, and thus filter deterioration can be
reduced. The operating time can be easily made 
longer, if a large number of holes are formed in wall
portions of the filter. However, it is not
preferred to form a large number of holes in the wall
portions, since the trapping efficiency is decreased.In order to improve filtration properties,
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 61-129015
(JP-A-61-129015) discloses a method of controlling a
ratio of the amount of small pores having a pore size of
5∼40 µm and the amount of large pores having a pore size
of 40∼100 µm, both pores being opened in a filter
surface. However, in this method, it is necessary to
add pore-forming agents so as to control pores in the filter
surface, a total cost becomes larger. Moreover, since
there is no means for eliminating the increase of
pressure loss, the engine load becomes larger.Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication
No. 3-284313 (JP-A-3-284313) discloses a method of
improving a trapping efficiency by performing pore
control by controlling grain size distributions of talc
and silica in raw materials for cordierite generation
such that particles having a particle size of more than
150 µm are less than 3 wt% with respect to the total
weight and also particles having a particle
size of less than 45 µm are less than 25 wt%. In this
method, in order to improve the trapping efficiency, not
only talc and silica but also kaolin and alumina are 
used as coarse raw materials. Under the condition
that coarse kaolin and alumina are used, it is possible
to improve the trapping efficiency by controlling grain
size distributions of talc and silica. However, since
