<ABSTRACT>
In an attachment construction for filter housings, in particular for attaching air filter housings to motor vehicles, the assembly effort for attaching the filter housing is to be decreased. For this purpose, the attachment construction is designed as a latch or snap joint. Damping elements are integrated into the joint parts of the attachment construction. Specifically, the joint consists of a clip which is elastically deformable and has a U-shaped cross-section with an undercut and a cylindrical or rod-shaped part which can engage in the clip, the one joint part being connected to the filter housing and the other joint part being connected to the vehicle.
