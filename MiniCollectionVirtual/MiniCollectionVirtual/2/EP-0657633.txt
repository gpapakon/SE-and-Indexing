<ABSTRACT>
In order to ensure ease of filling and checking of the filling level in a partially filled evaporation cooling system, it is proposed to use a cross-flow condenser as condenser (9), to the outlet side condensate collector (11) of which a laterally connected reservoir (17) is fixed in one piece. The said reservoir (17) is connected by way of a passage (18) in its lower area to the lower area of the condensate collector (11). From its upper area a venting line (21) branches off into the condensate collector (11) up to the filling level (I) for the cold internal combustion engine.

A partially filled evaporation cooling system for internal combustion engines 
with a condenser and a reservoir for liquid condensate which is connected 

to the ambient environment via a connecting line,
 
characterised in that the reservoir (17) is arranged on the side of the 

condenser (9) and forms an integral part of the condenser (9), that the 
reservoir (17) extends to the base of the neighbouring condensate collecting 

box (11), that a flow connection (18) is provided in this region between the 
reservoir (17) and the condensate collecting box (11) and that a ventilation 

line (21) extends from the upper region of the reservoir (17) into the 
neighbouring condensate collection box (11) up to the fill level I when the 

internal combustion engine (1) is cold. 
A partially filled evaporation cooling system according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that a restrictor (20) is arranged in the reservoir (17) at the 

start of the ventilation line (21). 
A partially filled evaporation cooling system according to claim 1 or claim 2,
 
characterised in that the reservoir (17) is sealed by a cover (22) with a 

pressure relief valve. 
A partially filled evaporation cooling system according to any one of the 
preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the condenser (9) is a crossflow condenser. 
A partially filled evaporation cooling system according to one of the 
preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the reservoir (17) has at least partially transparent outer 

walls.  
 
A partially filled evaporation cooling system according to one of the 
preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the start of the ventilation line (21) lies below the inlet 

(8) for vapour in the condenser (9). 
A partially filled evaporation cooling system according to one of the 
preceding claims,
 
characterised in that a level switch is built into the base of the reservoir.
