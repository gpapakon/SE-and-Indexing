<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are a color image-formable material which comprises 
a support, a cushion layer provided on the support 

and a color light-sensitive layer containing a light-sensitive 
composition and a coloring agent provided on the cushion 

layer and gives a transferred image by forming a color 
image portion by imagewise exposure 
and developing treatment 
and then transferring the color image portion alone to 

an image-receiving material,
 

   wherein the cushion layer has a hardness of 40 to 85 
and a thickness of 15 µm to 100 µm,

 
and a process for preparing the same.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a color image-forming method
suitable for preparing a color proof for color correction
in color printing,
particularly to a color image-forming method by which
transfer to various image-receiving materials can be
effected irrespectively of paper quality and the kind of
image-receiving materials and the process for preparing the
same.It has been well known in this field that a
color sheet (also called a color proof) for color correction
is used for the purpose of saving labor and time for
proof printing which is carried out as a previous step of
final printing in multicolor printing.As a method of forming a multicolor transferred image by
using a color sheet for color correction, there may be mentioned,
for example, a direct transfer method in which a
color image is directly transferred to and laminated on a
final image-receiving paper described in Japanese Provisional
Patent Publication No. 41830/1972, an indirect 
transfer method in which a color image is temporarily
transferred to a temporary (image-receiving) sheet
described in Japanese Provisional Patent Publications No.
97140/1984 and No. 189535/1986 and a method of repeating
steps of transferring a color light-sensitive layer to an
image-receiving paper and then forming an image described
in Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 50127/1981.In all of the methods described above, the surface of an
image-receiving material on which an image is formed is
covered with an organic polymer layer so that gloss of the
surface of the resulting image is too high, whereby there
is a problem of giving an impression different from quality
of an image obtained by final printing. Particularly in
the method of Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No.
189535/1986, a non-image portion is covered with an organic
polymer layer (a polymer layer), whereby there is a problem
that inherent gloss and feel of a material cannot be
obtained.In order to solve the above problems, there has been proposed
a method in which only a color image is transferred
to and laminated on an image-receiving material to obtain a
multicolor image (Japanese Provisional Patent Publication
No. 48248/1991). In this method, an image-receiving material
is not covered with an organic polymer layer so that
in principle, it is possible to obtain an image extremely
close to the quality of an image obtained by final printing.
The present inventors have found that in a color
image-forming material used in a method of transferring
only an image portion, only the image is

<CLAIMS>
A method for forming a colour image comprising

image wise exposing a colour image-forming material
which comprises a support having provided thereof, in

order, a cushion layer and a colour light-sensitive layer
comprising a light-sensitive composition and a colouring

agent,
developing the exposed colour image-forming material
so as to remove a non-image portion and retain an image

portion, and
transferring the image portion of the light-sensitive
layer alone to an image receiving material,
wherein the cushion layer has a hardness measured by
the Shore hardness tester of from 40 to 85 and a thickness

of from 20 to 50 µm.
A method according to claim 1, wherein the
cushion layer has a hardness of from 40 to 80.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the
peeling strength of the cushion layer and the support is

5.9 gf/mm (150 gf/inch) or more.
A method according to any preceding claim,
wherein the cushion layer comprises a natural rubber or a

synthetic rubber.
A method according to claim 4, wherein the
synthetic rubber is at least one of a thermoplastic rubber,

an ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymer resin, a polybutadiene
rubber, a styrene-butadiene copolymer, an acrylonitrile-butadiene 

copolymer, a polyisoprene rubber resin, a
styrene-isoprene copolymer, an acrylate copolymer and a

polyurethane co-condensed rubber.
