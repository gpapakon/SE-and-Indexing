<ABSTRACT>
Land vehicle navigation apparatus (10) includes 
computer (11) for calculating first and second 

navigation routes (1, 2, or 3) between start (72) and 
destination (73) locations. Both routes are preferably 

visible to vehicle operator at same time along with 
route criteria such as route travel mileage and/or route 

estimated travel time. Vehicle operator selects which 
displayed route is used for providing route guidance 

information to the desired destination. Routes may be 
displayed in different colours as a graphic map display 

(70) on a CRT. Second navigation route is calculated 
after calculating first route, preferably by excluding 

some road path segments (1D) included in the first 
route. Preferably criterion to be used for second route 

calculation is determined prior to calculation of first 
route. Preferably vehicle operator has a choice of 

routes for route guidance to a destination without 
requiring operator input after calculation of the first 

route to specify how to obtain second route.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of land 
vehicle navigation route apparatus in which a desired 
route is calculated between a start location and a 
desired destination location. More specifically, the 
present invention relates to navigation apparatus for 
calculating a route, via fixed road paths, which may be 
used to provide route guidance information to an 
operator of a land vehicle. Many prior land vehicle navigation route apparatus 
are known in which a desired route between a start 
location and a desired destination location are 
calculated via fixed road path segments. In such prior 
systems, typically a vehicle operator will specify his 
desired destination location. The prior system then 
determines the start position of the vehicle, or this 
information may also be input to the system by the 
vehicle operator. Prior systems then use stored road 
map data to select an optimum route between the start 
and destination location. This optimum route is 
selected according to a predetermined criterion which 
strives for either minimum distance or minimum time. 
The route is calculated by considering various 
characteristics associated with the road path segments 
that may be utilized in the route wherein such 
characteristics are stored along with the map data that 
defines the location of the road path segments. Many of the above noted prior navigation systems 
allow the vehicle operator to specify route preferences 
for the route to be calculated. Thus, for example, the  
 
vehicle operator may specify that he prefers multiple 
lane road paths and expressways, and the navigation 
apparatus will accommodate these desires in calculating 
the navigation route. Some systems also allow the 
vehicle operator to specify detours which are defined as 
specific road segments or areas to be avoided during the 
navigation route. Typically, all of these preferences 
and detours (exclusions) are specified prior to the 
calculation of a navigation route. The navigation 
apparatus then proceeds to calculate the single optimum 
navigation route between the start and destination 
locations. If the vehicle operator does not like the 
calculated optimum route, he then has to enter 
additional preference or detour (exclusion) information 
and the route calculation will then take place all over 
again. Since typically the route calculation step is a 
lengthy time consuming step and calculation of an 
alternate route occurs after the operator specifies 
additional information, this slows down the trip 
plann

<CLAIMS>
Land vehicle multiple navigation route apparatus 
comprising: 


a) means (11, 35) for calculating and storing a 

first desired navigation route (1A-1F) for a vehicle, 
via fixed road path segments, between a start location 

(72) and a desired destination location (73), said means 
for calculating and storing a first desired navigation 

route further determining at least one of travel mileage 
and estimated time for said first route; 
b) means (11, 35, 41-43) for calculating and 
storing at least a second desired navigation route 

(2A-2F), different from said first route (1A-1F), 
between said start (72) and destination (73) locations 

and further determining at least one of travel mileage 
and estimated time for said at least a second route; 
c) display means (18, 37), coupled to said first 
and second route calculating and storing means, for 

visually displaying to a vehicle operator, in a 
predetermined display format, each of said first and 

said at least a second desired navigation routes along 
with at least one of the travel mileages and estimated 

times for each of the displayed routes, each of the 
displayed said first and said at least a second routes 

being visible at the same time; 
d) selection means for said vehicle operator to 
select any one of the displayed said first route and 

said at least a second route; 
e) means (15, 16, 37) for selecting the display 
format in which said display means will visually display 

each of said first route and said at least a second 
route, said first route and said at least a second route 

being displayable in a text format in which a route is 
identified by text which identifies major road segments, 

rather than providing a graphic map path display between  
 

visually displayed start and destination locations, and 
a graphic display format in which a graphic map path is 

visually displayed between visual displays of the start 
and destination locations. 
Land vehicle multiple navigation route apparatus 
according to claim 1, further including selection means 

(15, 16, 39) for said vehicle operator to select said 
first route prior to the display of said at least a 

second route.
