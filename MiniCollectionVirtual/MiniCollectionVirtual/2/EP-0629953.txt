<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for graphical manipulation of 
encryption. In one embodiment, the invention provides an 

encryption work area window within a graphical user interface. 
A user may encrypt an unencrypted object by dropping an icon 

associated with the unencrypted object on the encryption work 
area. An encrypted object located within the encryption work 

area is decrypted when opened and encrypted when closed. An 
encrypted object located within the encryption work area is 

decrypted if it is dragged and dropped outside the encryption 
work area and decryption is selected; alternatively, the 

encryption of the encrypted object is maintained if it is dragged 
and dropped outside the work area and maintain encryption is 

selected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to data processing systems and
in particular to data processing systems that provide graphical
user interfaces that permit direct manipulation operations.A data processing system may permit the encryption of files
or objects resident in the data processing system. Known
encryption methods may utilize a sequence of symbols, called a
key or a cryptographic key, with a cryptographic algorithm to
encrypt or decrypt data. Various cryptographic algorithms use the
same key for both encryption and decryption, while other
cryptographic algorithms use separate keys for encryption and for
decryption. Encryption of files enhances data processing
security; however, it is cumbersome as an encrypted file must be
decrypted before the contents of the file can be accessed or
utilized by the data processing system.A user interface is desired that renders the encryption and
decryption of files and objects unintrusive to the user and
permits encrypted files and objects to be manipulated, encrypted,
decrypted and accessed by the data processing system with a
minimum of user involvement beyond that required for unencrypted
files and objects. In accordance with the invention, a method and apparatus are
provided for graphical manipulation of encryption. In one
embodiment, the invention provides an encryption work area window
within a graphical user interface. A user may encrypt an
unencrypted object by dropping an icon associated with the
unencrypted object on the encryption work area. An encrypted
object located within the encryption work area is decrypted when
opened and encrypted when closed. An encrypted object located
within the encryption work area is decrypted if it is dragged and
dropped outside the encryption work area and decryption is
selected; alternatively, the encryption of the encrypted object
is maintained if it is dragged and dropped outside the work area
and maintain encryption is selected.The novel features believed characteristic of the invention
are set forth in the appended claims. The invention itself,
however, as well as a preferred mode of use, further objects and
advantages thereof, will best be understood by reference to the
following detailed description of an illustrative detailed
embodiment when read in conjunction with the accompanying
drawings, wherein:
Figure 1 is a block diagram of an apparatus used in
performing the method of a preferred embodiment of the present
invention and forming a part of the apparatus of a preferred
embodiment of the present
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method, performed in a data processing system, said
data processing system including an encryption work area,

said encryption work area having an encryption key and a
decryption key associated therewith, the method

characterized in that it comprises the steps of :

encrypting an unencrypted object with the encryption key,
said unencrypted object being associated with an icon

located outside the encryption work area, and displaying
the icon in the encryption work area, whenever the icon

associated with the unencrypted object is dragged from
outside the encryption work area and dropped on the

encryption work area;
decrypting an encrypted object with the decryption key,
said encrypted object being associated with an icon

located within the encryption work area, whenever the
encrypted object is opened;
encrypting, with the encryption key, an open unencrypted
object associated with the encryption work area whenever

the open unencrypted object is closed;
decrypting an encrypted object with the decryption key,
said encrypted object being associated with an icon

located within the encryption work area, and displaying
the icon associated with the encrypted object outside the

encryption work area, whenever the icon associated with
the encrypted object is dragged from the encryption work

area and dropped outside the encryption work area and
decryption is selected and the decryption key is

provided;
maintaining the encryption of an encrypted object, said
encrypted object being associated with an icon located

within the encryption work area, and displaying the icon 
associated with the encrypted object outside the

encryption work area, whenever the icon associated with
the encrypted object is dragged from the encryption work

area and maintaining encryption is selected; and
decrypting an encrypted object with the decryption key,
said encrypted object being associated with an icon

located outside the encryption work area, whenever the
encrypted object is opened and the decryption key is

provided.
The method of claim 1, wherein an unencrypted object
includes an object encrypted with an encryption key that

is not identical to the encryption key associated with
the encryption work area.
The method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein at least
one of the selections of decrypting an encrypted object

and maintaining the encryption of an encrypted object is
selectable through the use of an augmentation key during

a drag and drop operation.
The method according to anyone of the preceding claims,
wherein one of the selections of decrypting an encrypted

object and maintaining the encryption of an encrypted
object is a default selection.
The method according to anyone of the preceding claims,
wherein the icon that is associated with an encrypted

object and that is also located outside the encryption
work area includes a visible indication that the

encrypted object is encrypted.
The method according to anyone of the preceding claims,
further comprising the computer implemented step of 

encrypting an unencrypted object with the encryption key
whenever an icon associated with the encryption work area

is dropped on an icon associated with the unencrypted
object.
A data processing system comprising means for carrying out the steps of the method
according to any one of the preceding claims.
