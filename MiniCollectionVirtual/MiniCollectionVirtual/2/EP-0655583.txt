<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for controlling and monitoring a combustion installation (20), the working point of the combustion installation (20) being checked cyclically as to whether its setting ensures the lowest possible oxygen excess in the exhaust gas. The sensors (2 and 3) used and the O2 control are likewise checked cyclically for their serviceability.

Method for controlling and monitoring combustion 
of a combustion plant (20)
 for flowing gaseous or liquid 
fuels, downstream of which a hydrogen sensor (2) and an 

oxygen sensor (3) are connected, characterized in that, 
in order to check the working point of the combustion 

plant to ensure that complete combustion just takes 
place, the air supply to the combustion plant (20) is 

reduced to such an extent that the residual proportion of 
oxygen in the exhaust gas is reduced by X%, in that the 

difference U
d
 = U
n
 - U
v
 is formed from the voltage signals 
U
v
, U
n
 of the hydrogen sensor (3) which are measured 
before and after the reduction in the proportion of 

oxygen in the exhaust gas (22) and the said difference is 
compared with a limit value, in that the proportion of 

oxygen in the exhaust gas (22) is reduced incrementally 
by X% until the difference voltage U
d
 which is formed is 
greater than the prescribed limit value, in that, after 

this, the supply of oxygen to the combustion plant (20) 
is increased to such an extent that the residual proportion 

of the oxygen in the exhaust gas is increased by D% 
and thus complete combustion just takes place, the values 

X% = 0.1% and D% = 0.3% being selected, and in that this 
setting is used as a new working point for the next test, 

and the monitoring of this setting, the monitoring of the 
O
2
 control system and that of the hydrogen sensor and of 
the oxygen sensor takes place cyclically. 
Method for controlling and monitoring the combustion 
of a combustion plant (20) for flowing gaseous or 

liquid fuels, downstream of which a hydrogen sensor (2) 
and oxygen sensor (3) are connected, characterized in 

that the supply of air to the combustion plant (20) is 
reduced in such a way that the residual proportion of the 

oxygen in the exhaust gas is reduced by X%, in that the 
difference U
d
 = U
n
 - U
v
 is formed from the voltage signals 
U
v
, U
n
 of the hydrogen sensor (3) which are determined 
before and after the reduction, and the quotient U
d
/X% is 
formed from the said difference with the percentile  

 
proportion of X% of the reduced quantity of oxygen, in 

that this quotient is compared with a prescribed limit 
value and the reduction of the residual oxygen in the 

exhaust gas is carried out incrementally by X% until the 
quotient is greater than the prescribed limit value, and 

in that, subsequently, the supply of air to the combustion 
plant (20) is increased to such an extent that the 

residual proportion of the oxygen in the exhaust gas is 
increased by D% and thus complete combustion just takes 

place, the values X% = 0.1% and D% = 0.3% being selected, 
and in that this setting is used as the new working point 

until the next test, and the monitoring of this setting, 
the monitoring of the O
2
 control system as well as that 
of the hydrogen sensor and of the oxygen sensor take 

place cyclically. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that, in order to check the O
2
 control system 
with increased voltage signal (U) of the hydrogen sensor 

(3), resetting of the working point is performed, in 
that, when a new working point is not reached, the supply 

of air to the combustion plant (20) is increased mechanically 
to such an extent that the combustion takes place 

with excess air, in that, when this results in a reduction 
in the voltage signal (U) of the hydrogen sensor, a 

message is output that the oxygen control system is 
defective, and in that, when a reduction in the voltage 

signal (U) is not achieved in this way, a message is 
output that the hydrogen sensor (3) is defective, and in 

that, when the oxygen sensor (2) is defective or the 
hydrogen sensor (3) is defective, a message is additionally 

output that the combustion plant should continue 
to operate a mechanically set excess-air setting. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that, in order that the sensors (2 and 3) 

check one another, the air supply to the combustion plant 
(20) is increased to such an extent that the residual 

proportion of oxygen in the exhaust gas (22) rises to V%, 
V% lying between 6.5% and 9%, in that, when this results 

in a voltage signal (U) of the hydrogen sensor (3)  
 

outside the permissible interval, a fault signal H
2
 
sensor defective is output, in that the combustion plant 

is operated according to a permanently programmed characteristic 
diagram with a smallest possible oxygen excess 

in the exhaust gas. 
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that, given a voltage signal of the hydrogen sensor (3) 

in the permissible range after the proportion of oxygen 
in the exhaust gas (20) has been increased to V%, the air 

supply to the combustion plant (20) is set in three 
stages to R%, S% and T% of the residual proportion of 

oxygen in the exhaust gas (20), in that the associated 
oxygen value is determined from the respectively measured 

voltage signals (U
R
, U
S
 and U
T
) of the hydrogen sensor (3) 
at R%, S% and T% proportion of oxygen in the exhaust gas, 

from the characteristic curve of the oxygen sensor (3), 
in that the calculated oxygen values are compared with 

the measured oxygen values in the exhaust gas, and when 
they do not correspond a fault message: oxygen sensor (2) 

or hydrogen sensor (3) defective and the combustion plant 
(20) is operating with an excessive air excess, is 

output, in that, when they do correspond the quantity of 
air supplied to the combustion plant (20) is briefly 

reduced to such an extent that the proportion of oxygen 
in the exhaust gas is reduced to U%, in that, when the 

voltage signal of the hydrogen sensor (3) rises, a 
message: hydrogen sensor (3) satisfactory, is output, and 

in that, otherwise, a fault report: hydrogen sensor (3) 
defective, is output and the combustion plant is operated 

according to a permanently programmed characteristic 
curve in such a way that the exhaust gas (22) has the 

smallest possible oxygen excess, the values R% = 7%, S% 
= 5%, T% = 3%, U% = 0.8% and V% between 6.5% and 9% being 

selected.
