<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a washable scraper carpet, that is 
a carpet incorporating stiff fibres of a scraper 

material, which method includes the steps of bringing 
the length of scraper carpet material into contact 

with a corresponding length of uncured rubber material 
such as a rubber nitrile material, applying heat to 

the uncured rubber material for a short period at a 
temperature between 80째C and 120째C to enable the 

the rubber viscosity to reduce to a level where the 
rubber material can flow round the stiff fibres, and 

applying heat and pressure to the carpet material to 
enable the rubber material to laminate to the carpet 

material, so as to be cured, and to bond to the 
monofilaments and form a backing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to scraper carpet 
materials and methods for their manufacture. In GB Patent Specification No. 1,527,622 a form of 
carpeting material is disclosed which utilizes a 
mixture of carpet fibres and fibres of a stiff 
material. The carpet fibres may be any fibres 
conventionally used for carpets such as nylon, 
acrylic, regenerated cellulose, wool, polyester, 
cotton or polypropylene fibres or mixtures of these 
and the stiffer filaments are preferably heavy 
monofilaments for example of nylon polyester or 
unplasticised polypropylene. Such a carpet material 
is generally used as entrance mats in office buildings 
stores and the like where very heavy traffic arises 
and it is desirable to provide a high level of 
scraping to the underside of the shoes of those 
passing across the entrance.  The present invention is concerned with providing a 
form of carpet material of this kind having a rubber 
backing. Moreover, since such materials can be 
heavily soiled in use, it is desirable that they 
should be capable of being thoroughly cleaned for 
example by washing. This however creates a problem 
because during washing, the stiff fibres tend to be 
washed out of the carpet material. The invention is concerned with solving this 
problem. Accordingly, the invention provides a method of 
forming a washable scraper carpet comprising the steps 
of forming a quantity of scraper carpet material 
comprising a mixture of carpet fibres and stiff fibres 
of a scraper material, characterised by the steps of 
bringing a length of the scraper carpet material into 
contact with a corresponding length of uncured rubber 
material, applying heat to the uncured rubber 
material for a short period at a temperature between 
80 and 120째c to enable the rubber viscosity to reduce 
reduce to a level where the rubber material can flow  
 
round the stiff fibres, and applying heat and 
pressure to the carpet material and the rubber 
material to enable the rubber material to laminate to 
the carpet material, so as to be cured, and to bond 
to the stiff fibres and form a backing. The invention also provides a washable scraper carpet 
formed by the method, that is to say a carpet material 
comprising a mixture of carpet fibres and stiff fibres 
and having a backing of a rubber material which has 
been bonded to the stiff fibres by use of short 
pre-heating step prior to a curing and laminating 
step. Preferably, the rubber material is a rubber nitrile.
