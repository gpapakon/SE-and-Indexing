<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with the present invention, we have discovered 
and purified a protein designated herein as p53as, which protein 

is present in normal cells of a mammal and is essentially 
identical to known normal growth controlling protein p53 of the 

same mammal, at least until the final 50 amino acids of the 
carboxy terminal end of the protein. The invention further 

includes an antibody specific for protein p53as, which antibody 
is designated herein as Ab p53as. The antibody may be either a 

monoclonal or polyclonal antibody and may be specific for p53as 
of any particular mammal such as mice and humans.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to p53 protein and variations
thereof, and more particularly relates to antibodies to such
variations.The p53 gene which encodes for p53 protein is defective in
over half of all human cancers. It is furthermore significant
because introduction of a normal p53 gene into a variety of
cancer cells arrests their growth. Thus, defects in the p53 gene
product (that is, the p53 protein) are common in many cancers
and, if corrected, could inhibit cancer cell growth. In many
human cancers, the p53 protein is inactive because of mutation of
the p53 gene. Replacement of a single amino acid can be
sufficient to change the normal folding of the p53 protein,
making it inactive as a growth control gene. In certain cells,
the folding of a mutant p53 protein can be stabilized in the
normal conformation by binding to cellular factors, suggesting
that it may be possible to create peptides which bind to p53
protein and cause it to be maintained in the normal conformation
(conformations are forms of a protein created due to folding;
conformations can change without (or with) changes in amino acid
sequence). The normal conformation has the tumor suppressor
effect. Cells expressing primarily mutant p53 conformation give
rise to aggressive tumors at high frequency while cells which
primarily express p53 protein in a normal conformation give rise
to slow-growing tumors at low frequency. To date, many studies of p53 protein and its function have
relied upon a specific (PAb421) antibody thereto. Most p53
proteins studied using in vitro (cell-free) assays of binding to
DNA or modulation of transcription have used a p53 protein
purified using PAb421, and thus excluding other proteins. While
p53 binding detectable to date is sequence specific, it is low in
efficiency. A model has been proposed for activation of p53
protein for binding to DNA by modifications at the carboxyl
terminus of p53, Hupp et al. (1992) "Regulation of the specific
DNA binding function of p53", Cell 71, 875-886, as shown in
Figure 1. Modifications include proteolysis (loss of carboxyl
terminal amino acids, phosphorylation of serine in this region or
binding of PAb421 antibody within this region.It has been shown that p53as RNA exists in normal mouse
cells and tissues and in tumor cells (Han et al. (b) (1992),
"Alternatively spliced p53 RNA in transformed and normal cells of
different tissue types", NucleicAcidsRes., 20(8), 1979-1981;
however, no protein has heretofore been found which is encoded by
that RNA.In accordance with the present

<CLAIMS>
A purified protein encoded by the plasmid ATCC 69657 and designated p53as,
which protein is present in normal cells of a mouse and is identical to the

known growth controlling protein p53 of the mouse at least until the final 26
amino acids at the carboxy terminal end of p53, where the p53as protein differs

from the p53 protein in the final 26 amino acids of p53 by being truncated
by 9 amino acids relative to p53 and having amino acids distinct from p53

within its final 17 amino acids, said final 17 amino acids being
