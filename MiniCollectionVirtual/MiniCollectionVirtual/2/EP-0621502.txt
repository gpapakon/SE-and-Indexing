<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to hold a uniform gap of a liquid crystal cell and, 
as a result of the uniform gap thickness, to increase the picture quality of a 

liquid crystal electro-optical device. 
Two kinds of gap materials are included in the sealing portion, and at least one 
of the gap materials consists of glass balls which have almost the same size as 

the sealing gap thickness of a liquid crystal electro-optical device. 
The invention guarantees uniform picture quality in its color tone and contrast.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to controlling the gap thickness of a liquid crystal 
electro-optical device. Figure 2 shows the seating portion structure of a conventional liquid crystal 
electro-optical device. Glass fibers 3 are included in the sealing material 2 for 
determining and maintaining a sealing portion gap of thickness h, and a liquid 
crystal 6 is sealed between upper and lower substrates 1 having transparent 
electrode films thereon. The sealing material 2 includes glass fibers 3 of 1 wt% to sealing material, and 
the diameter of the glass fibers 3 is about 0.4 µm bigger than the desired 
thickness of the sealing gap for controlling its thickness. A pressure of 0.8 
kg/cm² is applied to form the sealing portion. However, the actual gap at the sealing portion usually becomes 0.1 µm to 
0.2 µm narrower than the desired gap; thereby, the gap thickness difference 
between the cell gap k and the sealing portion gap h becomes about 0.2 µm to 
0.3 µm which causes defects such as uneven tone in the conventional liquid 
crystal electro-optical display. If the desired gap thickness is 7.0 µm, 1 wt% of 7.4 µm glass fibers should be 
included in the sealing material and a pressure of 0.8 kg/cm² is required to seal 
the substrates; however, the actual cell gap thickness turns out to be 6.8 µm to 
6.9 µm. The Super Twisted Nematic mode is mostly used for a liquid crystal electro-optical 
device because of its superiority of electro-optical characteristics. 
Uniformity of cell gap thickness is one of the most important qualities required 
for a liquid crystal cell. As Figure 2 shows, cell gap thickness means gap distance between upper and  
 
lower glass substrates and the gap is held by having spacers 5 in the display 
area and glass fibers 3 included in the sealing material 2. Uniformity required 
for a cell gap thickness should be within ± 0.1 µm. Without this cell gap 
uniformity, problems evolve, such as irregular tone or bad contrast in the 
liquid crystal electro-optical device. As Figure 2 shows, there evolves a gap difference between cell gap thickness k 
and sealing portion gap thickness h. This difference is caused at the time of 
crimp, and the sealing portion gap thickness becomes 0.1 µm to 0.2 µm lower 
than the desired gap thickness. Even if bigger particles of glass fiber are used, 
the cell gap thickness is still uneven or worse, which creates an even larger 
color tone difference between the tone of the display area and that of the 
margin area. It was very hard to hold the whole cell gap
