<ABSTRACT>
The alpha blending calculator of the invention 
executes an alpha blending calculation in accordance 

with digital data X, Y, and α. The alpha blending 
calculator includes multiplexers which select one of X 

or Y in accordance with bits of the digital data α, 
respectively, and a calculating section for shifting 

outputs of the multiplexers by a predetermined number 
of bits, respectively, and for calculating a sum of the 

shifted outputs. The calculating section includes 
first level to Nth level adding portions, and an adder 

connected to the outputs of the Nth level adding portion 
for executing a multi-bit addition. Each of the 

first level to the Nth level adding portions receives a 
plurality of stages of data, classifies the plurality 

of stages of data into quotient groups and a remainder 
group, calculates a sum and a carry for each of the 

quotient groups, and outputs the sum, the carry, and 
the stages of data in the remainder group to the next 

level adding portion. The outputs of the multiplexers 
are input as the plurality of stages of data to the 

first level adding portion, and the outputs of the Nth 
level adding portion consist of a sum and a carry.

<DESCRIPTION>
The Present invention relates to an alpha 
blending calculator which executes an alpha blending 
calculation 
αX + (1-α)Y  
 in accordance with given digital 
data X, Y, and α. In recent years, as digital techniques progress, 
images are more frequently processed in the form 
of digital data. In various apparatuses handling such 
digital images, a process called "alpha blending" is 
often used. The various apparatuses include, for example, 
an apparatus for applying special effects to 
images, an apparatus for processing images, and an 
apparatus for producing images. In the alpha blending 
process, two images are blended at a predetermined 
ratio. The alpha blending is accomplished by executing 
an operation of Expression (1) below for every pixel 
included in two images. Hereinafter, the operation 
shown in Expression (1) is referred to as "an alpha 
blending calculation".

P = αX + (1-α)Y   (1) 


 
where X denotes a digital value of a pixel included in 
one image, Y denotes a digital value of a pixel included 
in another image, and α denotes a predetermined 
blending ratio. In order to obtain a single blended image by 
blending two images, it is necessary to execute an  
 
enormous number of alpha blending calculations. This 
means that it is necessary to execute each alpha blending 
calculation at a high speed. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication 
No. 6-83852 discloses a conventional alpha blending 
calculator. Hereinafter, the conventional alpha blending 
calculator will be described with reference to 
Figures 7 and 8. Figure 7 shows the organization of an alpha 
blending calculator which executes an alpha blending 
calculation 
αX + (1-α)Y  
 in accordance with given digital 
data X, Y, and α. Each of the digital data X, Y, 
and α is 4-bit binary data. In Figure 7, X₀ through X₃ 
represent the least significant bit (LSB) to the most 
significant bit (MSB) of the digital data X, respectively. 
Also, Y₀ through Y₃ represent the least significant 
bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB) of 
the digital data Y, respectively. The digital data α 
is a fixed-point number with the binary point to the 
left of the most significant bit (MSB). The least 
significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB) 
of the digital data α are represented by α₀ through α₃, 
respectively. The reference symbols P₀ through P₇ 
represent the least significant bit (LSB) to the most 
significant bit (MSB) of an 8-bit fixed-point number P 
indicative of the result of the alpha blending calculation 
αX + (1-α)Y  
.
