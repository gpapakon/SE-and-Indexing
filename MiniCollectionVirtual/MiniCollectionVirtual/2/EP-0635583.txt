<ABSTRACT>
A liquid deposition source delivery system 
(22) includes a reactant source (50) of a liquid 

chemical reactant, a first heater (54) positioned 
adjacent to the reactant source (50), and a vapor 

collection system (56) in communication with the 
reactant source (50) to collect vapor evolved from 

the reactant source (50). A flow controller (64) 
has an upstream side (66) in communication with the 

vapor collection system (56). A line (70) of a 
vapor distribution system is in communication with 

the downstream side (68) of the flow controller 
(64). A second heater (76) is positioned adjacent 

to the flow controller (64), at least a portion of 
the vapor collection system (56), and at least a 

portion of the vapor distribution system, to prevent 
the vapor from condensing in the lines (70) of the 

delivery system. One purge system (94) is used for 
the upstream side of the flow controller (64) and 

the vapor collection system (56), and a second purge 
system (96) is used for the downstream side of the 

flow controller (64) and the lines (70) of the vapor 
distribution system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the deposition of
thin layers from reactive gases, and, more
particularly, to a system for delivering such gases
to a deposition reactor.In chemical vapor deposition (CVD), one or
more reactive gases is contacted to a substrate that
has been energized, as by heating. With the proper
selection of the reactive gas or gases, the
substrate type and temperature, gas partial and
total pressures, and other operating parameters, the
reactive gases deposit a selected material as a
gradually thickening layer onto the surface of the
substrate. The deposition continues until the
desired thickness is reached.The reactive gases used in the reactive
deposition are provided from either gaseous or
liquid sources. Liquid sources have become
increasingly popular, as the reactive gases are
often safer to handle and less toxic when provided
in their liquid forms. Prior to the reactive
deposition, the liquid source is heated to produce a
vapor of the reactive gas, which is conducted to the
substrate and reacted. From US-A-5 190 913 a liquid deposition source delivery system is known
comprising a reactant source of a liquid chemical reactant, a first heater positioned
adjacent to the reactant source, a vapour collection system in communication with the
reactant source to collect vapour evolved from the reactant source, a flow controller
having an upstream side and a downstream side, a vapour distribution system in
communication with the downstream side of the flow controller and a second heater
positioned adjacent at least a portion of the vapour collection system and at least a
portion of the vapour distribution system.EP-A-390 127 discloses a liquid deposition source delivery system comprising a
reactant source of a liquid chemical reactant, a first heater positioned adjacent to the
reactant source, a vapour collection system in communication with the reactant source
to collect vapour evolved from the reactant source, a flow controller having an upstream
side and a downstream side, a vapour distribution system in communication with the
downstream side of the flow controller, a second heater positioned adjacent to at least a
portion of the vapour collection system and at least a portion of the vapour distribution
system, wherein the upstream side of the flow controller is in communication with the
vapour collection system, and a first gas purge system in communication with the
vapour collection system and the upstream side of the flow controller.US-A-4 582 480 describes a gas delivery system
