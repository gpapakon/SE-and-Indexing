<ABSTRACT>
The process consists in treating a low-calorie soluble polymer of glucose: polyglucose, polydextrose, pyrodextrin, with a glucose oxidase and an anion exchanger in hydroxyl form. It makes it possible to obtain relatively colour-free products which have little or no bitterness, are of high viscosity and are relatively nonhygroscopic. The products obtained can be employed as substitutes for sugar or fats.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the purification of a low-calorie
soluble glucose polymer, characterized in that it consists

in subjecting the said polymer to the action of a glucose
oxidase and then in treating the product obtained with an

anion exchanger of the strong anionic resin type in
hydroxyl OH
-
 form.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in
that it consists in subjecting the low-calorie soluble

glucose polymer to the action of starch-hydrolysing
enzymes prior to its purification, or during the treatment

with glucose oxidase.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in
that it consists in subjecting the low-calorie soluble

glucose polymer to a catalytic hydrogenation subsequent to
its purification.
Process for the purification of a low-calorie
soluble glucose polymer according to claims 1, 2 or 3,

characterized in that it consists in subjecting the low-calorie
soluble glucose polymer to the action of starch-hydrolysing

enzymes before its purification or during its
purification, and in subjecting the low-calorie soluble

glucose polymer thus obtained to a catalytic
hydrogenation.
Process according to claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the low-calorie soluble glucose

polymer is a polyglucose. 
Process according to claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the low-calorie soluble glucose

polymer is polydextrose.
Process according to claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the low-calorie soluble glucose

polymer is a pyrodextrin.
Application of the product obtained according
to one of claims 1 to 7 as a sugar substitute for the

manufacture of confectionery sweets.
Application of the product obtained according
to one of claims 1 to 7 as a substitute for fats.
