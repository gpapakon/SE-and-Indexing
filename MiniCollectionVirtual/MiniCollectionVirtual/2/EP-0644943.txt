<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for
maintaining male-sterile plant lines that can be used
for the production of hybrid seed of a crop, to
maintainer plants that can be used in such a process,
and to maintainer genes that can be used to produce
such maintainer plants.In many, if not most, plant species, the
development of hybrid cultivars is highly desired
because of their generally increased productivity due
to heterosis: the superior performance of hybrid
individuals compared with their parents (see, e.g.,
Fehr (1987) "Principles of Cultivar Development,
Volume 1: Theory and Technique", MacMillan Publishing
Company, New York; Allard (1960) "Principles of Plant
Breeding", John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York).The development of hybrid cultivars of various
plant species depends upon the capability to achieve
almost complete cross-pollination between parents.
This is most simply achieved by rendering one of the
parent lines male-sterile (i.e., with pollen being
absent or nonfunctional), for example, by manually
removing the one parent's anthers or by providing the
one parent with naturally occurring cytoplasmic or
nuclear genes that prevent anther and/or pollen
development and/or function, using classical breeding
techniques (for a review of the genetics of male-sterility
in plants, see Kaul (1988) "Male Sterility
in Higher Plants", Springer Verlag, New York). For hybrid plants where the seed is the
harvested product (e.g., corn and oilseed rape), it
is, in most cases, also necessary to ensure that
fertility of the hybrid plants is fully restored. In
plants in which the male-sterility is under genetic
control, this requires the use of genes that can
restore male-fertility. Hence, the development of
hybrid cultivars is mainly dependent on the
availability of suitable and effective sterility and
restorer genes.Endogenous nuclear loci are known for most plant
species that contain genotypes which effect male-sterility,
and generally, such loci need to be
homozygous for particular recessive alleles in order
to result in a male-sterile phenotype. The presence
of a dominant male-fertile allele at such loci
results in male-fertility.Recently, it has been shown that male-sterility
can be induced in a plant by providing the plant with
a nuclear male-sterility genotype that includes a
chimaeric male-sterility gene comprising a DNA
sequence (or male-sterility DNA) coding, for example,
for a cytotoxic product (such as an RNase) and under
the control of a promoter which is predominantly
active in selected tissue of
