<ABSTRACT>
When a connection (E1) is established through an asynchronous time-division transfer network, a connection bit rate (D
<
p
>
 con) is reserved for the sending terminal in each node forming part of a connection path linking the sending terminal to a receiving terminal. After the connection is established, depending on the requirements of the user, bit rate reservation request cells (E2) each including a word representative of a new bit rate to be reserved (D
<
p
>
 dem) are transmitted through the connection path. In each node of this path, in the event that a sum of the current bit rates reserved does not allow immediate reservation of this new bit rate to be reserved (E6b), the reservation request is not systematically rejected. It is held in memory in a queue in this node (E5a) if the new bit rate to be reserved is lower than the connection bit rate, and the said new bit rate to be reserved is reserved as soon as sufficient capacity is released in the multiplex channel of the connection path associated with this node.

Process for reserving bitrate in the nodes of an
asynchronous transfer mode telecommunications network,

along a connection pathway connecting an emitter
terminal (1
p
) to a receiver terminal (2
q
), comprising,

during an initial phase of requesting the
establishment of the connection pathway, the emission by

said emitter terminal (1
p
) of a connection cell including
an identifier of said connection pathway (VPI, VCI) and

a reservation word representing a connection bitrate to
be reserved (
D
p
con
), said connection not being established
and said connection bitrate (
D
p
con
) not being reserved for
said emitter terminal (1
p
) in the nodes of said
connection pathway unless, in each of the nodes, a sum

of the total (Σ 
D
p
con
) of connection bitrates reserved in
each node and of said connection bitrate (
D
p
con
) is less
than a useful bitrate available in a multiplex channel

leaving each of said nodes and belonging to said
connection pathway, the connection bitrates reserved

being reserved for other terminals and relating to said
multiplex channel, and
during a main phase following the establishment of
the connection pathway and the reserving of said

connection pathway to be reserved (
D
p
con
) in a reserved
connection bitrate, the emission, through said

connection pathway, by said emitter terminal (1
p
), of
bitrate reservation request cells, each including a word

representing a new bitrate to be reserved (
D
p
dem
) in order
to modify a current reserved bitrate (
D
p
res
)
 into a new
reserved bitrate,
one of said reservation request cells relating to a
reduction in bitrate causing, in each said node, a

decrease in the total of current bitrates reserved
amounting to the difference between said current

reserved bitrate (
D
p
con
) and said new bitrate to be
reserved (
D
p
dem
), characterised in that
one of said reservation request cells relating to
an increase in bitrate causes, in each of said nodes, 
on the one hand, when a sum of the total of
current reserved bitrates stored (Σ 
D
p
res
) and of the
difference (
D
p
dem
 - 
D
p
res
) between said new bitrate to be
reserved and said current reserved bitrate is greater

than the said sum (Σ 
D
p
con
) of the total of reserved
connection bitrates, said reservation cell to be stored

in the waiting file if said new bitrate to be reserved
(
D
p
dem
) is less than said connection bitrate (
D
p
con
) or
said reservation cell to be rejected if said new bitrate

to be reserved (
D
p
dem
) is greater than said connection
bitrate (
D
p
con
), and,
on the other hand, when said sum of the total of
the current reserved bitrates stored (Σ 
D
p
res
) and of the
difference (
D
p
dem
 - 
D
p
res
) between said new bitrate to be
reserved and said current reserved bitrate is less than

the said sum of the total of connection bitrates
reserved, an actual increase in said current reserved

bitrate to said new reserved bitrate, if appropriate
after storage in the waiting file and after actual

increases of current reserved bitrates into new reserved
bitrates caused by the reservation request cells

relating to increases in bitrate and stored in the
waiting file preceding said one of the reservation

request cells.
Process for reserving bitrate according to claim 1,
characterised in that, when said new bitrate to be

reserved (
D
p
dem
) is greater than said connection bitrate
(
D
p
con
), there is periodic transmission by said emitter
terminal of a cell for requesting an extension relative

to a request for extending the reservation of bitrate in
each of the nodes of the connection pathway following

said actual increase in said current reserved bitrate
into said new reserved bitrate, and

   in each of said nodes of the connection pathway,
there is rejection or acceptance, respectively, of said

request for an extension of the reservation depending on
whether said waiting file contains or does not contain 

at least one reservation request cell, said rejection of
the request for extension leading to a decrease in said

new bitrate to be reserved (
D
p
dem
) to said connection
bitrate (
D
p
con
).
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that said connection cell further comprises a permanent

bitrate word (
D
p
per
) representing a minimum permanent
bitrate which is allocated in each of said nodes of said

connection pathway to said emitter terminal (1
p
).
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that said cells for requesting an

extension relative to an increase in bitrate are
labelled with priority data (PAD = "0", "1") used

directly by each of said nodes and differing
respectively according to whether said new bitrate to be

reserved (
D
p
dem
) is greater or less than said connection
bitrate (
D
p
con
).
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that, in each of said nodes,

simultaneously with the increase in a current reserved
bitrate to a new reserved bitrate (
D
p
dem
) which is greater
than said connection bitrate (
D
p
con
), a timer is actuated
which establishes a predetermined length of time equal

to a maximum return journey of a cell through said nodes
of the connection pathway, and there is a reduction in

said new reserved bitrate (
D
p
dem
) to said connection
bitrate (
D
p
con
) at the end of said predetermined period,
if a cell for acquittal of the reservation is not

received by each of said nodes.
Process for reserving bitrate according to any one
of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that, when each new

bitrate to be reserved (
D
p
dem
) is greater than said
connection bitrate (
D
p
con
), said cell for requesting a
reservation relative to the increase in bitrate is 

transmitted to all the nodes of the connection pathway
irrespective of an actual increase in said current

reserved bitrate to the new bitrate to be reserved (
D
p
dem
)
in any one of said nodes, a cell for validating the

reservation being transmitted from node to node of a
first node for which an actual increase in said current

reserved bitrate into said new bitrate is not
immediately possible at a last node in the connection

pathway in response to respective actual increases in
bitrate in these nodes.
