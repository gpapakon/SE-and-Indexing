<ABSTRACT>
A lens system for a folding reflex camera is provided. The system includes: (a) a first group on the object side of the system's stop which (i) has a positive dioptric power, (ii) includes an aspheric surface, and (iii) has a concave surface adjacent to the stop; and (b) a second group on the image side of the stop consisting of either a single positive component or the combination of a single positive component and one or more focusing elements. The system includes at least two elements made of materials differing in dispersive powers where at least one of the elements is of plastic. The system may comprise one or more aspheric surfaces. The system can comprise just two plastic elements and even with such a simple configuration achieves excellent optical performance including a relatively flat field, relatively low distortion and at least partial correction for lateral chromatic aberration.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to objective lens systems for use
in cameras and, in particular, to objective lens systems for use in
folding, reflex cameras.Numerous objective lens systems for cameras have been
proposed. Examples employing two elements include Simpson, Jr. et
al., U.S. Patents Nos. 4,932,764 and 5,000,552, and Davis, U.S.
Patent No. 2,586,418. See also Aldis, U.S. Patent No. 682,017,
discussed below. A two element lens for use in a copying machine,
as opposed to a camera, is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication
No. 3-242608. Similarly, Rothe, U.S. Patent No. 4,645,311,
discloses a two element design including an aspheric surface for use
in an optical scanner.Three element designs include Bertele, U.S. Patent No.
2,721,501, Grey, U.S. Patent No. 3,784,287, De Jager, U.S. Patent
No. 3,967,884, and Sato, U.S. Patent No. 4,542,961 in which an
aspheric surface is used, as well as the early Cooke/Taylor triplet and 
variations thereof. See Kingslake, R., A History of the Photographic
Lens, Academic Press, New York, 1989, pages 103-115.The incorporation of a focusing element or group in an
objective lens system is disclosed in the following patents:
Westphalen, U.S. Patents Nos. 3,185,061 and 3,388,650, Laurent,
U.S. Patent No. 4,174,153, Yamada, U.S. Patent No. 4,394,071,
Owen, Jr. et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,443,067, Wakabayashi, U.S.
Patent No. 4,669,848, Nishi et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,791,441,
Nakayama et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,830,474, Takase, U.S. Patent No.
4,913,537, and Ogawa et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,005,038. A
construction of this general type for use in a viewfinder is disclosed
in Wakamiya, U.S. Patent No. 4,832,470. A magnifying lens
employing an aspheric surface for attachment to the objective of a
camera is disclosed in Baker, U.S. Patent No. 3,604,786, and the use
of an auxiliary lens for short range work is disclosed in Noguchi, U.S.
Patent No. 4,505,566.Also of interest is U.S. Patent No. 697959, dated April
22, 1902 to Ernst Abbe. He discusses how an aspheric surface can
be used to improve far off-axis performance of a landscape type lens
(cemented doublet and stop).The features of the preamble of Claim 1 are in combination
known from CH 195 702 A. JP 225 3224 A discloses
a lens system for a copying device and describes
that the cost of a lens system can be reduced with a
light weight system by constituting one lens out of
a lens system consisting of three lenses of plastic.Notwithstanding the variety of objective lens systems
which have been previously proposed, there still
