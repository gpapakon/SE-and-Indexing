<ABSTRACT>
A material for replacing foamed materials is the face-to-face (spacer) textile material which consists of two woven or knitted top layers which are connected by a pile thread structure. This pile thread structure is responsible for the compressibility known from flexible foams and the large air content. The compliance can be determined through the length and density of the pile threads and the material used. If recyclable materials are used, they provide a way of obtaining an environmentally compatible foam replacement. In addition, the face-to-face textile material can, through the use of treated starting materials or through a treatment during or after making, be given chemical and physical properties and thus be used for example as a filter or catalyst material.

<CLAIMS>
Face-to-face fabric, produced on a knitting machine, having an upper and a lower
cover layer, (1, 2) consisting of knitted material, said cover layers being connected by

at least one pile thread structure (3), the cover layers (1, 2) and the pile thread
structure (3) consisting of knitted fabric or of material having knitted and woven

constituents, 
characterised in that
 the face-to-face fabric has a three-dimensional
shape, based on a variation of the pile thread length, pile thread density and/or of the

pile thread material and on an increase and decrease of stitches.
Face-to-face fabric according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the thickness of
the face-to-face fabric is varied by changing the pile thread length
Face-to-face fabric according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 at least one
textile intermediate layer (8) is present between the cover layers (1, 2) which

intermediate layer is joined to the cover layers and/or other intermediate layers via
pile thread structures (9, 10).
Face-to-face fabric according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in
that
 the cover layers (1, 2) have planar structures, in particular patterns, structure
variations and/or colour variations.
Face-to-face fabric according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 a
material of a pile thread is selected in such a manner that it reacts to chemical or

physical influences in a reversible, partially reversible or irreversible manner.
Face-to-face fabric according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 the
pile thread courses of at least one cover layer are realised varying regularly or

irregularly. 
Face-to-face fabric according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 at
least one cover layer and/or middle layer and/or pile thread structure consists of at

least two different materials.
Face-to-face fabric according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that

fillers, chemical reagents and/or materials which have a physical activity are layered
into the pile thread structure.
Method of manufacturing the face-to-face fabric according to one of claims 1 to 8,

characterised in that
 the thread material is sized before the manufacture of the
fabric and is desized again after the processing.
Method of manufacturing the face-to-face fabric according to one of claims 1 to
8, 
characterised in that
 the pile thread structure and/or at least one of the cover
layers is infiltrated with at least one liquid, gaseous, pourable or powder-form

substance, which modifies the surface of the material of the pile thread structure or of
the cover layer in its chemical and/or physical properties and/or remains in the face-to-face

fabric either in the original form or in a chemically altered form.
Method of manufacturing the face-to-face fabric according to claim 10,

characterised in that
 it is finished so as to be flame resistant, hygroscopic or water-repellent,
and/or resistant to chemicals.
Method of manufacturing the face-to-face fabric according to one of claims 1
to 8, 
characterised in that
, for at least one pole thread structure a first material and,
for at least on
e cover layer a second material is used, the first and second materials
differing in their reaction to a physical and/or chemical effect, and in that, after the

mechanical construction of the textile, this physical or chemical effect occurs,
whereby the geometry and/or structure of the fabric alters. 
Method of manufacturing the face-to-face fabric according to claim 12,

characterised in that
 the fabric is exposed to a raised temperature, at which the
second material substantially contracts.
Use of the face-to-face fabric according to one of claims 1 to 8 as a substitute
for foamed materials or products containing foamed materials, as well as for large-volume

bonded fabric articles.
Use of the face-to-face fabric according to one of claims 1 to 8 for technical
applications, medical applications or as a material for decorative purposes.
Use of the face-to-face fabric according to claim 14 or 15 for shock-absorbent
linings, filter, soundproofing, heat insulation, rear ventilation, insulation, coverings,

upholstery, elastic and inelastic collision energy absorbers, substance-absorbing,-releasing
or -exchanging articles or chemically active articles such as catalysts or ion

exchangers.
Use of the face-to-face fabric according to claim 15 for incontinence articles,
bandaging materials, shoe soles, insoles, protective clothing, especially with an

insulating effect or with the effect of intercepting mechanical effects, and/or for
paddings.
Use of the face-to-face fabric according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised
in that
 that it is used to balance, emphasise and/or pad surface contours.
Use of the face-to-face fabric according to one of claims 1 to 8 for the lining
of wheel cases.
