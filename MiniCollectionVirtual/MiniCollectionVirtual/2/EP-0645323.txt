<ABSTRACT>
A conveying apparatus (1) for the conveyance of bottles (10) has an entry-side connecting conveyor (3), a main conveyor (2) and an exit-side connecting conveyor (7). In order to guarantee a reliable transfer of the bottles (10), even of those with stability insufficient for belt conveyance, from the entry-side connecting conveyor (3) to the main conveyor (2) and from the main conveyor (2) to the exit-side conveyor (7), there are provided in the transfer regions auxiliary devices (6, 8, 13, 16, 18) which specifically define the spatial orientation of the bottles (10) and thereby ensure a reliable transfer of the bottles (10) from one conveyor to the other (3, 2; 2, 7). Provision is made, furthermore, for the auxiliary devices (6, 8, 13, 16, 18) to be displaceable between an operative position and a position of rest. As a result, both PET bottles with a stability insufficient for belt conveyance and glass bottles can be transported on such a conveying apparatus (1).

18) are arranged in the transfer regions (5, 9) from the 

inlet-side connection conveyor (3) to the main conveyor 
(2) and from the main conveyor (2) to the outlet-side 

connection conveyor (7), these auxiliary devices clearly

in that an auxiliary device designed as an additional 

conveyor (6) is arranged in the inlet-side transfer 
region (5), the conveyor (6) being equipped with carry-along 

elements (23) which grip the hollow bodies (10) 
laterally. 
Conveying system according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that additional means (13) which yield under the  

 
conveying pressure and are intended for restraining the 

hollow bodies (10) are arranged in the inlet-side transfer 
region (5). 
Conveying system according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the additional conveyor (6) is 

designed as a side belt conveyor whose carry-along 
elements (23) are profiled transversely with respect to 

the conveying direction (45). 
Conveying system according to one of Claims 2 to 
4, characterized in that the length of the additional 

conveyor (6) is a fraction of the overall length of the 
inlet-side connection conveyor (3). 
Conveying system according to one of Claims 3 to 
5, characterized in that the restraining means (13) 

provided are resilient clamps which are arranged in pairs 
above and beneath the path of the carry-along members 

(20) of the main conveyor (2), the resilient clamps (13) 
additionally guiding the hollow bodies (10) laterally. 
Conveying system according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that an auxiliary device (8) 

designed as a pneumatic conveyor is arranged in the 
outlet-side transfer region (9). 
Conveying system according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that additional means (16) which yield under the 

conveying pressure and are intended for restraining the 
hollow bodies (10) are arranged in the outlet-side 

transfer region (9). 
Conveying system according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that the restraining means (16) provided are 

resilient clamps which are arranged in pairs above and 
beneath the path of the carry-along members (20) of the 

main conveyor (2). 
Conveying system according to one of Claims 7 to 
9, characterized in that a plate (18) which determines 

the level of the hollow bodies is additionally provided 
in the outlet-side transfer region (9). 
Conveying system according to one of Claims 2 to 
10, characterized in that the speed of the additional 

conveyor (6) is lower than that of the main conveyor (2).  
 
Conveying system according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the connection conveyors 

(3, 7) each have a conveying belt and lateral 
guide railings (26, 27) for the hollow bodies (10), which 

are conveyed on the conveying belt (3, 7) in an upright 
position. 
Conveying system according to one of Claims 7 to
