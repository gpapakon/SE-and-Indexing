<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for sorting mail items, said sorting being carried out base on characteristics located on the face of the mail items and by a sorting machine which sorts said explored and recognised characteristics. In order to ensure continuous final sorting in a sorting machine whereof the number of separation racks is less than the number of final directions, the input mail items are pre-sorted according to a pre-sorting plan. Simultaneously, final sorting operations are executed on the machine, the pre-sorted mail items being re-inserted in the sorting machine to be subjected therein to a final sorting.

<CLAIMS>
Method of sorting items of mail on the basis of 
features on the surface of items of mail, using a 

sorting machine which sorts in accordance with 
these scanned and detected features, 
characterized 
in that
 incoming items of mail are presorted in 
accordance with a presorting plan, and at the same 

time on the sorting machine, final sorting 
processes, which at most are able to use the 

eliminations not made use of by the presorting, 
are carried out in accordance with respectively 

activated final sorting plans, the presorted items 
of mail assigned to the respectively activated 

final sorting plan being fed to the sorting 
machine again for final sorting, and the 

compartments in which the finally sorted items of 
mail are located being emptied completely before 

the start of each new final sorting plan. 
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
all the incoming items of mail are presorted, and 

the items of mail presorted for the active final 
sorting plans are fed to the sorting machine 

again. 
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
incoming items of mail which are to be sorted in 

accordance with respectively active final sorting  
 

plans are finally sorted immediately, without 
presorting. 
Method according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized 
in that
 the selection of the items of mail 
respectively subjected to final sorting, using the 

associated activated final sorting plans, is 
carried out in accordance with the arrival of 

items of mail or with operational points of view. 
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
separate input stations for items of mail are used 

for the items of mail which are not presorted and 
those which are presorted and fed to the machine 

again, the input station for items of mail which 
are not presorted having an address reader and a 

code printer, and the input station for the 
presorted items of mail having only a code reader. 
Method according to Claims 1-4, 
characterized in 
that
 the final sorting plans are automatically 
modified during operation on the basis of 

available statistical information.
