rhodium (Rh) having minimized magnetostriction and corrosion 

rates is provided. The alloy composition satisfies the 
equation:

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thin films used in magnetic
transducer heads and in particular to thin film ternary alloys of
nickel, iron and rhodium having virtually zero magnetostriction.Magnetoresistive (MR) transducers are used to read data
signals stored on magnetic media, such as magnetic disks. Soft
magnetic materials used in MR transducers vary in composition. A
preferred alloy consists of about 80% nickel (Ni) and about 20%
iron (Fe). Alloys having this approximate Ni/Fe composition are
commercially available under the trade name Permalloy. In order
to reduce corrosion of Permalloy-like materials, other components
have been incorporated into the Ni/Fe alloys. One additive which
is particularly advantageous in enhancing Ni/Fe alloy corrosion
resistance is rhodium (Rh).When rhodium is incorporated into an Ni/Fe alloy, the
magnetostriction of the alloy may be adversely affected.
Specifically, as rhodium is incorporated into Ni/Fe (Permalloy
type) alloys, the NiFe atomic ratio must be adjusted to maintain
the magnetostriction at near zero levels. The requirement for
near zero levels of magnetostriction arises from the fact that
stress, either substrate induced or intrinsic stress or a
combination thereof, in either the MR sensor and/or the soft
adjacent film used for transverse biasing of the active MR layer
can adversely affect the domain configuration of the sensor or
soft bias layer. Near zero magnetostriction in these layers
minimizes or eliminates these adverse effects and thus results in
a more reliable and reproducible sensor.In US-A-4,023,965, Ni-Fe-Rh-alloys are disclosed whereby this document is
concerned with corrosion resistance and not with magnetostriction.An object of this invention is to provide nickel-iron-rhodium 
compositions having substantially no magnetostriction.Another object of this invention is to improve the
corrosion resistance of nickel-iron alloys.According to the invention as claimed in claim 1, soft magnetic
alloys comprise NiFe having atomic ratios ranging from about 4.8
to 5.5. These alloys include an amount of rhodium that yield
near zero saturation magnetostriction, i.e., within +0.5 to -1.0 x 10-6 â–µl/l
as defined by the following equation:
Atomic % Rh = 11.63 (Ni/Fe) atomic ratio -49.53 atomic percentAccording to the invention, an MR read
transducer is formed with a soft magnetic layer including a
nickel/iron/rhodium alloy (claim 3). The composition of the soft magnetic
layer is defined by the above-defined equation. Preferably, the
soft magnetic material is
