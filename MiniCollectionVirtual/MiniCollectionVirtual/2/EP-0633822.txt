<ABSTRACT>
Foils are manufactured by creating a pattern (52) on a substrate (51) and then thickening (53) the patterned film. The foil may then be peeled away from the substrate (51) and/or pattern (52). The patterning step may include use of a laser or use of a photoresist, and may include deposition of a further layer. The thickening step may be performed by electrodeposition or electroless methods. The foils produced may be employed for dry shavers, sieves or filters.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of manufacturing
perforated foils, e.g. foils for dry shavers, filters,
sieves or the like, to a method of manufacturing dry
shavers, and to a method of manufacturing a sieve or
filter.US-A-4 857 698 describes a process for perforating a
sheet of titanium by impinging a pulsed Nd:YAG laser on one
surface of the sheet. To avoid recast structure or dross
around the holes, an adhesive backing tape of polyethylene is
secured on the other surface of the sheet before formation of
the holes.The closest prior art is a known process for manufacturing
foils for dry shavers which will now be described.
A first step of creating a pattern of holes is
carried out using a photo resist. In a preparatory
step, a steel plate is cleaned and dip-coated with
photo resist. The photo resist is then exposed
through a mask and developed to generate the foil
pattern. This photo resist pattern is then cured in
an oven.Next, the plate carrying the pattern is transferred
to a pre-nickel electroforming tank, for
electroforming with nickel to a thickness of
approximately 25 microns. Then the plate is
transferred to a passivation tank, and finally it is
transferred to a main electroforming tank in order to
electroform a main layer of nickel onto the foil to a
thickness of 60 microns. The nickel foil can then be
peeled away from the plate.This whole process has various disadvantages. It is
time consuming and involves many stages. It occupies 
a significant amount of workspace, and requires a
significant amount of time and effort in transferring
the plate from stage to stage. By its nature, the
process is discontinuous and only produces foils in
batches. Also, the photo resist process creates
troublesome effluents as by-products.Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention
to provide an improved method of manufacturing
perforated foils.According to one aspect of the invention, there is
provided a method of manufacturing a perforated foil
e.g. for a filter, a sieve, a dry shaver, or the
like, comprising the steps of: creating a pattern of holes in
an electrically conductive film supported on a substrate using
a laser to create the holes by removing material from the film
but not the substrate in a mainly photochemical ablative
process; and thickening the patterned film.According to another aspect of the invention, there
is provided a method of manufacturing a perforated
foil e.g. for a filter, a sieve, a dry shaver, or the
like, comprising the steps of: creating a pattern of holes in
