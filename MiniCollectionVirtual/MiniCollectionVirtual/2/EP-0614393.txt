 BOWLING ALLEY BUMPER SYSTEMFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a bowling alley bumper system and, more particularly, to a bowling alley bumper system wherein the gutter or portion thereof is elevated to prevent a bowling ball from falling into the gutter.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONBowling alley bumper systems have been available since at least as early as 1965. Such systems were designed to be used by children and/or the physically handicapped as well as others who lack the physical coordination or strength to bowl, i.e., project a majority of the balls over the length of the alley without ending up in one of the gutters. Early systems require relatively difficult steps to set up a lane or lanes for so-called "bumper" bowling. For this reason, a number of bowling alley operating personnel were reluctant to promote "bumper" bowling or to encourage children or the handicapped to use the lanes.One approach to overcome the aforementioned problem is disclosed in U.S. Patent Number 3,401,933 to Conklin et al. That patent discloses a convertible bowling lane having a gutter with a ball receiving surface on one side and a ball deflecting surface on the opposite side and means for moving the gutter between a ball receiving position and a ball deflecting position. As disclosed therein, the gutter is pivotally mounted on a support member which is disposed on the opposite side of the gutter from the bowling lane. The system does present the appearance of a normal bowling alley when in its recessed position, but is relatively complex and somewhat expensive to install.More recently, a bowling alley bumper mechanism such as the one disclosed in U.S. Patent Number 4,900,024, overcame many of the earlier problems. In such systems, an elongated bumper is mounted alongside and parallel to each alley gutter. The systems also include movable supports that permit the extension of the bumpers to guard the gutters when guarding is desired and retraction of the bumpers to expose the gutters when normal alley operation is desired. The Chandler et al. system is less cosdy and less complex than the 

Conklin et al. system, but extends upwardly above the level of the alley even in its recessed position. It also presents an obstacle to walking along the normal capping and may lead to individuals walking on the alley.An improvement to the Chandler et al. system is disclosed in the copending application of C. Dennis Lord, Serial Number 07/758,003, filed on September 12, 1991, and assigned to the same assignee as the

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A bumper bowling system comprising a series of cross supports and a bowling alley disposed on said series of cross supports, said bowling alley having two sides and a longitudinally extending lane having a major axis on an upper surface of said alley, said lane having a foul line at one end and a pin deck at the other end tiiereof, a pair of elongated concave gutters extending along and substantially abutting the sides of said lane between the ends thereof for receiving a bowling ball which falls off of said lane, each of said gutters having first and second separate longitudinally extending portions with each of said portions having a major axis parallel to the axis of said lane, each of said portions including means defining an arc-shaped segment with a first downwardly extending projection which extends downwardly with respect to said alley, a second downwardly extending portion which is parallel with said first downwardly extending projection, extending and retracting means for moving each of said portions of each of said gutters upwardly with respect to said alley into an extended position to thereby prevent a bowling ball from falling into one of said gutters and downwardly into a retracted position which allows bowling balls to roll into and along said one of said gutters and each of said extending and retracting means including a pair of swivel joints and an arm connecting said swivel joints and wherein a first of said swivel joints is operatively connected to said portion and die second of said swivel joints is operatively connected to one of said cross supports, said longitudinally extending portions lie on an x axis parallel with the major axis with a y axis laterally thereof and a z or vertical axis and characterized by said extending and retracting means moves each of said portions including said downwardly extending projections an equal distance upwardly and downwardly along an arc in the xz plane without any substantial lateral movement along the y axis.
2. A bumper bowling system comprising a series of cross supports and a bowling alley disposed on said series of cross supports, said bowling alley having two sides and a longitudinally extending lane having a major axis on an upper surface of said alley, said lane having a foul line at one end and a pin deck at the other end thereof, a pair of elongated concave gutters extending along and substantially abutting the sides of said lane between the ends thereof for receiving a bowling ball which falls off of said lane, each of said gutters having first and second separate longitudinally extending 


portions with each of said portions having a major axis parallel to the axis of said lane, each of said portions including means defining first and second laterally-spaced longitudinally extending arc-shaped segments including a downwardly extending projection which extends downwardly with respect to said alley adjacent to a side or
*
 said alley and a second downwardly extending projection which extends downwardly with respect to said alley and which is parallel with said first downwardly extending projection, extending and retracting means for moving said first arc-shaped segment of each of said portions of each of said gutters upwardly with respect-to said alley into an extended position to thereby prevent a bowling ball from falling into one of said gutters and downwardly into a retracted position which allows bowling balls to roll into and along said one of said gutters, said extending and retracting means including a pair of swivel joints and an arm connecting said swivel joints and wherein a first of said swivel joints is operatively connected to said first arc-shaped segments and the second of said swivel joints is operatively connected to one of said cross supports and each of said first arc-shaped segments lies on an x axis parallel with the major axis with a y axis laterally thereof and a z or vertical axis and characterized by said extending and retracting means moves each of said first arc-shaped segments upwardly and downwardly along an arc in the xz plane without any substantial lateral movement along the y axis.â€”
