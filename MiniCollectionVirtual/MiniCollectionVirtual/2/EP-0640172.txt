<ABSTRACT>
Separate wall members (20) bridge the space between adjacent blades (14) of a fan rotor (12) to define an inner wall of a flow annulus through the rotor (12). Each of the wall members (20) is adapted to be attached to the radially outer face (18) of a disc (16) and has opposing side faces (26) to which resilient seal strips (28) are bonded. The resilient seal strips (28) have flange portions (29) which are inclined radially inward along a curved edge (30) to produce undulations therein. The undulations enhance the flexibility of the flange portion (29) so that in operation as the fan rotor (12) rotates about a central axis of the engine (10) the flange portions (29) are deflected radially outwardly by centrifugal forces. The flange portions (29) are deflected into sealing contact with the adjacent fan blades (14) to seal the inner wall of the flow annulus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to air compressing 
rotors and in particular to a fan rotor for a gas turbine 
engine. A conventional fan rotor, as disclosed e.g. in the document EP-A-0 370 899, for compressing air 
comprises a disc having a plurality of radially extending 
blades mounted thereon. The fan blades are mounted on the 
disc by inserting the radially inner end of the blades in 
correspondingly shaped retention grooves in the radially 
outer face of the disc. The fan blades do not have 
platforms so the inner wall of an annulus for the 
compressed air is formed by fastening separate wall 
members to the radially outer face of the disc. The 
separate wall members bridge the space between pairs of 
adjacent blades to define the inner annulus wall. Each separate wall member has resilient strips bonded 
to the edges adjacent the fan blades. The resilient strips 
protrude so that they abut the adjacent fan blades. The 
resilient strips thus seal between the wall members and 
the fan blade to prevent air leaking past the inner wall 
of the flow annulus. A drawback of such an arrangement is that the 
resilient strips are a close fit with the adjacent blades 
which leads to difficulties in assembly. The present invention seeks to provide a rotor in 
which the inner wall of the flow annulus is defined by a 
plurality of wall members which are provided with 
resilient strips which allow for easier assembly. According to the present invention a rotor for a gas 
turbine engine comprises a rotor disc which has a radially 
outer face on which a plurality of radially extending 
blades are mounted, the blades being curved in an axially 
extending direction, separate wall members are provided to 
bridge the space between adjacent blades to define an 
inner wall of a flow annulus through the rotor, each of 
the wall members is adapted for attachment to the radially 
outer face of the disc and has opposing side faces which  
 
are spaced circumferentially from the adjacent blades and 
which are curved to follow the curvature of the adjacent 
blades, resilient seal strips being mounted adjacent the 
opposing side faces of the wall members, characterised in 
that each resilient seal strip has a flange portion which 
is inclined radially inward along a curved edge adjacent 
the opposing side face of the wall member, the edge having 
a curvature corresponding to the curvature of the opposing 
side face of the wall member and the angle of inclination 
of the flange portion varying along the edge to produce 
undulations

A rotor (12) for a gas turbine engine (10) comprising 
a rotor disc (16) which has a radially outer face (18) on 

which a plurality of radially extending blades (14) are 
mounted, the blades (14) being curved in an axially 

extending direction, separate wall members (20) being 
provided to bridge the space between adjacent blades (14) 

to define an inner wall of a flow annulus through the 
rotor, each of the wall members (20) being adapted for 

attachment to the radially outer face (18) of the disc 
(16) and having opposing side faces (26) which are spaced 

circumferentially from the adjacent blades (14) and which 
are curved to follow the curvature of the adjacent blades 

(14), resilient seal strips (28) being mounted adjacent 
the opposing side faces (26) of the wall members (20), 

characterised in that each resilient seal strip (28) has 
a flange portion (29) which is inclined radially inward 

along a curved edge (30) adjacent the opposing side face 
(26) of the wall member (20), the edge (30) having a 

curvature corresponding to the curvature of the opposing 
side face (26) of the wall member (20) and the angle of 

inclination of the flange portion (29) varying along the 
curved edge (30) to produce undulations in the flange 

portions (29) which enhance the flexibility of the flange 
portion, whereby in operation the flange portion (29) of 

the resilient seal strip (28) is deflected radially 
outwards by centrifugal forces as the rotor (12) rotates 

about a central axis of the engine (10) so that the flange 
portion (29) comes into contact with the adjacent fan 

blade (14) to seal the inner wall of the flow annulus.

undulations in the flange portion (29).

the resilient seal strips (28) are made from a woven 

material.  
 
A rotor as claimed in claim 3 characterised in that 
the resilient seal strips (28) are made from woven carbon 

fibres. 
A rotor as claimed in claim 3 characterised in that 
the resilient seal strips (28) are made from woven glass 

fibres. 
A rotor as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that a 
rubber strip is attached to the flange portion which 

contacts the adjacent fan blade when the flange portion is 
deflected radially outward under centrifugal forces.
