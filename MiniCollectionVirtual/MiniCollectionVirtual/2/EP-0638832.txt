<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal display apparatus is 
constituted by: a housing; a liquid crystal panel 

comprising a liquid crystal disposed between a pair of 
substrates each provided with electrodes, the liquid 

crystal panel being affixed to the housing; and a 
backlight for illuminating the liquid crystal panel, 

detachably affixed to the housing. A light-transmissive 
plate, such as a diffusion plate, 

allowing transmission of light from the backlight is 
further disposed between the liquid crystal panel and 

the backlight so as to define an almost closed first 
space in cooperation with the liquid crystal panel, 

whereby the first space retaina its almost closed 
state even when the backlight is detached from the 

housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
crystal display apparatus.Hitherto, various forms of liquid crystal
display apparatus have been proposed as disclosed in
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application (JP-A) 2-93425,
JP-A 3-203773 and JP-A 4-106529. Figure 1 shows an
example of such apparatus.Referring to Figure 1, the liquid crystal
display apparatus includes a liquid crystal panel 101
and a backlight device 100B, respectively housed in a
cover 110. The liquid crystal panel 101 comprises a
pair of glass substrates 101a and 101b sandwiching a
liquid crystal. The two glass substrates 101a and
101b are respectively provided with transparent
electrodes at their inner surfaces. Polarizers 107
and 108 are applied onto both sides of the liquid
crystal panel 101. To a side of the liquid crystal
panel 101, a flexible printed wire film ("TAB film")
103 loaded with a drive IC is connected, and a
peripheral circuit plate 102 of a drive IC for driving
the liquid crystal panel 101 is connected to the TAB
film 103. On the other hand, the backlight device
100B includes fluorescent lamps 104, a reflection
plate 105 and a diffusion plate 106 so that a light 
flux from a fluorescent lamps 104 is reflected by the
reflection plate 105, diffused by the diffusion plate
106 and then cast at a uniform luminance onto the
liquid crystal panel 101. The liquid crystal panel
101 is fixed onto the cover 10 composed of a plate
metal or a resin via a cushioning member 109
comprising, e.g., rubber.In the above-described type of liquid crystal
display apparatus, only the cushioning member 109 is
disposed between the liquid crystal panel 101 and the
cover 110, and a vibration or impact applied to the
cover 110 is transmitted to the liquid crystal panel
101 without substantial attenuation, so that the
liquid crystal panel 101 receiving a mechanical stress
is liable to cause a degradation in display quality.
The liquid crystal injected into the liquid crystal
panel 101 may be a nematic liquid crystal or a
ferroelectric liquid crystal, of which the
ferroelectric liquid crystal is weaker against a
mechanical stress compared with the nematic liquid
crystal. Accordingly, the above difficulty is
particularly pronounced in the liquid crystal display
apparatus using a ferroelectric liquid crystal.In order to solve the above problem, a liquid
crystal display apparatus as shown in Figure 2 has
been proposed.In the liquid crystal display apparatus shown 
in Figure 2, cushioning members (an adhesive 113 and a
resin 115 described hereinafter) for
