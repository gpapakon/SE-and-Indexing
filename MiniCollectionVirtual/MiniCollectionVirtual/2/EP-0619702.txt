<ABSTRACT>
A construction for automatically milking animals, such as cows, comprises a milking box (14) with a milking robot (41) and an area (1, 28) where the animals can freely move about. The construction further includes a system of doors, gates or suchlike means (8 -12) which open in one direction to define the path and the direction of walking of the animals to the milking box (14). The milking box (14) includes two adjacently arranged milking box compartments (15, 16). In this situation, the milking robot (41) is set-up in such a manner that the head (67) of the robot (41) can enter a first compartment from one side and a second compartment from another side.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a construction for
automatically milking animals, such as cows, comprising a
milking box with a milking robot and at least two enclosed
areas where the animals can freely move about, which
construction includes a system of doors, gates or suchlike
means which open in one direction for defining the path and
the direction in which the animals can walk to and from the
milking box, and in that the areas are connected successively
to each other while the milking box is arranged between two
successive areas, and the system of doors, gates or suchlike
means are arranged in such a way that an animal can walk from
a first area of the successive areas to a second area of the
successive areas via the milking box.A construction of the above defined type is known
from EP-A-0 432 148.In this construction two groups of cows are
accommodated in a shed, which is divided in two areas. The
shed furthermore comprises a milking box with a milking
robot, which the animals of both groups can enter via a
system of doors. Once the animals are milked, they can leave
the milking box and return to the area in which they were
accommodated. The above mentioned construction has the
disadvantage that, due to the fact that the animals return in
their area, they can easily return to the entrance door of
the milking box, which is in direct contact with said area.
The latter means that they block the entrance door for the
animals to be milked.EP-A-0 582 350, which is an Article 54(3) document
except for Ireland, relates to a construction in which the
animals can go from one enclosed area to another enclosed
area via the milking box in one direction only. Since the
animals can only go one way, it is not possible for animals
to return to the milking box if they feel the need to be 
milked again.The invention has for its object to provide a
construction of the above defined type in which the animals,
after being milked, cannot easily return to the milking robot
entrance, but still have the opportunity of visiting the
milking robot.According to the invention this is achieved in that
the animal can walk from said second area via at least one
other successively connected enclosed area, to said first
area. In this way the animal that has been previously milked
cannot directly return to the milking robot since it has to
pass at least one other successively connected area to return
to said first area. Dual doors, gates or suchlike means in
accordance with the invention comprise 
means via which animals can go from

<CLAIMS>
A construction for automatically milking animals,
such as cows, comprising a milking box (14) with a milking

robot (41) and at least two enclosed areas where the animals
can freely move about, which construction includes a system

of doors, gates or suchlike means (8 - 12) which open in one
direction for defining the path and the direction in which

the animals can walk to and from the milking box (14), and in
that the areas are connected successively to each other while

the milking box (14) is arranged between two successive
areas, and the system of doors, gates or suchlike means (8 -

12) are arranged in such a way that an animal can walk from a
first area of the successive areas to a second area of the

successive areas via the milking box (14), characterized in
that the animal can walk from said second area, via at least

one other successively connected enclosed area, to said first
area.
A construction as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that an area (1, 28) comprises a pasture and a shed with

cubicles for the animals, the shed furthermore being arranged
such that the animals can optionally stay in a pasture

adjacent to the shed or in the cubicles.
A construction as claimed in claim 2, characterized
in that the animals can pass through the shed (1) and the

pasture (28) in one direction only.
A construction as claimed in claim 2 or 3,
characterized in that the shed (1), and optionally the

pasture (28), is provided with dual doors or gates (8 - 12)
which open in one and the same direction. 
A construction as claimed in any one of claims 1,
2 or 4, characterized in that the doors or gates (8 - 12)

include a counting device.
A construction as claimed in claim 5, characterized
in that a computer is present which determines the

number of animals in an area between two doors or gates (8 -
12) which are arranged consecutively in the path and open in 

one and the same direction, with the aid of which computer a
higher or lower number of animals is allowed to enter such an

area by closing a door or gate or by leaving same open.
A construction as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims 2-6, characterized in that, by
 means of the system of
doors or gates (8 - 12) which open in only one direction, the

animals pass through the shed (1) and optionally the pasture
(28) in one and the same direction three times a day.
A construction as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims 2-6, characterized in that a radio system (25) with

aerial and loudspeaker is attached to an animal, which
operates in such a manner that, if there are too many animals

in a location, animals are encouraged by sounds from the
loudspeaker to move in one direction through the shed (1) and

optionally a pasture (28) contiguous thereto to the milking
robot (41).
A construction as claimed in claim 9 or 10, characterized
in that the radio system (25) is part of a collar

(26) of the animal.
