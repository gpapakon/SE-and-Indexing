<ABSTRACT>
A treatment method for polyene resins used in thiol-ene formulations, especially norbornene resins, significantly stabilizes thiol-ene compositions made from batches of polyene resin which otherwise give compositions with poor dark stability. The treatment comprises contacting the polyene with an amphoteric treating agent selected from the group consisting of silicated magnesium oxide, basic aluminum oxide, silica gel, magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, barium oxide, and barium hydroxide, and then separating the resin from the treating agent prior to mixture with a polythiol to form a thiol-ene composition. The treatment method significantly reduces ionic content in polyene resins, particularly chloride ion but also sodium and potassium ions. Consequently, treatment is also beneficial with polyene resins which do not produce substantial dark stability problems. Reduction of the ionic content of the resin is desirable to produce cured thiol-ene polymers with low electrical conductivity and low corrosiveness.

<DESCRIPTION>
As used herein:A polyene is a compound having a plurality of olefinically
unsaturated groups.A polythiol is a compound having plurality of organic thiol
groups.A thiol-ene composition is a mixture of a polyene and a
polythiol formulated to cure at least predominately by addition of thiol groups across
the olefinic double bond of the polyene. Generally the composition will include a
free radical initiator such as a peroxy compound or a free radical photoinitiator to
initiate the thiol-ene addition reactions.Norbornenyl groups, as used herein, are broadly defined to
encompass organic functional groups of the formula:

where Q is CR21, O, S, NR1 or SO2, R1 is H or alkyl; and m is 0-10. Thus the term
should be understood to encompass, in addition to true norbornenyl groups, various
substituted analogs, nadic groups and various other cyclopentadiene Diels-Alder
polyadducts.In thiol-olefin cooxidation reactions it has been reported that chloride
ion and bromide ion shortened an initial slow oxygen-absorbing phase while iodide
ion prolonged the initial phase and decreased its rate. Bredereck et al, Chemische
Berichte,93 2415-2423 (1960); D'Souza et al, J. Org. Chem. 1987, 41, 1729-1740.
Several hypotheses are offered in the latter reference as possible explanations of the 
difference between chloride/bromide and iodide in this reaction, but no conclusions
are drawn as to which of the hypotheses are correct.Organohalo compounds, such as tris(2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate
and tetrabromophthalic anhydride (0.1-10%) in combination with mercaptans
(0.05-5%) are said to improve melt spin properties of polyolefin compounds.
Chem. Abst.,80:1222322 (abstracting JP 48004374).The polymerization of methacrylate ester monomers during
neutralization, washing and/or extraction with base is reported to be inhibited by
adding 0.03-0,3 % NaNO2 and/or KI to the solutions. Chem. Abst.,106; 156990r
(abstracting CS 229529).Heat stability of nylon to polymer containing a copper stearate , KI,
and 2-mercaptobenzimidazole is reported to be improved over comparable
formulations omitting either the KI or the mercapto compound in Chem. Abst.,81:
137494f (abstracting JP 49053944).CA 985848 describes a treatment method for removing catalyst
residues form olefin polymer solutions by contacting the
solution with alumina or activated bauxite, optionally
treated with an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, or
with a solid alkaline material such as "magnesol" magnesium silicate.Halogen containing compounds such as
