<ABSTRACT>
- Making hot drinks. - The invention relates to a centrifugal extraction cell for a hot drinks machine, comprising a drum (1) in which the ground material is collected and to which there is sealed, by a sealing means, a lid (2) having an orifice (12) through which liquid is introduced, and a filter means. - The invention employs a filter means and a sealing means that consist of at least one deformable seal (25), said seal (25) having properties of deformation and being fitted in such a way that while the operating pressure inside the cell is below a predetermined level, the cell is sealed, whereas above this pressure the ground material mixed with the liquid is filtered, owing to deformation of the seal. - Espresso coffee machine.

<CLAIMS>
A centrifugal-type extractor unit for a hot-drink machine, the
extractor unit including filtering means, a drum (1) for collecting

grounds, and a cover (2) provided with a liquid inlet orifice (12)
and mounted in sealed manner on the drum via sealing means, the

filtering means and the sealing means being constituted by at least
one deformable gasket (25), said gasket (25) having deformation

properties and being mounted so that, below a pre-established
operating pressure in the unit, it seals said unit, and so that,

above said pressure, it deforms and thereby filters the grounds-and-liquid
mixture, said extractor unit being characterized in that the

deformable gasket (25) is interposed in a groove (15) between the
drum (1) and the cover (2).
An extractor unit according to claim 1, characterized in that the
gasket (25) is mounted so that it is compressed in a pre-established

compression range by compression control means (50).
An extractor unit according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the compression control means (50) are formed by a mechanical

abutment element (53) interposed between the drum (1) and the cover
(2).
An extractor unit according to claim 3, characterized in that it
includes at least one pressure relief channel (61) provided

internally between the gasket (25) and the groove (15).
An extractor unit according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the groove (15) is provided with perforations

(55) extending between its top wall (15a) and the outside of the
unit.
An extractor unit according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that
each pressure relief channel (61) inwardly extends the inside end of

the associated perforation (55) and opens out into the groove (15). 
An extractor unit according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the groove (15) in which the gasket (25) is

disposed in provided in the cover (2) or in the drum (1), and has a
top wall (15a) extending substantially radially relative to the axis

of symmetry x-x' of the unit.
An extractor unit according to claim 7, characterized in that the
groove (15) is provided in the peripheral edge of the cover (2), and

in that the gasket (25) is held in place against the top wall (15a)
by compression means (10) integral with the drum (1).
An extractor unit according to claim 8, characterized in that the
compression means form a rib (10) on the periphery of the drum (1),

the rib defining a top face (10a) for abutting in sealed manner
against the gasket (25), and two side faces (10b, 10c), each of which

co-operates with the wall of the groove (15) that is associated with

it to form a flow zone (20, 21) respectively to enable the grounds-and-water
mixture to flow in and to enable the drink to flow out

after it has been filtered between the gasket (25) and the top
face (10a).
An extractor unit according to any one of claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that, in its sealing position, the gasket (25)

occupies up to 120% of the corresponding sectional area "s" of the
groove (15), and preferably in the range 110% and 120%.
An extractor unit according to any preceding claim, characterized
in that the gasket (25) is made of a material that preferably

contains silicone or is NBR, and that has Shore A hardness lying in
the range 50 to 90, and preferably in the range 65 to 75.
An extractor unit according to any preceding claim, characterized
in that both the gasket (25) and the groove (15) extend over the

entire circumference of the unit to form an annular gasket, and a
peripheral groove. 
An extractor unit according to any preceding claim, characterized
in that the gasket (25) has a cross-section that is substantially

circular, or else that is square or rectangular.
A hot-drink machine provided with an extractor unit according to
any one of claims 1 to 13.
A machine according to claim 14, characterized in that it is
constituted by a centrifugal coffee machine.
