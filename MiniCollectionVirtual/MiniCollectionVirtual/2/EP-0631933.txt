<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for picking up items (P) from a containment 
volume (V) and for selectively feeding them to a loading 

station (C1, C2), which includes: 

a rotatable body (2) interposed, in use, between 
the containment volume (V) and the loading station 

(C1, C2), with a peripheral portion of the rotatable 
body (2) extending into the containment volume (V), 
at least one aperture (12) round the periphery of 
the rotatable body (2) whereby rotation of the 

rotatable body (2) causes the at least one aperture 
(12) to travel a path which passes, at least in 

part, through the containment volume (V), 
pump means (6 to 10) terminating at the at least 
one aperture (12) and provided to establish an air-pressure 

gradient through at least one aperture (12) 
to draw the items (P) onto the surface of the 

rotatable body (2), whereby rotation of the 
rotatable body (2) causes the items (P) to be 

entrained from the containment volume (V), 
transfer means (14) acting between the surface of 
the rotatable body (2) and the loading station (C1, 

C2) selectively to transfer towards this loading  
 

station (C1, C2) the items (P) picked up from the 
containment volume (V) and held on the surface of 

the rotatable body (2) by the pressure gradient.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for picking 
up items, preferably automatically, from a containment 
volume according to the pre-characterising portions of Claims 1 and 
14, which are known, e.g. from US-A-4 697 721 or US-A-3 285 387.  
 
The invention was developed with particular attention to 
its possible use in the automatic packaging of containers 
for small toys intended to be inserted as surprises into 
food products or the like. In this field of application, an arrangement has been 
known for many years whereby the surprises are put into 
a container commonly known as a "little barrel", made up 
of two cup-like bodies which can be fitted together by 
engagement of their open ends. Very often, the surprise is of a type requiring assembly 
and a sheet of assembly instructions and/or transfers for 
applying to the surprise must be put into the container 
as well as the component parts: usually this sheet or 
sheets are rolled into a tube for insertion in one of the 
cup-like bodies, in contact with its inner surface. In view of the high production rate of the products in 
which the container must be inserted (especially in the 
case of confectionery manufactured on an industrial  
 
scale), and considering the need to keep the cost of the 
surprise as low as possible, it is definitely desirable 
to be able to fill and assemble the container 
automatically, especially as far as the following 
operations are concerned: 
picking up the component parts of the surprise 
in order to put them into the container, inserting the parts into the container (usually 
into one of its cup-like constituents), 
together with the sheet or sheets carrying the 
assembly instructions and/or decorative 
transfers, and assembling the container by coupling of its two 
constituent cup-like bodies. Until now, it has been practically impossible to carry 
out the operations described above entirely 
automatically. In order to ensure that the finished 
product was reliable (especially to ensure that the 
container contains all parts of the surprise, that the 
sheet or sheets are inserted and that the container is 
securely closed), manufacturers were therefore obliged to 
resort to manual packaging which involved considerable 
problems of organization, cost and, above all, hygiene of 
the finished product. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
solution to the first of the above problems in particular  
 
(picking up the component parts of the surprise), the 
other problems being solved
