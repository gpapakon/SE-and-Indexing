<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ethylene/propylene copolymer 
rubbers (EPRs), which include ethylene/propylene copolymers (EPMs) 
and ethylene/propylene/ethylidene norbornene terpolymers (EPDMs), 
generally having a crystalline content of less than about 15 percent by 
weight, and a process for their production. The EPRs are elastomeric copolymers and terpolymers used 
in such applications as hose and tubing, wire and cable, gaskets, and 
single ply roofing. They are usually formulated with fillers, oils, 
processing aids, and stabilizing agents, and cured by reacting the 
polymers with sulfur in the presence of accelerators or with a 
combination of sulfur and an organic peroxide such as dicumyl 
peroxide. These polymers are presently manufactured commercially in 
solution and slurry processes with soluble vanadium catalysts. The 
processes are very expensive to run, requiring solvent removal and 
steam stripping steps. In addition, these solution catalysts do not 
provide satisfactory particle morphology in a fluidized bed. 
Improvement in these processes would be desirable and, particularly, 
the development of a gas phase process to produce these same 
products would be more economically attractive because little post-reaction 
cost will be incurred. One of the catalysts selected to produce the EPRs in the gas 
phase is described in United States patent 4,508,842. This catalyst is 
one of several conventional catalysts useful for the production of 
polyethylene, and it would be commercially advantageous to have a 
catalyst, which, not only can be utilized in the production of 
polyethylenes having good properties, but can also be used 
successfully for the production of EPR's.  
 Typically, the catalyst described in the above-mentioned 
United States patent, is comprised of a catalyst precursor, which is 
the reaction product of vanadium trichloride and an electron donor, 
the precursor being reacted with an aluminum containing modifier, 
and impregnated into a silica support; a promoter such as chloroform; 
and a triisobutylaluminum cocatalyst. This catalyst does achieve 
good particle morphology, but poor overall product, e.g., EPRs made 
with this catalyst exhibit poor cure and contain much high 
temperature crystallinity. This is believed to be the result of poorly 
distributed propylene, and, in the case of the EPDMs, poorly 
distributed diene. Adjustments with respect to the cocatalyst and the 
promoter were found to improve the propylene distribution and lower 
the high temperature crystallinity,
