<ABSTRACT>
In a passive optical telecommunications system, an electric carrier signal is DPSK-modulated in the upstream transmission, whereafter the electric signal modulated in this way effects the intensity modulation of the transmitted light; in the downstream signal transmission, the transmitted light is intensity-modulated by a preferably scrambled NRZ baseband signal. The carrier signal is derived from the regenerated receive clock signal of the local device by frequency multiplexing.

Passive optical telecommunication system, in 
which in each case a plurality of decentralized telecommunication 

devices (DU), preferably subscriber locations 
or Distant Units 

joining subscriber locations, is in each case connected 
via a dedicated optical waveguide subscriber line (OAL) 

to an optical brancher (V) which is connected directly or 
via at least one further optical brancher (V) to a common 

optical waveguide connection of a central telecommunication
