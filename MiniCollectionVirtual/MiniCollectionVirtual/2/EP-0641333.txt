<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation in part 
of Patent Application Serial No. 07/886,558, filed 
May 20, 1992, which is a continuation in part of 
PCT/US91/8613, filed November 18, 1991, which is a 
continuation in part of 07/789,646, filed November 14, 
1991, which is a continuation in part of U.S. Patent 
Application Serial No. 07/615,210, filed November 19, 
1990. Synthesis of many HIV protease inhibitors 
containing a hydroxyethylamine or hydroxyethylurea 
isostere include the amine opening of a key 
intermediate chiral epoxide. The synthesis of the key 
chiral epoxide requires a multi-step synthesis 
starting from L-phenylalanine and results in a low 
overall yield. The diastereoselectivity of the 
reduction step of the intermediate amino 
chloromethylketone is low and use of explosive 
diazomethane prevents the scale up of the method to 
multikilogram productions. The present invention 
relates to a method of preparing retroviral protease 
inhibitors and more particularly to a 
diastereoselective method of forming chiral 
intermediates for the preparation of urea containing 
hydroxyethylamine protease inhibitors.  
 Roberts et al, Science,248, 358 (1990), 
Krohn et al, J. Med. Chem.344, 3340 (1991) and 
Getman, et al, J. Med. Chem., 346, 288 (1993) have 
previously reported synthesis of protease inhibitors 
containing the hydroxyethylamine or hydroxyethylurea 
isostere which include the opening of an epoxide 
generated in a multi-step synthesis starting from an 
amino acid. These methods also contain steps which 
include diazomethane and the reduction of an amino 
chloromethyl ketone intermediate to an amino alcohol 
prior to formation of the epoxide. The overall yield 
of these syntheses are low and the use of explosive 
diazomethane additionally prevents such methods from 
being commercially acceptable. Tinker et al U.S. Patent No. 4,268,688 
discloses a catalytic process for the asymmetric 
hydroformylation to prepare optically active aldehydes 
from unsaturated olefins. Similarly, Reetz et al U.S. 
Patent No. 4,990,669 discloses the formation of 
optically active alpha amino aldehydes through the 
reduction of alpha amino carboxylic acids or their 
esters with lithium aluminum hydride followed by 
oxidation of the resulting protected beta amino 
alcohol by dimethyl sulfoxide/oxalyl chloride or 
chromium trioxide/pyridine. Alternatively, protected 
alpha amino carboxylic acids or esters thereof can be 
reduced with diisobutylaluminum hydride to form the 
protected amino aldehydes. Reetz et al
