<ABSTRACT>
Accurately aligning opto-electronic image sensors with respect to a beam-splitter 
being comprised in an image sensing device is facilitated by incorporating an 

alignment pattern in the conductive metal stripes of the opto-electronic image sensors. 
When simultaneously viewed through the input face of the beam-splitter, alignment 

patterns of respective opto-electronic image sensors form a combined alignment patterns 
showing the accuracy of the alignment of the opto-electronic image sensors. By 

providing differences between pitches of the alignment patterns on either side of an axis 
of reflection, a combined alignment pattern is obtained showing various types of 

alignment errors, such as horizontal or vertical translation, or rotations. Quantification 
of alignment errors is facilitated by making use of vernier action in the combined 

alignment pattern.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to an image sensing device comprising beam-splitting 
means for splitting an image carrying radiation beam into a plurality of sub-image 
carrying radiation beams, and comprising, for recording each of the sub-images, 
a plurality of opto-electronic image sensors each having a circuit lay-out. The invention 
also relates to an x-ray examination apparatus comprising such an image sensing device. An image sensing device of said kind is known from the German 
OffenlegungsschriftDE 39 15 882. In the cited reference an x-ray examination apparatus is described 
comprising an image sensing device having two opto-electronic image sensors and a 
beam-splitting prism. An image carrying light beam is split into a transmitted light 
beam and a reflected light beam. By a first and a second opto-electronic image sensor 
the transmitted and reflected light beams, respectively, are detected. The opto-electronic 
image sensors are arranged in a shifted manner, such that picture elements (pixels) 
registered by the first opto-electronic image sensor fall within interstices of picture 
elements registered by the second opto-electronic image sensor and vice versa. By the 
opto-electronic image sensors sub-images are converted into video signals of sub-images. 
By a recombination circuit said electronic sub-images are recombined into a 
video signal of a recombined image having an improved spatial resolution as compared 
to any of the sub-images. A problem of the known image sensing device is that it is difficult and 
elaborate to accomplish the required accurate alignment of the opto-electronic image 
sensors. It is inter alia an object of the invention to provide an image sensing  
 
device having a plurality of opto-electronic image sensors comprising means for 
accurately aligning said opto-electronic sensors with respect to one another. It is also an 
object of the invention to provide an image sensing device having a plurality of opto-electronic 
sensors comprising means for quantifying alignment of said senors mounted 
in the image sensing device. This object is achieved in that an image sensing device according to the 
invention is characterized in that each opto-electronic image sensor is provided with an 
alignment pattern formed by at least part of its circuit lay-out. The spatial resolution and image-quality of the recombined image produced by 
an image sensing device in according to the invention by assembly from primary sub-images 
from respective opto-electronic image sensors is
