<ABSTRACT>
A process for treating an article by spraying at least one of its surfaces with an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide stabilised exclusively with an organic phosphonic acid. An aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide of high purity, the dry residue of which is less than 120 mg/kg and the conductivity of which is less than 120  mu S/cm, this aqueous solution being stabilised exclusively with an organic phosphonic acid.
