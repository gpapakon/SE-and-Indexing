<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transformer integrable with a semiconductor 
integrated circuit as claimed in the preamble of claim 1.  
 Multiple spiral windings that are inductively 
coupled to each other can be employed as transformers. 
An example of another prior art transformer employing 
two spiral windings disposed on the same surface 
is shown in plan view in Figure 1. There, an electrically 
conducting spiral 2 is disposed within an 
electrically conducting spiral 12. Both the external 
end 3 and the internal end 4 of spiral 2 require 
air bridge structures 9, insulating them from and 
crossing over windings of spiral 12 and giving electrical 
access to the spiral 2. Because spiral 12 
lies outside spiral 2, direct access to external end 
13 of spiral 12 is available. However, an air 
bridge structure 9 must still be provided tc give 
external access to the internal end 14 of spiral 12.  
 
Because of the presence of the three air bridges 9, 
the transformer of Figure 1 suffers from 
parasitic capacitance problems. 
In 
addition, the magnetic coupling between spirals 2 
and 12 is limited because only a relatively low 
permeability material, i.e., the substrate 1, is 
present in the vicinity of those windings. Another prior art transformer structure is 
shown in an exploded view in Figure 2. That transformer 
structure includes an electrically insulating 
substrate 1 on which insulating films 20, 30, and 40 
are successively disposed. Electrically conducting 
spirals 2 and 12 are respectively disposed on films 
20 and 40. Each of the films includes a through 
hole through the respective insulating films through 
which conductors 26 and 27 respectively extend to an 
underlaying layer, film 30 in the case of spiral 2 
and substrate 1 in the case of spiral 12. These 
electrical conductors passing through the insulating 
films provide an electrical connection to respective 
leads 6 from the internal ends 4 and 14 of spirals 2 
and 12. The two spirals 2 and 12 have the same 
sense, i.e., the same direction winding, and overlie 
each other to maximize their mutual inductive coupling. 
The mutual inductances of the two spirals is 
controlled by their geometries with respect to each 
other and the thicknesses of the insulating films. 
However, the mutual inductance between the two spirals 
is limited since the permeability of the adjacent 
materials is relatively small.  
 In Figures 3(a)-3(c), another prior art 
transformer structure for use in semiconductor integrated 
circuits is shown in
