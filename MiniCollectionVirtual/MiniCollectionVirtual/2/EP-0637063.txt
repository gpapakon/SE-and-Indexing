<ABSTRACT>
A method of in-situ cleaning a native oxide layer from the surface 
of a silicon wafer (40) positioned in a vacuum chamber (14) that is 

substantially free of oxidizing species by passing at least one 
non-oxidizing gas over the native oxide layer at a wafer cleaning 

temperature between about 650°C to about 1025°C for a sufficient length 
of time u
ntil such native oxide layer is removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a novel method of
cleaning native oxide from a silicon wafer surface and more
particularly, relates to a novel method of in-situ cleaning a native
oxide layer from the surface of a silicon wafer by heat in the presence
of at least one reducing gas.In the fabrication of semiconductor devices on silicon
wafers, various structures such as metalization layers, passivation
layers, insulation layers, etc. are formed on a silicon substrate. The
quality of the semiconductor device fabricated is a strong function of
the processes with which these structures are formed. The quality is
also a function of the cleanliness of the manufacturing environment in
which the silicon wafer is processed.Technological advances in recent years in the increasing
miniaturization of semiconductor circuits require more stringent control
of impurities and contaminants in the processing chamber of the
semiconductor device. When the miniaturization of the device progressed
to the submicron level, the minutest amount of contaminants can
significantly reduce the yield of wafers. Among the electronic materials frequently used for
deposition on silicon wafers, silicon nitride has gained more importance
in recent years. Silicon nitride is used extensively as a final
protective passivation and coating layer for semiconductor wafers
because of its excellent diffusion barrier characteristics against
moisture and alkali ions. Silicon nitride is a desirable semiconductor
material also for its high density and high dielectric properties.The deposition of silicon nitride is usually performed by a
low pressure chemical vapor deposition (hereinafter LPCVD) process in
which silicon tetrachloride or dichlorosilane and ammonia are reacted
together in a heated chamber. The reaction between silicon
tetrachloride or dichlorosilane and ammonia normally takes place with
nitrogen carrier gas at approximately 650°C or with hydrogen carrier gas
at approximately 1,000°C.In a LPCVD process for the deposition of silicon nitride,
the LPCVD chamber is first evacuated, a mixture of gases of
dichlorosilane and ammonia is then introduced into the
chamber which contains one or more silicon wafers each having a surface
onto which a silicon nitride layer is to be deposited. The silicon
wafers are generally heated to a deposition temperature at the time when
the mixture of gases are fed into the chamber such that the gases
decompose and thereby depositing a silicon nitride layer on the surface
of the wafer. For instance, in a
