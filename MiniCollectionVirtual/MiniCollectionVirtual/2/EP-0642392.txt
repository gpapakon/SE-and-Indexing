<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a vibratory screening apparatus (10, 10a) comprising a frame having a pair of opposed screen frame sides (11, 11a), a screen deck (13, 13a) mounted on the frame sides (11), and a shaft-driven vibratory mechanism coupled with the screen deck (13) to impart vibration energy thereto to assist the screening operation, the mechanism comprising: a pair of stubshafts (14) or projecting shaft ends (14b) associated one with each of the frame sides (11); a respective pair of bearing housings (15, 16; 15a, 16a) supporting each stubshaft (14) or shaft end (14b) and mounted on the respective frame sides (11, 11a) and spaced apart from each other; a respective counterweight (17, 17a) mounted on each stubshaft (14) or shaft end (14b) in the space between the housings (15, 16; 15a, 16a) of each pair, with the counterweight being rotatable with the stubshaft (14) or shaft end (14b) in order to apply vibration energy to the stubshaft and therefrom to the screen deck (13) via the bearing housings (15, 16; 15a, 16a) and the frame sides (11); and drive means (20, 20a) arranged to drive the vibratory mechanism. In one embodiment a drive motor (20) is coupled with each stubshaft (14) and arranged to apply synchronous drive to each stubshaft. In a second embodiment, a single shaft (14a) extends between the frame side (11a) and a single drive motor (20a) is coupled with one shaft end (14b). In both embodiments, the spaced bearing housings (15, 16; 15a, 16a) supporting each shaft end (14, 14b) with the counterweight (17, 17a) in the space between the housings provide vibrational energy to operate the screen but in a way which reduces the tendency of the drive shaft to oscillate excessively.

<DESCRIPTION>
 VIBRATORY SCREENING APPARATUSThis invention relates to a vibratory screening apparatus comprising a frame, at least one screen mounted on the frame, and a shaft-driven vibrating mechanism coupled with the screen in order to impart vibration thereto so as to assist the screening action.The invention has been developed primarily in connection with a screening apparatus for use in separating crushed stone, aggregate and the like into portions of different sizes, and seeks to provide an improved design of vibrating mechanism to apply vibration energy to the screen.It should be understood that a single screen e.g. a mesh screen comprises a minimum provision of screening in an apparatus according to the invention, though preferred embodiments will usually have more than one screen mesh or "deck", and may also have sets of vibratory grid bars.In one known design of vibratory screening apparatus, a shaft-driven vibrating mechanism comprises a single shaft which extends horizontally through the screen frame between opposed frame sides in the space between two screen decks, and in which each end region of the shaft is mounted on the respective screen side via a bearing housing which is secured to the frame side, and a counterweight is mounted on each free end of the shaft which projects outwardly of the respective bearing housing.Each counterweight comprises an off-set mass, and rotation of the shaft results in application of centrifugal force to the shaft via the counterweights which imparts required vibration energy to the screens of the apparatus.In this known apparatus, substantial bending moments are applied to the shaft by the counterweights, both by reason of the counterweights being mounted on the outwardly projecting ends of the shafts, and also because of the considerable overall length of the shaft which is required to extend throughout the width of the apparatus between the opposed screen frame sides. This causes the mid-region of 

the shaft to undergo substantial deflection which is undesirable, in that the shaft diameter will have to be of a sufficient size to withstand this applied bending load, and also there will be feedback to the mountings of the bearing housings on the frame sides which will also have to be suitably robust to bear these loads.The invention therefore seeks to provide a design of shaft-driven vibratory mechanism which is an improvement over this known apparatus, while still providing an efficient transfer of vibration energy to the screening elements of the apparatus.According
