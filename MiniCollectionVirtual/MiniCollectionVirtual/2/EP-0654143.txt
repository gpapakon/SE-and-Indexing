<ABSTRACT>
In a method for determining the kind and distribution of tissue in living organisms (1), especially the food content in e.g. crabs, the organism (1) is situated between a light source (2) for visible and infrared light, and a camera (3) connected to a computer (4). The organism (1) is candled by the visible and infrared light, the camera (3) is registrating this candeling, and the result is analysed by the computer (4). The camera (3) shoots a plane image of the object in one or more wavelength ranges, and data derived from the image or the images is analysed, by, in particular, comparing data descriptive of regions of the registered images, to corresponding data from images of corresponding objects of known quality. Based upon this analysis, the objects are sorted into predetermined quality classes.

<DESCRIPTION>
Method for determining the kind and distribution of tissue in living organisms.The present invention relates to a method for determining the kind and distribution of tissue in living organisms, as stated in the introductory part of claim 1.There have been developed a number of methods for investigation of organic tissue. Many of these methods can only be used with dead tissue. Candling of fish fillets using visible light to uncover remaining bones, is a well known example of such a method. The method is manual or automatic, and is conducted by the fish fillet being transported over a backlit transparent glass plate. The pieces which do not satisfy certain standards, are rejected. Candling of eggs is another example. However, the candling methods generally cannot be used in a simple manner with living, undivided organisms which in practice are often impenetrable by light. Candling investigations by a human observator may also lead to great stress for the person performing the work, since a very strong light must be used.For living material, it is known to use X-rays and ultra sound. X-rays have the disadvantage that extensive shading must be put in place. For ultra sound difficulties arise due to the interferance noise in the method. The method is also poor in differentiating between tissues having the same density.The article "Protein, fett og vann i fisk kan males ved infrar√∏dt lys", by Henning M. Sollid, Fiskeriforskning nr. 1, 1991, describes the use of a more general analytical technique used in fish. The method is called "Near Infrared Transmision" (NIT). The method uses a beam of infrared light transmitted through a sample of crushed tissue, as in this case, of salmon fillet. The sample is of a standarised shape and size. The instrument is successivaly transmits light having 100 defined wavelengths throught the sample. The individual materials in the sample will influence the infrared light. The influence will vary with the wavelength in a way which is specific for the material that is measured. The part of the light which shines through the sample is registered and the result is processed in a computer. The measuring results are compared with stored comparative values for matter to be measured. The comparative values are determined by conducting measurements in a great number of samples which then are analysed chemically. The method is an alternative to routine chemical analysis. The method is well suited for homogeneous 

material but can not be used in a section where tissues of different kinds
