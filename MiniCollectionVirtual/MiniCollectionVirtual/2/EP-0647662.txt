<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a particulate vinyl 
polymer and also to a water-base coating composition 
using the particulate vinyl polymer. More specifically, 
this invention is concerned with a particulate 
vinyl polymer excellent in workability such as the 
solubility in an aqueous medium and also with a water-base 
coating composition which can form coating films 
excellent in waterproofness, adhesion and the like and 
which also has excellent pigment dispersibility and is 
hence suited for paints, inks and the like. From the environmental viewpoint, there is an 
ever-increasing demand for water-base coating compositions 
in recent years, leading to the development of a 
wide variety of products. In an emulsion, dispersion or the like of a 
polymer, the polymer is contained in a form distributed 
in water. The emulsion, dispersion or the like therefore 
does not exhibit any substantial increase in viscosity  
 
even when the molecular weight of the polymer 
becomes higher. This makes it possible to use a 
polymer of high molecular weight, leading to the advantage 
that a water-base coating composition capable 
of forming a coating film of excellent physical 
properties can be formulated. Numerous water-base 
coating compositions have hence been developed to date. Whenever dispersion of a pigment at a high concentration 
is needed, however, it is indispensable to 
rely upon the action that an associated polymer surrounds 
the pigment to prevent its re-agglomeration. In 
an emulsion, dispersion or the like in which a polymer 
is contained in a form dispersed in water, it has however 
been difficult to fully prevent such re-agglomeration 
of a pigment, thereby failing to obtain 
sufficient pigment dispersibility. To surround the 
pigment for the prevention of its re-agglomeration, it 
is needed that the polymer must be contained in a form 
dissolved in water. To this end, the development of 
water-soluble polymers has been proceeded with in various 
ways. Typical examples of such water-soluble polymers 
include polyvinyl alcohols and sodium salts of 
polyacrylic acids. These water-soluble polymers are 
however accompanied by many practical inconveniences,  
 
because even after their formation into coating films, 
they are prone to dissolution in water and the coating 
films are thus re-dissolved and damaged by a slightest 
adverse cause such as exposure to water droplets. To overcome the above inconveniences, a technique 
was developed. According to this technique, a polymer 
containing acidic groups
