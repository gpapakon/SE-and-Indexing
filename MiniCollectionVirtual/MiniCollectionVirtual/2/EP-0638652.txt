<ABSTRACT>
An underlayer of nickel or of nickel-based alloy is deposited before the desired operation is undertaken. The underlayer has the effect of protecting the base metal from the embedding of particles or of debris of projectiles which could injure it and of permitting a correct application of compression stress.

<CLAIMS>
Process for hardening a metal workpiece by shot
peening, the workpiece being obtained by pressing and

sintering a powder made of a nickel-based alloy, which
process consists, before the shot peening, in

electrolytically depositing a protective metal layer
made of a nickel or nickel-cobalt alloy, the protective

layer being of a thickness chosen so as to avoid
damaging the workpiece and substantially reducing the

amount of compressive prestress given to the workpiece,
the said thickness being between 0.012 mm and 0
.025 mm.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the protective layer is removed after the shot

peening.
