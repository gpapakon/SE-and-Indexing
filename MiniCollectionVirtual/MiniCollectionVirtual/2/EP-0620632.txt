<ABSTRACT>
Two part-annular section rigid magnets (4 and 5) are held within a cylindrical metal 
casing (1) by means of spacer means (9 and 10) comprising a rigid mild steel insert (9), 

disposed between two free edges (6 and 7) of the magnets, and an additional spacer in 
the form of a resiliently deformable "U"-shaped spring (10), which is disposed between 

another two free edges (28 and 29) of the magnets. The mild steel insert (9) has two 
oppositely-directed lateral extensions (12) disposed in contact with each of the 

magnets (4 and 5) and the closed end (11) of the casing (1) to locate the magnets (4 
and 5) longitudinally within the casing (1). The insert (9) also has locating means (16) 

adjacent the open end of the casing (1) for engagement with complementary locating 

means (15) in an end cap for closing the open end of the casing (1) to locate the end 
cap angularly, relative to the casing (1) and thereby provide optimal commutation. 

The complementary locating means (15) may include an electrically conductive 
member which contacts the insert to provide an earth connection within the end cap. 

Moreover, the insert (9) serves as a magnetic shunt between the magnets (4 and 5) so 
that on magnetization of the magnets (4 and 5), the magnetic axis lies in a second 

plane (8) offset from the longitudinal axis (2) towards the insert (9), thus reducing 
radial vibration of the rotor (24) and noise during operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to permanent magnet direct current (PMDC) motors and in 
particular to means for locating the magnets of PMDC motors. A conventional PMDC motor comprises a casing having a longitudinal axis which lies 
in a plane of symmetry; permanent magnet means which are disposed within the casing 
symmetrically on opposite sides of the plane of symmetry, have at least two 
longitudinally extending free edges, and provide a magnetic field having an axis lying in 
a second plane which extends perpendicular to the plane of symmetry; and spacer 
means of different construction on opposite sides of the second plane, for locating the 
permanent magnet means angularly within the casing. As disclosed in GB 2202383A, the spacer means may comprise two wings, pressed 
from the side wall of the casing on one side of the second plane, but this involves an 
additional stamping operation in the formation of the casing. Further operations are 
necessary to provide means for locating the permanent magnet means longitudinally 
within the casing. Thus, where tabs are pressed from the side wall to provide the 
longitudinal locating means, at least one further stamping operation is necessary. The purpose of this invention is to simplify the production and assembly of PMDC 
motors. This is achieved by using spacer means which include a rigid insert which extends, 
longitudinally, between the two free edges of the magnet means and, transversely, 
across the plane of the symmetry of the motor. According to the invention, there is provided a PMDC motor comprising a casing 
which has a longitudinal axis which lies in a plane of symmetry. Permanent magnet 
means are disposed within the casing symmetrically on opposite sides of the plane of 
symmetry, have at least two longitudinally extending free edges and provide a 
magnetic field having an axis lying in a second plane which extends perpendicular to 
the plane of symmetry. First and second spacer means having a different construction on opposite sides, respectively 
of the second plane, comprise a rigid insert which extends, longitudinally, between the 
two free edges and, transversely, across the plane of symmetry into engagement with 
the two free edges of the permanent magnet means to locate the permanent magnet  
 
means angularly within the casing. The insert is of ferromagnetic material of low 
permeability to provide a magnetic shunt between the free edges of the permanent 
magnet means (or, at least, to provide a more effective magnetic shunt than is provided
