<ABSTRACT>
To provide a compound with a potent ACAT inhibiting activity. An anilide derivative represented by general formula (I) 
and a salt thereof, wherein R¹ and R² may be the same or different from each other and each represents C₁-C₄ 

alkyl; n represents 
0, 1 or 2; A represents C₁-C₁₄ alkylene or -CH₂CO-; and Ar represents phenyl or benzyl each of which may be substituted 

by halogen, nitro, C₁-C₄ alkyl, C₁-C₄ alkoxy, C₂-C₅ alkanoyl or trifluoromethyl, or pyridyl or pyrimidyl each of 
which may be substituted by halogen or trifluoromethyl.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an anilide derivative 
having a piperazine ring and a salt thereof, and more 
particularly to an anilide derivative having a piperazine 
ring and a salt thereof which have acyl-CoA cholesterol 
acyltransferase (hereinafter abbreviated as ACAT) inhibitory 
activity. An ACAT inhibitor is believed to act on the 
atherosclerotic lesions to inhibit accumulation of 
cholesterol esters thereby inhibiting onset and progress of 
atherosclerosis and also act on the mucosa of the small 
intestine to inhibit absorption of cholesterol. It is also considered that an ACAT inhibitor 
suppresses formation of cholesterol esters in the liver, 
which leads to reduction in blood cholesterol level (see V.A. 
Kosykh. et al., Atherosclerosis, Vol. 68, pp. 67-76 (1987)). Among known ACAT inhibitors, the compounds disclosed 
in U.S. Patent 4,623,662, JP-A-60-41655, and JP-A-63-253060 
(the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined 
published Japanese patent application") are structurally 
similar to the anilide derivatives of the present invention 
but their ACAT inhibitory action is not sufficient.  An object of the present invention is to provide a 
compound having a potent ACAT inhibitory activity. As a result of extensive investigations for 
accomplishment of the above object, the inventors have found 
that certain anilide derivatives having a piperazine ring 
exhibit a potent ACAT inhibitory activity and completed the 
present invention. The present invention provides an anilide derivative 
represented by formula (I): 
wherein R¹ and R², which may be the same or different, each 
represent an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; n 
represents 0, 1 or 2; A represents an alkylene group having 1 
to 14 carbon atoms or a group represented by -CH₂CO-; and Ar 
represents a phenyl group, a phenyl group substituted with a 
halogen atom, a nitro group, an alkyl group having 1 to 4 
carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an 
alkanoyl group having 2 to 5 carbon atoms or a 
trifluoromethyl group, a benzyl group, a pyridyl group, a  
 
pyridyl group substituted with a halogen atom or a 
trifluoromethyl group, or a pyrimidyl group, 
or a salt thereof. The details of the present invention will hereinafter 
be described. The alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms is a 
straight- or branched-chain alkyl group. The alkylene group 
having 1 to 14 carbon atoms is a straight-chain alkylene 
group. The halogen atom is a fluorine atom, a chlorine atom, 
a bromine atom or an iodine atom. The
