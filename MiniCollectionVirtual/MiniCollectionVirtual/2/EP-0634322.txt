<ABSTRACT>
A method of feeding a continuous packing machine 
(3) with groups (16) of tobacco items (4), in particular 

cigarettes, composed of at least one layer (17) of items 
(4), whereby a continuously-moving conveyor (19) with 

pockets (18) for respective groups (16) is supplied 
successively with the groups (16), each of which is 

expelled from a feedbox (5) in a substantially 
transverse direction (20) in relation to the items (4) 

by arresting the items (4) inside the feedbox (5) and 
over the expelled items (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
feeding groups of tobacco items, in particular 
cigarettes, to a continuous packing machine, in accordance with the 
preamble of Claim 1. Such a method is known from GB-A-1524463. In the following description, reference will be 
made purely by way of example to the feeding of groups 
of cigarettes to said packing machine. In the tobacco industry, reciprocating cigarette 
packing machines are employed, i.e. wherein the 
cigarettes normally travel in steps and are handled by 
means of reciprocating members. Reciprocating packing machines feature an input 
device comprising a cigarette feedbox normally 
presenting at least three outlets, each defined by a 
number of side by side, substantially vertical channels 
in turn defined by a number of side by side, 
substantially vertical partitions. For each outlet, the input device also comprises a 
fixed box for receiving a group of cigarettes composed 
of at least one layer, and positioned facing the bottom  
 
end of the relative channels. The input device also 
comprises a reciprocating push device for axially 
engaging the cigarettes in the group inside the box and 
expelling them axially from the box into a pocket on a 
conveyor travelling in steps in a direction 
perpendicular to the cigarettes inside the feedbox, and 
which provides for feeding the groups of cigarettes to 
the packing machine. In known input devices of the above type, each 
cigarette, on leaving the bottom output end of the 
respective channel and being positioned inside the box, 
supports the entire column of cigarettes aligned inside 
the respective channel, and is positioned with a 
generating line contacting the bottom cigarette in the 
respective column. Also, both in the upper layer of the 
group inside the box, and in the layers defined inside 
the feedbox by the columns of cigarettes inside the 
respective channels, the adjacent cigarettes are 
separated slightly in a horizontal transverse direction, 
due to the presence of the partitions. Consequently, 
when the group of cigarettes inside the box is moved in 
a substantially horizontal, transverse direction in 
relation to a fixed bottom layer, i.e. in relation to 
the layer defined by the bottom cigarettes in the 
respective columns, each cigarette in the bottom layer 
automatically moves into a pocket defined beneath, and 
by the two columns separated by, each partition, and at 
the same time the cigarettes in the respective columns  
 
drop down once more into contact with the

<CLAIMS>
A method of feeding groups (16) of elongated 
tobacco articles (4) from a feedbox (5) to a continuous 

packing machine (3); each said group (16) being defined 
by at least one layer (17) of articles (4); the feedbox 

(5) having a bottom open end (7) through which said 
groups may be extracted in a first direction extending 

transversely of the articles; and the packing machine 
(3) having an input conveyor (19) which is a pocket 

conveyor advancing, in use, in a continuous manner and 
with a predetermined speed in a second direction (20) 

extending transversely of the articles (4) and the first 
direction; the method comprising advancing the articles 

(4) in said first direction along the feedbox (5) and 
towards said open bottom end (7) and, for each said 

group (16), withdrawing the group (16) from said bottom 
open end (7) in said first direction while arresting, 

within the feedbox (5), all the remaining articles (4) 
arranged above said withdrawn group (16); the method 

being characterised by further comprising accelerating 
the withdrawn group in said second direction to the 

advancement speed of the conveyor to bring and keep said 
group in registry with a pocket (18) of said conveyor 

and, while in registry, feeding the group (16) into the 
pocket (18) by displacing the group in a third direction 

parallel to the articles (33). 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterised  
 

in that said first direction is a vertical direction, and 
each gro
up (16), when being withdrawn from said 
bottom open end (7), is further moved in said first direction to 

a position coplanar with said conveyor (19) after arresting said 
remaining articles (4) inside the feedbox (5). 
A method as claimed in Claim 2, 
characterised in that each said group is further moved 

with a box (15) beneath the outlet (7) of the feedbox (5) 
in said first direction to a position 

coplanar with said conveyor (19). 
and is 

than accelerated in said second direction together with 
the box (15). 
A method as claimed in Claim 2, 
characterised in that 

each said group (16) is moved, when being 
withdrawn from said bottom open end (7), in said 

vertical direction into a first box (15), arranged 
beneath the bottom open end (7), via a second box (53; 

59) located beneath said bottom open end (7) and above 
said first box (15); the second box having a closing 

bottom, which is opened, after arresting said remaining 
articles (4) inside the feedbox (5), to allow the 

articles (4) in said group (16) to fall into the first 
box (15) which is located a given vertical distance from  

 
said bottom open end (7) of the feedbox (5). 
A method as claimed in Claim 4, characterised 
in that the second box (53) is a shift box presenting a 

number of partitions (55) defining a number of 
substantially vertical passages (56); the bottom of the 

second box (53) being opened by moving the second box 
(53) in said second direction in relation to said 

articles (4), from a position wherein each said 
passage (56) interferes with a respective fixed closing 

element (54), to a position wherein each said 
partition (55) interferes with the articles (4) at said 

bottom open end (7) of the feedbox (5). 
A method as claimed in Claim 2, 
characterised in that 

each said group (16) is moved, when being 
withdrawn from said bottom open end (7), in said 

vertical direction into a first box (15), arranged 
beneath the bottom open end (7), via a second box (53) 

and a third box (59) located in series beneath the 
outlet (7) of the feedbox (5); the second box (53) being 

a shift box presenting a number of partitions (55) 
defining a number of substantially vertical passages 

(56); and said remaining articles (4) being arrested 
inside the feedbox (5) by moving the second box (53) 

transversely from a position wherein each partition (55) 
is aligned with a corresponding partition (9) inside the 

feedbox (5), to a position wherein in that each 
partition (55) of the second box (53) interferes with  

 
the articles (4) at the outlet (7) of the feedbox (5). 
A method as claimed in Claim 6, characterised 
in that the third box is provided with closing means 

(64) which are deactivated when the second box (53) is 
in said position of interference, to allow the articles 

(4) in said group (16) to drop down into the first box 
(15).
