<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for receiving light beams, especially a PIR movement detector, having a housing which has at least one window in which first lens segments (LS1), preferably configured as Fresnel lenses, are arranged in such a way that horizontally incident light beams are focused as direct horizontal beams (S1, S2) onto two light sensors (W1, W2) and the two light sensors (W1, W2) are mutually arranged in such a way that the usable sensor detection angle (a1+a2) of both light sensors (W1, W2) is valid. In order to achieve an enlargement of the detection angle, it is proposed that, in the region of at least one light sensor (W1, W2), at least one horizontal reflector (R1, R2) is arranged so that the latter detects further light beams from a horizontal angular region not covered by the light sensors (W1, W2) with their usable detection angle (a1+a2), and these beams reach at least one light sensor (W1, W2) as reflected horizontal beams (S3, S4). It is furthermore provided that the first lens segments (LS1) surround the light sensors (W1, W2) having the at least one horizontal reflector (R1, R2) in a curve-shape to such an extent that they also focus horizontal beams (S3, S4) which are incident outside the usable sensor detection angle (a1+a2).

Device for receiving light beams, especially PIR
movement detector, having a housing which has at least

one window in which first lens segments (LS1), preferably
configured as Fresnel lenses, are arranged in such a way

that horizontally incident light beams (S1, S2) are
focused as direct horizontal beams onto two light sensors

(W1, W2) and the two light sensors (W1, W2) are mutually
arranged in such a way that the usable sensor detection

angle (a1+a2) of both light sensors (W1, W2) is valid,
characterized in that


a) at least one horizontal reflector (R1, R2) is
arranged in the region of at least one light sensor

(W1, W2),
b) the first lens segments (LS1) surround the light
sensors (W1, W2) and the at least one horizontal

reflector (R1, R2) in a curve shape to such an
extent that they also focus additional horizontal

beams which are incident outside the usable sensor
detection angle (a1+a2) in addition angular regions

(b1, b2), and
c) the at least one horizontal reflector (R1, R2) is
arranged so that the additional horizontal beams are

reflected at it and reach at least one of the light
sensors (W1, W2) as reflected horizontal beams (33,

34),
d) the device being constructed symmetrically to a
vertical space-dividing plane (H) and both a left

horizontal reflector (R1) being assigned to a left
light sensor (W1) and a right horizontal reflector

(R2) being assigned to a right light sensor (W2),
and the left and right sensors (W1, W2) being

arranged offset at an angle of 90° from one another,
and, with the aid of the horizontal reflectors (R1,

R2), a left horizontal reflector detection angle
(b1) of 45° being joined onto a left 90° sensor

detection angle (a1) and a right horizontal reflector
detection angle (b2) of 45° being joined onto a 

right 90° sensor detection angle (a2), with the
result that a horizontal total detection angle of

(a1+a2+b1+b2) = 270° is reached.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the lens segments (LS1, LS2) are designed in such a

way that a plurality of principal focusing axes are
produced for the horizontal light beams and the reflection

is carried out via focus-specific reflector segments
of the horizontal reflectors (R1, R2).
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the individual reflector segments are flat or

approximately flat.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the horizontal reflectors (R1, R2)

are fixed on a holder which serves simultaneously also as
a positioner (P) for the two light sensors (W1, W2).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the curve formed by the lens

segments runs out to its two ends in a straight line and
the lens segments lying in the region of the horizontal

reflector detection angles (bl, b2), which segments form
the part running straight out, are aligned with their

central axis on the respective associated light
sensor (W1, W2).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that, on the underside of the housing,

a further window is provided, in which preferably two
lens segments (LS2) are arranged, and in that a left

vertical reflector (R3) is assigned to the left light
sensor (W1) and a right vertical reflector (R4) is

assigned to the right light sensor (W2) in such a way
that incident light beams from below within a first

vertical reflector detection angle (c1) and within a
second vertical reflector detection angle (c2) are

reflected on to the two light sensors (W1, W2).
