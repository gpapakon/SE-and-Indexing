<ABSTRACT>
A spoked wheel has a rim (1) with a plurality of nipple holes (2) engaged each (2) by a nipple (3). The nipples (3) have an inner thread (4) and a spot for applying a torque that allows the nipple to be turned in order to adjust the individual prestress of each spoke. The spoked wheel also has a plurality of spokes (6) provided at the radially outer end with an outer thread (7) which cooperates with the inner thread (4) of the nipple (3). In order to allow the spokes to be exchanged without dismounting the tire, the nipple (3) is supported on the rim (1) by a further thread coupling (8/9). Preferably, the additional thread coupling (8/9) is formed by an outer thread (8) on the nipple (3) that cooperates with an inner thread (9) in the nipple hole (2) of the rim (1). Both thread couplings (8/9, 4/7) differ from each other by their pitch and/or orientation values. This invention allows bicycles in particular to be provided with tubeless tires with a reduced number of parts and a better weight to solidity ratio.
