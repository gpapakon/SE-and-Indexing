<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to heterojunction type 
bipolar transistors, and more particularly, to an 
improvement in a bipolar transistor having a ballast 
resistance. A conventional power control heterojunction type 
bipolar transistor is liable to extraordinarily generate 
heat when a control current is increased. The 
extraordinary heat generation is caused by a positive 
feedback that a transistor generates heat by a collector 
current at the time of operation, the collector current is 
increased by the heat generated, and that the increased 
collector current further increases heat generation. In 
order to prevent such extraordinary heat generation, as is 
disclosed in JP-A- 3-46334, a 
heterojunction type bipolar transistor is known including 
as a ballast resistance a GaAs layer having the same 
conductivity type as that of an emitter layer and an 
impurity concentration lower than that of the emitter 
layer. In Fig. 10, a heterojunction type AlGaAs/GaAs bipolar  
 
transistor as disclosed in JP-A-3-46334 
is schematically shown in section. In this 
transistor, an n+-GaAs subcollector layer 82 is formed on a 
semi-insulating GaAs substrate 81. Subcollector layer 82 
may have a thickness of 500nm (5000Å) and an n type carrier 
concentration of n=5x1018cm-3, for example. On subcollector 
layer 82, formed are an n-GaAs collector layer 83 and a 
collector electrode Ec. Collector layer 83 may have a 
thickness of 500nm(5000Å) and a carrier concentration of 
n=5x1016cm-3. A p+-GaAs base layer 84 is formed on collector layer 
83. Base layer 84 may have a thickness of 70nm(700Å) and a p 
type carrier concentration of p=4x1019cm-3. On base layer 
84, formed are a base electrode Eb and an n-Al0.3Ga0.7As 
emitter layer 85. Emitter layer 85 may have a thickness 
of 80nm(800Å) and a carrier concentration of n=5x1017cm-3. An n--GaAs ballast resistance layer 86 is formed on 
emitter layer 85. Ballast resistance layer 86 may have a 
thickness of 200nm(2000Å) and a carrier concentration of n=1016cm-3 
. On ballast resistance layer 86, sequentially stacked 
are an n+-GaAs contact layer 87 and an emitter electrode 
Ee. Contact layer 87 may have a thickness of 100nm(1000Å) and a 
carrier concentration of n=5x1018cm-3. Fig. 11 schematically shows an energy band structure 
corresponding to the sectional structure of the transistor  
 
of Fig. 10. In Figs. 11 and 10, the same or corresponding 
portions are labeled with the same reference characters.
