<ABSTRACT>
A biological replacement ligament is provided 
which includes a compressible core (12) and 

a separate flexible outer sheath (14) having a first 
end (22), a second end (24), and a generally tubular 

intermediate portion (26). The intermediate portion 
surrounds the compressible core, whereby the 

application of tension between the first and 
second ends causes the intermediate portion to 

constrict upon the compressible core thereby 
allowing elongation of the ligament to modulate 

the tension between the first and second ends. 
The amount of elongation and tension modulation is 

primarily determined by the compressibility of the 
core .

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to prosthetic devices for connecting
tissue, more particularly, to a biological replacement ligament,
which reproduces the function of a natural collateral or
cruciate ligament.Conventionally, damaged anterior cruciate ligaments are
replaced with grafts from other patient tissue, such as tendon
tissue. However, in certain circumstances, the fixation of the
replacement ligament is not adequate, requiring further surgery.
Prosthetic devices have been used in place of natural connecting
tissue, but these devices also exhibit unsatisfactory fixation.
Further, the prosthetic devices do not function as would the
natural anterior cruciate ligament.US Patent 4,255,820 discloses a ligament prosthesis having
a central tubular portion of fabric, which central tubular
portion is elongable along its longitudinal axis to permit the
needed elasticity in use, and tubular end portions joined to
each end of the central portion. The end portions are provided
with pores graduated in size to form a small pore structure
proximate to the central portion and a larger pore structure at
the end distal to the central portion, thereby to permit
controlled tissue ingrowth within the end portions. A
cylindrical core is inserted into the central tubular portion,
so as to provide strain relief throughout the central portion
and into the end portions.U.S. Patent No. 5,147,400 discloses a ligament prosthesis
which is intended to approximate the biomechanical
characteristics of the natural tissue to be replaced or
augmented. U.S. Patent 5,147,400 provides a prothesis having a
core composed of a first yarn and a sheath surrounding the core
and fabricated by a second yarn. However, when significant
tension is applied between the ends of the prothesis,
interstitial tearing of yarns may occur, much tearing of 
individual fibers of a rope under tension. Further, excessive
creep elongation may occur as a result of the extreme forces
placed on the ligament. Thus, under extreme stress, the
prosthesis may be damaged, and therefore may not exhibit the
function of the natural ligament.As is apparent from the foregoing, state of the art
ligament prostheses fail to produce predictable and satisfactory
results of reproducing the function of the natural ligament.It is an object of the invention to provide a biological
replacement ligament which reproduces the function of a natural
ligament, particularly anterior and posterior cruciate
ligaments. It is a further object of the invention to provide a
biological replacement ligament

<CLAIMS>
A biological replacement ligament (10) which reproduces the
function of a natural ligament, comprising

a non fibrous core (12),
and a separate flexibly deformable outer sheath (14) having a

first end (22), a second end (24), and a generally tubular
intermediate portion (26) which surrounds the core

(12), 
characterised in that
 the core is a compressible core and

in that

the outer sheath (14) is constructed and arranged with
respect to the compressible core (12) such that the application

of tension to the first (22) and second ends (24) causes the
intermediate portion (26) to constrict upon the compressible

core (12) thereby allowing elongation of the ligament (10) and
modulation of the tension on the first (22) and second ends

(24), the amount of elongation and tension modulation being
primarily determined by the compressibility of the core (12).
A biological replacement ligament as in claim 1, wherein the
first and second ends (22,24) of the flexible outer sheath

extending beyond respective opposite ends of the compressible

core.
A biological replacement ligament (10) as in claim 1, wherein
the compressible core (12) comprises a flat sheet rolled into a

tube.
A biological replacement ligament (10) as in claim 1, 2 or 3,
wherein the core is formed with at least one hollow cavity.
A biological replacement ligament (10) as in claim 4, further
comprising:


a fibrosis stimulus disposed in the hollow cavity of the
core.
A biological replacement ligament (10) as in claim 1 or 2,
wherein the intermediate portion (26) is constructed of an

interwoven braid (28). 
A biological replacement ligament (10) as in claim 6, wherein
crossover junctures of filaments of the interwoven braid (28)

are joined together.
A biological replacement ligament (10) as in claim 6, wherein
crossover filaments of the interwoven braid (28) are movable

with respect to each other.
A biological replacement ligament (10) as in claim 1 or 2,
wherein the intermediate portion (26) is a mesh.
A biological replacement ligament (10) as in claim 1 or 2,
wherein the intermediate portion (26) is constructed of

perforated film.
A biological replacement ligament (10) as in claim 1 or 2,
wherein the core (12) comprises a first portion (18) having a

degree of compressibility and a second portion (20) having a
different degree of compressibility.
A biological replacement ligament (10) as in claim 1 or 2,
wherein a portion of one of the first and second ends (22,24) is

tubular for receiving a clamping plug.
A biological replacement ligament (10) as claim 1 or 2,
wherein the ligament (10) is constructed of biodegradable

materials.
A biological replacement ligament (10) as in claim 1,
wherein the compressible core (12) is constructed from a solid

material.
