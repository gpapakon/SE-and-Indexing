as defined herein which exhibit antagonist activity at 
V₁ and/or V₂ receptors and exhibit

vivo

antagonist activity, methods for using such compounds 

in treating diseases characterized by excess renal 
reabsorption of water, and processes for preparing such

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new tricyclic
non-peptide vasopressin antagonists which are useful in
treating conditions where decreased vasopressin levels
are desired, such as in congestive heart failure, in
disease conditions with excess renal water reabsorption
and in conditions with increased vascular resistance
and coronary vasoconstriction.Vasopressin is released from the posterior
pituitary either in response to increased plasma
osmolarity detected by brain osmoreceptors or decreased
blood volume and blood pressure sensed by low-pressure
volume receptors and arterial baroreceptors. The hormone
exerts its actions through two well defined receptor
subtypes: vascular V1 and renal epithelial V2 receptors.
Vasopressin-induced antidiuresis, mediated by
renal epithelial V2 receptors, helps to maintain normal
plasma osmolarity, blood volume and blood pressure.Vasopressin is involved in some cases of congestive
heart failure where peripheral resistance is
increased. V1 antagonists may decrease systemic
vascular resistance, increase cardiac output and prevent
vasopressin induced coronary vasoconstriction.
Thus, in conditions with vasopressin induced increases
in total peripheral resistance and altered local blood
flow, V1-antagonists may be therapeutic agents. 
V1 antagonists may decrease blood pressure, induce
hypotensive effects and thus be therapeutically useful
in treatment of some types of hypertension.The blockade of V2 receptors is useful in
treating diseases characterized by excess renal reabsorption
of free water. Antidiuresis is regulated by
the hypothalamic release of vasopressin (antidiuretic
hormone) which binds to specific receptors on renal
collecting tubule cells. This binding stimulates
adenylyl cyclase and promotes the cAMP-mediated incorporation
of water pores into the luminal surface of
these cells. V2 antagonists may correct the fluid retention
in congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis,
nephrotic syndrome, central nervous system injuries,
lung disease and hyponatremia.Elevated vasopressin levels occur in congestive
heart failure which is more common in older
patients with chronic heart failure. In patients with
hyponatremic congestive heart failure and elevated
vasopressin levels, a V2 antagonist may be beneficial
in promoting free water excretion by antagonizing the
action of antiduretic hormone. On the basis of biochemical
and pharmacological effects of the hormone,
antagonists of vasopressin are expected to be therapeutically
useful in the treatment and/or prevention of
hypertension,
