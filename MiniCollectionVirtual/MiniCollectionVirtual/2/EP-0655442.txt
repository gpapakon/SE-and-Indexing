antagonism, especially Substance P antagonism, Neurokinin
A antagonism, Neurokinin B antagonism, and the like, to a
process for preparation thereof, to a pharmaceutical
composition comprising the same, and to a use of the same
as a medicament.Accordingly, one object of the present invention is
to provide new and useful piperazine derivatives and a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof which have
pharmacological activities such as Tachykinin antagonism,
especially Substance P antagonism, Neurokinin A
antagonism, Neurokinin B antagonism, and the like.Another object of the present invention is to provide
a process for the preparation of said piperazine 
derivatives and a salt thereof.A further object of the present invention is to
provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as an
active ingredient, said piperazine derivatives and a

provide said piperazine derivatives or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as a medicament, in particular as Tachykinin
antagonist, especially Substance P antagonist, Neurokinin
A antagonist or Neurokinin B antagonist. Further, an object of the invention is to provide a use of said derivative for the manufacture of a medicament for treating or preventing Tachykinin-mediated diseases,
for
example, respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis,
