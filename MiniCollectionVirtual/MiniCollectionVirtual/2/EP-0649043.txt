<ABSTRACT>
A raster scanning system is disclosed which utilizes a post poiygon optics (60) which is 
capable of reducing both differential bow and field curvature. The post polygon optics (60) of 

this invention comprises two lenses (90,98) and a wobble correction mirror(92). First lens (98) has 
a spherical concave surface (102) on the side which receives the light beams (48,50) and a cross 

scan cylindrical convex surface (100) on the side that the light beams (48,50) exit the lens. Second 
lens (90) has a cross scan cylindrical concave surface (94) on the side which receives the light 

beams (48,50) and a spherical convex surface (96) on the side that the light beams (48,50) exit the 
lens and the wobble correction mirror (92) has a cross scan cylindrical concave surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a raster scanner, and more particularly, to a raster scanner
system which utilizes optical elements for compensating a differential bow of a scan line, according to claim 1.Referring to Figure 1, a conventional raster scanner system 10 utilizes a light source
12, a collimator 14, pre-polygon optics 16, a multi-faceted rotating polygon mirror 18 as the
scanning element, post polygon optics 20 and a photosensitive medium 22. The light source 12,
which can be a laser source, produces a light beam 24 and sends it to the rotating polygon mirror
18 through the collimator 14 and the pre-polygon optics 16. The collimator 14 collimates the light
beam 24 and the pre-polygon optics 16 focuses the light beam in the sagittal or cross scan plane
onto the rotating polygon mirror 18.The rotating polygon 18 has a plurality of facets 26, each of which is a plane mirror.
The facets 26 of the rotating polygon mirror 18 reflect the light beam 24 and also cause the
reflected light 24 to revolve about an axis near the reflection point of the facet 26 of the rotating
polygon mirror 18. This reflected light beam can be utilized through the post polygon optics 20 to
scan a document at the input end of an imaging system as a raster input scanner or can be used to
impinge upon a photographic film or a photosensitive medium 22, such as a xerographic drum
(photoreceptor), at the output of the imaging system.The post polygon optics 20 comprises two spherical lenses 28 and 30, which both
together are called F-theta lens, and a wobble correction mirror 32. The lens 28 is spherical
concave on the side which receives the light beam and planar on the side that the light beam exits
the lens and the lens 30 is planar on the side which receives the light beam and spherical convex
on the side that the light beam exits the lens. The wobble correction mirror 32 is a concave
cylindrical mirror in the cross scan plane.In real world situations, a raster scanner typically includes a number of lenses and
mirrors to accommodate a specific design. Unavoidable imprecision in the shape and/or
mounting of these optical elements will inevitably introduce certain anomalies in the quality of
the scan line on the photoreceptor. One of such anomalies is a bow.Bow is an undesirable character of a scan line which does not form a straight line and
bows about a central midpoint. An example of a bow is shown by scan line 34 in Figure 2.
Depending on the types of imprecision in the construction of the apparatus, the bow may bend in
either
