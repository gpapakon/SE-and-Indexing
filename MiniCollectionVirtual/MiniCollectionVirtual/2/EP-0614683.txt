<ABSTRACT>
The machine is provided for many types of physical 
exercises to be performed and includes a column (1) that 

works with a beam (5) pivoted to it and allows the column 
to be stably positioned to enable the exercises to be 

performed, the machine comprising lines attached to 
resisting means, which lines are attached to a top rod 

(12), a yoke (15) passing through a pivoting part (14), 
which can be manually pulled by the user overcoming the 

resistance of the resisting means, and likewise 
comprising a grip (18) linked to such lines, which pass 

through different pulleys relating the said resisting 
means (23) which comprise a rubber stay replacing the 

classic weights fitted in gymnastics machines-of this 
kind. The column (1) is moreover fitted with a seat to 

which a front rod (10) is pivoted, though which the line 
(17) ending at the lower end grip (18) passes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a collapsible physical 
exercising machine and in particular to what is known as 
a gymnastics apparatus with which a large number of 
physical exercises can be performed, namely muscular 
development of the biceps, strengthening of the legs, 
including press-ups, sit-ups and push-ups. There are many types of gymnastics apparatus 
designed to allow the user to perform a wide assortment 
of physical exercises, among which there are apparatus 
that enable the user to perform various types of 
exercises by merely changing his position, grasping a 
particular lever and so forth. Now then, this type of gymnastics apparatus relies 
upon the resistance that must be overcome to lift a 
number of weights mounted upon a column and attached to 
stays running through pulleys and that are in turn 
connected to the various means the user must grasp or 
lean upon to perform the physical exercises. The said weights can obviously vary in number in 
order for the apparatus to offer a greater resistance to 
be overcome, which means that the mounting column for the 
weights must be large, and protected with a frame or 
suitable means preventing manipulation of the weights 
whilst exercising, in order to prevent accidents.  This drawback is further complicated by the fact 
that the apparatus is altogether very heavy, structurally 
complex and large, which in addition to the high economic 
cost, means that it may only be kept inside gymnasiums 
and like locations, for at home it would be necessary to 
have large spaces that would obviously reduce the house's 
living space, which means that an amateur user of this 
type of apparatus must usually go to a gymnasium to 
exercise himself as above. The apparatus or machine subject hereof has been 
designed to fully overcome these problems, and therefore 
being of a simple construction, little weight and in 
addition collapsible, it allows many types of exercises 
to be performed and can moreover be used at home because 
of the little space it takes up which is indeed less when 
the apparatus is folded or in a position of non-use, 
allowing the same to be stored anywhere at home without 
taking up too much space. Furthermore, an essential feature of the apparatus 
or machine is that instead of the weights that constitute 
the resistance the user must overcome in exercising, a 
rubber stay is provided, together with means with which 
to adjust the tension of the rubber stay and hence adjust 
its resistance that must be overcome by the user when 
exercising.

<CLAIMS>
1.- A collapsible physical exercising machine 
constituting a gymnastics apparatus allowing many types 

of physical exercises to be performed by the user, with 
the user either sitting down or in any other position, 

and being based upon lines connected to user driving 
elements to overcome a resistance forming part of the 

machine as a whole, characterised in that the means 
constituting the resistance to be overcome by the user in 

physically exercising himself comprise a rubber stay (23) 
connected with respective lines (17) and (17') passing 

through different pulleys and connected to a front top 
rod (12), to a yoke (15) likewise located at a top 

position, to a lower front grip (18) and to means (29) 
with which the tension of the rubber means (23) 

constituting the staying means to overcome can be 
adjusted. 
2.- A collapsible physical exercising machine, as in 
claim 1, characterised in structurally comprising an 

elongate column (1) having small lower branches (3) and 
a crosspiece (4) on a beam (5) pivoted to the rear of the 

column (1), and establishing a stable position of the 
machine to be used, the top end being provided with a 

forward overhead projection (2) from which a rod (12) is 
suspended, which rod is attached to one of the ends of 

the stay (17) while its other end, after passing through 
the respective pulleys and through a pulley (22) provided 

at one of the ends of the rubber stay (23), reaches the 
lower grip (18) that passes through a rod (10) pivoted to 

a projection (7) acting as a support for a seat (8), the 
latter located on the front portion and at an area 

comprised between the beam (5) pivot and the lower 
portion or end of the column (1) as such. 
3.- A collapsible physical exercising machine, as in 
the above claims, characterised in that the top front 

overhead projection (2) on the column (1) is fitted with 
a pivoted part (14) traversed by the yoke (15), which 

pivoted part supports a pulley (28) through which the 
second line (17) attached to the other end of the rubber 

stay (23) and to the actual tightening means (29) passes, 
being particular in that the grips (13) on the rod (12) 

are located above the user's head when the user is 
seated, whereas the grips (16) on the yoke (15) lie 

almost at the waist of the user when seated. 
4.- A collapsible physical exercising machine, as in 
the above claims, characterised in that the adjuster (29) 

is attached to a lever (30) that can take up several end 
positions, each of which will define a degree of tension 

for the rubber stay (23).
