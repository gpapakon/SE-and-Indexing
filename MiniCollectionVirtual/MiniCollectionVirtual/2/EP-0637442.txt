<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic apparatus for health and beauty includes a main body 
(1) having a grip portion (2), a hollow cylindrical roller (7) supported 

rotatably at one end of the main body (1), and an ultrasonic generating 
unit (9) disposed in the hollow cylindrical roller (7), wherein the 

hollow cylindrical roller (7) itself constitutes an ultrasonic vibrator 
which is excited by the ultrasonic vibrating unit (9). The apparatus may 

be further provided with a heat source, such as an incandescent lamp 
(13), accommodated in the hollow cylindrical roller (7) for heating the 

roller, a temperature sensor (16) disposed on the hollow cylindrical 
roller (7) or in a vicinity thereof, and a control unit for maintaining 

the hollow cylindrical roller (7) at a predetermined temperature on the 
basis of an output signal from the temperature sensor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic apparatus for health and beauty.It is already known that ultrasonic waves are effective for health and beauty. A
known apparatus for health and beauty which employs ultrasonic waves is disclosed in
US-A-4823042, upon which the preamble of claim 1 is based, and
which discloses the same subject matter as JP-A-3123559. In this
known apparatus, a disk-like vibration-transmitting plate for being brought into contact
with the skin. This ultrasonic apparatus for the health and beauty comprises a main
body having a grip portion; and an ultrasonic generating unit.However, with the apparatus of the above-descriped US patent 4823042, it is
possible to obtain merely the effect based on ultrasonic waves, and a synergistic effect
incorporating the effect of another method cannot be expected.The publications DE-A-3241094 and JP-U-215131 both disclose that a
massage roller arranged at the end of a main body can be combined with a
vibration means, however they are both
provided with a rotating electric motor. Further in both the devices is the
motor arranged in the handle and the vibrating energy is transmitted to the roller
through a roller bearing portion. The present invention has been devised in view of the above-described
circumstances, and it is an object of the present invention to provide an unltasonic
apparatus for health and beauty having improved efficiency.To this end, in accordance with the present invention, there is provided an
ultrasonic apparatus for health and beauty, in accordance with claim 1. By arranging
the ultrasonic generating unit inside a roller supported at the end of the main body
a synergistic effect of ultrasonic "micro" massaging treatment is provided together
with a traditional massaging effect provided by the roller.In addition to the above-described arrangement, the hollow cylindrical roller
may be formed of a material which radiates far-infrared rays. In this case, the thermal
effect of far-infrared rays can be exhibited in a synergistic manner. As such a far-infrared
radiant material, one having a high emissivity is preferable, and it is possible to
cite a resin such as a cullulose acetate resin. The apparatus of the present invention having the
above-described construction is used by bringing the hollow
cylindrical roller into contact with the skin and rolling
the same.First, if a supply switch (not shown) is turned on and
high-frequency power is supplied, the hollow cylindrical
roller itself acts as an ultrasonic vibrator and imparts
