<DESCRIPTION>
Process for producing thermally stable polyoxymethylene copolymers and their use.This invention relates to a process for producing a polyoxymethylene copolymer having an improved heat stability and their use for the production of moldings. More particularly, it relates to a process for producing a polyoxymethylene copolymer containing a reduced number of unstable terminals and having an improved heat stability by using a specific compound for deactivating a catalyst in the cationic copolymerization of trioxane with a cyclic ether or a cyclic acetal.Polyoxymethylene (hereinafter referred to simply as POM) homopolymers and copolymers have been known for a long time as versatile thermoplastic molding material of construction, particularly in engineering and manufacturing. In many cases it can be used as a substitute for metals on account of its outstanding mechanical properties, such as high rigidity, hardness and strength and the fact that it is possible to produce moldings and molded parts to strict tolerance limits, and their good resistance to many chemicals.A common polymerization process for producing the POM polymers comprises using a cyclic acetal such as trioxane as a main monomer and a cyclic acetal or a cyclic ether having adjacent carbon atoms as a comonomer, further adding a chain transfer agent for controlling the degree of polymerization depending on the purpose copolγmerizing these monomers with the use of a cationically active catalyst, and then contacting the polymerization product with an agent for neutralizing or deactivating the catalyst or a solution thereof to thereby deactivate the catalyst.After the completion of the copolymerization, the obtained crude POM polymer generally contains a considerably large amount of unstable terminals and, 

therefore, it is necessary to stabilize the POM polymer by eliminating the unstable parts therefrom. Thus, a complicated post-treatment process spending much energy is required therefor, which causes an economic disadvantage. When a crude POM copolymer containing a reduced amount of unstable parts is obtained after the polymerization, advantages such that the final product has an improved stability and that the post-treatment including stabilization can be simplified can be achieved. Accordingly, it has been desired to establish a process for producing a polymer containing a reduced amount of unstable parts in polymerization. Since a catalyst cannot be completely deactivated by the conventional deactivation treatments, depolymerization occurs
