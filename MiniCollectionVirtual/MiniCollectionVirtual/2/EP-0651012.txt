<ABSTRACT>
A propylene random copolymer composition 
which contains a mixture of 0.05-2.7% by weight of a 

crystalline propylene homopolymer (A) and 97.3-99.95% 
by weight of a random copolymer (B) of propylene and 

at least one α-olefin other than propylene which 
copolymer has a bound propylene content of 40-85% by 

weight and a Mw/Mn of not more than 5.5 meets both of 
the two mutually conflicting requirements of further 

improving the transparency inherent to polypropylene 
sheet and film, and attaining excellent solvent 

resistance.-

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a propylene
copolymer composition. More specifically, it relates
to a propylene copolymer composition which gives molded
articles having a good balance between solvent resistance
and transparency and exhibits a quite satisfactory
heat sealability when formed into a film.Polypropylenes, which have many desirable
physical properties, have been applied to wide variety
of uses. For example, they have been widely used in
the field of packaging films. In this field of use
they are generally supplied as propylene random
copolymers in which propylene is randomly copolymerized
usually with ethylene and/or an α-olefin other than
propylene in order to improve the heat sealability at
low temperatures. Such propylene random copolymers
have a low crystallinity, low melting point, high
transparency and high heat sealability attributable to
highly random copolymerization of the comonomers.
However, they have a problem of remarkable increase of
solubility to organic solvents (e.g. saturated hydrocarbon
solvents), which may threaten the safety of
foods, with the increase of the content of ethylene
and/or an α-olefin other than propylene.On the other hand, there has been known a
method for improving the blocking resistance and 
mechanical strength of propylene random copolymer compositions
by modifying a random copolymer of propylene
and an α-olefin other than propylene by incorporating
thereinto 5-50% by weight of an isotactic polypropylene
(JP-A-54-48846 and JP-A-54-95684). However, the method
merely serves to keep the level of transparency and
heat sealability at low temperatures. It is still
unsatisfactory to meet the requirement to provide a
propylene random copolymer composition with a good
balance between solvent resistance and transparency.
Specifically, increasing the proportion of isotactic
polypropylene for improving the solvent resistance
broadens the distribution of the composition and
adversely affects the transparency. Use of random
copolymers of low crystallinity alone for improving the
transparency, in turn, notably reduces the solvent
resistance. Thus, the method cannot solve the problem
underlying the present invention.There have also been known various methods
for improving the transparency of propylene random
copolymer compositions by adding thereinto any nucleating
agent (JP-A-59-164348, JP-A-62-132937 & JP-A-2-51548).
However, nucleating agents are generally
expensive due to their complicate structure and
technical difficulty in production. Therefore, these
methods
