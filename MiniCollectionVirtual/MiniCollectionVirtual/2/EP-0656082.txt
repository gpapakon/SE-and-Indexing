<DESCRIPTION>
The current invention concerns a process for 
microstructuring surfaces of oriented polymeric substrates 
using laser radiation. More specifically, the invention 
involves a process wherein the laser radiation intensity 
is spatially modulated in a predetermined periodic manner. 
The process is especially useful for microstructuring the 
surfaces of textile products. Synthetic melt-spun polymeric fibers, such as 
polyamide or polyester fibers, typically have smooth 
surfaces which give rise to undesirable specular 
reflection. Fabrics prepared from such fibers are 
perceived by consumers to have a less desirable appearance 
than fabrics prepared from natural fibers such as cotton 
or wool. Cotton and wool have irregular, rough surfaces 
which do not give rise to specular reflections. Also, 
consumers tend to prefer the tactile aesthetics of natural 
fibers over those of melt-spun fibers. The preferred 
tactile aesthetics of these fibers are also believed to be 
due to their irregular surface which reduces the contact 
area with the skin. Bossman & Schollmeyer, U.S. Patent 5,017,423 and 
Schollmeyer & Bahners, Melliand Textilber. No. 4:251-6 
(1990) disclose forming microstructures on the surfaces of 
synthetic fibers by exposing the fibers to laser 
radiation. The microstructured surfaces cause the 
specular reflection to be broken up, resulting in a fiber 
appearance closely resembling that of natural fibers such 
as cotton or wool. Generally in such operations, laser 
radiation in the ultraviolet region is employed due to 
strong absorption of the photons in this region by the 
synthetic polymeric fibers. Excimer-type lasers are  
 
commonly used to generate such radiation, but these lasers 
are generally impractical for long-term industrial use 
because of the costs associated with short electrode life 
and window fouling. It is also known that such polymeric substrates 
have absorption bands in the infrared (IR) region which 
coincide with wavelengths emitted by known wavelength-tunable 
lasers, such as CO2 and CO lasers. However, 
attempts to use such lasers in accordance with the above-described 
excimer laser methods in order to microstructure 
fiber substrates have been unsuccessful. Even as the 
"fluence" is increased, no microstructuring effect is 
observed; rather, the fiber eventually melts at a certain 
fluence level. The term "fluence" denotes the energy in 
J/cm2 that is delivered to and absorbed by the fibers when 
a laser pulse is directed towards them. The current invention provides a

beam having a coherence length of at least 5 mm that has been

oriented polymeric substrate will absorb the radiation with an 
absorbance of at least 1000 cm

into two coherent beams and the coherent beams combined 

at an angle to produce said interference pattern wherein, 

the oriented polymeric substrate absorbs the radiation 
with an absorbance of at least 1000 cm

the surface of the oriented polymeric substrate exposed 

to the interference pattern to a depth of approximately 
1 µm with little or no loss of weight of the substrate 

and forming a layer having a wavy microstructure and a loss 
of orientation.
