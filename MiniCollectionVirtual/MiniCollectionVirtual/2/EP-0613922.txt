<ABSTRACT>
A process for recycling the overspray produced in processes which use water-thinnable (water-dilutable) two-component polyurethane paints (lacquers, surface coatings, varnishes), in which (i) the overspray is collected, optionally with simultaneous dilution with water, (ii) the overspray is reacted, simultaneously with or after process step (i), with compounds which have higher reactivity towards isocyanate groups than does water and the reactive components containing groups which are reactive with isocyanate groups which are also used, and (iii) the resultant aqueous solution or dispersion of the chemically modified overspray is re-used as a single- or multicomponent, chemically and/or physically drying coating composition or as a constituent of a coating composition of this type.

Process for the reutilisation of the overspray 
occurring on spraying water-borne, 2-component 

polyurethane lacquers based on organic polyisocyanates 
and organic polyhydroxyl compounds, characterised in 

that 

(i)
the overspray is collected, optionally with 
concomitant dilution with water, 
(ii)
simultaneously with or after process stage 
(i), the overspray is reacted, optionally in 

the presence of emulsifiers, with such a 
quantity of compounds which have a higher 

reactivity towards isocyanate groups than 
water and than the polyhydroxyl compounds 

used in the 2-component polyurethane 
lacquers, as corresponds to an equivalent 

ratio of highly reactive groups as defined 
in these explanations to isocyanate groups 

of the overspray of 0.5:1 to 50:1, and 
(iii)
the resultant aqueous solution or dispersion 
of the chemically modified overspray is 

reused as a 1-component or multi-component 
chemically and/or physically drying coating 

composition or as part of such a coating 
composition, optionally after removal of 

part of the water or addition of further 
water in order to establish the spraying 

viscosity and optionally after the addition 
of further auxiliary substances and 

additives. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
primary or secondary monoamines with aliphatically  

 
attached amino groups are used in process stage (ii) 

as compounds capable of reacting with isocyanate 
groups. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
aminoalcohols are used in process stage (ii) as 

compounds capable of reacting with isocyanate groups. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
amines with a carboxylate or sulphonate group are used 

in process stage (ii) as compounds capable of reacting 
with isocyanate groups. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
oximes are used in process stage (ii) as compounds 

capable of reacting with isocyanate groups. 
Process according claims 1 to 4, characterised in that 
the chemically modified overspray dissolved or 

dispersed in water is reused in process stage (iii) as 
the polyhydroxyl component or part of the polyhydroxyl 

component of water-borne, 2-component polyurethane 
lacquers. 
Process according to claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that the chemically modified overspray dissolved or 

dispersed in water is reused in process stage (iii), 
optionally with the addition of crosslinking resins, 

as a heat-curable, 1-component lacquer or as a 
constituent of such a lacquer.
