<ABSTRACT>
Fixing attachment (10) for tools of machine tools, comprising a holding block (11) which can be locked with clamping elements (15) to a fixing plate (13) of a machine slide or the like and has first guide means (17) which interact with second guide means (18) of the fixing plate (13). In order to avoid bending moments in the holding block (11) and the fixing plate (13) and large surface pressures between the holding block (11) and the fixing plate (13) due to the high clamping forces occurring and yet permit exact guidance, the holding block (11) and fixing plate (13) have smooth clamping surfaces (12a, b) and one of the guide means (17) is connected to the holding block or the fixing plate in such a way as to be movable perpendicularly to the clamping surfaces but immovable parallel to the clamping surfaces. This ensures that the guide means always interlock free of play but cannot transmit fixing forces.

<CLAIMS>
Clamping device (10), in particular for tools or machine tool 
accessories, comprising a clamping block (11), which is 

arrested by clamping elements (15, 16) on a clamping plate 
(13) of a machine carriage (14) or the like and which 

comprises first guide means (17, 28) which co-operate with 
second guide means (18) of the clamping plate (13), 


characterized in that
 the clamping block (11) and the 
clamping plate (13) have smooth clamping surfaces (12a, 

12b), and that one of the guide means (17, 28) is connected to 
the clamping block (11) or the clamping plate (13) so as to be 

mobile vertically to the clamping surfaces (12a, 12b) but 
immobile parallel to the clamping surfaces (12a, 12b). 
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the mobile 
guide means (17, 28) is supported against the clamping block 

(11) or the clamping plate (13) via at least one spring element 
(20, 34). 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
one guide means (17, 18) is a rail of approximately 

semi-circular cross-section, and the other guide means (18,17) 
is a groove to match the rail. 
Device according to one of Claims 2 or 3, 
characterized in 
that
 the spring element (20, 34) is a leaf spring which is 
singlesidedly attached to the clamping block (11) and to which 

the first guide means (17) is fitted. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in 
that
 the clamping block (11) comprises an adjustable stop 
element (25) for the first guide means (17). 
Device according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the stop 
element (25) is a setscrew (35) having at its end (36) facing  

 
towards the mobile guide means (17, 28) a spring element (37) 

with a press-on element (38). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in 
that
 the first guide means (17) comprises an adjustment 
mechanism (21). 
Device according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the 
adjustment mechanism (21) is composed of a clamping bolt, 

which passes through the clamping block (11) and which can 
be bolted to the first guide means (17) or the spring element 

(20).
