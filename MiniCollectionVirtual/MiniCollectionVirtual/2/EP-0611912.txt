<ABSTRACT>
In order to be able to connect a branch line in a rapid and simple manner onto a main line (10) which is under pressure, a connection piece (20) is fitted in a fluid-tight manner on the outer side of the main line (10). The connection piece (20) comprises a connection stub (23), running horizontally and essentially perpendicularly with respect to the main line (10), and a valve device (22) which is arranged on the connection stub (23) and whose valve body (25) can be optionally moved into a position which releases or shuts off the flow channel (27) of the connection stub (23). At the free end of the connection stub (23), a drilling device (30) is fitted in a fluid-tight manner, by means of which device the wall (11) of the main line (10) can be tapped through the connection stub (23) and the valve device (22). After the tip (33) of the drilling device (30) has been drawn back to behind the valve device (22), the flow channel (27) of the connection stub (23) is closed by means of the valve body (25) and the drilling device (30) is removed. Finally, the branch line is fitted at the free end of the connection stub (23). The connection device is preferably distinguished in that a sleeve (21) or clamp, which encloses the outer side of the main line (10), the housing (24) of the valve device (22), and the connection stub (23) are formed from a single-piece plastic part.
