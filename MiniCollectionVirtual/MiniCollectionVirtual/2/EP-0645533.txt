<ABSTRACT>
A control system which controls engine air/fuel ratio 
and provides a measurement of efficiency in the catalytic 

converter (50) coupled to the engine exhaust. At the end of 
each of a plurality of test periods, one of three selected 

ratios of output signals generated from exhaust gas oxygen 
sensors (44, 52) positioned downstream and upstream of the 

catalytic converter (50) are sampled and the weighted 
average of the selected ratio over a plurality of test 

periods is determined. When the weighted average exceeds a 
reference ratio, an indication of converter efficiency is 

provided. Such an indication is also provided when the 
selected ratio exceeds the weighted average by a preselected 

amount, such as three standard deviations, for a preselected 
number of times. The weighted average is reset to the 

selected ratio when the selected ratio exceeds the weighted 
average by a preselected amount.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to controlling engine air/fuel ratio while concurrently
monitoring the efficiency of a catalytic converter coupled to an engine exhaust.It is known to concurrently provide feedback air/fuel control and monitor of catalytic
converter efficiency in response to exhaust gas oxygen sensors positioned upstream and
downstream of the converter. In one known approach, converter degradation is indicated by
comparing a ratio of downstream to upstream sensor switching frequency to a reference value
while the vehicle is operating over a predetermined time period. In another approach, a ratio
of downstream to upstream sensor amplitude is compared during the predetermined time
period.USP 5119628 disclosed monitoring the ratio of reversal of an upstream and
downstream oxygen sensor of an internal combustion engine having an exhaust catalyst, so as
to determine catalyst deterioration. The test is performed each time the engine has completed
a predetermined operation.There are numerous problems with the above approaches. For example, variations in
an operator's driving habits over the predetermined time period may result in variations of
test results and erroneous failure indications.An object of the invention herein is to concurrently provide engine air/fuel feedback
control and monitoring of converter efficiency with less variation in monitoring results than
heretofore possible.The above object and advantages are achieved, and problems of prior approaches
overcome, by providing both a system and method for controlling engine air/fuel ratio and
concurrently monitoring efficiency of a catalytic converter positioned in the engine exhaust.
In one particular aspect of the invention, the method for controlling engine air/fuel ratio and
concurrently monitoring efficiency of a catalytic converter positioned in the engine exhaust
comprises the steps of:
controlling fuel delivery to the engine in response to an output of an exhaust gas
oxygen sensor positioned upstream of the catalytic converter and an output of an exhaust gas
oxygen sensor positioncd downstream of the catalytic converter,providing a test period each time the engine has completed a predetermined
operation; generating a monitoring ratio of a downstream signal derived from the 
downstream sensor output to an upstream signal derived from the upstream sensor output for
each of the periods;
   characterised by providing a weighted average of the monitoring ratio over a plurality
of the test periods; and indicating degradation in efficiency of
