<DESCRIPTION>
 PLASTIC RELEASE FILM WITH TEXTURED OR NON-PLANAR SURFACEThe present invention relates to a release film, a major utility of which is to protect and carry label stock u: 1 the label is put into use on an appropriate surface.For many years labels have been prepared with an adhesive applied to one side thereof. In instances where the adhesive is a pressure sensitive adhesive, some means had to be provided to protect the adhesive surface in advance of applying the label to the ultimate surface to be labeled. A technique has evolved over the years by which the pressure sensitive adhesive is protected by bringing the adhesive surface into contact with a release layer which has little tendency to aggressively adhere to the pressure sensitive adhesive surface. Thus, a second film having a release surface is brought into contact with the pressure sensitive surface carried by the label protecting the pressure sensitive adhesive until the label is applied to its ultimate surface. It is to be understood that the pressure sensitive adhesive can be applied to the release surface and the label stock thereafter applied to the adhesive surface. On removal of the label the pressure sensitive adhesive will preferentially adhere to the label stock.Release films can be manufactured separately from the label face stock. The release film is manufactured by applying a commercially available release material to one side of the release film and the combination is then convolutely wound into a roll stock. Ultimately this roll stock must be unrolled and slit to a width dimension suited to a particular label dimension. Next a pressure sensitive layer is applied over the release 

 layer and this is mated with the underside of a sheet of label stock. Alternatively the label stock can have the pressure sensitive adhesive applied to it's undersurface which in turn is mated with the release label. Following this, label indicia is printed onto the surface of label and, thereafter, the label is die cut so that it can be separated from the release sheet-label stock combination.During the unwinding of release film roll stock for re-dimensioning purposes, serious problems can arise. After the release material is applied as a coating layer on the substrate and subjected to electron beam curing and during the convoluted winding of the stock, a portion of or a fraction of the release material is transferred to the back side of the release film. Later when this release roll is unwound to receive label stock thereon, and subsequently rewound,

 CLAIMS
1. A release film comprising an oriented thermoplastic polymeric substrate layer having a surface layer comprising an ethylene-propylene block copolymer on one side thereof and a release coating on the other side thereof.
2. A release film according to claim 1 wherein the substrate comprises a polyolefin film and the release coating comprises a silicone-acrylate coating.
3. A release film comprising an oriented thermoplastic polymeric substrate layer having on one side thereof a release coating comprising a silicone-acrylate material, the coating including a quaternary ammonium salt therein.
4. A release film according to claim 3 wherein the quaternary ammonium salt is present in the silicone-acrylate material in an amount from 0.2 to 8% by weight.
5. A release film according to claim 3 or 4 wherein the oriented thermoplastic polymeric substrate has a surface layer comprising an ethylene-propylene block copolymer on the other side thereof.
6. A release film according to any preceding claim wherein the polyolefin substrate comprises a homopolymer, a copolymer or a blend thereof. 


 7. A release film according to claim 6 wherein the homopolymer is polypropylene.
8. A release film according to any preceding claim wherein the ethylene-propylene block copolymer has an ethylene content of less than 20% by weight and a melt flow index from 1 to lOOg/10 minutes.
9. A release film according to claim 8 wherein the block copolymer has an ethylene content from 3 to about 15% by weight.
10. The release film of claim 1 wherein said ethylene-propylene block copolymer surface has a distinct surface texture which causes, during unwind of a roll of said film, a development of reduced electrostatic potential in comparison to a smooth surface and a film which tracks in an unvarying manner.
11. Use in a release film to reduce development of electrostatic potential during unrolling of a surface layer comprising an ethylene propylene block copolymer.
12. Use in a release film to improve tracking of a surface layer comprising an ethylene-propylene block copolymer.
13. Use in a release coating comprising a silicone-acrylate material to prevent transfer of release material to a label surface of a quaternary ammonium salt therein.
