<DESCRIPTION>
It is generally well known that magnetic 
survey tools are disturbed in varying ways by 
anomalous magnetic fields associated with fixed or 
induced fields in elements of the drill string. It 
is further well known that the predominant error 
component lies along the axis of the drill string. 
This latter fact is the basis for several patented 
or patent-applied-for procedures to eliminate the 
along-axis field errors in three-magnetometer survey 
tools. Among these are U.S. Patents 4,163,324 to 
Russell et al; 4,433,491 to Ott et al; 4,510,696 to 
Roesler; 4,709,486 to Walters and 4,818,336 to 
Russell; and U.S. Patent 4,682,421 to Van Dongen. 
All of these methods, in effect, ignore the output 
of the along-axis magnetometer, except perhaps for 
selecting a sign for a square root computation. 
They provide an azimuth output by computation of a 
synthetic solution, either: 
1) by using only the two cross-axis 
magnetometers and known characteristics of the 
earth's field, or 2) by using the cross-axis components 
and an along-axis component computed from the cross-axis 
components and known characteristics of the 
earth's field. Most of these methods require, as the 
known characteristics of the earth field, one or 
more of the following:  
 
1) Field Magnitude 2) Dip Angle 3) Horizontal Component 4) Vertical Component The Walters method requires, as known 
characteristics of the earth field, only that: 
1) The Field Magnitude is constant in 
the survey area. 2) The Dip Angle is constant in the 
survey area.  
The fact that these quantities are constant is all 
that is required. The value of the constant is not 
needed but is derived within the correction 
algorithm. It may be shown that in all of the 
individual methods of the above references, the 
final error in the computed azimuthal orientation of 
the borehole axis is completely independent of the 
along-borehole magnetic measurement and therefore 
the along-borehole component of the drill string 
interference. This is true because that measurement 
is simply not used in any manner that affects the 
final computed result. However, it may also be 
shown that all of the cited methods introduce other 
errors that are functions of the sensor errors for 
those sensor outputs used, errors in the reference 
information related to the earth's magnetic field 
used in the solutions, and the orientation of the 
borehole axis in azimuth and inclination. These 
factors lead to a result that no single method of 
compensation for drill string interference will
