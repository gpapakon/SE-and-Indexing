<ABSTRACT>
Improved composite structure for damping out vibrations, comprising at least two superposed plates of elastic material, respectively an underneath plate designed to come into contact with the ground, and a top plate (B) designed to receive the assembly emitting the vibration to be damped out, these plates being in mutual contact via their opposite faces including straight grooves (11, 12) of complementary profile, the projecting parts of one plate being nested in the corresponding hollow parts of the other plate, is characterised in that the outer face (15) of the top plate (B) has a border (25) in relief including, in the region of the upper face (15), a cutout (26) located in the same plane as this outer face (15).

An improved composite structure for the damping of vibrations, 

comprising at least two superposed plates (A and B) made 
of a resilient material, respectively one bottom plate (A) intended 

to come into contact with the ground, and a top plate (B) 
intended to receive the unit emitting the vibrations to be 

damped, these plates being in mutual contact by their opposed 
sides (1, 10), comprising straight corrugations (2, 3; 11, 12) of 

a complementary profile, the projecting portions of one plate 
being fitted in the corresponding recessed portions of the other 

plate, 
characterized in that
 the external side (15) of the top 
plate (B) has a border (25) in relief having at the level of the 

top side (15) a groove (26) disposed in the same plane as this 
external side (15). 
A composite structure according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the groove (26) is intended to receive a rigid plate (30), 

whereon the unit emitting the vibrations comes to bear. 
A composite structure according to one of claims 1 to 2, 
characterized in that this rigid plate (30) has a hollow (41) or 

a bulging part (55) intended to receive and hold a wheel (42) in 
position which is fixed to the end of a foot of the vibrating 

unit. 
A composite structure according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the rigid plate (30) is made of metal, in 

particular of steel, or even of a plastic material. 
A composite structure according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the rigid plate (30) has an opening (31) in 

which a threaded rod (33, 51) comes to be accommodated, which is 
associated with an adjusting nut (34, 54) for setting the level 

of the vibrating unit.  
 
A composite structure according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the plates (A and B) are made of a resilient 

material with an identical or different Shore hardness comprised 
between 25 and 40, preferably close to 30. 
A composite structure according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the plates (A, B, 30) assume the shape of a 

square, and the characteristic border (25) is disposed on two 
adjacent sides (20, 21). 
A composite structure according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the external side of the bottom plate (A), 

intended to come into contact with the ground, has portions in 
relief (6, 7) in the form of a truncated pyramid with a rectangular 

base, disposed as a portion (6) along rows parallel to 
the corrugations (2, 3) and as a portion (7) along rows that are 

inclined or perpendicular relative to these corrugations (2, 3). 
A composite structure according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the external top side (15) of the top plate 

(B) has a plurality of parallel, diagonally disposed grooves (16, 
17), whereon the rigid plate (30) then rests. 
A composite structure according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the external side (15) of the top plate (B) 

has at its centre a recessed socket (18) intended to receive the 
crimped head (37) of the threaded rod (33).
