<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved process for
preparing Factor VIII concentrates.Coagulation of blood is a complex process
requiring the sequential interaction of a large number
of components, nearly all of which are proteins. These
components include fibrinogen and Factors II, V, VII,
VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII. A lack of any of these
components, or a nonfunctional component, can lead to
an inability of the blood to clot when required, with
resultant excessive and life-threatening blood loss to
the patient.Factor VIII is absent or is present at deficient
levels in certain individuals. For example, persons
who have a deficiency (or absence) of Factor VIII,
i.e., persons suffering from hemophilia A, have blood
which either fails to clot or clots only after longer
periods of time than the time required for clotting in
a person who has a normal level of Factor VIII.Factor VIII is present in plasma as a high-molecular-weight
complex (Factor VIII complex), which
includes Factor VIII:C and von Willebrand factor
(Factor VIII:RAg or vWf). Factor VIII:C promotes blood
coagulation. Factor VIII:RAg interacts with platelets 
to promote aggregation of the platelets and, when
incorporated in the Factor VIII complex, acts as a
stabilizer for Factor VIII:C.The primary therapeutic use of Factor VIII has
been its intravenous administration to hemophilia A
patients. In severe cases, relatively high concentrations
of Factor VIII are required. These high concentrations
are obtained by purification and concentration of Factor
VIII. However, purification often leads to instability
and loss of Factor VIII:C activity because of the removal
of Factor VIII:RAg from the Factor VIII complex during
purification. Thus, the resultant purified product is a
mixture of both stable Factor VIII complex and unstable
Factor VIII:C, along with contaminating proteins that have
not been removed. Since these solutions contain an
undesirably large portion of contaminating and inactive
proteins, and since only Factor VIII:C is effective in
treating hemophilia A patients, larger amounts of proteins
have to be infused into patients than would be required if
all the purified protein were active Factor VIII:C.Some processes for producing Factor VIII
concentrate have been based on a discovery by Poole et al.
(Nature, 203, p. 312 (1964)) that the precipitate
remaining after plasma is frozen and then thawed, ie. the
cryoprecipitate, contains Factor VIII in a concentrated
form and excludes various other protein fractions. It was
discovered that, in

A process for separating Factor VIII complex
from an impure protein fraction containing Factor VIII

complex, the process comprising the steps of:

providing an aqueous solution of an impure
protein fraction comprising Factor VIII complex;
applying the impure protein fraction solution to
a heparin-coupled chromatographic medium to thereby bind

Factor VIII complex to the heparin;
eluting the Factor VIII complex from the
chromatographic medium using an aqueous solution

comprising CaCl

comprises the additional steps of
adding a sufficient amount of glycine and sodium
chloride to the eluate to thereby precipitate Factor VIII

complex;
washing the Factor VIII complex precipitate with
a wash solution; and
recovering the washed Factor VIII complex.
The process of Claim 1 wherein the CaCl

present in the solution at a concentration of from about

0.01M to about 0.3M.
The process of Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the
impure protein fraction is applied to the heparin-coupled

chromatographic medium in a batch process.
The process of any preceding claim wherein the
recovered Factor VIII complex precipitate has a specific

activity, with respect to the Factor VIII:C activity, of
about 70 to 150 units/mg.
A process for separating Factor VIII complex
from an impure protein fraction containing Factor VIII

complex, comprising the steps of:

providing an aqueous solution of an impure
protein fraction containing Factor VIII complex;
applying the impure protein fraction solution to 
a chromatographic medium comprising a heparin ligand

coupled to a resin;
binding Factor VIII complex to the heparin
ligand on the chromatographic medium;
eluting the Factor VIII complex from the
chromatographic medium using an aqueous solution

The process of any preceding claim wherein the
Factor VIII complex is precipitated from the eluate with

about 1.5M to about 2M glycine and about 1M to about 2M

The process of any preceding claim wherein the
wash solution comprises about 0.025M histidine, pH 6.8, 2M

glycine, and 1.3M sodium chloride.
The process of any preceding claim wherein the
