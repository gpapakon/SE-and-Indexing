<ABSTRACT>
Device for the stepwise and positionedly displacement of objects (3) 
- which are in friction contact with a continuously moving conveyor - 

along a processing or treatment station. The positioning means are formed 
by at least one worm (7) that is rotatably mounted about an 

axis (8) parallel to 
the travelling direction and projects with its helical rib (10) into the 

conveying path of the objects (3) and fits between two successive 
windings of 

the rib (10), the upstream flank (10a) of the rib (10) being 
provided - at angularly 

(pitch angle α) spaced locations along the 
helix - with flattenings (11) that 

lie in planes that are perpendicular to the axis (8), said 
worm (7) being mounted 

to be intermittently driven - in angular steps α - in a direction 
opposite to the winding direction of the rib (10), in such a way, 

that the 
projecting part of the object will come to a standstill against a flank 

flattening (11) at the end of each angular step of the worm (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for the stepwise and positionedly 
displacement of objects - which are in friction contact with a 
continuously moving conveyor - along a processing or treatment station, 
blocking means being provided in the conveyance track of the objects, 
which blocking means are periodically active in successive object 
positions. In the field of the conveyance objects it occurs that the 
individual objects from a continuously flow of such objects have to halt 
during a short time in a number of successive, exactly defined positions, 
so that longitudinally (i.e. in the conveying direction) spaced parts of 
the object may be successively processed or treated from a fixed 
processing or treating station. An example of this is the stepwise filling of baking trays, which are 
supplied in a continuous flow to a filling station and are delivered 
after filling. Such baking trays comprise a series of cavities positioned 
one after the other as seen in the conveying direction, and the stepwise 
displacement of the baking tray must bring the cavities one after the 
other in a position directly under a filling opening in order to be 
filled. For this purpose the baking trays have to be displaced past the 
filling station within the filling zone in steps that correspond with the 
spacing of the successive cavities and to halt after each step in a well-defined 
position. With a well-known device of the type above referred to, the periodically 
active blocking means are formed by lateral blocking members that 
are positioned along the conveying path and comprise an operative 
clamping part adapted to enter - at intervals determined by the desired 
steps - into the conveying track to laterally engage the respective 
object so as to cause the latter to halt for a short time, while the 
conveyor is moving on slippingly. In this manner it is very difficult to 
obtain exactly defined positions of the object (baking tray) in the 
successive treatment positions (filling positions). Moreover these well-known 
blocking means are susceptible for interference. The present invention provides for a solution of this drawback, which 
consists therein, that the periodically active blocking means are formed 
by at least one worm, which is journalled about an axis parallel to the 
conveying direction and the helical rib of which projects into the 
conveying path of the objects to enter into engagement with a part that  
 
projects from one of these objections and fits between two successive 
windings of the

each angular step of the worm. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized that the angle α is 
360°, so that the flattens are aligned in the travelling direction. 
A device according to claims 1-2, characterized in that the 
flattenings are obtained by locally recessing the rib, which is wound 

according to a regular helix.
