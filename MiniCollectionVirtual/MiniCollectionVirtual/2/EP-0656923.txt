<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to fire resistant
and heat insulating compositions and more particularly to
compositions capable of withstanding direct exposure to
flames and high temperatures.Various fire resistant and/or heat insulating
materials or compositions are known. For example, masonry
materials, such as fire brick, are capable of providing
a fire or heat barrier, but are of limited usefulness as
a fire resistant coating because these materials are
generally not available in a pliant, moldable form.
Furthermore, masonry materials are heavy and cumbersome
to use, as well as costly. Drywall, which is typically
comprised of compressed gypsum sandwiched between
paperboard panels, is often used as a fire barrier, but
its fire resistance properties are dependent upon the
thickness of the drywall. Generally, drywall that is at
least 16 mm (5/8") thick is considered "fire resistant
drywall". Even though considered "fire resistant",
drywall of this thickness will readily burn when directly
exposed to flames. Therefore, "fire-resistant" drywall
is not considered an effective fire barrier for high
temperature applications or applications involving
exposure to flames. Furthermore, drywall is not suitable
for coating and molding applications.Another group of fire and heat resistant compositions
are those that contain asbestos. Although asbestos-containing
compositions are considered effective in
providing fire-resistance and heat insulating properties,
it has been discovered that exposure to asbestos can 
result in adverse health consequences and its use has been
severely restricted. Various non-asbestos containing
fireproofing and insulating compositions have subsequently
been developed which have not been altogether adequate for
high temperature applications.One non-asbestos containing fireproofing composition
is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,851,044. The
composition disclosed therein consists primarily of a
mixture of exfoliated vermiculite, clay, silica, mica,
biotite and an organic adhesive. This composition is of
limited usefulness in high temperature applications
because it cannot withstand exposure to flames. Further,
vermiculite is known to burn when directly exposed to
flames.Other problems have been associated with various
other fire-resistant or heat insulating compositions such
as the release of smoke or noxious fumes when exposed to
high temperatures or flames, the breakdown of the material
after prolonged exposure to high temperatures, or the
unsuitability of a composition for use as a
