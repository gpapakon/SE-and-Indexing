<DESCRIPTION>
 Peptide Nucleic Acids and Their Effect on Genetic MaterialBackground of the InventionThe prevention of gene transcription and/or gene translation at the DNA/mRNA level is attractive for many reasons. Classical approaches to drug discovery involve the design and identification of compounds directed against unrelated proteins such as enzymes, receptors or ion channels, the structure and mode of action of which are usually very complicated and often poorly understood. Conversely, the potential for therapeutic intervention at the nucleic acid level follows a well ordered, generalizable strategy which is targeted at the initiating events of an amplifying cascade; thus transcription of a gene gives rise to many copies of mRNA which on translation affords an even greater number of protein molecules. Inhibition of gene expression ought, therefore, to be more efficient than inhibition of the gene product.Anticancer therapy using DNA binding or modifying drugs is well established, however, current agents such as doxorubicin, mitoxantrone and cisplatin (Scrip's Cancer Chemotherapy Review 1991) are not capable of recognizing specific gene sequences, and therefore, lack selectivity, discriminating only poorly between cancer and normal cells. A synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), can provide absolute specificity of action since statistically the sequence defined by any linear combination of the four heterocyclic bases, adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T), to form an oligonucleotide of 17 residues in length, occurs just once in the entire sequence of the human genome. Thus, the ODN can bind via Watson-Crick or Hoogsteen base pairing to its complementary base sequence which could, for example, be part of an oncogene implicated in tumorigenesis or an element of genetic material implicated as the dominant cause of a disease phenotype, for instance, a sequence which comprises an essential target within a viral genome.The potential of such 'antisense' (AS) oligodeoxynucleotides to serve as code blocking therapeutic principles was recognized by Zamecnik and Stephenson (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1978, 75, 280) who demonstrated the inhibition of Rous sarcoma virus replication in chick embryo fibroblasts on addition of a tridecamer ODN with sequence complementarity to reiterative sequences in the viral (+) RNA genome. Duplex formation, i.e. the interaction of an AS ODN with an 

 RNA molecule, as a means to achieve inhibition of gene function has received considerable attention of late. The precise
