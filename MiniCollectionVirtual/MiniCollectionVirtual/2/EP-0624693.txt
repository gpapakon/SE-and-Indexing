<ABSTRACT>
In a method and apparatus for the construction of sealing aprons in segments in civil engineering, in which the sealing-apron segments, with shuttering of their end faces by formwork tubes, are constructed by placing hardening construction material and displacing a suspension from the trench, and the formwork tubes are withdrawn when the construction material is stable, the method according to the invention is characterised in that the formwork tubes subdivided into coupled tube lengths, while utilising longitudinal play of the coupling of their tube lengths, are withdrawn in such a way that the tube lengths are set in motion one after the other from top to bottom before the continuous tube length as a whole is set in motion.

Method for the segment-wise manufacture of subterraneous curtains in civil engineering,
wherein subterraneous curtain segments at their front faces are boarded

with suspended forming pipes (1), are build up by introducing hardening building
material in the curtain under displacement of a suspension from the curtain, and the

forming pipes (1) are retracted when the building material is stable, 
characterized
in that
 the forming pipes (1) subdivided into coupled pipe trains (2, 3) are lowered
into the curtain with the couplings (4) of the pipe trains (2, 3) being extended due

to the weight load during suspending, by using the coupling play and after reaching
the installation depth by further lowering the touched-down pipe train the coupling

plays of each individual pipe train (2, 3) are used up from top to bottom and are
brought to a uniform forming diameter, wherein an overlapping portion of the assembled

pipe couplings (4) also is used for forming a subterraneous curtain segment
and that using the longitudinal play of the pipe train coupling during retracting

the pipes, the pipe trains are brought into motion one after the other from top
to bottom before the connected pipe train as a whole is made move.
Device for carrying out the method under claim 1 with a forming pipe subdivided
in its length into several pipe trains, wherein the forming pipes (1) subdivided into

several pipe trains (2, 3) connected by telescope couplings (4) comprise an outside
telescope of the pipe coupling (4) at the lower released end (5) of a pipe train and

a coupling pin (6) of the engaged coupling at the upper end of the lower subsequent
pipe train (3), wherein the outside telescope and the pin (6) are connected by

a rotating joint comprising a longitudinal guide (23 to 26) over the length of the
coupling play. 
Device under claim 2, 
characterized in that
 connecting members (25, 26) are arranged
in the pin (6) and cams (23, 24) are arranged in the overlapping telescopes

(5).
Device under claim 3, 
characterized in that
 said connecting members are built as
coaxial slots (25, 26) and the engaging cams are formed as round pins, the upper

and lower roundings of the slots limiting the coupling play.
Device under claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the coupling halves are supported by
the cams in the connecting members.
