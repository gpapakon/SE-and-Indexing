<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to methods and compounds for
controlling inflammatory processes in humans through mediation of
inflammatory cell proliferation. More particularly, the present
invention is a method for suppressing T-lymphocytes using a class of
novel compounds.Compounds which retard the production of cytokines such as
interleukin-2 (IL-2) are known. For instance, U.S. Patent No.
4,764,503 assigned to Sandoz Ltd., Basel, Switzerland, describes a
compound generically referred to as Cyclosporin A (hereinafter
referred to as "CsA"), and U.S. Patent No. 4,894,366 assigned to
Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals, Osaka, Japan, describes a compound they
designate as "FK506." Both CsA and FK 506 are claimed to inhibit IL-2
production and bind to cellular receptor proteins that possess
Peptidyl Prolyl Isomerase (PPIase) activity (Johansson et al., 1990,
Transplantation 50:10017).It was initially postulated by those skilled in the art that the
specific binding by such compounds to PPIase type proteins led to
inhibition of the protein's isomerase activity which, in turn, led to
inhibition of T-cell proliferation. Thus, these PPIase type proteins
were referred to as "immunophilins", with the cellular receptor
proteins that bound to CsA and FK506 being referred to as
"cyclophilin" and "FK506 binding protein", respectively. FK506
binding protein is also simply referred to as "FKBP" (Harding et al.,
1989, Nature 341:758). Recent publications report that the inhibition of PPIase activity,
in and of itself, is not sufficient for immunosuppressant activity.
However, there is support in the literature that inhibitory binding to
PPIase-type enzymes probably contributes to ultimate T-cell
suppression (Sigal et al. 1991, J. Exp. Med. 173:619).This disclosure presents a new class of synthetic compounds
that both suppress the proliferation of T-cells and inhibit the
isomerase activity of the FKBP-type of PPIases.CsA, a cyclic undecapeptide, has received FDA approval for use
as an adjunct to organ transplant procedures. However, CsA is
administered with caution due to its known toxicity. Currently, CsA is
prescribed in situations where the risks of non treatment outweigh
the risks of its therapeutic complications.As a result, efforts to expand the application of CsA into non
life threatening indications such as chronic maintenance of
autoimmune disorders have been limited by the well-known side
effects of this drug. The use of CsA leads to a variety of disorders
including: nephrotoxicity, such as impairment of glomerular filtration
and
