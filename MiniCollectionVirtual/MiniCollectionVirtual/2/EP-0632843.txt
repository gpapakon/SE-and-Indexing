A method of removing lead and zinc from foundry dust, in 
particular from electric furnace dust, wherein 


the material to be treated is possibly preheated in a first 
furnace (11), then fed to a second furnace (13), here the lead component 

is vaporised by heat treatment, said lead component is removed from the 
furnace by means of a scavenging gas flow and 
the scavenging gas flow which is charged with the lead component 
is cooled down and filtered, and 
then the zinc-bearing residual material is subjected to heat 
treatment in a third furnace (17) under reducing conditions, in that 

operation zinc oxide is reduced, with the formation of zinc vapours, the 
zinc component is removed from the furnace by means of a scavenging gas 

flow and the scavenging gas flow which is charged with the zinc component 
is cooled down and filtered. 
characterised in that 
when using a foundry dust which contains lead-alkali compounds 
or lead chlorides, the material to be treated is heated in the second 

furnace (13) only until vaporisation of the lead-alkali compounds or lead 
chlorides occurs and same are discharged with the scavenging gas flow. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the zinc-bearing 
residual material is subjected to heat treatment in the third 

furnace (17), mixed with a reducing agent in grain or dust form, in 
particular coal, and an oxygen-bearing atmosphere is maintained above the 

residual material-reducing agent mixture, in which atmosphere the 
vaporised zinc is oxidised to form zinc oxide and same is discharged with 

the scavenging gas flow. 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that 
the material to be treated is preheated and dried in the first furnace 

(11) before being introduced into the second furnace (13).  
 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in that 
the foundry dust is pelletised before being introduced into the second 

and third furnaces (13, 11) respectively. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in that 
the material is indirectly heated in at least one of the furnaces (13, 

17, 11) by way of heating chambers. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in that 
the material is rolled around in the heat treatment of the individual 

stages in at least one rotary cylindrical furnace (11, 13, 17). 
A method according to claim 6 characterised in that in method 
stages with temperatures above 700°C the operation of rolling the 

material around is effected in a ceramic rotary cylindrical member of a 
rotary cylindrical furnace (13, 17). 
A method according to claim 6 characterised in that in method 
stages with a temperature below 700°C the operation of rolling the 

material around is effected in a metal rotary cylindrical member of a 
rotary cylindrical furnace (11). 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 8 characterised in that 
the treatment temperature in the second furnace is between 900°C and 

1100°C. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 9 characterised in that 
the treatment time in the second furnace (13) is half an hour to one and 

a half hours. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 10 characterised in  
 

that the treatment temperature in the third furnace (17) is between 
1100°C and 1400°C. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 11 characterised in 
that the treatment time in the third furnace is half an hour to two 

hours. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 12 characterised in 
that heated scavenging gas, in particular hot air (23) is fed to at least 

one of the furnaces (11, 13, 17). 
A method according to claim 5 characterised in that the 
scavenging gas is heated by means of an indirect heat exchanger (20) by 

the hot waste gas from a heating chamber of a furnace (11). 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 14 characterised in 
that the hot combustion waste air from the heating chambers of the third 

furnace (17) is fed to the heating mating chambers of the second and/or first 
furnace (13 and 11 respectively) as heating gas. 
A method according to claim 5 characterised in that the hot 
combustion waste air from the heating chambers of the second furnace (13) 

is fed to the heating chambers of the first furnace (11) as heating gas.
