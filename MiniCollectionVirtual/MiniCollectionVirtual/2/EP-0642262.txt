<ABSTRACT>
An analog multiplier (110) is used for generating an 
output signal that is coupled to a convergence winding of a 

projection television. The analog multiplier multiplies a horizontal 
rate sawtooth signal (HSAW) with a vertical rate parabola signal 

(VPAL1). To prevent temperature related drift, tolerances and 
component aging from affecting the output signal, the multiplier is 

calibrated (VCAL), during each vertical blanking interval (TVBLK), 
by means of a negative feedback circuit stabilizing peak-to-peak value, 

phase and DC offset of the generated signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a waveform generator for a
deflection apparatus of a video display.To correct for E-W pincushion distortion with respect
to an electron beam that produces a green raster in a cathode ray
tube (CRT) of, for example, a projection television receiver, and to
correct for the misconvergence with respect to the electron beams
that produce the blue and red rasters, a convergence winding is
employed. The convergence winding is driven by a sawtooth
current component at a horizontal rate with an amplitude that
varies in a vertical rate parabolic manner. The waveform of the
sawtooth current component is produced in a four-quadrant
analog multiplier. The multiplier receives a vertical rate parabola
signal at a first input and a horizontal rate sawtooth signal at a
second input.During vertical blanking, the vertical rate parabola
signal is at a level that is intended to produce by the
multiplication operation, minimum peak-to-peak amplitude of the
sawtooth output signal of the multiplier.Disadvantageously, because of, for example, tolerances,
drifts and components aging, the multiplier could operate in an
imbalanced condition that is equivalent to having a DC voltage
shift or offset at the first input. Consequently, the peak-to-peak
amplitude of the output signal may not be minimal, during
vertical blanking. Such imbalanced operation may be undesirable.In one prior art arrangement, a service adjustable DC
input offset voltage has been introduced at an input of the
multiplier in a manner to compensate for the imbalanced
condition. Disadvantageously, temperature variation and
components aging may re-introduce such imbalanced condition in
the multiplier that cannot be corrected without a service
adjustment. In US-A-4,764,709 a top/bottom pincushion correction circuit is
disclosed. In this known circuit a multiplier is controlled in an open loop
fashion by varying the gain of the multiplier as a function of both horizontal
deflection amplitude and vertical deflection amplitude. The output signal is
not sampled.In WO-A-84/02227 another pincushion distortion correction
circuit is disclosed, wherein a multiplier is controlled in a
closed loop fashion. Also in this case, the multiplier's output
signal is not sampled.It may be desirable to calibrate the multiplier
periodically, for example, during each vertical blanking interval,
such that the above-mentioned imbalance is automatically
eliminated. A video display deflection apparatus, embodying an
aspect of the invention, includes a source of a
