<ABSTRACT>
An instrument for applying an orthopedic fastener activated by a 
setting pin includes a member for abutting the fastener, a member for grasping the 

setting pin, and means for moving said members relative to each other. The 
instrument may be used endosco
pically in conjunction with a cannula. An 
endoscopic drilling member is provided for deployment through the cannula to 

create a hole for emplacement of the fastener into bone or hard tissue.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an insertion tool for applying an
orthopedic fastener.Orthopedic fasteners, i.e. surgical bone fasteners, are
known. Also known are surgical fasteners for anchoring soft tissue such as
ligament or tendon to bone. Various types of soft tissue anchoring devices are
illustrated, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,454,875; 4,570,623; 4,927,421; and
4,927,421.Bone implantable devices such as those mentioned above
are typically made of metal or other hard material. More recently, bone
implantable devices have been made from bioabsorbable material, which offers the
advantage of gradual transfer of stress back to the bone as the healing proceeds.
An example of a bioabsorbable orthopedic fastener for fastening soft tissue to
bone is described in European Patent Application No. EP-A-0504915.Bioabsorbable materials are relatively soft as compared to
metals and cannot be self-drilled or impacted into bone. Generally, it is necessary
to predrill a hole into the bone and thereafter insert the orthopedic fastener. In
particular, the orthopedic fastener described in European Patent Application No.
EP-A-0504915 possesses a pin which, when pulled, biases barbed legs radially
outward to anchor the fastener securely within the hole. In US-A-5167665, which is used as
basis for the preamble of claim 1, an instrument
for applying such an orthopedic fastener is illustrated. The technical features which characterise the invention are recited
in claim 1 below.An instrument for applying a surgical fastener
activated by a setting pin is described herein. The instrument includes a fastener
abutting means, a grasping means for engaging the setting pin and means for
moving the grasping means relative to the fastener abutting means.
A cannula and drill
portion are included as part of a kit, the cannula being adapted to receive the drill
portion and the applicator.Fig. 1 is a perspective view of the cannula of a kit of the present
invention.Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the drill assembly of a kit of the
present invention.Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the fastener manipulator assembly of
the apparatus of the present invention.Fig. 4 is a perspective view of the fastener grasping means of the
fastener manipulator assembly.Fig. 5 is a perspective view of an alternative embodiment of the
fastener manipulator assembly.Fig. 6 is a perspective view of a fastener.Figs. 7 to 10 are partly sectional views illustrating the fastener
applicator of the present invention in use for implanting an orthopedic fastener.Fig.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for applying to bodily tissue, in a
bore in the tissue at a pre-selected site of

surgery, a surgical fastener with a head (61) and
legs (64) activated by a proximally movable

setting pin when the legs are in the bore in the
tissue, which apparatus comprises:


a) means for abutting the head of the
surgical fastener;
b) grasping means for engaging a proximal
end portion of the setting pin, said grasping

means being movable with respect to said fastener
abutting means; and
c) drive means for proximally moving said
grasping means relative to said fastener abutting

means; the apparatus being characterised by:
a cannula with a bore extending on an axis
between a proximal end and a distal end, the bore

of the cannula being greater than the bore in the
tissue, thereby to accommodate the head of the

fastener, and accommodating, in use of the
apparatus, the abutting means and the grasping

means with the abutting means mounted slidably in
the cannula bore whereby actuation of the drive

means from the proximal end of the cannula
applies a surgical fastener on the said axis at

the distal end of the cannula, said distal end in
use surrounding said pre-selected site, and said

distal end further including barbs (11) to assist
placement of tissue at said site.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said grasping means is
located at the distal end of said drive means.
The apparatus of claims 1 or 2, wherein said fastener
abutting means comprises an elongated tube having an

axial bore and a distal fastener abutting surface.
The apparatus of any one of the preceding claims, wherein
said drive means comprises an elongated cylindrical

member movably disposed within the axial bore of the
fastener abutting means. 
The apparatus of claims 3 and 4, wherein said drive means
includes a threaded portion for engaging a tapped portion

of the axial bore of the fastener abutting means whereby
said drive means is moved relative to the fastener

abutting means by a screw motion.
The apparatus of claims 4, 5 or 6 wherein said fastener
abutting means includes an elongated, longitudinally

oriented notch, and said drive means possesses a peg
extending into the elongated notch.
The apparatus of any of claims 2 to 7, wherein the
fastener setting pin includes a proximal relatively wider

diameter head portion and the grasping means comprises a
surface for engaging said head portion.
The apparatus of any one of the preceding claims, wherein
said fastener setting pin includes at least one notch and

the grasping means includes at least one detent
configured and dimensioned to engage said notch.
The apparatus of any one of the preceding claims wherein
the cannula possesses at least one notch at its proximal

end and the fastener abutting means possesses a proximal
end cap having at least one distal pointing projection

for engaging said at least one notch. 
A kit for endoscopically applying an orthopedic
fastener activated by a proximally movable

setting pin, said kit comprising apparatus as
claimed in any one of the preceding claims, in

combination with means for drilling into bone,
the drilling means being received, in use, within

the said cannula.
The kit of claim 10, wherein said drilling means
comprises a guide portion and a drill portion,

said drill portion including a shaft having a
drill bit at the distal end thereof, and said

guide tube portion comprising a cylindrical
member having at least two spaced apart bearing

means for supporting said drill shaft while
permitting rotary and axial movement of said

drill shaft.
The kit of claim 11 wherein said drill shaft
possesses stop means for limiting the axial

movement of the drill portion relative to the
guide portion to within a predetermined range.
The kit of claims 10, 11 or 12, and further
including a surgical fastener.
The kit of claims 10, 11, 12 or 13 wherein said
fastener is fabricated from a bioabsorbable

material.
The kit of claim 14 wherein said bioabsorbable
material is selected from polymers of glycolide,

lactide, p-dioxanone, caprolactone, and mixtures
and blends thereof.
