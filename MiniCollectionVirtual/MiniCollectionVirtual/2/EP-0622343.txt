<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with the invention, the index of refraction of a glassy 
material is increased by treating the material with hydrogen and applying heat. 

Specifically, the glass is exposed to hydrogen or deuterium at pressure in the range 
14-11,000 p.s.i. and a temperature in the range 21-150°C for a time sufficient for the 

hydrogen to diffuse into the glass. The glass is then subjected to heat in excess of 
about 500°C, as by application of a flame or infrared radiation. The duration of 

heating can be less than a second. The result is a substantial and long-lived increase 
in the normalized refractive index. For example, flame heating of H₂ loaded 

commercial GeO₂ doped optical fibers (AT
&
T Accutether single mode fiber) has 
produced normalized index changes Δn/n of 4x10⁻³. This process can be used to 

make and adjust a variety of optical waveguide devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for increasing the index of refraction
of a glassy material. It is particularly useful in the fabrication of optical devices such
as optical waveguides, gratings and lasers.It is known that in-line optical fiber gratings can be formed by applying
two interfering beams of ultraviolet radiation to a glass waveguide structure. See, for
example, United States Patents No. 4,807,950 and 4,725,110 which are incorporated
herein by reference. Typically these gratings are formed in Ge-doped optical fiber.The present applicants have discovered and disclosed in the
aforementioned parent applications that the index-changing effect of actinic (UV)
radiation can be enhanced by treating the glass with hydrogen or deuterium. See also F. Ouellette et al., Applied
PhysicsLetters, Vol. 58(17), p. 1813 which inter alia
discloses that the sensitivity of the Ge-doped fiber to
actinic radiation can be enhanced by a thermal hydrogen
treatment (4 hours at 400°C in 12 atmospheres
of H2). See also G. Meltz et al., SPIE, Vol. 1516, International
Workshop on Photoinduced Self-Organization
in Optical Fiber, May 10-11, 1991, Quebec
City, Canada, paper 1516-18, which reports
treating a heavily-doped germanosilicate preform rod
for 75 hours at 610°C in 1 atmosphere of H2 to enhance
the photosensitivity of the glass. U.S. patent
application 643,886, filed January 18, 1991 for R. M.
Atkins et al., discloses a process of manufacturing
optical fiber that enhances the GeO/GeO2 ratio in the
Ge-doped core of the fiber, thereby enhancing the
sensitivity of the fiber to actinic radiation. The process
involves, exemplarily, collapsing the preform tube in
a substantially oxygen-free atmosphere. The present application is predicated upon the further discovery that in
hydrogen or deuterium treated glass (hereinafter generically referred to as
hydrogen-treated glass), the index of refraction can be increased not only by actinic
radiation, but also by the application of heat.The index of refraction of a glassy material is increased by treating the
material with hydrogen and applying heat. Specifically, the glass is exposed to
hydrogen or deuterium at pressure in the range
96.5 kPa - 75.8 MPa
(14-11,000 p.s.i.) and a temperature in
the range 21-150°C for a time sufficient for the hydrogen to diffuse into the glass.
The glass is then subjected to heat in excess of about 500°C, as by application of a
flame or infrared radiation. The duration of heating is preferably a second or less.
The result is a substantial and
