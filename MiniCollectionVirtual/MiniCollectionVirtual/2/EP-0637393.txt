<ABSTRACT>
In an optical projection system for use in projection printing of masks to wafers, comprising an illumination system including a light source and a mask positioned in the optical path of the illumination system, an optical phase structure is positioned in the optical path between the light source and the mask. The phase structure comprises a pattern of distributed transparent features having at least one refractive index, the transparent features of said phase structure being related in position and orientation to the opaque features of the mask.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to projection
photolithography techniques and more particularly to an optical mask according to the preamble of claim 1 with a
novel resolution-enhancing optical phase structure to
be used in a projection illumination system, as employed
for instance in the fabrication of integrated semiconductor
components.Projection photolithography techniques are used for the
production of photoresists intended for use in the fabrication
of large scale integration components. For
this purpose, a mask has to be projection printed to a
photoresist-covered semiconductor wafer using an
optical projection system. The heart of the optical
projection system is a projection lens which reduces
the pattern contained in the mask onto the resist layer
on the semiconductor substrate. The high optical
quality of the projection lens makes it possible to
obtain the theoretical critical resolution for a narrow
monochromatic spectral range.A conventional transmission mask consists of a glass
substrate covered with an opaque chromium layer with
apertures to define the desired intensity pattern. The 
aperture pattern contains the spectrum information of
the device geometries to be imaged on the wafer surface.
The laws of diffraction cause the light intensity
to spread into the dark regions surrounding the light
beam. Constructive interference between the light
fields diffracted by the apertures in the mask
maximizes the intensity between the apertures, thus
reducing the resolution of the projection system.An improvement in resolution and contrast is highly
valuable in advanced photolithography in order to meet
the requirements of reduction in the lateral dimensions
and minimum size of the pattern features of microelectronic
devices. An improved resolution can be
achieved by using a phase-shifting technique which
needs so-called phase-shifting masks. The phase-shifting
mask differs from the conventional transmission
mask in that at least one transparent phase-shifting
layer covers adjacent apertures. For instance,
EP-A-0524741 and EP-A-0462560 disclose using two
transparent phase-shifting layers on top of the mask.
The optical waves transmitted through adjacent
apertures then follow different phases. If it is
arranged that the emerging waves are 180Â° out-of-phase
with one another, destructive interference minimizes
the light intensity between their images at the wafer
surface, thus resulting in an improved resolution and
contrast. However, phase-shifting masks are costly and
difficult to
