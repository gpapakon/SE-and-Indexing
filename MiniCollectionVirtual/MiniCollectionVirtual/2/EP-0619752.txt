<ABSTRACT>
A chamber (76) for use in a rotating field to separate blood components. An inlet port (68) near one end of the chamber introduces blood into the chamber (76) for flow circumferentially about the rotational axis toward the opposite end of the chamber (76) for separation into at least one blood component. At least one outlet port (72) is juxtaposed next to the inlet port (68) near the one end of the chamber (76) for conveying one separated blood component from the channel. The chamber (76) directs the one separated blood component to a collection region (124) near the opposite end of the chamber (76). An enclosed interior collection passage (126) within the channel leads from the collection region (124) and directs the one collected component to the outlet port (70) for transport from the chamber (76).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to centrifugal processing systems and
apparatus.Today blood collection organizations routinely separate whole
blood by centrifugation into its various therapeutic components, such as
red blood cells, platelets, and plasma.Conventional blood processing systems and methods use durable
centrifuge equipment in association with single use, sterile processing
chambers, typically made of plastic. The centrifuge equipment introduces
whole blood into these chambers while rotating them to create a
centrifugal field.Whole blood separates within the rotating chamber under the
influence of the centrifugal field into higher density red blood cells and
platelet-rich plasma. An intermediate layer of white blood cells and
lymphocytes forms an interface between the red blood cells and platelet-rich
plasma.Conventional blood processing methods use durable centrifuge
equipment in association with single use, sterile processing systems,
typically made of plastic. The operator loads the disposable systems upon
the centrifuge before processing and removes them afterwards. Conventional centrifuges often do not permit easy access to the
areas where the disposable systems reside during use. As a result, loading
and unloading operations can be time consuming and tedious.Disposable systems are often preformed into desired shapes to
simplify the loading and unloading process. However, this approach is
often counterproductive, as it increases the cost of the disposables.The invention provides improved blood processing chambers as in
Claims 1 and 2, which create unique dynamic flow conditions and are
compact and easily handled.One aspect of the invention provides a chamber for use in a rotating
field to separate blood components. The chamber includes a separation
channel having a low-G side wall radially spaced from the rotational axis,
a high-G side wall radially spaced apart circumferentially about the
rotation axis. An inlet port near the first end wall introduces blood into
the channel for flow circumferentially about the rotational axis from the
first end wall toward the second end wall for separation into two blood
components.In this aspect of the invention, the outlet ports are juxtaposed next
to the inlet port near the first end wall for conveying the separated blood
components from the channel. In this way, the fluid flow tubing
associated with the chamber is located within a single compact region of
the chamber. This simplifies handling of the chamber, particularly when
loading and unloading the
