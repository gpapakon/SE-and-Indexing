<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel, fiber-reactive urea linkage-containing 
alkoxypolyoxyalkylene fluorocarbamates and their use to provide 
durable oil-repellency, durable soil-repellency and durable soil-release properties 
to textiles, and to novel processes for preparing the fiber-reactive fluorocarbamates. The treatment or modification of fabrics to improve their properties 
is routine practice in the textile industry. For instance, thermosetting organic resins 
are often used to impart "wash and wear" or "permanent press" characteristics to 
such fabrics as cotton, cotton polyester blends and other cellulosic blends which 
naturally wrinkle badly when cleaned or laundered. Various modifying additives or 
finishing agents such as softeners, stiffeners, lubricants, etc., are also commonly 
employed with the resin to provide a suitable commercial fabric. These 
treatments/modifications typically increase the oleophilicity of the fabric, thereby 
significantly increasing its tendency to accept oily stains and reducing its ability to 
release such stains after laundering. The resin treated/modified fabrics can be co-treated with hydrophilic 
materials to reduce their oleophilicity and facilitate stain release during laundering. 
These materials, which are referred to as soil release agents, can be hydrophilic 
colloids such as carboxymethylcellulose, synthetic hydrophilic polymers such as 
polyacrylic acid, or fluorochemical-based systems. The latter, which may comprise 
physical mixtures of a fluorinated oil/water repellent and a non-fluorinated 
hydrophilic derivative or chemical hybrids containing both fluorinated oleophobic 
and non-fluorinated hydrophilic segments, are particularly advantageous, since they 
provide oil repellency during normal wear and inhibit "wicking" or diffusion of oily 
soils into the fabric or fiber bundles, as well as facilitate soil release during 
laundering. The prior art fluorinated soil release products typically have one 
or more of the following disadvantages: 
   They are prepared by multi-step, less-than-quantitative yield procedures 
which require the isolation and purification of one or more intermediate 
reaction products, and/or are utilized as solutions in organic solvents which 
are toxic, flammable and/or expensive or as surfactant stabilized emulsions or  
 
dispersions which tend not to be freeze/thaw or shear stable, or which have poor 
compatibility and stability with textile mill finish baths and/or are not overly wash 
durable when applied to
