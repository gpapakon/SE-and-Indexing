<ABSTRACT>
It is accepted that it is not possible to achieve conscious control of all the dynamics of a golf swing. It is accepted that success is dictated by a combination of adherence to the recognised fundamentals and a focus so specific as to ensure compliance with said fundamentals which precludes all conscious attempts at control. This invention provides such a focus by means of a head-position indicator which ensures correct body positioning throughout, use of which requires a degree of concentration such as to preclude said conscious control. The device trains a golfer to maintain the correct position throughout, develop a smooth swing through the ball and provides visual feedback indicating the degree of success achieved. The device has the benefit of ensuring that the club is swung on the correct path during the initial stage of the backswing, by means of an indicator triggered by such correct movement. The head position indicator (5) is located on the surface of a base piece (1) adjacent a ball locating depression (4), said indicator (5) being visible only when the user's head is in and remains in the correct position until the appropriate interval after the ball has been struck, at which point said indicator(s), consisting of a narrow beam of light, changes in colour to indicate to the user that he is free to move his head.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTRONIC GOLF PRACTICE DEVICETHE INVENTION RELATES TO A GOLF PRACTICE DEVICE WHICH ACTIVELY PROMOTES ADHERENCE TO THE RECOGNISED FUNDAMENTALS OF THE GAME AND TRAINS THE PLAYER TO DEVELOP THE HIGH DEGREE OF CONCENTRATION,OR FOCUS, NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PERFORM TO THE MAXIMUM OF HIS POTENTIAL, IN THIS EMBODIMENT, THE DEVICE REFERS TO THE ACT OF PUTTING, WHICH ACT IS NOT INFLUENCED BY THE LEVEL OF ATHLETICISM OF THE PARTICIPANT BUT RATHER BY HIS ADHERENCE TO THE FUNDAMENTALS, COUPLED WITH THE ATTAINMENT OF A LEVEL OF CONCENTRATION SUCH AS TO PRECLUDE ANY CONSCIOUS THOUGHT NOT RELATED TO THE ACT IN HAND E.G., THE CONSEQUENCES OF MISSING, MEMORIES OF PAST FAILURES, ETC. 10MOST SHORT PUTTS - OF TWO METRES OR LESS, ARE MISSED, EITHER BECAUSE THE PLAYER DOES NOT CONFORM TO RECOGNISED FUNDAMENTALS OR BECAUSE HE IS NOT FOCUSED ON THE TASK, TO THE EXCULSION OF ALL IRRELEVANCIES, RATHER THAN BECAUSE OF ANY LACK OF CAPALILITY.IT IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED BY GOLFERS THAT A GOOD SWING IS THE 15 RESULT OF THE SUCCESSFUL MERGING OF TWO DISTINCT PHASES, WHICH ARE (i) THE STATIC PHASE AND (ii) THE DYNAMIC PHASE. IN ORDER TO DEVELOP A COMPETENT SWING, THERE ARE FUNDAMENTALS WHICH MUST BE APPLIED TO EACH PHASE.THE STATIC PHASE OF THE SWING, I.E., GRIP, SET-UP, STANCE, 20POSTURE CAN BE LEARNED AND MASTERED. THIS AREA IS ALREADY WELL PROVIDED FOR BY BOOKS, VIDEOS, PRACTICE DEVICES ETC. HOWEVER, UNLESS THE PLAYER ADOPTS A SET-UP POSITION SUCH AS TO PLACE HIS EYES DIRECTLY OVER THE INTENDED LINE OF PUTT HE WILL NOT HAVE THE CORRECT PERSPECTIVE TO JUDGE THE SHOT ACCURATELY. THE INVENTION SETS THE PLAYER IN THIS 25 POSITION AND THE DEVICE CAN NOT BE PROPERLY USED UNTIL THIS POSITION IS ADOPTED.THE DYNAMIC PHASE OF THE SWING-THE ACTUAL SWINGING OF THE CLUB - IS GOVERNED BY SO MANY VARIABLES E.G., HEIGHT, BUILD, ATHLETICISM ETC. 

 THAT NO TWO SWINGS CAN BE THE SAME. FURTHER, THE NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY OF THE VARIOUS MOVEMENTS REQUIRED TO EXECUTE THE SWING ARE SUCH THAT THEY CANNOT BE SUCCESSFULLY CONTROLLED OR EXECUTED BY THE CONSCIOUS PART OF THE BRAIN. THESE MOVEMENTS, AS IS THE CASE WITH ALL PHYSICAL ACTS, CAN AND MUST BE CONTROLLED BY THE SUB-CONSCIOUS. 5THIS INVENTION IDENTIFIES THE NEED FOR, AND PROVIDES THE USER WITH, A FOCUS SO SPECIFIC AS TO PRECLUDE ALL 'CONSCIOUS1 CONTROL WHILST ENSURING THAT HE COMPLY WITH THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE DYNAMIC PHASE, WHICH ARE(i) A FIXED (STEADY) HEAD POSITION MAINTAINED THROUGH, 10AND BEYOND, CONTACT WITH THE BALL, (ii) MINIMUM LATERAL MOVEMENT OF THE BODY AROUND THEAXIS ESTABLISHED BY THE

CLAIMS :
1. A GOLF PRACTICE DEVICE FOR TRAINING A GOLFER TO DEVELOP
THE DEGREE OF CONCENTRATION NECESSARY FOR SUCCESSFUL PUTTING AND
FOR PROVIDING THE USER WITH THE VISUAL FEEDBACK NECESSARY IN ORDER
TO TRAIN HIM TO COMPLY WITH THE RECOGNISED FUNDAMENTALS OF PUTTING,
WHICH ARE: 5
(i) A FIXED (STEADY) HEAD POSITION MAINTAINED THROUGH, AND BEYOND, CONTACT WITH THE BALL.
(ii) MINIMUM LATERAL MOVEMENT OF THE BODY AROUND THE AXIS ESTABLISHED BY THE FIXED HEAD POSITION.
(iii) A SMOOTH FREE SWING, THROUGH THE BALL, RATHER THAN 10 A HIT AT THE BALL.
(iv) A PUTTER-HEAD MAINTAINED CLOSE TO AND PARALLEL TO THE GROUND FOR A DISTANCE DETERMINED BY COMPLIANCE WITH (i) ABOVE.
SAID DEVICE COMPRISING A BASE PIECE (1) FOR POSITIONING ON THE 15
GROUND AT A LOCUS APPROPRIATE TO THE USERS FEET, A BALL POSITION LOCATING DEPRESSION (4) LOCATED ON THE SURFACE IN ORDER TO ACCURATELY POSITION THE BALL IN RELATION TO A HEAD POSITION INDICATOR (5) ALSO LOCATED ON THE SURFACE, SAID INDICATOR BEING VISIBLE ONLY WHEN THE USER'S HEAD IS IN AND REMAINS IN THE CORRECT POSITION THROUGHOUT THE 20 STROKE UNTIL THE APPROPRIATE INTERVAL AFTER THE BALL HAS BEEN STRUCK, AT WHICH POINT SAID INDICATOR, CONSISTING OF A NARROW BEAM OF LIGHT, VISIBLE ONLY WHEN THE CORRECT POSITION IS ADOPTED AND MAINTAINED CHANGES IN COLOUR TO INDICATE TO THE USER THAT HE IS FREE TO MOVE HIS HEAD, AND MEANS FOR DETERMINING THAT THE PUTTER HAS BEEN MAINTAINED 25 CLOSE TO THE SURFACE AT THE INITIAL STAGE OF THE BACKSWING CONSISTING 


 OF A CAPTIVE ROLLER ROLLER (8) PROTRUDING ABOVE THE SURFACE WHICH WHEN TOUCHED ROLLS INTO A SLOT (9) LOCATED ON THE TAPERED EDGE (2) BELOW THE FLAT SURFACE, THEREBY, ENSURING NON-INTERFERENCE WITH THE FORWARD SWING
AND AN INFRA-RED EMITTOR-DETECTOR (10) LOCATED ON THE RAISED POD. 5 (3) TO DETECT THE PRESENCE OF A BALL OR PUTTER FOLLOWED BY IT'S
ABSENCE, WHICH ABSENCE TRIGGERS THE CHANGE IN COLOUR OF THE HEAD
POSITION INDICATOR.
2. A DEVICE AS CLAIMED IN CLAIM 1 WHEREIN THE MEANS TO DETECT
THE PRESENCE OF THE BALL AND CLUB, FOLLOWED BY THEIR ABSENCE IS BY 10 MECHANICAL OR PRESSURE SWITCH MEANS.
3. A DEVICE AS CLAIMED IN 1 AND 2 WHEREIN THE HEAD POSITION INDICATOR IS IN THE FORM OF A THREE-DIMENSIONAL FITTING ON OR BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE DEVICE.
4. A DEVICE AS CLAIMED IN CLAIMS 1, 2 AND 3 WHEREIN THE MEANS FOR DETERMINING THAT THE CLUB HEAD HAS BEEN MAINTAINED CLOSE TO THE SURFACE IS IN THE FORM OF EITHER INFRA-RED OR PHOTOELECTRIC DETECTION.
5. A DEVICE AS CLAIMED IN CLAIMS 1-4 WHEREBY THE MEANS TO INDICATE THAT THE PLAYER IS FREE TO MOVE HIS HEAD IS BY USE OF AN AUDIBLE SIGNAL. 20
6. A GOLF PRACTICE DEVICE FOR TRAINING A GOLFER TO DEVELOP THE DEGREE OF CONCENTRATION NECESSARY FOR SUCCESSFUL GOLF AND FOR PROVIDING THE USER WITH THE VISUAL FEEDBACK NECESSARY IN ORDER TO TRAIN HIM TO COMPLY WITH THE RECOGNISED FUNDAMENTALS OF A GOOD SWING WHICH ARE: 25
(i) A STEADY HEAD POSITION,* WITH THE MINIMUM LATERAL MOVEMENT COMMENSURATE WITH THE MORE DYNAMIC FULL SWING, MAINTAINED THROUGH AND BEYOND CONTACT WITH THE BALL.
(ii) A SMOOTH SWING, THROUGH, NOT AT THE BALL. 30
SAID DEVICE COMPRISING A BASE PIECE FOR POSITIONING ON THE GROUND AT A LOCUS APPROPRIATE TO THE CLUB BEING USED SUCH THAT THE VISUAL HEAD INDICATOR IS VISIBLE TO USER WHEN HE ADOPTS HIS STANCE APPROPRIATE TO THE CLUB BEING USED AND IS ADJUSTED SO THAT IT REMAINS VISIBLE, WITH 


A LIMITED LATERAL MOVEMENT OF THE USER'S HEAD OR BODY, SAID VISUAL HEAD INDICATOR BEING IN THE FORM OF A NARROW BEAM OF LIGHT, VISIBLE THROUGH AN APERTURE ON THE SURFACE OF THE DEVICE, WITH AN INFRA-RED EMITTOR-DETECTOR LOCATED ON DEVICE SUCH AS TO LOCATE THE POSITION OF THE BALL OR CLUB FOLLOWED BY THEIR ABSENCE, WHEN BALL AND/OR 5 CLUB ARE PLACED IN PROXIMITY TO RATHER THAN ON THE DEVICE AND A MEANS OF INDICATING TO THE USER THAT HE IS FREE TO MOVE HIS HEAD, SAID MEANS BEING A CHANGE IN COLOUR OF THE HEAD POSITION INDICATOR.
