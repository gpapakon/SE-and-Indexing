A circuit configuration for a brake system with 
anti-lock control and/or traction slip control,
 
comprising circuits for conditioning sensor signals 

representative of the rotational behaviour of the individual 
vehicle wheels, controller circuits for analyzing 

and processing the conditioned sensor signals and 
for generating braking pressure control signals that 

drive solenoid valves inserted into the pressure fluid 
conduits of the brake system,
 
comprising monitoring circuits to which the conditioned 

sensor signals can be supplied and which, in case of a 
malfunction, de-activate or disconnect the control in 

part or completely, and which include circuits (7) for 
the speed conditioning, circuits (11) for generating 

signals derived from the wheel speed, such as deceleration 
signals and acceleration signals, jerk signals and 

reference signals,
 
and circuits for exchanging and comparing signals of the 

controller circuits with corresponding signals of the 
monitoring circuits,
characterized
 in that the monitoring circuits 
(3) include control algorithm reproduction circuits 

(14) for the simplified reproduction of the control 
algorithms, in particular for the determination of 

the control phases, which result when the derived signals 
are analyzed according to the algorithms of the 

controller circuits (2), and circuits (15) for the correlation 
of the output signals of the control algorithm 

reproduction circuits (14) with the braking pressure 
control signals. 
A circuit configuration as claimed in claim 1, 

characterized
 in that the controller circuits 
(2) and the associated circuits for the speed  

 
conditioning are part of a control microcontroller 

(RMC), and the monitoring circuits (3) are part of a 
monitoring microcontroller (ÜMC), and in that the monitoring 

microcontroller (ÜMC) has a simplified structure 
in comparison with the control microcontroller (RMC). 
A circuit configuration as claimed in claim 2, 

characterized
 in that a 16-bit high-performance 
microcontroller is provided as a control microcontroller 

(RMC), and an 8-bit microcontroller is provided 
as a monitoring microcontroller (ÜMC). 
A circuit configuration as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3, 

characterized
 in that the circuits for exchanging 
and comparing (8, 8', 9, 9') signals of the 

control microcontroller (RMC) with the corresponding 
signals of the monitoring microcontroller (ÜMC) and the 

circuits (15) for the correlation of the valve-excitation 
signals with the signals of the reproduction circuits 

(14) are integral components of the control microcontroller 
(RMC) and the monitoring microcontroller 

(ÜMC).
