<ABSTRACT>
A radio system, in particular a mobile radio system (MRS), is proposed which has radio interfaces (COMa) with modifiable parameters (Ta, Fa) which are defined and modified by the fixed radio station BS. The parameters are calculated in the fixed radio station on the basis of the required transmission capacity (CAPr) of a distant radio station (MSa) and on the basis of a calculation of free transmission capacity (CAPI) within a pre-defined frequency range. The parameters (Ta, Fa) are defined in order to set the transceivers in the fixed radio station and in the distant radio station in such a way that the required transmission capacity takes up the minimum amount of free transmission capacity. Efficient use is made of the frequency spectrum, with radio transmission being matched continuously to the capacity requirements of the mobile stations.
