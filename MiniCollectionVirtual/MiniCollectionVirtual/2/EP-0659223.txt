<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a pressing arrangement for a moving web (w). The arrangement comprises a cylindrical roll (4) forming a press zone with a glide-belt (6) which is at least partially and slidingly supported by a shoe (8) having a contour of alterable convexity along the press zone surface so as to alter the length of the press zone (26). Supply mechanisms (10, 12) are provided to supply lubricant for a lubricating film between the glide belt and the shoe. The shoe (8) can be supported by a counter roll (14) situated on the opposite side of the shoe relative the press roll (4) and have a concave surface mating the counter roll thus enabling adjustment of the shoe (8) around the centerline of the counter roll. In an alternative arrangement a desired press zone length could be obtained by installing a removable insert (15) having a proper contour in the press zone area of the shoe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a pressing or surface
finishing arrangement according to the introductory parts of claims 1, 3 and 5.In prior art, a press arrangement is known from WO, A1, 9213134
wherein a shoe is under
applied pressure via a glide-belt between a press roll and a
counter roll, the shoe having a concave form following the
contour of the press roll on the press roll side and a non-concave
contour on the counter roll side and the shoe being
adjustable around the centerline of the press roll so as to
vary the pressure distribution in the contact zone with the
press roll. The pressure zone on the counter roll side is
however, not adjustable in any defined manner.Further in prior art, a press arrangement is known from
US, A, 4 287 021 wherein a non-adjustable concave
shoe is used to form a pressure zone with a press roll.Examples of the general technical stand are also divulged
from EP, A2, 007 0869 and EP, A2, 0 389 458.One main purpose with the present invention is to
achieve a pressing arrangement of the general type indicated
in the introductory parts as stated above, having the features
as defined in the characterizing parts of the claims. Thus the convexity
of the shoe
along its pressing surface can be adjusted so as to always
obtain a desired length of the pressing zone in the contact 
area with the press roll. This length is a function of the
radius of the shoe in the contact area and can thus be altered
by altering the degree of convexity of the shoe. By
suitably pivoting the shoe in the present invention it can
be adjusted to achieve a desired contour and length of press
zone. The contour of the shoe in this area could suitably
be spiral. Alternatively, a desired contour could be obtained
by installing a removable insert in the press zone
of the shoe. In practice the length of the press zone can
be varied between approximately 1 and 6 centimeters when
using a relatively hard press roll and more with a softer
roll. Besides finding use in press applications for removing
water from a web, the present invention can be suitably
applied in the smoothing of paper for improving the surface
finish of the web. In the latter application the press roll
is often heated to improve the web surface and thus in a preferred
embodiment of the invention a counter roll on the opposite
side of the shoe in relation to the press roll is used
to lead off heat from the system via a concave pressure zone
between the shoe and the counter roll.The invention shall now be elucidated in the following
with

<CLAIMS>
Pressing arrangement for a moving web (w)
comprising a press zone (26) receiving the moving web

(w), the press zone (26) being formed between a
cylindrical press roll (4) and a glide-belt (6) enclosing

a shoe (8), which at least partly and slidingly supports
the glide-belt (6), said shoe (8) being itself supported

by a counter roll (14), which is situated on the opposite
side of the shoe (8) relative to the press roll (4), and

said shoe (8) being adjustably mounted in order to bring
a desired section of the side of the shoe (8) facing the

press roll (4) into pressing contact with the press roll
(4) via the glide-belt (6), the pressing arrangement

further comprising lubricant supply mechanisms (10, 12)
to form a lubricating film between the glide-belt (6) and

the shoe (8), 
characterized
 in that the side
of the shoe (8) facing the press roll (4) has a contour

in the direction of movement of the web (w) which is
convex and of varying convexity, so that, by adjusting

the position of the shoe (8), the convexity of the shoe
(8) in the area of the press zone (26), and thereby the

length of the press zone (26), can be altered.
Pressing arrangement according to claim 1,

characterized
 in that the side of the shoe
(8) facing the counter roll (14) has a contour in the

direction of movement of the web (w) which is concave and
mating the surface of the counter roll (14) in the

support area, and that the shoe (8) is adjustably mounted
around the centerline of the counter roll (14).
Pressing arrangement for a moving web (w)
comprising a press zone (26) receiving the moving web

(w), the press zone (26) being formed between a
cylindrical press roll (4) and an endless glide-belt (6)

which is slidingly supported by a shoe (8) in the area of
the press zone (26), said shoe (8) being adjustably

mounted in order to bring a desired section of the side 
of the shoe (8) facing the press roll (4) into pressing

contact with the press roll (4) via the glide-belt (6),
the pressing arrangement further comprising lubricant

supply mechanisms (10, 12) to form a lubricating film
between the glide-belt (6) and the shoe (8), 
characterized

in that the shoe (8) is supported by a
beam (28), which is situated on the opposite side of the

shoe (8) relative to the press roll (4), and the side of
the shoe (8) facing the press roll (4) has a contour in

the direction of movement of the web (w) which is convex
and of varying convexity, so that, by adjusting the

position of the shoe (8), the convexity of the shoe (8)
in the area of the press zone (26), and thereby the

length of the press zone (26), can be altered.
Pressing arrangement according to any of the
preceding claims, 
characterized
 in that said
contour of the side of the shoe (8) facing the press roll

(4) has a spiral form.
Pressing arrangement for a moving web (w)
