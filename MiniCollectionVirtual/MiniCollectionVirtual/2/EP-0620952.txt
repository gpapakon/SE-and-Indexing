<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a high power-to-weight electromotive 
device capable of use as a motor, alternator or generator. 
Electromotive devices are known for use both in transforming 
electrical energy into mechanical power and transforming mechanical 
power into electrical energy. In both cases, the energy or power 
producing capability results from relative movement between a 
magnetic field and electrically conductive elements. Lightweight motor, alternator and generator devices are well 
known and some are capable of operation at high speeds. However, 
many such devices are not capable of producing high power at high 
speeds. For example, high power density devices of 9.86 x 102W/kg 
(0.6 horsepower per pound of weight) are known to be useful for 
periods of intermittent operation, but such devices are incapable 
of continuous operation at high power densities in excess of 
1.64 x 103W/kg (1 horsepower per pound). Also prior high power 
electromotive devices have not been capable of simultaneous high 
speed and high torque operation, nor have they provided efficiency 
of operation. Many of the problems associated with achieving a high power-to-weight 
ratio electromotive device have been addressed by United 
States Patent No. 4,900,965. The '965 patent discloses an 
electromotive device with a high power density per unit weight 
effected by utilization of an armature assembly having a large  
 
diameter-fin cross section speculation ratio. This structure of the 
'965 patent results in low opposing induced currents, as well as low 
eddy currents, to enable operation of the electromotive device at high 
efficiency with maintainable high torque during high speed operation. The '965 patent provides for minimal hysteresis or eddy current 
losses by providing a flux path through stationery iron. This design 
led to an improvement over conventional motors which suffer such 
eddy current losses due to the fact that the iron through which the 
flux path travels is moving. Since the torque of the motor is 
proportional to the flux, any reduction in the flux will result in 
decreased torque. In a typical electric motor, the torque will fall off 
rapidly with increasing speed. The eddy current losses in the copper 
conductors and armature bars are associated with the windings or 
copper and are caused by cross leakage between the bars (made 
worse by radially long bars) and direct exposure of the copper to the 
magnetic field, and over saturation of the armature bars due to an 
excess amount of permanent
