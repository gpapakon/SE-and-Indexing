<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a seal in the gap between the border of a building opening (1) and the rear of a vehicle, having two vertical strips (4) located on both sides of the building opening (1), and having a transverse part (3) before the upper ends of the two strips (4), the transverse part (3) being suspended on a transverse load-bearing member (5), from which a roof tarpaulin (7) extends to the building, and the two strips (4) being fastened at the front on a load-bearing body (10) which produces a connection between the lateral borders of the vertical strips (4) and the building (2), and, finally, the roof tarpaulin (7) being provided at both ends with an overhang (8) which hangs down freely and covers over the upper end of the load-bearing body (10). In order to ensure sealing in the upper part of the seal (3', 13) and to simplify the task of mounting the seal, the invention makes provision for the releasable connection (15) of the overhangs (8) to the laterally outwardly located borders of the transverse part (3).

Deformable seal for sealing the gap between the
edge of a building opening (1) and the rear of a vehicle

being positioned thereat, having a soft, deformable
apron formed from two vertical strips (4), which are

disposed on both sides of the building opening (1), and
a transverse member (3), which is situated in the upper

strip region in front of the strips (4) and is mounted
on a cross-piece member (5), from which a top cover (7)

extends towards the building, the two vertical strips
(4) being secured at their front end on a supporting

body (10) with a lateral covering (11) serving as the
connection between the lateral edges of the strips (4)

and the building, the supporting body (10) being
elastically resiliently deformable towards the building

independently of the top cover (7) and the transverse
member (3) and, moreover, the top cover (7) being

provided at both ends with a freely suspended overhang
(8), which covers the upper end of the supporting body

(10) or respectively of the covering (11), characterised
in that the front edges (13) of the overhangs (8),

remote from the building, are detachably, but
weather-resistantly, connected to the lateral edges (3')

of the transverse member (3), the edges (3', 13) being
provided with one or more deformable lugs (14), which

are formed from film or fabric, for example, and
detachably abut against the part (3, 8) to be connected

in a vertically protruding manner.
Seal according to claim 1, characterised in that
the lugs (14) abut against the internal surface of the

part (3, 8) to be connected. 
Seal according to claim 1, characterised in that
the connecting means (15) are situated in the end region

of the lugs.
Seal according to claim 1, characterised in
that the transverse member (3) is provided at its ends

with one or more slots (16), which are open towards the
lower edge.
