<DESCRIPTION>
 LUBRICATING OIL FOR INHIBITING RUST FORMATIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThis invention concerns the use of a particular rust inhibi¬ tor to inhibit rust formation in lubricating oils formulated from highly saturated base oils.2. Description of Related ArtMany lubricating oils require the presence of rust inhibitors to inhibit or prevent rust formation, which often occurs due to water contacting a metal surface. Until now, the industry has assumed that all commercially available rust inhibitors are capable of protecting a metal surface from water. However, rust inhibitors presently available in the marketplace were developed for conventionally processed base- stocks that contain significant amounts of aromatic and polar compounds and relatively small amounts of saturates.Surprisingly, we have found that most commercially available rust inhibitors are ineffective in preventing rust in lubricating oils formulated from highly saturated basestocks.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn one embodiment, this invention concerns a lubricating oil capable of inhibiting rust formation which comprises:(a) a lubricating oil basestock having an average ring number per mole of less than 1.5, and(b) an oil soluble rust inhibitor capable of reducing the interfacial tension between the oil and water in the oil to from about 1 to about 4 mN/m. 

 In another embodiment, this invention concerns a method for inhibiting rust formation in an internal combustion engine by lubricating the engine with the oil described above.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThis invention requires a major amount of a particular lubricating oil basestock and a minor amount of a particular oil soluble rust inhibitor.The lubricating oil basestocks used in this invention must have an average ring number per mole of less than 1.5. Such basestocks are usually "highly saturated" in that they contain at least about 95 wt.%, most preferably at least 98 wt.%, saturates (i.e. less than 2 wt.% aromatic and polar compounds). These basestocks include slack wax isomerates and polyalphaolefins. Preferably, the average ring number per mole should be less than 1, more preferably less than about 0.5, and most preferably 0.3 or less.Slack wax is the oily wax from dewaxing conventional hydro¬ carbon oils. By slack wax isomerate is meant the lubes fraction that remains following dewaxing the isomerate formed from isomerizing slack wax in the presence of a suitable catalyst under isomerization condi¬ tions.Isomerization is conducted over a catalyst
