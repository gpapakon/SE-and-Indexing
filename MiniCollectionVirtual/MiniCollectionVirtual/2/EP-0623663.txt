<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for fluidifying aqueous drilling
muds which are constituted by an aqueous dispersion of
clays containing, as the dispersant agent, a complex
selected from particular zirconium complexes, and to the
use of said complexes as fluidifier agents for
aqueous drilling muds.The aqueous drilling muds are often constituted
by aqueous suspensions of clays, in particular
bentonite, fluidified with dispersant agents or
fluidifiers, for the purposes of preventing that
during the drilling operations excessive increases
occur in viscosity, yield stress and gel strength. The
above said aqueous muds can possibly contain also
other types of additives, with the most widely used of
them being filtrate reducer agents and thickening
agents.By "dispersant agents (or fluidifier agents)", those
substances are meant which are capable of reducing the
viscosity of the mud, both initially and during the
use thereof.Among those causes which may cause an increase in
viscosity, the high-temperature hydration of
bentonite, an increase in suspended solid matter
concentration, the coagulation caused by entering
metal ions or salts, the degradation of other organic
derivatives contained in the mud, can be cited.Among the main fluidifier agents for muds,
lignosulfonates fall, which are byproducts deriving
from the sulfite process for separating the cellulosic 
from the ligninic portion of wood.The effectiveness of these fluidifiers at high
temperatures can be improved in the presence of such
metals, as chromium, zinc or titanium, as disclosed in
US-A-2,953,473. In any cases, also the above said
lignosulfonates lose their fluidifier properties at
approximately 120-140°C. The properties of the system
can be restored, or, at minimum, this degradation
process can be delayed by means of the addition of
sodium chromate.Other fluidifiers, more suitable for high-temperature
processes, are lignites, a material of
fossile nature mainly constituted by humic acids,
which are water soluble in their salified form.
Lignites can be used as sodium or potassium salts, or
they can be simply admixed with chromium (US-A-3,766,229).The prior art supplies a range of indications in
order to improve the dispersant properties of
lignites, for example, by means of the reaction with
chromium-(VI) salts, at 80°C, as disclosed in US-A-3,956,142,
or with such trivalent chromium salts, such
as CrCl3.6H2O, Cr(CH3COO)3.The lignitic or ligninic products can be further
modified or replaced by sulfoalkylated tannins. The
latter, the
