<ABSTRACT>
A test-strip analysis system consisting of an evaluation device having a test-strip holder (3) and suitable test strips. The test-strip holder (3) is used for positioning the test strip (4) in a defined position with respect to a measuring unit (11). It has a test-strip support (20) and a guide for the test strip. Exact positioning with simple manipulation and with low constructional complexity is achieved in that at least a part of the test-strip support (20) is designed as a prop (24) in the region in which the leading section (12) of the test strip introduced first into the device is located in the measurement position, which prop is shifted in height with respect to the mid-plane (22) of the test-field region (13), with the test-strip holder (3) at the same time having a pressure element (33) which, in the measurement position between the prop (24) and the test-field region (13) of the test strip (4), presses the latter against the side (34) lying opposite the support (20). The test strip (4) is thereby placed under bending stress, which establishes the defined separation of the at least one test field (6) from the measurement unit (11).

Test strip analysis system, comprising

an analysis apparatus (2) with a test strip holder
(3) for positioning a test strip (4) in a defined

measuring position relative to a measuring unit (11),
and
test strips (4) having a base layer (5), a front end
(10), a handling end (16), a test field area (13)

with at least one test field (6) between the handling
end (16) and the front end (10), a front section (12)

between the test field area (13) and the front end
(10) and a handling section (15) between the test

field area (13) and the handling end (16),
in which said test strip holder (3) comprises
a guide (40) for laterally guiding a test strip (4)
when it is inserted into the test strip holder (3),
a fixing element (25) which in the measuring position
is in engagement with a recess (17) in the test strip

(4), and
a test strip seat (20) on which a first side of the
test strip (4) rests in such a way that its test

field area (13) is at a defined distance from the
measuring unit (11),

characterised in that

the test strip holder (3) comprises, a support for
supporting the front section (12) of a test strip (4)

which is in the measurement position, said support 
being vertically offset in a direction extending away

from the test strip seat (20) relative to the
geometric plane (22) passing in the test field area

through the middle of the base layer (5), and a
pressure element (33) which in the measuring position

presses against the second side (34) of the test
strip (4) at a position which is located between the

support (24) and the test field area (13),
so that the test strip (4) is in the measuring
position subjected to bending stress, whereby the

defined distance of the at least one test field (6)
from the measuring unit (11) is ensured.
Test strip analysis system according to claim 1,

characterised in that the fixing element (25) and the
support (24) are simultaneously formed by a

stationary retaining element (26, 50) having a
lateral surface (27, 53) which is inclined towards

the test strip surface and on which at least a
section (28) of the edge of the recess (17) in the

test strip (4) rests.
Test strip analysis system according to claim 2,
characterised in that the recess (17) in the test

strip (4) rests on the lateral surface (53) of the
retaining element (50) in such a way that the test

strip (4) is fixed against movements both in the
direction towards its handling end (16) and in the

direction towards its front end (10).
Test strip analysis system according to claim 2,
characterised in that a stop (32) is provided at an

insertion end of the test strip seat (20) and the
distance between the stop (32) and the retaining

element (26) and the distance between the front end 
(10) of the test strip (4) and the section (28) of

the edge of the recess (17) in the test strip (4)
which faces the front end (10) are coordinated with

one another so that the test strip (4) in the
measuring position butts with its front end (10)

against the stop (32) and rests with the section (28)
of the edge of the recess (17) which faces the front

end (10) on the inclined lateral surface (27) of the
retaining element (26).
Test strip analysis system according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that the test

strip seat (20) is so constructed that in the
measuring position it does not contact the first side

(21) of the test strip (4) between the support (24)
and the pressure element (33), so that the test strip

(4) is tensioned freely between the support (24) and
the pressure element (33).
Test strip analysis system according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that the

pressure element (33) is stationary and bridges the
test strip guide (40) forming a gap (36) between the

test strip seat (20) and the pressure element (33)
through which gap a test strip (4) is passed on

insertion into the test strip holder (3).
Test strip analysis system according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that the

distance (a) of the pressure element (33) from the
boundary (8) of the test field area (13) which faces

the front end (10) of the test strip (4) amounts to
between 0.35 times and 0.65 times the distance (b)

between the boundary of the test field (6) which
faces the front end (10) and the support (24). 
Test strip analysis system according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that the test

strip seat (20) is shorter than the length of the
test strip (4), so that its handling end (16)

projects beyond the test strip seat (20).
Test strip analysis system according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that the test

strip holder (3) comprises elastic spring elements
(39), located on both sides of the guide (40), said

elastic spring elements pressing against the edges of
the test strip (4) in the handling section (15)

whereby the test strip (4) is pressed against the
test strip seat (20).
