<ABSTRACT>
A food treating device (100) includes an outer housing (A) fixed on a base 
(D), an inner housing (B) disposed inside the outer housing (A) in a spaced 

manner with a heater (H) mounted on the inner housing (B) for heating food 
disposed therein, a stirring rod (R) rotatably mounted in the inner housing 

(B) and drivingly coupled to a motor (M) to be driven thereby via a 
transmission belt (C) and a blower fan (F) disposed outside the housings to 

provide air circulation inside the outer housing (A). A control circuit (300) 
is provided to control the operation of the food treating device (100) in 

an automatic manner. The control circuit includes a central processing unit 
(CPU) having electrically connected thereto a power supply (3) which receives 

an external alternating current (AC) power and provides direct current (DC) 
outputs, an interrupt signal (1) generator which receives an AC signal from 

the power supply and provides an interrupt signal of the frequency of the 
AC signal to synchronizing the CPU, a temperature detector (2) which has a 

thermal sensor (21) for detecting the temperature of the housing, a blower 
controller (4) for controlling the blower fan (F), a heater controller (5) 

for controlling the heater (H), a motor controller (6) for controlling the 
motor (M), a key input circuit comprising a number of input keys to allow a 

user to control the food treating device (100) a display for displaying 
message thereon and a warning buzzer (BZ).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a food 
cooking device and in particular to an automatic bread 
baking device. Kitchen appliances for cooking food generally have only 
single function. For example, a bread baking device can 
only be used to bake breads and cannot be used to prepare 
jam or cook rice so that there is required a number of 
different function appliances in a kitchen for preparing 
food in different ways. This obviously increases the cost 
and may be quite inconvenient in doing cooking. It is therefore desirable to provide a multi-purpose 
food treating device for preparing foods in different ways 
according the settings selected by a user to allow food to 
be prepared or treated in an automatic manner. The principal objective of the present invention is to 
provide a multi-purpose food treating device which is 
capable to bake breads and cakes, making jam and cooking 
rice. It is another objective of the present invention to 
provide a multi-purpose food treating device which comprises  
 
a control panel to allow a user to set the operation cycle 
of the food treating device. To achieve the above objectives, there is provided a 
food treating device comprising an outer housing fixed on a 
base, an inner housing disposed inside the outer housing in 
a spaced manner with a heater mounted on the inner housing 
for heating food disposed therein, a stirring rod rotatably 
mounted in the inner housing and drivingly coupled to a 
motor to be driven thereby via a transmission belt and a 
blower fan disposed outside the housings to provide air 
circulation inside the outer housing. A control circuit is 
provided to control the operation of the food treating 
device in an automatic manner. The control circuit 
comprises a central processing unit (CPU) having 
electrically connected thereto a power supply which receives 
an external alternating current (AC) power and provides 
direct current (DC) outputs, an interrupt signal generator 
which receives an AC signal from the power supply and 
provides an interrupt signal of the frequency of the AC 
signal to synchronising the CPU, a temperature detector 
which has a thermal sensor for detecting the temperature of 
the housing, a blower controller for controlling the blower 
fan, a heater controller for controlling the heater, a motor 
controller for controlling the motor, a key input circuit 
comprising a number of input keys to allow a user to control 
the food treating device, a display for displaying message 
thereon and a warning buzzer.
