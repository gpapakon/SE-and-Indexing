<ABSTRACT>
The device according to the invention for injecting liquids comprises a removable connector (4) to be inserted between the outlet (5) of a pressurised liquid feed device (3) and the inlet (6) of an injection conduit (1) such as a hypodermic needle. The removable connector (4) comprises a threshold non-return valve (7), an upstream pipe (9) and a downstream pipe (12) which are preferably made of a transparent material. The removable connector (4) prevents retrograde contamination. It can be disposed of with the injection conduit (1) after each use, without it being necessary to dispose of the rest of the device.

Device for medical use for injecting liquids,
including liquid conduction tube means and a

threshold check valve means (7) to transport
liquids unidirectionally between the outlet (5)

of a liquid supplying device (3) under pressure
and the inlet (6) of an injection conduit (1)

such as a cathelon, a catheter, a hypodermic or
intravenous needle, device characterized in that

it comprises :

a removable and interchangeable connecting piece
(4) composed of :


a threshold check valve (7) adapted to prevent
the flow of liquid from its outlet (13) to its

inlet (11) and to authorize the flow of liquid
from its inlet (11) to its outlet (13) when

the liquid pressure at its inlet (11) exceeds
the outlet pressure (13) according to a value

which is greater than or equal to a determined
activation threshold (S),
an upstream tubular part (9), with a first end
provided with a inlet female end piece (10)

adapted for a deconnectable connection to an
outlet tube (5) of the liquid supplying device

(3), with a second end connected to the inlet (11)
of the threshold check valve (7), and with a

simple upstream tube connecting the inlet end 
piece (10) to the inlet (11) of the threshold

check valve means (7).
a downstream tubular part (12), with a first
end connected to the outlet (13) of the

threshold check valve means (7), with a second
end provided with an outlet end piece (14)

adapted for a direct deconnectable connection
to the inlet (6) of the injection conduit (1),

and with a simple downstream tube connecting
the outlet (13) of the threshold check valve

means (7) to the outlet end piece (14).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the threshold check valve means (7)

comprises a first stopping chamber (17)
containing a first stopping disc (18), and a

second stopping chamber (117) containing a second
stopping disc (118), with the stopping chambers

(17, 117) being successive and the stopping discs
(18, 118) carring out a double stoppage.
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the threshold check valve (7) includes a

valve body (15) made by assembling three parts
(40, 41, 45) drilled with channels (16) for

passing liquid and forming the said successive
stopping chambers (17, 117) each containing a

resiliently supple transverse stopping disc (18, 118)
the upstream face periphery (19, 119) of which bears

upon a intermediary seat (20, 120) of the valve 
body (15) and the downstream face (21, 121) of

which is axially stressed upstream by a central
needle (22, 122) in the valve body (15).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the upstream (9) and

downstream (12) tubular parts are made out of a
transparent material, thus displaying the

appearance of the liquid passing through them.
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 4
characterized in that at least the downstream

tubular part (12) is made out of a material
giving it a suppleness adapted to the movement

and the orientation of the injection conduit (1).
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the upstream tubular part (9) is also

supple.
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the length of the upstream tubular part (9)

is between 1 and 4 centimeters approximately.
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the upstream tubular part

(9) is made out of a rigid material.
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the determined activation

threshold (S) is between 50 and 400 hectopascal. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that it further comprises an

intermediary feeding tube (23) including :

an outlet branch (24) provided with a second
threshold check valve (25) preventing liquid

from going back up from its outlet (26) to its
inlet (27) and authorizing the liquid to pass

downstream when the pressure at the inlet (27)
of the second check valve (25) exceeds the

pressure at its outlet (26) according to a
second determined activation threshold (S2),

the oulet branch (24) comprising, downstream
from the second check valve (25), a short tube

(28) which is less than 2 centimeters long
approximately,
an inlet branch (29) adapted to connect the
inlet of the outlet branch (24) up to a liquid

supplying device (3) provided with
overpressure and negative pressure generation

means,
a filling branch (30) adapted to connect the
inlet of the outlet branch (24) up to a liquid

tank (31), the filling branch (30) being
equipped with a third weak or nil threshold (S3)

check valve (32).
Device according to Claim 10, characterized in
that the second activation threshold (S2) of the

second check valve (25) is less than the first
activation threshold (S) of the check valve (7)

of the removable connection piece (4).
