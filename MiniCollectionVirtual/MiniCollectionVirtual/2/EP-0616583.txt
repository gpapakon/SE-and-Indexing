<ABSTRACT>
Cab assemblies utilized on modern day construction vehicles normally include a myriad of sheet metal components that are welded or bolted together to provide the structural support and the mountings for the various components that comprise a cab. The number of components and the time required to fabricate and weld, or otherwise assemble them, is often quite extensive. The more piece-parts that are required in the configuration of a cab, the more time is required to complete the assembly process. This translates directly into the cost of a cab assembly. The present invention provides a cab assembly (10) that utilizes a non-metallic floor member (50) as an integral part of its structure. The floor member (50) not only incorporates the hardware required for mounting various components housed within the cab assembly (10), it also provides support for the cab's windshield assembly. The windshield assembly is mounted between the floor member (50) and a structural member (34) positioned in the vicinity of the cab's roof. Both structural members are adapted to provide surfaces (40, 42, 44, 62, 64, 66) to which the windshield assembly (76) may be bonded. The combined result of these features provides a cab assembly (10) that has a greatly reduced number of components and is therefore extremely economical and efficient in its design.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the construction 
of a cab assembly 
according to the preamble of claim 1. In prior cab designs, the use of non-metallic 
material in the region of the floor has been 
limited in its usage. In many instances, a rubber 
matting has been incorporated in the sheet metal 
configuration of the floor assembly to both reduce 
noise and dampen vibration and sound. In other 
designs, a non-metallic floor structure provides a 
relatively substantial base for the cab assembly; 
however, it is intended to rest upon the structural 
members of the cab and does little more than support 
the weight of the operator. A cab assembly according to the preamble of claim 1 is known 
from EP-A-0 198 546. In one aspect of the present invention, a 
cab assembly is provided that includes a frame 
assembly that has a lower portion and an upper 
portion. The lower and upper portions are spaced from 
one another and are interconnected by a plurality of 
generally vertically oriented support members. 
Disposed within the cab assembly are an operator's 
seat and a plurality of controls with which to operate 
a vehicle to which the cab assembly is attached. A  
 
non-metallic floor member is provided that is secured 
to the lower frame portion in load bearing relation 
thereto and is adapted for integrally mounting and 
supporting the seat assembly and vehicle controls 
thereon. A mounting support for a windshield assembly is integrally 
formed by the floor member. In another aspect of the present invention, 
a cab assembly is provided that forms an enclosure for 
a seat assembly and plurality of vehicle controls. 
The cab assembly includes a rollover protection 
structure that has a generally rectangular lower 
portion and a generally rectangular upper portion. A 
plurality of vertically oriented posts interconnect 
the upper and lower portions of the rollover 
protection structure at the corners thereof. A plate 
member is mounted on the upper portion in overlying 
relationship therewith. A non-metallic floor member 
is included that has a projection formed on an end 
portion thereof and a support lip is further defined 
on the projection. The non-metallic floor member is 
sufficient for placement upon the lower portion of the 
rollover protection structure in load bearing 
relationship therewith to mount and support the seat 
and vehicle controls. The floor member is positioned 
with the projection extending forwardly of the 
rollover protection structure. A windshield assembly 
is included that has a lower

a non-metallic floor member (50) secured to 
the lower frame portion (22) in load bearing relation 

thereto and being adapted for integrally mounting and 
supporting the seat assembly (12) and vehicle controls 

(14) thereon; and 
a mounting support (50) for a windshield 
assembly (76), said mounting support (50) being 

integrally formed by the floor member. 
A cab assembly (10) as set forth in 
claim 1 wherein the mounting support (50) further 

defines a projection (58) having a supporting lip (72) 
defined along an edge portion (60) thereof, said 

projection (58) extending laterally and slightly 
upwardly from a forward end portion (56) of said floor 

member. 
A cab assembly (10) as set forth in 
claim 2 wherein the windshield assembly (76) includes 

a lower end portion (90) engaged with the supporting 
lip (72) defined by the projection (58) of the floor 

member (50) and an upper portion (92) that is engaged  
 

with the upper portion (20) of the frame assembly (16).
