<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new and useful process for 
preparing a ketone enantiomer. More particularly, it is 
concerned with a novel multi-step process for preparing the 
(4S) -enantiomer of 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-1(2H)-naphthalenone 
in a highly-optically pure form. The latter 
compound, which is a novel (4S)-enantiomer per se, has 
utility as a key intermediate that ultimately leads to the 
production of pure cis-(1S)(4S)-N-methyl-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthaleneamine 
(sertraline), which is a known antidepressant agent. The 
invention also includes within its scope certain other novel 
compounds which are useful as intermediates in the various 
stages of the overall process. There is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,536,518 and 
4,556,676 to W. M. Welch, Jr. et al., as well as in the 
paper of W. M. Welch, Jr. et al., appearing in the Journal 
of Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 27, No. 11, p. 1508 (1984), a 
multi-step method for synthesizing pure racemic cis-(1S)(4S)-N-methyl-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthaleneamine, 
starting from the readily available 3,4-dichlorobenzophenone 
and proceeding via the known racemic or 
(±)-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-butanoic acid and then to (±)-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-1(2H)-naphthalenone 
(see 
also U.S. Patent Nos. 4,777,288 and 4,839,104 to G.J. 
Quallich et al. for improved methods leading to these 
intermediates), with the latter ketone then being condensed 
with methylamine in the presence of titanium tetrachloride 
to yield N-[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-1(2H)-naphthalenylidene]methanamine. 
In the last step of the 
overall synthesis, the aforementioned imine is then readily 
reduced by means of catalytic hydrogenation or by the use of 
a metal hydride complex to yield N-methyl-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthaleneamine,which 
is actually a mixture of the cis- and trans-isomers in the  
 
form of a racemate. The aforesaid isomeric mixture is then 
separated into its component parts by conventional means, 
e.g., by fractional crystallization of the hydrochloride 
salts or by column chromatography on silica gel of the 
corresponding free base. Resolution of the separated cis-racemate 
free base compound while in solution with an 
optically-active selective precipitant acid, such as D-(-)-mandelic 
acid, in a classical manner then ultimately affords 
the desired cis-(1S)(4S)-enantiomer (sertraline). Nevertheless, the above described production of pure 
cis-(1S)(4S)-N-methyl-4-(3,
