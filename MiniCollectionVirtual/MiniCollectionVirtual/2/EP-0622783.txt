<ABSTRACT>
A servo circuit for a magnetic disk apparatus which 
controls a servo object (212) based on an error between a 

target speed and a real speed, in which a pre-determined 
control voltage is added to the control signal for the 

servo object at the start of speed control.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a servo circuit for
a magnetic disk apparatus which performs speed control over
a servo object based on an error between a target speed and
a real speed, more particularly relates to ones which
perform speed control by passing a seek current corresponding
to the error between the target speed and the real
speed to a voice coil motor and to one having a speed
signal generating circuit for finding the real speed.
Circuits of this general type are known from our earlier
application EP-A-0,272,076.Servo circuits are used in magnetic disk apparatuses
for positioning magnetic heads on specific tracks. In such
servo circuits, it is desired to reduce the time required
for the speed control and to shorten the access time and to
obtain stable positioning even with higher speeds.In particular, in recent years, higher speeds have
been achieved in the seek access operations, which move and
stop a head in a disk apparatus at a target track position.
Along with the higher speeds of seek access operations,
much higher speeds have been sought for so-called "one
difference" seek access operations wherein the heads are
moved to the adjoining track position. A demand has
therefore arisen for a servo circuit with a high response
commensurate with the higher speeds of "one difference"
seek operations.Explaining the related art in more detail, in a servo
circuit, speed control is used up to near the target
position, then position control is switched to so as to
control the positioning to the target position. However,
the frequency characteristic of the servo object has a
resonance point, i.e., a resonance point of the servo arm
such as the carriage of the servo object. If the frequency
of a speed control signal, explained later, appears in the
band which covers this resonance point, mechanical
oscillation appears during the seek operation and therefore 
there is no hope for improvement of the floating stability
of the magnetic head and the stability after switching to
fine control.The frequency band of an amplifier of a speed error
detection circuit, explained later, is determined by the
time constant of a resistor and capacitor of a filter. The
cut-off frequency must be made smaller than the resonance
point. In recent years, however, higher speed access has
become desirable. With a "one difference" seek operation,
the acceleration/deceleration current cycle of the speed
control signal becomes close to the cut-off frequency.
Therefore, the current waveform, in particular, the current
waveform
