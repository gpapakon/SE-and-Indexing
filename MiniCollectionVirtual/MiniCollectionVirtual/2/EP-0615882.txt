<ABSTRACT>
A support bracket (10) for mounting a mirror (11) 
on a vehicle, the support bracket (10) having at one end 

means (12) for mounting the bracket onto a vehicle and 
means (17) at the other end for mounting a mirror. The 

means for mounting the mirror comprises retaining means 
(19) to substantially prevent disengagement of the mirror 

(11) from the bracket (10). A rearview mirror case (11) is 
disclosed wherein the case comprises a case body (21) 

having an integrally formed socket (22) for receiving one 
end (17) of a complementary support bracket (10). A 

rearview mirror (11) is disclosed comprising a reflective 
element (40) (Figure 4) actuatable between at least two 

reflective conditions and shock absorbing means (73) 
abutting a rear surface of the reflective element (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to rearview mirrors 
for example electro-optic rearview mirrors and in 
particular to electro-optic rearview mirrors in which two 
glass plates sandwich an electro-optic medium. Brackets for supporting rearview mirrors are well 
known in the art, for example in U.S. Patent Nos. 
4,936,533, 5,058,851, 4,524,941 and 4,012,022. The 
rearview mirrors are mounted to the brackets by means of a 
ball and socket connection. A problem with these 
constructions however is that the mirror casing can in 
certain circumstances be removed from the bracket. The 
above prior art Patents also disclose a case for a rearview 
mirror, i.e. a housing for holding the reflective element. 
These housings usually have fixed thereto a socket member 
for receiving the ball part of a support bracket so that 
the mirror housing is adjustable on the bracket. The 
number of components which may be employed in construction 
of such mirror assemblies results in high assembly cost and 
time, and the possibility of vibration between parts. Electro-optic rearview mirrors are well known in 
the art for example in U.S. 5,140,455, U.S. 5,151,816 and 
as described in the following paper:- N.R. Lynam, 
"Electrochromic Automotive Day/Night Mirrors", 
SAE Technical Paper Series, (870636) (1987).  According to one aspect of the present invention 
there is provided a support bracket for mounting an article 
on a vehicle said support bracket having at one end means 
for mounting the bracket onto a vehicle and means at the 
other end for mounting an article, said means for mounting 
the article further comprising retaining means to 
substantially prevent disengagement of said article from 
said bracket. Preferably, the article is a vehicle rearview 
mirror. More preferably the article is a vehicle interior 
rearview mirror. Further preferably, said means for mounting the 
rearview mirror comprises a generally spherical ball for 
insertion in a complementary socket provided in the mirror 
case. More preferably, the retaining means comprises a 
protrusion provided on the spherical ball, said protrusion 
acting to substantially prevent disengagement of said 
mirror case from said bracket. The protrusion preferably comprises a generally 
cylindrical member integrally formed with said spherical 
ball. The protrusion further comprises flange means to 
further prevent disengagement of said mirror case from said 
bracket. According to a second aspect of the present 
invention there is provided a rearview mirror case, wherein

<CLAIMS>
A support bracket for mounting an article on a 
vehicle said support bracket having at one end means for 

mounting the bracket onto a vehicle and means at the other 
end for mounting an article, said means for mounting the 

article further comprising retaining means to substantially 
prevent disengagement of said article from said bracket. 
A support bracket as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the 
article is a vehicle rearview mirror. 
A support bracket as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
wherein the article is a vehicle interior rearview mirror. 
A support bracket as claimed in Claim 2 or 3, 
wherein said means for mounting the rearview mirror 

comprises a generally spherical ball for insertion in a 
complementary socket provided in a mirror case of the 

rearview mirror. 
A support bracket as claimed in Claim 4, wherein the 
retaining means comprises a protrusion provided on the 

spherical ball, said protrusion acting to substantially 
prevent disengagement of said mirror case from said 

bracket. 
A support bracket as claimed in Claim 5 wherein the 
protrusion comprises a generally cylindrical member 

integrally formed with said spherical ball. 
A support bracket as claimed in Claim 6 wherein said 
protrusion comprises flange means to further prevent 

disengagement of said mirror case from said bracket. 
A rearview mirror case, wherein said case comprises 
a case body having an integrally formed socket for 

receiving one end of a complementary support bracket. 
A reflective element for a rearview mirror, said 
reflective element comprising a reflective element 

actuatable between at least two reflective conditions, and 
shock absorbing means abutting a rear surface of said 

reflective element. 
A rearview mirror assembly comprising first and 
second spaced optically transparent elements mounted in a 

mirror case, each having front and rear surfaces and 
defining a space between the rear surface of the first 

element and the front surface of the second element, an 
electro-optic medium confined in said space whose light 

transmittance is variable upon the application of an 
electric field thereto; means for applying an electric 

field to the electro-optic medium to cause a change in the 
light transmittance of said medium; a reflective coating 

on one surface of said second element to reflect light 
incident thereon through said electro-optic medium and said 

first element; and shock absorbing means adhered to the 
rear surface of said second element for reducing the risk 

of breaking of said first and second elements.
