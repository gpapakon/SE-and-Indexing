<ABSTRACT>
A digital filter device can be constructed as time domain filter or as frequency domain filter. Time domain filters require a large computing effort whilst digital frequency domain filters have a delay which is not always permissible, for example in a circuit arrangement for echo compensation in a telephone system. The invention achieves a short signal delay of the filter in conjunction with a limited number of computing steps in that the filter is constructed of two parts, one part being a time domain filter and the other part being a frequency domain filter. The frequency domain filter can be preferably constructed as partitioned filter and receives only some of the coefficients whilst the remaining coefficients are supplied to the frequency domain filter. As a result, a delayless filter is implemented which requires fewer processing operations than a filter constructed completely as time domain filter.

A digital filter device for producing a sequence of digital filter signals
from a sequence of digital input signals fed to a filter input, with the aid of a number N

of filter coefficients, characterized in that the filter (2) comprises a time-domain filter of
the order M1, for producing first filter element signals using the first M1 coefficients,

and a frequency-domain filter (24) of the order M2, for producing second filter element
signals using the following M2 coefficients, where M1+M2=N, where the sum of the

first and second filter element signals represents the filter signal.
The filter device according to Claim 2,

characterized in that the frequency-domain filter (24) is formed by (K-p) partitions for

block-by-block processing of M signals, where M=N/K, K=2,3,4... and p=1,2... 
<
K,
where M1=M.p and M2=M(K-p).
The filter device as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that Kâ‰¥4 and
p=2.
A circuit arrangement for echo suppression having a first filter according
to Claim 1 which is connected between a receiving path (1) for received signals and one

input of a superposition arrangement, another input of which is set up for receiving a
signal which is formed by superpositioning of a locally produced signal and a changed

received signal, and having a computation arrangement (4; 40), and a second filter (42)
for repeated adaptive production of coefficients for the first filter.
The circuit arrangement according to Claim 3, the second filter being a
further frequency-domain filter, and this further frequency-domain filter together with

the frequency-domain filter of the first filter being formed by partitions for block-by-block
processing of M signals each, characterized in that the first partition comprises a

transformation arrangement (44) which is common to both frequency-domain filters, for
carrying out an orthogonal transformation of a block of input signals, and the following

partitions comprise each one memory arrangement (50, 52, 54) which is common to
both frequency-domain filters, for storing a block of transformed signals produced by

the transformation arrangement (44) or by the memory arrangement (50, 52) of the
preceding partition.
