<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rotary glazing and 
decorating machine for ceramic tiles, employing a 

rotary apparatus comprising a matrix-bearing 
cylinder (4) coupled on an underlying transfer 

cylinder (5) contacting over at least a tract of 
external surface thereof with an upper surface of 

a tile (2) transiting on a rest plane (1). The 
tile (2) is gripped between two facing branches 

(17) and (17') of two lateral belts (7) and (7') 
which advance the tile (2) below the transfer 

cylinder (5); the rotation of the transfer 
cylinder (5) being synchronized with the 

translation of the tile (2) moved by the branches 
(17) and (17').

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a rotary ceramic tile 
glazing and decorating machine. The prior art 
teaches such machines wherein the decoration of 
the tiles is effected by means of a transfer 
system, widely used in printing, where the 
pattern is engraved on a chalcographic drum, which 
is first supplied with glaze and when rotating 
contacts an underlying and also-rotating 
intermediate transfer roller. The underlying 
roller is in direct contact with the tile and 
transfers thereto the pattern originating from the 
engraved drum. A horizontal conveyor advances the 
tiles, which are then pushed under the 
intermediate transfer roller, which latter is 
covered in rubber so as to exhibit a slight 
elastic deformability in order to adjust to small 
breadth differences between the various tiles 
passing thereunder. A support roller, positioned 
below the intermediate roller, compresses the tile 
(with a predetermined pressure) against the  
 
intermediate roller during the printing phase. An 
apparatus of this type is described in 
EP-A-0278650. Also disclosed in the prior art is the use of silk 
screens for decorating tiles, wherein the transfer 
of the glaze on to the tiles is performed through 
the cylindrical surface of the screen, which rolls 
on the tile. The glaze inside the screen is pushed 
outwards by spatula devices. All the illustrated embodiments, both indirect 
(with the presence of an intermediate transfer 
roller) and direct (using a rotary silk screen) 
present numerous drawbacks which render them 
useful only in a small number of applications. In 
particular, they are used almost exclusively in 
decorations reproducing, for example, veined stone 
or marble effects and the like. Finally, the prior art solutions do not afford 
constant results, as it is impossible to obtain 
multicolored patterns of an acceptable quality, 
that is of a quality which can be obtained using 
traditional flat and single-color dedicated silk 
screens. A further common drawback in the prior art 
applications, especially those wherein the  
 
decoration is performed by indirect transfer of 
the image, is that it is difficult to achieve a 
perfect cleaning operation on the transfer roller, 
and therefore guarantee a perfect reproduction of 
the pattern on the tile. With respect in particular to rotary silk screen 
apparatus, further drawbacks are inherent in 
relation to the structure of the screen itself, 
which includes internal ribbing. The present invention, as it is characterized in 
the claims that follow,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A rotary ceramic tile glazing and decorating 
machine, in particular for ceramic tiles, 

comprising: 

a rest plane (1) for transporting tiles (2); 
said rest plane (1) being in line with a tile 

conveyor (3); 
the rotary glazing and decorating part of the 
machine being 

positioned above the rest plane (1) and comprising 
a matrix-bearing cylinder (4) coupled on an 

underlying transfer cylinder (5) predisposed such 
that an external cylindrical surface thereof at 

least partially contacts an upper surface of the 
tiles (2); characterised in that it further comprises: 
a gripping and transport device of the tiles (2) 
situated such as to project superiorly with 

respect to the rest plane (1) and below the 
transfer cylinder (5); the device comprising two 

belts (7) and (7') exhibiting two branches (17) 
and (17'), positioned diametrically opposite with 

respect to an advancement direction of the tiles 
(2) and predisposed to contact opposite lateral  

 
edges thereof and adhere thereto by friction 

force; said branches (17) and (17') being speed-synchronized 
in a tile advancement direction; 
a sensor (8) for signalling when a tile (2), 
gripped between the branches (17) and (17') has 

reached a predetermined position on the rest plane 
(1); 
means for commanding a synchronization of a 
rotation of at least the transfer cylinder (5) 

with a translation of the branches (17) and (17') 
gripping the tiles (2). 
A machine as in claim 1, characterised in that it 
comprises: 


a code reading device (9) for reading an 
identification code provided on each of the tiles 

(2); 
a device for reading an angular position of the 
transfer cylinder (5) when the sensor (8) has 

signalled a presence of a tile (2); said 
identification code reading, together with the 

reading of an angular position of the transfer 
cylinder (5) constituting reference data by which 

the transfer cylinder (5), through a variation in 
speed e
ffected before contact with the tile (2),  
 

is synchronized with the advancement direction of 
the tile (2) gripped between the branches (17) and 

(17') of the belts (7) and (7'). 
A machine as in claim 1, characterised in that the 
matrix-bearing cylinder (4) comprises a 

cylindrical silk screen free of welding and 
ribbing and provided with an internal device for 

forcing glaze externalwise of the matrix-bearing 
cylinder (4). 
A machine as in claim 1, characterised in that the 
transfer cylinder (5) comprises a roller 

exhibiting a thin external wear-resistant coating 
(15) predisposed on an underlying thicker layer of

(15). 
A machine as in claim 1, characterised in that it 
comprises a doctor (16) contacting the external 

surface of the transfer cylinder (5) at a prefixed 
pressure; said doctor (16) alternating parallel to 

the axis of the transfer cylinder (5). 
A machine as in claim 1, characterised in that the  
 

transfer cylinder (5) is mechanically connected in
