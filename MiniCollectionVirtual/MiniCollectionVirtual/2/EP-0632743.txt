<ABSTRACT>
A zeo-type material may be deposited on a porous support to provide a zeolite membrane for separation and/or catalysis, by a process in which before the zeo-type material is crystallized on the support in step (iii), the support has been contacted in step (i) with a solution or suspension of a source of silicic acid to bond oligomers of silicic acid thereonto, and then in step (ii) said support carrying the bonded oligomer and said solution or suspension are separated.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DEPOSITION PROCESSThe present invention relates to a deposition process' useful in membrane preparation. Î¨Zeolites and related crystalline-' materials are well known for their ability to accomplish separations and to act as catalysts. Membranes are well known in separations applications, and merabranss incorporating zeolites are known. These membranes are of a number of distinct types.CA 1235684 claims a filter for substance separation, comprisiiag a substrate made of a porous glass and a zeolite-based film formed directly on the porous glass, the zeolite-based film having a thickness of 1 micron to 500 microns. The filter is prepared by suspending, for example, a borosilicate glass in an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and tetrapropylammonium bromide, and heating im an autoclave. JP-A-63291809 describes a membrane comprising a film of zeolite on a porous alumina carrier.EP-A-180200 describes a membrane comprising a porous support impregnated with fine particles of a zeolite. The membrane is prepared by permeating, for example, an ultrafiltration membrane, or a porous glass, with an alkaline solution of ultrafine (e.g. less than 75 angstrom diameter) zeolite particles. These particles become lodged in the pores of the support.EP-A-180200 describes a process for preparing a zeolite membrane in which a zeolite synthesis gel is passed through a microfilter and deposited in a thin film on the surface of a 

support.DE-A-3827049 describes a zeolite membrane consisting of a layer of zeolitic crystals on a porous support. During preparation of the membrane, the support is provided with a nucleo-active surface by immersing the porous support for a short time in an alumina-containing solution, and then evaporating the solvent.Our European patent application No. 91309239 (published as EP-A-481660), whose disclosure is herein incorporated by reference, describes a process for the production of a membrane comprising a film of a zeo-type material over the pores of a porous support, which comprises immersing at least one surface of a porous support in a synthesis gel which is capable of crystallising to produce a crystalline zeo-type material; inducing crystallisation of said gel so that zeo-type material crystallises on the support; removing the support from the mix; and repeating these steps one or more times to obtain a membrane in which the zeo-type material is crystallised directly from and bonds directly to the support. It also describes a novel membrane which comprises crystals of a zeo-type material

Claims :
1. A process for the deposition of a zeo-type material on a porous support, which comprises the following steps: i) contacting at least one surface of the porous support with a solution or suspension containing a source of silicic acid, under conditions such that oligomers of silicic acid become bonded directly to said surface of the support; ii) separating the support with said oligomers bonded thereto and said solution or suspension containing a source of silicic acid; and iii) subsequently contacting said surface of the support with a synthesis gel which is capable of crystallising to produce a crystalline zeo-type material, and inducing crystallisation of said gel so that zeo-type material crystallises on said surface.
2. A process according to claim 1 characterised in that step (i) comprises immersing said surface in said solution or suspension, step (ii) comprises removing said support from said solution or suspension and step (iii) comprises immersing said surface in said gel.
3. A process according to claim 1 or 2 characterised in that between steps (ii) and (iii) the support with said oligomers bonded thereto is washed to remove said solution or suspension and any loose material.
4. A process according to any one of the preceding claims characterised in that in step (i) the surface is immersed in a synthesis gel, which is capable of crystallizing to produce a crystalline zeo-type material, for a period of time sufficient to 


bond said oligomers to said surface.
5. A process according to claim 4 characterised in that the Immersion step (iii) is into a fresh synthesis gel.
6. A process according to any one of the preceding claims characterised In that the porous support before step (I) incorporates a surface coating of nickel, cobalt and/or molybdenum, in the form of the metal and/or its oxide.
