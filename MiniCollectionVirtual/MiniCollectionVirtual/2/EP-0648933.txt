<ABSTRACT>
A scroll compressor having a driving shaft 6, on 
which a bushing 10 and a balancing weight 9 are 

supported. The drive shaft 6 includes, at its end, a 
drive projection 6a, which is engaged with a driven 

groove 10a formed in the bushing 10. A spring 20 is 
arranged between the drive projection 6a and the 

bushing 10 for urging the latter radially inwardly to 
reduce the radius of the orbital movement of the 

bushing 10. A centrifugal force generated in the bushing 
when the drive shaft 6 is rotated causes the bushing 10 

to be moved radially outwardly to increasing the radius 
of the orbital movement of the bushing 10.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a scroll-type compressor according 
to the preamble of claim 1. A scroll compressor of this kind is known from DE-A-39 11 
882 wherein a spring is provided for biasing a projection 
engaging a groove in such a way that the scroll wall of the 
movable scroll member is in contact with the scroll wall of the 
stationary scroll member. EP-A-0 457 603 discloses a scroll-type fluid displacement 
apparatus, wherein an elastic member is provided between a crank 
pin and a journal for changing the operational angle at a 
follower crank mechanism in accordance with the compression 
reaction force. GB-A-2 191 246 discloses a scroll-type compressor, wherein 
a spring is provided for biasing the movable scroll member in 
such a way that the movable scroll member is brought into contact 
with the scroll wall of the stationary scroll member, as it is 
the case according to the firstly mentioned prior art embodiment.  
 During the compression operation, the scroll 
walls of the fixed and movable scroll members are brought 
into contact with each other at a plurality of spaced 
locations. Thus, any inaccuracy in the shape of the 
fixed and movable scroll members at these location from 
the desired shape causes the medium to leak, thereby  
 
reducing the compression efficiency. Thus, some means is 
necessary to compensate the above mentioned inaccuracy in 
the shape of the scroll members, thereby maintaining the 
desired contacted condition between the scroll portions 
of the fixed and movable scroll members. Thus, in the Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication (Kokai) No. 2-176179, a construction is 
proposed wherein the scroll compressor has a drive shaft 
having, at its one end, drive projections defining 
driving force transmission surfaces, and a bushing having 
grooves defining driving force receiving surfaces. These 
drive projections and grooves are engaged with each other 
in such a manner that the driving force transmission 
surfaces and driving force receiving surfaces are 
slidably movable with each other. Furthermore, the 
planes on the driving projections are, with respect to a 
line passing through the axis of the bushing and of the 
rotating shaft, inclined rearwardly in the direction of 
the rotation of the rotating shaft. Thus, when the bushing receives a compression 
reaction force from the movable scroll member, the 
bushing moves along the planes on the driving 
projections, so that the radius of the orbital movement 
of the movable scroll during the operating (rotating)

A scroll compressor comprising: 

a housing; 
a drive shaft (6) rotatably supported on the 
housing; 
a first scroll member (1) arranged in the 
housing and fixed to the housing; 
a second scroll member (11) movably arranged in 
the housing; 
the first and second scroll members having 
scroll portions (1b,11b) which are arranged in a side-by-side 

relationship in a radial direction so that radially 
spaced chambers (S) are created; 
a bushing (10) arranged eccentric to the drive 
shaft (6) to receive the rotating movement therefrom; 
connecting means between the drive shaft 
and the bushing in the form of a projection (6a) engaging a groove (10a) for allowing the transmission of the 

rotating movement of the drive shaft to the bushing so as 
to obtain an orbital movement of the bushing about an 

axis of the drive shaft, said drive projection (6a) defining a 
drive plane (6a

drive shaft while extending substantially radially, and said 

groove (10a) defining a drive force receiving plane (10a

in parallel along the axis of the drive shaft, while 

extending substantially radially, and which is slidably 
guided along the drive plane, 
means (15) for preventing the scroll member (11) on 
the bushing (10) from being rotated about its own axis, while 

allowing an orbital movement of the movable scroll member (11) 
about an axis of the drive shaft (6), so that said radially 

spaced chambers (S) move radially inward, while the volume of 
the chambers is reduced;
