<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for an impulsed blowing of compressed air in order to remove caked or accumulated material of bulk goods in containers, bunkers, silos or the like relating to method techniques. The inventive device comprises a compressed air storage container (1) to which compressed air is delivered from a reservoir via a line (24). The device also comprises an outlet opening (8) for the impulsed blowing of compressed air from the storage container (1), a quick-action ventilating valve (6) arranged on said storage container (1), and a piston (11) which is guided in a cylinder (12). Said piston is pressed against the outlet opening (8) during a corresponding pressure build-up in the piston chamber (20). In addition, the outlet opening (8) closes and during ventilation of the piston chamber (20), the piston is abruptly lifted from the outlet opening (8) such that the compressed air in the storage container (1) exits via the outlet opening (8) in an impulsed manner. The piston chamber (20) of the quick-action ventilating valve (6) which is separated from the compressed air delivery to the storage container (1) can be pressurized with compressed air.
