<ABSTRACT>
The switch (1) has a rotary operating element (3) and a rotatable inner part (1), cooperating with a motion converter for converting the rotation into a linear movement for opening and closing the switch contacts. A locking element (2) cooperating with an electromagnetic bolt (10) holds the switch in a given position, preventing its rotation back to the neutral position, for extraction of the key.

<CLAIMS>
Rotary switch (1) having, in a first housing (5),
components relevant to the rotational movement, having an

actuating element (3) and a rotatable inner part (6) via
both of which components switch contacts of said rotary

switch (1) are opened and closed, 
characterised in
that
 coupled to the rotary switch (1) is a locking element
(2) with a separate second housing (7) having an

electromagnet (8) and a bolt (10) that can be influenced
thereby, is moveable along its longitudinal axis, and will

block or release the rotational movement depending on its
position.
Rotary switch according to Claim 1 
characterised
in that
 the bolt (10) is made at least partly of a
ferromagnetic material and serves as an armature (12).
Rotary switch according to Claim 1 or 2
characterised in that
 the locking element (2)
has acknowledgement contacts (11) that are closed depending

on the position of the armature (12).
Rotary switch according to one of the preceding Claims

characterised in that
 the bolt (10) can be
connected flush to one of the components (3, 6) relevant to

the rotational movement.
Rotary switch according to one of the preceding Claims

characterised in that
 the locking element (2) is
snap-mounted onto the rotary switch (1).
Rotary switch according to one of the preceding Claims

characterised in that
 the locking element (2) 
can be snap-mounted onto the rotary switch (1).
