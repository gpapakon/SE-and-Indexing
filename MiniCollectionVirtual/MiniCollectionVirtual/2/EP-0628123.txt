<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a wedge action connector, especially for construction equipment, with an extended support, a releasably securable holding component longitudinally movable thereon which is stable in position at various longitudinal points on the support, which has an aperture at least partially surrounding a support with a limited range of movement, the cross-section of which is somewhat larger in at least one direction transversely to the support than the latter's corresponding cross-section, and with a securing wedge having two impact ends, the cross-section of which increases in its longitudinal direction, which can also be inserted through a safety aperture merging into the acceptance aperture and which in the secured position, bearing laterally on the support, clamps the holding component securely in position against the support. To improve handling and reduce the space required, the invention proposes that the safety wedge is arc-shaped and both its impact ends point roughly in the same direction.

Wedge action connector, particularly for building 
implements, with a long mounting carrier, with a fixing 

element which can be moved thereon in its longitudinal 
direction and can be fixed at various longitudinal 

positions of the mounting carrier in a positionally 
stable and detachable manner, which fixing element has 

an acceptance opening at least partially surrounding 
the mounting carrier with limited movement play, the 

transverse dimension of which acceptance opening, in at 
least one direction transverse to the longitudinal 

direction of the mounting carrier, is somewhat larger 
than the latter's corresponding transverse dimension, 

and with a retaining wedge having two impact ends, 
whose cross-section increases in its longitudinal 

direction, which can also be inserted into the fixing 
element through a retaining opening blending into the 

acceptance opening and which in the fixing position and
