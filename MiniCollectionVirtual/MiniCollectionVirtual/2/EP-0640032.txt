<ABSTRACT>
Inorganic fiber-reinforced thermoplastic articles are produced from precisely proportioned feed mixtures of particles of thermoplastic polymer, a polymer modifier and inorganic fiber bundles supplied, under specified conditions, directly to an injection molding apparatus. The articles exhibit exceptionally superior heat deflection temperature compared to articles produced from feeds which are precompounded prior to injection molding.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process to produce molded articles
of thermoplastic polymer reinforced with inorganic fiber and having
excellent physical properties, especially high heat deflection temperature.In conventional injection molding processes for making fiber-reinforced,
thermoplastic polymer articles, raw material is supplied to the
molding machine as pellets made by a precompounding process. The
precompounded pellets are composed of thermoplastic polymer,
reinforcement fiber and other ingredients including, for example, stabilizers,
pigments, processing aids, modifiers and fillers. The precompounding step
provides all the ingredients to the molding operation in proper proportion in
convenient form and does not require handling them individually. It also
disperses the ingredients for effectiveness in the article produced by the
subsequent molding step. Precompounding does, however, add significantly
to overall molded article production cost because it requires a second
melting of the materials, isolation of pelletized intermediate product with
attendant cost for yield loss and packaging, and usually a second drying
operation before precompounded pellets are fed to the molding machine.
Mixing during precompounding also causes fiber comminution to shorter
length than was fed to the precompounding apparatus. Short fibers impart
inferior physical properties, such as stiffness measured by flexural modulus
and heat resistance measured by heat deflection temperature, than do long
fibers. Because the precompounding step requires processing in the melt
phase, matrix polymer is necessarily exposed to high temperatures and is
subject to thermal degradation.Sometimes polymer modifiers which are incompatible with the
matrix polymer, such as toughening agents to improve impact resistance of
the molded article, are added. Intensive mixing is required to disperse the
agents in the matrix polymer. Unfortunately, intensive melt mixing also
causes comminution of the reinforcement fibers. If the ingredients of the composition could be fed to the molding machine
directly, it would be possible to avoid the adverse performance effects and increased
costs of operating the precompounding step. However, when chopped glass fiber
bundles are conveyed and fed to injection molding machines together with unprecompounded
thermoplastic polymer compositions, problems are often encountered.
One problem is that the fiber bundles segregate from the pellet resin because of bulk
density and flow characteristics. Another problem is

<CLAIMS>
A process for the direct fabrication of fibre-reinforced injection-moulded
articles having a high heat deflection temperature comprising the following

steps:-

1) mixing separate components comprising at least one thermoplastic
polymer and reinforcement fibres,
2) drying the polymer prior to mixing with the fibres,
3) feeding the mixture to a moulding machine, and
4) moulding the mixture at elevated temperature to produce moulded
articles, characterised in that:


a) said separate components include a modifier selected from an
elastomeric toughening agent, crystallisation rate agent or a viscosity reduction agent,
b) the components having been dried prior to mixing in step (1),
c) the drying of the thermoplastic polymer and the modifier in the form of
particles being carried out to achieve a moisture content which prevents hydrolytic

degradation of a predominant fraction of the thermoplastic polymer upon exposure to
a temperature of up to 300Â°C and maintaining the components in such dry condition

prior to step (4),
d) combining the thermoplastic polymer and modifier with fibre bundles
just prior to feeding to the moulding machine and blending the components at such

intensity that the fibre bundles retain their integrity for a sufficient duration to cause
the blend to have a uniform concentration, and
e) said fibre bundles having a fibre length from 1.5 to 13 mm and
constituting from 10 to 60 weight percent of the articles.
A process of claim 1 wherein the inorganic fiber bundles are glass.
A process of claim 1 or 2 wherein said modifier comprises an
elastomeric toughening agent selected from ethylene copolymers, styrene copolymer-based

elastomers and block copolyetherester elastomers.
A process of any one of the preceding claims wherein the thermoplastic
polymer is a polyester.
A process of claim 4 wherein polyester and modifier are dried to a
moisture content of less than 0.02 wt.%.
A process of claim 4 or 5 wherein the polyester is polyethylene
terephthalate and the polymer modifier further comprises a polyethylene terephthalate

crystallization rate enhancement agent.
A process of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the thermoplastic
polymer is polyamide.
A process of claim 7 wherein polyamide and modifier are dried to a
moisture content of less than 0.2 wt.%.
