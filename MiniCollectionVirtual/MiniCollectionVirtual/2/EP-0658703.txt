<ABSTRACT>
A vibration damping device includes axially spaced 
first and second end members (2,5) adapted to be mounted on spaced 

apart structures. An intermediate member (15) is mounted within 
an open end of the second end member. A center member (26) 

consisting of a rigid tube (27) having a hollow bore (31) and a lower 
piston (28) is connected to the first end member (2) and extends 

through the interior of the intermediate member (15). The tube 
forms an annular orifice which extends about a rigid electrode 

rod (60) which extends through the rigid tube and which is also 
connected to the first end member and piston but electrically 

isolated therefrom. A pair of elastomeric sleeves (45,53) extend 
between the intermediate member and first end member and 

between the intermediate member and the piston to form a pair 
of fluid chambers (51,58) communicating with the orifice and adapted 

to contain an electrorheological fluid. Each of the sleeves 
has a rolling lobe (50,54) with circular centers and different radii 

of curvature. However, the circular centers of the rolling 
lobes lie on a common imaginary axially extending cylinder 

whereby the effective areas of the fluid chambers remain 
substantially equal as the device moves between jounce and 

rebound positions to reduce the spring rate effect on the 
damper. Even though the rolling lobes have the same circular 

centers the radii of the lobe forming walls are different 
which enables nesting of the piston within the intermediate 

member to reduce the axial height of the device without 
affecting its stroke length.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to vibration damping devices 
which develop damping performance when being applied to a 
suspension member such as for automobiles or other equipment. 
More particularly, the invention relates to such a damping 
device using an electrorheological fluid as the damping 
medium, which device has a shorter axial height than prior 
similar damping devices without sacrificing stroke length, and 
in which the spring rate of the device is minimized during 
damping by equalizing the effective areas of a pair of 
elastomeric sleeves which form fluid chambers that contain the 
electrorheological fluid. Vibration damping devices have been used for a 
considerable period of time to dampen the vibrational forces 
applied to the suspension system of vehicles to provide a 
smoother ride by reducing the vibrations caused by road bumps 
and depressions passing from the tires to the vehicle frame, 
by the interposing of oil filled shock absorbers or high 
pressure gas damping devices. Although these prior art oil and high pressure gas 
damping devices have proven satisfactory, a more recent 
development has evolved in which an electrorheological or 
electroviscous liquid is used within the chambers of the 
damping device, wherein the liquid is in contact with one or 
more electrodes usually mounted in a restrictive passage, 
which depending upon the size of the electrodes and the amount 
of voltage applied to the liquid, will change the viscosity  
 
of the liquid, enabling the damping device to have a greater 
range of damping characteristics than those achieved by the 
high pressure gas or oil filled shock absorbers. U.S. Patent No. 4,973,031 discloses an anti-vibration 
apparatus which uses an expandable liquid chamber 
containing an electrorheological fluid in the chamber. U.S. Patent No. 4,858,733 discloses another damping 
device using electrodes in combination with an electroviscous 
liquid contained within closed chambers and movable through 
a restricted passage, where voltage is applied to the 
electroviscous liquid as it moves through the passage to 
change its viscosity to achieve various damping effects. U.S. Patent No. 5,180,145 discloses another 
vibration damping device which uses an electrorheological 
fluid which passes between two closed chambers formed by 
elastomeric sleeves through a restricted orifice where the 
fluid comes into contact with an electrode mounted in the 
restricted passage. The damping device of this patent 
provides for a shorter axial height than prior similar
