<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a pretreatment method and primer that is applied directly to the hard tissue. The invention has particular utility for adhering to or coating sclerotic dentin and cervical enamel or for adhering to or coating hard tissue in a high humidity environment. The primer enables formation of extremely strong bonds to dentin. The method comprises the steps of: (a) applying to the hard tissue adhesively effective amounts of an acid and a waterdispersible film former comprising a polymer and (b) hardening the film former. Primer compositions are provided for use in this method, comprising a mixture of an acid and a film former comprising a polymer prior to hardening, the mixture being in the form of a film atop the hard tissue.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention
relates to adhesive compositions for use on hard tissue.In recent years there has been intense interest in the dental field in adhesives that
bond to hard tissues such as dentin. Forces generated by the polymerization contraction
of dental restorative materials suggest that a minimum adhesion strength for bonding
restorative materials to hard surfaces in in vivo clinical procedures would be desirable. For
example, M. Jensen, Polymerization Shrinkage and MicroleakageInternational
Symposium on Posterior Composite Resin Dental Restorative Materials, 243-44 (1985)
reports a contraction force of 7.3 MPa. for conventional composite materials. In many
instances the minimum adhesive strength has not been achieved, resulting in direct
communication between dentin and the oral cavity via gaps between the dental restorative
material and the cavity walls. This may be responsible, in part, for patient complaints of
sensitivity and for pulpal irritation and inflammation. See, Tao, The relationship between
dentin bond strengths and dentin permeabilityDental Materials, Vol. 5, 133-39 (1989).Recently a novel priming method was developed in the laboratory of the assignee of
this invention and is sold commercially as ScotchBond 2™ Light Cure Dental Adhesive
with Scotchprep™ Dentin Primer (commercially available from 3M). This priming
method has achieved average shear strengths in vitro in excess of 20 MPa. U.S. Patent
No. 4,719,149 (Aasen et al.) describes that invention as an acid and a water-soluble film
former useful for priming hard tissue (e.g., dentin). The acid has a pKa less than or equal
to that of phenol. The calcium salt(s) of the acid are soluble in the film former. The film
former is exemplified as comprising various difunctional and monofunctional monomers
and optional cosolvents with 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate and water being preferred.Kusumoto et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,535,102 discloses an adhesive coating material
for a hard tissue comprising (1) a polymer having an acid value of 30 to 700 and 
including in recurring units a hydrophobic group and two carboxyl groups or one
carboxylic anhydride group bonded to the polymer, and (2) a polymerizable vinyl
compound or a mixture of said polymerizable vinyl compound and an organic titanate
compound.Engelbrecht et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,806,381 discloses oligomeric or prepolymeric
organic compounds that contain both polymerizable unsaturated groups and acid radicals,
their salts or their reactive-derivative radicals. The compounds adhere to
