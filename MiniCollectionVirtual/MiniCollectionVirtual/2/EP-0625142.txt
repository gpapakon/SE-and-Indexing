A process for preparing pyrrolidone and N-alkyl 
pyrrolidones from saturated or unsaturated 

1,4-dicarboxylic acids and/or their anhydrides, 
hydrogen and a primary amine or ammonia, characterised 

in that, in a suitable reactor, the dicarboxylic acid 
or its anhydride is allowed to react with hydrogen over 

a first catalyst bed and then the non-isolated 
intermediate is reacted directly with the primary amine 

or ammonia over a second, downstream catalyst bed. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that a 
copper-containing catalyst is used for the first 

catalyst bed. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that a 
silicon-containing catalyst or an aluminium phosphate 

catalyst is used for the second catalyst bed. 
A process according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
the catalyst has a zeolitic structure. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that a copper chromite catalyst is 

used for the first catalyst bed and a cation-exchanged 
zeolite o
f the X or Y type is used for the second 
catalyst bed. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the reaction takes place in the 

gas phase. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that diluents are present. 
A process according to Claim 7, characterised in that 
the diluents are gases, water or aprotic solvents.  

 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the temperature in the reactor 

over the first reactor bed is 225 to 350째C. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the temperature in the reactor 

over the second catalyst bed is 225 to 400째C. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the temperature over the first 

catalyst bed is 250 to 300째C and over the second 
catalyst bed is 260 to 340째C. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the molar ratio of the 

1,4-dicarboxylic acid or its anhydride to hydrogen is 1 
to 20 to 1 to 250. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that the molar ratio of hydrogen to 

primary amine or ammonia is 15 to 1 to 250 to 1. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that the residence time of the 

reaction partners over the particular catalyst bed is 
0.01 to 15 seconds. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 14, 
characterised in that the pressure inside the reactor 

is 0.1 to 10 bar (0.01 to 1.0 MPa).
