<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel isoquinolone 
compound having medicinal activities including an 
excellent calcium-antagonistic activity, protective 
effect of cerebralischemia, anti-cerebral edema 
activity, protective effect of neuronal damage and 
tachykinin receptor antagonizing activity. Recently, in living bodies, the role of calcium in 
various cells as a neuro transmitter has attracted 
attention, and its importance has been cleared up. 
Disruption of calcium homeostasis is considered to be a 
factor of causing, morbidly or physically, cell damage 
or cell death. In neuronal cells also, disruption of 
calcium homeostasis, in other words, neuronal damage or 
cell death in the cerebralvascular disorders such as 
cerebralischemia is caused by the release from cellular 
calcium ion (Ca²⁺) stores or influx of extracellular 
calcium ion. "Stuart A. Lipton, Advances in 
Pharmacology, 22, pp.271-297 (1991); Trends in 
Pharmacological Sciences, 10, pp397-400 (1989)". Under the above circumstances, development of new 
compounds having excellent calcium-antagonistic 
activity directly acting on neural cells as therapeutic 
and prophylactic drugs for neuronal damage such as 
cerebralischemic damage and cerebral edema in 
cerebralvascular disorders and also having excellent 
properties in respect to safety and durability or the 
like has been desired. Tachykinin is a generic term denoting a group 
of neuropeptides. In mammalian animals, substance P, 
neurokinin-A and neurokinin-B are known. It is also 
known that by binding respective receptors (neurokinin-1, 
neurokinin-2, neurokinin-3) present in the living 
body, these peptides exhibit a diversity of biological 
activities. Among them, substance P is a neuropeptide  
 
which was known for the longest time of all and studied in the 
greatest detail. Substance P is known to play a 
critical role as a neuro transmitter in both the 
peripheral and central nervous systems. This substance 
is also suspected to be involved in a variety of morbid 
states (e.g. pain, inflammation, allergy, mental 
diseases, etc.). Such being the case, for use as drugs 
for the treatment of the above-mentioned disease 
states, the development of compounds having potent 
tachykinin receptor antagonizing activity, particularly 
antagonistic activity against substance P receptor, as 
well as other favorable properties such as safety and a 
long duration of action after administration has been 
looked after in earnest. As the compounds known as having activity toward the 
substance P
