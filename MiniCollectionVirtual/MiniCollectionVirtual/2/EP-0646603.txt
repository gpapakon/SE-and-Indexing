<ABSTRACT>
An ethylene stream which contains ethane as an impurity or a propylene stream 
which contains propane as an impurity is contacted with a polymerization 

catalyst in a reactor A thereby producing a polymer product containing 
unreacted ethylene or propylene and the corresponding alkane. A gas mixture 

containing ethylene or propylene and the corresponding alkane is separated from 
the polymer product in flash zone B and purge unit C and subjected to 

adsorption at a temperature of 50 to 200°C in a bed of adsorbent forming a 
separator D which selectively adsorbs alkenes, thereby adsorbing substantially 

all of the propylene or ethylene from the gas mixture. The ethylene or propylene 
is desorbed from the adsorbent and passed to the polymerization reactor A. The 

process is operated on a low per pass conversion with recycle of unreacted 
monomer. In the system of the invention the separator D may be upstream 

(Figure 2) or downstream (Figure 1) of the polymerization reactor A.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a process and apparatus for producing 
polymers of ethylene and/or propylene and more particularly to the 
polymerization of ethylene or propylene or mixtures of ethylene and propylene to 
produce ethylene or propylene homopolymers or copolymers using as monomer 
ethylene containing ethane as an impurity or propylene containing propane as an 
impurity. Ethylene and propylene polymers are produced commercially in the gas or liquid 
phase by contacting the monomer or monomers with a suitable catalyst. The 
conditions under which the polymerization is conducted depend upon the 
particular process employed. For example, high density polyethylene is 
generally produced at low temperatures and pressures, usually in the range of 
about 75 to 90°C and 5 to 10 bar, respectively, while low density polyethylene 
is produced at high temperatures and pressures, such in the range of about 150 
to 250°C and 150 to 200 bar. Linear low density polyethylene is produced at 
moderate temperatures and pressures. The feed generally comprises high purity 
ethylene, and may include other alkenes, depending upon the product properties 
sought. Similarly, propylene polymerization is carried out at temperatures of 
about 15 to 100°C and pressures of about 25 to 50 bar. In both of the above-mentioned 
processes it is desirable that the purity of the monomeric feed used 
in the polymerization process be very high, e.g in the neighbourhood of 99.5% 
or more weight percent pure ethylene or propylene, as the case may be. The 
polymerization process is desirably continuous with the conversion per pass 
being less than 100%, and often as low as about 7 to 36%. The alkene monomer, obtained from crude oil during refining, contains 
considerable amounts of the corresponding alkane, i.e. ethane or propane. The  
 
alkene is generally separated from the propane commercially by distillation. 
Since the boiling points of ethylene and ethane, and propylene and propane are 
close together, it is difficult and costly to produce polymerization grade ethylene 
and propylene by distillation. Furthermore, since the adsorption characteristics 
of the alkenes and corresponding alkanes are similar, it has previously been very 
difficult to produce suitable ethylene and propylene polymerization feed stock by 
adsorption. The difficulty of separation of ethylene from ethane and propylene from propane 
causes a further complication with respect to polymerization processes. Since 
the polymerization is generally
