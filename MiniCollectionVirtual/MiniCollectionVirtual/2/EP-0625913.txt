Process for the decontamination and detoxification of a dwelling,
using a product based on essential oils and an atomizer for said product,

and such that each room of said dwelling is prepared so that all the
elements of furniture which compose it are accessible and that all the

exposed surfaces are treated with said product and the surfaces are then
cleaned by a simple damp wipe, comprising the following steps:


all the outer openings of said ram are closed and all the
elements of furniture to be treated are exposed to the ambient air of this

room;
said product is diffused as an aerosol and all the volume of air
of the room in question is thus treated with the mist emitted and composed

of said particles of product;
diffusion of said product is then stopped, the room is
maintained closed for a given duration and said room is aired,

characterised in that:
said product is diffused as a true aerosol from the centre of the
room in particles of 0.2 to 2 µm maximum for a determined and sufficient

period of time, defined as a function of the volume of said room, and as a
function of the flowrate diffused by the
 atomizer, such that the quantity of
products in suspension in said volume of room is at least one ml/m
3
 and
that the mist thus emitted decontaminates and detoxifies the particles of

dust in the dwelling.
Process for decontamination and detoxification of a dwelling
according to Claim 1, characterised in that said product used is a rich

formulation of ten constituents, and which contains in particular essential
oils such as essential oil of lilac, essential oil of lemon, essential oil of

citronella and aromatic essences such as terpineol and phenolic derivatives
of natural origin, such as benzoic acid, salol and thymol and antiseptic

products such as triclosan, all being in solution in an aliphatic solvent
likewise of natural origin.
Application of products based on essential oils diffused in the
rooms of a dwelling to treat the accessible surfaces thereof, characterized

in that said product is used for detoxicating the particles of dust in the 
ambient air, by action in gaseous phase, thanks to the diffusion as true

aerosol of particles of 0.2 to 2 µm for several hours.
Application of products based on essential oils according to
Claim 3, characterised in that said product used is composed of essential

oils such as essential oil of lilac, essential oil of lemon, essential oil of
citronella, aromatic essences such as terpineol and phenolic derivatives of

natural origin, such as benzoic acid, salol and thymol and antiseptic
products such as triclosan, all being in solution in an aliphatic solvent

likewise of natural origin.
Application of products based on essential oils according to any
one of Claims 3 to 4, characterised in that the quantity of said product

diffused in the ambient air of said dwelling is at least equal to 1 ml/m
3
.
