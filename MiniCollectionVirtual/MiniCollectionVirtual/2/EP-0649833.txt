<ABSTRACT>
Preparation of anthraquinone imide compounds by condensation of anthraquinone compounds containing at least one primary amino group with halogenated aromatics or of halogenated anthraquinone compounds with primary aromatic amines in the presence of a copper catalyst and of an acid-binding agent in an organic solvent by using an alkyl benzoate as organic solvent.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing anthraquinone-amine 
compounds by condensation of anthraquinone compounds 

which contain at least one primary amino group with 
halogenated aromatic compounds or of halogenated anthraquinone 

compounds with primary aromatic amines in the 
presence of a copper catalyst and of an acid acceptor in 

an organic solvent, wherein an alkyl benzoate is used as 
organic solvent. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein methyl 
benzoate is used as organic solvent. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
condensation is carried out in the presence of an oxidizing 

agent. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
which is used to prepare anthraquinone-amine compounds of 

the general formula I 

 
in which the variables have the following meaning: 


R
a phenyl radical, an anthraquinone, benzanthrone, 
anthanthrone, pyranthrone, dibenzanthrone, isodibenzanthrone, 

anthraquinoneacridone, flavanthrone, 
fluoranthene, dibenzpyrenequinone radical or the 

radical of a condensate of these aromatic compounds, 
where the said radicals can carry substituents 

customary for vat dyes;  
 
X
halogen, hydroxyl, amino, C₁-C₄-alkylamino, C₁-C₄-alkanoylamino, 
benzoylamino whose benzoyl radical 

can be substituted by halogen or C₁-C₄-alkyl, or 

C₁-C₄-alkyl; 
m
0 to 4, where the X radicals can be identical or 
different when m ≧ 2; 
n
1 to 4.
