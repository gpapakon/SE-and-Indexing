<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for preparing medical implants for use in human and veterinary medicine. An implant with micropores or macropores is produced in such a way that the cavities are open-celled and communicate with the environment and the cavities are evacuated and have a gas pressure which is lower than the atmospheric outside pressure. If such implants are contained in a packaging that can be closed in air-tight fashion, they may be coated with drug-containing solutions via an access opening. The pores readily absorb the drugs and release them in the body tissue after insertion of the implants therein.

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing an implant for use in human 
and veterinary medicine, characterized in that the implant is 

provided with micro- and/or macro-pores extending to the 
surface of the implant and the cavities formed by the pores 

are evacuated in a container, such that they exhibit a gas 
pressure below external atmospheric pressure. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the implant is arranged inside a packaging container in the 

evacuated state. 
A process according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the gas pressure in the packaging container containing the 

implant is set lower than 0.3 bar. 
An implant, produced according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the gas pressure in 

the cavities in the implant member is lower than 0.3 bar. 
A process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the container or packaging 

container is air-tightly sealable. 
A process according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the container or packaging container is provided with a 

perforatable membrane and/or an access valve. 
An implant according to claim 4 combined with 
packaging, characterized in that the container is air-tightly 

sealable and provided with a perforatable membrane and/or an 
access valve.
