<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a DNA molecule containing intron sequences and encoding a human protein which is, depending on the site of action, called Bile Salt-Stimulated Lipase (BSSL) or Carboxyl Ester Lipase (CEL). The DNA molecule is advantageously used in the production of recombinant human BSSL/CEL, preferably by means of production in transgenic non-human mammals. The recombinant human BSSL/CEL can be used as a constituent of infant formulas used for feeding infants as a substitute for human milk, or in the manufacture of medicaments against e.g. fat malabsorption, cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DNA sequences used in the production of recombinant human BSSL/CEL in transgenic non-human mammals, and the produced BSSL/CEL used in infant formulas.TECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a DNA molecule containing intron sequences and encoding a human protein which is, depending on the site of action, called Bile Salt-Stimulated Lipase (BSSL) or Carboxyl Ester Lipase (CEL) . The DNA molecule is advantageously used in the production of recombinant human BSSL/CEL, preferably by means of production in transgenic non- human mammals . The recombinant human BSSL/CEL can be used as a constituent of infant formulas used for feeding infants as a substitute .for human milk, or in the manufacture of medicaments against e.g. fat malabsorption, cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONHydrolysis of dietary lipidsDietary lipids are an important source of energy. The energy-rich triacylglycerols constitute more than 95% of these lipids. Some of the lipids, e.g. certain fatty acids and the fat-soluble vitamins, are essential dietary constituents. Before gastro-intestinal absorption the triacylglycerols as well as the minor components, i.e. esterified fat-soluble vitamins and cholesterol, and diacylphosphatidylglycerols, require hydrolysis of the ester bonds to give rise to less hydrophobic, absorbable products. These reactions are catalyzed by a specific group of enzymes called lipases .In the human adult the essential lipases involved are considered to be Gastric Lipase, Pancreatic Colipase- Dependent Lipase (hydrolysis of tri- and 

diacylglycerols) , Pancreatic Phospholipase A2 (hydrolysis of diacylphosphatidylglycerols) and Carboxylic Ester Lipase (CEL) (hydrolysis of cholesteryl- and fat soluble vitamin esters) . In the breast-fed newborn, Bile Salt-Stimulated Lipase (BSSL) plays an essential part in the hydrolysis of several of the above mentioned lipids. Together with bile salts the products of lipid digestion form mixed micelles from which absorption occurs.Bile Salt-Stimulated LipaseThe human lactating mammary gland synthesizes and secretes with the milk a Bile Salt-Stimulated Lipase (BSSL) (Blackberg et al. , 1987) that, after specific activation by primary bile salts, contributes to the breast-fed infant's endogenous capacity of intestinal fat digestion. This enzyme, which accounts for approximately 1% of total milk protein (Blackberg & Hernell, 1981) , is not degraded during passage with the milk through the stomach, and in duodenal contents it is protected by bile

2. A DNA molecule according to claim 1 which is shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 in the Sequence Listing.
3. An analogue of the DNA molecule according to claim 2 which contains intron sequences and which hybridizes with the DNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 in the Sequence Listing or a specific part thereof under stringent hybridization conditions.
4. A replicable expression vector which carries and is capable of mediating the expression of a DNA molecule according to any one of claims 1-3, encoding human BSSL/CEL.
5. A vector according to claim 4 capable of encoding biologically funtional BSSL/CEL and containing regulatory elements directing expression to the mammary gland of a non-human mammal.
6. A vector according to claim 4 which is the vector pS452 (DSM 7499) .
7. A cell derived from a multicellular organism and harbouring a vector according to any one of claims 4-6.

9. A mammalian expression system, comprising a hybrid gene which is expressible in the mammary gland of an adult female of a non-human mammal harbouring said hybrid gene, so that human BSSL/CEL is produced when the hybrid gene is expressed, said hybrid gene being produced by inserting a DNA molecule according to any one of claims 1-3 into a gene regulating a milk protein gene of a non-human mammal.
10. A hybrid gene as defined in claim 9.
11. A mammalian cell harbouring an expression system as defined in claim 9.
