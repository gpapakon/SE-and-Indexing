<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for treating a liquid, in particular an aqueous liquid, preferably to avoid, decrease or eliminate deposits and/or corrosion in pipes or vessels through which the treated liquid flows, including at least one liquid treatment route, to which is assigned at least one electrode preferably electrically insulated from the liquid treatment route. The object underlying the invention is to develop an apparatus of the generic type mentioned so that with it, changing capacity requirements can be reacted to in an economical manner. This object is achieved according to the invention by a plurality of liquid treatment routes which are essentially parallel to each other being able to be optionally combined together.
