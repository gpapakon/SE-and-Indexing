<ABSTRACT>
Method for producing a sanitary tub (1) having a tub support (2) made of a foam plastic and, bonded thereto, on the side which is used, a tub shell (3) made of a thermoformable thermoplastic. The following method steps are carried out: production of the tub support (2), heating of a blank in sheet form for the moulding of the tub shell (3) by way of malleable shaping and use of the tub support as a mould for the tub shell in a thermoforming press. The thermoforming operation is carried out using a thermoforming ram (4) adapted to the tub shell to be moulded. Following the thermoforming operation, the thermoforming ram (4) is held by a bonding pressure until there is an adequate bond between the tub shell (3) and the tub support (2). The heating of the blank in sheet form takes place up to the temperature which is required as the bonding temperature for the adequate bonding of the tub shell (3) with the tub support (2).

A process for producing a tub (1) for the sanitary domain having a tub support (2) 
made of a foamed synthetic material and having a tub basin (3) which is attached thereto on 

the side of use and is made of a thermoformable, synthetic thermoplastic material, wherein 
the tub support (2) is used in a thermoforming press as a female mould with a base and 

sidewalls for the tub basin (3), and a heated blank in sheet form is placed on the tub support 
(2) and is drawn into the tub support (2) by a moulding thermoforming pressure ram, 

characterised by the following process steps: 

a) placing the heated blank on a clamping frame associated with the tub support 
(2) and effecting the thermoforming operation using a moulding 

thermoforming pressure ram, 
b) holding the thermoforming pressure ram with a moulding pressure following 
the thermoforming operation until the tub basin (3) is satisfactorily bonded to 

the base and the sidewalls of the tub support (2), 
 
wherein contact surfaces which are free from adhesive are employed between the tub support 

(2) and the tub basin (3) and wherein heating of the sheet-form blank is effected up to the 
temperature which is necessary within the context of feature b) as the joining temperature for 

a satisfactory bond of the tub basin (3) to the tub support (2). 
A process according to claim 1, wherein a tub support (2) is employed which, as a 
female mould, comprises formations at least in the region of the sidewalls, which formations 

produce a moulding pressure in cooperation with the thermoforming pressure ram. 
A process according to either one of claims 1 or 2, wherein a foamed polystyrene 
synthetic material is used for the tub support (2).  

 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein a polyacrylic synthetic 
material is used for the tub basin (3). 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein a polystyrene material for 
the tub support (2) is paired with a polyacrylic material for the tub basin (3). 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the tub support (2) is 
formed by moulding with foaming. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the sheet-form blank is 
heated to a joining temperature which is above the typical thermoforming temperature for the 

material. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein a thermoforming pressure 
ram is employed with which cooling of the tub basin (3) is effected during the joining pressing 

operation. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the joining moulding 
pressure is maintained for about 3 to 10 minutes, preferably about 5 minutes. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 9, wherein the joining moulding 
pressure is maintained at a specific pressing force per unit area in the range from 5 to 10 

N/cm
2
, preferably about 7.5 N/cm
2
. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 10, wherein contact surfaces which are 
free from bonding agent are employed between the tub support (2) and the tub basin (3).
