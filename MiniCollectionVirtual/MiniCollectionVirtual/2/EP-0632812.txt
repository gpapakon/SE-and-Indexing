<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel compounds useful 
as cardiovascular agents, to novel pharmaceutical 
compositions and to a novel method of treating 
cardiovascular disorders. Endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) is a 
labile humoral agent which is part of a cascade of 
interacting agents involved in the relaxation of 
vascular smooth muscle. EDRF is thus important in the 
control of vascular resistance to blood flow and in 
the control of blood pressure. Some vasodilators act 
by causing EDRF to be released from endothelial cells. 
(See Furchgott, Ann.Rev.Pharmacol.Toxicol. 24, 175-197, 
1984.) In 1987, Palmer et al., presented 
evidence that EDRF is identical to the simple 
molecule, nitric oxide, NO (Nature 317, 524-526, 
1987), though more recently, that conclusion has been 
challenged (Myers et al., Nature, 345, 161-163, 1990).  
 It has been hypothesized for years that many 
nitrovasodilators, which mimic the effect of EDRF, 
like glyceryl trinitrate, amyl nitrite, NaNO2 and 
sodium nitroprusside (SNP), do so by virtue of their 
conversion to a common moiety, namely NO, which is 
also a vasodilator. (See Kruszyna et al., Tox. & 
Appl. Pharmacol.,91, 429-438, 1987; Ignarro, FASEB J. 
3, 31-36, 1989; and Ignarro et al., J. Pharmacol. 
Exper. Therapeutics 218(3), 739-749, 1981.) Numerous nitric oxide-nucleophile complexes have 
been described, e.g., Drago, ACSAdv. Chem. serv., Vol. 
36, p. 143-149 (1962). See also R. Longhi and R.S. 
Drago, Inorg. Chem. 2 85, (1963). Some of these 
complexes are known to evolve nitric oxide on heating 
or hydrolysis, e.g., Hansen, et al., IARC SCI. PUBL., 
Vol. 41, p. 21-29 (1982). Evidence that nitric oxide is released from the 
endothelial cells and is responsible for the 
relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle, and hence 
the control of blood pressure, has resulted in the 
development of artificial agents that can deliver 
nitric oxide in vivo. A very important class of such 
agents is the nitric oxide-nucleophile complexes. 
Recently, a method for treating cardiovascular 
disorders in a mammal with certain nitric oxide-nucleophile 
complexes has been disclosed in U.S. 
4,954,526.  
 The cardiovascular agents described in U.S. 
4,954,526 are complexes formed from nitric oxide and 
primary amines, and esters, ethers or other 
derivatives of the resulting adducts. These compounds 
spontaneously release nitric oxide in vivo, and it is 
this release which accounts for their biological 
activity. While these nitric oxide-nucleophile 
complexes have been found to
