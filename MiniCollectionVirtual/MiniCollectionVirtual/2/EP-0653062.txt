<ABSTRACT>
A method combining the techniques of immunoaffinity separation and continuous flow centrifugal separation is provided for selective separation of a nucleated heterogeneous cell population from a heterogeneous cell mixture. The heterogeneous cell mixture is intimately contacted to promote binding thereto by particles having attached a substance that actively binds to a specific desired type of cell out of the cell mixture. The particles are selected so that the sedimentation velocity of the particle/cell conjugate differs sufficiently from those of other cells in the cell mixture to allow its separation by means of a continuous flow cell separator. The method rapidly processes large volumes of cell mixture with the high accuracy expected of immunoaffinity separation and can be used to separate, for example, various types of leukocytes from whole blood, bone marrow concentrate, or a peripheral blood stem cell concentrate; or precursors of lymphokine activated killer cells, tumor infiltrating lymphocyte cells, or activated killer monocytes from lymphocyte or monocyte cell concentrates or from a tissue cell preparation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a system for
separating a specific cell population from a heterogeneous
cell mixture. An embodiment of the invention concerns a
closed, sterile continuous flow process for separating a
nucleated heterogeneous cell population from a large volume
of heterogeneous cell mixture in a relatively short time.In the field of cell separation, it is common to separate
cells from plasma in blood and also to separate by
centrifugation various types of cells such as red cells from
white cells, and the like. Centrifugation segregates cells
according to their differing specific gravities. However,
there is often a need to separate from a suspension cells
having specific gravity only slightly different from those
of other cells in the suspension. If the cells are of nearly
equal specific gravity, they may not be separated by
centrifugation.For example, it may be desirable to isolate various types
of leukocytes from a bone marrow concentrate or a peripheral
blood cell concentrate. Or, it may be desirable to perform
selective separation of tumor cells from a bone marrow
concentrate, for example, hematopoietic progenitor cells. It
may be desirable to selectively separate specific T-lymphocyte
subset populations (helper-inducer or suppressor-cytotoxic T-lymphocytes)
from a lymphocyte concentrate that is prepared
using a blood cell separator. Additionally, it may be desirable to selectively separate
precursors of lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells, tumor
infiltration lymphocyte (TIL) cells, or activated killer
monocytes, from lymphocyte or monocyte cell concentrates or
from a tissue cell preparation.By current techniques of the prior art, such as Sauer,
et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,710,472, magnetic separations in
significant quantities of individual subsets of cells from
larger populations became possible. This, in turn, opens up
new vistas of research and therapeutic techniques, making use
of the purified cell populations that may be obtained.Another current practice in the field of cell separation,
utilizes sheet membranes, hollow fibers, or packed beds of
either beads or particles having physically adsorbed or
covalently attached chemicals or biochemicals, such as
antibodies. By these means certain populations of cells are
selectively separated from whole blood, blood components, bone
marrow, tissue digests, or other types of cellular
suspensions. These devices are designed to allow continuous
inflow and return of the cell mixtures. When used to process
blood, these devices usually operate
