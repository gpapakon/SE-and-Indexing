<ABSTRACT>
Catalyst composition including copper chloride, magnesium chloride and potassium chloride which are deposited on an alumina, usable in particular for the oxychlorination of ethylene to 1,2-dichloroethane. In the processes for oxychlorination of ethylene with oxygen in a fluid bed, this catalyst composition makes it possible to obtain an excellent yield of 1,2-dichloroethane without causing the deposition of soiling on the surface of the tubes of the bundle of the heat exchanger placed in the reactor.
