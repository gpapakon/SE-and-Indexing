<ABSTRACT>
A process for the recycling of cured amino resins in which cured amino resins, optionally containing fillers, are treated with an aqueous sulphite, hydrogen sulphite or disulphite solution and the resultant low-molecular-weight degradation products are employed in chemical processes. The invention also relates to the low-molecular-weight degradation products of cured amino resins which are obtainable by this process, and to their use for the coating of mouldings, for the tanning of leather and hides, and for the production of mouldings containing or comprising cured amino resins.

<CLAIMS>
A process for recycling cured melamine resins,
wherein cured melamine resins, which may contain fillers,

are reacted with an aqueous sulfite, hydrogen sulfite or
disulfite solution to form a clear solution out of which

melamine and/or water-insoluble melamine derivatives
precipitate as the reaction proceeds, which are removed

from the solution after the end of the reaction and
cooling to room temperature and are used in chemical

processes.
A low molecular weight degradation product of
cured melamine resins, obtainable by reacting cured

melamine resins with an aqueous sulfite, hydrogen sulfite
or disulfite solution so as to form a clear solution out

of which melamine and/or water-insoluble melamine derivatives
precipitate as the reaction proceeds, which are

removed from the solution after the end of the reaction
and cooling to room temperature.
Use of a low molecular weight degradation product
as claimed in claim 2 for coating moldings.
Use of a low molecular weight degradation product
as claimed in claim 2 for tanning hides and skins.
Use of a low molecular weight degradation product

as claimed in claim 2 for the production of moldings
which contain cured melamine resins or consist thereof.
