Handrail run-in part for the handrail of an 
escalator or moving walkway or the like, which is arranged 

in the lower balustrade region and is formed by two individual 
parts (3, 4) that can be placed round the handrail 

(2), characterized in that the individual parts (3, 4) can 
be located with respect to each other by way of projections 

(5, 6) which are provided on at least one of the parts and 
engage in corresponding recesses (7, 8) of the other part 

(4, 3), and in that each part (3, 4) has a resiliently 
deformable bellows section (11) which is in each case 

connected to a retaining element (10). 
Handrail run-in part according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that each part (3, 4) has at least one 

projection (5, 6) which points in the direction of the 
other part (4, 3) and which engages in a corresponding 

recess (7, 8) of the other part (4, 3). 
Handrail run-in part according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the projections (5, 6) are provided 

in different planes of the two parts (3, 4), especially 
lying opposite one another. 
Handrail run-in part according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the respective bellows section (11) 

is connected to the corresponding retaining element (10) by 
vulcanization. 
Handrail run-in part according to Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the bellows sections (11) taper 

conically, starting from the corresponding retaining 
element (10). 
Handrail run-in part according to Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the projections (5, 6) and the 

recesses (7, 8) are vulcanized on in the respective bellows 
section (11), especially in the region of the free end face 

(12) of the bellows. 
Handrail run-in part according to Claims 1 to 6,  
 

characterized in that the projections (5, 6) taper 
conically in the direction of the other part (4, 3) and the 

recesses (7, 8) have a corresponding complementary profile. 
Handrail run-in part according to Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the respective retaining element (10) 

has an angled cross-section, the limbs (13), remote from 
the bellows sections (11), of the retaining elements (10) 

having through bores (14) or the like, and being arranged 
to be connected to one another by way of at least one 

intermediate element, especially by screwing.
