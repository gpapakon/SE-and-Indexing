<ABSTRACT>
A pre-baked edible product such as bread is prepared by
baking the product until raising is complete. Hot flowing

air is deflected away from the product to ensure that the
raised product coagulates into the risen volume without

significant browning of the product surface. A baffle
frame 1 is disposed within a flat baking tray A to deflect

heat from the product during pre-baking.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to bakery products and in 
particular to a method of producing pre-baked foods 
suitable for cold storage or freezing prior to completion 
of baking. In the well-known process for preparing baked foods such as 
breads and confectionary, the ingredients are mixed 
together with a raising agent. Commonly used raising 
agents are yeast, bread soda and baking powder. These 
different agents act in different ways to achieve the same 
result, namely to provide small bubbles of gas within the 
dough or batter. When the dough or batter is placed in a 
hot oven, the trapped gas expands and, consequently, the 
product rises. This phenomenon is known as "oven spring" 
and it typically produces a 30% volume increase in the 
first few minutes of baking. As the baking continues, the 
gluten in the flour used in the mixture stretches around 
the bubbles of gas, until eventually it loses its 
elasticity and the product is set or coagulated in the 
shape it has assumed. Continued baking after this point 
serves to give the product the crustiness and/or brown 
colouration to which the consumer is accustomed. Products such as bread and confectionery can be stored in 
freezers. Once thawed, fully cooked goods of this type 
frequently do not have the same aesthetic appeal as freshly 
baked products. Furthermore, some products of this type 
are preferably eaten warm or hot and reheating of a 
fully-baked product can result in dehydration and surface 
burning. For these reasons, a partially cooked bakery 
product is desirable so that it can be taken from cold 
storage and the baking can be completed in a domestic oven. 
In this way, the consumer is provided with a product having  
 
all the desirable organoleptic characteristics of a 
freshly-baked product. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
process for preparing a pre-baked product, the cooking of 
which can be completed after a period of cold storage. 
It is also an object of the invention to provide apparatus 
for use in the production of pre-baked products. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for 
preparing a pre-baked product such as for example bread or 
confectionery, the process comprising preparing an edible 
mixture including a raising agent, pre-baking the edible 
mixture in an oven at a temperature and for a time 
sufficient for the product to rise characterised by 
deflecting the heat away from the product during the 
pre-baking step while continuing baking for a time

A process for preparing a pre-baked product such as for 
example bread or confectionery, the process comprising 

preparing an edible mixture including a raising agent, 
pre-baking the edible mixture in an oven at a temperature 

and for a time sufficient for the product to rise 
characterised by deflecting the heat away from the product 

during the pre-baking step while continuing baking for a 
time sufficient to set the product in its risen volume 

without substantially browning the exterior surface of the 
product. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 characterised by 
deflecting the heat by baffle means (1) which substantially 

prevents hot flowing air from flowing about the surface of 
the product. 
A process as claimed in claim 2 in which the baffle 
means (1) is provided with at least one deflecting plate 

(5) for diverting hot flowing air away from the product. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3 
characterised by pre-baking the edible mixture at a 

temperature of about 175°C for about 22 minutes, until 

raising is complete and then at about 150°C for about 
another 6 minutes to set the product in the risen volume. 
A baffle frame for use in a process for preparing a 
pre-baked food product such as for example bread or 

confectionary including a raising agent, comprising a wall 
(2,3) forming a frame (1) for substantially surrounding the 

sides of the product during pre-baking, the height of the 
wall (2,3) being at least substantially equal to the height 

of the risen product, so that heat is deflected away from 
 

the product during pre-baking to enable the product to set 
in its risen volume without substantial browning of its 

exterior surface. 
A baffle frame according to claim 5 in which the wall 
(2,3) includes an air deflecting plate (5) associated 

therewith for diverting hot flowing air away from the 
surface of the product. 
A baffle frame according to claim 6, in which the wall 
(2,3) is upstanding and comprises an upper side wall (2) 

and a lower side wall (3) with the air deflecting plate (5) 
located therebetween, and in which the upper side wall (2) 

assists in restricting the movement of hot flowing air over 
the product. 
A baffle frame according to claim 7 in which a gap is 
provided between the upper side wall (2) and the air 

deflecting plate (5). 
A baffle frame according to any of claims 5 to 8, in 
which the frame (1) is formed integrally with a tray (A) 

on which the product is placed for pre-baking. 
A pre-baked food product such as for example bread or 
confectionary, characterised in that the product is raised 

and set in its raised volume but its exterior surface is 
substantially unbrowned.
