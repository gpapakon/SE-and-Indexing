<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermosetting powder 
coating compositions containing flow modifiers. Typical powder coating compositions contain a flow modifier 
or a flow control agent to enhance the rheology of the coating 
composition and provide for smoother, better looking coatings. 
Common flow modifiers include low glass transition temperature 
acrylics such as poly(2-ethylhexyl acrylate). See in this regard 
U.S. 3,787,340 to Labana et al. Powder coating compositions are widely used in a variety of 
industrial applications which require their use with associated 
coatings. For example, the powder coating compositions are often 
used as primer surfacers or chipguard primers. In this instance, 
they are topcoated with typical finishing coat compositions and the 
flow control agents such as those mentioned above adversely affect 
the intercoat adhesion between the topcoat and the powder primer 
surfacer. In addition, powder coatings are often applied as chipcoat 
primers over uncured, dehydrated electrodeposited coatings. See, for 
example, U.S. 4,804,581. In this application, the chipguard primer 
is only applied to a portion of the electrodeposited coating, usually 
in the areas that are subjected to stone chipping, i.e., rocker 
panels and wheel wells. The composite coating is then co-cured in 
one step and topcoated with a conventional finishing coat. In 
applying the chipguard primer to only a portion of the dehydrated, 
uncured electrodeposited primer, there is an area of overspray where 
the powder coating composition impacts the electrodeposited primer in 
areas other than that to be coated. When the chipguard primer 
contains conventional flow control additives such as those described 
above, severe cratering of the electrodeposited primer often results.  
 In accordance with the present invention, a thermosetting 
powder coating composition comprising: 
(a) from 95.0 to 99.99 percent by weight based on weight of 
resin solids of a curable particulate resinous material 
and (b) from about 0.01 to 5 percent by weight based on weight 
of resin solids of a flow control agent  
is provided. The flow control agent is a copolymer of polymerizable 
ethylenically unsaturated monomers comprising 40 to 80 percent by 
weight based on weight of polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated 
monomers of an alkyl acrylate or methacrylate containing from 6 to 20 
carbon atoms in the alkyl group and from 10 to 50 percent by weight 
based on weight of polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers
