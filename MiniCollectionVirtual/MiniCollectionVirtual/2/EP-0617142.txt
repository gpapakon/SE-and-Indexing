<ABSTRACT>
A silica thin film is formed by 
establishing an atmospheric pressure glow 

discharge beam plasma using an inert gas as a 
main gas, feeding a silane compound, typically 

tetramethoxysilane in vapor form to the plasma, 
and depositing a silica thin film on a 

substrate, typically a plastic film. The method 
enables to deposit a silica thin film of quality 

on various substrates in the ambient atmosphere, 
at relatively low temperatures and within a 

short time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates to methods for depositing a 
homogeneous silica thin film on substrates. Silica thin films are not only useful as 
insulating films and passivation films in the 
LSI field, but also effective in imparting 
resistance against wear, impact, corrosion and 
heat to various substrates. They are also used 
for decoration purposes. There are known a number of techniques for 
producing such silica thin films including a 
traditional technique of melting silica powder 
followed by forming and cooling. Great 
advances have recently been made in this field as 
seen from the development of new techniques such 
as chemical vapor deposition and sol-gel 
techniques. These latest techniques are  
 
advantageous in forming homogeneous thin films 
of high purity on desired substrates. Among these, a conventional chemical gas 
phase deposition technique using a plasma is 
effective for forming silica thin films, but 
requires very high temperatures which can cause 
serious damages to substrates. The substrate 
which can be used in this technique is limited 
to a highly heat resistant one. A technique 
using a low-temperature plasma is known to 
avoid such inconvenience. Plasma generating 
means and a substrate must be kept in vacuum 
before plasma treatment can be carried out. 
Then the low - temperature plasma technique has 
problems that a large size apparatus and a 
number of peripheral equipment are necessary and 
continuous treatment of substrates is difficult. 
The sol-gel technique also has problems 
including a long time taken for gel drying and 
difficulty to form a precise thin film because 
pinholes and cracks occur and voids are left 
during volatilization of the solvent. Silica-deposited plastic films, wherein a 
silica thin film is formed on a plastic film 
surface are known, and useful for food wrapping and  
 
other packaging materials because they are 
transparent and highly resistant against air and 
moisture permeation as disclosed in US-A-3,442,686 
and Japanese Patent Publication 
(JP-B) No. 12953/1978. Silica is evaporated or 
deposited onto a plastic film surface typically 
by induction heating, resistance heating, 
sputtering, or electron beam heating. However, since plastic films have little 
resistance to heat, silica evaporation 
must be carried out in vacuum in order to 
avoid damage to the plastic films. This again 
imposes necessity for a number of peripheral 
equipment, including a high power vacuum system, 
and renders continuous treatment of plastic 
films

film comprising the steps of: 

   creating an atmospheric pressure glow 
discharge beam plasma using an inert gas as a 

main gas, 
   feeding a silane compound of the general 

formula (1): 
R1nSi(OR²)4-n   (1) 

wherein R¹ is a hydrogen atom, lower alkyl or 
alkoxy group, R² is a lower alkyl group, and n is 

an integer of 0 to 4, in vapor form to the 
plasma, and 

   depositing a silica thin film on a 
substrate.

substrate is a plastic film and said silica thin 

film is 0.01 to 1 µm thick. 
The method of claim 1 or 2 which 
further comprises the step of feeding hydrogen 

gas at the same time as the silane compound. 
The method of claim 3 wherein the feed

the feed rate by volume of the silane compound 
 

vapor.
