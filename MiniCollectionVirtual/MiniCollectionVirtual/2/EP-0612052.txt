<ABSTRACT>
This is a marking device (12A, 12B) of the type including a support (14) suitable for accommodating an identification message, and, made in a single piece with this support (14), for fastening the assembly to an element to be marked, by means of a fixing connector (15). According to the invention, two marking devices (12A, 12B) are twinned detachably with one another, which allows a combined composition of identification messages which they are to carry. Application, especially, to identifying both of the ends of the same electrical installation cable.

<CLAIMS>
A marking device comprising a support (10) for receiving an 
identification message and, in one piece with said support (14), for 

fastening the assembly to an element to be marked, at least one fixing 
base (15), characterised in that it is detachably paired with another 

marking device (12A, 12B). 
A marking device according to claim 1 characterised in that it 
is detachably paired with another identical marking device (12A, 12B). 
A marking device according to either one of claims 1 and 2 
characterised in that it is connected in one piece to the other marking 

device (12A, 12B) by a frangible attachment (29). 
A marking device according to claim 3 characterised in that 
the frangible attachment (29) occurs at the location of the fixing base 

(15). 
A marking device according to either one of claims 3 and 4 
characterised in that the frangible attachment (29) constitutes a hinge 

zone permitting the two marking devices (12A, 12B) to be arranged in 
mutually superposed relationship. 
A marking device according to any one of claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that it longitudinally has a flat surface (29) by way of 

which the other marking device (12A, 12B) can be applied thereto. 
A marking device according to claim 6 characterised in that, 
its support (14) being an elongate support of which the edges 

longitudinally form two shoulders (18) to which a marker (13) can be 
fitted transversely by simple latching engagement for making up at least 

one identification message, said shoulders (18) extend at a spacing from 

its surface (27).  
 
A marking device according to any one of claims 1 to 7 
characterised in that, its support (14) being an elongate support of 

which the edges longitudinally form two shoulders (18) to which a marker 
(13) can be fitted transversely by simple latching engagement for making 

up at least one identification message, the cross-section of the upper 
surface of said support is generally polygonal. 
A marking device according to any one of claims 1 to 8 
characterised in that, its fixing base (15) comprising two holes (21) for 

a clamping collar (23) to pass therethrough, said holes (21) extend in 
respect of height in the actual thickness of said fixing base (15) in 

such a way that they are transversely in continuity with each other. 
A marking device according to claim 9 characterised in that 
the two holes (21) in its fixing base (15) being defined by three bar 

portions (24) which, parallel to each other, are parallel to the support 
(14), the central bar portion (24) is displaced in respect of height in 

relation to the end bar portions (24) and at the side of the latter it is 
longitudinally provided in projecting relationship with a rib (26). 
A marking device according to any one of claims 1 to 10 
characterised in that there is a fixing base (15) at each of the ends of 

the support (14). 
A marking device according to claims 3 and 11 in combination 
characterised in that there is a frangible attachment (29) for each of 

the fixing bases (15) and it extends generally parallel to the support 
(14). 
A marking device according to claims 3 and 11 in combination 
characterised in that there is a frangible attachment (29) only for one 

of the fixing bases (15) and it extends generally perpendicularly to the 
support (14).  

 
A process for using a marking device (12A, 12B) with which 
there is paired another marking device (12A, 12B) according to any one of 

claims 1 to 13 characterised in that, relating to positioning on said 
marking devices (12A, 12B) for making up an identification message of 

markers (13) to be latched in position, which are initially disposed 
detachably in a string (33), the marking devices (12A, 12B) are arranged 

in mutually superposed relationship with their respective supports (14) 
disposed back-to-back, the assembly is applied transversely to the string 

(33) of markers (13) and there is imparted thereto a relative winding 
movement over a revolution with respect thereto, with, in each half-revolution, 

the deposit of a marker (13) on the support (14) of the 
marking device (12A, 12B) then in contact with said string (33) of 

markers (13). 
A marker comprising a central portion (30) and two lateral 
wings (31) each having in projecting relationship towards each other on 

their internal surface a ridge (32) for latching engagement thereof on a 
marking device (12A, 12B) comprising for that purpose a support (14) 

whose edges form shoulders (18) for such latching engagement, 
characterised in that, for carrying out the process according to claim 

14, its two lateral wings (31) also each have in projecting relationship 
on their internal surface a ridge (40) of generally convex cross-section. 
A marker according to claim 15 characterised in that the 
lower surface of its central portion (30) comprises in cross-section a 

profile which is different from that of the cross-section of the support 
(14) of the marking device (12A, 12B). 
A marking device according to claim 1 characterised in that 
it is paired with another marking device (12A, 12B) by way of a cuttable 

zone (29) of smaller thickness.  
 
A marking device according to claim 17 characterised in that 
the other marking device (12A, 12B) is of a different type. 
A marking device according to any one of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that it is formed by a portion of a shaped member (45A, 

45B). 
A marking device according to claim 19 characterised in that 
the shaped member (45A, 45B) to which it belongs is pre-cut into a 

plurality of portions. 
A marking device according to either one of claims 19 and 20 
characterised in that the other marking device (12A, 12B) with which it 

is paired is also formed by a portion of a shaped member (45A, 45B) and
