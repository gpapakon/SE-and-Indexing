<ABSTRACT>
Thiols, or thiolate salts, disulfides and sulfenamides or certain pyrazines are effective accelerators in the sulfur vulcanization of rubber. These compounds, based on 2-pyrazine, show improved rates of vulcanization compared with known sulfenamide accelerators.

 2-PYRAZINE DERIVATIVES AND THEIR USE IN RUBBERFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to certain pyrazine thiols, disulfides and sulfenamides and to their use in rubber.BACKGROUND A number of heterocyclic sulfenamides, thiols and disulfides have been well known, as has been their use in the vulcanization of rubber. The best known and most widely used are based on benzothiazole. Thus, the benzothiazole sulfenamides, such as N-t-butyl-2-benzo¬ thiazole sulfenamide (TBBS) and N-cyclohexyl-2- benzothiazole sulfenamide (CBS) have become standard accelerators of vulcanization. Similarly, the thiol derivative, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) and the disulfide derivative, 2,2'-benzothiazole disulfide ( BTS) , are standards of the industry.To a lesser degree, other N-heterocycles have been suggested as the basis for sulfenamides. For example, British Patent 795,174 describes a process for making a large variety of sulfonamide compounds for use as diuretics and antibacterial agents in which the sulfenamide equivalent is first made as an intermediate. Twenty-six different basic heterocycles are suggested, and a wide variety of substituents and fused ring variations are included, as well.Similarly, British Patent 1,342,046 discloses a process for making heterocyclic sulfenamides, based on diazine, triazine and pyridine thiols, encompassing an unlimited number of possible compounds, suggested to be effective vulcanization accelerators for rubber.SUMMARY O' THE INVENTION It has now been found that thiols, disulfides and sulfenamides based on certain pyrazyl moieties are 

particularly effective accelerators for the vulcani¬ zation of natural and synthetic rubber. More particularly, 2-pyrazine thiols, disulfides and sulfenamides have been found to have superior accelerating effect on the vulcanization of natural and synthetic rubber, compared with similar compounds based on other heterocycles.The compounds of the present invention when utilized as accelerators for curing natural rubber, synthetic rubbers such as polybutadiene, EPDM or styrene-butadiene rubber, blends of rubbers such as natural rubber and polybutadiene, styrene-butadiene rubber and polybutadiene, or combinations thereof, result in improved cure rates as indicated by t90-t2 values, t25-t2 values and maximum rate of vulcanization (Vmax) , better scorch delay, higher extent of cure (cure efficiency) , and reduced reversion in comparison with traditional or conventional sulfenamide accelerators. Increased cure rates are very desirable since faster
