<ABSTRACT>
A roof beam construction for use in constructing 
conservatory roofs comprises a glazing bar (10) and 

upper (12) and lower (14) cappings therefor having 
gaskets (30 and 40 respectively) formed integrally on 

edges thereof between which a roofing panel is to be 

retained and means for locating the cappings on the 
glazing bar.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns roof beams especially for
use in constructing conservatories and like structures
having roofs comprising panels usually of translucent
material supported between roof beams.Translucent panels for conservatory roofs are
generally sandwiched at their edges between upper and
lower roof beam forming extrusions coupled to a glazing
bar, usually of aluminium. To provide a good seal above
and below the translucent panels provisions are made for
the roof beam to retain gaskets in suitable positions.Upper beam forming extensions or cappings may
have gaskets formed integrally with panel contacting
edges thereof and gaskets for the underside of the
panels are usually retained in special formations of the
aluminium glazing bars. These gaskets have to be fitted
to the extrusions on site which takes up time. Also,
the extrusions are more expensive to produce because of
the additional gasket retaining formations required.Furthermore, in order to retain the lower beam
forming extrusions, the aluminium glazing bar requires
further formations on which the lower beam extrusion
can locate. FR-A-2418325 which represents the closest prior art discloses a roof beam
construction for use in constructing conservatory
roofs comprising a glazing or reinforcing bar and upper and lower
cappings therefor having gaskets co-extruded thereon
between which gaskets a roof panel is to be
retained and means for locating the cappings on the
glazing bar.EP-A-0001948 discloses a roof beam
construction comprising a glazing bar and upper and
lower cappings therefor, lower cappings having
returned edges that locate the cappings on the
glazing bar. An object of this invention is to simplify
roof beams construction for use in, for example,
constructing conservatories.According to the present invention there is
provided a roof beam construction for use in
constructing conservatory roofs comprising a glazing
bar and upper and lower cappings therefor extruded
from plastics material and having gaskets co-extruded
thereon between which gaskets a roofing panel is to
be retained and means for locating said cappings on
said glazing bar, characterized in that the gaskets are formed on edges of the upper and lower cappings by co-extrusion of rubber or synthetic elastomeric material thereon, and in that the means for
locating the lower capping on the glazing bar
comprises the co-extruded gaskets, which in use are
trapped between the glazing bar and a roofing panel.The preferred lower capping is preferably
extruded of PVC and is

A roof beam construction for use in
constructing conservatory roofs comprising a glazing or reinforcing

bar (10,10',10'',50) and upper and lower cappings (12,14,12',14',12'',14'',64,66)
therefor extruded from plastics material and having

gaskets (30,40,74,86) co-extruded thereon between
which gaskets a roofing panel is to be retained and means

for locating the cappings (12,14,12',14',12'',14'',64,66) on
said glazing or reinforcing bar (10,10',10'',50), characterized in that the gaskets (30,40,74,86) are formed on edges of the upper and lower cappings (12,14,12',14',12'',14'',64,66) by co-extrusion of rubber or synthetic elastomeric material thereon, and in that the means for

locating the lower capping (14,14',14'',66) on the glazing or reinforcing bar (10,10',10'',50)
comprises the co-extruded gaskets (40,86), which in use

are trapped between the glazing or reinforcing bar (10,10',10'',50) and roofing
panel.
A roof beam construction as claimed in claim
1, characterized in that the lower capping (14) is

formed as a channel section with a flat base (36) or
with a base having a pair of angled longitudinal

facets (36A,36B,36A',36B').
A roof beam construction as claimed in claim 2,
characterized in that the gaskets (40) of the lower

capping (14) extend inwards from opposite sides (38)
of the channel.
A roof beam construction as claimed in claim 3,
characterized in that the gaskets (40) of the lower

capping (14) have deformable resilient ribs (42).
A roof beam construction as claimed in claim 3
or 4, characterized in that the lower capping (14) 

has internally of its channel section one or more
spacer projections or ribs (41).
A roof beam construction as claimed in any one
of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the upper

capping (12) has at least one depending side (28) with said edge on
which said gasket (30) is formed.
A roof beam construction as claimed in any one
of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the upper

capping (12) has internally thereof means (32, 34)
for coupling the upper capping (12) to the glazing bar (10).
A roof beam construction as claimed in claim 7,
characterized in that said means comprises resilient formations in the form of divergent flaps (32)

depend from inside of the upper capping (12), which
formations have outward projection lips (34) thereon for

location in an upwardly open channel (20) of the
glazing bar (10), which channel has a serie
s of
internal recesses or notches (24) for receiving the

projections of the capping.
A roof beam construction as claimed in any one
of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the glazing

bar (10,10') has a generally T-shaped cross-section,
inverted in use.
A roof beam construction as claimed in claim 9,
characterized in that the upper limbs (16, 16') of

the T-section are flat or angled relative to each
other.
