<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a squirrel-cage rotor for an electrical motor, with a cage of electrically well conducting rods which pass longitudinally through the bundle of laminae, the ends of the rods projecting from the lamina bundle being connected by rings. The aim of the invention is to eliminate vibration problems which may occur during operation with frequency converters. The invention enables higher natural torsional frequencies to be permitted in the rotor or the design to be made less sensitive by means of simple modifications to the cage, thus eliminating resonance effects. This is achieved by virtue of the fact that the ends of two, three or more adjacent cage rods are brought together in groups and jointed to each other by the rings. Preferred embodiments of the invention, for designs with groups of two, three and four rods, are described in the sub-claims.

Squirrel cage rotor (1) of an electrical machine with a cage, 
which passes axially through the lamination packet and is of 

electrically highly conductive squirrel cage rods (2), which at their 
ends projecting beyond the lamination packet are led together to rod 

connections and connected there (3) in substance bond with a short-circuit 
ring (4), characterised thereby, that the ends of at least 

two squirrel cage rods (2), which lie one beside the other, are each 
time led together in such a manner that the ends each time form a 

latticeworklike junction (3) with the short-circuit ring (4). 
Squirrel cage rotor according to claim 1, chracterised thereby, 
that at least two of two of the squirrel cage rods (2) are angularly 

bent over one tangentially to the other for the formation of the rod 
connections at the ends. 
Squirrel cage rotor according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
thereby, that for the formation of 3-rod connections, two outer 

squirrel cage rods (2a, 2c), each bent over towards the other at the 
ends, are each time led towards a straight squirrel cage middle rod 

(2b) (Figure 1). 
Squirrel cage rotor according to claim 3, characterised thereby, 
that in the case of the formation of the 3-rod connections, the same 

three squirrel cage rods (2) are each time led together closed in 
themselves at both their ends (Figure 2). 
Squirrel cage rotor according to claim 3, characterised thereby, 
that in the case of the formation of the 3-rod connections, one 

squirrel cage rod (26), which is straight at one end, is each time 
bent over at the other and there forms the outer angularly bent-over 

squirrel cage rod (2a) of a progressively further rod connection and 
so forth (Figure 3).  

 
Squirrel cage rotor according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
thereby, that for the formation of 2-rod connections with even number 

of grooves of the rotor, two mutually adjoining squirrel cage rods 
(2) are each time led together at both their ends (Figure 5). 
Squirrel cage rotor according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
thereby, that for the formation of 2-rod connections, each squirrel 

cage rod (2) is angularly bent over tangentially in different 
directions at both its ends and that the different adjoining squirrel 

cage rods are led together at their ends into rod connections 
continuing in meander fashion (Figure 4). 
Squirrel cage rotor according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
thereby, that for the formation of a symmetrical 4-rod connection 

with a number, which is divisible by 4, of grooves of the squirrel 
cage rotor, 4 squirrel cage rods (2) are each time led together at 

both their ends. 
Squirrel cage rotor according to claim 8, characterised thereby, 
that the same four squirrel cage ends each time form a common rod 

connection at both ends (Figure 7). 
Squirrel cage rotor according to claim 8, characterised thereby, 
that two mutually adjoining squirrel cage rods (for example 2g, 2h), 

which are combined at one end with two squirrel cage rods (for 
example 2d, 2e) adjoining in front thereof, each time form a rod 

connection at the other end with two squirrel cage rods (for example 
2h, 2i), which adjoin therebehind (Figure 6).
