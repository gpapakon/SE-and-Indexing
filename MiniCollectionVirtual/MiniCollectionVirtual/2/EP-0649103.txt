<ABSTRACT>
In a method for blending an edge E of a geometric object 15 in a 
computer-aided design (CAD) system, a user can select an edge E 

which is to be blended as well as the size of the blend portion 19. The 
size of the blend portion 19 can be selected, for example, by entering 

a desired blend radius into the CAD system. The CAD system 
calculates the blended object 16 comprising the blend portion 19 and 

the remaining parts of the original object 15. The the intersections (for 
example LB and RB) of the blend surface with the object 15 are 

calculated and it is determined which edges and faces of the original 
object 15 are deleted by the blending operation. The method is capable 

of performing blending operations wherein an arbitrary number of 
edges and faces, for example face 18, are removed from the object. 

The method can also be used for blending an edge E with a variable 
radius and for chamfering the edge.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for blending edges of a geometric
object in a computer-aided design (CAD) system. In the design of
physical objects, for example machine parts, it is often necessary to
blend edges of the object. Blending as hereinafter referred to is a
rounding off of the edges or a chamfering of the edges. The present
invention deals with the performance of the blending operation in a 3D
CAD system which is capable of storing a graphical representation of
the physical object and displaying it three-dimensionally (3D) in an
isometric view and which allows a user to modify this representation
interactively.CAD systems are widely used in the design of mechanical or electronic
parts or other objects and there are several commercially available
systems of that type. A common characteristic of these systems is
that the objects are designed by the user in an interactive mode, that
means that the body is displayed on a screen as far as it has been
designed by the user and the user can enter commands by means of
which additions and modifications of the already existing structure can
be made. For displaying the geometric object under design, typically a
cathode ray tube (CRT) or a liquid crystal display (LCD) is used. The
object is displayed in an isometric view, whereby the displayed object 
may additionally be illuminated by imaginary (i.e., computer generated)
light sources so that the three-dimensional impression is further
improved. As an alternative to the perspective representation on the
screen, a two-dimensional or cross-sectional view of the object under
design can be displayed. Some known CAD systems also allow to
rotate the displayed object around different axes so that the user can
look at the object from several directions. The commands for
supplementing or modifying are entered by suitable input means,
preferably a computer mouse, a graphics tablet or a light pen. When
the editing process is finished and the object to be designed has
assumed its final shape, a corresponding hardcopy can be produced by
a printer or plotter. Furthermore, a punched tape or a magnetic tape
can be produced from the data representing the object, and this can
then can be used directly by a numerically controlled machine tool for
manufacturing the desired physical object.An example for a commercially available 3D CAD system is the
Hewlett-Packard Precision Engineering SolidDesigner Version 1.0. A
description of a 3D CAD system is also known from I.C. Braid : "Notes
on a geometric modeller", C.A.D. Group

<CLAIMS>
A method for blending edges of a geometric object in a computer-aided
design system, comprising the steps of :


a) selecting, by a user, an edge (E) to blend, said edge (E) having a
start vertex (SV), and an end vertex (EV),
b) selecting, by a user, shape and size of a blend surface, said steps being followed by the following system steps:
c) calculating blend boundaries (LB, RB) by determining the intersection
of the desired blend surface with the geometric object,
d) calculating all intersections of the blend boundaries (LB, RB) with
edges of the geometric object (91) connected to the start vertex (SV)

or to the end vertex (EV),
e) deleting edges (W3) for which step d) does not provide an intersection
and repeating step d) with a new edge (W3new) which has been

created by the deletion and which is connected to the start vertex
(SV) or to the end vertex (EV),
f) calculating the blend surface ,
g) calculating all intersections of the blend surface with the edges
(W10) which are connected to the start vertex (SV) or to the end

vertex (EV) and which have not yet been intersected in a previous
step, with edges (W5) and corresponding faces (F) which have no

intersection with the blend surface being deleted,
h) inserting between the intersections (S1, S3, S11, S12, S4, S2)
calculated in the previous steps, the corresponding portion (90) of

the blend surface, and
i) displaying the resulting geometric object (92).
A method as in claim 1, wherein the deletion of edges is performed by
the Euler operation "kev" and the deletion of faces is performed by the

Euler operation "kbfv".
A method as in claims 1 or 2, wherein the blend surface has variable
radius.
A method as in claims 1 or 2, wherein the blend surface is a chamfer.
