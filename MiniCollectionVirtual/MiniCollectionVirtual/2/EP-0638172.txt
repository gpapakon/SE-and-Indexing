<ABSTRACT>
Processing of  beta -amyloid precursor protein ( beta APP) is monitored by detecting the secretion of a soluble bAPP fragment resulting from cleavage of  beta APP at the amino-terminus of  beta -amyloid peptide. in vivo monitoring of secretion of the  beta APP fragment may be monitored for diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease and other  beta -amyloid-related diseases, while in vitro monitoring of such secretion from cultured cells may be monitored to identify inhibitors of  beta -amyloid production. The  beta APP fragment may be detected using antibodies and other specific binding substances which recognize a carboxy-terminal residue on the fragment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to methods
and compositions for monitoring the processing of β-amyloid
precursor protein. More particularly, the present invention
relates to the use of such methods and compositions for the
diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring response to therapy of
Alzheimer's disease, and for screening and evaluation of
potential drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the presence
of numerous amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (highly
insoluble protein aggregates) present in the brains of
Alzheimer's disease patients, particularly in those regions
involved with memory and cognition. While in the past there
was significant scientific debate over whether the plaques and
tangles are a cause or are merely the result of Alzheimer's
disease, recent discoveries indicate that amyloid plaque is a
causative precursor or factor. In particular, it has been
discovered that the production of β-amyloid peptide, a major
constituent of the amyloid plaque, can result from mutations in
the gene encoding amyloid precursor protein, a protein which
when normally processed will not produce the β-amyloid peptide.
The identification of mutations in the amyloid precursor
protein gene which cause familial, early onset Alzheimer's
disease is the strongest evidence that amyloid metabolism is
the central event in the pathogenic process underlying the
disease. Four reported disease-causing mutations include with
respect to the 770 isoform, valine717 to isoleucine (Goate et
al. (1991) Nature 349:704-706), valine717 to glycine (Chartier 
Harlan et al. (1991) Nature 353:844-846, valine717 to
phenylalanine (Murrell et al. (1991) Science 254:97-99) and
with respect to the 695 isoform, a double mutation changing
lysine595-methionine596 to asparagine595-leucine596 (Mullan et
al. (1992) Nature Genet 1:345-347). Moreover, β-amyloid
peptide is toxic to brain neurons, and neuronal cell death is
associated with the disease.Thus, the ability to monitor cellular processing of
the amyloid precursor protein would be of significant value in
the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic supervision of
Alzheimer's disease. In particular, it would be desirable to
identify minimally invasive procedures for screening and
evaluating detectable diagnostic markers in readily obtainable
patient samples, such as serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and
the like.A number of potential diagnostic markers for
Alzheimer's disease have been proposed. Of particular interest
to the present
