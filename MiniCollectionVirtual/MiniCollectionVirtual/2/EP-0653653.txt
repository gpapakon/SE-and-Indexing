<ABSTRACT>
A fiber optic termination for incorporating within 
a fiber optic connector is capable of mechanical 

assembly which can preclude the use of adhesives for 
termination assembly. A metal plunger (32) compresses a 

bullet (24) having an aperture (25) therethrough into a 
constriction causing the bullet to grip a fiber. 
A metal insert (27) lines the interior of an 
alignment ferrule (1) and engages the actuating plunger 

(32) with an interference fit. The interference fit 
retains the plunger over time and over a broad operating 

temperature range. Grooves (28) of the metal insert 
create pockets of engagement between the insert (27) and 

the alignment ferrule (1) that resist axial displacement 
of the insert relative to the alignment ferrule.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to terminations for
fiber optic cable, and particularly, to an optical
connector having instant handling strength that can
preclude or augment the use of adhesives during
termination assembly.Optical data transmission over light transmitting
fiber, continues to be an attractive alternative to
other forms of information transfer. Optical fiber has
a higher bandwidth and lower signal degradation over the
same conductor length than the electrical counterpart.
Compactness and immunity to electromagnetic interference
renders optical fiber amenable to many types of
operating environments.Many optical connectors use adhesives to bond the
fiber to the termination. Fiber optic cable consists of
layers of different materials concentric about a fiber.
A typical cable consists of a central glass fiber, a
coating, a buffer, strands of strength members, and a
jacket. As is commonly the case, the fiber is adherent
to the coating, but the coating is not adherent to the
buffer. Adhesives provide distributed retention of a
fiber to the termination by providing a continuous
restraint along the length of the termination adhered to
the fiber and the buffered fiber. This distributed
retention prevents slippage between the fiber and the
buffer. Adhesives also provide stability of fiber
retention over temperature and time.Adhesives typically require either heating, a
curing time, or both in order to create the desired
bond. Many optical termination installations occur in
the field and after an optical cable network is in
place. Assembly of a termination using a thermoset
adhesive requires heating equipment and power.
Installation of each termination requires a warm up time
for the heating unit and a curing time to set the 
adhesive bond. Assembly of terminations in many
locations, therefore, requires an installer for each
termination to (1) move the heating equipment and power,
if necessary, to each termination location, (2) wait the
warm-up time, (3) assemble the connector, (4) wait the
curing time, (5) disassemble the equipment and (6) move
to the next location. Systems having instant handling
strength can be used either without an adhesive, the
mechanical system providing all fiber retention, or in
conjunction with an adhesive, the mechanical system
providing sufficient retention of the fiber to permit an
adhesive to cure over time without operator involvement.
Systems having instant handling strength, therefore, can
save a great deal of time and effort by obviating the
need for heating

An optical connector comprising:

a forward ferrule (16) having a forward passage (17,
19, 20) therethrough,
a body (22) having a rearward passage (21)
therethrough, said rearward passage being coaxial with

said forward passage, wherein said body (22) is connected
to said forward ferrule (16) to form an alignment ferrule

(1),
a hollow plunger (32) with a through passage (36, 37,
38) and collapsible tines (41) in a rearward portion (34)

thereof disposed within said body (22),
a constriction (19) within said forward passage (17,
19, 20), and
a deformable bullet-like member (24) having an
aperture (25) therethrou
gh, said member (24) being
disposed within said forward passage forward of said

plunger (32) wherein said member (24) is capable of being
deformed by said plunger (32) urging said member (24) into

said constriction (19), said aperture (25) being capable
of responding to the deformation of said member (24) by

enclosing upon and gripping a fibre (8), said member (24)
being held in said constriction (19) as a consequence of

an interference fit,

characterised in that
said connector also comprises a metal insert (27)
with a through aperture lining the rearward passage (21)

of said body (22) and a hollow axial displacement member
(42) with a through passage disposed within said insert

(27) which displacement member (42) is separate from and
positioned rearwardly of said plunger (32),

wherein said interference fit is provided by
frictional engagement of said displacement member (42) and

said insert (27).

said insert (27) has at least one annular groove (28)

engaging said alignment ferrule (1) thereby resisting
axial displacement of said insert (27) relative to said

alignment ferrule (1).

wherein said interference fit results from detents (31)

protruding radially inward of said insert (27) engaging
said displacement member (42).
An optical connector according to any preceding claim
wherein said plunger (32) has a coefficient of thermal

expansion similar to that of said insert (27).
An optical connector according to any preceding claim
wherein said rearward plunger portion (34) has an outer

diameter larger than an inner diameter of said insert
(27), and further comprises at least two longitudinal

slits (40) creating said tines (41) in said rearward
plunger portion (34) and permitting said rearward plunger

portion (34) to collapse inwardly upon engagement of said
rearward plunger portion (34) with said insert (27).
