<ABSTRACT>
A control system for a reproduction device (10) which reproduces an image on one or 
more sheets controls reproduction of a print job according to the quantity of copy sheets (64) in 

a supply source (18) as compared to the quantity of original sheets (42) in the print job and the 
quantity of copies to be made. The user is signalled as to the sufficiency of sheets in the supply 

source for completing the job so as to avoid interruption of the print job. Only when there is a 
sufficient quantity of sheets in the supply source will the reproduction automatically 

commence.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reproduction system for reproducing an image from an 
original document, and to a method for determining the sufficiency of copy sheets in the paper 
supply source of such a system to complete a print job before the print job commences. Many reproduction systems which reproduce an image on a plurality of sheets are 
equipped with a document handler and a controller to instruct the document handler when to 
feed an original from a set of originals for imaging on a platen in an effort to expedite 
reproduction of large print jobs. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,130,750 which discloses a 
copier with a document handler and a controller that counts and compares the number of 
originals with respect to the number of copies made. During processing, this information is 
utilized to keep track of the respective originals and the copy sheets. The problem in the '750 
patent is that the document handler automatically begins to copy without regard to the 
sufficiency of sheets in the paper supply source to complete the print job. Therefore, the print 
job being processed in accordance with the '750 patent automatically halts when the paper 
supply is empty causing delay and inefficiency for a user. The success and the efficiency of the document handler in current printing systems is 
severely limited because the user is unable to determine before beginning the print job 
whether the amount of paper in the copy paper supply source is sufficient to complete the 
print job. Presently, the only way for a user to determine how many sheets of copy paper are in 
the supply source would be for the user to manually count the sheets contained in the supply 
source. If the user begins a job when there is insufficient paper in the supply source to complete 
a job, the reproduction device will stop at whatever point in the job that the paper supply 
is depleted. In this case, the user must reload paper into the supply source and restart the job. 
This interruption results in delay and inefficiency due to down time while the machine sits idle 
until the user replenishes the supply source. A job interruption is an inconvenience for the user, 
causes delay in production and is inefficient. The user may also have to determine where the 
job was interrupted and ensure that all of the originals were copied. While the related art recognizes controlling a print job during processing, a system is 
needed that controls printing before the print job commences to enable the above-described 
interruptions

<CLAIMS>
A reproduction system for reproducing an image from an original document, 
comprising: 

   input means (28) for inputting print data, including a quantity of copies to be made; 
   reproduction means for reproducing the image on at least one copy sheet based on 

the input print data; 
   supply means (18) for supplying at least one copy sheet to said reproduction means; 

   supply determination means (30) coupled to said supply means for determining a 
quantity of copy sheets in said supply means; and 

   control means (12) for controlling reproduction based on the input print data and 
the quantity of copy sheets determined by said supply determination means, said control 

means being coupled to said input means, said supply determination means and said 
reproduction means. 
A reproduction system according to claim 1, wherein the input print data includes a 
quantity of original sheets in the original document. 
A reproduction system according to claim 1 or claim 2, further comprising a holding 
means (14) for loading the original document, and a counting means (94) for counting a 

quantity of sheets in the original document loaded in said holding means, said counting means 
being coupled to said holding means and in communication with said control means. 
A reproduction system according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein said supply 
determination means is a linear velocity displacement transducer (36) which measures a height 

of the at least one copy sheet in said supply means. 
A reproduction system according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein said supply 
determination means is a load cell (34) which measures a weight of the at least one copy sheet 

in said supply means. 
A reproduction system according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein said 
control means includes a comparison means for comparing the input print data and the 

quantity of copy sheets in said supply means to determine whether the quantity of copy sheets 
in said supply means is sufficient to complete a print job based on the input print data. 
A reproduction system according to claim 6, further comprising a display means (38) 
for displaying a result of the comparison from said comparison means. 
A method for determining a sufficiency of copy sheets in a supply source of a 
reproduction system for reproducing an original image from a document on at least one copy 

sheet, comprising the steps of: 
   inputting input data comprising a quantity of copies to be reproduced and a quantity 

of original sheets in the document; 
   determining a quantity of copy sheets in said supply source; 

   comparing said input data to said quantity of copy sheets in the supply source to 
determine the sufficiency of copy sheets in the supply source to complete a print job based on 

the input data; and 
   displaying a message which indicates the sufficiency of copy sheets in the supply 

source to complete a print job based on the input data and the quantity of copy sheets in the 
supply source. 
A method according to claim 8, further comprising the step of automatically 
commencing reproduction of the image when there is a sufficient supply of copy sheets. 
A method according to claim 8 or claim 9, further comprising the step of weighing 
the quantity of copy sheets in the supply source with a load cell to determine the quantity of 

copy sheets in the supply source. 
A method according to claim 8 or claim 9, further comprising the step of measuring a 
height of the quantity of copy sheets in the supply source with a linear velocity displacement 

transducer to determine the quantity of sheets in the supply source.
