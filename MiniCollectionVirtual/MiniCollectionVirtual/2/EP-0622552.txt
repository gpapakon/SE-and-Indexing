<ABSTRACT>
Device for joining a hollow body to a support using a screw (38), particularly for the connection between a first (10) and a second (12) section (profile), more particularly for assembling a bed frame sold as a self-assembly pack, the first section (10) being pierced with a first (18) and a second (36) hole respectively through the upper (14) and lower (16) walls of this first section, and the second (12) section comprising an insert (30) integral with the second section, characterised in that it comprises a sleeve tube (bush) (22) with a body (24) designed to penetrate through the first hole (18) of the first section, this body (24) comprising a longitudinal internal hole (28) coaxial with this body, designed to guide the screw, the second hole (36) of the first section having a smaller diameter than that of the head of the screw. The invention also relates to an alternative which comprises a tube end.
