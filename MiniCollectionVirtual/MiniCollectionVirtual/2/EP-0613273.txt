<ABSTRACT>
A packet switching system includes a plurality 
of incoming channels, through which packets arrive. The 

system has a circuit providing arrival time information 
for header information of respective packets. The 

arrival time information is then copied by a copying 
circuit. The copied information is accumulated in an 

arrival time information accumulating circuit in an order 
of the arrival time. On the other hand, the packet is 

accumulated by a packet accumulating circuit in an 
order of the arrival time. A control circuit is adapted 

to output the packets accumulated in the packet 
accumulating circuit and having the arrival time 

information consistent with the arrival time information 
accumulated at the leading end of the arrival time 

information accumulating circuit. The packets are 
output from the packet accumulating circuit according to 

destinations contained in the header information thereof 
through a plurality of outgoing channels for feeding out 

the routed packets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
packet switching system. More specifically, the
invention relates to a packet switching technology in a
digital communication network employing a packet.Much attention has been given to a high
speed packet switching system for transmitting and
exchanging information at ultra-high speed by
transforming all information, such as voice, data, image
and so forth in packets and employing simplified
protocol. In such high speed packet switching system,a
large scale packet switching system for more than several
hundreds of channels is realized by connecting middle or
small scale packet switches in a plurality of stages.In such case, there is a system, in which the
first stage packet switch does not perform a path
selection for the input packet and the input packet is
uniformly supplied to subsequent stages of packet switch
regardless of its address information and path selection
is performed in the subsequent stages of packet switch
for simplification of a path selection control
and for preventing an internal blocking
(which means a condition wherein call cannot be connected 
due to blocking of an internal link despite of presence
of vacant capacity in the incoming and outgoing
channels).In this system, since each of packets of the
same call follows a different path, different packets
suffer a different delay time, and the order of the
packets in the same call becomes an irregular sequence.
A solution for this problem
has been disclosed in a paper entitled "A Study on Control
Algorithm for Large Scale ATM Switch" in The Institute of
Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers
Technical Study Report, Switching System Engineering -
SSE 89-173, 1989.The conventional system will be discussed
hereinafter with reference to Fig. 9. Fig. 9 shows the
block diagram of the conventional system. In the above-identified
literature, the switching system is
constituted of three stages of switches, as shown in Fig.
9. Eight each of input ports 711 ∼ 788 are provided for
each of the first stage switches and eight each of output
ports 911 ∼ 988 are provided for each of the third stage
switches.Time stamping circuit 411 ∼ 488 are provided for
each of input ports and packet buffer circuit 511 ∼ 588 are
also provided for each of output ports. The time
stamping circuit provides a time stamp representing input
time information for each of packets input at an input 
port. Each of input packets is distributed to respective
second stage switches 21 ∼ 28 by the first stage switch
regard
