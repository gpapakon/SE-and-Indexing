<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a granular, silicate-built, 
phosphate free laundry detergent composition comprising 

fine alkali metal percarbonate particles having mean 
particle diameter below 450 µm, preferably below 400 µm, 

wherein no more than 20%, preferably no more than 10%, of 
the particles have a diameter above 710 µm, said particles 

having a coating comprising one or more soluble inorganic 
salts. The salts may be selected from alkali or alkaline 

earth metal carbonates, sulphates, chlorides and nitrates. 
The coated percarbonate particles have improved stability 

to storage and are capable of dissolving quickly in wash 
liquor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to granular laundry detergent
compositions having a content of silicate-based builder and
alkali metal percarbonate as an oxygen-releasing compound.Detergent compositions containing alkali metal
percarbonate are known in the art. Percarbonate is an
attractive perhydrate bleaching agent for use in detergent
compositions because it dissolves readily in water, is
weight efficient and, after giving up its available oxygen,
provides a useful source of carbonate ions for detergency
purposes and does not provide undesirable by-products.The inclusion of percarbonate salts in laundry
detergent compositions has been restricted hitherto by
their relative instability in storage. In particular,
percarbonate salts decompose rapidly when stored in a moist
and/or warm atmosphere.It has been attempted to obtain acceptable storage
characteristics by coating crystalline percarbonate. A
variety of coating agents have been proposed including
silicate and mixtures of inorganic sulphate and carbonate
salts. An example of such a coating is disclosed in GB-A-1,466,799,
which discloses percarbonate particles coated
with a mixed salt comprising sodium carbonate and one or
more other sodium salts. The storage stability was tested
of these percarbonate particles in a detergent composition
comprising phosphate builders.Considerable interest exists in the development of
more "environmentally friendly" detergent compositions and
processes, for instance for washing laundry in the home.
"Environmentally friendly" detergent compositions are often
characterised in that they minimise the levels of
components which may cause environmentally undesirable
effects. Thus phosphate builders are considered
undesirable.Builders are based on silicate, including
aluminosilicate ion exchange materials known as zeolites, 
and contain no phosphate. However the storage stability of
percarbonate is a greater problem in silicate-built
(especially zeolite-built) detergent powders than in
phosphate-built detergent powders, possibly due to the fact
that such compositions tend to have a large mobile water
content.It has been attempted to solve this problem in EP-A-0451,893
and EP-546015-A. This discloses zeolite-built detergent powders
containing sodium percarbonate with a controlled particle
size distribution; fine percarbonate particles are excluded
and coarser particles having high mean particle diameter
are used. Reactivity is inversely proportional to size and
so the coarser particles are of lower reactivity than finer
particles.
