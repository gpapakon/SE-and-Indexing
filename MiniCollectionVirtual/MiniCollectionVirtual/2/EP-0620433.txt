<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electrochemical sensor which consists of at least two electrodes, which are in contact with a liquid measurement-cell electrolyte, and a housing (7) which encloses the electrode and the electrolyte. In order to improve electrochemical sensors of this kind by making the sensor specifications, especially the sensitivity, completely independent of the particular geometrical position of the sensor, it is proposed to coat the surfaces of the electrodes (1, 2) which face the electrolyte and at least one electrolyte bridge web (3) which connects the electrodes (1, 2) to one another, with a semipermeable membrane (4, 5, 6):

<CLAIMS>
An electrochemical sensor comprising at least two electrodes that are
in contact with a fluid measurement cell electrolyte and a housing (7)

enclosing at least the electrolyte, wherein the surface of the electrodes
(1, 2) facing the electrolyte and at least one crossbar (3) bridging the

electrolyte and connecting the electrodes (1, 2) with one another is
coated with a hydrophilic, semipermeable membrane (4, 5, 6).
The electrochemical sensor of claim 1 characterized in that the
crossbar (3) bridging the electrolyte is formed by the hydrophilic,

semipermeable membrane in the form of a hydrophilic membrane film
(8) of polysulfone, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyamide or polyhydantoine

applied to the inner side of the housing (7).
The electrochemical sensor of claim 1 or 2 characterized in that the
hydrophilic, semipermeable membrane layers (4, 5, 6, 8) comprise a

membrane material containing filler, wherein the content of filler is
preferably higher than the polymer content.
The electrochemical sensor of claims 1 to 3 characterized in that the
hydrophilic, semipermeable membrane layer comprises 15 to 25 parts

polysulfone and 85 to 75 parts titanium dioxide and/or 15 to 25 parts
polyhydantoine and 85 to 75 parts titanium dioxide and that the

thickness of the membrane layer is 25 µm to 100 µm, preferably 100
µm to 500 µm.
