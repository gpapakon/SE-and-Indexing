<ABSTRACT>
Sites on antibodies having affinity for photoaffinity compounds, in particular purine or azidopurine containing compounds are taught. Such photoaffinity sites are contained on a conserved region of different antibody molecules. These sites provide for the site-specific attachment of nucleotide photoaffinity compounds to antibodies, e.g., ATP- or GTP-analog photoaffinity compounds by photochemical means. These mucleotide photoaffinity compounds may additionally be attached to molecules having a desired therapeutic or diagnostic activity, and the resultant conjugates used as diagnostics or therapeutics.

<DESCRIPTION>
DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC NUCLEOÎ—DE OR NUCLEOSIDE PHOTOAFFINITY COMPOUND MODIFIED ANTIBODIES, AND USE THEREOFFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to the discovery of a novel site or sites on antibodies having high affinity for nucleotide or nucleoside photoaffinity compounds. The present invention further relates to the use of said novel site or sites as a target for photoaffinity labeling using nucleotide or nucleoside photoaffinity compounds and for the attachment of molecules having a particular chemical or biological activity. In particular, the present invention concerns a site or sites on antibodies having high affinity for purine or purine derivative containing photoaffinity compounds, e.g. , ATP- or GTP-analog photoaffinity compounds and the use of these sites as targets for purine or purine derivative photoaffinity compounds or other heterocyclic base containing compounds which have affinity for these sites and for the attachment of molecules having a particular chemical or biological activity.The present invention further relates to identification of a novel photoaffinity site comprised on antibody materials by computer modeling and other methods in order to identify its specific position on antibody molecules. The identification of this specific site, and specifically the specific amino acid residues, will allow this site to be protected prior to photoaffinity attachment of desired compounds and also enable similar sites to be identified on other proteins. The present invention further relates to compositions, methods, and test kits which contain or use the subject nucleotide photoaffinity labeled antibodies. The present invention still further relates to novel compositions, methods and test kits which use the procedure of photoaffinity labeling with nucleotide affinity 

probes, to attach molecules having a desired chemical or biological activity to antibody molecules.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONAntibodies are specific immunoglobulin molecules produced by vertebrate immune systems in response to challenge by foreign proteins, glycoproteins, cells, or other typically foreign substances. The sequence of events which permits an organism to overcome invasion by foreign cells or to rid the system of foreign substances is at least partially understood. An important part of this process is the manufacture of antibodies which bind specifically to a particular foreign antigenic substance. The binding specificity of such polypeptides to a particular antigen is highly refined, and the
