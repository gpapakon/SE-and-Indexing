Method of joining thin mating plates especially sheet metal 
or plate sections by cold joining in which the mating 

surfaces of the plates or plate sections to be joined are 
deep drawn and squeezed flat in a single working stroke by 

an interaction of the die (8) and the mold (5) with or 
without partial punching of the surfaces, characterized in 

that 

the pressing force exercised on the plates as stamping 
force by the die (8) or as matrix force by the mold (5) is 

measured immediately after squeezing and that 
the skimming force needed by the die (8) to skim off the 
joined plates or plate sections is measured. 
Method according to claim 1., characterized in that the 
measured values (II, VI, VII) for pressing force and 

skimming force are compared to a set maximum value (IV) and 
a set minimum value (III). 
Method according to claim 2., characterized in that a 
signal is effected when the maximum value (IV) is exceeded 

or the minimum value (III) falls short.  
 
Method according to one of the above claims characterized 
in that a signal is effected when either the die (8) or the 

mould (5) do not travel the set working stroke (I) in the 
joining process. 
Method according to claims 3. or 4., characterized in that 
the signal is a control signal controlling an acoustic 

and/or visual display. 
Method according to claims 3., 4., or 5., characterized in 
that the signal is used to interrupt the respective joining 

process. 
Method according to claim 6., characterized in that in the 
case of an interruption the process can only be continued 

after unlocking. 
Method according to one of the claims 2. through 7., 
characterized in that the maximum (IV) and minimum (III) 

values are stored in an electronic memory for recall. 
Method according to claim 8., characterized in that the 
maximum and minimum values can be adjusted by a force 

measuring device (12, 13) either manually or using a 
computer featuring the above mentioned memory.  

 
Method according to claims 8. or 9., characterized in that 
the memory stores different sets of maximum (IV) and 

minimum (III) values. 
Method according to one of the above claims, characterized 
in that a set working stroke (I) is stored in the 

electronic memory for recall. 
Method according to claim 11., characterized in that the 
set working stroke (I) can be adjusted at a position 

indicator (14) either manually or by a computer featuring a 
memory. 
Method according to one of the claims 8. through 12., 
characterized in that the input of the maximum (IV) and 

minimum (III) values and/or the set working stroke is 
protected against misuse or loss. 
Method according to one of the above claims characterized 
in that the forces are measured at several cold joining 

points at the same time, and the values are processed by 
the same data processing device. 
Method according to one of the above claims, characterized 
in that the elicited values (II, VI, VII) are displayed 

visually.  
 
Method according to one of the above claims, characterized 
in that the elicited values (II, VI, VII) are stored 

electronically. 
Device for carrying out the method according to one of the 
above claims using a mould (5) positioned in a mechanical 

press (1) and a die (8) driven to and fro at right angles 
to the plates to be joined, characterized in that a 

position indicator (14) and at least one force measuring 
device (12) for measuring the pressing force and a force 

measuring device for measuring the skimming force are 
present. 
Device according to claim 17., characterized in that a 
transmitter is connected motion-locking to the die (8) to 

effect a linear or rotary motion. 
Device according to claims 17. or 18., characterized in 
that one or several piezo elements serve as force measuring 

devices (12, 13). 
Device according to claim 17. or 18., characterized in that 
one or several strain gauges serve as force measuring 

devices (12, 13). 
Device according to one of the claims 17. through 20., 
characterized in that the force measuring device for  

 
measuring the pressing force is positioned in a mould mount 

(5) or on the press table (3). 
Device according to one of the claims 17. through 21., 
characterized in that the force measuring device (12) is 

positioned between die (8) and pressure cylinder (10). 
Device according to one of the claims 17. through 22., 
characterized in that the position indicator (14) is 

integrated into a stroke limiter (15).
