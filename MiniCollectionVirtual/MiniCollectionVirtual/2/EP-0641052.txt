<ABSTRACT>
In an external-cavity tunable wavelength light 
source using a semiconductor laser (LD) (1), when an 

interferometer serving as an optical filter is constituted 
by part of an external cavity, an external-cavity 

longitudinal mode can be selected with good reproducibility, 
and a side mode suppression ratio can be 

increased. A light beam emitted from an AR-coated facet 
of an LD (1) is converted into a collimated beam by a 

lens (2), and the collimated beam is incident on a 
Mach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometer (5) serving as an optical 

filter. An interference light beam emerges from the 
MZ interferometer (5) toward a diffraction grating (3) 

serving as a preselector. Only a light component having 
a specific wavelength and selected by spectrally dispersing 

the interference light beam reversely travels in 
the same optical path as that of the interference light 

beam and is returned to the LD (1). In this manner, a 
cavity is formed between the LD (1) and the diffraction 

grating (3), and a laser beam having a wavelength determined 
by three relationships between an external-cavity 

longitudinal mode, a cavity loss caused by the diffraction 
grating (3), and the output characteristics of an 

interference light beam from the MZ interferometer (5) 
is oscillated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a
tunable wavelength light source, particularly, to an
external-cavity tunable waveguide light source using a
semiconductor laser, and more particularly, to a tunable
wavelength optical source in which an optical filter
using an interferometer serves as part of an external
cavity to tune the oscillation wavelength of a laser
beam at good reproducibility and a high resolving power,
thereby improving various characteristics such as a side
mode suppression ratio and a spectral line width.As a typical conventional external-cavity tunable
wavelength light source using a semiconductor laser and
used in the above field, a tunable waveguide light
source in which a wavelength is selected by an external
diffraction grating is known.FIG. 9 shows the arrangement of a conventional
external-cavity tunable waveguide light source.A light beam emerging from an AR-coated (AR:
Anti-Reflection) facet 1a of a semiconductor laser (LD)
1 is converted into a collimated beam by a lens 2, and
the parallel beam is incident on a diffraction grating
3. The collimated beam is spectrally dispersed by the
diffraction grating 3, and only a light component having
a specific wavelength (to be described later) is
returned to the LD 1. In this manner, a cavity is 
formed between a facet 1b of the LD 1 which is not
AR-coated and the diffraction grating 3, thereby
oscillating a laser beam having a wavelength determined
by a cavity length L. An output laser beam is emitted
from the facet 1b of the LD 1 which is not AR-coated.Note that an oscillation wavelength setting unit 4
outputs a rotary drive signal to rotate the diffraction
grating 3 in a direction of a two-headed arrow R using a
rotary shaft 3a as a fulcrum, thereby setting an incident
angle  of the light beam which is incident from
the lens 2 on the diffraction grating 3.The principle of the above laser oscillation will
be described below.Light beams incident on the diffraction grating 3
are diffracted at different angles depending on the
wavelengths of the light beams. More specifically,
as shown in FIG. 10, when the grating constant of
the diffraction grating 3 is represented by d, and an
incident angle with respect to the diffraction grating
3 is represented by , a wavelength λ at which an
exit angle β is obtained satisfies the following
equation:
mλ = d(sin + sinβ),
      (where m is a diffracted order which can be set to
±1, ±2, ....)In the light beam incident on the diffraction
grating 3, a light component having a wavelength which
