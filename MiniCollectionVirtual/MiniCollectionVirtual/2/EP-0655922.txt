<ABSTRACT>
The oligomers of the present invention are polyureas or polyamides having a number average molecular weight of 
<
 10,000. These oligomers are water-soluble, have a rigid backbone with a predictable anion spacing, and are pharmaceutically-acceptable. The oligomers are useful for inhibiting the proliferation of smooth muscle cell.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to certain anionic oligomers 
which are useful antiproliferative agents by virtue of 
their ability to inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation. 
These compounds can be used in the treatment of, for 
example, atherosclerosis. Proliferation of smooth muscle cells in blood vessel 
walls occurs in reponse to vascular injury and in 
association with certain disease states. The proliferation 
of these cells can lead to the formation of pathologic 
lesions, for example, atherosclerosis and postsurgical 
vascular restenosis. Various glycosaminoglycans including 
heparin have been reported to inhibit smooth muscle cell 
proliferation. However, long term therapy with heparin is 
limited by its untoward side effects. Applicants have discovered that a class of synthetic 
oligomers are heparinmimetic in that this class of 
oligomers inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation in 
culture and in vivo. The synthetic oligomers do not possess 
the liabilities of prolonged heparin therapy. Such 
oligomers would thus be useful in the treatment of a 
variety of diseases and conditions associated with the 
smooth muscle cell and with other cells exhibiting 
unregulated cell proliferation.  
 This invention relates to the use of anionic polyamide 
and polyurea oligomers of formulae 1a and 1b, respectively,
