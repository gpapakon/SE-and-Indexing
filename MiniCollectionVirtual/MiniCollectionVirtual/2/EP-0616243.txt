<ABSTRACT>
A method is specified for manufacturing a cascaded optical switch and a switch of this type manufactured according to this method. The switch, consisting of many optical branches, is generated on one single substrate. In this connection, for the growing of active, that is to say controllable light-amplifying or light-absorbing waveguide regions, a method is used which can generate locally limitable, different layer thicknesses and/or material compositions of the grown active layers in the same operation. In this case, the number and position of active (1, 3) and passive (2, 4) waveguide regions can be determined by the formation of regions (M) masked, for example, with SiO2 before the actual coating.

A method of manufacturing an optical space switch
composed of optical waveguides, with a Y-shaped branch area

wherein the optical waveguides are designed as passive
waveguides, and which contains at least two further

unbranched areas that are connected to the branched area,
and wherein the optical waveguides are designed as active

waveguides, characterized in that active and passive
waveguide areas (1, 3; 2, 4) are grown in a single coating

process which utilizes locally limitable effects that
influence the growth rate of the layer.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that,
in order to influence the growth rate of the layer at least

in the active waveguide areas (1, 3), these are arranged
between areas (M) on the substrate surface which are masked

with a dielectric layer, and the width of the waveguide (WL,
WL1, WL2) varies in the waveguide areas, and/or the size of

the masked areas (M) bordering on the waveguide areas
varies.
A method as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that
no masking by means of a dielectric layer is provided along

passive waveguide areas (2, 4).
A method as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that
the masked areas (M) bordering on the waveguide areas are

wider along the active areas (1, 3) and narrower along the
passive areas (2, 4), when viewed parallel to the direction

of light propagation. 
An optical space switch composed of optical
waveguides, with a Y-shaped branch area wherein the optical

waveguides are designed as passive waveguides, and which
contains at least two further unbranched areas that are

connected to the branched area, and in which the optical
waveguides are designed as active waveguides, characterized

in that in the direction of light propagation the active and
passive waveguide areas are narrow lengthy parts of a

continuous and contiguous semiconductor layer, or of a
continuous and contiguous semiconductor layer packet.
