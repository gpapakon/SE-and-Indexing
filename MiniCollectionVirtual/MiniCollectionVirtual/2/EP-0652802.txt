<ABSTRACT>
A device for admixing a processing agent to a pulp suspension in a bin, which device is intended to be attached to the bin wall and comprises a conical housing (1) with a rotary shaft (6), on which a propeller (12) with a hub (7) is attached. The propeller is enclosed by a nozzle (11) for accelerating the pulp in the bin. The housing (1) comprises also a dilution chamber (5) for the processing agent and has an aperture (15) to the hub (7). A gap (8) for supply of processing agent to the pulp suspension is defined between the housing (1) and the nozzle (11) in the inlet end of the nozzle (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for admixing a 
processing agent to a pulp suspension in a bin. The agent can 
consist of liquids and chemicals, substantially in fluid state, 
for dilution or other treatment. At all kinds of pulp processing, a persistently 
continuous and proportional admixture of processing agent to the 
pulp is of decisive importance for obtaining an acceptable 
result. In known devices the processing agent is admixed in the 
lower portion of a pulp bin. The mixing device comprises a 
propeller, which accelerates the pulp to a high rate through a 
nozzle whereby surrounding pulp is sucked in continuously. The 
processing agent is added to the pulp before it is sucked into 
the mixing device. High pulp concentration in the bin, for 
example 12%, however, implies a problem for achieving continuous 
admixing. In order to reduce this problem, the bin has been 
designed so as to have a bottom zone of reduced size. This, 
however, results in a decrease in processing volume and in a more 
complicated and more expensive bin design. Such an arrangement 
also requires more energy, due to an incomplete admixing 
technique. FI-B-85164 discloses a device for admixing a fluid to a 
pulp suspension. This device includes a conical housing with a 
rotary shaft and a propeller. The fluid is supplied through an 
annular opening behind the propeller. However, this opening 
cannot be adjusted and the propeller is not combined with any 
means for guiding and accelerating the pulp. This results in 
incomplete admixing and high energy consumption. According to the present invention, the above problem is 
eliminated in that the processing agent is adjustably added and 
distributed centrally, and the pulp flow is improved. The mixing 
result is improved, and at the same time the energy consumption 
is minimized. The characterizing features of the invention are 
apparent from the attached claims. The invention is described in greater detail in the 
following, with reference to the accompanying drawing showing an 
embodiment of the invention.  
 
Fig. 1 is a cross-section of a mixing device according to 
the invention; Fig. 2 is a section according to II-II in Fig. 1; Fig. 3 is an alternative embodiment of the invention. The mixing device in Fig. 1 comprises a conical housing 
1 with a flange 2 to be attached in the lower portion of a bin 
for the pulp suspension to which the processing agent is to be 
admixed. The housing 1 comprises a supply chamber 3 with a 
connection 13, through which the processing
