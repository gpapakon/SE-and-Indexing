<ABSTRACT>
To provide a method of integrally laminating gas permeable materials by means of an inexpensive equipment 
while completely retaining a gas permeability of the materials, which method solves problems of degradation of a 

gas permeability and manufacture of unstable laminates and is not influenced by external factors such as changes of 
weights of the gas permeable materials, and variation in thickness, and is simple and applicable to mass production. A 

method of laminating at least two-sheet-shaped materials having a gas permeability comprises the steps of superposing 
adjacent sheet-shaped materials one upon another, one of the sheet-shaped materials having a thermoplastic material 

on one surface portion thereof, and laminating the sheet-shaped materials by means of rolls without application of 
pressure in a thicknesswise direction of the sheet-shaped materials during and immediately after contact with a heating 

means for heating the thermoplastic material to its melting point or higher to fuse the same to the other of the gas 
permeable materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
laminating a gas permeable (breathable) sheet material such as a
non-woven fabric, a woven fabric, a knit, a web, a fibrous mat, or a
film material. The present invention particularly
relates to a method of heat laminating such gas permeable sheet
materials together into an integrated laminate form with
keeping their gas permeability.The present invention also relates to a method of
laminating of a sheet material having gas permeability which is
used in various industrial fields. The sheet material is used as,
for example, a garment material and a sanitary material, a
packaging material, various filter materials, a building material or
a substrate for an electret material.In a method of laminating a plurality of gas
permeable sheet materials into an integral form which has been
employed for many years, the sheet materials comprising a
thermoplastic material are heated to its melting point or higher
using a heating roll, and a pressure is vertically applied to the
sheet materials using, for example, a nip roll at the same time 
of or immediately after heating the sheet materials along the
thickness direction of the materials so that adhesion through the
melted thermoplastic material is accelerated.However, there is an undesired effect in the above
method that the thermoplastic material is rolled by the nip roll,
whereby many gas permeable pores through the sheet material
are unnecessarily plugged so that original gas permeability of
the sheet material cannot be maintained. With such a method of
the prior art, the gas permeability retention ratio is said to be at
most about 65 %.In order to overcome the above problem, various
methods have been proposed to laminate a plurality of the gas
permeable materials together into the integral form with
keeping their gas permeability. For example, the following
methods can be exemplified:
1) A fusible adhesive is disposed on a gas permeable
material in the form of dots or lines, and then other gas
permeable material is laminated on the gas permeable material;2) A tape or film having thermoplasticity is
disposed on a gas permeable material with a given separation,
and then other gas permeable material is disposed on the gas
permeable material so as to heat laminate them (see, for
example, Japanese Patent Kokai Publication No. 64433/1992 and
Japanese Patent Kokai Publication No. 249739/1987;3) A thermoplastic synthetic resin is spread on a gas 
permeable material or a thermoplastic synthetic resin emulsion
is applied to a
