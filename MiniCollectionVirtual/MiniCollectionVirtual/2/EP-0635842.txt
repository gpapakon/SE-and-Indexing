<ABSTRACT>
A pair of attribute and data is stored in each word 
memory of associative memories. A retrieval is performed 

using reference data applied from an exterior and the pair of 
attribute and data stored in each word memory of associative 

memories. Upon receipt of a match of the attribute, a signal 
representing a match or mismatch of both attribute and data 

except the attribute is supplied to a data line. At the time 
of subsequent retrieval, upon receipt of a match of the 

attribute, data appearing on the data line is taken in.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an associative 
memory having a plurality of word memories each for storing 
storage data in units of words, in which a retrieval of the 
word memories storing predetermined storage data is performed 
using applied reference data. Hitherto, there has been proposed an associative 
memory or a content addressable memory provided with the 
retrieval function as mentioned above. Fig. 14 is a circuit block diagram of the 
conventional associative memory by way of example. Referring to Fig. 14, an associative memory 10 is 
provided with a number of word memories 11_1, 11_2, ··· 11_n 
each consisting of a m-bit of memory cell, arranged in a 
transverse direction of the figure, a word being expressed 
with "m" bits. Further, the associative memory 10 comprises 
a reference data register 12 which is adapted to latch a word  
 
of reference data when it is applied thereto, and a mask data 
register 13 arranged to store mask data to mask the reference 
data for each bit. A bit pattern of the non-masked data, 
which is the whole excepting one masked on the basis of the 
mask data stored in the mask data register 13 or a specified 
part, among the reference data latched in the reference data 
register 12 is compared with a bit pattern of the portion 
corresponding to the bit pattern of the latched reference 
data with respect to data stored in each of the word memories 
11_1, 11_2, ···, 11_n. As a result of the comparison, if 
there are found any of the word memories 11_1, 11_2, ···, 11_n of which the bit pattern is coincident with that of the 
reference data, a match signal expressed as a logic "1" will 
appear on the associated ones of match lines 14_1, 14_2, ···, 
14_n which are provided in conjunction with the word memories 
11_1, 11_2, ···, 11_n, respectively. On the other hand, a 
mismatch signal expressed as a logic "0" will appear on the 
remaining ones of the match lines 14_1, 14 2, ···, 14_n. The signals supplied to the match lines 14_1, 14_2, 
···, 14_n are stored in match flag registers 15_1, 15_2, ···, 
15_n, respectively. Now, assuming that the signals "0", "1", 
" 1", "0", ···, "0", "0" appear on the match flag registers 
15_1, 15_2, ···, 15_n, respectively, these signals are applied 
to an address encoder 16. The address encoder 16 is so  
 
arranged to output an address signal corresponding to the 
highest priority match flag register given with a highest 
priority among the match flag registers (here, only two match 
flag registers 15_2 and 15_3) which store the
