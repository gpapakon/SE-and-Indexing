Peristaltic pump comprising a motor body (4), a cassette (1) with a 
deformable tube (25) and a casing (31) in which are provided rotary rollers 

(15) driven by a driving shaft (10) of the motor body (4) and which 
compress the tube (25), characterized in that it comprises an error preventing 

assembly having a platen (2) with an active position in which the driving 
shaft (10) actuates the rotary rollers (15) and a rest position in which the 

rotary rollers (15) are fixed and at least one finger (23) arranged on the 
lower part (14) of the cassette (1), allowing passing the platen (2) from the 

rest position to the active position. 
Peristaltic pump according to claim 1, characterized in that the pump 
motor body (4) comprises at least one groove (5) whereas the platen (2) 

comprises at least one slide (3) liable of a transverse motion, the engaging of 
the slide (3) into the groove (5) causing the platen (2) to be locked in rest 

position, at least one finger (23) of the casing (31) actuating the slide (3) in 
order to cause said slide to move and to allow the platen (2) to pass from 

one position to the another. 
Peristaltic pump according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the slide (3) is linked to at least one elastic element (27) which brings it 

back to the engaging position into the groove (5) of the pump body (4). 
Peristaltic pump according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that one finger (23) of the cassette (1) comprises a tilted plane (8) 

provided to act on the slide (3) to move it away from the engaging position 
into the groove (5) of the pump body (4).  

 
Peristaltic pump according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that each slide (3) comprises a window (32) provided to receive one 

finger (23) of the cassette (1). 
Peristaltic pump according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the platen (2) comprises an upper plane surface (33), a cylindrical 

side flank (34), the upper plane surface (33) having a central opening (35) 
for the passage of the motor shaft (10) and windows (26) each provided for 

the passage of one of the fingers (23) of the cassette (1), the cylindrical side 
flank (34) comprising notches (36) each provided for the passage of one of 

the slides (3), said slides (3) moving in rails (28) arranged at the lower 
surface of the platen (2). 
Peristaltic pump according to one of claims 5 or 6, characterized in 
that the position of the window (32) of each slide (3) determines the type of 

cassette (1) liable of passing the platen (2) from one position to the other. 
Peristaltic pump according to the claim 1, wherein the cassette (1) 
comprises an input joining piece (37) and an output joining piece (38), each 

traversed by the flexible hose (25), characterized in that it comprises a 
guiding tube (16) made of two drilled cylindrical elements (39, 40) in order 

to allow the circulation of the liquid and each having a male section (41) 
engaging one end of the flexible hose (25) and a male or female section (42) 

provided to accommodate an external hose, the male section (41) ensuring 
the jamming of the flexible hose (25) in the matching joining piece (37, 38) 

by using at least one upper boss (48) and one lower boss (49) located at the 
end of the cassette (1).  

 
Peristaltic pump according to the claim 8, characterized in that both 
cylindrical elements (39, 40) are interdependent and comprise at least one 

claw (43) ensuring their fastening on the cassette (1).
