<ABSTRACT>
There is described an implant for the selective opening and closing of tubular organs of the body, especially of the urethra (2), with an elongate valve body (1) that can be introduced into the tubular body organ. The valve body comprises a locking device which can be selectively locked or released. For this purpose, the valve body (1) possesses an elastic hose section (9) in which there is an inflation body (10) which can be inflated by a fluid and then seals the lumen of the hose section (9). By actuating a pump device (15), which can likewise be implanted, the fluid can be transported from the inflation body (10) into a storage tank (8). The inflation body (10) in the form of an inner hose piece is then deflated and unblocks the passage. After manual actuation (15) of a non-return valve in the pump device (5) the fluid, preferably a liquid, flows under pressure from the storage tank (8) into the inflation body (10) and seals the valve body (1).

An implantable device for the selective opening or closing
of a tubular body organ, in particular the urethra (2), with the

following features:

a tubing section (9);
an inflatable body (10) which is attached within the tubing
section (9) and is inflatable by a fluid in order to assume the

closure position of the device or which may be emptied in order
to assume the release position of the device;

characterised by the following design,

the tubing section (9) comprises an outer diameter which is
fittingly selected for implantation in the tubular body organ (2)

so that after implantation the tubular body organ (2) surrounds
the tubing section (9);
the inflatable body (10) is formed by an inner tubing piece (11)
which at both ends (11a) is closed and which with its outer

surface over its length and on a part of its periphery is
connected to the inner side of the tubing section (11),
wherein the ends (11a) of the inner tubing section (11) are
pressed flat and adhesed;
the inflatable body (10) sealingly bears on the tubing section
(9) in order to effect the closure position.
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
flatly pressed ends (11a) of the inner tubing sections (11) run

out in a wedged manner (11c) so that without a step they blend
into the wall of the tubing section (9).
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
there is provided a tubing (4) which for feeding the fluid opens

out in the middle region of the inner tubing piece (11).
A device according to claim 3, 4 or 5, characterised in that
in the opening-out region of the feed tubing (4) there is applied

a flange connection piece (12) which leads through the connected
tubing walls, engages behind these and is adhesed to them.
A device according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the tubing section (8) consists of elastic

plastic, preferably silicon rubber and is provided with a tissue
inlay or overlay which limits a diameter enlargement of the

tubing section (9).
A device according to one of the claims 1 to 5,
characterised by an implantable, manually operable pump means (5)

which for the delivery of the fluid via a or the tubing (4) is
connected to the inflatable body (10)
A device according to claim 6, characterised in that to the
pump means (5) there is likewise connected an implantable supply

vessel (8), that the pump means (5) comprises a return valve
which lies in the feed conduit to the supply vessel (8) and is

externally manually actuatable, in a manner such that on
actuation of the pump means (5) fluid is suctioned from the

inflatable body (10) and conveyed into the supply vessel (8) and
the inflatable body (10) amid the release of the through-flow

through the tubing section (9) collapses and

that on actuation of the return valve fluid under the influence
of the pressure in the supply vessel (8) flows into the

inflatable body (10) and blocks the through-flow in the tubing
section (9).
A device according to claim 7, characterised in that the
fluid quantity which is filled into the system consisting of the

supply container (8), the inflatable body (1), the pump means (5)
and the connection tubings (4,7) is just sufficient to bring the

inflatable body (10) into the closure position.
