<ABSTRACT>
An engine noise control apparatus which is 
capable of effectively reducing or waveform-reshaping a 

wide range of engine noise. The apparatus has an engine 
rotating speed sensor (5) for detecting an engine 

rotating speed and a waveform generator circuit (46) for 
converting a rotation pulse signal to a periodic signal 

having a frequency which is a predetermined multiple of 
the detected engine rotating speed. The output of an air 

flow meter (3) is passed through a bandpass filter (41) 
and a rectifier circuit (42) to generate a control signal 

which is an average value of alternating current 
components of the output. A CPU (44), with reference to 

a map previously stored in a memory (45), modifies the 
phase and amplitude of the periodic signal with respect 

to an engine rotation reference signal based on the 
rotation pulse signal and the control signal, and outputs 

the modified signal as driving signals to operate 
speakers (6A, 6B) disposed in an intake tube and an 

exhaust tube for reducing noise.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an engine 
noise control apparatus, and more particularly to a noise 
control apparatus which generates control sound in order 
to cancel noise or convert the noise into a favorable 
tone. As noise sources of a vehicle, intake sound and 
exhaust sound may be pointed out. Conventionally, a 
variety of resonators have been used to reduce intake 
sound, while mufflers have been used to reduce exhaust 
sound. However, although these conventional noise 
control apparatuses mainly based on the resonance effect 
are effective in reducing limited noise near a resonance 
frequency, they do not provide sufficient noise 
preventing effects for engine noise which lies over a 
relatively wide frequency range. The present invention has been made to solve 
the above-mentioned problem, and its object is to provide 
an engine noise control apparatus which is capable of  
 
effectively reducing a wide range of engine noise or 
converting the waveform of such engine noise. According to the present invention as shown in 
Fig. 11, there is provided an engine noise control 
apparatus comprising means for detecting an engine 
rotating speed; periodic signal generation means for 
generating an oscillation signal having a frequency which 
is a predetermined multiple of the detected engine 
rotating speed; means for detecting pulsation components 
of intake air supplied to the engine; means for 
generating a control signal in accordance with the 
magnitude of the detected pulsation components of the 
intake air supplied to the engine; means for detecting a 
reference position in rotation of the engine and for 
outputting a reference position signal; means for 
modulating the phase and amplitude of the oscillation 
signal with respect to a reference position signal based 
on the engine rotating speed and the control signal, and 
outputting the modulated oscillation signal as a driving 
signal; and sound generation means disposed in at least 
one of intake sound and exhaust sound propagation paths 
of the engine for generating control sound in accordance 
with the driving signal. A main frequency component causing engine 
intake sound and exhaust sound is a frequency which is a 
predetermined multiple (order) of an engine rotating 
speed which is defined by the number of cylinders and so  
 
on. The periodic signal generation means multiplies the 
engine rotating speed by a predetermined number 
previously determined from the number of cylinders and so 
on, to generate the periodic signal at the
