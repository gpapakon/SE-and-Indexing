<ABSTRACT>
Module for rapidly interconnecting two single-pole (unipolar) telephone lines (15, 23) using metal contacts (43, 50) with insulation-displacement slits (45, 52). It includes a base element (11) which is fixed to the receiving metal rail (1) and which ensures connection of the incoming leads (15), an intermediate element (21) which contains the major part of the connector assembly, an upper element (18) having a master screw (17) which ensures connection of the outgoing leads (23), and a fourth element (22) which is a five-pole plug-in unit forming a receptacle for an electrical circuit which forms at least electrical-continuity jumpers (32, 33), but which may also, for example, receive an overvoltage protection device (37) as well as, possibly, other additional components.

module for the rapid interconnection of two monopair telephone 
lines (15, 23),
 
characterized in that it is constituted by four elements adapted to be assembled on 

a metal rail (1) for support and grounding: 

a first element (11), or base element for connection of the incoming 
line, which is fixed on this metal rail (1), and which at least comprises 

two channels (14) for introduction of the two wires (15) of the 
incoming line, means (8, 9, 10) further being provided to connect to 

the metal rail (1) a metal contact (19) for grounding which traverses 
this base element (11); 
a second element (21), or intermediate element, which covers the first 
element (11) and which contains the major part (43 to 52) of the 

connections for linkage between these two telephone lines (15, 23), 
these connections being in the form of rigid or semi-rigid metal pieces, 

which are fitted in this intermediate element, a discontinuity (24, 25) of 
electrical linkage being, however, made therein for each of the two line 

links (46-48, 47-49), and these connections necessarily comprising, on 
the one hand, two metal contacts (43, 44) each with at least one self-stripping 

slot (45) which are prominent in the direction of the metal rail 
(1) so as to receive, in self-stripping connection action, the two said 

wires (15) of the incoming line previously introduced in said channels 
(14) of said base element (11), and necessarily comprising, on the other 

hand, two other metal contacts (50, 51) each with at least one self-stripping 
slot (52) which are, a contrario, prominent in the direction 

opposite the metal rail (1) so as to be able to receive, in self-stripping 
connection action, the two wires (23) of the outgoing line, which are to 

be connected to the two respective wires (15) of said incoming line;  
 
a third element (18), or upper element for connection of the outgoing 
line (23), which is constituted, in manner kn
own per se, as an upper 
half-bush for rapid, self-stripping connection of a monopair line, and 

which is therefore conventionally provided with two parallel channels 
(26) for receiving and guiding the two strands (23) of line to be 

connected, this third element (18) covering a first part (211) of the 
second element by mounting, in cooperation with self-striping 

connection action, said other two self-stripping metal contacts (50, 
51), and this third element (18) being conventionally traversed by a 

screw (17), median and perpendicular to the metal rail (1), which also 
completely traverses the second element (21) as well as at least a part 

of the first element (11) to screw in a nut (16) or tapping, in that case 
forcing the said three elements (11, 21, 18) to come together and 

consequently ensuring, the self-stripping connection of the four line 
strands (15, 23); 
and a fourth element (22) which covers, by fitting, the remaining part 
(210) of the second element (21), thus being positioned side by side 

with the third element (18) and substantially at the same level as the 
latter, this fourth element (22) thus fitting by five terminals (131, 32 to 

35) for electrical connection, of which one terminal (131) for linkage to 
said metal grounding contact (19) which itself traverses the first (11) 

and the second element (21), and of which two other pairs of terminals 
(32, 33 and 34, 35) which are respectively connected to each 

respective side of said two discontinuities (24, 25) for electrical linkage 
which are provided in the second element (21), and this fourth element 

(22) forming receptacle for an electric circuit (41, 42 of 411, 421, 36, 
37) which is connected on these five terminals (131, 32 to 35) and 

which at the minimum ensures the two missing electrical linkages, by 
reason of said discontinuities (24, 25), in the connections contained in 

the second element (21). 
Module according to Claim 1, characterized in that its self-stripping 
contacts (43, 44, 50, 51) are made in the form of blades. 
Module according to Claim 2, characterized in that the two self-stripping 
contacts (50, 51) which are associated with the outgoing line strands (23) 

present a sufficient elasticity for their self-stripping slot (52) to move apart, during 
the introduction in this slot of the core of the line strand (23), after stripping of this 

strand by said slot. 
Module according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that all 
the connections thereinside are made in the form of cut-out metal blades (19, 46 to 

48, 43, 44, 50, 51, 131, 36, 32-41-33, 34-42-35, 32-411-33, 34-421-35). 
Module according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the 
fourth element (22) is formed as a receptacle for an overvoltage arrester (37). 
Module according to on e of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 
the fourth element receives a circuit (61 to 64) for protection against overvoltages 

which at least comprises a resistor with positive temperature coefficient (61, 62) in 
series on each line wire. 
Module according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the 
inner part of the channels (26) for introduction of the outgoing lines (23) in the 

third element (18) is provided with fins (28) for retention of a self-closing sealing 
gel.
