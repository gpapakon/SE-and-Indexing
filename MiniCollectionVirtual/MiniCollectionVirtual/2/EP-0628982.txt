<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a driving method of an electron beam 
emitting device comprising a surface conduction type of thin 

film device having an electron emitting area and a pair of 
electrodes for passing current through the electron emitting 

area, wherein a track of the emitted electron beam is varied 
by varying a value of a voltage applied between said pair of 

electrodes. The invention also provides a driving method of 
an image displaying devi
ce comprising such an electron beam 
emitting device and a light-emitting member, which is 

irradiated with the electron beam from said electron beam 
emitting device to form a light-emitting image, wherein the 

track of the emitted electron beam is varied in a corresponding 
manner to shift a site to be irradiated with the electron beam 

in said light-emitting member.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for driving electron beam
emitting devices which comprise the device features defined in claim 1 and
to a method for driving an image displaying device comprising
such electron beam emitting devices. Such a method is described
in EP-A-301 545 to be considered within the meaning of EPC Article 54(3) and (4).In recent years, in the field of information
instruments or TV receiver for domestic use, thin type
image displaying device with good visual recognition
has been demanded. In the prior art, as thin type
image displaying device, there have been developed,
for example, liquid crystal displaying device, EL
displaying device, plasma display panel, etc., but
these involve problems in visual angle, color
formation, luminosity, etc., and they cannot be said
to satisfy the performances demanded by the market
under the present situation.Whereas, in the prior art, as the device 
capable of obtaining emission of electrons with a
simple structure, there has been known, for example,
the cold cathode-ray device reported by M.I. Elinson
[Radio Eng. Electron. Phys. vol. 10, 1290 - 1296,
1965]. This utilizes the phenomenon that electron
emission occurs by passing current through the thin
film with small area formed on a substrate in parallel
to the thin surface, and is generally called the
surface conduction type of thin film device.As such surface conduction type of thin film
device, one by use of the SnO2(Sb) thin film developed
by Elinson et al as mentioned above; one by use of Au
thin film [G. Dittmer: "Thin Solid Films", vol. 9, p.
317, 1972]; one by use of ITO film [M. Harwell and
C.G. Fonstad: "IEEE Trans. ED Conf.", p. 519, 1975];
and one by use of carbon thin film [Hisashi Araki et
al: "Vacuum", vol. 26, No. 1, p. 22, 1983] have been
reported.These surface conduction type devices have the
following advantages:
1) High electron emitting efficiency can be
obtained.2) Simple structure affords easy production.3) A large number of devices can be formed
(multi-formation) on the same substrate.Accordingly, if these surface conduction type 
of thin film devices can be utilized as the electron
generating source for the flat plate type CRT image
displaying device, an image displaying device more
excellent in visual angle, color formation, luminosity
and further in low consumption power, etc. as compared
with the flat plate type CRT displaying device can be
provided.However, when the surface conduction type of
thin film device is attempted to be utilized for the
electron generating
