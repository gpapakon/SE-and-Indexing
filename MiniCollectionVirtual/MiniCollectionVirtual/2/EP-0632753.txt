<ABSTRACT>
A method for making a mould used in the manufacture of foundry castings comprises (a) providing a water-insoluble particulate material, such as sand; (b) combining the particulate material with a binder, preferably containing polyphosphate chains and/or borate ions and water; (c) heating the mixture to a temperature in excess of 100 DEG C; (d) forming the mixture into a desired shape; and removing water from the mixture, with air, at a temperature in excess of 100 DEG C. The method ensures that the volatilisation of the water does not cool the mixture and, therefore, the production cycle is hastened and efficiency is improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A Method for Making MouldsThis invention relates to water dispersible moulds which are used in the manufacture of foundry castings. More particularly it relates to a method for making such moulds.The term "mould" as used in this specification includes both a mould for producing castings with or without cavities and a core for producing a cavity in a cavity containing casting and combinations of such moulds and cores.Cores and moulds are made from sand or other refractory particulate materials and it is customary to add binders in order to give the necessary properties of flowability (to enable the core/mould to be formed), stripping strength (to enable the core/mould to be handled soon after forming) and the ultimate strength to withstand the conditions occurring during casting.The refractory particulate material and binder are formed into a core or a mould by various processes which include ramming, pressing, blowing and extruding the mix into a suitable forming means such as a core box, a moulding flask, or a moulding or mould box. 

 Water is present in the mix of refractory particulate material and binder, and must be removed after the core or mould has been formed in the forming means, and before it can be used in the manufacture of foundry castings. In one method, after the mix has been formed into a core in a core box, the core box is heated to a temperature in the range of 50-90βC, and then purged with compressed air at a pressure of 80 pounds per square inch for a period of time in excess of 30 seconds depending on the core size and binder composition.This removal of water by evaporation requires relatively large amounts of heat (ie the latent heat of vaporization) , and so the drying action of the air flow has a cooling effect which hinders further evaporation thereby extending cycle times.Once enough water has been removed from the core so that it can be handled without being damaged, the core is then transferred to an oven where final removal of water is accomplished by heating the core to a temperature in the range 120-150°C.According to an aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for making a mould used in the manufacture of foundry castings, the method comprising the steps of:(a) providing a water insoluble particulate material;(b) combining the particulate material with a binder;(c) heating the mixture of particulate material and binder to a temperature in excess of 100°C; 

(d) forming the particulate material and binder mixture into a desired shape;(e) removing water

(a) providing a water insoluble particulate material;
(b) combining the particulate material with a binder;
(c) heating the mixture of particulate material and binder to a temperature in excess of 100°C;
(d) forming the particulate material and binder mixture into a desired shape;
(e) removing water from the mixture with air at a temperature in excess of 100°C.
2. A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the water insoluble particulate material is heated prior to being mixed.
3. A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the steps (b) to (d) are carried out in a saturated atmosphere of steam.
4. A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the water insoluble particulate material is foundry sand.
5. A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the binder includes polyphosphate chains and/or borate ions.
6. A method as claimed in claim 5, wherein the polyphosphate chains and/or borate ions have been respectively derived from at least one water soluble phosphate and/or borate glass.
7. A method as claimed in claim 6 wherein in step (b) the binder which is mixed with the particulate material is in the form of an aqueous solution of the at least one water soluble glass. 


8. A method as claimed in claim 6 wherein in step (b) the binder which is mixed with the particulate material is in the form of particles of the at least one water soluble glass and the polyphosphate chains and/or borate ions are formed by mixing water with the mixture of particulate material and glass particles.
9. A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein in step (b) the binder comprises at least 0.25% by weight, and the particulate material comprises up to 99.75% by weight of the total weight of the mixture particulate material and the binder.
10. A method for making a mould used in the manufacture of foundry castings substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to, and as illustrated in Figure 1.
