<ABSTRACT>
Radio alarm systems with a multiplicity of channels for transmitting messages between glass break detector, break detector (opening detector) and the like, and a microprocessor-controlled central unit are known. The individual channels are formed in this case in accordance with the time-division multiplex system or by using the frequency-division multiplex system. In order to increase interference immunity in a simple manner and to allow at the same time the interference-free transmission of messages via the different channels, the channels are formed in the transmission direction from the detectors (sensors) to the central unit by using frequency hopping. The spread (expanded) channels thus formed are subsequently superposed on one another and converted to a single carrier frequency.

Radio alarm system having a multiplicity of message
channels for transmitting signals in the form of data

telegrams between signallers, switching devices and also
control devices, in particular automatic dialling

appliances for alarm-raising devices, and a microprocessor-controlled
central unit, characterized in that, in the

transmission direction from the signallers (M) to the
central unit (ZE), the message channels are formed using

the frequency hopping method, the messages being broadcast
with a specifiable repetition period and the expanded

message channels thus formed then being mutually
superimposed and converted into a frequency band.
Radio alarm system according to Claim 1, characterized
in that pseudo-random hopping frequencies are used for the

expansion.
Radio alarm system according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that a single common radio transmission

band is used for transmitting items of information in the
reverse direction.
Radio alarm system according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that every data telegram has blocks having

equally long code words and in that the data telegrams are
sent asynchronously and repeatedly from the signallers (M)

to the central unit or from the central unit to the alarm
emitter(s).
Radio alarm system according to one or more of Claims
1 to 4, characterized in that the central unit (ZE) has a

synchronizer (K) which is adjusted to the expanded code to
be evaluated by means of a microprocessor (MP) and an

evaluation unit (AE), connected to the latter, and on the
basis of the expanded code stored in a memory (SP).
