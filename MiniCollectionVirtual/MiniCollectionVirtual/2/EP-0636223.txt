<ABSTRACT>
Means for switching off a bath tap (20) when the water reaches a predetermined level comprise a float (8; 17) mounted on a pivoted arm (6; 16). As the float rises a closure member (5; 18) on the arm blocks the outlet from the tap.

<DESCRIPTION>
 VA VED OUTLET The present invention relates to a valved outlet for use in filling a bath.The present invention aims to provide a device so that water can be left to fill a bath and the flow of water can be turned off automatically when the bath is filled to a desired level.According to the present invention, there is provided a device for filling a bath comprising: a housing having a channel therethrough and an inlet and an outlet, valve means operable to close the outlet, a float, means for supporting the float in the bath, and means responsive to the level of the float to shut the valve means when the float reaches a predetermined level.In a preferred arrangement, the float is mounted on an arm that is pivotally connected to the housing, and the movement of the arm as the float rises closes the valve.Preferably, the float is mounted on a first end of the arm outside the housing, the second end of the arm extending into the housing; the device further comprising a closure member that is mounted on or adjacent to the second end of the arm that is movable to block the channel.Preferably, the closure member, arm and float are arranged so that when the bath is empty the arm hangs downwards under the weight of the float and in this position the closure member clears the water channel allowing the flow of water through the outlet and as the float rises the arm moves thereby moving the closure member in the channel and closing the outlet. 

The outlet of the present invention may be permanently incorporated in a tap for the bath but preferably includes a tap adaptor arranged to mount the valved outlet onto an existing tap.A further connection may be provided from the channel defined by the housing to a second tap. With such a connection the outlet functions as a "mixer" outlet, enabling the provision of water at a desired temperature. Alternatively, a separate valved outlet may be provided for each of the hot and cold water taps.Examples of embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:Fig. 1 shows a partly sectioned side elevation of a first embodiment of the invention;Fig. 2 shows a partly sectioned side elevation of a second embodiment of the invention; andFig. 3 shows a partly sectioned side elevation of a third embodiment of the invention in the open and closed positions.Fig. 1 shows a valved outlet for use in the water supply to a bath and includes a generally cylindrical housing 1 which is injection moulded from plastics

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS
1. A device for use in filling a bath comprising: a housing (1:20) having a channel therethrough and an inlet (2) and an outlet (4) , valve means (5,6,9; 11,12,18) operable to close the outlet, a float (8;17), means (6;16) for supporting the float in the bath, and means (6;12) responsive to the level of the float to shut the valve means when the float reaches a predetermined level.
2. A device according to claim 1, wherein the float (8;17) is mounted on an arm (6;16) that is pivotally connected to the housing (1;20), and the movement of the arm as the float rises closes the valve means (5,6,9; 11,12,18).
3. A device according to claim 2, wherein the float (8;17) is mounted on a first end of the arm (6;16) that is outside the housing (1;20), the second end of the arm extending into the housing; the device further comprising a closure member (5;18) that is mounted on or adjacent to the second end of the arm that is movable to block the channel.
4. A device according to claim 3, wherein the closure member (5;18), arm (6;16) and float (8;17) are arranged so that when the bath is empty the arm hangs downwards under the weight of the float and in this position the closure member clears the channel allowing the flow of water through the outlet and as the float rises the arm moves thereby moving the closure member in the channel and closing the outlet.
5. A device according to any of claims 2 to 4 wherein the position of the float (8;17) on the arm (6;16) can be varied to alter said predetermined level. 


6. A device according to any preceding of claims 3 to 5, wherein the closure member (18) is biased in a position to prevent water flowing through the outlet.
7. A device according to any preceding claim, wherein the outlet is permanently incorporated in a tap.
8. A device according to any of claims 1 to 5,further comprising a tap adaptor (3) arranged to mount the valved outlet onto an existing tap.
9. A device according to claim 8, wherein the housing is connected to two taps.
10. Bath filling means comprising hot and cold taps, and two devices according to any of claims l to 8.
