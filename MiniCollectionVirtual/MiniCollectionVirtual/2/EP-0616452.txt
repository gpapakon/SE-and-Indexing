<ABSTRACT>
A digital filter bank for the frequency multiplex signal 
sampled and composed of L individual signals of a band-width 

B,wherein the frequency multiplex signal at the input is a 
complex value composed of the real and the imaginary portion 

which are each fed into identical arrangements, which are each 
composed of an input demultiplexer having M positions, with a 

chain of delay members, the input demultiplexer cyclically 
distributes the input signal values to successive chains, so 

that the input signal sequence is divided into M partial 
sequences at a sampling rate which has been reduced by M; 

wherein a plurality of digital filter banks are arranged in a 
tree structure and separation into individual signals occurs 

with the sampling rate being reduced in each stage 
characterized in that one HMM-Cell for each stage in the tree 

is used and that multiplexed data processing is being carried 
out for real and impaginary parts and for data of different 

subbands but is confined to one stage of the tree. (Fig. 1) 
The filter banks tree is part of a multicarrier demodulator to 

be used in the return link from mobile vehicles to the earth-station 
of a future satellite communication system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for digital FDM demultiplexing using digital
filter banks in accordance to the preamble of claim 1.Digital filter banks are known from the publications " A Modular Multistage
Approach to Digital FDM Demultiplexing for Mobile SCPC Satellite
Communications" by Göckler in the International Journal of Satellite
Communications, Volume 6, pages 283 - 288 (1988) and "Simulation of an
Onboard Hierarchical Multistage Digital FDM Demultiplexer for Mobile SCPC
Satellite Communications" by Helmut Eyssele and Heinz Göckler in the
International Journal of Satellite Communications, Volume 8, pages 79 - 93,
1990.Depending on the filter characteristic and the word length of the signal
representation digital filter banks become very complex leading to large chip area
requirements and high power consumption. Particularly in satellite
communications power and space consumption are crucial criteria in assessing
the usefulness of a concept. In this application minimum power consumption was
the design goal along with the requirement to fit the complete design into 35000
gates. Although the specifications of the European Space Agency required the
design to run at just 320 kHz the chip is actually capable of running at 20 MHz
system clock speed. EP 308 649 discloses a digital filter tree composed of a plurality of digital filter
banks arranged in a tree structure where each node of each stage has two
successor filter banks connected. All filter banks are identical. The frequency
multiplex signal input to the first stage is real valued and its sampling rate is
decimated by a factor of two.This invention aims at a method for digital FDM demultiplexing that requires
fewer computational elements and leads to a reduced chip area and a reduced
power consumption.The solution is the method as characterized in the claims.The description of the invention is supported by the figures. First the HMM-Cells (same as filter bank) are described as shown in the block
diagram of Fig. 1 and in greater detail in Fig. 2.The purpose of a single HMM-Cell is to demultiplex a complex-valued FDM-Signal
into two subbands with the effect that the number of subband doubles and
their respective sampling rate and the bandwidth carried by a signal is decimated
by two.The gate count in the ASIC can be significantly reduced for the signal processing
elements if only a single HMM-Cell is deployed in each stage of the tree. This
concept leads to a time-multiplex HMM structure. Multiplexed data processing is
being carried out for

<CLAIMS>
A method for digital FDM demultiplexing by a hierarchical multistage digital
FDM Demultiplexer wherein a plurality of digital filter banks is used consisting

of HMM-Cells which are arranged one behind the other to branch out in
successive steps into a tree structure in accordance with the Hierarchical

Multistage Method (HMM) where, starting with the first stage, each HMM-Cell

is to demultiplex a respective complex valued FDM-Signal into two subbands
with the sampling rate being reduced each time, characterized by the following

items:

in each HMM-Cell by itself multiplexed data processing is carried out for real
and imaginary signal parts and for data of different subbands,
at the input of each HMM-Cell a switching circuit alternately feeds the odd and
the even tap delay line of the HMM-Cell with data originating from successive

time instants respectively,
from one hierarchy level to the next inside a HMM-Cell the number of delay
elements between two coefficient taps double,
each of the second and following HMM-Cells is fed with a multiplex signal
carrying a multitude of subbands.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that all delay lines of the HMM-Cells
with more than two delay elements are implemented using a FIFO memory.
