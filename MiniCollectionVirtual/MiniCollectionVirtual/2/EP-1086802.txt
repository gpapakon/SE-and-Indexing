<ABSTRACT>
Press comprises a connecting rod (3), a crankshaft (4), an eccentric crank mechanism connected to a toothed wheel (5) to drive the upper stamping unit (2), and an electronic control on the reverse drive of the crankshaft. The toothed wheel is driven by at least one motor (7.1, 7.2) via a screw drive (6.1, 6.2). An Independent claim is also included for a process for operating the press. Preferred Features: The motor is a hydraulic motor.

<CLAIMS>
A press for pressing powdered substances, in particular metal powder, comprising an eccentric crank mechanism, having at least one connecting rod (3) and a crankshaft (4) and a gear wheel (5) connected non-rotationally to the latter, for driving an upper punch unit (2), the gear wheel (5) being able to be driven via at least one worm drive (6.1, 6.2) by at least one motor (7.1, 7.2), and comprising an electronic control means, 
characterised in that
 the electronic control means is arranged for a reversing operation of the crankshaft (4).
A press according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the control means is arranged such that during the working and idle strokes the crankshaft (4) is turned over an angular range of less than 180Â°.
A press according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 two worm drives (6.1, 6.2) are provided.
A press according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the worm drives (6.1, 6.2) can each be driven by separate motors (7.1, 7.2).
A press according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 the at least one motor (7.1, 7.2) is in the form of a hydraulic motor.
A press according to one of Claims 3 to 5, 
characterised in that
 the two worm drives (6.1, 6.2) are diametrically opposed with respect to the axis of rotation of the gear wheel (5).
A press according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 the electronic control means is arranged such that the bottom dead centre of the eccentric crank mechanism is overrun by a small amount to reach the end pressing position (end of the working stroke).
A press according to one of Claims 5 to 7, 
characterised in that
 the electronic control means is arranged such that the two hydraulic motors (7.1, 7.2) can be connected alternatively in parallel and in series with respect to the supply of hydraulic medium thereto.
A press according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that
 the press comprises a die (9) which can be displaced in controlled manner by hydraulic cylinders.
A press according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that
 the press comprises a hydraulically operated tool adapter.
A press according to one of Claims 9 to 11, 
characterised in that
 a central electric motor is provided for jointly driving the hydraulic pumps for supplying pressure to the hydraulic motors (7.1, 7.2) for driving the upper punch unit (2) and for the hydraulic cylinders of the die (9) and/or the hydraulically actuated tool adapter.
A press according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that
 an electronic path measurement system is provided for detecting the current position of the upper punch unit (2).
A press according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that
 an electronic angle of rotation transmitter is provided for detecting the current position of the crankshaft (4).
A press according to one of Claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that
 the stroke of the upper punch unit (2) is reversible in each case shortly before reaching the top and/or bottom dead centre of the eccentric crank mechanism.
