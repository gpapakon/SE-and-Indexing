<ABSTRACT>
In a method for improving the dynamic performance and increasing the power of supercharged diesel engines, which drive a variable pitch propeller, the pitch of the variable pitch propeller is first of all reduced until the diesel engine and hence also the variable pitch propeller has attained the new increased set speed. Only then is the fuel injection quantity and thereby the power (L) of the diesel engine increased and the pitch of the variable pitch propeller increased again with the subsequent increase of the injection quantity, as far as possible in such a way that the new set speed previously attained is maintained.
