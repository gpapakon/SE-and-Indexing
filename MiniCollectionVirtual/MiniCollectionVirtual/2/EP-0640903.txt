<ABSTRACT>
A video camera or equivalent sensor is mounted on 
a vehicle and used to detect the lane markings on the 

road (usually the white painted lines). An associated 
signal processor (11) estimates the vehicle's lateral 

position in relation to the lane markings. An electric 
motor (4) coupled to the steering mechanism (1) is used 

to provide a torque input to the steering which may 
either assist or oppose the steering torque from the 

driver. The processor (11) is designed to assist the 
driver to maintain the vehicle's lane position by 

holding the vehicle at a set-point using a biasing 
torque. This simulates the effect of the lane being 

cambered upwards towards the lane edges. However the 
driver is able to override or cancel the effect if the 

driver applied steering torque exceeds a prescribed 
torque threshold.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a driver 
assistance system for a vehicle adapted to control the 
direction of a moving vehicle along a predetermined 
path. A recent U.S. study shows that 25% of all road 
accidents are caused by unintended road or lane 
departures. Mounting evidence suggests that many of 
the accidents are caused by drivers falling asleep, 
although it is difficult to prove, as many drivers will 
not admit to this. Automatic lane following systems 
have been demonstrated operating at motorway speeds, 
since 1985. Such systems certainly prevent lane 
departure while lane markings are present, but do not 
prevent drivers falling asleep. Indeed, there is a 
danger that a reduced driver workload could even 
encourage drowsiness. Presently drivers are required to maintain 
significant concentration and co-ordination to maintain 
a central position between lane markings, especially 
with variations of road camber, road curvature, and 
cross winds. EP-A-0 514 343 discloses an automatic lateral 
guidance control system for guiding moving vehicles. 
The system includes a sensing subsystem for viewing an 
area in front of a vehicle, a plurality of energy 
radiating or energy reflective devices disposed 
adjacent a predetermined length of road, an apparatus 
for translating the radiating or reflected information 
from the viewed area into co-ordinate data representing 
an approximation of the predetermined path along the 
road, and a vehicle controller for determining the  
 
vehicle's heading with respect to the approximated path 
and providing an output control signal to correct the 
vehicle's heading with respect to the approximated 
path. The system uses past and present position data 
to calculate a predetermined path for the vehicle. 
Gain factors and comfort factors are determined to 
maximise comfort for passengers of the system and to 
optimise performance of the system. The automatic 
guidance control system of EP-A-0 514 343 is adapted to 
control the direction of a moving vehicle without the 
need for human intervention and the system is more 
responsive than the control provided by the operator of 
the vehicle. According to our invention a method of tracking a 
contrived centre line between lane markings of a road 
characterised in that a steering bias is applied to the 
steering system of the vehicle in such a manner as to 
assist the driver in tracking the contrived centre line 
position. The contrived centre line may be the true centre 
line between lane markings, for example
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of tracking a contrived centre line 
between lane markings of a road characterised in that a 

steering bias is applied to the steering system of the 
vehicle in such a manner as to assist the driver in 

tracking the contrived centre line position. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the level of steering bias applied to the steering 

system is relatively small when the track of the 

vehicle is in proximity to the contrived centre line 
and the steering bias is adapted to be increased as the 

vehicle approaches the boundaries defined by the lane 
markings. 
A method according to any preceding claim 
characterised in that a steering torque ripple is 

applied by the steering system as the vehicle 
approaches a lane boundary. 
A method according to any preceding claim 
characterised in that an audio signal is produced to 

alert the driver of a possible lane boundary 
infringement. 
A method according to claim 4 in which the audio 
signal appears from the area of the lane boundary 

infringement. 
A method according to claim 4 or claim 5 
characterised in that the conventional audio system of 

the vehicle is utilised to produce the simulated 
infringement signal. 
A method according to any preceding claim  
 

characterised in that if the lane marking signals are 
lost, a warning is issued to the driver and the system 

is disabled. 
A method according to any preceding claim 
characterised in that the system incorporates means for 

cancelling the steering bias when a direction indicator 
of the vehicle is actuated. 
Apparatus for maintaining the position of the 
vehicle with respect to the lane markings characterised 

in that lane markings are detected by the use of a 
video camera or equivalent sensor mounted on the 

vehicle which is "light sensitive" or of the 
"infra-red" sensing type, an associated signal 

processor estimates the lateral position of the vehicle 
in relation to the lane markings, an electric motor 

coupled to the steering mechanism is used to provide a 
torque input to the steering system. 
Apparatus according to claim 9 characterised in 
that the driver is able to override or cancel the 

effect if the steering torque applied to the steering 
system by the driver exceeds a predetermined torque 

threshold. 
Apparatus according to claim 9 or claim 10 
characterised in that the system supplements the 

existing power steering mechanism whilst also providing 
a failure back-up in the event of engine stall or pump 

drive failure.
