Process for the preparation of derivatives of 
formula: 


 
in which R denotes an alkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, polyfluoroalkyl, 

polyfluoroalkoxy, alkenyl, phenyl, alkylsulphonyl, 
alkoxycarbonyl, amino, cyano, sulphonamido or 

dialkylcarbamoyl radical, characterized in that a derivative 
of formula: 


 
in which R has the same meanings as in formula (I) is 

reacted in an inert solvent, with nitronium tetrafluoroborate. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the inert solvent is acetonitrile or tetramethylene 

sulphone. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the operation is carried out at a 

temperature of between 10 and 30°C. 
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the operation is carried out at a temperature of  

 
approximately 20°C. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that 1 to 4 moles of nitronium tetrafluoroborate 

are employed per mole of derivative of 
formula (II). 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that 2 moles of nitronium tetrafluoroborate are employed. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the reaction period is between 6 

and 48 hours. 
Compounds of formula: 

 
in which R denotes an alkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, polyfluoroalkyl, 

polyfluoroalkoxy, alkenyl, phenyl, alkylsulphonyl, 
alkoxycarbonyl, amino, cyano, sulphonamido or 

dialkylcarbamoyl radical.
