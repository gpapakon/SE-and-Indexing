<ABSTRACT>
Stable, compatible, resin fortified aqueous vinyl 
polymer emulsions that are rich in wax are prepared in a 

method comprising a first polymerization of a mixture 
containing wax and monomers that include carboxylated 

monomers such as acrylic acid. The first polymerization 
or terpolymerization is carried out under conditions 

sufficient to produce a relatively low molecular weight 
resin. A portion of the wax rich resin from the first 

polymerization is neutralized and used as a cosurfactant 
in a second aqueous emulsion polymerization of vinyl 

monomers to produce a fortified vinyl latex that is rich 
in wax. Coatings prepared from the latex exhibit 

superior moisture barrier properties and are also useful 
as surface preservatives.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel process for 
production of stable aqueous emulsions of vinyl polymers, 
herein referred to as vinyl latices, that are rich in 
paraffinic wax and fortified with low molecular weight, 
carboxylated resins. The vinyl latices are prepared by 
addition polymerization of vinyl monomers in an aqueous 
emulsion mixture containing the aqueous reaction product 
of the addition polymerization of a mixture of monomers 
which also contain a carboxylated vinyl monomer and a 
substantial quantity of paraffinic wax. The resultant 
paraffin-rich, resin-fortified vinyl latices are useful 
for the preparation of coatings having especially low 
moisture permeability. The free radical initiated polymerization of vinyl 
monomers in aqueous emulsions is a process well known in 
the polymer field and described in such classic 
references as "Emulsion Polymerization" by F. A. Bovey, 
et al., Interscience Publishers, N. Y, 1955 and in the 
Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology. The 
vinyl latices are prepared by suspending one or more 
monomers in water in contact with a surfactant and a free 
radical initiator such as ammonium persulfate. 
Surfactants commonly employed include ethoxylated 
polypropylene glycol, ethoxylated nonyl phenol, etc. 
Mixtures of various surfactants can be employed including 
the ammonium or alkali salts of low molecular weight 
polymers containing carboxy groups. The use of such low 
molecular weight carboxylated polymers as cosurfactant 
typically leads to the characterization of the resultant 
polymer vinyl latex as a fortified or resin-fortified 
latex.  
 Artisans engaged in the development of inks and 
surface coatings derived from polymer latices are 
continually challenged by the need to modify the latex 
formulations to enhance properties required for the end-user 
application. Of these modifications, the inclusion 
of wax in the latex formulation is commonly employed and 
is well known in the art. Wax, it has been found, 
functions well as a component of a vinyl latex to provide 
key properties in the coating produced therefrom. As 
will be described in more detail hereinafter, a wide 
variety of waxes can be and have been included in vinyl 
latex. These waxes, generally added in low 
concentrations to the vinyl latex, provide coatings with 
improved mar resistance, anti-blocking properties, slip 
and formability improvement, anti-settling, coating 
flatting, abrasion resistance and metal marking 
resistance. As practiced in the art heretofore, waxes

A process for the production of a stable, 
paraffin wax-rich vinyl latex useful in the production of 

coatings having low moisture permeability comprising the 
steps of: 


a) copolymerizing in an organic solvent under 
addition copolymerization conditions for a time 

sufficient to produce a paraffin wax-rich water soluble resin a 
component mixture comprising: (1)10-30wt% of a paraffinic wax and 

(2) a monomer mixture of at least three vinyl monomers 
having a combined acid number between 150 and 250 and 

selected from vinyl monomers capable of providing 
homopolymers that exhibit glass transition temperatures 

greater than 70°C, and a free radical initiator; 
b) distilling the copolymerization reaction mixture 
to recover said water soluble resin; 
c) treating the water soluble resin with aqueous alkali in 
an amount sufficient to provide an aqueous paraffin wax-rich 

soluble resin having a pH between 7.5 and 9.5; 
d) introducing a portion of said aqueous soluble 
resin into an aqueous emulsion copolymerization component 

mixture under emulsion copolymerization conditions, said 
mixture comprising at least two vinyl monomers, one of 

which monomer comprises stearyl methacrylate, a nonionic 
surfactant, and a free radical aqueous emulsion 

polymerization initiator; whereby said stable, paraffin 
wax-rich vinyl latex is produced.

monomers are selected from 

acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, styrene, vinyltoluene, 
α-methylstyrene, vinyl chloride, acrylonitrile, 

acrylamide, vinyl acetate and esters of acrylic acid and

terpolymer of acrylic acid, styrene and isobutyl 
methacrylate.

wt.% said vinyl monomers; and the step d) component 
mixture contains 45-75 wt.% of said vinyl monomers, based 

on total solids.
