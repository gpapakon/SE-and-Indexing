<ABSTRACT>
A texturing machine comprising a main support framework (10) 
defining a creel (12) for supporting feed reels of the yarn (14) to be 

processed and a support structure (16) for collection assemblies (18) 
for the textured yarn, wherein said creel (12) and said structure (18) for 

supporting the yarn collection assemblies are opposite to and 
distanced one from the other to define an intermediate transit corridor 

(20), said texturing machine also comprising yarn texturing means (22) 
supported by said framework (16) and arranged alongside said creel 

(12) on its side facing the structure (16) for supporting the collection

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a textile machine for the texturing of
yarn by twisting thermoplastic deformation.With this machine the yarn to be processed, consisting of so many
parallel filaments, is deformed plastically so that the latter tangle and
join one to the other.To summarise, the texturing operation consists of heating the yarn
filaments to soften them slightly and of subjecting them, in this "pasty"
state, to twisting followed immediately by counter-twisting so as to
cause permanent plastic deformation of the yarn filaments to allow
tangling and binding of the filaments one with the other. This double
operation of twisting and untwisting performed on the yarn is defined by
those skilled in the art as "false twisting".The known texturing machines of the type referred above are generally
divided into a first type of machine having one single yarn heating oven
for true and proper texturing, i.e. for subjecting said yarn to the
abovementioned false twisting, intended to texture for example a
material such as nylon, and machines of a second type, intended to 
texture for example a material such as polyester, which in addition to
the first texturing oven have a second oven for stabilising the elastic
properties of the yarn, that is to say for heating the yarn in order to
eliminate its excessive elastic tensile deformability.The machines of the first type essentially comprise a main support
framework which defines a creel for supporting feed reels of the yarn to
be processed and a support structure for the collection assemblies of
the textured yarn, wherein the creel and the support structure of the
yarn collection assemblies are arranged and distanced one from the
other so as to define an intermediate transit corridor for staff in charge.The texturing machine also comprises yarn texturing means which
comprise essentially, in sequence: a part for drawing the yarn to be
textured coming from the the creel area, said texturing oven for heating
the yarn to be textured, a channel for cooling the heated yarn which
emerges from said texturing oven, a texturing spindle - that is to say a
device suitable for causing the required twisting and untwisting of the
yarn, and a part for drawing the textured yarn.A machine of that first type is disclosed in EP-A-0281657 and comprises a part for drawing the yarn delivered from creel area, a heater and a texturing spindle sequentially disposed in the avancing direction of the yarn substantially on a straight line.In known texturing machines the arrangement of the

an angle not greater than 15Â° and being arranged alongside said creel

(12), on the side of the latter facing the structure (16) for supporting the
collection assembly (18), and wherein are provided, in series with said

texturing means (22), stabilisation means (33) comprising at least a
second oven (34) for heating the yarn and a part (36) for drawing the

yarn coming out of said stabilisation oven (34), characterized in that
said stabilisation oven (34) is arranged above said transit corridor (20),

drawing the yarn to be textured is attached to a lower area of said creel

(12) and wherein the yarn to be textured is fed to said texturing means
(22) from below said creel (12), characterized in that a channel (38) for

the transport of the yarn is provided from the area of the creel (12) to
said texturing means (22), attached to said creel (12) and having at

least one branch (40) which develops below said creel (12).
A texturing machine according to claim 1, characterized in that said
part (36) for drawing the stabilised yarn is arranged at the side of said
