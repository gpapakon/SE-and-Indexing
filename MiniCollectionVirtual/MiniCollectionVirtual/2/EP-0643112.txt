<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel curable composition, a 
thermal latent acid catalyst, a method of coating, a coated article, 
a method of molding and a molded article. More particularly, it 
relates to a novel curable composition which is particularly excellent 
in storage stability and gives cured products having excellent 
chemical properties, physical properties, weathering resistance and 
stain resistance, which is able to be utilized in the field of coatings, 
ink, adhesive and molded plastics, a thermal latent catalyst capable 
to be utilized in the thermosetting composition, and a method of 
coating to provide a top coat having the above cured film properties 
and the excellent appearance by using the curable composition as 
the top coat material and the obtained coated article. It also relates 
to a method of molding to provide a molded article having the 
excellent mechanical properties, insulating characteristics, moisture 
resistance, corrosion resistance and cracking resistance by using the 
curable composition as the molding material and the obtained 
molded article. It is generally known that thermosetting compositions can be 
prepared from compounds having carboxyl groups and compounds 
having reactive functional groups which can form chemical bonds 
with the carboxyl groups by heating, such as epoxy group,  
 
oxazoline group, silanol group, alkoxysilane group, hydroxyl group, 
amino group, imino group, isocyanate group, blocked isocyanate 
group, cyclocarbonate group, vinyl ether group, vinyl thioether 
group, aminomethylol group, alkylated aminomethylol group, acetal 
group and ketal group. The thermosetting compositions give cured 
products having excellent chemical properties, physical properties and 
weathering resistance and are widely utilized in the field of coating 
composition, ink, adhesive and molded plastics. As the thermosetting compositions described above, for example, 
compositions comprising combinations of carboxyl group and epoxy 
group have been disclosed in Laid Open Japanese Patent Application 
Showa 51-114429, Laid Open European Patent Application 29595 
and United States Patents 4371667, 4650718, 4681811, 4703101 and 
4764430. However, the reactivity between the carboxyl group and the 
reactive functional groups is generally very high so that 
compositions in which compounds having carboxyl groups and 
compounds having the reactive functional groups are mixed together 
have a problem that the compositions are often gelled during storage 
and period
