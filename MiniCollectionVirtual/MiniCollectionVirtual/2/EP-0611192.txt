<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for obtaining compositions based on mixed oxides of zirconium and cerium which have high specific surfaces and are thermally stable, the said process being characterised in that it comprises the following stages: (i) a zirconium sol, on the one hand, and a cerium sol, on the other hand, are mixed in the stoichiometric proportions corresponding to those of the desired final composition, the ratio r of the mean diameter r1 of the particles constituting the zirconium sol to the diameter r2 of the particles constituting the cerium sol being at least 5, (ii) the mixture thus obtained is then dried by atomisation and finally (iv) the dried product is calcined. The invention also relates to the use of the compositions thus obtained as, or for the manufacture of, catalysts and/or catalyst supports, in particular in the field of automobile afterburning.

Process for the preparation of a composition
based on mixed zirconium and cerium oxides, characterized

in that it comprises the following stages:

(i) a zirconium sol, on the one hand, and a
cerium sol, on the other hand, are mixed in

stoichiometric proportions corresponding to those of the
final desired composition, the ratio r of the mean

diameter r

 of the particles constituting the said
zirconium sol to the diameter r
2
 of the particles constituting
the said cerium sol being at least 5,
(ii) the mixture thus obtained is then spray
dried,
