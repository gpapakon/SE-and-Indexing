<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of vibration 
isolators, and more particularly to apparatus for reducing 
structureborne noise due to vibrations induced on a platform 
by a moving mass mounted thereon. A ring laser gyroscope (RLG) utilizes two 
monochromatic laser beams propagating in opposite directions 
about a closed loop. Rotation of the apparatus about the 
loop axis effectively increases the beam path length in one 
direction and decreases the beam path in the opposite 
direction. Since the laser frequencies of the two counter-rotating 
beams are functions of the lasing path length, the 
differential path length established by the rotation of the 
RLG causes a frequency difference between the two beams. The 
magnitude and sign of this frequency difference are 
representative of the RLG's rate and direction of rotation 
and may be monitored for these purposes in manners well known 
in the art. At low rotation rates, the frequency difference 
between the counter-rotating beams is small and the beams 
tend to resonate at the same frequency, i.e. lock-in, and the 
RLG appears to be stationary. This lock-in prevents the RLG 
from sensing rotation rates that are at or below the lock-in 
rate. To reduce the lock-in rate, the RLG is mechanically 
oscillated, dithered, about the its axis to establish 
rotation in one direction and then the other. Such dithering 
provides a signal at the output terminals that is 
substantially independent of the mechanical oscillation while 
maintaining an apparent rotation in each direction, thus 
reducing the lock-in rotation rate.  
 The dithering causes the structure on which the RLG is mounted to 
vibrate, thereby generating structure-borne noise which adversely effects 
equipment mechanically coupled to the mounting structure. One method 
of the prior art for reducing structure-borne noise is disclosed in U.S. 
Patent 5,012,174 issued to Charles M Adkins, et al and assigned to the 
assignee of the present invention. Adkins, et al teach a device which is 
attached directly to the RLG platform and electronically establishes 
counter vibrations of the platform to cancel vibrations induced by the 
dithering RLG. The apparatus taught by Adkins, et al, however, is 
complex mechanically and electrically and is too expensive for use with 
the relatively inexpensive RLG. Other methods of the prior art for reducing structure-borne noise are 
disclosed in EP-A-0,100,785 reflecting the preamble of claim 1 and GB-A-965,134 reflecting the preamble of claim 3. The apparatus of
