<ABSTRACT>
Friction transmission with conical members, comprising friction cones revolving on parallel shafts and pointing in opposite directions, and a transmission member which couples the friction cones frictionally, at least two friction cones (3,4 and 5,6) which point in the same direction being arranged on each shaft (1,2), the transmission member (10) comprising a rigid cylindrical cage body (7) which surrounds the friction cones (3,4,5,6) and, for each of the friction cones (3,5 and 4,6) arranged one behind the other, has a friction ring (8 and 9 respectively) which is connected to it and the inner circumferential surface of which is split axially, each of the partial circumferential surfaces (11,12) enclosing with the axis of the cage body (7) angles of taper ( beta 1,  beta 2) which correspond to the angles of taper ( beta '1 and  beta '2 respectively) of the associated friction cones (3,4 and 5,6 respectively) with their axes of rotation, the transmission member (10) furthermore being connected to an axially acting adjusting device (13,14), and a contact-pressure device which acts axially on at least one shaft (1,2) and is supported on the housing being provided.
