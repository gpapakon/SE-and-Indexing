<ABSTRACT>
A submersible pump for pumping radioactive liquids comprises a pump cartridge (2) which is removably mounted in a cavity (3) formed in the pump body (1). Seals (30a, 30b) are provided between the cartridge (2) and the cavity (3). The cartridge houses a pneumatically operated motor to drive an impeller which discharges liquid through an outlet duct (10). Compressed air required for driving the motor is supplied through an air inlet tube (12) and air exhausted from the motor is conveyed through an air outlet tube (14). Both the air inlet and the air outlet tubes extend through the interior of the outlet duct (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a submersible pump for 
pumping liquids, particularly radioactive liquids, from a 
tank or similar vessel. In the nuclear industry, particularly in nuclear fuel 
reprocessing operations, there are a number of processes in 
which radioactive liquids require to be transferred by 
means of a pump. One such process is the decanning of 
spent nuclear fuel elements. This process involves 
transporting the spent fuel elements in water-filled skips 
from a storage pond into a shielded decanning cave where 
the cladding is mechanically stripped from the fuel 
elements. Water, which is radioactively contaminated by 
the spent fuel elements, is then removed from the skips by 
pumps. Operations within the decanning cave are controlled 
from outside the cave so as to protect the operators from 
exposure to radiation. It is important therefore that the 
pumps can be serviced or maintained in the cave by the use 
of remotely controlled manipulators installed in the cave. 
When a pump becomes inoperative or malfunctions it is 
desirable that repairs are carried out quickly and, in 
particular, that replacement of defective components can be 
achieved by use of a manipulator. Another desirable feature is that the pump should be 
as compact as possible so that when it is scrapped the 
volume of radioactive waste for disposal is kept to a 
minimum. In FR-A-2 361 558 a centrifugal pump is described which 
is designed for pumping hazardous liquids, for example, 
radioactive liquids. The pump comprises a body having an 
upwardly directed opening defined by an outwardly flared 
wall. Removably mounted within the body is a pump 
cartridge which is seated on the flared wall by means of 
seals. A liquid inlet provided in the body communicates 
with a liquid inlet in the cartridge and a liquid outlet  
 
provided in the body. A rotor housed within the cartridge 
is drivingly connected to an electric motor located outside 
the cartridge. Pumps of this type are unsuitable for use 
as submersible units because of the problems associated 
with ensuring efficient isolation of the electrical power 
supply and the motor from the liquid. A submersible type of pump is described in 
US-A-4403923 for moving liquids such as waste liquids and 
sewage. The pump comprises a motor housing containing a 
motor to which an impeller is drivingly connected. The 
housing can be releasably attached by means of a bayonet-type 
fitting to a volute fixedly mounted on the floor of 
the pit from which the liquid is to be pumped. In
