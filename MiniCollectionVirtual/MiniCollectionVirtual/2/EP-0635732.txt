<ABSTRACT>
A seismic alarm device for vehicles which is capable of 
detecting an earthquake while the vehicle is moving and 

gives the alarm upon occurrence of the earthquake in 
order to provide the safety such as by stopping the 

motor vehicle, wherein a plurality of acceleration 
detectors (4) are mounted on the front and rear of the 

vehicle or on the left and right sides of the vehicle, 
output signals generated from these acceleration detectors 

are fed to a determination circuit (2), which determination 
circuit is arranged to measure an amplitude and 

period of the output signals and to compare phases of 
the output signals, then to output an alarm signal if 

the amplitude of the output signals is larger than a 
predetermined value while their periods are within a 

predetermined range and no phase difference exists 
between the output signals of the acceleration detectors (4), 

and an alarm circuit (3) gives the alarm when the 
determination circuit outputs the alarm signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a seismic alarm 
device for vehicles in which an alarm signal is generated 
when an earthquake is detected based on output 
signals from acceleration detector elements which are 
mounted at various points on a vehicle. Conventionally, a device for detecting an earthquake 
and generating an alarm signal has been employed in 
various fields. For example, there is a device in which 
an acceleration detector element employing a pendulum or 
consisting of a piezoelectric element or strain gage is 
mounted on a stationary object, and an alarm signal is 
generated when such element vibrates at a value higher 
than a predetermined vibration value or outputs a signal 
which exceeds a predetermined value. However, all such are mounted on a stationary object, 
and there has been no example where they are 
mounted on a moving object such as a vehicle which is 
subject to various types of pitching according to conditions 
of the road surface on which it is moving. There have been considerable vehicle accidents 
causing from damages of roads due to a huge earthquake.  
 
If a device were able to generate an alarm signal as 
soon as an earthquake occurs, such vehicle accidents 
could have been prevented from causing by stopping the 
vehicle with a seismic alarm device. It is therefore an object of this invention to 
provide a vehicle-mounted seismic alarm device for 
vehicles being capable of detecting a difference between 
the jolts of the vehicle caused by an earthquake and 
those by vehicle movement, and generating an alarm 
signal in case of the earthquake. A seismic alarm device for vehicles according to the 
this invention comprises a plurality of acceleration 
detector elements mounted at various points on a vehicle; 
a determination means for outputting an alarm 
signal by receiving output signals from these acceleration 
detector elements when it is detected that, wherein 
measuring an amplitude and period of each output signal, 
comparing phases of output signals generated from the 
acceleration detector elements mounted on the front and 
rear of the vehicle or on the left and right sides of 
the vehicle, and when the amplitude of the output signal 
is detected larger than a predetermined value while the 
period is within a predetermined range and no phase 
difference exists between output signals from the acceleration 
detector elements mounted on the front and rear 
sides or on the left and right sides; and an alarm means  
 
which receives an output of the determination
