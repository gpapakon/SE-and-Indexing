<ABSTRACT>
Radiation-cured pressure-sensitive adhesives are provided comprising a 
radiation cured polyurethane backbone capped with both an acrylic or methacrylic 

reactive terminating group and residues of a mono-ol or polyol non-reactive 
terminating group. The adhesives include a functional amount of a thio compound 

which provides for improved control in pressure-sensitive adhesive properties 
when the adhesive precursor is irradiated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to radiation curable compositions useful as
pressure sensitive adhesives. The compositions are based on low molecular weight
polyurethane oligomers containing both an acrylic or methacrylic reactive
terminating group and residues of a mono-ol or polyol non-reactive terminating
group. On exposure to radiation the curable compositions are converted into
pressure-sensitive adhesives characterized by a desirable balance of aggressive
tack and high-temperature hold.Radiation curable compositions which are curable to function as pressure-sensitive
adhesives are known in the prior art. For example, liquid oligomer
compositions (providing solventless coatings) containing unsaturated end groups
can be coated on a substrate and cured rapidly by radiation such as electron beam
or ultraviolet light radiation to form adhesive layers. In US-A-4,022,926
a method is disclosed for
making adhesive labels in which the adhesive and base layers are formed by
radiation curing. The curable compositions for both layers according to that
patent preferably comprise a polyurethane capped with residues of a hydroxyalkyl
acrylate or methacrylate ester. The curable composition for the adhesive layer
therein is prepared preferably by adding tackifying resins or agents to the
curable compositions used for the base layer in order to obtain the needed
adhesive properties.In US-A-5,087,686
radiation curable compositions for providing pressure-sensitive adhesives are
described which comprise a polyurethane capped with residues of hydroxyalkyl
acrylate or methacrylate which do not require the addition of tackifying resins
or agents to obtain the needed adhesive properties in the cured composition. The
improvements therein are based on formulating compositions to contain monoalcohol
residues which are saturated or contain unsaturated groups which do not
polymerize with the acrylate or methacrylate residues when subjected to
radiation. The non-polymerizable residues as used in that patent are residues
which do not polymerize with isocyanate or unsaturated groups. Known radiation curable pressure-sensitive adhesives available commercially
will ordinarily favor tack, an important property in pressure-sensitive
adhesives, at the expense of high temperature holding power. The invention
described in the '686 patent lacks a commercially desirable
balance of tack and high temperature holding power. Improved tack in typical
pressure-sensitive adhesive formulations is obtained at the expense of poorer
high temperature
