<ABSTRACT>
A clock pulse generator has a three-state inverter 
(13) and a transfer gate (14) forming in combination a 

feedback loop for oscillating an output clock signal in 
cooperation with a quartz oscillator (17) in an internal 

oscillation mode, and the three-state inverter (13) enters 
into high-impedance state in an external oscillation mode 

so that an external clock signal (CLKex) is transferred to 
the output node (N13) of the three-state inverter without 

malfunction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a clock pulse generator 
and, more particularly, to a low power-consumption clock 
pulse generator for producing a clock signal from one of 
the internal and external clock sources. A typical example of the clock pulse generator similar to EP-A 0 398 331 is 
illustrated in figure 1 of the drawings, and largely 
comprises a quartz oscillator coupled between nodes N1 and 
N2, an inverter 2 coupled between a positive power voltage 
line Vdd and a ground voltage line GND and responsive to 
the potential level at the node N1 for producing the 
inverted potential level at the node N2, a transfer gate 3 
coupled between the nodes N1 and N2, an n-channel 
enhancement type discharging transistor Qn1 coupled between 
the node N1 and the ground voltage line GND, a controller 4 
responsive to a control signal CTL1 for controlling the 
transfer gate 3 and an output inverter 5 coupled to the 
node N2 for producing an output clock signal OUT1. Two 
control signals CTL1 and CTL2 are supplied to the 
controller 4, and the control signal CTL2 is further  
 
supplied to the n-channel enhancement type discharging 
transistor Qn1. The control signal CTL1 is indicative of 
selection between the quartz oscillator 1 and an external 
clock signal CLKe, and the other control signal CTL2 
forcibly disable the prior art clock pulse generator. 
Though not shown in figure 1, the control signal CTL1 is 
supplied from an external controlling circuit such as a 
microprocessor. A series combination of p-channel enhancement type 
switching transistor Qp2 and an n-channel enhancement type 
switching transistor Qn3 serves as the inverter 2, and the 
potential level at the node N1 causes the p-channel 
enhancement type switching transistor Qp2 and the n-channel 
enhancement type switching transistor Qn3 to 
complementarily turn on and off. The transfer gate 3 is implemented by a parallel 
combination of a p-channel enhancement type transfer 
transistor Qp4 and an n-channel enhancement type transfer 
transistor Qn5, and a gate control signal TG1 and the 
complementary gate control signal CTG1 cause the p-channel 
enhancement type transfer transistor Qp4 and the n-channel 
enhancement type transfer transistor Qn5 to concurrently 
turn on for coupling the output node of the inverter 2 to  
 
the input node thereof. The n-channel enhancement type discharging transistor 
Qn1 is coupled between the node N1 and the ground voltage 
line GND, and the control signal CTL2 is supplied to the 
gate electrode of the n-channel
