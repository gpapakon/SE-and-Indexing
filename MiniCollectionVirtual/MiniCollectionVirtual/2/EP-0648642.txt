<ABSTRACT>
A rear signalling light for motor vehicles characterised in that it comprises a single casing (110, 120) comprising a part (110) for mounting on an element (L) of the vehicle, the inclination of which varies from one vehicle to another, a light source (230) and an element (210) mounted so as to pivot adjustably in the casing about an axis (A), and a part of which defines a cover lens (212) for processing the light produced by the source, and in that the lamp (230) is mounted on the said pivoting element (210) in a space defined jointly by the latter and by the said single casing, adjustment of the pivoting element making it possible to compensate for inclination variations of the said element (L) of the vehicle and to emit a beam with fixed overall direction. Application in particular to universal centre-high (raised) braking lights for rear lights with variable inclinations.

Rear indicator light for a motor vehicle, of the type
comprising a housing (110, 120) comprising a part (110) for

mounting on an element (L) of the vehicle whose inclination
varies from one vehicle to another, a pivoting assembly (210)

articulated in the housing so as to be adjustable about an
axis (A), comprising a lamp (230) and a glass (212) for

processing the light produced by the lamp, the adjustment of
the pivoting assembly making it possible to compensate for

variations in inclination of the said element (L) of the
vehicle and to emit a beam with an imposed general direction,

characterised in that the pivoting assembly has no housing and
in that the lamp (230) is mounted in a space defined

conjointly by the said pivoting assembly and the said housing.
Indicator light according to Claim 1, characterised in
that it also comprises a flux recuperation mirror (130) and in

that the mirror (130) is mounted fixed on the said housing
(120).
Indicator light according to Claim 2, characterised in
that the mirror (130) has a centre of curvature situated on

the said axis (a).
Indicator light according to Claim 1, 2 or 3,
characterised in that the said pivoting element (210) is

mounted so as to be continuously adjustable in the housing.
Indicator light according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the element of the vehicle consists of

the rear window (L) of the latter and in that the said axis
(A) is horizontal.
Indicator light according to Claim 5, characterised in
that the lamp (230) is mounted so as to be aligned and centred

on the said axis (A). 
Indicator light according to Claim 6, characterised in
that the housing comprises a first part (110) forming a visor,

constituting the said part for mounting on the rear window
(L), and a second part (120) receiving a lamp (230) and the

pivoting element (210), in that a partition (114) is provided
between the two parts and has an opening (114a), and in that

the said pivoting element (210) is mounted in line with the
said opening and engaged partially therein at the level of the

glass (212).
Indicator light according to Claim 7, characterised in
that the pivoting element (210) is mounted on the said first

part (110) of the housing and has two lateral members (218) of
circular profile in which two vertical slots (218a) are

respectively formed, the said first part (110) of the housing
having arrangements (119) for screwing cap screws (140)

passing through the said slots, in order thus to achieve
selectively the locking of the said members between the

respective screw heads and the said arrangements in the
desired angular position.
Indicator light according to Claim 8, characterised in
that the said members in the shape of arcs of a circle (218)

are centred on the said axis (A).
Indicator light according to one of Claims 7 to 9,
characterised in that the said glass (212) is provided between

two arched parts (212a, 212b) of the pivoting element (210),
centred on the said axis and extending horizontally close to

top and bottom rectilinear edges of the said opening (114a) in
the partition (114).
