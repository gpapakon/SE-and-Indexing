<ABSTRACT>
A mill including large-diameter work rolls (12,13) 
which are directly driven is disposed in an upstream 

stage of a hot strip finish rolling mill train (23), and 
mills including small-diameter work rolls (14,15,16) which are 

driven by back-up rolls or intermediate rolls are 
disposed in middle and downstream stages of the hot 

strip finish rolling mill train (23), so that a strip can be 
rolled with strong draft and at a low speed, whereby a 

small-scale production of hot strips on the order of 
million tons annual yield can be achieved with a compact 

structure of equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rolling method by which small-scale production of hot strips can be realized with a compact structure of equipmentAs described in "Recent Hot Strip Manufacture Techniques in Japan". (published by Japan Steel Association, August 10, 1987), p. 176 and pp. 6-10, for example, a typical hot steel plate rolling mill system (hereinafter referred to as "hot strip mill") is large-scaled such that a slab of 200 t is rolled by one or a plurality of rough rolling mills into a bar with a thickness of 20 to 40 mm, which bar is then rolled by tandem finish rolling mills comprised of 6 to 7 stands. Such a hot strip mill provides a yield of 3 to 4 million tons/year and is adapted for mass production. A 4-high mill of work roll driving type is employed as each of the rough rolling mills, and a 4-high or 6-high mill of work roll driving type is employed as each of the finish rolling mills.Although a steel plate (hereinafter referred to as a "slab") fed to the rough rolling mill is generally of about 200 mm thick there also is seen a slab of about 50 mm thick due to recent development of a thin slab continuous casting method. In the latter case; rough rolling mills become unnecessary and the hot strip mill is constituted solely by a group of finish rolling mills.On the other hand, known as being of small-scale production type is the so-called Steckel mill comprising one reversible rough mill and a reversible mill provided with furnace coilers upstream and downstream thereof, as described, for example, in "Hitachi Review Vol. 70, No. 6", (June 25, 1988), pp. 67-72. The Steckel mill accompanies a disadvantage that holding the strip temperature and removing surface scale are difficult to achieve at the same time, but it has been widely used for rolling those strips such as stainless steel plates which are less likely to produce scale.When the Steckel mill is applied to plain steel strip or the like, strip surface scale produced in the coiler furnaces must be removed by descaling jet water, which results in a problem of lowering the strip temperature.Since product quality has to be sacrificed as mentioned above, applications of products are limited and examples of their use are small in all the wide world.The current typical hot strip mill is of mass production type providing a yield of 3 to 6 million tons per year. Hitherto, there has naturally existed a demand for reducing the production scale and also reducing the equipment size correspondingly. Recent generation of iron scraps in a great

<CLAIMS>
Hot rolling method using a mini hot rolling mill system in which a hot slab is rolled in at least one rough rolling mill (3 to 6) and afterwards in a finish rolling mill train (23) including three four- or six-high rolling mills (14 to 16) each having work rolls (35, 36; 43, 44; 60, 61; 64, 65; 70, 71; 74, 75; 80, 81) of a small diameter of not more than 450 mm,
characterized by
 the steps of

- thinning the leading end portion of the rough-rolled hot slab (88) by a rolling mill (14) disposed in the upstream stage of the finish rolling mill train (23),
- driving said small-diameter work rolls (35, 36; 43, 44; 60, 61; 64, 65; 70, 71; 74, 75; 80, 81) of the four- or six-high rolling mills (14 to 16) indirectly through their associated back-up rolls (33, 34; 47, 48; 62, 63; 68, 69; 72, 73; 78, 79; 82 to 85) or intermediate rolls (45, 46; 66, 67) and
- rolling the thinned hot slab (88) by the finish rolling mills (14 to 16) of the small-diameter work rolls with a strong draft and a low speed,
- wherein the step of thinning the leading end portion of the hot slab (88) by said mill (14) disposed in the upstream stage of the finish mill train (23) comprises opening the roll gap of said mill (14) to such an extent as to be larger than the thickness of the hot slab (88), passing the slab through roll biting portions, stopping the slab (88) at a position before the slab (88) is bitten into the subsequent mill (15) and withdrawing the slab to the entry side of the finish rolling mill train (23), while the roll gap is closed or a certain amount of draft is applied, thereby thinning the leading end portion of the slab (88).
Rolling method according to claim 1,
characterized in that

when said hot slab (88) is withdrawn to the entry side of the finish rolling mill train (23) an offset of the work rolls (36, 38) of the upstream finish rolling mill (14) is changed over to the entry side.
