<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an assembly type disk 
storage board and an assembly type disk storage apparatus 
which is provided a plural of disk storage drives to a sheet 
of support plate. Recently, an assembly type disk storage apparatus, 
which is mounted a plural of disk drives, for example, a 
magnetic disk drive, an optical disk drive, an optical 
magnetic disk drive and the like, is high-lighted. This 
assembly type disk storage apparatus is used as an array 
disk apparatus for performing recording and reproducing 
which is operated the plural disk storage apparatuses in 
parallel. Further, the apparatus is used as a disk 
apparatus for improving more higher reliability by making 
the system in duplicate. More particularly, the array disk apparatus presents an 
ever-increasing demand, as it becomes possible to make a 
processing of the computer system at high-speed. Such 
assembly type disk apparatus is required to reduce the size  
 
of the apparatus, have high effectiveness and reduce the 
cost. Fig. 1 is an explanatory diagram of a prior art and 
Fig. 2 is a structural diagram of the conventional disk 
drive. As shown in Fig. 1, a sub flame 18 is mounted to each 
of magnetic disk apparatuses with screws. And the array 
disk apparatus is constituted by mounting these apparatuses 
into a system locker 19. This magnetic disk apparatus 17 has a disk drive 20 
including a magnetic disk, a magnetic head and an actuator, 
as shown in Fig. 2. And this disk drive 20 is mounted to a 
mounting flame 23 via vibration proof rubbers 21. This mounting flame 23 supports the disk drive 20 via 
the vibration proof rubbers 21. This flame 23 has screw 
holes 22 for mounting the flame 23 to the sub flame 18. 
This vibration proof rubber 21 is to buffer the vibration 
of the inside and outside of the disk drive 20. Further, a 
control printed circuit board 24 which is mounted a 
controller for controlling the disk drive 20 and recording 
and reproducing information is provided on the disk drive 
20. In this way, the conventional array disk apparatus 
mounts the disk apparatus 20 to the mounting flame 23 via 
the vibration proof rubbers 21. The conventional apparatus 
is constituted so as that the sub flame 18 is mounted to the 
system locker 19 with screws, after mounting this apparatus 
to the sub flame 18.  However, in the prior art, it is required to take an 
space for mounting to the system locker 19, because each of 
magnetic disk apparatuses 17 are mounted to the system 
locker 19, respectively, thus
