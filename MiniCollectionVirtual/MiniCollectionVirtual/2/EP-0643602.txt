<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to novel composite fabrics having resistance to penetration by chemical agents, particularly organic chemical agents of a gaseous and/or liquid nature such as may be encountered in the chemical industry or in military situations where chemical warfare agents have been deployed. The fabrics of the invention have application in the manufacture of protective clothing for use in chemically contaminated environments or in the manufacture of other items for protecting humans and their equipment, eg. casualty evacuation bags or respirator bags. The fabrics comprise two shell layers provided above one or more anti-gas carbon containing fabric layers, at least one of the shell layers being oil-repellent with the both layers most preferably being of oil-repellent nature or the other being an organic liquid wicking layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOSITE FABRICS FOR PROTECTION AGAINST CHEMICAL AGENTS.The present invention relates to novel composite fabrics having resistance to penetration by chemical agents, particularly organic chemical agents of a gaseous and/or liquid nature such as may be encountered in the chemical industry or in military situations where chemical warfare agents have been deployed. The fabrics of the invention have preferred application in the manufacture of protective clothing for use in chemically contaminated environments or in the manufacture of other items for protecting humans and their equipment, eg. casualty evacuation bags or respirator bags.The protection a fabric affords the wearer against chemical agents in the surrounding environment is only one of the factors influencing its design and that of garments and containers made from it. It is also necef* Ty, inter alia, to consider the physiological load that will be impo. . on the user, the cost, and the inten ? conditions of its use. It is important that the protection afforded , maximised within the constraints imposed by other factors.One approach adopted in providing such protection is by use of fabrics comprised of air permeable materials which are water repellent but which permit the wicking of neat chemical agent drops. Wicking serves two purposes: a) it encourages evaporative loss of agent from the surr _ce of the cloth to the atmosphere by increasing the exposed surface area; b) it subjects ingressing vapour to a larger area of antigas fabric below the wicking layer thereby maximising absorptive uptake by the carbon contained therein.Other factors also play a part in the selection of the most appropriate outer material, such as repellency, durability, low flammability, low infrared emissivity, ability to take DP dyes etc.At the present time the introduction of new materials and textile technologies such as microporous materials (Eg Goretex RTM) and/or 

microfibres, textile laminates and coated fabrics, has provided a number of elaborate new approaches to the problems of provision of chemical agent protective fabrics.A central requirement for any new fabric is the retention of breathability to minimise physiological load, an important requirement despite the constraints this imposes upon types of material which can be used and their construction. An understanding of liquid behaviour, particularly at the first barrier (ie that of the shell fabric) is considered to be of importance in providing maximum protection, whether the system be of improved
