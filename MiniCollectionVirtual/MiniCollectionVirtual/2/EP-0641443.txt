<ABSTRACT>
An assay for activated factor VII (factor VIIa) has been developed using truncated tissue factor (TF), a soluble mutant form of TF that retains the cofactor function of TF toward factor VIIa. Unlike full-length TF, however, tTF appears not to support the conversion of factor VII to VIIa. As a result, the tTF assay for factor VIIa is free from interference from factor VII in the plasma and is therefore specific for factor VIIa. The assay is much simpler than existing assays, because it is a single-stage clotting assay performed almost identically to a PT assay. It is also considerably more sensitive than current assays for factor VIIa in plasma. Since the tTF assay is calibrated against a factor VIIa standard, it yields an absolute concentration of factor VIIa in ng/ml.

<DESCRIPTION>
The United States government has rights in this
invention by virtue of a grant from the National
Institutes of Health.Blood coagulation results from the production of
thrombin, a proteolytic enzyme inducing platelet
aggregation and cleaving fibrinogen to fibrin, which
stabilizes the platelet plug. A number of proenzymes
and procofactors circulating in the blood interact in
this process through several stages during which they
are sequentially or simultaneously converted to the
activated form, ultimately resulting in the activation
of prothrombin to thrombin by activated factor X (fXa)
in the presence of factor Va, ionic calcium, and
platelets.Factor X can be activated by either of two
pathways, termed the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.
The intrinsic pathway, or surface-mediated activation
pathway, consists of a series of reactions where a
protein precursor is cleaved to form an active
protease, beginning with activation of factor XII to
factor XIIa, which converts factor XI to factor XIa,
which, in the presence of calcium, converts factor IX
to factor IXa. Factor IX can also be activated via
the extrinsic pathway by tissue factor (TF) in
combination with activated factor VII (factor VIIa;
fVIIa). The activated factor IX, in the presence of
calcium, phospholipid (platelets), and factor VIIIa,
activates factor X to factor Xa.Physiologically, the major pathway involved in
coagulation is believed to be the extrinsic pathway,
an essential step of which is activation of factor VII
to factor VIIa. Clotting assays (and other activity
assays) designed to measure factor VII and VIIa
generally must employ TF, the cofactor required for
factor VIIa coagulant activity. Most commonly, TF is
provided as a relatively crude preparation known as 
thromboplastin. Tissue factor is an integral membrane
glycoprotein having a protein and a phospholipid
component. It has been isolated from a variety of
tissues and species and reported to have a molecular
mass of between 42,000 and 53,000. The original crude
tissue abstracts referred to the fraction containing
the tissue factor as thromboplastin. DNA encoding
tissue factor and methods for expression of the
protein have now been reported, for example, in
European Patent Application 0 278 776 by Genentech,
Inc. and by J. H. Morrissey, et al. Cell 50, 129-135
(1987).The complex of factor VIIa and TF is the most
potent known trigger of the clotting cascade. Factor
VII is present in plasma at a concentration of 0.5
µg/ml plasma. In contrast, measured as described
herein, factor

<CLAIMS>
A method for measuring the concentration of coagulation
Factor VIIa in a patient's plasma sample, comprising the steps

of:

(a) mixing a quantity of a plasma sample with a first
reagent, said first reagent comprising a soluble truncated

tissue factor characterized by its inability to bind to phospholipids
and its inability to support conversion of Factor VII to

Factor VIIa, to form a first mixture;
(b) adding a second reagent either simultaneously with said
first reagent or thereafter, said second reagent comprising an

effective amount of calcium ions to initiate clotting of said
first mixture;
(c) measuring a plasma clotting time of said first mixture
from a time of addition of said second reagent to a time of clot

formation; and
(d) comparing said plasma clotting time to a standards
clotting time determined for Factor VIIa of a known concentration

diluted in Factor VII - deficient plasma.
The method of Claim 1, wherein said first reagent or
said second reagent further comprises a phospholipid agent.
The method of Claim 1 or 2, wherein said plasma sample
is diluted between about 1:10 and 1:100 with Factor VII-deficient

plasma prior to step (a).
The method of Claims 1, 2, or 3, wherein the concentration
of said soluble truncated tissue factor in said first

mixture is from about 10 nanomolar to about 1 micromolar.
The method of Claims 1, 2, 3, or 4, wherein said standards
clotting time is determined for a known co
ncentration of
Factor VIIa diluted in Factor VII-deficient plasma by adding a

like quantity of said first reagent and said second reagent as
that added to said plasma sample to said known concentration of

Factor VIIa diluted in Factor VII-deficient plasma and measuring 
said standards clotting time from a time of addition of said

second reagent to a time of clotting, and correlating said known
concentration of Factor VIIa with said standards clotting time

to form a standard curve.
The method of Claims 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, wherein said
effective amount of calcium ions is a concentration of at least

3mM.
A kit for use in measuring Factor VIIa in a plasma
sample, comprising:


(a) a truncated tissue factor reagent comprising truncated
tissue factor solubilized in an aqueous medium, said truncated

tissue factor characterized by inability to bind to a phospholipid
membrane surface and inability to support conversion of

Factor VII to Factor VIIa, provided in a first container;
(b) a Factor VII-deficient plasma provided in a second
container; and
(c) a Factor VIIa standard provided in a third container.
The kit of Claim 7, further comprising:

(d) a fourth container containing a calcium ion source.
The kit of Claim 7 or 8, further comprising a phospholipid
agent either in a fifth container or added to one or more

of the other containers.
The kit of Claims 7-9, further comprising:

   a plurality of vials, each of said vials containing a
known concentration of Factor VIIa in a diluent comprising Factor

VII-deficient plasma, said plurality of vials providing a
range of known Factor VIIa concentration from about 1 picogram

per milliliter to about 10 microgram per milliliter.
