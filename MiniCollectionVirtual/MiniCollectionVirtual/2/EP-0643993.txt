<ABSTRACT>
Catalyst including silica and an acidic phase comprising sulphuric acid which impregnates the said silica, its preparation and its use in catalytic alkylation of isobutane and/or isopentane in the presence of at least one olefin containing from 3 to 6 carbon atoms per molecule, the said catalyst being characterised in that it consists essentially of particles with a mean diameter of between 0.1 and 30  mu m and in that the total pore volume of the silica, before its impregnation with the said acidic phase, is between 0.1 and 0.6 cm

<CLAIMS>
Catalyst containing silica and an acid phase consisting of sulphuric
acid, the silica having been impregnated with said acid phase and

said catalyst being such that it is essentially composed of particles
with an average diameter of between 0.1 and 30 µm, and in that

the silica, prior to its impregnation with said acid phase, has a total
porous volume of between 0.1 and 0.6 cm

 per gram.
Catalyst according to claim 1 such that the average diameter of the
particles of the catalyst is between 5 and 30 µm.
Catalyst according to one of claims 1 or 2 such that the content by
weight of acid phase of said catalyst is between 1 and 40%.

isopentane by at least one element selected from the group formed

by olefins containing 3 to 6 carbon atoms per molecule, in which
the reaction temperature is lower than 10°C.
Use according to claim 6 in which the catalyst is used in a perfect
