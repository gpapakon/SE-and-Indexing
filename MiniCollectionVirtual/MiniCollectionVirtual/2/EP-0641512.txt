<ABSTRACT>
A cutting head for a cord-type mower driven by an engine (3) 
is disclosed. The cutting head includes a rotor capable of 

rotating about an axis and a bobbin (8) with a cord wound on it. 
The bobbin can rotate relatively to the rotor about the axis (7a) in 

the rotor. The cutting head includes two types of cord (11) feeding 
systems. The first cord feeding system automatically feeds a 

cord in response to cord wear. The second cord feeding system 
feeds a cord in response to a manual tapping operation executed 

during driving of the cutting head. The second cord feeding 
system disconnects one of the bobbin and rotor from the engine 

in response to the tapping operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application claims the priority of Japanese Patent 
Application No. 2-312500 filed on November 16, 1990 which is 
incorporated herein by reference. The present invention relates generally to a cutting head 
for a cord type mower. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a cord feeding system for extending a cord wound on 
a bobbin in a rotary casing to a length necessary for mowing. Many conventional cord type mowers have systems in their 
cutting heads for feeding new cord when the current cord length 
is insufficient. Also, manual-type cutting heads are known 
which permit manual extension of the cord wound on a bobbin. At present, the so called tap-and-go type and automatic 
type cutting heads are popular. For the tap-and-go type, the 
cord is fed the required length by releasing an interlock 
between a bobbin and a rotary casing. The interlock is released 
either by hitting or strongly pressing the rotary casing 
against the ground. This type of cutting head is disclosed in, 
for example, Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 2-16595, 
Japanese Patent Publication No. 2-26922, US Patent No. 4161820, 
US Patent No. 4183138, and US Patent No. 4189833. For the automatic type, the interlock between the bobbin 
and rotary casing is released by the centrifugal force which 
changes according to the length of the cord that extends from 
the rotary casing. Thus, the desired cord length can be 
maintained. This type of cutting head is disclosed in, for 
example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 59-22484, Japanese 
Patent Laid-open No. 60-83508, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 
63-79522, Japanese Patent Laid-open No, 2-163003, US Patent No. 
4347666, US Patent No. 4607431, US Patent No. 4660286, and us 
Patent No. 4817288. For the tap-and-go type, it is necessary for the operator  
 
to frequently check the length of the cord consumed during 
mowing and extend the cord by hitting the rotary casing against 
the ground at times or strongly pressing it. Otherwise, the 
mowing efficiency greatly decreases. Therefore, the operator 
always has to execute checking and hitting. The checking and 
hitting give a large mental burden and physical load to the 
operator. However, the tap-and-go type has the advantage that the 
operator can freely set the cord length according to the state 
of the material (such as grass) being cut. For example, when 
grass is soft, it is possible to improve the operation 
efficiency by extending the cord length which permits to the 
cutter to mow at a faster rate. When grass

A cutting head for a cord-type mower having a motor 
or engine (3) for driving the cutting head, comprising: 

   a casing (4) driven by the motor (3) to rotate about an 
axis (7a); 

   a bobbin (8) mounted in said casing (4) and adapted to 
rotate around said axis (7a) relative to said casing (4); 

   a cord (11) wound about said bobbin (8); and 
   a cord feed slot (10) provided on the outer periphery of 

said casing (4), for permitting the distal end of said cord 
(11) to extend outside said casing (4) to a suitable cutting 

position, said cutting head being characterised by further 
comprising: 

   a drive link holder (65) mounted in said casing (4) and 
being capable of rotating relative to said casing 94) around 

said axis (7a), for supporting at least one drive link (12) 
such that said drive link (12) is capable to reciprocate 

relative to said axis; 
   a boss (61) for coupling said bobbin (8) to said drive 

link holder (65), said boss (61) being capable of sliding along 
said axis relative to said bobbin (8), and along said axis 

relative to said drive link holder (65), said boss (61) 
rotating about said axis together with said bobbin (8) and said 

drive link holder (65), and said boss (61) having a tapered 
guide surface (61b) at its top end, and a bottom portion which 

projects from said casing (4) and which should be pressed at 
the time of tapping operation; 

   said drive link (12) being movable between a transmitting 
position for transmitting the rotation of said casing (4) to 

said bobbin (8) via said drive link holder (65) and said boss 
(61), and n idling position for allowing said bobbin (8), said 

boss (61) and said drive link holder (65) to slip relative to 
said casing (4) without transmitting the rotation of said 

casing (4) to said bobbin (8);

link (12) toward said transmitting position from said idling 
position; 

   said boss (61) being capable of reciprocating between a

returns to the first position from the second position, when 
said bottom portion is free from the pressing, whereby the 

cutting head has an automatic cord feed mode in which said
