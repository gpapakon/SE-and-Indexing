<ABSTRACT>
The material is made to advance inside a rotor 
(3) into which liquid nitrogen is sprayed to cool the 

material until it becomes brittle; a bar (28) inside the 
rotor and a mill (36) are used as means of crushing, 

followed by means of classified separation (42; 50; 54) 
of components of the said waste.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an installation for 
cryogenic destruction, cryogenic transformation, and 
sorting or classifying of solid municipal waste. European 
patent application 92830174.6 (0 511 176) describes an 
installation of the type mentioned above, comprising a 
rotor in which the material - which may have been dried, 
treated to remove ferromagnetic metal, and cooled - is 
made to advance, and into which liquid nitrogen is 
sprayed to cool the material until it becomes brittle; 
this installation also comprises means of crushing and 
means of classified separation of components of the said 
waste. The invention concerns an installation which has 
been improved for an increase in throughput, for a 
reduction in the energy requirements of its operation, 
for the recovery of waste in sorted form and for other 
objects which will be understood from the following text. According to the invention, at least one impact 
body which acts in an area in which the material is 
already brittle as a result of cooling, is provided in 
the rotor; internal appendages capable of raising, during 
the rotation of the rotor, any parts of the material, and 
also the said body, and letting it fall back on the 
material, are provided in the rotor. A mill for crushing 
the material which has been made brittle is provided 
after the rotor; this is followed by a series of 
separators to separate fractions of increasing lightness; 
a closed circuit of treated fluid is made to flow through 
the separators for transport and to prevent the aggregation 
of the materials. An impact body shaped so that it can roll may be 
provided in the rotor. An impact body of this type in the 
rotor may consist of a bar with flange projections for 
concentrated action on the material on which the said bar 
falls after being raised by the rotor.  At the discharge end, the rotor may have a cap 
with a movable bulkhead which can uncover in a 
controllable way the aperture for discharge from the 
rotor. The separators may advantageously be air 
classifiers, of the ballistic, dimensional or cyclone 
type, each having a feed from below for elevation by the 
fluid inside the closed transport circuit, and an outlet 
from the top to the following separator. The separators form part of a closed pneumatic 
circuit having the function of impelling the crushed 
material through the said separators to permit separation 
according to the specific weights of the components. The 
closed circuit makes it possible to have a fluid in 
movement without humidity,

<CLAIMS>
Installation for the cryogenic transformation and 
sorting of solid municipal waste, comprising a rotor (3) 

in which the material - dried (in heat, in cold or in a 
vacuum) and treated to remove ferromagnetic metal if 

necessary - is made to advance, and into which a 
cryogenic fluid, such as liquid nitrogen and/or carbon 

dioxide or other, is fed to cool the material until it 
becomes brittle, and also comprising means of crushing 

and means of classified separation of components of the 
said waste, characterized in that at least one impact 

body (28), which acts in an area in which the material 
has already been made brittle by cooling, is provided in 

the rotor (3); in that internal appendages (30, 32) 
capable of raising, during the rotation of the rotor, any 

parts of the material, and also the said impact body or
