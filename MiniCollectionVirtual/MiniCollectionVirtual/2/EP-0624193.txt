<DESCRIPTION>
AAMP-l, A PROTEIN WITH LOCAL HOMOLOGIES TO HIV-1 ENV AND NEF PROTEINS.BACKGROUND 07 THE ZMVBHTZOKField of the Invention The present invention relates, in general, to AAMP-l. In particular, the present invention relates to a DNA segment encoding AAMP- 1; polypeptides encoded by the DNA segment; recombinant DNA molecules containing the DNA segment; cells containing the recombinant DNA molecule; a method of producing AAMP-l; antibodies specific to AAMP-l; and a method of measuring the amount of AAMP-l in a sample.Background InformationThe major histocompatibility complex class II proteins have recently been found to contain local homologies to the HIV-1 envelope protein (H. Golding et al., J. EXP. Med. 167, 914 (1988); H. Golding et al., J. Clin. Invest. 83, 1430 (1989); J. A. T. Young, Nature 332, 215 (1988)). Such homologous regions may serve as targets for antibodies generated to HIV-l proteins and thus compromise the immune system in AIDS. Golding et al. (J. EXP. Med. 167, 914 (1988)) have identified a common epitope located in the carboxy terminus of the HIV-l gp41-envelope protein and the amino terminal portion of the beta chain of all human HLA class II antigens. Although the epitope is small, 5 consecutive identities or similarities, they found that it is an effective example of "molecular mimicry n in that monoclonal antibodies raised against synthetic peptides from each protein react interchangeably with native HIV-l envelope and MHC class II molecules. One third of HIV-l positive individuals were shown to 

have serum antibodies directed against peptides derived from HIV-l envelope protein, the homologous peptide from the MHC class XI molecules, and native MHC class II molecules (H. Golding et al. J. EXP. Med. 167, 914 (1988)). Two other regions of the HLA class II beta chain and another immune related protein, interleukin-2, also show limited homology to HIV-l (J. A. T.Young, Nature 333, 215 (1988)).; M.A. Vega et al. Nature 345, 26 1990).; W. E. Reiher III, et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83. 9188 (1986)). An important consideration in HIV-l vaccine development is the potential existence of additional host cell surface proteins with ho ologies to HIV-l that may crossreact with antibodies directed against its peptides.The present invention relates to the protein AAMP-l which has immunoglobulin (Ig) type domains that contain strong local homologies to conserved regions of the HIV-l envelope and nef proteins.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is a general object of this invention to provide AAMP-l.
