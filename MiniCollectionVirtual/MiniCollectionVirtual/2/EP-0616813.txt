<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel antitumor
polymeric compositions and methods of treatment therewith.
More particularly, the invention relates to a
pharmaceutical composition comprising mitoxantrone, an
anthracene antitumor compound, covalently conjugated to a
divinyl ether-maleic anhydride (MVE) copolymer.Macromolecules have been used as drug carriers in an
attempt to prolong plasma levels of drugs presumably as a
result of slow release of drugs from macromolecules and to
achieve favourable uptake by the tumor cells. Among
macromolecular carriers, divinyl ether-maleic anhydride
(MVE) has been investigated extensively. MVE copolymer
contains multiple anhydride rings, which allows easy
funtionalization with antitumor agents carrying
nucleophilic groups such as -NH2, -OH and -SH. Furthermore,
a carboxyl group is generated from each anhydride ring
functionalized with a drug molecule. 
Therefore, MVE copolymer is capable of covalently
binding a large number of lipophilic antitumor agents,
while maintaining water solubility.MVE copolymer has been covalently linked with
various therapeutically active antitumor agents
including 5-fluorouridine, daunomycin, adriamycin,
Î²-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine and methotrexate with
varying results. Some of the MVE-linked agents
demonstrated higher therapeutic efficacies and lover
toxicities during in vivo antitumor evaluations while
others showed no increase or were unstable under
physiological conditions. MVE linked with methotrexate
through the 2- or 4-amino groups of the pteridine ring
of methotrexate showed only a alight increase in life
span (%ILB) against L1210 leukemia in mice when
compared with free methotrexate. MVE copolymer had a
potentiating effect on the antitumor activity of
5-aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine but had no therapeutic benefit
when used with cyclophosphamide under the same
experimental conditions of tumor burden and treatment
schedule. D.S. Zaharko et al., Canc. Treat. Rpts.
68(10): 1255-1264 (1984). U.S. Patent 4,520,162
discloses MVE-copolymer conjugates of adriamycin,
daunomycin and AraC.The anthracene antitumor agents are a group
of compounds having an anthracene moiety of which
mitoxantrone and bisantrene are representative members.
Mitoxantrone is indicated for treatment of acute
nonlymphocytic leukemia in humans. While these agents
exhibit excellent anti-tumor activity, they also exhibit
strong toxicity to normal cells. For example,
administration of mitoxantrone is associated with
myelosuppression and cardiac abnormalities as well as
other side
