<ABSTRACT>
An autofocusing system for a camera, wherein a defocus amount 
is detected by a light-amount-integration type detector 

means, depending upon which focusing operation is executed. 
The focusing operation is adjusted according to a conversion 
factor Kval which is corrected according to its change rate 

Kc in one of a plurality of sections of the focal length.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an autofocusing system 
of a camera adapted for use in forming an image of an 
object on a light receiving element of an amount-of-light 
integration type by means of luminous flux incident 
through a lens and obtaining the defocus amount of 
a lens with respect to the object by integrating the 
amount of light. The so-called TTL (Through-The-Lens) type focus detection 
system wherein the detection of the defocus amount 
depends on the state of the image formed with luminous 
flux transmitted through a photographic lens is widely 
employed as an automatic focusing system in such cameras 
as single-lens reflex cameras which require a true 
in-focus condition. In that case, a delivery-amount-of-lens conversion factor 
Kval is used to convert the defocus amount into AF 
(Auto-Focus) motor drive pulse numbers. The Kval in this specification is defined as a delivery 
amount of the lens per unit movement of an image 
surface. The term Kval may instead be defined as a 
movement of the image surface per unit delivery-amount  
 
of the lens; in the latter case, however, the size relation 
therebetween is reversed in the following description. Since the Kval takes different values on a focal length 
basis in the case of a zoom lens, it is stored as variable 
data in a ROM (Read Only Memory) provided in the 
lens unit. (The lens system having variable focal 
length can either be zoom lens system or variable-focal 
lens system. Accordingly, although explanations will be 
given only to the zoom lens system in this specification, 
it should be noted that the present invention can 
be similarly applicable to the variable-focal lens system.) According to the aforementioned definition, the longer 
the focal length, the smaller the Kval value becomes, 
and vice versa as represented by a curve shown by a 
broken line in Fig. 11. As the focal length of a lens 
is not directly detectable, the zoom ring position is 
shown, in Fig. 11, as a variable corresponding to the 
focal length. Conventionally, the Kval is obtained from a zoom code 
detected through brushes slidably in contact with a 
code plate supported by the zoom ring and a stationary 
ring of a lens barrel whereby it has been obtained as 
intermittent data providing one value between the zoom 
codes as shown by a continuous line in Fig. 1. This is 
also applicable to a case where the focal length is detected 
as shown in Fig. 12. In order to distinguish be  
 
tween the actual focal length and what is detected from 
the zoom code
