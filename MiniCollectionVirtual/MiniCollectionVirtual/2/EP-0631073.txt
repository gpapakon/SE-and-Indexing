<ABSTRACT>
A three-way diverter valve comprising a rotatable 
valve member (19) to which are mounted a number of sealing 

faces, each face being adapted to seal against one of the 
inlet (7a,7b) or outlet (9a,9b) of one of the paths the member (19) being 

movable between a first position in which both the inlet 
and outlet of a first path are sealed, and both the inlet 

and outlet of the second path are open for fluid to flow 
therethrough, and a second position in which both the 

inlet (7a,7b) and outlet (9a,9b) of the first path are open for fluid to 
flow therethrough and both the inlet and outlet of the 

second path are sealed, movement of the member (19) effecting 
sealing or opening of the inlet (7a,7b) and outlet (9a,9b) of each flow 

path substantially simultaenously, both paths being at 
least partially open for fluid to flow therethrough when 

the member (19) is between the first and second positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for
diverting the flow of a fluid between at least two paths.It is often necessary to divert the flow of fluid
from a path passing through one process station to another
path which passes through another process station. For
example, where the fluid flow passes through a filter, it
is frequently necessary to divert the fluid flow along a
different path containing another filter, so that the
first filter may be exchanged or cleaned. In such a
system it will eventually become necessary to divert the
fluid flow again, so that the second filter may be
exchanged or replaced. Alternatively, the fluid flow may
be diverted between two paths in which different processes
are carried out on the fluid flowing therethrough.In known liquid filtration systems, for example,
two parallel liquid flow paths are provided each
containing a filter, and having a diverter valve at both
the inlet of the two paths and also at the outlets of the
two paths. The flow of liquid is diverted between the two
paths by operating the two diverter valves so as to close
the inlet and outlet of one of the paths and halt the
liquid flow therethrough and to open the inlet and outlet
of the other path.The provision of two separate diverter valves is
expensive and, in order that there be no interruption in
the flow of liquid through the system whilst the flow is
diverted between the two paths, either expensive control
means must be provided so that the two diverter valves
operate simultaneously, or the operator must take great
care so as to ensure that both valves operate
simultaneously. Where, as is often the case, the diverter
valves are not manually operable, there are considerable
problems in ensuring simultaneous operation of the two
valves. In DE-A-27 10 844 a device is described in
which a rotary valve is mounted in a cylindrical cavity
of a cock casing. The valve is formed with two
cylindrical surfaces comprising deformable material, for
engagement over respective cavities. The rotary valve
is mounted on a loose bearing so that as it turns a
sealing face can engage the casing. When a face is over
a cavity fluid pressure in the valve deforms the surface
material to make a seal.The present invention is directed at apparatus
for diverting the flow of a fluid from one path to
another path, both paths being defined in a housing
having a longitudinal axis. The apparatus comprises a
valve member having a number of sealing faces, and
rotatably mounted in the housing, each face being
adapted to seal against

Apparatus for diverting the flow of a fluid from
one path to another path, both paths being defined in a

housing having a longitudinal axis, comprising a valve
member (19) having a number of sealing faces (21, 23)

and rotatably mounted in the housing, each face being
adapted to seal against one of the inlet (7) and outlet

(9) of one of the paths, the member (19) being movable
between a first position in which both the inlet (7b)

and outlet (9b) of the second path are open for fluid to
flow therethrough, and both the inlet (7a) and outlet

(9a) of the first path are sealed, and a second position
in which both the inlet (7a) and outlet (9a) of the

first path are open for fluid to flow therethrough and
both the inlet (7b) and outlet (9b) of the second path

are sealed, movement of the member (19) effecting
sealing or opening of the inlet and outlet of each flow

path substantially simultaneously, and both paths being
at least partially open for fluid to flow therethrough

when the member (19) is between the first and second
positions, characterised in that the valve member (19)

is pivotally mounted with its pivot axis parallel to,
but not coincident with, the longitudinal axis of the

housing, and that each sealing face (21, 23) on the
valve member (19) defines a section of a cylindrical

surface, the cylindrical sealing faces being eccentric
with respect to the pivot axis (31) of the valve member.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the inlet
and outlet (7, 9) to each path comprises a port formed

in a wall of the housing, each sealing surface (21, 23)
on the rotatable member (19) having a radius

substantially equal to the radius of the housing.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein
the longitudinal axes of the cylindrical sealing faces

path are coaxial. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim wherein
the housing is cylindrical having a substantially

constant internal radius.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim wherein
a groove is provided for mounting a soft seal (29)

around either the periphery of each sealing face (21,
23) or each fluid path inlet and outlet, to improve the

seal therebetween.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim wherein
the valve member (19) is mounted within a cylindrical

housing on coaxial stub shafts (25, 27) of equal
diameter, the ends of the stub shafts extending through

the housing.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim
including means for relieving fluid pressure within each

path when the inlet (7) and outlet (9) to the path is
sealed, and means for emptying the fluid from that path

and for allowing access to the path.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim
including filter means (11a, 11b) in either or both

paths.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim wherein
the sealing faces (21, 23) are integral with the valve

member (19).
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim wherein
the sealing faces (21, 23) are arranged in

circumferentially spaced pairs, each pair of sealing
faces being adapted to seal against either the inlets

(7) or the outlets (9) of the first and second paths. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 10 wherein the pairs
