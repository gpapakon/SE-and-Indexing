<ABSTRACT>
A graph display apparatus of this invention can 
simultaneously display a plurality of graphs on divided 

display screen areas. First and second formula data 
input by numericÂ·symbol keys on a key input unit (11) 

are stored in registers (25a, 25b) in a RAM (23) 
together with their range setting codes (R0 through R3) 

and screen designation codes (A and B). Upon operation 
of a "division" key, the graph of the first formula 

stored in the register (25a) is calculated in accordance 
with X- and Y-coordinate ranges read out from an R0 

register (26a) in correspondence with, e.g., a range 
setting code "R0", is written in a first memory area 

(24a) of a VRAM (24) in correspondence with a screen 
designation code "A", and is displayed on the first 

screen area on a display unit (12). The graph of the 
second formula stored in the register (25b) is calculated 

in accordance with X- and Y-coordinate ranges read 
out from an R1 register (26b) in correspondence with, 

e.g., a range setting code "R1", is written in a second 

memory area (24b) of the VRAM (24) in correspondence 
with a screen designation code "B", and is displayed on 

the second screen area.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a graph display apparatus according to the
preamble of claim 1 and to a graph display control method to be used in a
graph display control apparatus according to the preamble of claim 4.For example, electronic calculators which have a functional calculation
function and also have a graph display function for calculating and displaying
the graph of an input functional formula have been commercially available.More specifically, X-coordinate values in units of display dots are substituted in
a functional formula in accordance with X- and Y-coordinate (Xmin, Xmax) and
(Ymin, Ymax) which are designated in advance on a display screen, and
calculated Y-coordinate values are sequentially written on a VRAM (Video
Random Access Memory), thus displaying the graph of the functional formula.
Such a graph display technique is described in, e.g., USP 4,794,553, USP
4,794,554, and the like.However, in the conventional graph display apparatus, since a graph is
displayed in accordance with predetermined X- and Y-coordinate ranges, if a
plurality of graphs are to be simultaneously displayed, the same coordinate
ranges must be set, and graphs with different coordinate ranges cannot be
displayed in comparison with each other to perform analysis. Patent Abstracts of Japan vol. 16, no. 508 (P-1463) December 25, 1992 & JP-A-04

discloses a compact electronic computer with a graph display function. This
computer allows to display two different graphs on the basis of inputted
coordinate data and range data. The two graphs are displayed together.Patent Abstract of Japan vol. 17, no, 509 (P-1612) September 13, 1993 & JP-A-05

shows a waveform display device comprising two different display areas on a
display screen one of them for displaying an overall waveform and the other
one for displaying selected portions in an enlarged scale. Two slide bars are
provided for defining the position of the overall waveform to be enlarged. The present invention has as its object to provide a graph display apparatus
and a graph display control method to be used in a graph display control
apparatus which can simultaneously display a graph and in an enlarged scale
a freely selected portion thereof.The above object, is achieved according to the present invention by a graph
display apparatus having the features of claim 1 and by a graph display control
method to be used in a graph display control apparatus having
