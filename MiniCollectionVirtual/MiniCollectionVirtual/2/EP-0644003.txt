<ABSTRACT>
Procedures for the elaboration, handling and industrial use of flexible metallic profiles, 
consisting of the mechanization of wide hoops which are died and adjusted throughout a cold 

process in order to obtain the T-, M-, angle-shaped profiles, and the like, with the main 
characteristic of being easily curved in one of their sides, without being necessary to use 

neither any tool nor heating processes, because the other sides of the profile do not show any 
resistance, as they are made of planes with grooves which relative shifts, by sliding ones over 

the others. The handling and use of these profiles need of a manual configuration on patterns, 
models or plans as designed, and the later rigidity throughout solid junctions which fix the 

shifted position of the grooved planes, thereby maintaining the requested curve.

<DESCRIPTION>
Procedures for the elaboration, handling and industrial use of flexible metallic 
profiles, consisting of the mechanization of wide hoops which are died and adjusted 
throughout a cold process in order to obtain the T-, M-, angle-shaped profiles, and 
the like, with the main characteristic of being easily curved in one of their sides, 
without being necessary to use neither any tool nor heating processes, because the 
other sides of the profile do not show any resistance, as they are made of planes with 
grooves which relative shifts, by sliding ones over the others. The handling and use 
of these profiles need of a manual configuration on patterns, models or plans as 
designed, and the later rigidity throughout solid junctions which fix the shifted 
position of the grooved planes, thereby maintaining the requested curve.  a) Invention patent for: Procedures for the elaboration, handling and industrial use of 
flexible metallic profiles. b) The technical sector which the present patent is referred to, is the production of 
metallic profiles of industrial application. c) This is an industrial sector with a great activity since many years ago, but with 
techniques which have not experimented any relevant technological innovations. This 
could be because the projects which structural elements are metallic profiles, the 
design has traditionally avoided the previous expensive adjustment of the conventional 
commercial materials, using cuttings and junctions of straight pieces in order to get 
closer to a theoretical request of a continuous curve. Within some projects this 
approach is not possible when a curve with a strict configuration and a perfect surface 
finishing is necessary. d) In order to address all these problems and to allow an easy curving of the metallic 
profiles, overcoming all the above mentioned difficulties, the present privilege of 
Invention Patent on new procedures for the elaboration, handling and industrial use 
of flexible metallic profiles is requested, mainly consisting of the following 
procedures: 
We start from metallic hoops with a wide and plane shape, which allow to be 
conformed with a cold process. The width, thickness and characteristics of the 
metallic plane which are processed are the necessary ones for the profile requested 
in each case. The mechanization consists of a continuous stamping of repeated grooves using the 
specific tools for the elaboration of a concrete profile. The consecutive operations are 
progressive conformings within the outlining band and some

<CLAIMS>
Procedure for the elaboration, handling and industrial use of flexible metallic 
profiles, characterized in that these procedures are a sequence of continuous 

mechanizations over bands of metallic grooves, with a width, thickness and features 
specific for the elaborated profile. These features are subject to sucessive operations 

of puncture of repeated grooved shapes and to progressive foldings of conformation 
by cold process in the outlined machines, so that the final product easily respond to 

the requests of a flexible configuration foreseen in the invention's declaration and 
which is a consequence of the disposition of stamped grooves, making possible to 

open or close the grooved spaces, thus getting the shifts between the two or more 
planes which are part of the mentioned sides or wings. This makes possible that the 

profile's side, not necessarily stamped, be curved by means of patterns, models or 
outlines according to the definitive configuration. 
Procedures for the elaboration, handling and industrial use of flexible metallic 
profiles, characterized by the previous claim and further characterized in that the 

profile obtained in continuous is cut off in long transportable pieces or is supplied in 
rolls to the manufacturer of structures, thus he can work with it without length 

limitations. 
Procedures for the elaboration, handling and industrial use of flexible metallic 
profiles, characterized by the previous claims and further characterized in that the 

profile obtained is rigidized by means of conventional systems for solid junctions 
between the grooved planes once it has been definitively curved.
