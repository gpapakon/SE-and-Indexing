<ABSTRACT>
A flat screen cathode ray tube display (10) is self-supporting. A multiplicity of supports extend from an addressing grid structure (35) to contact the inside surface of a face plate (12) between pixels. A back plate (16) is similarly supported against the addressing structure (35). The addressing structure (35) itself is formed of a series of ceramic plates or layers. A matrix of very small holes (44) is formed in each plate. The holes (44), in registry in the laminated addressing grid structure (35), each have adjacent conductive metal traces (54) deposited on the ceramic surfaces, and these traces (54), connected by vias (56, 58) between layers, form a grid of connectors which permit the addressing of each pixel in a sequence in accordance with an input signal such as a video signal. Addressing traces (54) preferably extend between ceramic layers under the hermetic seal of the CRT (10) so that the seal does not directly cross any addressing traces (54).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is concerned with flat screen displays, and in particular the invention relates to a flat, thin cathode ray tube structure which utilizes a flat, generally uniform array of electrons, passed selectively through an addressing grid to address pixels on an electron-excitable coated face plate. This is in contrast to a scanned ray of electrons as in conventional CRTs.Flat screen video displays have been known in concept and have been a common goal in the video/television industry for some years. For examples of this and related technology, see U.S. Patents Nos. 3,566,187, 3,612,944, 3,622,828, 3,956,667, 4,088,920, 4,227,117, 4,341,980, 4,435,672, 4,531,122, 4,564,790 and 4,719,388. Such flat screen display structures have been intended to eliminate the very deep profile of televisions and other CRT displays, required because of the electron scanning gun which must be a certain proportionate distance behind the phosphor coated face plate, this distance increasing with screen size. Other goals of flat screen television have been reduction of weight, avoiding the requirement of high voltage for larger screens, truly flat face plates, and reduced cost of manufacture.Numerous alternative thin, flat screen technologies have been developed which are either currently used in display applications or show distinct promise for such applications. These applications typically require low power, require light weight and/or small size (characteristics provided in varying degrees by these flat screen displays) and do not require the video speeds, full color, high screen resolution, or other features that can currently only be accomplished by conventional cathode ray tube displays. Hence, although many new applications have developed for flat screen technologies, these technologies have not significantly penetrated the existing large applications for CRTs, such as television and desktop computer.For example: the conventional twisted pneumatic and supertwist liquid crystal displays ("LCDs") have very low power and cost in monochrome modes, but do not have sufficient speed, gray shades, uniformity, power efficiency and resolution to be used in television and many computer applications, which require full color and video rates. More advanced LCD technologies have also been produced, such as ferroelectric LCDs which switch at video speeds. However, this technology still has significant gray scale, manufacturing, reliability and life problems which must be overcome before it can be used in full color and video
