<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a developing
agent recycling apparatus for recycling a
developing agent (developer) from a mixture of
developer and other matters, and an image forming
apparatus using such developing agent recycling
apparatus.In the past, after a developer image was
transferred from an image bearing member to a
recording material, residual matters remaining on the
image bearing member were removed from the image
bearing member by a cleaning blade and the like and
such residual matters were disposed as the waste
matter. From a view-point of the effective usage of
resources, various apparatuses for separating the
developing agent from the residual matters and
apparatuses for reusing such developing agent have
been proposed. Among them, various apparatuses
wherein the residual matters are dropped onto a mesh
filter to separate the developing agent passed through
the filter from the other matters not passed
through the filter have been proposed since they have 
the simple construction.However, when the developing agent is
separated from the other matters by using the
filter (particularly, mesh filter) to recycle the
developing agent, there arises a problem that the
mesh is clogged by the other matter such as paper
powder included in the residual matter removed from
the image bearing member. In particular, when the
mesh is made smaller to remove the smaller other
matters, the mesh is apt to be clogged. Accordingly,
the maintenance of the recycling apparatus must be
performed frequently, and, thus, it was difficult to
put such recycling apparatus to practical use.In order to solve this problem, there has been
proposed an apparatus wherein a magnetic field is
generated by a pair of magnets to fly magnetic
toner in the residual matter removed from an image
bearing member in a direction opposite to the gravity
acting direction and a mesh filter is provided between
the pair of magnets to regulate the passage of
foreign matters such as paper powder flying together
with the magnetic toner through the filter.By this apparatus, the other matters
consisting of the non-magnetic matters such as the
paper powder regulated by the mesh filter are
separated from the magnetic toner, and the separated other
matters are dropped by their own weights to 
leave the mesh filter, thereby effectively preventing
the clogging of the mesh.However, when the apparatus is in an
inoperative condition for a long time, the triboelectric
brush of the magnetic toner (including the
foreign matters such as the paper powder) is
