<ABSTRACT>
A normally solid recording material (3) is heat-melted 
in a path defined by a nozzle (15) leading to an 

ejection outlet (5) and is imparted with a thermal energy 
corresponding to a recording signal to generate a 

bubble. As a result, a droplet of the recording 
material (7) is ejected out of the ejection outlet (5) under 

the action of the bubble (6) while the bubble (6) is 
communicated with the ambience. The normally solid 

recording material (3) preferably contains a colorant, a 
first heat-fusible solid substance having a melting 

point Tm of 36-150°C and a boiling point Tb of 150-370°C, 
and a second heat-fusible solid substance 

having a melting point Tm and a solidifying point Tf 
satisfying a relationship of 


Tm - Tf ≦ 30°C

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet
recording method wherein a recording material which is
solid at room temperature is discharged or ejected out
of a recording medium and of a recording material which
can be used in the aforesaid method.In the jet recording method, droplets of a
recording material (ink) are ejected to be attached to
a recording medium such as paper for accomplishing
recording. In. the method disclosed in U.S. Patents
Nos. 4,410,899, 4,723,129 and 4,723,129 assigned to the
present assignee among the known jet recording methods,
a normally liquid ink is used, a bubble is generated in
the ink by applying a heat energy to the ink, and an
ink droplet is ejected through an ejection outlet
(orifice), whereby a recording head provided with high-density
multi-orifices can be easily realized to record
a high-quality image having a high resolution at a high
speed.In addition to the above, known liquid jet 
recording methods may include the following.Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application (JP-A)
161935/1979 discloses a recording method as illustrated
in Figure 22, wherein a liquid ink 31 in a chamber is
gasified by operation of a heater 30 energized through
electrodes 35, and the resultant gas 32 is ejected
together with an ink droplet 33 through an ejection
outlet. It is said that the plugging of an orifice can
be prevented due to ejection of the gas 32 through a
nozzle.JP-A 185455/1986 discloses a recording method
as illustrated in Figures 23A - 23C, wherein a liquid
ink 44 filling a minute gap 43 between a plate member
41 having a pore 40 and a heat-generating head 42 is
heated by the head 42 (Figures 23A and 23B), and an ink
droplet 46 is ejected by the created bubble 45 through
the pore 40 together with the gas constituting the
bubble (Figure 23C) to form an image on recording
paper.JP-A 249768/1986 discloses a recording method
as illustrated in Figures 24A and 24B, wherein a liquid
ink 50 is supplied with a heat energy by a heating
member 51 to form a bubble, and an ink droplet 58 is
ejected by expansion force of the bubble together with
the gas constituting the bubble through a large
aperture to the ambience.JP-A 197246/1986 discloses a recording method 
as illustrated in Figure 25, wherein ink 62 filling a
plurality of bores 61 formed in a film 60 is heated by
a recording head 64 having a heating element 63 to
generate a bubble 67 in the ink 62, thus ejecting an
ink droplet 65 onto a recording medium 66 (at (a) - (f)
in order in Figure 25).The inks used in the jet recording method
