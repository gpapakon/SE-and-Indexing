<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a condition
detecting system which performs detection of the
condition of a person in an observing sector in a building
or a house by using detecting means including a plurality
of distance sensors.Previously, in order to detect the condition of a
person in a specific area, it has been normally practiced
that a picture in the space is measured by a CCD camera
or an infrared ray camera and an observer directly
performs observation through a monitoring screen, or
that a person in the area is cut out of the picture and
the recognition of the person is performed by a picture
recognizing system.In the former case, it is necessary to watch the
monitoring screen at all times, and it is difficult to
cover a plurality of observing areas, and in the latter
case, the system is considerably expensive, and the uses 
are limited. Furthermore, judgment is difficult as for
the attitude of the person or the like.Moreover, a method of using an observing camera
like this ignores the privacy of a patient in a hospital
or a facility, which causes a problem. For example, in
a toilet of the hospital or the like, in case when a long
time has elapsed after a patient entered, there is an
anxiety about the safety of the patient, and in case of
a conventional method, it is necessary to confirm
whether the patient is staying there for a long time or
not, or whether the patient has fallen down in the toilet
or not.However, the confirmation must be performed while
keeping the privacy. For that, a patrol, a nurse, or
the like performs checking, and both labor and time are
required, and there has been no simple, easy, and
inexpensive system which can detect the condition of the
patient staying in an observing sector such as a toilet
like this.The present invention is made due to the above
various conventional problems, and it is an object of
the present invention to provide a condition detecting
system, which detects simply and at a low cost the 
condition of an observing sector such as a toilet in a
home of a solitary old person, a hospital, a nursing
facility, or the like while keeping the privacy.The present invention relates to a condition
detecting system for detecting the existence and the
condition of a person in a specific observing sector,
which comprises detecting means including a plurality
of pieces of distance sensors arranged at one corner of
the observing sector and judging means for judging the
condition of a staying person in the observing sector

<CLAIMS>
A condition detecting system for detecting
existence and condition of a person in a specific

observing sector comprising:

detecting means including a plurality of pieces of
distance sensors arranged at one corner of said

observing sector; and
judging means for judging condition of a staying
person in said observing sector on the basis of

information from the detecting means,
wherein each of said plurality of pieces of distance

sensors is set to be able to detect condition of the
person in a different direction.
The condition detecting system according to claim
1 further comprising signal processing means including

a signal transmitting section for transmitting results
of judgment attained by said judging means.
The condition detecting system according to claim
2 further comprising warning means for issuing a waning

on the basis of a signal from said signal transmitting
section.
The condition detecting system according to claim
3 further comprising warning canceling means for

performing cancel of said warning means.
The condition detecting system according to any one
of claim 1 to claim 3, wherein said plurality of pieces

of distance sensors are distance sensors using infrared
ray beams, or ultrasonic sensors using transmitting and

receiving of ultrasonic waves, or combinations of said
two kinds of sensors.
The condition detecting system according to claim
3, wherein said warning means works when said judging

means judges that a person whose existence is detected
does not go out even if a previously determined specified

time has elapsed, or when said judging means judges that
the person is in an abnormal condition.
The condition detecting system according to any one
of claim 1 to claim 6, wherein said judging means and

said data transmitting section are included in signal
processing means and the judging means is realized in

terms of software by using a computer.
The condition detecting system according to any one
of claim 1 to claim 7, wherein said observing sector is

a toilet, and staying of a user of the toilet for a long
time or an abnormal condition is detected by detecting

means including a plurality of pieces of distance
sensors arranged at one corner in said toilet.
The condition detecting system according to claim
8, wherein said toilet is a Western style toilet and said

detecting means is arranged at the front of the Western
style toilet or at the upper back portion.

one of claim 1 to claim 7, wherein said observing sector

is a washing room, and staying for a long time or an
abnormal attitude such as falling down or crouching down

is detected by detecting means including a plurality of
pieces of distance sensors arranged at one corner in the

washing room.
The condition detecting system according to any
one of claim 1 to claim 7, wherein said observing sector

is a bath room, and staying for a long time or an abnormal
attitude such as falling down or crouching down in a

washing place or a bath tub is detected by detecting means
including a plurality of pieces of distance sensors

arranged at one corner of the bath room.
A condition detecting system for detecting
condition of a person covering a plurality of observing

sectors, wherein detecting means including a plurality

detecting means is inputted into one judging means which

judges condition of a staying person in said observing
sector on the basis of information from the detecting

means.
The condition detecting system according to claim
12 further comprising warning means for issuing a

warning on the basis of a signal from said judging means.
The condition detecting system according to claim
13 further comprising warning canceling means for

canceling a warning of said warning means.
The condition detecting system according to any
one of claim 12 to 14, wherein when said judging means

judges that a person is staying for a long time after

a certain time has elapsed, or when said judging means
judges that abnormality occurs in an attitude of a

staying person, said judging means reports the result
of judgment to a centralized control system such as a

nurse call system as a contact point signal.
The condition detecting system according to claim
15, wherein said centralized control system turns on and

off a separate corridor light or a separate warning lamp,
or issues a warning alarm on the basis of said result

of judgment.
The condition detecting system according to claim
15, wherein the warning is canceled and at the same time

and measuring is automatically resumed by canceling of
