<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates to the production of 
foam for beverages. The specification is particularly, 
but not exclusively, concerned with the production of a 
head of foam on beer dispensed from relatively small 
containers such as cans, bottles and the like. Whilst many systems exist for providing a stable, 
tight head on beer dispensed from casks and other bulk 
containers, it has long been recognised that there are 
problems if seeking to achieve the same effect on beer 
dispensed from containers such as cans and bottles. Any 
head tends to come from the natural effervescence of the 
beer as dissolved carbon dioxide comes out of solution 
when the container is opened, and from excitation of the 
beer as it is poured into a glass. To a certain extent 
the head formation can be improved by using a 
combination of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, but simply 
doing this does not produce a head as good as that on 
beer pumped from casks and the like. There is a 
particular problem in the case of canned beers intended 
to provide similar qualities to traditional draught 
beers, where there is a significantly lower CO2 content 
than in other canned beers. It has therefore been proposed to inject gas into 
the beverage when the container is opened, so as to 
promote the formation of bubbles which will provide the 
foam. This has been done by providing a secondary 
chamber containing gas at above atmospheric pressure, 
which is ejected into the main beverage through an 
orifice when the container is opened, due to the 
pressure difference across the relatively small orifice. 
In some known arrangements the secondary chamber 
communicates permanently while the main body of beverage 
and in others there is provided a valve.  
 In GB-A-1,266,351 there is disclosed a bottle with 
a cap having a secondary chamber attached to it. This 
is in permanent communication with the main body of the 
beverage and contains gas under pressure, at equilibrium 
with the remainder of the bottle. There are also 
disclosed cans with secondary chambers in their bases, 
which are provided with valves. Similar arrangements 
are shown in GB-A-1,331,425. In GB-A-2,183,592 there is provided a secondary 
chamber in the form of a plastic insert which is pushed 
down inside a can. The chamber is provided with an 
orifice which communicates permanently with the main 
body. After sealing the can, beverage enters the insert 
to compress the gas therein, which is normally nitrogen. 
It is stated that subsequent ejection of gas and/or 
beverage
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A container (22) of beverage sealed under pressure, the 
container being provided with a secondary chamber in the 

form of a hollow insert (1) adapted to provide a flow of gas 
through an orifice (5) into the beverage when the container 

is opened, wherein the insert is in the form of an 
elongate tubular member, characterised in that the axis of the tubular 

member extends around an axis corresponding generally to the axis 
of the container. 
A container (22) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the axis 
of the insert follows a curved path. 
A container (22) as claimed in claim 2, wherein the 
container has a cylindrical wall and the insert (1) lies 

against and extends around the wall. 
A container (22) as claimed in claim 3, wherein the 
insert (1) is resilient and exerts an outward force against 

the wall. 
A container (22) as claimed in claim 3 or 4, wherein a 
resilient sleeve (24) is provided to assist in retaining the 

insert, the sleeve being positioned above the insert (1) and 
engaging the wall of the container. 
A container (22) as claimed in any preceding claim, 

wherein the insert (1) is positioned at the base of the 
container. 
A container (22) as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the orifice (5) establishes permanent communication 

between the interior of the insert and the beverage in 
the container. 
A container (22) as claimed in claim 7, wherein the 
insert (1) contains beverage which has entered the insert  

 
through the orifice (5). 
A container (22) as claimed in claim 8, wherein the 
insert (1) has the gas as a headspace (30) above the beverage. 
A container (22) as claimed in claim 8 or 9, wherein the 
beverage in the insert covers the orifice (5). 
A container (22) as claimed in claim 8, 9 or 10, wherein 
the orifice (5) is positioned such as to define below the 

orifice a substantial volume in the insert (1) in which 
beverage is held. 
A container (22) as claimed in claim 11, wherein the 
orifice (5) is provided in a region approximately mid-way up 

the insert (1). 
A container (22) as claimed in any of claims 7 to 12, 
wherein the orifice (5) points laterally towards the axis of 

the container. 
A container (22) as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the insert (1) is in the form of an extruded tube, 

sealed at both ends. 
A container (22) as claimed in claim 14, wherein the 
insert (1) is corrugated. 
A container (22) as claimed in any preceding claim, 
which has been subjected to a pasteurizing treatment in 

an inverted condition. 
A container (22) as claimed in claim 16, wherein there 
is a headspace of gas (29) in the container and the orifice (5) 

of the insert (1) communicates with the headspace when the 
container is inverted.
