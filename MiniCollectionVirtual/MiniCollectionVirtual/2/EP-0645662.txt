<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal display device comprises a pair of substrates, 
a transparent electrode formed on each of the substrates, an 

orientation film covering the transparent electrode and a 
liquid crystal sealedly sandwiched between the pair of 

substrates, wherein the orientation film comprises a polyimide 
which is formed by a condensation polymerization of 2,2-bis[4-(4-aminophenoxy)phenyl]
propane 
as an amine component and 

1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic dianhydride as an carboxylic 
acid component, and is subjected to a uniaxial orientation 

treatment, and the liquid crystal has a smectic layer structure 
with its bending direction which is aligned with the direction 

of the uniaxial orientation treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display
device, more particularly, to a liquid crystal display device
using a ferroelectric liquid crystal.Conventional liquid crystal display devices mainly use
nematic liquid crystals. The nematic liquid crystal display
devices include Twisted Nematic (TN) type and Supertwisted
Birefringence Effect (SBE) type. The TN-type liquid crystal
display device has a disadvantage that satisfactory contrast
cannot be obtained because the driving margin has been reduced
in accordance with the development of the driving mode to be
multiplex. Likewise, the SBE-type liquid crystal display
device, or an improvement of the TN-type liquid crystal display
which makes use of a larger twist angle, has a disadvantage of
reduced contrast and slow response when applied to a large-scale
display. To overcome the foregoing shortcomings, N. A.
Clark and S. T. Lagerwall proposed a liquid crystal display 
device using a chiral smectic C liquid crystal, i.e., a
ferroelectric liquid crystal in 1980, as disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 4,367,924 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
56-107216 (1981).Unlike conventional nematic liquid crystal display devices
utilizing electrical tilt effect developed by the dielectric
anisotropy of liquid crystal molecules, the proposed liquid
crystal display device utilizes rotatory power for aligning the
polarity of spontaneous polarization of a ferroelectric liquid
crystal with the polarity of electric field. This liquid
crystal display device is mainly characterized by bistability,
memory function, fast response, and wide viewing angle. When
the ferroelectric liquid crystal is injected into a cell having
a thin gap, the helical structure of the ferroelectric liquid
crystal is unwound by the effect of the substrate boundary, and
the bistability appears wherein there exist two stable regions
in which liquid crystal molecules 11 are tilted by +  degrees
17 and by -  degrees 18 with respect to the normal of a
smectic layer 12, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The application of
electric field 16 to the ferroelectric liquid crystal in the
cell allows the liquid crystal molecules 11 and their
spontaneous polarization 15 to have a uniform orientation.
Accordingly, the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules 11 
can be switched from one state to the other by
switching the polarity of the electric field to be applied.The switching operation alters the birefringence of the
ferroelectric liquid crystal in the cell and, hence, the light
transmission can be
