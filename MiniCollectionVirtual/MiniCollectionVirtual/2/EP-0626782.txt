<ABSTRACT>
A convex interpolation apparatus and method to 
map source color signals in a n-dimensional color space to 

target color signals in a m-dimensional color space 
includes finding a set of sample signals in the source 

color space whose convex hull encloses the given signal; 
determining the coefficients needed to express the given 

signal as a convex combination of the set of sample 
signals; and interpolating the source signal to obtain a 

target signal in the target color space by using the 
coefficients and the sample signals is the target color 

space that correspond to the sample signals selected in the 
source color space. The sample signals in both color 

spaces can be lattice points or non-lattice points. A 
method and apparatus are also provided which can not only 

determine if a point is enclosed by a convex hull of a set 
of points in a n-dimensional space, but also simultaneously 

derive the coefficients needed to express the given point 
as a convex combination of the set of points.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to the 
concurrently filed applications entitled Method And 
Apparatus For Mapping Between Color Spaces and 
Creating a Three Dimensional Inverse Lookup Table by 
Wan, Miller and Sullivan having US serial number 
068,941 and Method And Apparatus For Determining A 
Gamut Boundary And A Gamut Descriptor by Wan having 
US serial number 068,887, both incorporated by 
reference herein. The present invention is directed to a 
method of converting color data from one color space 
or coordinate system to another color space or 
coordinate system using convex interpolation and, 
more particularly, to determining whether a color 
value, point or signal to be interpolated is within 
a convex hull of the color values, points or signals 
in the neighborhood of the point in a first color 
space and, if so, determining the interpolation 
weights required to obtain the corresponding target 
color value in the second space using the points in 
the second space that correspond to the surrounding 
points in the first space. Interpolation using look-up tables (LUT) 
is an approach used for color calibration in both  
 
transforming color signals from one color space to 
another color space and in creating tables used for 
such transformations. A basic goal in color 
calibration is to reproduce color images generated 
from one device on another device without loss or 
with minimum loss of color fidelity. Fig. 1 
illustrates a color calibration process to reproduce 
a color image for device I on device II. In Fig. 1, 
the input image is represented in a device-dependent 
color space (DDCS1) 10, the output image is 
represented in another device-dependent color space 
(DDCS2) 12, the transformation between DDCS1 and 
DDCS2 is performed through a device-independent 
color space (DICS) 14. The relationship between a DDCS and a DICS 
can be described by a LUT which is obtained by 
measuring a number of color patches generated from 
the specific device. For convenience, the code 
values of these color patches are usually chosen to 
be lattice points spanning the full range of the 
DDCS, while their corresponding points in the DICS 
may be spaced irregularly. An interpolation from a 
DDCS to a DICS is a called forward interpolation, 
and an interpolation from a DICS to a DDCS is called 
a backward interpolation as illustrated in Fig. 2. We now consider the following general 
interpolation problem. Let X = {x₁, x₂, ..., xs} be 
a set of points in a n-dimensional vector space Rn(s 
> n), and Y = {y₁, y₂,
