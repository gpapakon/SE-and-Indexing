 DescriptionDISCRETE COSINE TRANSFORMER UTILIZING A DISCRETE FOURIER TRANSFORMERTechnical FieldA device for converting discrete Fourier transform technology into discrete cosine transform technology is disclosed.Background ArtThe Discrete Cosine Transform ("DCT") is well known to those skilled in the art. In some applications, for example image compression (the reduction of the amount of storage necessary to hold an image ) , the Discrete Cosine Transform is extensively used. The DCT represents an input sequence of N real numbers as a weighted sum of N distinct cosine curves. Each of these N cosine curves has a different frequency (the number of times the curve completes a cycle from 1 through 0, -1, 0 and back to l as the independent variable ranges from 0 to N). The output of a DCT is the collection of these N weights.The DCT represents the input sequence as a weighted sum of periodic curves; the word "periodic" means that, after a certain real number p (the period), the values repeat so that the value at position p is the same as the value at the initial position 0, and in general the value at position p + x is the same as the value at position x. Thus the DCT assumes that the input sequence of N real numbers is a part of an infinite periodic sequence of real numbers.The DCT differs from the Discrete Fourier Transform, the most popular data sequence transformation technology, in the way in which the input sequence of N real numbers is a part of the infinite periodic sequence of real numbers.The Discrete Fourier Transform("DFT") is a widely used signal processing and analysis concept; and sophisticated signal processing systems have been developed based upon its features. DFT devices are used in a great variety of fields 

 such as, e.g., applied mechanics, sonics and acoustics, biomedical engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, radar, electromagnetics, communications, and the like. See, for example, pages 1-3 of E. Oran Brigham's "The Fast Fourier Transform and its Applications" (Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1988).One of the most important uses of transform technology is "filtering." Some applications of filtering are image enÂ¬ hancement, target detection in radar, refocusing, and image compression. The process of "filtering" is achieved by transforming a given input sequence, either with the DCT or DFT or perhaps some other Fourier type transform, modifying the transformed sequence, and then performing an inverse transform on the modified transformed sequence.
