<ABSTRACT>
A device for increasing the buckling strength of windscreen pillars (2) of a vehicle, in particular of sharply inclined windscreen pillars of a cabriolet (convertible), comprises a supporting strut (13) which interacts with an activating device, is aligned approximately horizontally in its rest position and extends in the upper region of a vehicle side door (3) with a door inner panel. In the event of danger one end, facing the windscreen pillar, of the supporting strut is moved by means of the activating device upwards along a guide rail as far as an upper end region (22) of the windscreen pillar into an operative position. In order to provide a device of the generic type mentioned at the beginning, which device operates well with a simple design and low weight and with which the vehicle door can easily be opened, even after the vehicle has turned over, and does not place restrictions on the free design of the vehicle door, it is proposed that in its rest position the supporting strut be secured releasably on an impression in the vehicle door, which impression faces the passenger compartment, whereas in its pivoted-up position C or its operative position B the supporting strut is completely disengaged from the vehicle door, and in the operative position B is connected at one end to the upper end region of the windscreen pillar and at the other end to a receptacle, which is arranged adjacent to the vehicle door and is fixed on the vehicle body, in a force-transmitting manner.

A device for increasing the buckling resistance of windscreen columns (2) of a vehicle, in 
particular of substantially inclined windscreen columns (2) of a cabriolet, wherein the 

device comprises at least one support brace (13) which cooperates with an activating 
device (12) and extends substantially in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle and 

which is orientated substantially horizontally in the lowered position (
A
) thereof and 
extends in an upper region of a side door (3) of the vehicle provided with an inner panel 

(7), whereas in the event of danger one end of the support brace (13) facing the 
windscreen column (2) is raised by the activating device (12) along a guide rail (18) on 

the windscreen column (2) as far as the upper end region (22) thereof to arrive in an 
operative position, 
characterized in that
 in its lowered position (
A
) the support brace 
(13) is detachably secured against an impressed portion (14) of the vehicle door (3) 

facing the passenger compartment (9), whereas in the raised position (
C
) and the operative 
position (
B
) the support brace (13) is completely disconnected from the vehicle door 
(3) and in the operative position (
B
) is connected in a force-transmitting manner at one 
end to the upper end region (22) of the windscreen column (2) and at the other end to a 

receiving means (24) arranged adjacent to the vehicle door (3) and fixed on the body. 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 in its lowered position (
A
) the 
support brace (13) extends over a substantial part of the length of the vehicle door (3), 

wherein a front end (17) of the support brace (13) is operatively connected to a sliding 
member (19) arranged inside the guide rail (18) when the vehicle door (3) is closed, and 

a rear end of the support brace (13) is detachably connected to the inner door panel (7) by 
way of a pivotable guide device (36). 
A device according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that
 the support brace (13) is 
formed by a continuous tube held detachably in position locally on the inner door panel 

(7), wherein the support brace (13) is covered in its lowered position (
A
) by a pivotable 
portion (37) of an inner door lining (10). 
A device according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that
 the support brace (13) is 
formed by a tube (40) provided with a casing (39), wherein the casing (39) is substantially 

adapted to the shape of the stepped impressed portion (16) of the inner door panel (7) 
and in part to the contour of the inner door lining (10).  

 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a locking device is provided at the 
upper end area (22) of the windscreen column (2), the support brace (13) being securely 

connected in its pivoted-up position (
C
) or the operative position (
B
) to the windscreen 
column (2) by the said locking device. 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 in the event of danger the support 
brace (13) is raised along the guide rail (18) of the windscreen column (2) by the activating 

device (12) and is pivoted upwards by the guiding device (36) situated to the rear, 
and at the same time the rear end of the support brace (13) is moved downwards into a 

receiving means (24) arranged in the region of the B-column (25) and cooperates with 
the said receiving means (24) in a supporting manner. 
A device according to Claims 1 and 6, 
characterized in that
 the receiving means (24) is 
arranged inside a cavity (26) in the B-column (25). 
A device according to Claims 1 and 6, 
characterized in that
 the receiving means (24) is 
provided on the side of the B-column (25) facing the passenger compartment (9). 
A device according to one or more of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the 
receiving means (24) comprises at least one first tube portion (28) provided with a 

funnel-shaped insertion opening (27) and receiving the end of the support brace (13) 
remote from the 
windscreen column (2) in its position (
C
), wherein a loose fit is provided 
between the first tube portion (28) and the inserted end of the support brace (13). 
A device according to one or more of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 a 
second tube portion (30) having a smaller internal diameter than the external diameter of 

the support brace (13) adjoins the first tube portion (28), as viewed in the insertion direction 
of the support brace (13), and a stop (31) for the support brace (13) is provided in 

the region of the second tube portion (30). 
A device according to one or more of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
, in the 
lowered position (
A
) of the support brace (13) and when the door (3) is closed, the support 
brace (13) acts as a door reinforcement in the event of a lateral crash. 
A device according to one or more of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 in the 
event of danger the end of the support brace (13) facing the receiving means (24) is 

moved by the activating device (12) substantially as far as a rear end (34) of the first tube 
portion (28) of the receiving means (24), and when force is applied on the windscreen  

 
column (2) from above, for example in the event of overturning, the end of the support 

brace (13) facing the receiving means (24) is moved into the second tube portion (30) 
with the absorption of energy, wherein this penetration movement is limited by the stop 

(31).
