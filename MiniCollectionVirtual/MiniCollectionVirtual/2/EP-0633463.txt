<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for measuring the colour of glass, particularly of broken glass (cullet), by measuring the transmission of the glass simultaneously in different spectral ranges, in which apparatus the glass is passed through on a conveyor (10) between a light source (18) and a receiver unit (20) having filters (84, 86) and groups (76, 78) of photoelectric detectors. One group (76, 78 respectively) of photoelectric detectors is arranged on the end, in each case of a cylindrical tube (60; 62). The axes (56, 58) of the tubes (60, 62) form an angle and intersect in the plane (88) of the conveyor (10). Between the detectors and the ends of the tubes (60, 62), filters (84, 86) having different transmission ranges and in each case an optical lens system (80, 82) are held; in this case, each optical lens system (80, 82) forms the image of the plane (88) of the conveyor (10) on the corresponding detectors.

Apparatus for measuring the colour of glass, in 
particular of scraps of waste glass, by measuring the 

transmission of the glass simultaneously in different 
spectral ranges, wherein the glass is passed, on a 

transport path (10), between a light source (18) and a 
receiver unit (20) with filters and photoelectric 

detectors (76,78),
characterized in that
(a) a group (76;78) of photoelectric detectors is 
arranged at an end face of a respective cylindrical 

tube (60;62), 
(b) the axes (56;58) of the tubes (60;62) form an angle 
and intersect in the plane (88) of the transport 

path (10), 
(c) a lens optical system (80,82) is mounted in each of 
the tubes (60;62), each lens optical system (80;82) 

imaging the plane (88) of the transport path (10) 
on an associated detector group (76;78), and 
(d) filters (84;86) having respective different 
transmission ranges are arranged in front of the 

detector groups (76;78). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the transport path (10) comprises a diffusedly-translocent 

plate (14) in the region of the receiver  
 

unit (20), the light source (18) being arranged behind 
this plate. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in 
that
 the photoelectric detectors of each group (76;78) 
are arranged out of line in two mutually staggered 

rows, which extend transversely to the direction of 
transport. 
Apparatus as claimed in anyone of the claims 1 to 3, 

characterized in that
 each receiver unit (20) consists 
of at least a pair of tubes (60,62), which are arranged 

side-by-side in transport direction of the transport 
path (10). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized in that
 
each receiver unit (20) comprises a base body (44) 

which has mutually inclined bores (52,54) on one side 
for receiving the tubes (60,62) and which is small-angled 

roof-shaped on the opposite side remote from the 
tubes with two faces (48,50) normal to the axes (56,58) 

of the tubes (60,62) and the bores (52,54), apertures 
(68,72;70,74) centered with respect to the tubes are 

provided in these faces (48,50) for accommodating the 
associated detector groups (76;78). 
Apparatus as claimed in anyone of the claims 1 to 5, 

characterized in that
 a plurality of receiver units 
(20) is arranged above a wide transport path (10) in a 

row extending transverse to the transport direction of 
the transport path.
