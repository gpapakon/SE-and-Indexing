<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for pneumatically ejecting an object from a structure, including:   - a sliding assembly (2) which comprises a body (3) associated with the said structure, and a movable member (4) mounted on the said body and bearing the said object; - pneumatic means (5) for ejecting the said object by sliding the said member from a retracted position to an emergent position; and - a controllable retention mechanism (6), locking the said object on the said member, when the latter is retracted, and releasing the said object from the said member in order to actuate the said pneumatic means.   Advantageously, the said pneumatic means (5) are integrated with the said assembly (2), in order to form therewith a leaktight chamber (7), with variable volume, between the said member (4) and the said body (3).

<CLAIMS>
Pneumatic device for ejecting an object from a
structure, of the type including:


a sliding assembly (2) which includes a body (3)
adapted to be associated with said structure and a

mobile member (4) mounted on said body and adapted to
support said object;
pneumatic means (5) for ejecting said object by sliding
of said member carrying the object from a retracted

position to a deployed position, said pneumatic ejector
means (5) being integrated into said sliding assembly

(2) to form with the latter a variable volume sealed
space (7) between said member (4) and said body (3);

and
a selectively operable retaining mechanism (6) locking
said object to said member in the retracted position of

the latter and releasing said object from said member
for the actuation of said pneumatic ejector means;

characterised in that said sealed space (7) has, in a
storage position of said device, for an initial external

pressure, a minimal volume at an internal pressure
substantially identical to said initial external pressure

and in an ejection position, for a final external
pressure less than the initial external pressure, a

maximal volume due to the action of said internal
pressure operating on said member.
Device according to claim 1,

characterised in that said sealed space (7) is delimited
by an external bellows (8) surrounding said assembly (2)

and fixed and sealed at its ends to said body and to said
member.
Device according to claim 2,

characterised in that said external bellows (8) is
metallic and that it has a zigzag section.
Device according to claim 2 or claim 3,
 
characterised in that said body (3) has a cylindrical

part (3A) along which said member (4) can slide and a
base (3B) which terminates said cylindrical part and to

which one end of said external bellows (8) is fixed and
sealed.
Device according to claim 4,

characterised in that said sliding member (4) is mounted
around said cylindrical part (3A) of said body and has a

transverse plate (4B) on which said object to be ejected
rests and to which the other end of said bellows (8) is

fixed and sealed.
Device according to claim 5,

characterised in that said plate (4B) of said member (4)
is extended by a cylindrical skirt (4A) sliding along and

sealed to the cylindrical part (3A) of said body.
Device according to claim 5,

characterised in that a sealed internal auxiliary bellows
(21) between said transverse plate (4B) of the sliding

member and said base (3B) of the body delimits the
variable volume of said sealed space (7) in conjunction

with said external bellows (8).
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that an end stop (9) for said sliding
member (4) is provided on said body (3).
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 8,

characterised in that said selectively operable retaining
mechanism (6) is accommodated in an axial passage (3F)

through said assembly (2) to lock said object to be
ejected to the sliding member of said assembly in the

retracted position.
Device according to claim 9,

characterised in that said retaining mechanism (6)
includes:


a rod (11) disposed coaxially in said passage of the
assembly and a first end of which is screwthreaded and 

carries a clamping nut (12) pressed against a back wall
of said body opposite said object to be ejected;
a coupling shaft (13) coaxially extending said rod and
to which a first end of said object is attached;
an axially split nut (14) screwed onto the
screwthreaded second end of said shaft and surrounding

the second end of said rod facing the screwthreaded end
of said shaft;
a locking ring (15) sliding around said split nut to
hold it screwed onto said shaft;
a piston (16) surrounding said ring and adapted to
slide along said axial passage, said piston being

axially coupled to said locking ring; and
a selectively operable power supply (17) which is
associated with said body and which, when it is

actuated, moves said piston and said ring axially,
which releases said split nut, separating said shaft

carrying the object from said rod.
Device according to claim 10,
characterised in that said selectively operable power

supply (17) of said retaining mechanism (6) is of the
pyrotechnic type.
