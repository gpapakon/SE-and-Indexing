<ABSTRACT>
Novel treatment process for the recovery of precious metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium and optionally other elements of value, such as rare earths and in particular cerium, which are present in various compositions, especially used or spent catalysts, for example motor vehicle exhaust catalysts, the said process being characterised in that it includes the following stages:   (i) optionally the composition to be treated is first of all brought to a finely divided state so as to increase it reactivity,   (ii) this composition is then mixed with sulphuric acid, (iii) the mixture thus obtained is then calcined between 150 DEG C and 450 DEG C, (iv) and, finally, the product thus calcined is treated in aqueous medium with, on the one hand, H
<
+
>
 ions and, on the other hand, with chloride ions, this being done simultaneously or separately, whereby there are finally obtained, on the one hand, a solid residue substantially free from precious metals and, optionally, from rare earths such as cerium, and, on the other hand, one or more solutions containing the abovementioned species.   The process offers very high recovery yields both for precious metals, in particular rhodium, and for cerium.

A process for treating a used or exhausted automobile post-combustion catalyst containing
precious metals constituted by platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, ruthenium or osmium,

used alone or as a mixture, and optionally other valuable elements represented by one or
more rare earths, to recover these species from said catalyst, characterized in that it

comprises the following steps:

(i) optionally, firstly bringing the catalyst to be treated into a finely divided form;
(ii) then mixing this catalyst with sulphuric acid;
(iii) then calcining the mixture obtained at a temperature in the range 150°C to 450°C;
(iv) and finally treating the calcined product in an aqueous medium (leaching), either
simultaneously with H
+
 ions and with chloride ions and in the presence of an
oxidising agent, or firstly with H
+
 ions then, after separating the phases, with chloride
ions in the presence of an oxidising agent, in order to finally obtain firstly a solid

residue which is substantially free of precious metals and optionally other valuable
elements, and secondly one or more solutions containing the said species.
