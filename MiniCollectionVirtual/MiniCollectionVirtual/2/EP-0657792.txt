<ABSTRACT>
The analogue electronic chronograph includes a first hand (10) making one revolution in one minute and controlled by a first control circuit (3) and a second hand (20) displaying and adding up the minutes and controlled by a second control circuit (4). When the chronograph is at a standstill, the second hand (20) continues to display the minutes whilst the first (10) is stopped in order to alert the user to the fact that the chronograph is operating and has not stopped. As a variant, it is proposed that the first hand 10 be used to add up the hours.

Electronic analogue chronograph comprising at
least a first hand (10) making one revolution in one

minute, displaying seconds (31) or fractions (30) of a
second and controlled by a first control circuit (3) and a

second hand (20) displaying and adding up minutes (33) and
controlled by a second control circuit (4), the second

hand moving forward by one minute when the first has moved
forward by sixty seconds, and push-buttons (51, 52)

capable of being actuated by the user by means of which
the chronograph may be started, frozen, stopped and reset

at zero, characterised in that means are implemented so
that, when the chronograph is frozen, at least the second

hand (20) continues to display and add up the minutes (33)
to indicate to the user that the chronograph is operating

and has not stopped.
Chronograph according to claim 1, characterised
in that the first hand (10) is stopped when the

chronograph is frozen.
Chronograph according to claim 2, characterised
in that it comprises a first second counter (1)

incremented by a time base signal (1 Hz, 5 Hz), a second
counter (3) incremented at each step of the first hand

(10), this latter being driven by a first control circuit
(3) driven by the time base signal or by a rapid frequency

signal (32.50 Hz) according to whether a switch (7) is in
a first position (60) in which the chronograph is

operating normally or in a second position (61), a
comparator (5) comparing the contents of the first (1) and

second (3) counters when the chronograph is frozen, said
comparator (5) actuating said switch (7) onto said second

position (61) when said freezing function is suppressed to 
drive the first hand (10) at accelerated speed until the

contents of the first and second counters are equal, said
first hand then displaying the time which it would have

indicated if the freezing function had not been operated,
and a second control circuit (4) for the second hand (20)

directly driven by the first counter (1) each time that
this latter has counted sixty seconds.
Chronograph according to claim 1, characterised
in that the first hand (10) moves forward by steps of a

fifth of a second when the chronograph operates normally
and by steps of a minute when it is frozen to become an

hour adding device, the angular advancement of said first
hand being the same for both functions.
Chronograph according to claim 4, characterised
in that it comprises a first fifth of a second counter (1)

incremented by a time base signal (5 Hz), a second counter
(3) incremented at each step of the first hand (10), this

latter being driven by a first control circuit (3) driven
by the time base signal (5 Hz) or by a rapid frequency

signal (32.50 Hz) according to whether a first switch (7)
is in a first position (60) in which the chronograph is

operating normally or in a second position (61), a
comparator (5) comparing the contents of the first (1) and

second (3) counters when the chronograph is frozen, said
comparator (5) actuating said first switch (7) onto said

second position when said freezing function is suppressed
to drive the first hand (10) at accelerated speed until

the contents of the first and second counters are equal,
said first hand then displaying the time which it would

have indicated if the freezing function had not been
operated, a second switch (9) allowing the first control

circuit (3) to be supplied either with the time base
signal (5 Hz) when the chronograph is operating normally,

or with a signal (54) generated by said first counter (1)
each time that the latter has counted sixty seconds when

the chronograph is frozen to make said first hand (10) an
hour adding device, and a second control circuit (4) for 

the second hand (20) directly controlled by the first
counter (1) each time that this latter has counted sixty

seconds
Chronograph according to claim 5, characterised
in that the chronograph is automatically frozen after an

integer number of minutes after being started, the first
control circuit (3) being arranged to make the first hand

(10) move forward by a number of steps equal to this
integer number as soon as said chronograph is frozen.
