<ABSTRACT>
A stretch film, in particular for packaging fresh foods, essentially comprising a linear or branched block copolymer containing from 30 to 45% by weight of a conjugated diene and from 55 to 70% by weight of a monovinylaromatic monomer, up to 10% by weight of a mineral oil, from 0.1 to 1% by weight of a wax, from 0.1 to 1% by weight of a stabiliser which is acceptable for the use, and up to 1% by weight of further auxiliaries.

<CLAIMS>
An elastomeric molding material for the
production of cling films, in particular for packaging

purposes, consisting essentially of a linear or branched
block copolymer composed of blocks of polystyrene and

polybutadiene having well defined or tapered block
transitions and comprising from 30 to 45% by weight of

butadiene and from 55 to 70% by weight of a styrene, up
to 10% by weight of a mineral oil, from 0.1 to 1% by

weight of a wax, from 0.1 to 1% by weight of a suitable
stabilizer and up to 1% by weight of further assistants.
A molding material as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the melt volume rate (200Â°C/5 kg) of the

styrene/butadiene block copolymer is from 10 to
[70 ml/10 min]
 or the average molecular weight (Mn) is
from 50,000 to 100,000 g/mol.
A molding material as claimed in claim 1,
containing 2-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-[[3-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl]
-methyl]-4-methylphenyl 2-propenoate as a stabilizer.
The use of a molding material as claimed in any
of claims 1, 2 or 3 for the production of cling films.
A cling film consisting essentially of the
molding material as claimed in any of claims 1, 2 or 3.
