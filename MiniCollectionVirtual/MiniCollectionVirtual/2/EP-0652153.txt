<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a venting device for exhaust gases of at least one missile of an arms system installed in particular on a ship. This device is constituted by a frame (1) integrated with the hull (3) of the boat and following its external shape, this frame (1) delimiting at least one orifice blocked by a cover (2), the cover (2) being ejectable under the pressure of the exhaust gases when at least one missile of the arms system is fired.

<CLAIMS>
Device for exhausting combustion gases from at least one missile in a 
weapons system, installed, for example, on board a ship, characterized in that it 

comprises a frame (1) incorporated in the hull (3) of the ship and emulating its 
external shape, this frame (1) demarcating at least one orifice plugged with a 

protective cap (2), with the protective cap (2) being ejectable under the pressure of 
the combustion gases when at least one missile in the weapons system is fired. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the protective caps (2) 
are made from a composite material and in that the structure of the frame (1) is 

made from a metal or composite material. 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that around each protective 
cap (2) or group of protective caps that have to be ejected when the missile is fired 

the frame (1) structure on its internal face which is subjected to the pressure of the 
gases has a shape that converges towards the external face. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the protective cap (2) or 
group of protective caps that have to be ejected when the missile is fired, are 

attached to the frame (1) which surround them by means of calibrated bolts (5) 
which break as soon as the pressure of the gases exceeds a pre-determined 

threshold. 
Device according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that it 
comprises, for each protective cap (2) or group of protective caps that have to be 

ejected, at least one coiled cable (11) which joins this protective cap (2) or this group 
of protective caps to the frame (1), with the cable unwinding at the moment of 

ejection. 
Device according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 
frame (1) demarcates a rectangular orifice. 
Device according to any of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the frame 
(1) demarcates four rectangular orifices arranged in 2 sets of two, one on top of the 

other.
