<ABSTRACT>
A head member (3) for picking maize provided with a 
stalk-cutter and adapted to be mounted to a combine harvester, 

comprising a cast U-shaped hollow member (1) housing means for 
transmitting motion to the operating parts of the head member 

such as a pair of squeezer rolls (5), horizontally projecting 
from the base of said U-shaped member (1), and a stalk-cutter 

roll (9) projecting downwards from an arm (11) of said U-shaped 
member, the squeezer rolls (5) being rotated through 

two bevel gears couplings (13, 15), one for each roll, wherein 
downstream said bevel gears (15) there is provided a coupling 

made up by spur-gears (17, 19) which drives a horizontal shaft 
(21) connected by means of a bevel gear pair (23) to the 

stalk-cutter roll (9); the driven gear (19) being releasable 
from the driving gear (17) by means of an eccentric (25) 

abutting against said driven gear (19) and actuated by a 
control lever (27) pivotally mounted outside the arm (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a maize picking head 
member, provided with a stalk-cutter, to be fitted 
to a combine harvester, and more in particular to an improved 
head member of this type. As it is known heads for picking up maize are formed by 
a plurality of generally U-shaped members, arranged side by 
side and connected to each other, in order to form a head 
having a desired width for picking up maize. Such heads must accomplish two operations on the maize 
stalks or stems: one is a downward pushing action and the 
second is a cutting action at the base of the stems, while 
said stems or stalks are properly lowered by suitable rolls, 
or "squeezer rolls", for shredding the stems into small pieces 
and preparing the field for the next ploughing operation. Until now the known heads have been formed by U-shaped 
members arranged side by side and provided with members for 
driving both the "squeezer rolls" and the stalk-cutter, such 
drive members usually comprising transmission chains and the 
like, receiving the motion from a suitable motor and 
transmitting said motion to the operating members. Since a relevant amount of power is required by such  
 
machines, said motion-transmission members have not always 
proved themselves as the most suitable ones, namely they often 
caused remarkable drawbacks due to jamming and/or breaking. Moreover, since it is desirable to precisely synchronize 
the motion of the squeezer rolls with that of the stalk-cutter 
blades, such kind of motion-transmission members may not be 
satisfactory in view of the basic characteristics that are 
typical of this kind of motion transmission members. An object of the present invention is to overcome said 
drawbacks, by providing a U-shaped head member for maize 
picking provided with a stalk-cutter and adapted to be mounted 
to a combine harvester and equipped with squeezer rolls of 
different design, with positive and reliable members for 
transmitting the motion and for synchronizing said motion-transmitting 
members with the operating members, in such a 
manner as to avoid the above mentioned drawbacks of the maize 
picking heads with stalk-cutter of the prior art. The head member for maize picking with a stalk-cutter 
according to the present invention comprises a 
cast U-shaped hollow member housing means for transmitting 
motion to the operating parts of the head member; said 
operating parts comprising a pair of spaced squeezer rolls, 
horizontally projecting outwards from the inner base portion 
of said U-shaped

<CLAIMS>
A head member (3) for picking maize provided with a 
stalk-cutter and adapted to be mounted to a combine harvester, 

comprising a cast U-shaped hollow member (1) housing means for 
transmitting motion to the operating parts of the head member; 

said operating parts comprising a pair of spaced squeezer 
rolls (5), horizontally projecting outwards from the inner 

base portion (7) of said U-shaped member and counter-rotating 
downwards, and a stalk-cutter roll (9) projecting downwards 

from an arm (11) of said U-shaped member, said squeezer rolls 
(5) being rotated through two couplings of bevel gears (13, 

15), one for each roll, characterized in that downstream said 
bevel gears (15) operating said squeezer rolls (5) there is 

provided an additional coupling made up by spur-gears (17, 19) 
which drives a horizontal shaft (21) connected by means of a 

bevel gear pair (23) to the stalk-cutter roll (9), and in that 
the driven gear (19) of said spur-gear pair (17, 19) is 

releasably engaged by the driving gear (17) by means of an 
eccentric (25) abutting against said driven gear (19) and 

actuated by a control lever (27) pivotally mounted on the 
outer arm (11) of the U-shaped hollow 

member (1); so that said lever (27) can 
assume one of two positions: an engagement position in which 

the eccentric (25) does not contact the driven gear (19) of 
said coupling so that the stalk-cutter (9) rotates in  

 
synchronism with the squeezer rolls (5), and a disengagement 

position in which the eccentric (25) has shifted the driven 
gear (19) so that the driving mechanism of the stalk-cutter 

(9) is uncoupled from the driving means of the squeezer rolls 
(5). 
A head member (3) for picking maize provided with a 
stalk-cutter as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the 

stalk-cutter roll (9) projecting from the arm (11) of the U-shaped 
member (1) is driven through a bevel gear pair (23) by 

a shaft (21) located inside such arm (11) and in turn rotated 
by the above mentioned pair of gearwheels (17, 19), and in 

that said stalk-cutter roll (9) is slanted to the vertical by 
an angle α from 6° to 12°, and preferably from 8° to 10°. 
A head member (3) for picking maize provided with a 
stalk-cutter as claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterized in 

that the distance (
d
) between the axis of the stalk-cutter roll 
(9) and the axis of the base of the U-shaped member (1), is 

between 320 and 240 mm, and preferably between 300 and 260 mm. 
A head member (3) for picking maize provided with a 
stalk-cutter as claimed in the preceding claims, characterized 

in that thanks to the use of bevel and spur gearwheels for the 
transmission of the motion, the body and the arms of the U-shaped 

member (1) have neither link members nor motion-transmitting 
parts projecting outwards.  

 
A head member (3) for picking maize provided with a 
stalk-cutter as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 

each U-shaped member (1) of said head (3) is provided with an 
friction clutch member (31) placed on the rear side thereof, 

said friction clutch member (31) being splined for connection to the hexagonal 
main drive shaft of the machine, and transmitting 

the motion to the operating parts of the U-shaped 
member (1) thanks to the engagement 

of said friction clutch member (31) with a splined shaft (33) 
provided on each U-shaped member (1).
