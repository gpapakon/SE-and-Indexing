<ABSTRACT>
A method of inhibiting one or more symptom of 
premenstrual syndrome/late luteal phase dysphoric disorder 

comprising administering to a female human in need of treatment 
an effective amount of a compound having the formula 


   wherein R¹ and R³ are independently hydrogen, -CH₃, 
-CO-(C₁-C₆ alkyl), or -CO-Ar, in which Ar is optionally 

substituted phenyl;
 

   R² is selected from the group consisting of 
pyrrolidino, hexamethyleneimino, and piperidino; or a 

pharmaceutically acceptable salt of solvate thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
Each month, for a few days prior to the onset of
menstruation, many millions of otherwise-healthy women develop
symptoms of disturbed mood and appetite that can be strikingly
similar to those reported by patients with Seasonal Affective
Disorder (SAD), carbohydrate-craving obesity, or the non-anorexic
variants of bulimia. This syndrome was first termed
"premenstrual tension" by R. T. Frank in 1931 and is a very
common phenomenon. According to Guy Abraham of UCLA, of every
ten patients to walk into a gynecologist's office, three or four
will suffer from premenstrual tension and, in some, the symptoms
will be of such severity as to include attempts at suicide.
Current Progress in Obstetrics and Gynecology,3:5-39 (1980).Initial descriptions of the Premenstrual Syndrome
(PMS) focused on its association with nervous tension, headache,
and weight gain. The weight gain observed was initially
attributed to excessive retention of salt and water, which does
indeed occur in some PMS patients. However, it soon became
evident that it was also a consequence of the widespread
tendency of individuals suffering from PMS to crave and
overconsume carbohydrates, particularly foods with a sweet
taste. PMS is also now referred to as late luteal phase
syndrome (or late luteal phase dysphoric disorder). D.N.S. III,
Revised, American Psychiatric Association (1987). There have been numerous suggestions made about the
etiology of PMS. For example, some hypothesized that it was
caused by a uterine toxin. Others suggested its cause was
overconsumption of sweets, which was presumably followed by
excessive insulin secretion, hypoglycemia, and inadequate brain
glucose, and resulted in the often observed depression and
anxiety. It also has been postulated that the behavioral
symptoms result from the tissue edema often observed and that
the psychological changes result from feelings of loss or the
social complexities generated by the discomforts of
menstruation.However, none of these theories has been
substantiated: PMS can persist after hysterectomy and, hence,
uterine toxins cannot be its cause; the hyperinsulinism of PMS
is not associated with low blood glucose levels, and is probably
the consequence of a behavioral aberration (i.e., the tendency
of premenstrual women to chose high-carbohydrate diets, which
potentiate insulin secretion) rather than the cause; the mood
and appetitive changes of PMS are poorly correlated with the
tissue swelling; and subhuman primates who are presumably exempt
from the psychodynamic or social
