<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a metal sheet (10) with a screw channel (16) which starts from one metal-sheet edge and runs parallel to the metal-sheet surfaces (10a, b), the screw channel (16) being formed in a simple manner in that first of all cutouts, e.g. bores (11), are introduced, and in that, thereafter, the metal-sheet parts (13) formed between the cutouts (11) are stamped alternately in the direction of one of the two metal-sheet surfaces (10a, 10b), the outer surfaces (14a, 15a) of the stamped parts being in alignment with the respective metal-sheet surface (10a, b).

<CLAIMS>
A metal plate (10) with a screw bore (16) which enters one side face of 
the metal plate and runs parallel to the plate surfaces (10a, b), characterized in that the 

screw bore (16) is formed from metal portions (13) situated between recesses (11), 
which portions are stamped alternately in the direction of the one and the other plate 

surface (10a, b) and whose outer surfaces (14a, 15a) lie flush with the relevant metal 
plate surfaces (10a, 10b). 
A method of manufacturing a metal plate (10) with a screw bore (16) as 
claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that 


a) the metal plate (10) is provided with recesses (11) from one side of the plate in 
the region of the envisaged screw bore such that metal portions (13) remain 

between the recesses (11), and 
b) the remaining metal portions (13) are alternately stamped in the direction of the 
one (10a) and of the other (10b) metal plate surface such that their outer 

surfaces (14a, 15a) lie flush with the relevant metal plate surfaces (10a, 10b). 
A method as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that the recesses are 
provided in the form of through holes (11) lying in one straight line (12), between 

which holes bridges (13) remain as the metal portions. 
A method as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in that the circular through 
holes (11) are so arranged that the centre of the first hole (11a) lies on the edge of the 

metal plate (10).
