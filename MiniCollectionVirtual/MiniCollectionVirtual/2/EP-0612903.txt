<ABSTRACT>
What is presented is a door stop for motor-vehicle doors which consists of a door-holding rod articulated pivotably by means of a bearing pedestal on one door-arrangement part, door or door spar about an axis at least approximately parallel to the door-hinge axis and of a holder housing having the door-holding rod passing through it and fastened to the other door-arrangement part and in which, for the purpose of reducing the necessary outlay in terms of construction, the door-holding rod is designed as a torsion strip and on the one hand is supported in the manner proof against tilting relative to its torsion axis in the bearing pedestal forming its pivot bearing and on the other hand is guided in the holder housing between two inflexibly mounted braking rollers.

Torsion strip door check for motor vehicle doors comprising a door hand rail 
(6) pivotably hinged by means of a pivot bracket (1) to a door assembly 

part, door (4) or door shaft (2) about an axis (5) at least approximately parallel 
to the door hinge axis (3) and a rigid handle casing (8) penetrated by the door 

hand rail and fitted onto the other door assembly part, whereby the door hand 
rail (6) is designed as a torsion strip and is supported on one side to be 

unable to turn over in relation to its torsional axis in the pivot bracket (1) 
forming its pivot bearing, characterised in that the door hand rail (6) is made 

of a single or folded flat material blank, and at right angles to its plane of 
movement is provided with brake ramps (12) rising from its longitudinal centre 

to its longitudinal edge and stop markers (13) comprised therein, and in that 
the door hand rail (6) is also guided in the handle casing (8) between two 

inflexibly mounted braking bodies (9), whereby the braking bodies (9) are 
formed by rollers or pins made of a wear-resistant material, in particular steel, 

and are mounted rotatably in the rigid handle casing (8). 
Torsion strip door check according to Claim 1, characterised in that the door 
hand rail (6) is provided with shaping in the form of braking ramps (12) rising 

from one longitudinal edge (10) to the other longitudinal edge (11) and stop 
markers (13) comprised therein. 
Torsion strip door check according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the door hand rail made from a flat material blank is provided on at least one 

of its longitudinal edges with a protuberance (36) projecting on one side to its 
plane of movement. 
Torsion strip door check according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
door hand rail made from a flat material blank at its end comprising a hinge 

eye (25) is accommodated between the two arms (26 and 27) of a two-armed 
pivot bracket (1), so that the torque resulting from the torsional load of the  

 
door hand rail (6) is supported directly against the arms (26 and 27) of the 

pivot bracket (1). 
Torsion strip door check according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the door hand rail (6) is mounted pivotably by means of a rivet bolt (29) 

on the arms (26 and 27) of the two-armed pivot bracket (1), the inner 
circumference of the hinge eye (25) optionally being lined with a ring (28) 

made of bearing material. 
Torsion strip door check according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the door hand rail (6) is connected unable to turn to a bearing 

sleeve (30) via a hinge eye bore (25) by means of positive engagement, and 
the bearing sleeve (30) is mounted on the two-armed pivot bracket (1) by 

means of a bearing pin penetrating the bearing sleeve, designed in particular 
as a rivet bolt (29). 
Torsion strip door check according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the bearing sleeve (31) mounting or supporting the door hand rail (6) on 

the bearing pin of the two-armed pivot bracket (1) is formed by an edging 

bush, whereby the edging bush (31) rests on the one hand above two edging 
shoulders (32, 33) on the door hand rail (6) without play and on the other 

hand above an end flange (34 or 35) on each of the two arms (26 or 27) of the 
pivot bracket (19). 
Torsion strip door check according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in 
that the handle casing (8) is formed by a block of material provided with 

through bores (14) for securing screws. 
Torsion strip door check according to Claim 7, characterised in that the 
handle casing (8) is designed in one piece as an injection moulded part, made 

in particular of plastic.  
 
Torsion strip door check according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in 
that the handle casing (8) is divided parallel to the through plane of the door 

hand rail (6) and comprises two injection moulded parts (20 and 21), made in 
particular of a plastic material, provided with two through bores for securing 

screws. 
Torsion strip door check according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in 
that the handle casing (8) formed from a one-piece block of material is 

secured to the corresponding door assembly part by means of a handle frame 
(16) designed as a sheet metal frame. 
Torsion strip door check according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in 
that the handle casing (8) is designed as a two-part sheet metal housing 

comprising a flat pot part (28) and an even lid part (24). 
Torsion strip door check according to one of Claims 1 to 12, characterised in 
that the door hand rail (6) has rounded longitudinal edges on at least one 

side.
