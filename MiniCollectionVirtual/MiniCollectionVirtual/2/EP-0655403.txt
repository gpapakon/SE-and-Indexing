<ABSTRACT>
In a method for stowing a load 
1
 in a load stacking position on a 
rear deck 
4A
, the load 
1
 is mounted on a slide plate 
63
 and is pushed by a pusher 

51
 to a push-in position until the load 
1
 and the slide plate 
63
 reach a load 
stacking position which is close to and facing against a front wall 
4B
 on the rear 
deck 
4A
. Then the load 
1
 is transferred to the load stacking position by pulling the 
slide plate 
63
 back from the load stacking position with the pusher 
51
 kept in the 
push-in position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for stowing
a load in a load stacking position on a rear deck.Fig. 10 shows a schematic diagram showing a conventional loading
method. In this prior art, load 1 is moved from a pallet 2 to a forklift 3 and stowed
onto a rear deck 4A of a truck 4 by the forklift 3.Fig. 11 shows a state wherein the load 1 is pushed on to the rear
deck 4A by the push-pull forklift 3 until it reaches the back thereof. A fork 3A
of the forklift 3 is placed onto the rear deck 4A, then the load 1 on the fork 3A is
pushed into the back of the rear deck 4A by a pusher 3B.The prior art, however, poses the following problems.There is a long distance between the fork 3A and the back wall of
the rear deck 4A and therefore, if the load is caught in the stepped section between
the fork 3A and the rear deck 4A while the load 1 on the fork 3A is being pushed
out by the pusher 3B, the load 1 is collapsed because there is nothing to support
the load 1 (Fig. 11B). Further, the load 1 is slid and moved by the pusher 3B,
therefore, the load 1 tends to trip from the friction generated between itself and the
rear deck 4A, and if slight unbalance takes place in the load 1, it easily falls from
being pushed by the following load 1.When pushing the load 1 onto the rear deck 4A by the pusher 3B,
the load 1 or the pusher 3B blocks the operator's view, preventing the operator
from looking at the back of the rear deck 4A and from checking whether the load
1 has fully been pushed to the back of the rear deck 4A. As a result, the operator 
may push the load 1 too much and crush it or fail to push it sufficiently, leaving
an insufficient space on the rear deck for stowing in the next load (Fig. 11C).A large working space is required for the forklift 3 to turn.US-A-4 171 178 discloses an apparatus for automatically
handling stacks of bags. An undercarriage 20 is movable on
rails 4 for being positioned in front of a stack to be loaded
or unloaded. A slide carriage 21 is movable relative to the
undercarriage 20 transversely to the rails 4. A horizontally
extending prong-shaped support member 11 is provided for
lifting a stack of bags 12 off a support surface and is movable
horizontally and vertically relative to the slide carriage 21
in order to move the removed stack to the loading surface. A
stripping plate 22 extends transversely across the prong-shaped
support member 11 and is movable horizontally so that a stack
of bags 12 can be displaced from the prong-shaped support
member 11 onto the loading

A method for stowing a load (1) in a load stacking position
on a rear deck (4A);

   characterised in that it comprises the steps of

mounting the load (1) on a slide plate (63) of a load carriage
(61) supported on a loader (35) and movable toward and

away from the loader, the load carriage (61) further comprising
a fixed base plate (62), the slide plate (63) being movable

toward and away from the base plate (62);
pushing the load with a pusher (51) to a push-in position
until the load (1) and the slide plate (63) reach a load stacking

position which is close to and facing against a front wall
on the rear deck (4A);
transferring the load (1) to the load stacking position by
pulling the slide plate (63) back from the load stacking position

with the pusher kept in the push-in position; and
the position of the base plate (62) being corrected with

regard to the position of the rear deck (4A).
The method of claim 1, further comprising the steps of:

stacking the load (1) on the rear deck side of said slide plate
(63);
positioning a leading edge of said slide plate away from said
front wall, which is said load stacking position, by the length of said

load; then
pushing in said slide plate (63) by use of said pusher (51).
The method of claim 1, further comprising the steps of:

linking said pusher (51) to said slide plate (63) to push said
slide plate (63) by said pusher to said push-in position until said load

(1) and said slide plate (63) reach said load stacking position which is
close to and facing against a front wall on said rear deck (4A); and
releasing the engagement between said pusher (51) and said
slide plate (63) before transferring said load to said load stacking

position by pulling said slide plate (63) back from said load stacking
position with said pusher (51) kept in the push-in position.
The method of claim 3, wherein said linking of said pusher
(51) to said slide plate (63) is effected after said pusher reaches to a 

position which contacts the load (1).
The method of claim 3, further comprising the steps of:

stacking said load (1) on the rear deck side of said slide plate
(63);
positioning a leading edge of said slide plate (63) away from
said front wall, which is said load stacking position by the length of

said load; then
pushing said slide plate (63) in with said pusher (51).
An apparatus for stowing a load (1) comprising:

a loader (35) which moves toward and away from a load
stacking position on a rear deck (4A);
a load carriage (61) which is provided on the loader (35)
and on which a load (1) is mounted, wherein the load carriage

is supported on the loader and is movable toward and away from
the loader; and
a pusher (51) which is provided on the loader (35) and
which pushes the load (1) on the load carriage (61) to the load

stacking position;

   characterised in that 
the load carriage (61) comprises a fixed base plate (62)
and a slide plate (63) which moves toward and away from the

base plate and which carries the load (1);
the base plate (62) is equipped with at least one roller
(64) on which the slide plate (63) is supported in such a manner

that it is free to move back and forth; and
the slide plate (63) has means (65) ensuring smooth movement
of the slide plate (63) on the rear deck (4A).
An apparatus for stowing a load according to claim 6,
wherein said slide plate (63) is equipped with a wheel (65) which rolls

on said rear deck (4A). 
An apparatus for stowing load according to claim 6,
characterized in that said pusher (51) is connectable to said slide plate

(63).
