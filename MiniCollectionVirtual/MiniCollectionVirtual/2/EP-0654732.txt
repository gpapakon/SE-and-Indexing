<ABSTRACT>
A multiplication method for a set consisting of a finite number of elements while 
enabling the four arithmetical operations including an addition, a deduction, a 

multiplication and a division and closed for the four arithmetical operations, that is, a 
Galois field, and a multiplier utilizing the multiplication method. The Galois field 

multiplication method realizes various Galois field multipliers easily by ANDing 
respective items of a multiplicand and respective corresponding one of items of a multiply 

factor in a stepwise manner, rotating left values resulted from the AND operation at a 
previous step, exclusively Oring respective values resulted from the rotation and 

respective corresponding values resulted from the And operation at a current step, and 
operating the highest item generated at the previous step in accordance with a generated 

polynomial.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of multiplication for a Galois field and
a multiplier utilizing the Galois field multiplication method, and more particularly to a
Galois field multiplication method and a multiplier utilizing the same, enabling an easy
application to various cases by virtue of a generalization of algorithm and capable of
minimizing the total number of gates used.Error may be probably generated upon storing, transmitting and receiving digital
signals. Such an error is difficult to be completely avoidable due to an effect caused by
quantizing noise and the like basically present more or less in the nature. This means that
to develop a device operable irrespective of the error is very prodigal. Consequently, a
method has been generally used, in which an error estimated more or less is detected and
corrected in accordance with a certain algorithm.In such an error detecting and correcting method, error correction codes are used.
Encoding and decoding of such error correction codes are realized on the basis of
arithmetical theories relating to Galois field.A set enabling an addition and a deduction, that is, closed for the addition and
deduction operations is generally called an "Abelian group". A set enabling a
multiplication in addition to the addition and deduction operations, that is, closed for the 
three operations including the multiplication operation is called a "ring". On the other
hand, a set enabling the four arithmetical operations including a division in addition to
the three operations, that is, closed for the four arithmetical operations is called a "field".
Such a field may be a set of rational numbers and a set of real numbers.Meanwhile, an error correction code is a set consisting of a finite number of
elements. Accordingly, such an error correction code requires a finite field which enables
the four arithmetical operations and is closed for the four arithmetical operations. Such
a finite field is generally called a "Galois field". In order to establish four arithmetical
operation among infinite elements of the Galois field and close the Galois field for the
four arithmetical operations, the four arithmetical operations for the Galois field are
defined differently from the general four arithmetical operations.In re-defining the four arithmetical operations for the Galois field, multiplication
is most important. For example, in a case of a most general Galois field which has 2N
elements (N = 1, 2, 3, .....), addition is easily calculated by exclusively ORing
