<ABSTRACT>
The use of aqueous dispersions of cationically modified polyurethanes as or for the preparation of an aqueous penetration primer for the preparation of multi-layer coatings on manually derusted steel surfaces, and a process for the preparation of a multi-layer coating on manually derusted steel structures or components, which is characterised in that a first coat consisting of an aqueous dispersion of a cationically modified polyurethane, which coat dries to form a penetration primer, is applied to the manually derusted steel surfaces, said dispersion is allowed to penetrate into the residual rust and dry, and then the coating system is completed by the application of at least one other coat.

<CLAIMS>
Use of aqueous dispersions, which dry to yield elastic 
films, of cationically modified polyurethanes having a 

content of chemically incorporated ternary or 
quaternary ammonium groups in an amount of 1 to 

120 meq of N
(+)
 per 100 g of solids and a content of 
ethylene oxide units (calculated as C
2
H
4
O) within 
terminally and/or laterally arranged polyether chains 

of 0 to 30 wt.%, relative to solids, wherein the 
stated hydrophilic structural units are present in a 

quantity at least sufficient to ensure the 
dispersibility of the polyurethanes in water, as or 

for the production of an aqueous penetrating primer 
for the production of multilayer lacquer coatings on 

manually derusted steel surfaces. 
Process for the production of a multilayer lacquer 
coating on manually derusted steel structures or 

components, characterised in that a first layer drying 
to yield a penetrating primer coat and substantially 

consisting of an aqueous, unpigmented dispersion of a 
cationically modified polyurethane is applied onto the 

manually derusted steel surfaces by brush, roller or 
spray application, is allowed to penetrate into the 

residual rust and to dry at ambient temperature and 
the coating structure is then completed by the 

application of at least one further lacquer layer onto 
the penetrating primer, wherein the polyurethane 

present in the penetrating primer contains 1 to 
120 meq of chemically incorporated ternary or 

quaternary ammonium ions N
(+)
 and 0 to 30 wt.% of 
ethylene oxide units (calculated as C
2
H
4
O) present 
within terminally and/or laterally arranged 

polyether chains, the total minimum quantity of these 
hydrophilic structural units being sufficient to 

ensure dispersibility of the polyurethane.
