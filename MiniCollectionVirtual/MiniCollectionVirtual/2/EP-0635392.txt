<ABSTRACT>
A low aerodynamic noise type current collection 
equipment is provided for reducing variation in aerodynamic 

force applied to a current collector during the train 
operation. A central region (2a) of a current collector (1) 

having a collector head (2) with a top surface in which a 
contact strip (3) is embedded is rectangular in cross-section, 

and each side region is shaped in cross-section 
convex in the front and rear directions, such as an 

elliptical shape. The rectangular shape has characteristics 

such that the magnitude of the aerodynamic lift force would 
be kept substantially constant even if the inclination angle 

against the aerial flow would be changed. Accordingly, the 
cross-sectional shape of the central region (2a) of the 

current collector (1) which is liable to receive the 
turbulent aerial flow by the support portion (4) in the 

current collector (1), whereby it is possible to suppress the 
variation in aerodynamic lift force generated in the current 

collector even if the angle of the aerial flow that would 
collide against the current collector (1) would be unstable. 

The cross-sectional shape of each side region (2b) is made 
convex in the front and rear directions such as an elliptical 

shape to thereby reduce the aerodynamic noise.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement of a low 
aerodynamic noise type current collection equipment installed 
on a train roof for a high speed operation. More 
particularly, an object of the invention is to stabilize an 
aerodynamic lift force generated in the current collection 
equipment. In the present specification, the terms of "front and 
rear" mean front and rear with respect to the advancing 
direction of the train. A current collection equipment, generally used, for 
contacting from below with contact wires installed on the 
train roof for introducing the current into the interior of 
the train is of a pantograph structure for supporting, by a 
link mechanism composed of a rhombus frame assembly, a 
current collection equipment provided on its top surface with 
contact strips contacting with the contact wires so that 
current collection equipment is movable up and down. However, 
the pantograph type current collection equipment suffers from 
a problem such that, in the case where the operation velocity 
exceeds 200km/h, the generated aerodynamic noise level is  
 
increased to cause noises along the rail way. Accordingly, instead of the above-described pantograph, 
Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open No. 5-25902 
(Japanese patent Application No. 3-80695) shows a low 
aerodynamic noise type current collection equipment 100 
(hereinafter referred to as a "conventional equipment" 
composed of a current collector 110 having an elliptical 
shape or an aerodynamic shape in cross-section and a post-like 
support portion 120 for supporting the current collector 
110 as shown in Fig. 21. Incidentally, Fig. 21 shows an outer 
appearance of the conventional equipment 100 on the basis of 
the above-described application. The current collector 110 of the conventional equipment 
100 is composed of a contact strip 130 in contact with 
contact wires and a collector head 111 with the contact strip 
130 being buried on a top surface thereof. Each horn portion 
112 which is tapered toward each end of the collector head 
111 is integrally formed with the collector head 111. A side 
elevational sectional shape of the collector head 111 is 
formed of a smooth continuous, elliptical or aerodynamic 
shaped surface as a whole. Incidentally, the contact strip 
130 mounted so as to be finely elastically movable up and 
down by springs 140 or the like. In a normal condition, the 
contact strip 130 is set so as to be flush with a top surface 
of the collector head 111 or somewhat project from the top
