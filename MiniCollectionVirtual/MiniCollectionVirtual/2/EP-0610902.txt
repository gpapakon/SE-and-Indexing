<ABSTRACT>
An anti-theft device for a motor vehicle wherein a personal 
identification unit (T) is carried by an authorized operator 

of said motor vehicle and includes means for identifying 
its location in the vicinity of the motor vehicle. A vehicle 

control unit (10) mounted onto the motor vehicle, has a first 
and second condition with means for allowing operation of 

the motor vehicle when the control unit is in the first 
condition and means for inhibiting operation of the motor 

vehicle when said control unit is in the second condition 
and means for shifting the cont
rol unit into the second condition 
at a time subsequent to removal of the identification 

device (T) from the vicinity of the motor vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the art of anti-theft
devices - especially for motor vehicles and more particularly
to a device which will thwart attempts by criminal elements
to forcibly commandeer a vehicle from an authorized
operator.The invention has particular application to preventing
the escalating incidences of physical commandeering of motor
vehicles occurring primarily in urban areas and it will be
described with particular reference thereto; however, the
invention has broader applications and is extremely effective
in preventing theft of a vehicle after it has been
parked by an authorized operator. Also the invention allows
programmed operation of accessories associated with the vehicle
upon approach and retreat of the authorized operator
of the motor vehicle or when the vehicle is parked and unattended.
Consequently, it is appreciated that the invention
has these broader applications even though particular emphasis
is applied to its primary goal of hampering or thwarting
commandeering of motor vehicles.There are a tremendous number of anti-theft devices for
motor vehicles, many of which are now on the market. In addition,
many motor vehicles are provided from the factory
with integrated security or theft prevention systems. After
a vehicle has been purchased, professional persons can be
employed for applying sophisticated security systems or anti-theft
devices on the motor vehicle. Such complicated
systems are extremely expensive and can be installed only by
the most talented persons and are not suitable for "Do It
Yourself" vehicle owners, a group of persons that substantially
outnumber those who can afford professionally installed,
or factory installed, security devices. Relatively
inexpensive, easily installed security devices are generally
simplistic in operation and merely prevent theft of a vehicle,
while the vehicle is unattended. In these devices,
when an authorized operator enters the vehicle, the security 
device is deactivated by some unspecified act. Indeed, this situation is
normally true of factory installed and professional installed security systems.
Consequently, security systems of both the inexpensive type
and the professionally installed type do not, in any way, protect from or
hamper a hijacking situation where a criminal element physically ejects
an authorized operator and steals the motor vehicle. Thus, there is a
substantial need for a device which will prevent or indeed in some way
hamper, thwart or discourage hijacking of motor vehicles. Such a device
would not
