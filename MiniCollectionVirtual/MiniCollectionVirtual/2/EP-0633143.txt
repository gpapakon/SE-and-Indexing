<ABSTRACT>
Color images with high fixation comparable to that 
of silver salt photographic images are formed on printing 

papers, using aqueous ink compositions by ink jet 
recording. Color images thus formed have high saturation 

and high resolution. An intercalated compound capable of 
fixing water-soluble dyes to a printing paper due to the 

intercalation based on ion-exchanging between them is 
incorporated into the dye-receiving layer 2 of the paper, 

on which color images are formed by ink jet recording 
using an aqueous ink composition containing a water-soluble 

dye. The content of the intercalated compound in 
the layer 2 is from 10 to 90 % by weight. As the 

intercalated compound, montmorillonoids are preferred when 
water-soluble cationic dyes are used while hydrotalcite-group 

minerals are preferred when water-soluble anionic 
dyes are used. Fig. 1 is selected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printing paper
and a printing sheet both capable of
forming a color image with excellent
fixability, using an aqueous ink composition containing a
water-soluble dye
and, in particular, to a printing paper
and printing sheet
suitable for ink
jet recording. It also relates to a composition for
forming a dye-receiving layer for such a printing paper and printing sheet.As one means for fixing an image information
prepared by the use of a personal computer, etc. on a
printing paper in the same manner as in silver salt
photography, a method of forming a color image on a
printing paper according to an ink jet recording system
using an aqueous ink composition is considered hopeful.In such an ink jet recording system, a liquid,
aqueous ink composition containing a water-soluble dye,
water, a polyalcohol, etc. is jetted out and adhered onto
a printing paper having a dye-receiving layer at the dye-receiving
layer through nozzles, using a driving power 
such as electric field, heat and pressure to thereby form
an image thereon.The water-soluble dye to be employed in the
aqueous ink composition for such an ink jet recording
system is essentially a water-soluble direct dye or acidic
dye (hereinafter referred to as "anionic dye") having a
sufficient fixability to cellulose constituting paper
which is essentially used as a recording medium and
capable of yielding a black color by itself.On the other hand, the ink-receiving surface of
the printing paper to be used in the ink jet recording
system using such an aqueous ink composition has a dye-receiving
layer composed of various additives dispersed in
a water-soluble high polymer having a high affinity for
dyes so as to prevent the aqueous ink composition applied
thereto from bleeding.Conventional water-soluble anionic dyes used in
the ink jet recording system are, after having been
transferred to the dye-receiving layer, captured in the 
dye-receiving layer due to the interactions such as van
der Waals force and hydrogen bonding between them and the
constituent components in the dye-receiving layer,
according to the theory of dyeing. Therefore, after
formation of images, when other substances such as
solvents or resins having a higher affinity for these dyes
are brought into contact with the formed images or when
some heat energy enough to cancel these interactions is
applied thereto, then the dyes will dissolve out or
transfer from the dye-receiving layer to such other
substances whereby the thus-formed images will be blurred
without
