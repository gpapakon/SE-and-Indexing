<ABSTRACT>
The storage silo has a frustoconical discharge 
chute terminating in an annular outlet member having 

an inflatable bladder about its margin. A gate is 
movable horizontally and, when in the vicinity of the 

opening near its closing position, movable both 
horizontally and vertically into engagement with the 

margin of the cylindrical wall member. The bladder 
is then inflated to engage the gate sealing between 

the outlet and the gate. To open the outlet, the 
bladder is deflated to a location above the margins 

of the opening whereby the gate may be moved 
vertically downwardly and horizontally away from the 

opening to discharge material from the silo.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
gate and a seal for the gate about the outlet of a 
material storage container and particularly relates 
to a gate seal for selectively opening and closing 
the outlet of an asphalt storage silo. Storage silos are frequently used for storing 
various types of materials. Typically, such silos 
have conveyors for conveying the material from ground 
level to adjacent the top of the silo and depositing 
the material in the silo. An outlet is disposed 
adjacent the bottom of the silo and which outlet is 
typically situated above a drive-through material 
transfer station. Thus, material from the silo may 
be discharged through the outlet directly into a 
truck or other conveyance. As a specific example, 
storage silos are frequently used as surge containers 
for storing asphalt mix in the asphalt paving 
industry. Frequently, because of weather or other 
conditions, hot asphalt mix must be stored for later 
use. As a condition for storing the hot asphalt mix, 
the mix must be maintained at an elevated temperature 
in order to preclude the mix from setting up. 
Additionally, the mix must be stored in a sealed 
container to avoid oxidation which causes 
deterioration of the asphalt mix. One of the  
 
particular problems associated with storing hot 
asphalt mix is to provide an effective seal about the 
outlet opening of the silo. One currently used seal for this purpose 
comprises a pair of concentric cylinders against 
which a gate is driven with a trolley system and 
wedges. The gate is closed about the silo outlet and 
grease is pumped into the annulus between the 
cylinders. While this system has worked 
satisfactorily, it is necessary for the gate to drive 
hard against the cylinders and to maintain the cavity 
between the cylinders clear so that the grease can 
fill the cavity. Unfortunately, debris becomes 
packed in this area, preventing the formation of a 
tight seal between the gate and the cylinders and 
oftentimes precluding the grease from filling the 
cavity to make the seal. Other sealing systems for asphalt mixes are also 
known. For example, fluid seals, such as illustrated 
in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,532,252 and 4,284,203 have 
been used. Also, an inflatable seal has been used, 
for example, as illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 
3,820,687. In that patent, the sliding action is 
strictly horizontal, causing the seal to abrade and 
generally wear. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a gate and seal for a storage container  
 
which
