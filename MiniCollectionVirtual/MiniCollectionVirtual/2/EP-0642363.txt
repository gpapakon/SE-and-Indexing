<ABSTRACT>
Provided are orthopedic fasteners and replacements such as nails, screws, pins, hip and knee replacements, etc., coated with hydrogels and other biocompatible/biodegradable materials which expand in the presence of liquids. Swelling of such coatings causes the fastener or replacement to be securely fixed into position once inserted into bone material. Useful coating materials include methacrylates, hyaluronic acid esters, and crosslinked esters of hyaluronic acid resulting from the esterification of hyaluronic acid with polyhydric alcohols. Also provided is a method for fixing a bone or bone replacement in position employing such coated orthopedic fasteners or replacements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the coating of
orthopedic replacements such as intramedullary nails,
screws, hip replacements, etc., with hydrogels or other
biocompatible/biodegradable materials which expand in
the presence of liquids. Said hydrogel or other
biocompatible, biodegradable material is a member
selected from the group consisting of
polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate, a semi-interpenetrating
polymer network composed of crosslinked poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate)
and poly(caprolactone), a
copolymer of 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate and
methylmethacrylate, poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate), a
hyaluronic acid (HY) ester, and a crosslinked ester of
hyaluronic acid resulting from the esterification of
hyaluronic acid with polyhydric alcohols.
Expansion of the outer coating
causes the replacement to be fixed into position once
inserted into the intramedullary bone cavity. The same
principle applies in the case of similarly coated screws
and nails, which are thus able to maintain their
mechanical hold where they are inserted in intracortical 
holes, and improve the function of normal spiral screws.
Coating can be done by direct polymerization of the
monomer by immersion in the case of coatings made with
linear polymers. The degree of pressure exercised after
expansion is controlled by the degree of cross-linking
of the polymeric network, by the thickness of the
coating, and by the presence of organic or inorganic
inclusions in the coating. Current treatments for bone fractures involve the
use of stiff plates which lend mechanical support to the
join until the tissues have had time to heal. The plates
are fixed to the bone by spiral screws screwed into the
bone itself (Amis et al.: Fatigue fracture of a femoral
sliding compression screw-plate device after bone union.
Biomaterials, Vol. 8, 1987). As the plate is stiffer
than the bone, it bears most of the strain inflicted on
them, whereby the bone is actually protected from any
strain. This protection results in anomalous regrowth of
the natural tissue and prevents the early mending of the
bone parts because of the formation of callus during the
process of reconnection (Szivek et al.: A study of bone
remodelling using metal-polymer laminates. J. of
Biomedical Materials Research, Vol. 15, 853-865, 1981).
Over time, the extreme stiffness of the plate can cause
atrophy and osteoporosis.Another problem arises from the type of fastener
used to fix the plate to the bone. These are usually
metal screws driven directly into the bone, and often
cause local trauma by
