<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed generally to a
strong metal complexing resin for ion exchange
columns. More particularly, the invention is related
to an ion exchange resin prepared by copolymerizing
diphosphonic acid groups with acrylonitrile, styrene
and/or divinylbenzene to form a polymeric resin for
preferentially removing heavy metal contaminants in a
highly acidic solution.A variety of far reaching environmental
protection statutes and regulations have significantly
increased the need for effective and efficient means
for removal of a wide spectrum of metal contaminants
from aqueous based wastes or contaminated waterways.
In addition, specific industries, such as the nuclear
industry and electroplating industry, generate
substantial quantities of water based effluent which
are heavily contaminated with undesirable metal ions.
The removal of metal ion contaminates from waste
streams is often made difficult due to the strongly
acidic nature of the waste effluent. Under such
acidic conditions prior art metal complexing resins
perform poorly to remove or recover such metals or
have selectivity for only a very few types of metal
ions. While phosphonic acids have been known to have
the ability to complex with metal ions generally,
there has been no demonstrated ability to allow
selective removal of the chelated metal ions which is
essential for selectivity of metal ion type as well as
removal from the ion exchange resin.It is therefore an object of the invention to
provide an improved metal complexing resin for ion
exchange columns. It is also an object of the invention to provide
a novel metal complexing resin and method of
manufacture from copolymerization of diphosphonic acid
groups with acrylonitrile, styrene and/or
divinylbenzene.It is an additional object of the invention to
provide an improved method of preferentially removing
toxic metal ions relative to alkaline and alkaline
earth ions from strongly acidic water based wastes.It is a further object of the invention to
provide a novel product and method of manufacture of a
sulfonated copolymer of diphosphonic acid group with
acrylnitrile and styrene and/or divinylbenzene.It is another object of the invention to provide
an improved method of manufacturing a desired end
product resin of narrow size distribution and uniform
shape.It is yet an additional object of the invention
to provide a novel variety of copolymerization
procedures involving copolymerizing vinylidene
diphosphonic ester, a R2C=CR2 group where R is a
combination of electron
