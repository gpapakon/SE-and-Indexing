<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a filter for a gas 
producer includes the steps of forming a wire (73) 

having wavy curvature into an annular laminate by 
supplying the wire into a space of a die assembly (7) 

and compressing it to form a filter. In supplying the 
wire into the die assembly, the wire may be wound about 

a rotating body (54) to obtain an annular body (74). 
In compressing the body (74) it is compressed halfway 

to obtain a first shaped product (75) and wires 
separately prepared as binding wires (76) are wound 

around sections of the first shaped product which is 
then finally compressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of producing 
a filter for a gas producer such as is used for 
expanding a bag for producing floating force and an air 
bag for protecting a personnel when collision of a 
vehicle, closing or opening a valve in emergency, 
injecting a gas into a seat in emergency and the like. Systems using high temperature gases produced by 
igniting a gunpowder have been widely used as gas 
producers. In this case, filters are needed for 
cooling the gases and collecting harmful components in 
the gases in order to avoid damage of bags and the 
like. Reference should be made to European prior 
application no. 89312018.8 (publication no. 0370734) 
from which the present application is divided, for a 
description of the prior art and of filters which can 
be used by the method of the present invention. It is an object of the invention to provide a 
method of producing a filter for a gas producer, for 
example a filter as set out in the application 
89312018.8. Reference B also made to EP-A-0 012 627 which shows 
woven screens placed over a pressed wire filter at the gas 
inlet and exit sides, to avoid loosening of the wires.  
 The method of the present invention is set out 
in claim 1. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the 
wire or wires having wavy curvature are wound about a 
rotating column body to obtain an annular laminate  
 
which is supplied into an annular space in a die 
assembly to be compressed. In this invention, various heat-resistant steel 
wires can be used, for example, stainless, nickel 
alloy, cobalt alloy steel wires and the like. If a 
wire diameter of the steel wire is less than 0.1 mm, 
there is a risk of melting down. On the other hand, if 
it is more than 1.5 mm, it becomes difficult to form 
the wire into a curved wire because of increased 
resistance to be deformed and a filter made of the wire 
includes excessive clearances resulting in poor cooling 
effect for gases passing therethrough and poor 
collection effect of harmful compositions. The heat-resistant steel wire may be a usual 
long wire made by drawing it through a drawing die. 
Moreover, a short wire of the order of 50-300 mm made 
according to a method called as "melt extraction 
method" is inexpensive and preferable. In the melt 
extraction method, a rotating water-cooled disc is 
brought into contact with a surface of a molten steel 
so as to pick up a small amount of the molten steel to 
form fine fiber-like wires accumulated on a lateral 
side. In this invention, a heat-resistant

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing a filter for a gas producer 
comprising the steps of forming at least one wire 

(22,73) of wire diameter in the range of 0.1-1.5 mm 
having wavy curvature into an annular body (8), and 

compressing the body, characterised by the step of 
binding wires (25,76) around the annular body (8) so 

that the binding wires extend over both the inside and 
outside peripheral faces of the body as well as the top 

and bottom faces thereof, and thereafter performing a 
compressing step on the body.  

 
A method according to claim 1 wherein in 
compressing the body, it is compressed partially to 

obtain a first shaped product (24,75), thereafter the 
binding wires (25,76) are wound around regions of the 

first shaped product, and the first shaped product is 
then further compressed to obtain the filter. 
A method as set forth in claim 1 or claim 2 
wherein the or each said wire has a length of at least 

50 mm. 
A method as set forth in any one of claims 1 to 
3 wherein the wire or wires having wavy curvature are 

obtained by a process including passing a wire between 
gears (2,72) in mesh with each other with clearances 

between them. 
A method as set forth in any one of claims 1 to 
4 wherein the wire or wires having wavy curvatures are 

supplied into an annular space in a die assembly (7) to 
form a body (8) to be compressed. 
A method as set forth in any one of claims 1 to 
4 wherein the wire or wires having wavy curvature are  

 
wound about a rotating mandrel (54) to obtain an 

annular body which is supplied into an annular space in 
a die assembly (7) to be compressed.
