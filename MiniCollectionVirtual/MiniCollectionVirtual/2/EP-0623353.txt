<ABSTRACT>
The device for high-pressure sterilisation of products comprises a leaktight enclosure (1) formed by a bottom (10), pierced with an orifice (12) connected to pressurised fluid supply means, and by a cover (20) which is assembled with the said bottom (10) by means of a fastening member (2), and a sliding piston (30) mounted in a leaktight manner in the enclosure (1) and intended to move in the said enclosure (1) under the effect of the pressure exerted by the fluid on an active surface (31) of the sliding piston (30). The device also comprises a high-pressure treatment chamber (5) made in the sliding piston (30) and intended to receive the product to be sterilised, and a fixed piston (40), solidly attached to the lid (20) and intended to penetrate into the high-pressure treatment chamber (5) when the sliding piston (30) is moved, in order to compress the said product to be sterilised.

Device for the high-pressure sterilisation of
products, comprising a fluid-tight enclosure (1) formed

from a base (10) pierced with an orifice (12) connected to
means of feeding with pressurised fluid and a cover (20)

assembled with the said base by means of an attachment
device (2) and a sliding piston (30) fitted in a fluid-tight

manner in the enclosure (1) and intended to move
inside the said enclosure (1) under the effect of the

pressure applied by the fluid on an active surface (31) of
the said sliding piston (30), characterised in that it

comprises a high-pressure processing chamber (5) formed in
the sliding piston (30) and intended to receive the product

to be sterilised and a fixed piston (40) integral with the
cover (20) intended to penetrate into the high pressure

processing chamber (5) during the displacement of the
sliding piston (30) in order to compress the said product

to be sterilised, the free end of the fixed piston (40)
determining a second active surface (41), the ratio between

the active surfaces (31, 41) of the sliding piston (30) and
of the fixed piston (40) being 1 to 20.
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the sliding piston (30) is formed from at least two shells

(32, 33) and an inner protective liner (34), the said
shells (32, 33) and the said inner liner (34) being

concentric and integral with one another.
Device according to Claim 2, characterised in that
the sliding piston (30) is formed from an outer shell (32),

an intermediate shell and in inner protective liner (34),
the said shells (32, 33) and the said inner liner (34)

being concentric and integral with one another.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the outer shell (32) comprises a 

blind bore (32a) inside of which the intermediate shell
(33) is fitted.
Device according to Claim 4, characterised in that
the intermediate shell (33) is fitted inside the outer

shell by shrink-fitting.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the intermediate shell (33) comprises

a blind bore (33a) which is concentric with the blind bore
(32a) of the outer shell (32) and inside of which the inner

liner (34) is fitted.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the inner liner (34) comprises a

blind bore (34a) forming the high-pressure processing
chamber (5) and which is concentric with the blind bores

(32a, 33a) of the outer shell (32) and of the intermediate
shell (33).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the outer shell (32) comprises on its

outer surface a seal (36) intended to co-operate with the
inside surface of the base (10) in order to ensure fluid-tightness

between, on the one hand, a chamber (4) delimited
by the active surface (31) of the sliding piston (30) and

the base (10) and, on the other hand, the enclosure (1).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the fixed piston (40) comprises on

its outer surface a seal (42) intended to co-operate with
the inside surface of the inner liner (34) in order to

ensure fluid-tightness between, on the one hand, the high-pressure
processing chamber (5) and, on the other hand, the

enclosure (1).
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
it comprises a jack (50) for returning the sliding piston

(30). 
Device according to Claim 10, characterised in
that the jack (50) comprises a rod (53) traversing the

base (10) in a fluid-tight manner and connected to the
outer shell (32) of the sliding piston (30).
Device according to Claim 10 and 11, characterised
in that the rod (53) of the jack (50) is connected to means

of marking the position of the sliding piston (30) in the
enclosure (1).
