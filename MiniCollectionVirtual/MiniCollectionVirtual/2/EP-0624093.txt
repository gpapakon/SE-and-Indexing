<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE: THE USE OF A COMPOUND FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF AMEDICAMENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF HIV INFECTION DESCRIPTIONThe present invention relates to the use of a compound for the manufacture of medicament for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.Infection by HIV, of which there are two distinct types HIV-1 and HIV-2, leads to the development of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)1,2. Several compounds which interfere with the replication of the virus have been developed for the treatment of AIDS, however only one compound, AZT (Azidothymidine) , has been widely used in the treatment of HIV infection.Although AZT is a highly effective drug in blocking HIV replication, it has two major drawbacks. Firstly, it is frequently toxic inhibiting not only HIV replication but also the division of bone marrow cells causing anaemia, leukopenia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia 3'4. Secondly, within six months of prolonged treatment, AZT-resistant mutants of HIV appear 5.Thus, there is an urgent need to find drugs that will interfere with HIV replication without overt cytotoxicity. It is known that HIV replication depends on T-cell activation and proliferation.The aim of the present invention is to develop an agent which inhibits HIV replication. It was thought that if T-cell activation could be suppressed, HIV replication would be inhibited. 

 This aim is achieved by affecting the signal transduction pathway for T-cell activation by administering calcineurin-antagonists and/or rotamase-antagonists and/or NF-AT-antagonists.Accordingly the present invention provides the use of calcineurin-antagonists for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of HIV infection.In another aspect, the present invention provides the use of rotamase-antagonists for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of HIV infection.In a further aspect, the present invention provides the use of NF-AT-antagonists for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of HIV infection.Suitable for use according to the present invention are compounds that act as calcineurin-antagonists, rotamase-antagonists or NF-AT-antagonists , for exampleCyclosporin A (Cyclo {-[4-(E)-but-2-enyl-N, 4-dimethyl-L- threon l ]-L-homoalanyl-(N-methylglycyl)- (N-methy1-L- leucy1)-L-valy1-( -methy1-L-leucyl)-L-alanyl-D-alany1-(N- methyl-L-leucyl)-(N-methy1-L-leucyl)-(N-meth 1-L-valyl) } )FK506 (16-Allyl-1, 14-dihydroxy-12-[2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy- cyclohexyl)-1-methylvinyl]-23,25-dimethoxy-l3,19,21,27- tetramethyl-11 ,
