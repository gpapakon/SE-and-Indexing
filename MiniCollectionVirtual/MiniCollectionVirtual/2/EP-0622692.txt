<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an automatic document conveying 
device suitable for use in an image forming apparatus. 

The conveying device comprises a main portion (14) 
mounted for movement between a closed position to cover a 

transparent plate (8) and an open position which exposes 
the transparent plate (8). A conveyor belt mechanism comprises 

a driven roller (76) and a follower roller (78) as 
well as a plurality of pressing rollers (80, 82, 84, 86) 

disposed therebetween. The pressing rollers are adapted for 
vertical movement and are downwardly urged to press the 

lower portion of an endless belt (88) onto the transparent 
plate (8). At least one (84, 86) of the pressing rollers 

has a diameter greater than the diameter of the driven roller 
(76) and the follower roller (78) in order to prevent 

the upper portion of the endless belt (88) from slackening 
in the downward direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic document conveying 
device adapted to an image processor such as an 
electrostatic copying machine or an image reader. It is widely accepted practice to provide image processing 
machines such as electrostatic copying machines and image 
readers with an automatic document conveying device in order 
to automatically handle the documents in the image 
copying operation or in the image reading operation. Prior 
literature disclosing automatic document conveying devices 
can be represented by Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication 
Nos. 91747/1978 and 118551/1985, and Japanese Utility Model 
Laid-Open Publication No. 49348/1986. The image processing machine such as the electrostatic 
copying machine or the image reader has a housing, and on 
the upper surface of the housing is disposed a transparent 
plate on which will be placed a document that is to be processed. 
The automatic document conveying device is usually 
equipped with a document introduction portion, a main portion 
and a document delivery portion. The document introduction 
portion includes an introduction portion frame member 
disposed on the upstream side of the transparent plate 
and a document table that extends toward the upstream side 
from the introduction portion frame member. In the introduction 
portion frame member is formed a document introduction 
passage that extends from the document table toward 
the transparent plate. A plurality of pieces of documents 
placed on the document table are sent onto the document introduction 
passage piece by piece by the operation of document  
 
sending means, and are carried onto the transparent 
plate through the document introduction passage by the 
operation of document introduction means. The main portion 
of the automatic document conveying device includes a movable 
main portion frame member that is mounted to pivot 
between a closed position to cover the transparent plate 
and an open position to bring the transparent plate exposed 
to view, and document conveying means which conveys the 
document along the transparent plate when the movable main 
portion frame member is at the closed position. The document 
conveying means is usually constituted by a conveyer 
belt mechanism mounted on the movable main portion frame 
member. The document delivery portion includes a delivery 
portion frame member disposed on the downstream side of the 
transparent plate. In the delivery portion frame member is 
formed a document delivery passage. Further, a

<CLAIMS>
An automatic document conveying device to be applied 
to an image processor that has a transparent plate (8) 

disposed on the upper surface of a housing (6) so that 
a document to be processed is placed thereon, comprising: 


a main portion (14) including a movable main portion 
frame member (70) that is mounted to move between a 

closed position to cover said transparent plate (8) 
and an open position to expose said transparent plate 

(8) into view, and a document conveying means (74) 
mounted on said main portion frame member (70) to convey 

the document along said transparent plate (8) when 
said main portion frame member (70) is located at said 

closed position; wherein 
said main portion frame member (70) is constituted by 
a support base member (216) and a cover member (218), 

said document conveying means (74) is constituted by a 
conveyer belt mechanism mounted on said support base 

member (216), and said cover member (218) covers said 
conveyer belt mechanism; wherein 
said conveyer belt mechanism includes a driven roller 
(76) and a follower roller (78) disposed maintaining a 

distance in the document conveying direction, a plurality 
of pressing rollers (80, 82, 84, 86) disposed 

between said driven roller (76) and said follower roller 
(78) maintaining a distance in the document conveying 

direction, and an endless belt (88) wound round 
said driven roller (76), said follower roller (78) and 

said plurality of pressing rollers (80, 82, 84, 86), 
wherein said plurality of pressing rollers are so  

 
mounted as to move over a predetermined range in the 

up-and-down direction and are downwardly urged in 
order to press the lower running portion of said endless 

belt (88) onto said transparent plate (8) when 
said main portion frame member (70) is located at said 

closed position; and 
said support base member (216) of said main portion 
frame member (70) extends between the upper running 

portion and the lower running portion of said endless 
belt (88), and at least one (84, 86) of said plurality 

of pressing rollers (80, 82, 84, 86) has a diameter 
greater by more than a predetermined amount than the 

diameter of said driven roller (76) and said follower 
roller (78), in order to prevent the upper running 

portion of said endless belt (88) from downwardly 
slackening to come in contact with said support base 

member (216). 
The automatic document conveying device according to 
claim 1, wherein a pressing roller (84, 86) disposed 

in a central region between said driven roller (76) 
and said follower roller (78) has a diameter greater 

by more than a predetermined amount than the diameter 
of said driven roller (76) and said follower roller 

(78). 
The automatic document conveying device according to 
cl
aim 1 or 2, wherein said conveyer belt mechanism 
includes a front-side support means (292) and a rear-side 

support means (294) which are mounted on said 
support base member (216) of said main portion frame 

member (70) maintaining a distance in the direction of 
width, and said driven roller, said follower roller 

and said pressing rollers (80, 82, 84, 86) are mounted  
 

between said front-side support means (292) and said 
rear-side support means (294).
