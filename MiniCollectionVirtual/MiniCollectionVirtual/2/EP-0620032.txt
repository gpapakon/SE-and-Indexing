<ABSTRACT>
A doll includes a generally semi-ellipsoidal shell 
(10) within its stomach region which defines a recess 

accommodating one or more replica babies. The recess is 
closed by a removable cover (16). Within the body of the 

doll are voice synthesising means (26, 34) arranged to 
produce the sound of a crying newborn baby and a switch 

(40) connected to control the operation of the voice 
synthesising means. The switch, which may constitute a 

photosensitive element (40), is so arranged that the 
voice synthesising means is switched on when the cover 

(16) is removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to dolls as are used 
as a child's plaything and is concerned with that type of 
doll in whose stomach region there is a recess which 
accommodates one or more replica babies, the recess being 
closed by a removable cover. Dolls of this type, so-called pregnant dolls, are 
known (see for instance document WO 90/00921). 
They afford much entertainment to young children, 
particularly young girls. Dolls are also known, so-called crying dolls, which 
include a voice synthesiser or voice unit which is 
arranged to produce a noise which approximates to that of 
crying. The voice unit is intended to produce the 
illusion that the doll is crying. Dolls are usually in 
the form of a young child or relatively old baby and the 
crying noise which is produced is thus that of a crying 
child or relatively old baby. The voice unit of such 
dolls is actuated by a simple manual switch, for instance 
by moving or removing a part of the doll, e.g. a "dummy" 
in its mouth. It is the objection of the invention to develop and 
improve so-called pregnant dolls so that they provide 
greater entertainment, and enhanced possibilities for 
play, to children. According to the present invention a doll of the 
type referred to above is characterised by voice 
synthesising means arranged to produce the sound of a 
crying baby and switch means connected to control the 
operation of the voice synthesising means, the switch 
means being so arranged that the voice synthesising means 
is switched on when the cover is removed. Thus the doll of the present invention not only  
 
contains one or more replica babies in a recess or cavity 
within its stomach region which is closed by a removable 
cover but also includes a voice synthesiser arranged to 
produce the sound of a crying newborn baby when the cover 
is removed. This creates the illusion that the replica 
babies within the recess cry when exposed to light and it 
is thus the replica babies which are perceived to be 
crying rather than the doll itself. The switch controlling the operation of the voice 
synthesising means may take various forms and may, for 
instance, simply be a pressure-actuated switch which is 
actuated by the removal of the cover. Alternatively, the 
cover may include a conductive wire or area which 
completes a circuit connected to the voice synthesising 
means when it is in position, which circuit is broken 
when the cover is removed and thus initiates operation of 
the voice synthesising means. It will therefore be 
appreciated

<CLAIMS>
A doll in whose stomach region there is means 
defining a recess which accommodates one or more replica 

babies (24), the recess being closed by a removable cover 
characterised by voice synthesising means (26, 34) 

arranged to produce the sound of a crying baby and switch 
means (40) connected to control the operation of the 

voice synthesising means, the switch means being so 
arranged that the voice synthesising means is switched on 

when the cover (16) is removed. 
A doll as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in 
that the recess is defined by a shell (10) in which an 

aperture (42) is formed, that the switch means comprises 
a photosensitive element (40) positioned behind the 

aperture (42) so that light is incident on it when the 
cover (16) is removed and that the photosensitive element 

(42) and the voice synthesising means (26, 34) are so 
constructed that when light is incident on the 

photosensitive element it switches the voice synthesising 
means (26, 34) on. 
A doll as claimed in Claim 1 or 2 characterised 
in that the means (10) defining the recess is pivotally 

mounted in the stomach region of the doll to be movable 
between a position in which the said means (10) is 

visible from the exterior of the doll and the cover (16) 
is not and a position in which the cover (16) is visible 

from the exterior of the doll and the said means is not. 
A doll as claimed in Claim 3 characterised in 
that the means (10) defining the recess projects further 

from the pivotal axis (12) than does the cover (16).
