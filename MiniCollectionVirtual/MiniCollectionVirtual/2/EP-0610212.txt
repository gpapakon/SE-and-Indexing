<ABSTRACT>
Hybridization buffers, for hybridizing complementary polynucleotides, contain polyvinyl alcohol (MW 1000-20000) and/or polystyrene sulphonic acid (e.g. MW 60000 - 80000) as a rate enhancer, generally at a concentration of 1 - 10 %. Dextran sulphate, polyethylene glycol and cationic detergents may be additionally present. The method is useful when one of the two complementary polynucleotides is immobilised, or is in in situ hybridizations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns the 
hybridization between two complementary polynucleotide 
segments, and relates in particular to agents for 
increasing the rate of hybridization and total amount 
of hybrid formed. The use of dextran sulphate to increase the 
rate of DNA hybridization has been reported by a number 
of workers. US patent 4,302,204 describes the use of 
dextran sulphate and other charged polysaccharides to 
accelerate hybridization reactions in which one of the 
polynucleotides is covalently attached to a solid 
phase. Polyethylene glycol was found by Renz and 
Kurz (1984) Nucleic Acid Research 12, 3435-3444, to be 
superior to dextran sulphate for hybridizations with 
peroxidase labelled nucleic acids. However, 
subsequent experiments by the author of the present 
invention where the conditions and concentration of the 
other components in the hybridization buffer have been 
altered, showed that dextran sulphate was superior to 
polyethylene glycol when they were used as the sole 
hybridization rate enhancers. US patent 4,689,294 discloses the use of 
polyacrylate and polymethacrylate in hybridization 
buffers, and it states that these two polymers have the 
following properties: 
a) the same rate of hybridization enhancement as 
dextran sulphate, b) resistance to microbial degradation, c) non-specific binding of probe, to the 
commonly used nitrocellulose supports, is substantially 
lower, compared to use of dextran sulphate,  
 d) Polyacrylate is effective at low 
concentrations and is significantly less expensive than 
dextran sulphate. An experiment was performed by the author of 
the present invention in which it was attempted to 
hybridize a peroxidase-labelled nucleic acid probe, 
from solution, to a nucleic acid bound to a charged 
nylon solid support. It was found that with 
polyacrylate in the hybridization buffer at 5% 
concentration, the hybridization of the probe of the 
complementary nucleic acid bound to the solid support 
was prevented. Thus, polyacrylates are unsuitable at 
least for membrane hybridization using peroxidase-labelled 
probes, and Southern blots made with charged 
nylon solid support. The inventor therefore undertook a study to 
determine if other rate enhancers could be found which 
would perform as well as dextran sulphate when used at 
concentrations of 5% (w/v) or less in the hybridization 
buffer. It has now been found that polyvinyl alcohol 
and polystyrene sulphonic acid also increase the rate 
and/or extent of hybridization of complementary 
polynuc
