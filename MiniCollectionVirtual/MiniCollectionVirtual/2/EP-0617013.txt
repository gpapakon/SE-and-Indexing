A copolymerizable oxime ether of the formula 

 
where A is a divalent linking member, R¹ and R² 

independently of one another are each C₁-C₁₀-alkyl, C₁-C₁₀-alkoxy, 
C₅-C₁₀-cycloalkyl or C₅-C₁₀-aryl, each of which may 

furthermore contain 1-3 nonadjacent nitrogen, oxygen or 
sulfur atoms as heteroatoms in the carbon chain or in the 

carbon ring and may be substituted by from one to three 
C₁-C₄-alkyl or C₁-C₄-alkoxy groups, R¹ and R² may be 

hydrogen or R¹ and R² together form a bridge of 3 to 14 
carbon atoms, where some of the carbon atoms may furthermore 

be part of an aromatic ring, Z is an n-valent 
organic radical which contains a copolymerizable ethylenically 

unsaturated group and n is an integer of from 1 to 
3, excluding a compound where at one and the same time Z 

is allyl, A is ortho-phenoxycarbonyl, R¹ is CH₃ and R² is 
CH₃. 
A copolymerizable oxime ether as claimed in claim 
1, wherein Z is a (meth)acryloyl group of the formula 


 
where R³ is hydrogen or methyl and n is 1. 
A process for the preparation of a copolymerizable 
oxime ether as claimed in claim 1, wherein an oxime  

 
ether alcohol of the formula 


 
is reacted with an isocyanate compound of the formula 


A copolymer containing from 0.01 to 30% by weight 
of an oxime ether as claimed in claim 1. 
A copolymer as claimed in claim 4, containing 

a) from 0.01 to 30% by weight of an oxime ether of the 
formula I where Z, A, R¹ and R² have the meanings 

stated in claim 1, but not excluding a compound 
where Z is allyl, A is ortho-phenoxycarbonyl, R¹ is 

CH₃ and R² is CH₃, 
b) from 30 to 99.99% by weight of at least one C₁-C₂₀-alkyl 
(meth)acrylate, one vinyl ether with carboxylic 

acids of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, one vinyl aromatic 
of up to 20 carbon atoms, one ethylenically 

unsaturated nitrile of 3-6 carbon atoms, one vinyl 
halide or one nonaromatic hydrocarbon having 4 to 8 

carbon atoms and at least 2 conjugated double bonds, 
c) from 0 to 30% by weight of at least one comonomer 
having at least one keto or aldehyde group and 
d) from 0 to 50% by weight of at least one further 
monomer, 
 
the copolymer having a glass transition temperature of 

from -60 to +140°C. 
Use of a copolymer as claimed in claim 4 or 5 as 
a coating material. 
Use of a copolymer as claimed in claim 4 or 5 as 
an adhesive.
