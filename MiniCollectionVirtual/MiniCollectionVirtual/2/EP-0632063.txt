<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a catalyst system
comprising a group IV B transition metal compound and an
alumoxane that is highly active in the polymerization of
olefins, and to a process using such a catalyst system
for the production of polyolefins, in particular for the
production of elastomeric ethylene-alpha-olefin
copolymers and terpolymers of ethylene, an alpha-olefin
and a nonconjugated diolefin.Various processes and catalysts exist for the
copolymerization of alpha-olefins. For example, U.S.
Patent No. 3,113,115 (Ziegler et al) discloses that a
plastomeric copolymer of ethylene and propylene may be
prepared using a catalyst system comprising diethyl
aluminum chloride and titanium tetrachloride while U.S.
Patent No. 3,300,459 (Natta et al) discloses that an
elastomeric copolymer of ethylene and propylene
containing from 20 to about 70 weight percent ethylene
can be prepared using a catalyst system comprising
trihexyl aluminum and vanadium oxychloride. From this
technological base, processes for the production of the
commercially important elastomeric ethylene-propylene
copolymers, commonly referred to as EP elastomers, and
the elastomeric terpolymers of ethylene, propylene and a
nonconjugated diolefin, generally referred to as EPDM
elastomers, have been developed.In most current EP and EPDM production processes
the catalysts used for the production of the high
molecular weight elastomers are soluble catalysts formed
from vanadium compounds such as vanadium tetrachloride,
vanadium triacetylacetonate, vanadium trialkoxides and
halogenated vanadium alkoxides which may be used singly 
or as a mixture in conjunction with an organoaluminum
compound such as triethyl aluminum, diethyl aluminum
chloride or ethyl aluminum sesquichloride.With the recent advent of metallocene-alumoxane
coordination catalyst systems for the production of
polyethylene and copolymers of ethylene and alpha-olefins
such as linear low density polyethylene, some
effort has been directed to determining the suitability
of particular metallocene-alumoxane catalyst systems for
the production of EP and EPDM elastomers.Kaminsky et al in J. Poly. Sci. Polymer Chem
Edition, Volume 23, pp 2151-64 (1985) disclose the use
of a soluble bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dimethylalumoxane
catalyst system in the polymerization of
ethylene, propylene and 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene in
toluene solution. By employing the catalyst at low
zirconium concentrations, high aluminum to zirconium
ratios and long reaction times, Kaminsky et al have been
able to
