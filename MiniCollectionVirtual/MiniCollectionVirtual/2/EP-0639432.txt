<ABSTRACT>
For the precise determination of the position of mitre cuts in frames or profile frames, preferably for doors or windows, the invention provides a marking-out frame (14) comprising two members (1, 3) capable of being aligned parallel to one another and displaced relative to one another, as well as a third member (2) running perpendicular to the two parallel-aligned members (1, 3). The members are furnished with measurement scales (7) in the longitudinal direction. A slide (4) with a protractor (5) and a marking-out ruler (6) can be mounted on the members (1, 2, 3) and displaced along them.

Device for applying marking lines for mitre cutting on 
frames and profile frames, comprising a marking frame (14), 

which consists of two parallel side pieces (1, 3), which can 
be moved in relation to each other, and a third side piece (2) 

extending perpendicular to the two parallel side pieces (1, 
3), all of which are marked with a scale along their length, 

and a sliding attachment which can be mounted on the side 
pieces (1, 2, 3) and is moveable and lockable along these in 

grooves (8), characterised in that the sliding attachment (4) 
has a protractor (5) and a marking rule (6), in that the three 

side pieces (1, 2, 3) are fixable, via perpendicular or 
parallel movement in relation to each other, with the aid of 

suitable means of attachment, in that the marking frame (14) 
is mounted on a supporting frame (10) where the first of the 

parallel side pieces (1) is fixed rigidly to the supporting 
frame (10), and in that the supporting frame (10) consists of 

parallel, or perpendicular, supporting frame spars (12) where 
all or part of the supporting frame spars can be moved 

parallel or perpendicular in relation to each other, and that 
the marking frame (14) can be laid on the supporting frame 

(10). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
supporting frame (10) is fitted with auxiliary scales (11). 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
surround frames (16, 17) are used, which have a height 

comparable to the height of the side pieces (1, 2, 3) of the 
marking frame (14) and whose width is comparable to the width 

of the frame sections (18, 19) which are to be cut. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that a deduction measurement stencil (26) is used to 

determine the position of the mitre cuts on the lower end of  
 

the perpendicular window casement frame sections, which can be 
used with both parallel side pieces (1, 3) and with which the 

position of the lower transverse spar of the window casement 
can be marked, dependent on the height of the window. 
Device according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that both the marking frame (14) and the 

supporting frame (10) are designed as a kit which can be 
easily dismantled and reassembled.
