<ABSTRACT>
A method for setting up the memory of an electronic 
controller operates in Fuzzy logic, whereby predetermined 

membership functions (f(m)) of logic variables (M), defined 
within a universe of discourse (U) sampled in a finite number 

of points (m), are subjected to inference operations 
basically configured by IF/THEN rules with at least one front 

preposition and at least one rear implication. The controller 
further comprises a central control unit (3) provided with a 

memory section (5) for storing predetermined values (l) of 
the membership functions (f(m)) which appear in the front or 

IF part of the Fuzzy rules and have a predetermined degree of 
truth or membership (G). This method provides for storing 

into said memory section (5) the only values (l) of those 
membership functions (f(m)) which have a value (l) of the 

degree of membership (G) other than zero at the points (m) of 
the universe of discourse (U).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for setting up the memory 
of an electronic controller operating in Fuzzy logic, and to 
an electronic controller operating in accordance with the 
method. More particular, the invention relates to a method of setting 
up the memory of an electronic controller operating in Fuzzy 
logic, whereby predetermined membership functions f(m) of 
logic variables M -- defined within a so-called universe of 
discourse U sampled in a finite number of points m -- are 
subjected to inference operations basically configured by 
IF/THEN rules with at least one front preposition and at 
least one rear implication, said controller further 
comprising a central control unit provided with a memory 
section for storing predetermined values 1 of the membership 
functions f(m) which appear in the front or IF part of the 
Fuzzy rules and have a predetermined degree of truth or 
membership G. The field of application of this invention is related to 
developments of artificial intelligence in connection with 
electronic data processing instruments based on a logic of 
the so-called Fuzzy type. Fuzzy logic is winning acceptance as a technique which can 
provide solutions to a wide class of control problems, in 
relation to which such traditional techniques as those based 
on Boolean logic have failed to yield acceptable performance  
 
levels at a reasonable cost. A clearer understanding of the invention calls for a brief 
discussion of the two principal methods of representing and 
modelling reality, i.e. of the types of mathematic models 
which can be used to define the terms of a given problem to 
solve. We refer in particular to those methods which are 
commonly used to solve problems with the aid of electronic 
computing instruments. The first method provides a numerical/analytical description 
of reality, and is widely employed in engineering and 
scientific branches for all those applications where all the 
terms of a problem to be solved can be effectively 
identified. This method has had considerable influence on the 
architectures of current data processing instruments, but 
hardly suits those situations where the aspects of the 
problem tend to be "fuzzy" or difficult to identify, as may 
be the case with artificial intelligence applications. In such situations, a modelling technique yielding a 
quantitative and qualitative description of the problem to 
solve has proved to be the most effective, and it is there 
that the Fuzzy logic can provide a body of rules for dealing 
with

formula: 

Word Length = nf(m)*(dim(G)+dim(f(m)), 
 
where 


nf(m) is the number of the non-zero values (l) at the point
