<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a displacement device having a piezoelectric actuator comprising two piezoelectric translation devices which are operatively connected to an output drive element by a spring element, motion being transmitted correspondingly to their change in length, while the operative connection is suppressed by their associated control elements when resetting the piezoelectric translation devices. Because of the permanent pressure exerted by the spring element, secure clamping of the output drive element is guaranteed, by virtue of which the stringent requirements of precision for the control elements and their adjustment travel, which requirements are otherwise necessary for the clamping, can be obviated.

Adjustment apparatus including a piezo-electric drive, in particular for precision engineered optical 
equipment and the like, consisting of at least two piezo-electric translators which experience a change in 

length when an electrical tension is applied and alternately actively connect with an output element such that, 
when an active connection exists, a transfer of movement onto the output element occurs, whereas, when an 

active connection is removed, the piezo-electric translator experiences a reset in preparation for the next 
transfer of movement, with the result that the output element performs the desired adjustment movement,
 
characterised in that
 
the piezo-electric translators (1, 2) can be made to actively connect with the output element (8) by means of 

at least one spring element (15), and an actuating element (3, 4) is associated with each piezo-electric 
translator (1, 2), the actuating element removing the active connection of its piezo-electric translator (1, 2) 

with the output element (8). 
Adjustment apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that, to bring about the active 
connection between piezo-electric translator (1, 2) and output element (8), the spring element (15) acts on 

said output element. 
Adjustment apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that the actuating elements (3, 4) are 
mounted on a common base (14) and the spring element (15) acts on said base. 
Adjustment apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that the actuating elements (3, 4) bring 
about the active connection of their associated piezo-electric translators (1, 2) with the output element (8) by 

way of actuating arms (11, 12), the actuating arms (11, 12) being mounted on a common base (18) and the 
spring element (15) acting on said base (18). 
Adjustment apparatus according to Claim 4, characterised in that the actuating arms (11, 12) are 
urged against the actuating elements (3, 4) by means of springs (16, 17). 
Adjustment apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that the actuating elements (3, 4) 
themselves consist of piezo-electric elements or electrostrictive or magnetostrictive elements. 
Adjustment apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that the actuating elements (3, 4) are 
connected to a control arrangement which removes the active connection of each piezo-electric translator (1,  

 
2) with the output element only after the active connection of the output element (8) with the other piezo-electric 

translator (1, 2) has been established and said other piezo-electric translator (1, 2) has begun the 
transfer of movement. 
Adjustment apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that the piezo-electric translators (1, 
2) are disposed approximately parallel to the direction of output. 
Adjustment apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that the piezo-electric translators (1, 
2) act upon the output element (8) by way of swivel arms (6, 7). 
Adjustment apparatus according to Claim 9, characterised in that the swivel arms (6, 7) are urged 

against the piezo-electric translators (1, 2) by means of further springs (9, 10). 
Adjustment apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that in each case a number of piezo-electric 
translators (1, 2), which operate in the same sense, are connected in parallel. 
Adjustment apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that electrostrictive or magnetostrictive 
elements are installed in place of the piezo-electric translators (1, 2). 
Adjustment apparatus according to Claim 6, characterised in that each piezo-electric translator (20) 
and its associated actuating element (21) are combined into a monolith (22). 
Adjustment apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that, instead of a separate actuating 
element (3, 4) for each piezo-electric translator (1, 2), a common actuating element is provided which acts 

on the piezo-electric translators (1, 2) alternately by way of a rocking beam. 
Adjustment apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that the piezo-electric translators (1, 
2) are controlled by like, temporally staggered voltage waveforms, said translators being made to actively 

connect with the output element (8) by means of the respective actuating element (3, 4) when their change 
in length, as caused by the application of the voltage, corresponds to the desired adjustment direction. 
Adjustment apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that the output element (8) is arranged 
to be stationary and the adjustment apparatus performs the desired adjustment movement.
