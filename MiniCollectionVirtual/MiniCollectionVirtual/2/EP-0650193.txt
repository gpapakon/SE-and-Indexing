<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor 
device mounting a power transistor, a power IC, or the 
like and a method for manufacturing the same. A conventional resin-molded semiconductor device 
mounting power devices such as a power transistor and a 
power IC, is so constructed that the power devices are 
electrically insulated from an envelope (a peripheral 
member of the semiconductor device) other than the 
external electrode terminals (leads) in order to prevent 
an electrical short circuit from occurring between the 
power devices or between the power devices and 
externally-mounted heat dissipation plate. This type of 
conventional semiconductor device is shown in FIGS. 1A, 
1B and 2A to 2C. FIG. 1A is a plan view showing the inside of a 
conventional semiconductor device, and FIG. 1B is a 
cross-sectional view taken along the line 1B - 1B of 
FIG. 1A. In these Figures, reference numeral 11 indicates 
leads. The leads 11 include a large bed 11a, and 
semiconductor elements 12 are mounted on the bed 11a. 
The semiconductor elements 12 are fixed onto the bed 11a 
by solder 13 and electrically connected to the leads 11. 
The leads 11 constitute a lead frame. Electrode pads 
(not shown) are provided on the upper surfaces of the 
semiconductor elements 12 and electrically connected to 
the leads 11 by bonding wires 14.  The leads 11 mounted with the semiconductor elements 
12 are coated with an insulative material such 
as epoxy resin in order to electrically insulate the 
semiconductor elements 12 from outside. Part of each of 
the leads 11 protrudes from a mold body 15 formed of an 
insulative material, and this protruding part serves as 
an outer lead. A heat dissipation plate 16 formed of 
metal such as Al or Cu, is provided through an insulating 
layer under those surfaces of the leads 11 which 
are opposite to the surfaces thereof mounted with the 
semiconductor elements 12, and the insulative mold body 
15 is formed between the leads 11 and plate 16. The 
mold body 15 can be obtained by arranging the leads 11 
mounted with the semiconductor elements 12 and heat 
dissipation plate 16 at regular intervals and then by 
transfer molding using the insulative material. FIG. 2A is a plan view showing another example of 
a conventional semiconductor device, FIG. 2B is a side 
view thereof, and FIG. 2C is a cross-sectional view 
taken along the line 2C - 2C of FIG. 2A. In FIGS. 2A 
to 2C, the same components as those in FIGS. 1A and 1B 
are denoted by the same reference numerals and their
