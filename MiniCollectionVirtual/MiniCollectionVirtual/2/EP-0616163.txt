<ABSTRACT>
A hose clamp (10) with an ear-like structure (12) is 
adapted to be selectively strengthened to achieve desired 

holding ability and/or re-tightening forces, as needed. This 
is achieved by complementary ear-like structures (12a,12b) 

in the overlapping inner and outer band portions (11a,11b) 
with the free ends of the inner and outer band portions connected 

with the corresponding overlapping, respectively, 
overlapped band portion. In addition or in the alternative, 

the ear-like structure (12) is strengthened by external and/or 
internal strengthening members (135) made of spring steel 

with predetermined spring characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to hose clamps with an
ear-like structure strengthened to increase the holding ability
thereof, and more particularly to ear-like structures internally
and/or externally strengthened by the use of one or more
strengthening members which have the shape more or less
complementary to the ear-like structure.Various attempts have been made heretofore to
strengthen ear-like structures of clamps, especially hose clamps,
in order to increase their holding ability and/or their spring
properties which determine the elastic re-tightening forces in
case of expansion of the hose clamp due to temperature and/or
pressure increases. For example, narrow reinforcing grooves of
more or less canoe shape as viewed in plan view have been
proposed in my prior U.S. Patent 3,475,793 for the bridging
portion of so-called "Oetiker" ears. My prior U.S. Patent
3,510,918 proposed the use of an elastic insert member to control
the elastic properties of the ear. A plug made from rod-shaped
elastic material or hollow spring steel was also proposed in my
prior U.S. Patent 3,579,754. Considerable improvements for
increasing the holding ability of ear-like structures were
attained with a reinforcing depression provided in the bridging
portion of the ear-like structure, as more fully disclosed in my
copending application Serial No. 06/922,408,
the subject-matter of which has been published in my 
corresponding British Patent 2,160,577. According to this
application, the reinforcing depression is a relatively shallow,
generally pan-shaped depression of generally rectangular shape as
seen in plan view with the sides extending over substantial
portions of the width and length of the bridging portion in its
non-reinforced condition. Though the various ways of increasing
the holding ability of ear-like structures and/or controlling the
elasticity thereof, as proposed heretofore by me, have proved
very successful, the advent of new hose materials and/or
applications to ever-greater ranges of temperature and/or
pressure changes demand ever-improved characteristics in hose
clamps. Proposals have also been made heretofore by others to
address these and other problems. For example, the U.S. Patent
3,087,221 proposed a hose clamp which had its greatest radial
band thickness near the middle with the thickness progressively
reduced towards the ends for the avowed purpose to maintain a
true circle initially and upon change of diameter. In Figure 3
of this patent, the ear itself was also proposed to be made in
the same

<CLAIMS>
A hose clamp which includes a clamping band (11) with
overlapping band portions (11a, 11b) and means (12) for

tightening the clamp which includes ear-like means (12a, 12b)
in each of the overlapping band portions (11a, 11b), wherein

the ear-like means (12a, 12b) are of complementary shape to
enable a nested relationship with the ear-like means (12a) in

an inner band portion (11a) engaging from within the clamp
into the ear-like means (12b) in an outer overlapping band

portion (11b),

   including first means (14) within an area of the inner
overlapped band portion (11a) following its ear-like means

(12a) in the circumferential direction toward its free end
for connecting at least a free end portion of the inner overlapped

band portion (11a) to the corresponding overlapping
outer band portion (11b).
The hose clamp of claim 1, including second means (15)
within an area of the outer overlapping band portion (11b)

following its ear-like means (12b) in the circumferential
direction toward its free end for connecting the free end

portion of the outer overlapping band portion (11b) to the
corresponding overlapped inner band portion

(11a).
The hose clamp of claim 1 or 2, wherein each clamping
band end portion (11a, 11b) is relatively short in the circumferential

direction so as to minimise material waste, yet 
sufficiently long to accommodate a respective one of the connecting

means (14, 15). (Figure 3)
The hose clamp of any preceding claim, wherein each ear-like
means (12a, 12b) is plastically deformable and includes

two outwardly extending leg portions interconnected by a
bridging portion provided with reinforcing means (13a, 13b),

wherein each reinforcing means (13a, 13b) is formed by a
shallow, generally pan-shaped depression having a substantially

rectangular configuration as viewed in plan view whose
sides constituting the width and length of the rectangular

configuration extend substantially rectilinearly over more
than half the width, respectively, length of the bridging

portion.
The hose clamp of any preceding claim, further including
means (20) assuring a stepless, gap-free internal clamping

surface which includes an insert member (21) internally covering
the circumferential area of overlap of the overlapping

inner and outer band portions and having tongue-like extensions
(22) at the free ends of the insert member (20), wherein

tongue-receiving means (16, 17, 18, 19) are provided in

band (24). (Figures 4-6)

(20) is connected to a part of the clamping band forming the 

outer band portion (11b) and on the side of the ear-like

means includes a pressed-out channel (17) extending

in the clamping band circumferential direction within the
central area thereof while leaving on each side a lateral

clamping band portion (18), and wherein the pressed-out channel
commences within the area of a step-like portion (19)

displacing the lateral clamping band portions to the radial
level of the channel (17).
The hose clamp of any preceding claim, including additional
means (30) in the overlapping band portions within an

band portions (11a, 11b) of complementary shape to enable
corresponding corrugation-like sections to assume a nested
