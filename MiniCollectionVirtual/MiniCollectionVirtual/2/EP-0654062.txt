<ABSTRACT>
Described is the production of hard polyurethane foams by the reaction of (1) polyisocyanates with (2) at least two compounds, of molecular weight between 92 and 10,000, containing hydrogen atoms reactive towards isocyanates, in the presence of (3) hydrofluoroalkanes as foaming agents and (4) at least one of the following compounds as solubilizers: R1-O-CO-O-R2, R1-O-CO-O-CO-O-R2, (I), in which R1 and R2 are C1-C12 alkyl or, together, C2-C6 alkylene and n = 0 to 6; (II), in which R1 to R3 are optionally halogen-substituted C1-C12 alkyl, C5-C10 cycloalkyl or optionally substituted aryl; (III), in which R1 and R2 are C1-C16 alkyl or C5-C10 cycloalkyl; (IV), in which R is C1-C20 alkyl or C5-C10 cycloalkyl plus, optionally, in the presence of (5) other per se prior art auxiliaries and additives.
