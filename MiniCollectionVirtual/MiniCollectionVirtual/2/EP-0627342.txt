<ABSTRACT>
An inflator (12) for a vehicle occupant airbag 
restraint system (10) includes a threaded stud (20) with 

opposed flat surfaces (22), a raised key portion where the 
stud joins an end wall (18) of the inflator (12) and an 

unthreaded lead-in portion at its end. The invention also 
extends to a system including such an inflator (12) and an 

airbag reaction can housing (32) with a slot (34) adapted 
to receive the stud (20). The flattened part (22) of the 

stud (20) prevents incorrect assembly of the system and 
ensures that the inflator has the correct rotational 

orientation with respect to the housing (32) so that 
inflation gas exit ports (16) face in the desired 

direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vehicle airbag restraint 
systems, and more particularly to a positive orientation stud for 
correctly aligning exhaust ports of an inflator with the module 
reaction can of the airbag system. A vehicular airbag restraint system generally includes 
an inflator which may comprise a cylindrical housing which 
encloses some form of gas generating material which when ignited 
generates a non-toxic gas under pressure within the housing. The 
housing is provided with a plurality of predetermined arranged 
ports, which are generally referred to as nozzles. The ports 
direct the generated gas out of the inflator housing into a 
reaction can in which the inflator is positioned along with the 
airbag inflated by the gas. The proper rotational alignment of 
the ports with respect to the reaction can is critical to the 
proper functioning and inflation of the airbag positioned in the 
reaction can. It is an object of this invention to provide a new and 
improved alignment structure in an airbag restraint system for 
aligning the discharge ports of an inflator in a module reaction 
can which assures proper rotational alignment of the ports in the 
reaction can.  Another object of this invention is to provide a new 
and improved alignment structure for an airbag restraint system 
which actually prevents assembly unless the correct rotational 
orientation of the ports occurs. Still another object of this invention is to provide 
a new and improved alignment structure for an airbag restraint 
system which not only assures proper rotational orientation of 
an inflator with respect to a reaction can but also provides 
axial mating for holding the mating parts in proper rotational 
as well as axial orientation. In carrying out this invention, in one illustrative 
embodiment thereof, an inflator, having a generally cylindrical 
chamber therein, is provided for an airbag restraint system. The 
chamber is provided with a plurality of gas dispensing ports 
arranged in a predetermined configuration in the chamber. A 
positive orientation stud flattened on at least one side thereof 
extends from one end of the chamber. The positive orientation 
stud is adapted to fit in a complementary slot in a reaction can 
carrying an airbag to be inflated by gas from the chamber. The 
flattened stud prevents the insertion of the chamber into a 
reaction can unless the stud is in proper aligned position. The invention, together with further objects, aspects, 
features and advantages thereof will be more clearly

<CLAIMS>
An inflator (12) for an airbag restraint system 
(10) comprising an airbag inflator (12) having a generally 

cylindrical chamber (14) therein, 

   a plurality of gas dispensing ports (16) arranged 
in a predetermined configuration in said chamber (14), 

   a positive orientation stud (20) extending from one 
end (18) of said chamber (14) and adapted to be received in 

a reaction can (32) carrying an airbag, 
   said positive orientation stud (20) adapted to be 

positioned in a complementary slot (34) in the reaction can 
(32) for aligning said gas dispensing ports (16) with 

respect to the reaction can (32) thereby ensuring the 
proper alignment and inflation of an airbag when the 

chamber (14) is activated with gas. 
The inflator (12) as claimed in claim 1 in 
which said orientation stud (20) includes at least one flat 

(22, 24) on said stud (20). 
The inflator (12) as claimed in claim 2 in 
which said orientation stud (20) has a pair of parallel 

flats (22, 24) thereon providing a generally rectangular 
configuration as seen from an end view thereof. 
The inflator as claimed in claim 2 or 3 in 
which said positive orientation stud (20) includes a raised 

interface key (30) where the stud (20) extends from said 
chamber (14) which serves as a final mating surface between 

the chamber (14) and a reaction can (32) in which the 
chamber (14) is positioned and for holding the mating parts 

in proper rotational and axial position with respect to 
each other. 
The inflator (12) as claimed in any preceding 
 

claim in which said stud (20) is threaded and adapted to 
receive an attachment nut (36) thereon, said stud (20) 

being provided with an unthreaded lead-in (28) at the 
extreme end thereof for preventing improper threading of 

the nut (36) used to hold the inflator (12) in a reaction 
can (32). 
An airbag restraint system (10) including an 
inflator (12) as claimed in any preceding claim, a reaction 

can housing (32) and means (36) positioned on said stud 
(20) for mounting said inflator (12) in said reaction can 

housing (32), said reaction can housing (32) including a 
complementary mating slot generally conforming to the shape 

of said orientation stud (20) for receiving and mating with 
said orientation stud (20) for providing a predetermined 

rotational orientation of the exhaust ports (16) of said 
cylindrical chamber (14) with respect to said reaction can 

housing (32). 
The air bag restraint system (10) as claimed 
in claim 6 in which said stud (20) is threaded and said 

means (36) for mounting said inflator in said reaction can 
housing comprises a nut. 
The airbag restraint system (10) as claimed in 
claim 6 or 7 in which said orientation stud (20) comprises 

a first key and a second key is provided in the form of a 
raised interface key (30) located where the stud (20) joins 

said one end (18) of said chamber, said second key engaging 
said complementary mating slot (34) of said reaction can 

(32) for retaining the mating inflator (14) and reaction 
can housing (32) in proper rotational and axial orientation 

relative to one another.
