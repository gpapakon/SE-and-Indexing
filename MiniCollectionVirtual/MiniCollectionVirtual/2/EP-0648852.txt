<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a highly machinable, hot-isostatically-compacted, 
prehardened, martensitic steel article 
used for molds for plastic injection molding, metal die casting 
die components, and other hot work tooling components, and to a 
method for producing the same. Typically, molds for plastic injection molding, components 
for die casting dies, hot forging dies, extrusion dies, and other 
hot work tooling, henceforth referred to as molds and dies, are 
manufactured by rough machining the component close to finish 
dimensions from a hot work tool steel mold or die block, hardening 
the rough-machined component by a quenching and tempering type of 
heat treatment, and finally machining the hardened component to 
finish dimensions. During the heat treatment process, dimensional 
changes occur in the rough- machined component as a result of 
metallurgical phase changes in the mold or die block, and as a 
result of nonuniform thermal stresses which are inherent in the 
heat treatment process. These dimensional changes cause the need 
for a second, finish machining operation to be performed after 
heat treatment to machine the component to its final shape and 
dimensions. The required second machining operation results in  
 
increased costs and manufacturing time in the construction of a 
mold or die. The use of a prehardened mold or die block eliminates the 
need for a second, finish machining operation. Prehardened mold 
and die blocks made from conventional, resulfurized, AISI H13 hot 
work tool steel are currently available. The sulfur additions in 
the steel make it machinable at the high hardness needed for mold 
and die applications (35 to 50 HRC), but components manufactured 
from the currently available, prehardened mold and die blocks 
exhibit low toughness and reduced service life because the sulfur 
addition reduces the notch toughness of the steel. In addition, 
the sulfide particles which form in the steel degrade the ability 
of a mold block to be polished to the high-quality surface finish 
that is required in many plastic injection molding applications. Because of the low notch toughness and reduced polishability 
exhibited by the currently available, prehardened mold and die 
blocks, their use is not wide-spread in the plastic injection 
molding and hot work tooling industries. Their low notch 
toughness is a significant disadvantage that reduces their usage 
because of the high costs and safety hazards incurred if a mold or 
die fractures during service. Thus, the potential
