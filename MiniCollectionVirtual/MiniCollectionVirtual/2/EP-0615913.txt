<ABSTRACT>
A box or holder to dispense products contained therein, is 
formed by a single die-cut element, which is folded and 

glued to form the body of a box which is re-sealable after 
being filled with its contents; after it has been opened 

to remove the contents, the assembled box presents an 
opening (12) which extends to one or more sides of the box and 

is re-sealable by means of a flap (10) which is an extension of 
one side of the box and which can be folded and attached 

to the box itself.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a box or holder to 
contain and dispense products. In particular, the present invention relates to a box to 
contain and dispense medicines, cosmetics or similar 
products which are already contained in some form of 
primary packaging e.g. in phials, ampules, blister-packs 
or similar containers. In accordance with a known technique, such products are 
generally put on sale inside boxes or holders also 
containing, in the case of medicines, an information 
leaflet giving the dose and other information. The European Patent Application No. A-0430013, filed on 
19.11.1990 with Italian priority of 30.11.1989, in the 
name of Grafiche Eikon, describes a box or holder for 
medicines or similar products, without information 
leaflets and in which one side of the box extends as a 
folding flap which can be non-permanently attached to the 
outside of one of the sides of the same box. The 
information from the information leaflet is reproduced on 
said movable flap of the box. The presently known boxes all have a problem of interior 
access, e.g. when the contents have to be checked for 
integrity and completeness at the moment of sale. Similarly, all the contents, ampules in their racks or 
blister-packs, must be removed each time a single dose has  
 
to be removed to be administered or taken. US-A-4,284,197 discloses a box, the upper portion of which 
forms a "cap" comprising the top side of the box and three 
lateral sides. This "cap" is pivotable and, when closed, 
overlaps to corresponding three lateral sides of the box. A portion of one of these sides is attached to a side of 
the "cap" and may be removed upon lifting of the "cap". US-A-5,123,589 discloses a recloseable package box for 
developed photographic prints or similar flat articles, 
having length and height substantially greater than its 
thickness when erected. The box has an open top and a top 
closure panel attached at each end corner of its free edge 
to the box body; the attached corners are defined by preset 
rupture lines to permit opening of the closure panel.  
 An object of the present invention is to overcome the 
above mentioned problems by means of a box or holder with 
improved accessibility. This object is achieved by the present invention, which 
relates to a box or holder according to claim 1. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, a 
part of one of the sides of the body of the box is 
attached to the closure flap and a line of perforations 
allows it to be detached from the body of

<CLAIMS>
A box or holder of the type consisting of a single die-cut 
element (1) folded and glued to form the body of a box 

comprising first (3) and second (2) longitudinal sides 
first (4) and second (5) transversal sides and a terminal 

side (6), a flap (10) extending from one of said sides (6) 
and being folded over to another of said sides (3, 3a) 

that is provided with at least an access opening to the 
interior of said made-up open box, characterized in that 

said closure flap is an extension of said terminal side 
(6), said flap and said first longitudinal side (3, 3a) 

are located at opposed ends of the die-cut element, and 
said flap is directly superimposed and fixed to said first 

longitudinal side (3, 3a) of the box in correspondence of 
a part (3a) of said side (3, 3a) defined by pre-set 

rupture lines (13), said part (3a) being detached from the 
remaining part of said side (3) when said closure flap 

(6, 10) is opened to form in whole or in part said access 
opening. 
A box according to claim 1, characterized in comprising 
a first part (7) cut out from the die-cut element on said 

first longitudinal side (3, 3a) of the body of the box, a 
second part (3a) of said side (3), adjacent to said first 

die-cut part (7), defined with respect to the remaining 
part of said side (3) by pre-set rupture lines (13), said  

 
second part being attached to said closure flap (6, 10) 

to be removed from said side (3) of the box together with 
said flap (6, 10) when said flap is opened in order to 

form said access opening. 
A box according to claim 2, characterized in that said 
terminal side (6) of the die-cut element is fixed to said 

second, detachable part (3a) of said first longitudinal 
side (3, 3a).
