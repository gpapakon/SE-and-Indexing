<ABSTRACT>
A graphical user interface "touch screen" having an entire collection of icons displayed at a scale in which the individual function of each icon is recognizable, but too small to easily access features of the function, and wherein upon touching the screen area accommodating an area of the icon, the screen provides a zoomed in version of that area so that the user can select a desired feature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates in general to electronic devices having a relatively small
display for providing a graphical user interface, and in particular to a hand-held electronic
device having a graphical user interface ("GUI") and "touch screen" for accessing an entire
collection of functions of the electronic device.Icons are well known in the art of graphical user interfaces (GUI's) for
controlling information processing systems. An icon is a small pictorial representation of
some larger set of information. An icon provides information, in a condensed format, about
the content or status of the underlying system. Icons are designed to trigger, through visual
perception, operator concepts that communicate the content or operation of the system in a
quick manner. The system then can be easily accessed or used through actuation of the icon.An example of a controller unit for a home entertainment system is the Stage 3
Controller unit of Kenwood, described in Kenwood's publicly available manual "STAGE 3/Setting
up your KC-Z1 Controller", 1996. The control unit includes a hand-held controller
with a touch screen functionality for the GUI. The GUI provides a large number of icons that
correspond to a large number of system functionalities. The functionalities are activated
through the icons on the touch screen. The GUI is user-programmable to select the icons that
should be present in the main menu and those that should not. This is due to the relatively
small amount of screen space available to the GUI.Today's home entertainment systems have a large number of functions
available to the user. The Kenwood uses a GUI to extend the number of functions that are
available. The problem with GUI displays for hand-held devices, such as remote controls for
consumer electronic devices, for personal digital assistants, and even for photocopiers is that
they are relatively tiny. Adding the touch screen functionality to these displays means the
displayed icons have to be large enough to be accessible by a person's fingers or if the icons
are tiny, then they must be large enough so that some type of stylus can be used to "touch" the 
icon. If larger icons are used the number of functionalities to be displayed diminishes. These
drawbacks limit the use of touch screen displays on hand-held devices.European Patent Application EP-A-0 542 660 discloses a data display
comprising icons representing events, such as meetings in a calender. The dimensions of the
icons depict factors of the underlying information. For example, the

<CLAIMS>
A method of operating an electronic device, comprising the steps of:

displaying on a graphical user interface touch screen (13) a function of the electronic device
in the form of an icon (12) and at a scale size in which the function is recognizable by a user

but too small to easily access a feature of the function; and
providing a magnified version (16) of at least an area of the icon upon the user touching the
area of the icon such that the area of the icon becomes large enough for the user to easily

access features within the area of the icon by touching the touch screen.
A method as claimed in claim 1, further including the step of causing (35) the
magnified version to scroll across the icon such that new areas of the icon are magnified.
A method as claimed in claim 1, further including the step of restoring (35) the
icon to the scale size after selection of a feature.
A method as claimed in claim 1, further including the step of indicating
(18,35) that a feature has been selected by the user.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the icon has a size of n√ón and the
magnified version is the same size.
An electronic device, comprising:

a controller (35); and
a graphical user interface with touch screen functionality (30) which, under control of the
controller, displays a set of user selectable options (12) and upon user activation of the touch

screen in a region comprising a subset of the options, the graphical user interface displays the
subset of the options at a magnified scale (16).
An electronic device as claimed in claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the device
constitutes a PDA, the controller being arranged to display and control functions of said

PDA.
An electronic device as claimed in claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the device
constitutes a remote control for controlling a consumer electronics device, the controller

being arranged to display and control functions of said consumer electronics device.
An electronic device as claimed in claim 8, wherein at least one of the icons
(23,24,25) depicts a remote control device for a particular type of consumer electronic

device.
