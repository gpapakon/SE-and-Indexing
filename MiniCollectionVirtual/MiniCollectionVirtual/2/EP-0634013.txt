<ABSTRACT>
A solid phase capable of detecting the presence of nicotine and/or nicotine metabolites is described. The solid phase is impregnated with assay reagents including a color determinant, a buffer, a cyanogen releasing agent and a cyanogen halide forming agent. The solid phase provides a means whereby unprocessed urine samples over a wide range of different pH values can be tested for the presence of nicotine and/or nicotine metabolites. The assay results may be determined by direct visualization of the color of the solid phase. Also described are methods of preparating and using the solid phase, and kits containing the solid phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nicotine 
and/or nicotine metabolite detection system. More 
specifically, the invention provides a method, a solid 
support and a kit, all for detecting nicotine and/or 
nicotine metabolites in urine. Nicotine use such as by cigarette smoking is a 
major public health problem. Clinicians and 
epidemiologists often need an accurate assessment of 
whether and to what extent a person smokes or 
otherwise uses nicotine. Relying upon self-reporting 
by nicotine users regarding their nicotine habits is 
often inaccurate. In addition, clinicians and 
epidemiologists may require information concerning 
inhalation of secondary smoke by non-smokers as well 
as concerning other passive exposure to nicotine as a 
result of environmental conditions. Various assays 
have been developed to independently obtain such 
information. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has 
been used to specifically determine the level of 
cotinine, a nicotine metabolite, in the urine of 
subjects. (Watson, J.D., J. Chromatogr, 143:203 
(1977); Kyerematen, G.A., Clin. Pharmacol. Ther., 
32:769 (1982)). Cotinine levels also have been tested 
using gas chromatography (GC). (Jacob, P. et al., J. 
Chromatogr. 222:61 (1981); Hengen, N. and Hengen, M., 
Clin. Chem.24:50 (1978); Feyerabend, C. and Russell, 
M., Analyst105:993 (1980)). Both of these methods 
require expensive equipment, trained personnel, and  
 
are very time consuming. Radioimmunoassays (RIA) 
(Langone, J., et al., Biochemistry12:5025 (1973); 
Knight, G. et al. Clin. Chem.31:118 (1985)), and 
enzyme linked immunoassays (ELISA) that measure 
cotinine have also been developed. (Langone et al. J. 
Immunol. Methods114:73 (1988)). Such assays also 
require special equipment, trained personnel and 
special reagents. Various assays for isoniazid, a drug used in 
the treatment of tuberculosis, have been reported. 
Originally, Rubin etal. (Dis. Chest. 21: 439 (1952)) 
developed a method for the identification of isoniazid 
metabolites using cyanogen bromide. Nielsch and 
Giefer (Arzneimittel-Forschung9: 636 (1959); 
Arzneimittel-Forschung9: 700 (1959)), using 
chloramine-T and potassium cyanide, developed an assay 
by which the pyridine ring of isoniazid metabolites is 
split by cyanogen chloride and condensed with 
barbituric acid to give a blue to purple color. This 
was modified by Belle and Littleman (Med. J. Aust.2: 
588 (1962)) for a quantitative determination of 
isoniazid metabolites, and was later modified by Kasik 
et al. to be used
