<ABSTRACT>
A system for protecting surfaces and facilitating the removal of unwanted substances therefrom is disclosed, the system including a poymeric coating having a low volatile organics content (VOC) which is safe for the environment, and a cleaner for application to the coating to remove material from the coating, such as graffiti. The coating may be either a water-based epoxy comprising a bisphenol A resin and polyamide resin, or an aliphatic urethane comprising a polymer having reactive sites which react with an isocyanate and an aliphatic isocyanate. The cleaner is suitable for removing all manner of epoxy and urethane based spray paints, indelible inks, industrial chemicals, and the like. The cleaner comprises N-methyl pyrrolidone in a concentration of fifty percent by weight or greater and a surfactant.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SÏ‹RFACE PRE-TREATMENT FOR THE REMOVAL OF GRAFFITI THEREFROMTechnical Field: This invention relates to means for facilitating removal of unwanted substances, such as graffiti, from walls or similar surfaces. Specifically, this invention relates to the pre-treatment of surfaces with environmentally safe coatings which allow removal of contaminants and graffiti from the surface without degradation of the underlying coating. Background: The application of graffiti to walls, vehicles and other surfaces has been a concern to society and individuals for decades. Graffiti is not only unsightly, but destructive, and leads to the expenditure of millions of dollars each year to obliterate or remove the graffiti and to restore the underlying surface. In some cities, for example, graffiti is such a pervasive problem that special booths are constructed through which municipal buses are driven to clean and restore the paint on the body of the vehicle.Traditionally, graffiti has been removed by sandblasting the painted surface, but sandblasting obviously damages the surface over time and reduces its longevity. Graffiti has also been removed by simply repainting or recoating the graffitied surface. Repainting or recoating, however, is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, a variety of systems have been developed for preventing, removing or obliterating graffiti. Examples of such systems are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,039,745 to Riddle, issued August 13, 1991 (system providing a non-stick surface); U.S. Patent No. 4,478,975 to Dessaint, issued October 23, 1984 (disclosing a fluorinated copolymer for water- and oil- proofing surfaces); U.S. Patent No. 4,716,056 to Fox, et al., issued December 29, 1987 (disclosing a pre-reacted water-based epoxy color coating for obliterating 

graffiti) ; U.S. Patent No. 5,024,780 to Leys, issued June 18, 1991 (disclosing a substance for removing graffiti as well as paint and other coatings); U.S. Patent No. 5,017,237 to Svensson, issued May 21, 1991 (disclosing a polysaccharide coating which hardens on a surface and which is thereafter removed when soiled); U.S. Patent No. 4,353,745 to Ebbeler, issued October 12, 1982 (disclosing a clear protective coating for a surface which is thereafter removed when soiled); and U.S. Patent No. 4,600,522 to Grzeskowiak, et al., issued July 15, 1986(disclosing a biodegradable cleaner for removing graffiti from anodized aluminum, stainless steel and glass) .One of the most commonly used graffiti removal systems at present comprises coating a

CLAIMS What is claimed is:
1. A system for facilitating removal of unwanted substances and graffiti from a surface, comprising: a protective coating formed from non-pre-reacted components including a polymer, solvent and reactant, said protective coating being resistant to degradation from the application of N-methyl pyrrolidone in a concentration of one hundred percent for a period longer than fifteen minutes; and a cleaner providing removal of unwanted substances from said coating without degrading said coating.
2. The system of Claim 1 wherein said protective coating has an 85 D Shore hardness, is resistant to abrasion and is resistant to flaking, yellowing and cracking.
3. The system of Claim 2 wherein said protective coating is an aliphatic urethane comprising: a base component including a polymer having reactive sites which react with an isocyanate, at least one solvent, and a catalyst; and a reactant component including an aliphatic isocyanate.
4. The system of Claim 3 wherein said polymer is selected from the group of polymers consisting of acrylic polyols, polyether polyols, polyamines, ethylene or propylene glycols and saturated polyester polyols, and said aliphatic isocyanate is selected from the group of isocysnates consisting of hexamethylene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, diphenylmethane 4, 4' diisocyanate and toluene diisocyanate. 


 5. The system of Claim 3 wherein said cleaner comprises N-methyl pyrrolidone in a concentration of between fifty percent and 100 percent by weight, and a surfactant.
6. A polymeric coating for application to a surface to facilitate removal of unwanted substances subsequently applied to said surface, said polymeric coating being formed of nonpre-reacted polymeric materials and comprising about thirteen percent by weight bisphenol A epoxy resin; about two percent by weight glycidyl ether diluent; about one half of one percent by weight of a coalescing agent; about one half of one percent by weight of a defoamer; about three percent by weight of 2-butoxyethanol; about fifteen percent by weight water; about seventeen percent by weight of a pigment; about thirty percent by weight polyamide resin; about eight percent by weight of isopropyl alcohol; and about thirteen percent by weight of water.
7. A method of making a surface impenetrable from and cleanable of graffiti and unwanted substances applied thereto, comprising: preparing said surface for application of an impenetrable protective coating thereon; combining a polymeric component and a reactant component to initiate cross-linking of polymers therein; applying said combination of said polymeric and reactant components to said surface to form said impenetrable protective coating thereon; curing said impenetrable protective coating for about forty-eight hours.
8. The method according to Claim 7 wherein said impenetrable protective coating is an aliphatic urethane comprising a polymer having reactive sites which react with an isocyanate and an aliphatic isocyanate. 



said aliphatic urethane coating having a high density of cross-linked bonding rendering it unaffected by contact with N-methyl pyrrolidone in a concentration of one hundred percent for longer than fifteen minutes.
9. The method according to Claim 7 further comprising applying a cleaner to said impenetrable protective coating to remove unwanted substances from said surface, said cleaner containing greater than fifty percent concentration by weight of n-methyl pyrrolidone and a surfactant.
10. A method for combining nonpre-reacted polymeric components to produce an impenetrable and cleanable coating facilitating removal of graffiti and unwanted substances therefrom comprising: mixing together twenty-nine percent to thirty-three percent by weight of a curable polymer having reactive groups which react with isocyanates and twenty-three to twenty-seven percent by weight of an aliphatic isocyanate; adding to said mixture of said polymer and said aliphatic isocyanate between thirty-seven and forty-five percent by weight of solvent and mixing; and adding up to five percent by weight of a flatting agent, flow agent, catalyst or anti-settling agent, or mixtures thereof, and mixing.
