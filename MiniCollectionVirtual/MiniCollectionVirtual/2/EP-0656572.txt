easily judge whether radio waves containing correct 

information about time or radio waves containing abnormal 
information about time are being received. 
A radio wave-corrected timepiece comprising receiving 
means 101 for receiving radio waves containing encoded 

information about time and producing a rectangular pulse 
train containing encoded information about time, memory means 

102 for storing the rules of the encoded information about 
time, comparing means 103 for comparing the output signal 

from the receiving means 101 with the output from the memory 
means 102, and calculating means 104 for receiving the output 

from the comparing means 103, calculating the time, and 
providing an output permitting correction of the contents of 

a timing signal generating means 132.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radio wave-corrected timepiece capable of extracting
information about time from radio waves containing encoded information
about time and correcting the time accroding to the preamble of the claim.Such a radio wave-corrected timepiece is for example known from
EP-A-0 308 881 or EP-A-0 374 745.The time pieces disclosed in these documents incorporate
a counter which is incremented each time the reception of
a time information is started, and which is resetted each
time an error-free time information is received. The
contents of the counter is displayed and indicates the
number of subsequent unsuccessful attempts to receive
a time information.Additionally, in a known structure described in Japanese Patent
Publication JP-B-61-191981(1986), received radio waves are
converted into a pulse train, and an indicator or hand is
moved in synchronism with the pulse train obtained by the
conversion. In a radio timepiece of another known structure,
the intensity of received radio waves is displayed, as
described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,105,396.However, in the first-mentioned prior art technique, a
decision made as to whether the received radio waves are
being jammed or in normal state depends on an operation
consisting of watching an indicator or hand. Therefore,
there is a possibility that the decision is made incorrectly.The second-mentioned prior art technique has the problem
that it is impossible to judge whether the received radio
waves are being jammed or in normal state, although the
intensity of the received radio waves can be known. It is an object of the present invention to
provide a radio wave-corrected timepiece
enabling one to judge whether received radio waves
containing information about time are being jammed or not.This object is achieved with a radio wave-corrected timepiece according to claim 1.In a preferred embodiment, the period of time for which a
receiving circuit is in operation is measured. This permits
the time starting with reception to be measured.In Fig. 1, oscillating means 130 generates a periodic
signal. Dividing means 131 produces a signal having a
frequency which is a submultiple of the frequency of the 
periodic signal from the oscillating means. Timing signal
generating means 132 receives the output from the dividing
means 131 and measures time. The time measured by the timing
signal generating means 132 is displayed on first displaying
means 133. Radio waves containing encoded information about
time are received by an antenna 100, which converts the
