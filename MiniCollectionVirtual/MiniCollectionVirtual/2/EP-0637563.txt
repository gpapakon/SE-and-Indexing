<ABSTRACT>
A mobile crane consists of a travel unit and a revolving superstructure rotatably mounted on the travel unit. A telescopic jib which can be pivoted by a luffing cylinder is mounted on the revolving superstructure. So that such a crane can be quickly put into its operating state and conversely into its transport state, the telescopic jib consists of two parts which can be bolted to one another and of which each has an outer telescopic tube from which in each case at least one telescopic section can be telescoped.

Mobile crane, comprising a travel unit and a 
rotatable superstructure which is mounted on the travel 

unit and on which a telescopic jib, pivotable by means of 
a luffing cylinder, is mounted, characterized in that the 

telescopic jib comprises two parts (4, 6; 9, 10, 12) 
which can be bolted to one another in a non-articulated 

manner and of which each has an outer telescopic tube (4, 
9) from which in each case at least one telescopic 

section (6; 10, 11, 12) can be telescopically extended; 
and in that a rear stay support (14) is articulated at 

the bottom end area of the outer telescopic tube (9) of 
the top part of the telescopic jib, which stay support 

(14) is held relative to the top outer telescopic tube 
(9) via a collapsible auxiliary stay (15); and in that 

the end of the stay support (14) can be stayed relative 
to the foot area of the bottom outer telescopic tube (4) 

by a bottom stay (19, 20) and relative to the head area 
of one of the telescopically extendable top telescopic 

sections by a collapsible top stay (22, 23). 
Mobile crane according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that only one inner telescopic section (6) can be 

telescopically extended from the bottom, outer telescopic 
tube (4) forming the articulated piece. 
Mobile crane according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that at least two and preferably three telescopic 

sections (10, 11, 12) can be telescopically 
extended from the top outer telescopic tube (9) which can 

be connected to the inner telescopic section (6) of the 
bottom part of the telescopic jib. 
Mobile crane according to one of Claims 1 to 3,  
 

characterized in chat the stays consist of rods. 
Mobile crane according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the top stay, articulated at the 

head area of the first telescopic section (10), consists 
of two rods (22, 23) connected to one another in an 

articulated manner in their centre area. 
Mobile crane according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the bottom stay (19, 20) is separable 

in its centre area (18).
