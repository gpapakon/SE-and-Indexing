<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a rotary forming apparatus intended for continuously forming at least one marking line on a carton blank by means of two rotary cylinders (1, 2) including marking profiles, namely a first relief-marking profile (5) provided on one cylinder (1) and a second hollow profile (3) provided on the other cylinder (2) between which the carton blank is pressed, the cross-section of the hollow profile (3) having two especially substantially parallel opposite sides of the width of the marking line to be formed, characterised in that the relief profile (5) has a cross-section consisting of two substantially radial sides (9) extending from the cylinder (1), each followed by at least one chamfer (11) sloping at an acute angle ( alpha ) with respect to each side (9).

<CLAIMS>
Rotary forming apparatus intended to ensure continuous 
formation of at least one marking filet on a cardboard 

blank (4), by means of two rotating rollers (1, 2) comprising 
marking profiles, namely a first marking profile 

in relief (5) provided on one roller (1) and a second 
recessed profile (3) provided on the other roller (2), 

between which the cardboard blank (4) is pressed, the 
cross section of the recessed profile (3) presenting 

two opposite, substantially parallel sides, with the 
width (a) of the marking filet to be formed, characterized 

in that the profile in relief (5) presenting a cross 
section constituted by two substantially radial sides 

(9) spaced apart by a distance (b) less than that of 
the sides of the recessed profile (3) and which extend 

from the roller (1) and are each followed by at least 
one chamfer (11, 11a, 11b) inclined by an acute angle 

(α) with respect to each side (9). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that each of the chamfers (11) is inclined with respect 

to each side (9) by an angle (α) included between 30° 
and 60°. 
Apparatus according to either one of the preceding 
Claims, characterized in that the cross section of the 

recessed profile (3) is joined, in its upper part, with 
the surface of the roller (2) by at least one chamfer 

(10, 10a). 
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the chamfer forms a continuous convex line (10a).
