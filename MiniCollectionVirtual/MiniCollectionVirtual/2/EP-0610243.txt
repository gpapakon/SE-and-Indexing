<ABSTRACT>
A device which serves as a combined ladder and fender for marine purposes, and consists of two vertical side members (1) parallel to each other and between which horizontal steps (2) are provided. To each side member (1) is attached a fender element (5) of a particular design. A cross section through the fender elements (5) in a vertical plane parallel to the main plane of the device through the side members (1) and the steps (2), or in a vertical plane perpendicular to the main plane, will result in a shape approximating a quadrilateral. This quadrilateral has two sides parallel to each other but of different lengths, while the third side is perpendicular to the two parallel sides and the fourth side slants in relation to the opposite side. The device can also serve as an embarkation ladder, a safety ladder, a bathing ladder and a life-buoy.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SAFETY DEVICE FOR MARINE PURPOSES The present invention is a combined ladder and fender for boats. It is designed to serve equally well as a ladder and as a fender, without one function being detrimental to the other. The device can also be used as a safety ladder, boarding ladder, bathing ladder and life-buoy.In later years there has been a strongly developing trend in purchasing and enjoying the use of yachts and pleasure craft of various types. In this respect two factors stand out in importance. A pleasure boat represents a sizeable investment and it is desirable to keep it in best shape as long as possible. One wishes therefore to avoid the danger of damage to boats when they dock alongside quay, alongside another craft or in marinas with floating stages and piers, especially in wind and rough seas.Fenders have traditionally been used to prevent such damage. With a soft surface and a somewhat compressible consistency, their purpose is to protect hull and freeboard. Fenders vary greatly in shape, from the spherical balls of rope to cork and plastic fenders. The function and suitability of a fender depend largely on its design. A spherical fender provides a safe distance from boat to quay but a minimal contact face and an unstable contact point against irregular surfaces. A cylindrical fender provides a larger contact face. However, this is not always sufficient in certain cases as it slips easily. The most practical fenders are designed with a large contact face. The use of fenders with traditional designs is particularly problematic as a protection against quays using car tyres as fenders. The boat's own fenders slide inside and between the tyres and are of little use for preventing discoloration of the boat by the tyres. In addition, quays which are supported 

 by straight vertical posts only have always been a problem for small craft. The traditional shapes given to fenders prevent the fenders from resting against the posts in a stable position, and it is necessary to resort to the well-known trick of using a so-called fender board a between the quay posts b and the boat's fenders. See figure 6.For reasons of convenience and safety, various devices have traditionally been used for embarking and disembarking. When the deck of the craft and the quay, or floating stage or other craft, are at different heights, it has been necessary to use ladders or gangways made of rope, wood or metal.The rapidly increasing number of yachts and pleasure boats has accelerated the development of marinas equipped

 CLAIMS
1. A device for use as a combined ladder and fender for boats, with at least one fender element, side members and steps c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the device consists of two parallel side members (1) in between which at least two separate steps (2) parallel to each other are provided, and having a fender element (5) attached to each side member (1).
2. A device for use as a combined ladder and fender of claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the cross section of the fender element (5) in two vertical planes at right angles to each other results in a shape approximating that of a quadrilateral where to sides of different lengths are parallel to each other while the third side is perpendicular to each of the parallel sides, with the fourth side slanting in relation to the opposite side.
3. A device for use as a combined ladder and fender of the previous claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the fender elements (5) are designed so that a plane tangent to both fender elements (5) on one side of the side members (1) is parallel to the main plane through the side members (1) and the steps (2), while a plane tangent to the fender elements (5) on the opposite side of the main plane of the device makes an angle with the main plane. 


 AMENDED CLAIMS
[received by the International Bureau on 20 January 1993 (20.01.93); new claims 4-6 added; other claims unchanged (1 page)]
1. A device for use as a combined ladder and fender for boats, with at least one fender element, side members and steps characterized in that the device consists of two parallel side members (1) in between which at least two separate steps (2) parallel to each other are provided, and having a fender element (5) attached to each side member (1).
2. A device for use as a combined ladder and fender of claim 1, characterized in that the cross section of the fender element (5) in two vertical planes at right angles to each other results in a shape approximating that of a quadrilateral where to sides of different lengths are parallel to each other while the third side is perpendicular to each of the parallel sides, with the fourth side slanting in relation to the opposite side.
3. A device for use as a combined ladder and fender of the previous claims, characterized in that the fender elements (5) are designed so that a plane tangent to both fender elements (5) on one side of the side members (1) is parallel to the main plane through the side members (1) and the steps (2), while a plane tangent to the fender elements (5) on the opposite side of the main plane of the device makes an angle with the main plane. 4. A device for use as a combined ladder and fender of claim 1, characterized in that to each side member (1) is attached an additional side member (1) with two parallel steps (2) in between said side members so as to provide a ladder (1,2) which is rotationally attached to said device and can be rotated so as to be parallel to said device. 5. A device for use as a combined ladder and fender of claim 4, characterized in that more than one ladder (1,2) and more than one device can hang rotationally after one another.
6. A device for use as a combined ladder and fender of claims 1,3, 4 and 5, characterized in that the steps (2) are provided with a recess which is longitudinally parallel to said steps (2) to improve handgrip on said steps (2).
