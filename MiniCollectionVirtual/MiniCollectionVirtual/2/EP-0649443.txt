<DESCRIPTION>
 "OXAZOLONE DERIVED MATERIALS'1. FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to the logical development of biochemical and biopharmaceutical agents and of new materials, including fabricated materials such as fibers, beads, films and gels. Specifically, the invention relates to the development of molecular modules derived from oxazolone (azlactone) and related structures, and to the use of these modules in the aεse bly of molecules and fabricated materials with tailored properties, which are determined by the contributions of the individual building modules. The molecular modules of the invention are preferably chiral, and can be used to synthesize new compounds and fabricated materials which are able to recognize biological receptors, enzymes, genetic materials, and other chiral molecules, and are thus of great interest in the fields of biopharmaceuticals, separation and materials science.2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe discovery of new molecules has traditionally focuεed in two broad areas, biologically active molecules, which are used as drugs for' the treatment of life-threatening diseases, and new materials, which are used in commercial, especially high- technological applications. In both areas, the strategy used to discover new molecules has involved two basic r>jerations: (i) a more or less random choice of a molecular candidate, prepared either via chemical synthesis or isolated from natural sources, and (ii) the testing of the molecαlar candidate for the property or properties of interest. This discovery cycle is repeated indefinitely until a molecule possessing the desirable 

properties is located. In the majority of cases, the molecular types chosen for testing have belonged to rather narrowly defined chemical classes. For example, the discovery of new peptide hormones has involved work with peptides; the discovery of new therapeutic steroids has involved work with the steroid nucleus; the discovery of new surfaces to be used in the construction of computer chips or sensorε haε involved work with inorganic materials, etc. As a result, the discovery of new functional molecules, being ad hoc in nature and relying predominantly on serendipity, has been an extremely time-conεuming, laborious, unpredictable, and costly enterpriεe.A brief account of the strategies and tactics used in the discovery of new molecules is described below. The emphasis is on biologically interesting molecules; however, the technical problems encountered in the discovery of biologically active molecules as
