<ABSTRACT>
Injection syringe of disposable type, comprising a cylinder (1), in which a piston is displaceable in and out respectively, a piston rod (3) having a press plate (12), and an injection needle (4) at the end of the syringe cylinder (1), and in which the syringe needle (4) is mounted from inside the syringe cylinder (1) and is releasably connected (5, 9) to said syringe cylinder (1), and in which the syringe needle (4) or the carrier (5) thereof is formed with one or more blocking (ratchet) means (6) which cooperate with the syringe piston (2) or the piston rod (3), and which blocks the piston against being retracted after the sole injection is made, so that the syringe needle (4) becomes retracted into the inner of the syringe cylinder (1) upon withdrawal of the piston (2) after the injection has taken place.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a disposable injection
syringe, and the invention is more particularly concerned with a disposable
injection syringe comprising a piston, a cylinder in which a piston is
movable inwards and outwards, a piston rod having a press plate, and an
injection needle at the end of the syringe cylinder, in which the injection
needle is mounted from inside the syringe cylinder and is releasable at its
mounting place in the syringe cylinder, and having means for retracting said
injection needle into the cylinder upon withdrawal of the piston rod,
whereby the injection needle or a carrier thereof is formed with one or more
ratchet means which cooperate(s) with the syringe piston or the syringe
piston rod, the ratchet means being in the form of barbs acting so that the
injection needle, after the piston has been introduced in the syringe
cylinder, upon an attempt to pull the piston back in the syringe cylinder,
pulls the injection needle into a position inside the syringe cylinder.Such a syringe is designed such that it is made unusable for re-use
after it has been used one single time, and which, in addition thereto,
makes it possible to hide the injection needle tip for preventing said
injection needle tip from coming into contact with any object. The invention
also covers both pre-filled syringes and syringes which can filled and can be
used for injection purposes - only once.By a disposable syringe is meant, in this connection, both a prefilled
syringe which can not be refilled, and a syringe which can be filled only
once and can, in connection thereto, be used only once for injection
purposes, and also a syringe which makes it possible to take blood samples
or other types of laboratory samples only once and, in connection thereto,
to expel said sample from the syringe.The disposable syringes which are on the market to-day are mainly
simple and cheap plastic copies of conventional syringes, and said known
syringes are often being reused, in particular in the third world. It is also
common that one and the same syringe is used by several persons within
addict circles in that the syringe is lent to other persons, whereby infections
are easily being transmitted from sick people to healthy people.A few attempts have been made to provide disposable syringes
which do not allow a refilling thereof. One such solution, known for
instance from WO 91/12841, is built on the principle that the syringe 
piston becomes locked up in its innermost position after the injection has
been

<CLAIMS>
A disposable injection syringe comprising a piston (2), a cylinder
(1) in which a piston (2) is movable inwards and outwards, a piston rod (3)

having a press plate (12), and an injection needle (4) at the end of the
syringe cylinder (1), in which the injection needle (4) is mounted from inside

the syringe cylinder (1) and is releasable at its mounting place in the syringe
cylinder (1), and having means for retracting said injection needle

(4) into the cylinder (1) upon withdrawal of the piston rod (3), whereby the
injection needle (4) or a carrier (5) thereof is formed with one or more

ratchet means (6) which cooperate(s) with the syringe piston (2) or the
syringe piston rod (3), the ratchet means being in the form of barbs acting

so that the injection needle (4), after the piston (2) has been introduced in
the syringe cylinder (1), upon an attempt to pull the piston back in the

syringe cylinder, pulls the injection needle (4) into a position inside the
syringe cylinder, 
characterized
 in that the piston rod is hollow, or is formed
with one or more pairs of piston rod legs (11, 11a, 11b) and has along the

inner surface or along the edges of the piston rod legs facing each other
barbs (13, 13a, 13b) extending along part of said inner surface or said piston rod legs and

arranged to engage said ratchet means (6) which is connected to an
inwardly in 
t
he piston rod extending pull rod (15) of the syringe needle (4).
Injection syringe according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the
pull rod (15) is fixedly

connected to the injection needle (4) or to the needle carrier (5), and
at the free end thereof, has a ratchet means (14) arranged to

cooperate with the barbs (13, 13a, 13b) of the piston rod (3) thereby
allowing an introduction of the piston rod (3) into the syringe cylinder (1)

but not a free withdrawal of the piston rod out of the cylinder (1).
Injection syringe according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in that the
ratchet means at the end of the pull rod (15) comprises one or more

spring arms (14) which, with the free ends thereof, are facing the needle
end of the syringe, and which cooperate(s) with the barbs (13, 13a, 13b) of

the piston rod (3), which barbs (13, 13a, 13b) are arranged with the locking
barb portion thereof facing the injection needle end of the syringe and with

the trailing end facing the free end of the piston rod (3). 
Injection syringe according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized
 in that
the piston rod or the piston rod legs (11, 11a, 11b) are smooth and have no

barbs (13, 13a, 13b) along a little length thereof as seen from the piston (2)
and back therefrom, and in that the ratchet means (14) at the

end of the pull rod (15) is arranged to be positioned closest to the piston (2)
at sai
d barb-free portion when the piston rod (3) is in position for injection.
Injection syringe according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the
ratchet means is a double function means which allows a sole time filling of

the syringe with injection medium, or a sole time taking of samples and an
sole time injection and an sole time expelling of the laboratory sample

respectively and which comprises

an outer ratchet cylinder (17) which, along one side thereof or along
two opposed generatrixes, has paws or barbs (19) which cooperate with

equivalent pawls or barbs (13a) on the piston rod (3) and which allow a free
withdrawal of the piston (2) a sole time only,
and a spring yoke (14) which, with the free ends of its spring arms
facing the piston (2), cooperate with other pawls or barbs (13b) of the

piston rod (3), which allow a free introduction of the piston into the cylinder
(1) but which, upon withdrawal of the piston (2) makes the injection needle

(4) become retracted into the inner of the cylinder (1).
Injection syringe according to claim 5, 
characterized
 in that the
barbs (13a) of the piston rod (3) which cooperate with the outer ratchet

cylinder (17) are arranged with the locking edges thereof directed oppositely
to the piston (2) and with the trailing edges thereof facing the piston (2), so

that the ratchet cylinder (17) can be moved from a initial position spaced
from the piston (2) to an end position adjacent the piston (2), whereas

those barbs (13b) which cooperate with the spring yoke (14) are directed
oppositely.
