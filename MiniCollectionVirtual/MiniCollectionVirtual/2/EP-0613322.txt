<ABSTRACT>
A loudspeaker having a repulsion magnetic circuit 
capable of suppressing negative magnetic fluxes. The 

loudspeaker has magnets with the same poles being faced 
each other and an outer magnet magnetized in a direction 

different from the counter magnets is disposed outside of 
the counter magnets. A voice coil containing magnetic 

material is disposed outside of a magnet magnetized in a 
radial direction from the inner wall to the outer wall of 

the magnet, or outside of a magnet assembled by magnet 
pieces magnetized in a predetermined direction and 

arranged to take the same magnetization direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a moving coil type
loudspeaker, and more particularly to a loudspeaker in
which two magnets are disposed with the same poles being
faced each other and a voice coil is disposed in a
repulsion magnetic field generated by the magnets.Various types of loudspeakers have been proposed
heretofore, in which two magnets are disposed with the
same poles being faced each other and a voice coil is
disposed in a repulsion magnetic field generated by the
magnets (for example, refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open
Publications Nos.59-148500 and 1-98400). One example of
such loudspeakers is shown in Fig. 9. Two magnets M1 and
M2 magnetized in the thickness direction are disposed
with the same poles being faced each other, and a center
plate P is sandwiched between the magnets. A tape or the
like made of magnetic material F such as amorphous
material is wound on the outer circumference of a voice
coil 1 wound with a coil made of conductive material C
such as copper. This voice coil 1 is disposed spaced 
apart from the magnets M1 and M2 by a predetermined
distance.Not only a coil but also an amorphous metal tape is
required for the voice coil 1 shown in Fig. 9.
Therefore, the number of components increases.
Furthermore, an amorphous metal tape is difficult to
obtain and is expensive more than soft magnetic material
such as iron and Permalloy. An amorphous metal tape has
generally a high elastic modulus so that it is difficult
to curl it and make it match the outer circumferential
shape of the voice coil 1.In order to solve the above problems, the prevent
inventors have proposed a loudspeaker such as shown in
Fig. 7. In this loudspeaker, two magnets M1 and M2
magnetized in the thickness direction are disposed with
the same poles being faced each other, and a center plate
P of a disk type made of iron is sandwiched between the
magnets. An outer ring L made of soft magnetic material
F such as iron is disposed outside of the center plate P,
with a predetermined magnetic gap G being formed between
the outer circumference of the center plate P and the
inner circumference of the outer ring L. A voice coil 1
is disposed in the magnetic gap G.The present inventors have also proposed a
loudspeaker such as shown in Fig. 8 in which the outer 
ring L is not used but a voice coil 1 is wound with a
coil containing magnetic material. For example, the coil
may have a core of soft magnetic material F such as iron
and a surface layer of conductive material C such as
copper and aluminum which is adhered to the
