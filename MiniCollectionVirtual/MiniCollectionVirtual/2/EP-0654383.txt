<ABSTRACT>
[Object]
To provide a vehicle controller capable of 
simply and surely changing control data necessary for 

the operation of an engine control unit for starting and 
stopping the engine. 
[Configuration]
A vehicle controller includes an engine 
controller 386 provided with an electric circuit for 

starting and stopping a engine of a vehicle mounted on a 
body frame 302 of the vehicle and a key card 424 that 

controls the operation of the engine in cooperation with 
the engine controller 386. The key card 424 comprises 

an IC card 436 capable of storing all the data necessary 
for the operation of the engine controller 386, and 

receiving generator coils 438 and transmitting 
communication coils 440 as data rewriting means for 

destroying all the control data stored beforehand in the 
engine controller 386 and writing the control data 

stored in the IC card 436 on the engine controller 386.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vehicle
controller comprising an engine control unit provided
with an electric circuit for starting and stopping the
engine of a vehicle, and a key for controlling the
operation of the engine in cooperation with the engine
control unit.In some known vehicle controllers, a mechanical ignition key is used for starting and
stopping the engine of, for example, a motorcycle. When
the engine is started by means of an engine starting
arrangement that is operated with such a mechanical
ignition key, it is possible to start the engine unduly
without using the ignition key. An expensive,
complicated, preventive arrangement is necessary for
preventing undue starting of the engine. Accordingly,
the computerized control of starting and stopping of the
engine has been desired in recent years.Incidentally, ignition timing for timing the
ignition system of an engine is varied according to the
condition and the service condition of the engine and,
therefore, data for the computerized control of ignition
timing stored in a ROM must be changed.An apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open
(Kokai) No. 2-191870 stores adjusting data for changing 
parameters for timing ignition in a data storage means,
changes the adjusting data stored in the data storage
means for new adjusting data transmitted to the data
storage means according to instructions given by a
communicating means.A vehicle controller according to the preamble of
claim 1 is known from GB-A-2252847. GB-A-2252847 describes an engine management system comprising a
removable contactless smart card having an electronic memory
element included therein. At least part of the information
required by a microprocessor for controlling engine function is
held in the token memory. Therefore, the vehicle cannot be
operated without this token. In an embodiment, data representing
a part of a control program is held in the token memory element.The data transferred from the card might be a simple ID code,
basic settings or signals to start the engine or might be
control information which must be accessed continually during
use. For security purposes, each management unit/card
combination may store different parts of the control information
or program in the card memory, so that a card from one vehicle
cannot be used to operate another vehicle having a similar
engine management system.A similar system for furnishing protection against theft of
motor vehicles is described in EP-A-0456916. The system also
comprises a card having a certain data
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A vehicle controller comprising an engine control unit (388) provided
with an electric circuit for starting and stopping an engine of a vehicle

(300) mounted on the body frame (302) of the vehicle, wherein said
vehicle controller comprises a data rewriting means for replacing

engine control data stored beforehand in the engine control unit (388)
with engine control data stored in a storage means (436) of the key

card (424, 600) cooperating with the engine control unit (388),

characterized in that
 said vehicle controller comprises at least two key
cards (424, 600) each of which is adapted to control the operation of

the engine in cooperation with the engine control unit (388) and each
of which comprises said storage means (436) capable of storing engine

control data which are necessary for the operation of the engine
control unit (388) and which comprise ignition timing characteristic

data, air-fuel-mixture control characteristic data, or other engine control
characteristic data,

wherein said engine control data stored in each storage means (436) of
said at least two key cards (424, 600) is different for providing at least

two different modes of operation of the engine.
