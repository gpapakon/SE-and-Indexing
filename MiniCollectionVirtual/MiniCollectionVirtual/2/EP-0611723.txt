<ABSTRACT>
A surface rewinding machine for the formation of 
logs of web material has a winding roller (1) onto which the 

web material (N) is fed. The winding roller has a surface 
portion (1A), extending substantially parallel to the roller 

axis and having a coefficient of friction lower than that of 
the adjoining surface. The web is pressed at preset moments 

by a pusher (3) against that portion of the surface of the 
winding roller having low coefficient of friction so as to 

tear the web material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a surface rewinding machine 
for the formation of logs of web material, such as rolls or 
logs of paper for the production of toilet paper, 
all-purpose wipers and the like, of the type comprising at 
least a winding roller onto which the web material is fed. The invention further refers to a method for the 
production of logs of wound web material, wherein said web 
material is fed around at least a winding roller and wound 
up to form a log and wherein the web material is severed 
after the log is completed with a pre-determined quantity of 
web material. After the severance of the web material, 
winding of a new log is started, all without substantial 
changes in the web material-feeding speed. The invention refers in particular to a new 
apparatus and a new method to carry out the severance or 
tearing of the web material at the end of the winding of 
each log. From EP-A-0 507 749 a rewinding machine is known, 
which provides an arrangement for severing the web at the 
end of each winding cycle. Such arrangement includes a set  
 
of channels in the surface of the main winding roller around 
which the web is fed. The channels cooperate with a 
corresponding arrangement of blades. At pre-selected 
moments, at the end of each winding cycle, the blades are 
moved into the channels, the web material being tensioned 
and eventually torn between one of the blades and the 
relevant channel. Cutting is obtained without mechanical 
contact between blades and winding roller. In order to 
render the apparatus more reliable, two strips of material 
having high coefficient of friction are preferably arranged 
on both sides of the channel arrangement. This avoid 
slipping of the web on the surface of the winding roller. The machine and method of the invention are defined 
in claims 1 and 9 respectively. In practice, the rewinder according to the invention 
is comprising a winding roller having a surface 
portion which extends substantially parallel to the axis of 
the roller and has a coefficient of friction much lower than 
that of the adjoining upstream surface of the roller (with 
respect to the web feeding direction). Means are provided to 
pinch the web at pre-set moments against that portion of the 
winding roller surface having low coefficient of friction. 
By thus pinching or pressing the portion of the web 
material, which is in contact with the winding roller where  
 
the surface has low coefficient of friction, the web can 
easily slide and be stretched beyond its maximum
