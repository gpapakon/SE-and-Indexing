<ABSTRACT>
A heavy duty pneumatic tire comprises a radial carcass 
(1), and a belt comprised of at least three belt layers 

(2, 3, 4), in which a first belt layer (2) contains 
cords inclined at a large cord angle with respect to an 

equatorial plane of the tire and each of a second belt 
layer (3) and a third belt layer (4) contains cords 

inclined at a small cord angle with respect to the 
equatorial plane and cords of the second and third belt 

layers are crossed with each other. In the tire, the 
first belt layer (2) is comprised of steel cords having 

a lxN structure (N: 2-5) and/or each of the second and 
third belt layers (3, 4) is comprised of steel cords 

obtained by twisting 6 sheath steel filaments each 
having a filament diameter of not more than 0.30 mm 

around a single core filament at a twisting angle of not 
more than 6°.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to heavy duty pneumatic
tires, and more particularly to a heavy duty pneumatic
radial tire capable of advantageously attaining
reduction of belt weight.Recently, it has been strongly demanded to improve
fuel consumption in automobiles from a viewpoint of
resource-saving and energy-saving and it is known that
reduction of tire weight largely contributes to
improvement of fuel consumption. As to the reduction
of tire weight, it is effective to reduce the weight
of each member constituting the tire, among which
weight reduction of the belt is particularly effective
because a ratio of the weight of a belt containing rubberized steel
cords to the total weight of the tire is large.A belt reinforcing this type of tire is
comprised of 3-4 belt layers and usually comprises a
first belt layer containing cords inclined at a large
cord angle with respect to an equatorial plane of the
tire and at least two belt layers each arranged outside
the first belt layer in a radial direction of the tire 
and containing cords inclined at a small cord angle with
respect to the equatorial plane, in which the cords of a
second belt layer and a third belt layer are crossed
with each other. As the cord constituting each belt
layer, there are adopted 3+6 structure, 1×12 structure,
3+9+15+1 structure and the like.As a countermeasure for reducing the weight of
the belt, it is effective to decrease the end count of
cords in the belt layer, or to increase the tensile
strength of the steel material to decrease the quantity
of steel used while maintaining the total tenacity of
the belt layer.In these countermeasures, however, the volume
ratio of cords in rubber of the belt layer decreases to
lower the tensile rigidity of the belt. As a result,
the outer diameter of the tire is largely increased at
the time of inflating under an internal pressure or due
to creep phenomenon during the use of the tire to bring
about the occurrence of separation failure at the belt
end or promote uneven wear. Furthermore, lowering
of the tensile rigidity in the belt brings about
decrease of cornering power and degradation of wear
resistance.Attention is also drawn to the disclosure of FR-A-2512747.It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to
provide a belt structure of a heavy duty pneumatic tire 
causing no lowering of belt rigidity in the circumferential
direction even when the total weight of the belt
is decreased by reducing the weight of cords in the belt.According to the invention,
there is provided a heavy duty

carcass (1) toroidally extending between a pair of bead

portions and comprised of at least one carcass ply
containing cords therein, and a belt disposed outside

the carcass in a radial direction of the tire and
comprised of at least three belt layers (2, 3, 4) inclusive of a

belt layer (3) containing cords inclined at a small cord
angle with respect to an equatorial plane of the tire 

and a belt layer (4) containing cords inclined at a
small cord angle in an opposite direction to the

inclination direction of the cords in the former belt
layer (3) with respect to the equatorial plane,

characterized in that each of the above cross belt
layers (3, 4) is comprised of steel cords obtained by

twisting 6 sheath steel filaments each having a filament
diameter of not more than 0.30 mm around a single core

filament at a twisting angle of not more than 6°.
