<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to abrasion-resistant granules composed of one or more inorganic pigments, one or more inorganic elements and/or a compound having a Mohs hardness of at least 7, and one or more inorganic and/or organic binders and optionally frits and/or glasses and/or inorganic fillers, to the preparation thereof, and to the use thereof.

<CLAIMS>
White, black or coloured granular materials for the production of white, black 
or coloured coatings having a high abrasion resistance, characterised in that the granular 

materials have the following composition: 

2 - 40 % by weight
of inorganic colouring bodies, 
20 - 97 % by weight
of one or more inorganic elements and/or compounds with 
a Mohs hardness of at least 7 units, 
1 - 25 % by weight
of one or more inorganic and/or organic binders, 
0 - 50 % by weight
of one or more frits and/or glasses, and 
0 - 40 % by weight
of one or more inorganic fillers. 
A method of producing white, black or coloured granular materials according to 
claim 1, characterised in that the granular material components, excluding the binder(s), 

are ground dry or wet, jointly or separately, or in a suitable combination, to particle 
sizes of 
>
0 to 100 microns, preferably 
>
0 to 40 microns, are dried if wet-grinding is 
used, are thereafter pulverised, are granulated in a granulating unit with one or more 

inorganic and/or organic binders in an amount of 1 to 25 % by weight, preferably 2 to 
15 % by weight, with respect to the solids content, optionally with the addition of water 

or other suitable liquids, and are subsequently calcined between 150째C and 500째C for 
up to 24 hours. 
A method of producing white, black or coloured granular materials according to 
claim 1, characterised in that the granular material components, excluding the binder(s), 

are wet-ground to particle sizes of 
>
0 to 40 microns, are mixed with one or more 
inorganic and/or organic binders in an amount of 1 to 25 % by weight, preferably 2 to 

15 % by weight, with respect to the solids content, optionally with the addition of water, 
the suspension thus obtained is atomised in a spray tower to form granules which are as 

spherical as possible, and the granules are optionally calcined between 150째C and 500째C 
for up to 24 hours.  

 
Use of the white, black or coloured granular materials according to claim 1 in 
the production of abrasion-resistant white or coloured coatings, preferably ceramic 

coatings. 
Use of the white, black or coloured granular materials according to claim 1 for 
colouring lacquers, plastics, ceramic coatings, enamel coatings, glasses or abrasive 

products.
