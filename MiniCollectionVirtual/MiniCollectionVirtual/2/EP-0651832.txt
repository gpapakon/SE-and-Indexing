<ABSTRACT>
A process for delignifying wood pulp characterized by admixing an aqueous solution of chloric acid, containing about 30 percent or greater by weight of HClO3, with a non-oxidizable inorganic acid to produce chlorine dioxide gas containing less than 10 percent by volume of chlorine. The wood pulp, having a consistency of 15 percent or greater, is contacted with the chlorine dioxide gas to delignify the wood pulp. The novel process of the present invention reduces the formation of chloroform and significantly reduces the amounts of toxic by-products such as dioxin and other organic chlorides. These undesirable by-products, collectively identified as absorbable organic halides (AOX), require effluents from pulp bleaching processes to undergo expensive treatment methods to eliminate AOX's prior to discharges to sewers. The effluent discharge from the bleaching process of the present invention has less than 2.0 kg adsorbed organic halides (AOX) per ton of wood pulp.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved
delignifying method for wood pulp and more specifically
to an improved method for gas phase delignifying wood
pulp using chlorine dioxide.Chlorine dioxide has found wide use as a
disinfectant in water treatment/purification, as a
bleaching agent in pulp and paper production, and a
number of other uses because of its high oxidizing
power. There are a number of chlorine dioxide
generator systems and processes available in the
marketplace. Most of the very large scale generators
utilize a chlorate salt, a chloride ion source or
reducing agent, and a strong acid. In the presence of
chloride ion and acid, chlorate ion reacts to produce a
mixture of chlorine and chlorine dioxide. The chlorine
present is an undesired by-product.Many processes have been developed to produce
chlorine dioxide with lower chlorine concentrations by
adding a reducing agent.Reducing agents which have been used include
methanol or other organic compounds, sulfur, sulfur
dioxide or other sulfur-oxygen species having a sulfur
valence of less than +6, and carbon monoxide among
others. When organic compounds are used, unreacted
volatile organics including organic acids are present
in the product gas. Using sulfur containing reducing 
agents, the sulfate or sulfuric acid produced
accumulates as a waste product. When gaseous reducing
agents such as sulfur dioxide or carbon monoxide are
employed, reactor designs and process control systems
must protect against unreacted reducing agent leaving
the system with the chlorine dioxide gas.In addition, prior art processes for the production
of chlorine dioxide from chlorate salts require an
excess of the acid used. This acid is slowly
neutralized by the accumulation of alkali metal ions
that enter the process with the chlorate salt. The
accumulation of salts must be removed as a waste
stream, either liquid or solid, in every process
currently practiced commercially.To avoid the formation of an acidic alkali metal
salt, it has been proposed that chlorine dioxide be
prepared from chloric acid. Chloric acid is, however,
not commercially available. Its preparation has been
taught, for example, in U.S. Patent 3,810,969 issued
May 14, 1974 to A.A. Schlumberger. Schlumberger
teaches a process for producing chloric acid by passing
an aqueous solution containing from 0.2 gram mole to 11
gram moles per liter of an alkali metal chlorate such
as sodium chlorate through a selected cationic exchange
resin at a temperature from 5° to 40° C. The process
produces an

bleaching with chlorine dioxide-containing gas to

delignify said wood pulp, wherein said wood pulp has a
consistency of at least 15 percent characterised in that:


a) said chlorine dioxide-containing gas contains
less than 3% by weight chlorine gas, based on the weight
