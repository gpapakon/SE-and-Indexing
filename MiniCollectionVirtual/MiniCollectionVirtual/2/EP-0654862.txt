<ABSTRACT>
An engagement type connector assembly in which 
the arrangement of terminals is miniaturized. The 

connector assembly includes male and female connectors in 
which the female connector swings about a pair of 

supporting shafts provided at its end so as to be engaged 
with the male connector. The female connector includes a 

female housing and an outer frame. A pair of rotating 
shafts protrudes from the female housing in such a manner 

that the rotating shafts are in parallel with the 
supporting shafts so that the female housing is swingably 

coupled to the outer frame through the rotating shafts. 
That is, the female housing is supported through the 

rotating shaft 18 on the outer frame. Hence, in engaging 
the female connector with the male connector by swinging 

the female connector, the female housing is allowed to 
swing independently of the outer frame, thus being 

correctly aligned with the male housing. Therefore, the 
inlets of the female terminals into which the male 

terminals are inserted may be made more compact. 
Additionally, the electrode spacing interval can be 

reduced commensurately because the female terminals 
engage the male terminals in a non-oblique or 

substantially straight manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an easy engagement type connector
assembly. Especially, the present invention relates
to an engagement type connector assembly and a method of
connecting first and second connectors of said connector
assembly.Connector assemblies having a number of terminals require
a large engaging force. In order to overcome this
difficulty, i.e., to reduce the engaging force as much as
possible, a variety of connector assemblies have been proposed
in the art.An example of the connector assemblies thus proposed is
a so-called "easy" engagement type connector assembly or
turning-engagement type connector assembly, as shown in
FIG. 6. The connector assembly includes a male connector 30
and a female connector 31. The male connector 30 is provided
below a female connector 31. The male connector 30
and the female connector 31 include a male housing 32 and a
female housing 33, respectively, that are engageable with
each other. The male housing 32 has a raised piece 34 on
one side that is integral with the male housing 32. The
raised piece 34 has a recess 36 that is adapted to hold the
supporting shaft 35 of the female connector 31. The supporting
shaft 35 is provided outside the female housing 33.
The supporting shaft 35 is fitted in the recess 36, which
allows the female connector 31 to swing about the supporting
shaft 35, to thereby engage with the male connector 30.
The female housing 33 has a locking piece 37 on the side
that is opposite to the side where the supporting shaft 35
is provided, while the male housing 32 also has a locking
piece 38 on the side that is opposite to the side where the
raised piece 34 is provided.When the male and female connectors 30 and 31 engage,
the locking piece 38 of the female connector 31 is engaged 
with the locking edge 42 of the locking piece 37 of the
male connector 30, to lock the male and female connectors
to each other.This conventional engagement type connector assembly
suffers from several problems. That is, in the conventional
connector assembly, the female housing 33 is aligned with
the male housing 32 while describing an arcuate locus, that
is, the female terminals 39 approach the male terminals 40
obliquely from above. Therefore, in order to smoothly engage
the female terminals with the male terminals, the female
terminals 39 must have inlets 41 (Fig. 7) that are
widely opened for insertion of the male terminals 40. Accordingly,
in the conventional connector assembly, the female
terminals 39 require large amounts of space between
each electrode,

<CLAIMS>
An engagement type connector assembly comprising a
male connector (1) and a female connector (4) that are engageable

with each other, a first of the male (1) and female
connectors (4) having a supporting shaft (9) at an end

portion of the first connector, a second of the male (1)
and female connectors (4) having a recess (10) in which the

supporting shaft (9) is engaged so that the first connector
is swingable about the supporting shaft (9) to engage the

second connector, wherein the first connector comprises an
outer frame (14) on which the supporting shaft (9) is

mounted, and a housing (13) that is swingably supported on
the outer frame (14) by a rotating shaft (18) that is substantially
