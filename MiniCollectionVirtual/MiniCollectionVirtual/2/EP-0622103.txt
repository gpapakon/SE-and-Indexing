<ABSTRACT>
Filter media used for removing foreign matter from 
an air stream flowing therethrough, which includes a pair of 

first and second generally flat sheets of filtering material 
extending in generally parallel relation to one another with 

a spacing therebetween. The first and second sheets are 
each formed with a plurality of dimples extending, 

respectively, inwardly toward the other of the sheets for 
abutment therewith to maintain the spacing between the 

sheets, and the dimples in one of the sheets are spaced from 
one another along the extending length thereof and are also 

spaced from the corresponding dimples in the other sheet, 
with such spacing preferably being equal. Also, adjacent 

pairs of such filter media sheets are arranged so that the 
dimples in the facing surfaces of adjacent pairs are offset 

from one another whereby clumps of foreign matter do not 
tend to collect and become anchored in opposed crevices 

formed by the dimples.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to filter
media construction, particularly construction wherein the
filter media has a generally flat configuration for use in
panel filters or any similar application where flat filter
surfaces are required.In a typical conventional flat filter media
construction, a series of pairs of generally flat sheets of
a suitable filtering material (e.g. paper) are mounted in
spaced, parallel relation to one another to leave a spacing
between the facing surfaces of each such pair of sheets, and
the two sheets in each such pair are also spaced from one
another to provide an interior spacing therebetween. An air
stream having foreign matter entrained therein is caused to
flow into the spacings between adjacent pairs of filter
sheets, then inwardly through the facing surfaces of each
adjacent pair of filter sheets to the interior spacing
thereof, whereby the foreign matter is deposited on such
facing surfaces, and the cleaned air is caused to flow away
from the interior spacing of each pair of sheets.Because the sheets of filter media are generally
made of a flexible material such as paper, and because the
aforesaid air flow through the filter media creates a
pressure drop across the sheets, the two sheets in each pair
of sheets tend to collapse toward one another, which can
reduce or even eliminate the required spacing therebetween
that forms the aforesaid clean air interior area between the
sheets. Similarly, since each pair of sheets is located in
close proximity to the adjacent pairs, the flexing movement 
of the filter media can also result in a significant
reduction in the aforesaid spacing between the facing
surfaces of adjacent pairs of filter sheets thereby reducing
the size of the area between the pairs of filter sheets that
is necessary for receiving the dirty air with entrained
foreign matter.To avoid these problems, conventional filter media
constructions (US-A-2 945 559) incorporate in each of the filter media sheets
a plurality of dimples or indentations that are arranged in
a predetermined pattern to maintain the desired spacing not
only between the two sheets in each pair, but also the
facing sheets of adjacent pairs. More specifically, the two
sheets in each pair both include inwardly directed dimples,
and the dimples in both sheets are located directly opposite
one another so that if the two sheets tend to collapse
toward one another, the opposed dimples can abut one another
and maintain the desired spacing between the sheets.
Similarly, the outwardly

<CLAIMS>
Filter media for use in removing foreign matter from
an air stream flowing therethrough, said filter media comprising

pairs of first and second generally flat sheets (32,
34) of filtering material extending in generally parallel relation

to one another with a spacing therebetween, whereby
said air stream can flow through said first and second sheets

(32, 34) to said spacing (36) therebetween while depositing
said foreign matter on the outwardly facing surfaces of said

first and second sheets (32, 34), said first and second
sheets each being formed with a plurality of dimples (38)

spaced from one another and extending, respectively, inwardly
toward the other of said sheets for abutment therewith to

maintain said spacing (36) between said sheets (32, 34) characterized
in that all dimples (38) extend inwardly to the

other of the sheets (32, 34) and in that the dimples (38) of
the first sheet (32) are offset from the dimples (38) of the

other sheet (34) such that the dimples (38) abut the flat inner
surface of the opposite sheet. 
Filter media as defined in claim 1 wherein
each of said dimples (38) in said first sheet (32) are spaced an equal

distance from the dimples (38) in said second sheet (34).
Filter media as defined in claim 1, wherein
another pair (B) of said first and second sheets (32, 34) of filter
ing
material substantially identical to said first pair are

disposed in spaced, parallel relation to said first pair (A) to
provide a dirty air channel between the facing surfaces of

said two pairs of sheets, and wherein said dimples (38) in said
facing surfaces of one of said pairs of sheets are offset

from the dimples (38) in the other of said pairs of sheets in a
direction along the extending length thereof whereby the 

crevices formed by the dimples (38) in one facing surface are not
opposite the corresponding dimples (38) in the other facing

surface.
