<ABSTRACT>
Compositions of matter comprising   a) a macromolecular organic material in the form of a coating or printing ink, and b) a pigment composition consisting of an organic pigment whose particle surface has been coated with a firmly adhering coating of alkyl silicate which is fixed by adsorption of an alkyl silicate on a layer which encloses the particle surface and which consists essentially of partially hydrolysed organic compounds of elements of group 4A or 4B of the Periodic Table selected from the group consisting of chelates of the formula

 where R1 is methyl, ethyl, methoxy or ethoxy, R2 is methyl or ethyl and R3 is halogen or C1-C4-alkoxy and M is Ti or Sn, and of esters of the formula  M1(OR4)4  (III), where M1 is an element of group 4A or 4B of the Periodic Table are R4 is C1-C4-alkyl, the alkyl silicate being hydrolysed before, during or after the adsorption.   The colourings obtained therewith are notable for a surprisingly good lustre. The pigment compositions b) are notable for excellent rheology.
