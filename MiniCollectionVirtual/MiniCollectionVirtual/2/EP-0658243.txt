<ABSTRACT>
Signal lamps, in particular for motor vehicles, have a light source, a housing and a transparent coloured closure, preferably red, as well as one or several light filters arranged between the light source and the closure face. In order to obtain on the one hand a more intensive colouring of the closure when the light source is switched off, and to reduce, on the other hand, light losses, the closure has a continuous colouring, is subdivided into segments of different thicknesses and the light filter is provided with recesses.

A signal lamp, in particular, for automotive vehicles, 
comprising a light source, a casing including a closure 

plate (6) of transparent colouring, preferably red, and 
comprising one or more light filters (5) provided between 

the light source and the closure plate (6), wherein the 
closure plate (6) is subdivided into segments (13 and 14) of 

varying plate thicknesses (d,D),
characterized
 in that the light filter (5) is 
provided with recesses (7). 
A signal lamp as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the recesses (7) of the 
light filter (5) are provided within the path of rays ahead 

of the segments (14) having a high plate thickness (D). 
A signal lamp as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 in that the segments (13 and 14) 
of varying plate thicknesses have different widths (b,B), 

with especially segments (13) having low plate thicknesses 
(D) being designed narrower than the segments (14) having 

high plate thicknesses (D). 
A signal lamp as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 in that at least one lens system 
(17) is provided between the light filter (5) and the 

closure plate (6). 
A signal lamp as claimed in claim 4,
characterized
 in that the lens system (17) is 
formed of lenses (16) arranged on the segments (14) of high  

 
plate thickness (D), with the lenses (16) and the segments 

(14) being preferably formed integrally. 
A signal lamp as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 in that a lens system (11) is 
provided between the light source and the light filter (5). 
A signal lamp as claimed in claim 6,
characterized
 in that the lens system (11) is 
formed of lenses (10) provided on the light filter (5), with 

the lenses (10) and the light filter (5) being preferably 
formed integrally. 
A signal lamp as claimed in claim 6 or claim 7,
characterized
 in that the lens system (11) 
comprises recesses in an area of the recesses (7) of the 

light filter (5). 
A signal lamp as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 8,
characterized
 in that the lens system (11 and 
17, respectively) is formed of convex and/or concave lenses 

(10 and 16, respectively). 
A signal lamp as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 9,
characterized
 in that the light of the light 
source is refracted either by the lens system (11) 

associated with the light filter (5) or by the lens system 
(17) associated with the closure plate (6).  

 
A signal lamp as claimed in any one of claims 6 to 10,
characterized
 in that the focal points (12) of 
the lens system (11) associated with the light filter (5) 

are within the area of the segments (13) of low plate 
thickness (d), preferably on the inner or outer surface of 

the closure plate (6). 
A signal lamp as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 11,
characterized
 in that the focal points of the 
lens system (17) associated with the closure plate (6) are 

in spaced relationship to an outer surface of the closure 
plate (6). 
A signal lamp as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the distance (A) of the 
light filter (5) from an inner surface of the closure plate 

(6) is different with varying signal colours. 
A signal lamp as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that a desired signal colour 
can be generated by a colour subtraction and a subsequent 

colour addition.
