<ABSTRACT>
A battery using carbonaceous materials with a 
graphite or disordered graphite structure wherein boron 

atoms are substituted for carbon atoms in the structure. 
The electrochemical potential of the carbonaceous materials 

is shifted as a result of such substitution, and the electrochemical 
capacity is increased. Both effects are 

desirable for anode materials in lithium ion type batteries.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of batteries. 
In particular, it deals with anode materials useful for 
rechargeable lithium ion batteries. Rechargeable lithium batteries are becoming 
increasingly more common in the market place. This is a 
result of greater demand for higher energy density power 
sources for electronics applications and of recent improvements 
in the technology. A new type of battery based on 
lithium ion (also referred to as "rocking chair") technology 
was recently made commercially available by Sony Energy 
Tec (T. Nagaura et al., Progress in Batteries and Solar 
Cells, 9, 209, (1990)). This system uses two, suitably 
chosen, intercalation compounds as electrodes each of which 
acts as a host for lithium. It is thus desirable to select 
materials that are capable of reversibly intercalating 
large amounts of lithium per unit host material. Since the 
battery voltage is determined by the potential difference 
between the two electrodes, it is desirable to select two 
materials that differ significantly in potential. Typically, the cathode in such systems is a 
lithium transition metal oxide such as LiCoO₂ (Goodenough et 
al., U.S. Patent No. 4,302,518) or LiMn₂O₄ (Thackeray et 
al., U.S. Patent No. 4,507,371). These materials reversibly 
intercalate lithium in a potential range around 3 to 
4 volts with respect to lithium metal. The anode material 
employed is typically a carbonaceous material with a 
graphite or disordered graphite structure. These materials 
reversibly intercalate lithium in a potential range mainly  
 
within a few hundred millivolts above that of lithium 
metal. The use of graphite as an anode material has been 
disclosed previously in inventions by Sanyo (Japanese 
published examined patent application No. 87023433) and by 
Basu (U.S. Patent No. 4,423,125) amongst others. Highly 
crystalline graphite offers large theoretical reversible 
lithium capacity. Herein, we define reversible capacity as 
the amount of lithium, Δx, in Lix+ΔxC₆ which can be reversibly 
intercalated over many cycles. It is commonly believed 
that pure graphite can reversibly intercalate Δx = 
1 worth of lithium. This corresponds to 372 mAh/g capacity 
for the graphite. Although graphite has excellent capacity properties, 
difficulties are encountered in its practical 
application in lithium ion cells. Lithium in all carbonaceous 
hosts is lost to some extent. This loss of lithium 
is irreversible, hence it is important that it be minimized. 
The mechanism for all the losses observed
