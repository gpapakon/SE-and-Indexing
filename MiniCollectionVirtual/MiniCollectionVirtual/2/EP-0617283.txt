<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the measurement of 
adenyl group-containing substances. More particularly, it 
relates to a method in which adenyl group in a substance to be 
measured is chemically modified and the substance is measured 
qualitatively or quantitatively using chemiluminescent activity 
of the modified substance as a marker. Adenine, adenosine, adenosine phosphate compounds, DNA, RNA 
and the like are known as adenyl group-containing substances 
which take important roles in a living body as composing 
elements of coenzymes, high-energy phosphate compounds, genes 
and the like. In general, measurement of adenine and adenosine is carried 
out with the aid of complicated high performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC), because they cannot be separated for the 
measurement from other nucleic acid bases such as guanine, 
guanosine and the like without employing chromatographic 
separation techniques. On the other hand, measurement of nucleic acids is carried 
out generally making use of their ultraviolet absorption at 260 
nm, but such a method has problems with regard to its measuring 
sensitivity and specificity. In recent years, an ethidium 
bromide-aided fluorochrome technique has been developed. This 
technique, however, can hardly be used for accurate quantitative 
determination of nucleic acids because the fluorescent intensity  
 
fluctuates extensively depending on the difference in three-dimensional 
structures of nucleic acids. In addition, it 
requires special treatment in handling because ethidium bromide 
is a strong carcinogenic substance. Kuroda et al. present that it is possible of quantitative 
measurement for adenine by reacting phenyl glyoxal (PG) with 
adenine to induce luminescent substance and to emit luminescence 
by adding NaOH to the luminescent substance at the presence of 
H₂O₂ at the 41st meeting for Nihon Bunsekikagakkai. Although 
this method was useful because of its specificity against 
adenine, there were problems that the luminescent intensity per 
an adenine is low and the luminescent intensity of control is 
relatively high in the absence of adenine. It is accordingly an object of the present invention to 
measure adenyl group-containing substances by simple means with 
high specificity and sensitivity. The inventors of the present invention have found a new 
measuring method in which a chemiluminescent substance is 
derived by allowing a compound (reactable with adenyl group) 
represented by the following general formula 1 to react with the 
adenyl
