<ABSTRACT>
A PLL circuit for a phase comparator, a low-pass 
filter (LPF), a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) and 

a frequency divider. A first control circuit is responsive 
to a discontinuous phase change of a reference signal of 

the PLL circuit for inhibiting the operation of the phase 
comparator or disconnecting the LPF from the phase 

comparator during a predetermined period so that the 
discontinuous phase change information is not transmitted 

through the LPF to the VCO. At the same time, a second 
control circuit resets the frequency divider by a pulse 

of the reference signal after the discontinuous phase change 
or applies a voltage corresponding to the discontinuous 

phase change to the VCO so that the output signal of the 
frequency divider is locked in phase to the reference 

signal after the discontinuous phase change. With the 
cooperation of the first and second control circuits, the 

PLL circuit quickly recovers its stable state after the 
discontinuous phase change of the reference signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a phase locked loop (PLL) 
circuit, and more particularly to a PLL circuit applied 
with an input signal which would often cause discontinuous 
changes in phase. A digital signal processing circuit such as a time-base 
collector (TBC) in a video tape recorder (VTR) uses 
a memory for temporarily storing a digital video signal as 
shown in FIG. 1. Referring to FIG. 1, a digital video 
signal is written into a memory 51 in response to a write 
clock and the stored digital video signal is read out from 
the memory 51 in response to a read clock. The address of 
the memory 51 is reset periodically, for example at 
intervals of horizontal scanning period (H), by a reset 
signal. Used as the reset signal is a reference signal d 
which is a periodic pulse train as shown in FIG. 2 produced 
from the horizontal synchronizing signal or the burst 
signal of the video signal reproduced via a pair of rotary 
heads from a recording tape. The write clock is generated 
from the reference signal by a PLL circuit 50 comprising  
 
a phase comparator 2, a low-pass filter (LPF) 3, a voltage 
controlled oscillator (VCO) 4 and a frequency divider 5. 
The PLL circuit 50 operates so that the phase of the 
output signal e of the frequency divider 5 is locked to 
the phase of the reference signal d. The response speed 
of the PLL circuit 50 which is determined by the time 
constant of the LPF 3 cannot be made too short so that the 
PLL circuit 50 does not respond to a noise. The PLL circuit 50 arranged as above cannot immediately 
recover the stable state when the reference signal d 
causes a discontinuous change in phase. Since the video 
signal recorded on the recorded tape is reproduced via a 
pair of alternately switched heads, there would be caused 
a discontinuity of the reproduced signal, resulting in 
a sudden change of the phase of the reference signal. 
Referring to FIG. 2, HSW is the head switching signal for 
periodically changing over the pair of heads, and the 
reference signal causes a discontinuous phasechange between 
pulses d₁ and d₂. The phase comparator 2 generates an 
error signal g corresponding to the phase difference 
between the reference signal d and the output signal e of 
the frequency divider 5. The frequency divider 5 resets 
itself by the reset signal f synchronized with the signal 
e. Due to the time constant of the LPF 3, the error 
signal g is converted by the LPF 3 to a gradually changing  
 
voltage signal h. Therefore, it takes a fairly long time 
(about 10H in the
