<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a system for measuring a quantity of compressed gas supplied under a high pressure from a first tank to a second tank. The invention makes it possible to measure, directly and without calculation, the volume which this supplied gas would occupy under standard temperature and pressure conditions.

<CLAIMS>
A metering system (10) for metering a quantity of compressed gas
supplied under high pressure from a first tank (16) via a first duct

(20) to a second tank (18), characterized in that said metering
system (10) includes:


a second duct (30) fed by the first tank (16) and branching
from the first duct (20);
means for physically reducing to standard conditions the
quantity of gas supplied that passes into the second duct (20);
means (32) for measuring said quantity of gas;
a constriction (26) of inside diameter of the first duct (20)
after the bifurcation of the second duct (30); and
a constriction (28) of inside diameter of the second duct
(30).
A metering system (10) according to claim 1, characterized in that
the constriction (26) in the first duct (20) is located in an

integrated Venturi nozzle.
A metering system (10) according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the constriction (28) in the second duct (30) forms a portion of

a Venturi nozzle.
A metering system (10) according to any one of claims 1, 2, or 3,
characterized in that the pressure p of the gas after the

constriction (26) in the first duct (20) is less than 95% of the
pressure P before said constriction (26).
