<ABSTRACT>
A method for concentrating the overspray, arising in spray booths having wet washing, of one-component water-based paints by nanofiltration with membranes having an exclusion limit of 200 to 2000 g/mol at pressures of 12 to 40 bar, and use of the permeate arising in this as booth water and of the retentate arising as paint or as constituent of a new paint batch.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the concentration of the overspray of 
one-component water-based coatings arising in spray 

booths with wet scrubbing, characterized in that the 
overspray diluted by the water of the spray booth is 

concentrated by a nanofiltration using membranes 
having a cut-off of 200 to 2000 g/mol at pressures of 

12 to 40 bar. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the overspray diluted by the water of the spray booth 

is concentrated by a nanofiltration using membranes 
having a cut-off of 200 to 1000 g/mol at pressures of 

15 to 30 bar. 
A process according to claim 1 and 2, characterized in 
that deionized water is used as booth water. 
A process according to claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that to improve the permeate flow water-soluble, mono- or 

dihydric alcohols, optionally having ether bridges, 
are added to the booth water to a glycol derivative in 

an amount of up to 20 wt.% relative to the weight of 
the water. 
A process according to claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that the pH value is continuously monitored during the 

nanofiltration and a fall in the pH value is 
compensated for by the addition of amines. 
The use as booth water of the permeate arising during 
the process according to claims 1 to 5.  

 
The use as coating or as constituent of a new batch of 
coating of the retentate arising during the process 

according to claims 1 to 5.
