<ABSTRACT>
Different multi-bit addresses extending from a stating 
address to an ending address are sequentially assigned to respective 

memory segments in a designated area of a memory which stores 
data. A fixed-value register stores fixed-value data representative of 

a predetermined unit address increment, and outputs the fixed-value 
data. A multi-bit adder adds output data from an address 

pointer register and the output fixed-value data from the fixed-value 
register, and outputs data representative of a result of the addition. 

The address pointer register stores starting-address data 
representative of the starting address and outputs the starting-address 

data to the memory and the adder during an initial stage. 
The address pointer register stores the output data from the adder 

and outputs the stored data to the memory and the adder during a 
stage following the initial stage. The adder includes adding circuit 

elements corresponding to respective bits. In the adder, 

propagation of a carry from a given one of the adding circuit 
elements to a subsequent one of the adding circuit elements is 

inhibited so that an address represented by the output data from the 
adder returns from the ending address to the starting address when 

an address represented by the output data from the address pointer 
register reaches the ending address.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and a system for address 
access which are usable in a digital signal processor. Some types of digital signal processing include a step of 
iteratively accessing a designated area of a memory. During such a 
step, memory segments in the designated area are sequentially and 
cyclically accessed in response to an address signal. The memory 
segments in the designated area have sequential addresses 
respectively. During the above-indicated step, an address pointer 
system generates a signal (an address signal) representing an 
address which is periodically incremented from a starting address 
to an ending address in the designated area of the memory. The 
address signal is fed to the memory to execute an access to the 
memory segment having the corresponding address. After the 
address represented by the address signal reaches the end 
address, it is reset to the starting address. Then, periodic 
incrementing of the address is repeated. As will be described later, prior-art address pointer systems 
tend to be complicated in structure. It is an object of this invention to provide an improved 
method of address access.  It is another object of this invention to provide an improved 
system for address access. A first aspect of this invention provides a method of accessing 
a given address region which comprises the steps of updating a 
value of an address pointer for accessing a portion of the given 
address region; using the value of the address pointer and a given 
increment in calculation for said updating; and controlling a carry in 
said calculation to provide cyclic change of an accessed address. A second aspect of this invention provides an address access 
apparatus comprising an adder for updating an address pointer, and 
for controlling a carry caused in said updating; and a register for 
storing said address pointer. A third aspect of this invention provides an apparatus for 
accessing a designated area in a memory which stores data, wherein 
different multi-bit addresses extending from a starting address to an 
ending address are sequentially assigned to respective memory 
segments in the designated area, the apparatus comprising an 
address pointer register; a fixed-value register for storing fixed-value 
data representative of a predetermined unit address 
increment and outputting the fixed-value data; and a multi-bit adder 
for adding output data from the address pointer register and the 
output fixed-value data from the fixed-value register, and outputting 
dat
