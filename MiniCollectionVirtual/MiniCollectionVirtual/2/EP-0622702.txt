<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (100) for sensing the presence or an edge of a sheet, including a light 
emitter (103), a set of reflectors (101,102,106,107) and at least one light detecting member. A 

light beam is reflected between the emitter (103) and detector (110,111) in a repeating wave 
form so as to intersect a sheet path; interruption of the light beam indicates the presence of a 

sheet. False indications of the presence, absence or true edge of the sheet such as may be 
caused by sheet holes or edge irregularities are avoided by the multiple passes of a beam of 

light across the path of the sheet. A continuous cleaning action of the sensor (110,111) may be 
provided by the movement of the sheet over the light emitters (103), light detectors (110,111) 

and/or reflectors (101,102,106,107). The sheet sensors are useful in detecting and/or correcting 
sheet skew, misregistration and other potential sheet handling problems. Through the use of 

optic fibers (Fig. 5), wires or other means, the light emitter(s) and light detectors that may 
service a network of sheet sensors positioned throughout a copying or printing machine (Fig. 

11) which may be centralized and otherwise assembled in efficient modularized configurations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to sheet handling devices, and more particularly
concerns an apparatus and method for correctly sensing the leading edge, the trailing edge
and/or presence of a sheet so as to avoid sheet handling errors that might otherwise occur as a
result of pre-drilled sheet holes, tears and other variances in a sheet surface, or that might
occur as a result of sheet skew, misalignment, misregistration, paper jams or other sheet
handling situations.Xerographic reproduction and printing machines utilize sheet handling devices
which often incorporate a number of sensors to monitor sheet presence, edge location,
dimensions, alignment, registration, jamming and other conditions relating to sheets passing
through such machines. Extensive arrays of such sensors are being incorporated into
technologically advanced machines to increase their capabilities and reliability, and to prevent
hazardous conditions and/or damage to machines that may be caused by sheet jamming or
other problems. Perhaps most notably, sheet sensors can eliminate numerous preparation and
instruction input tasks formerly required of operators. The employment of compact and
reliable single and multi-function sensors that can be used more than one location in a machine
can further enhance the capabilities of such machines, while offering important manufacturing and
repair cost advantages and cost savings.Sheet presence, alignment and edge detection systems have heretofore existed
which make use of light emitters and receptors. An important drawback to many such sensors
is their inability to correctly "ignore" sheet holes, folded corners or other surface and edge
irregularities so as to eliminate sheet and edge sensing false alarms. Elaborate computer
programs have been developed to utilize "spot" sensors, which may employ one or two light
beams in close proximity to each other generally positioned at a corner of a passing sheet, as
well as other sensor configurations that are only able to provide information from a small cross
sectional area. In many situations (such as edge detection in predrilled paper sheets), such
programs must use such corner/spot sensors to "predict" (rather than know) where the lead
edge and/or trail edge of a sheet may lie. For example, when a spot or corner sensor is first
triggered by the lead edge of a sheet, the program may be set so as to permit at least 8 inches
(20cm) of an 8 1/2 inch (21.3cm) sheet (moving at a constant or variable velocity) to pass by the
spot sensor before the program
