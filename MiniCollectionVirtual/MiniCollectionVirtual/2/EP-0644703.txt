<ABSTRACT>
Mobile equipment for a cellular telephone system has its 
software modified so that the equipment can restore to 

usability a SIM card in a locked state. The software 
detects if a datafield on the SIM card can be read, 

detects if an unreadable datafield can be written to and, 
if it can, writes initial information into the unreadable 

datafield to restore the SIM card to usability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to mobile equipment for cellular
radio telephony networks, such as GSM, and to a method of
operating such equipment.A cellular radio telephony system has a plurality of base
stations serving geographical areas called "cells" and a
plurality of mobile handsets (or mobile stations) carried
by subscribers to the system. Each mobile station
comprises mobile equipment (ME) and a component which
carries the identity of the subscriber and other
subscriber related information. This component is called
a SIM (subscriber identity module) card. The SIM card is
a smart card either having the format of a credit card or
it may alternatively be made to a smaller format, called
plug-in SIM. The SIM card is frequently but not
invariably removable from the mobile equipment. The SIM
card contains the international mobile subscriber identity
(IMSI) which unambiguously identifies a subscriber.
Without a valid IMSI, telephone service is not accessible,
apart from emergency calls. A typical SIM card consists
of the card itself, edge connectors on the card for
electrically connecting the card to the mobile equipment
and a chip. The chip includes a microprocessor, a program
memory, temporary memory and non-volatile memory. All
data which must be retained when power is switched off in
the mobile equipment is stored in the non-volatile memory 
in the SIM cad.All data accessible from the mobile equipment is stored in datafields in the SIM card. The
datafields holding temporary memory may become inaccessible to the mobile equipment.
with the result that the SIM card assumes a locked state, if for example:
a) the SIM card is removed from the mobile equipment during update of a
datafield. This is possible because such updating can occur without the
subscriber knowing that it is happening and because there is no mechanical
interlock preventing withdrawal of the SIM card from the mobile
equipment.b) a power failure occurs during an update; for example due to low battery
power, resulting in only partial updating of a datafield. Hitherto, if a SIM
card has assumed such a locked state it has been unusable and it has been
necessary to dispose of it and replace it with a new SIM card.The invention aims to restore to usability a SIM card which is in a locked state.WO-A-91/12698 discloses a cellular radio telephone system where subscribers are
equipped with SIM cards each of which not only uniquely identifies the subscriber but also
contains customised data, so that when the SIM card is inserted in a radio telephone,

<CLAIMS>
Mobile equipment for a cellular telephone system, the equipment having first means
for detecting (18) if a datafield on a SIM card can be read, second means for detecting

(22) if an unreadable datafield can be written to and third means for writing (26) initial
information into said unreadable datafield in the event of the second means detecting that

the unreadable datafield can be written to.
Mobile equipment according to claim 1, wherein the initial information corresponds
to the information in that datafield when the SIM card is obtained from the system

operator.
Mobile equipment according to claim 1 or 2, and in combination with a SIM card.
Mobile equipment according to claim 3, wherein said datafield is one of a plurality of
datafields which can be written to on the SIM card.
A method of restoring to usability a SIM card which is in a locked state as a result of
having an unreadable datafield, comprising the steps of detecting (18) if a datafield on the

SIM card can be read from associated mobile equipment, detecting (22) if an unreadable
datafield can be written to and, if it can, writing (26) initial information into said datafield.
