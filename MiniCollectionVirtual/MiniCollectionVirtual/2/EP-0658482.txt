<ABSTRACT>
A dispensing closure is provided for a container (22) and 
includes a base (24) for being mounted to the container over 

the container opening. An actuator (60) is mounted on the 
base (24) and is tiltable between a closed position and an 

open position. A ring (25) is mounted on the base (24) for 
rotation relative to the base (24) and actuator (60). The 

ring (25) and base (24) together cooperatively define a cam 
drive means (131, 151; 132, 152) for effecting the tilting 

of the actuator (60).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dispensing closure for a container 
according to the preamble of claim 1. A dispensing closure of this type is known from WO-A-89/03363. 
Said known dispensing closure comprises a base for being 
mounted to a container at an opening thereto. Said base is 
restraint against rotation relative to said container during 
normal operation of said closure and defines a discharge 
passage for communicating with the container opening. An 
actuator is carried by said base. Two fixed pivot projections 
of said actuator define part of a hinge. The pivot projections 
are transversely located in the sense of being directly on a 
diameter of the closure which passes through the pivot 
projections and also directly through the axis of a vertical 
discharge passage to mount said actuator on said base to 
accommodate tilting of said actuator between a closed position 
occluding said discharge passage and an open position 
permitting flow out of said discharge passage. Restraint means 
are provided on said base for preventing substantial relative 
rotational movement between said base and actuator about a 
central axis. A ring is mounted on said base for rotation 
relative to said base and actuator about said central axis. 
Said ring and actuator together cooperatively define cam drive 
means for effecting said tilting of said actuator. While the tiltable actuator within a rotatable collar as 
disclosed in said reference may function generally 
satisfactorily for the purpose for which it was designed, it 
would be desirable to provide an improved dispensing closure  
 
with structural and operational advantages. Specifically, it would be desirable to provide a cam drive 
system that could be located in a relatively small region of 
the closure and that would not require extensive 
circumferential cam tracks around all or most of the closure. Further, it would be advantageous if the components of such an 
improved design could be relatively easily manufactured and 
readily assembled. Additionally, it would be beneficial if such an improved 
design could provide a "high-style" exterior configuration 
substantially free from functional details and instructional 
nomenclature or indicia. The present invention provides an improved closure which can 
accommodate designs having the above-discussed benefits and 
features. The present invention provides an improved closure in 
accordance with the characterizing portion of claim 1 which 
can accommodate designs having the above-discussed benefits 
and
