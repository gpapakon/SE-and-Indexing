<ABSTRACT>
A device for suppressing noise emission from a vibrating line, the device comprising means for at least partially cladding the line in a jacket of sound-absorbing material (2, 3), the jacket having an interior surface conforming to the contour of the line and spaced a predetermined distance from the line whereby the jacket is isolated (8) from the vibrating line and absorbs sound waves emitted by the line. The device is particularly suitable for use in suppressing noise emissions from railway lines. The device allows unimpeded passage of the wheel along the line.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NOISE SUPPRESSION SYSTEMS This invention relates to a noise suppression system for reducing noise emitted by a vibrating rail or line, particularly a railway line, and for reducing noise emanating from a wheel/rail interface.It is known to reduce the impact noise emissions from railway lines by erecting fencing alongside such lines. This is costly and generally unsightly. It is therefore preferable to reduce the emission of noise at the track itself.DE-A-3840959 discloses a method of sound insulating the tracks by the use of reinforced rubber sound absorbing elements running the continuous length of the rail. The elements are retained by bolts welded to the web of the rail. This increases the cost of new track considerably and is also expensive to fit to existing track.DE-A-3824577 discloses the use of a soft foam strip releasably secured to the rail web. Although being low-cost and simple to apply, such strips would appear generally ineffective and to have only a short life.DE-A-3939215 discloses a two-part longitud nal soundproofing element of polyurethane and lead which is fixed to opposing sides of the rail, the upper portion being fixed to the lower portion by steel rods and pins.DE-A-4000992 discloses synthetic rubber dampers extending along both sides of a rail and held against the ra l by spring clamps.The above publications are generally concerned with suppressing noise by damping the vibrations of the rail. In most cases, the damping element is secured in contact with the rail and will therefore vibrate with it. While this may produce some reduction in the amplitude of the vibrations, it can never eliminate the noise completely.In one alternative Known arrangement, slabs of sound-absorbing material 

are placed along the track between the two rails and along each side of the track such that each rail effectively lies within a sound-absorbing duct. This not only uses large quantities of sound-absorbing material but the slabs must be lifted and relai each time the track is maintained by tamping the underlying substrate.According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a device for reducing noise emission from a vibrating line, the device comprising means for at least partially cladding the line in a jacket of sound absorbing material, the jacket having an interior surface spaced a predetermined distance from the line whereby the jacket is isolated from the vibrating line and absorbs sound waves emitted by the 1ine.Preferably, the interior surface of the jacket substantially

CLAIMS
1. A device for suppressing noise emission from a vibrating line, the device comprising means for at least partially cladding the line in a jacket of sound-absorbing material, the jacket having an interior surface spaced a predetermined distance from the line whereby the jacket is isolated from the vibrating line and absorbs sound waves emitted by the 1 ine.
2. A device according to claim 1 wherein the interior surface of the jacket substantially conforms to the contour of the line.
3. A device according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the line comprises a railway line and a portion of the jacketed line remains accessible to allow unimpeded passage of a wheel along the line.
4. A device according to claim 1, 2 or 3 further comprising means for releasably securing the cladding to the line.
5. A device according to claim 4 in which the releasable securing means includes a resilient clamping mechanism.
6. A device according to claim 5 in which the resilient clamping mechanism includes a plurality of spring clips longitudinally spaced along the line.
7. A device according to any one of the preceding claims in which vibration isolating spacers are inserted between the line and the interior surface of the cladding.
8. A device according to claim 7 in which the spacers are in the form of longitudinally spaced elongate resilient strips adhered to the 1 ine.
9. A device according to claim 7 or claim 8 in which the spacers are formed of rubber or a mastic material. 


10. A device according to any one of the preceding claims in which the sound absorbing material is a wood fibre concrete.
11. A device according to claim 7 in which the sound absorbing material is aerated rubber and the spacers are integrally moulded as part of the interior surface of the cladding.
12. A device according to claim 3 in which the railway line profile includes a head portion connected to a foot portion by a web portion, and the cladding consists of discrete components respectively assembled on opposing sides of the rail web below the head portion.
13. A device according to claim 12 in which one of the side components positioned on the outside of the railway track includes a limb which extends upwardly above the head portion of the rail to provide a fence or barrier for reducing noise emanating from the wheel of a train.
14. A method of reducing the emission of noise from a vibrating line, particularly a railway line, the method comprising at least partially cladding the line in a jacket of sound absorbing material and isolating the jacket from the vibrations of the line whereby the jacket absorbs sound waves emitted by the vibrating line.
15. A railway line fitted with a noise suppression device according to any one of the claims 1-13.
16. A device according to any one of the claims 1-13 and substantially as herein described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
