<ABSTRACT>
The spatial structural prefabricated element is the 
result of the formation by means of folding, molding or 

extruding of polygon surfaces limited by edges which coincide 
with the linear elements of which the spatial structures are 

composed, in such a way that the basis of the pyramids 
(normal or inverted), are closed by means of plates or 

continuous flat
 

meshes made with an adequate material. 
The prefabricated element is a rigid body, sandwich type 
with a high resistance to stress, bending and sagging and 

with an inner texture which corresponds to the texture of a 
spatial structure with embodied inner faces. 
The prefabricated element can be obtained from a wide 
variety of materials and the application fields are: 

industry, engineering, building and even agriculture to make 
forging, walls, insulation panels, floating items, sill
s, 
etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention deals with a spatial structural 
prefabricated element made by means of folding and/or 
molding,
 
conceived to make a rigid body, like a sandwich, with a high 
resistance to compression, bending and sagging in such a way 
that, having an internal structure such as spatial 
structures, nevertheless, it has the peculiarity that the 
inner polygons delimited by the bars of the spatial 
structures themselves are
 
embodied, and are flat polygonal surfaces. This determines a 
prefabricated material that can be used in any industrial 
field, in engineering, building and agriculture to obtain 
forging, partition walls, enclosures, panels of any kind to 
build walls, insulation, floating bodies and in general 
terms,
 
any kind of application field for many different uses. The prefabricated element can be obtained easily, either 
folding a sheet of the adequate material or by means of 
molding always obtaining a prefabricated material with a 
light weight and a high resistance thus providing more 
advantages
 
and better mechanical and economic performance than the 
elements and/or products known up to now. For the architecture and industrial techinque a spatial 
structure is a setting of resistant elements whose behavior 
analysis can be determined by the traditional system of 
independent planes such as in the case of frameworks, roof 
trusses, tiles, arches, lattices, etc... The calculation complexity of a spatial structure 
resides in the determination of the axial stresses of each of 
the elements (bars) of which the set, taken as a whole 
consists. Generally, these sets are composed by a studding or a 
triangle shaped mesh of equal bars joined at common corners 
called spatial knots.  The above joints, which are articulated, behave in real 
life as a hyper static structure, that is, any stress applied 
on any of its elements is transmitted axially to the other 
elements and therefore the sizing and the use of the 
materials
 
is much more profitable than in traditional structures. As it is also known the practical application of this 
building system allows an incomparable gauziness when roofing 
vast surfaces reducing the abutment points practically to 
perimetric areas. At the same time it allows to build great 
projectures which would be impossible (in economic terms) 
with any other building system. Nevertheless, the use of the spatial technique is 
subject to three serious imponderables.

<CLAIMS>
Spatial structural element prefabricated by means of 
folding and/or molding which, based on the concept of spatial 

structure, is generally composed by a network or polygonal 
mesh of identical bars joined in common vertexes called 

spatial knots. Its main feature is that it is composed by a 
hollow and open body obtained by means of folding and/or 

molding which embodies the polygonal surfaces delimited by 
the edges which coincide with the assumed linear bars of a 

spatial structure, determining an inner texture composed by 
inclined 

flat surfaces and an external finishing either flat or 
spherical. 
Spatial structural element prefabricated by means of 
folding and/or molding, according to claim 1, whose main 

feature is that the hollow body which constitutes the 
prefabricated element is obtained by means of sheets or 

plates of a material either natural or artificial that can be 
folded and/or molded. 
Spatial structural element prefabricated by means of 
folding and/or molding, according to claims 1 and 2 whose 

main 
feature is that the polygonal surfaces which embody it are 

constituted by pyramids whose inner edges are joined together 
by adherence, fusion or welding, if they are composed of two 

or more folded elements. 
Spatial structural element prefabricated by means of 
folding and/or molding according to the above claim, whose 

main feature is that the inclined edges of the pyramids and 
of the basis are complemented by stress bars thus 

constituting a supplementary mesh or net also spatial. 
Spatial structural element prefabricated by means of 
folding and/or molding according to the above claims whose 

main feature is that it can be superimposed or fitted on 
similar ones to determine a final geometric configuration of 

flat and parallel external faces or with a general spherical 
 

shape. 
Spatial structural element prefabricated by means of 
folding and/or molding according to the above claims, whose 

main feature is that the basis of the pyramids can be closed 
both on the top and bottom side by means of horizontal sheets 

or meshes, parallel to each other. The edges can have any 
lateral finishing to determine edges with the following 

shapes cornice, French roof, vertical or grooved and tongued 
combinations.
