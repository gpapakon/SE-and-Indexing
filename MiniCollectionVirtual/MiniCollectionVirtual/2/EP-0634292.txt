<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plate for stencil 
printing, that is, forming an image on a paper or other 
surface by forcing ink through perforations of a stencil 
image that is formed in a stencil paper, and further 
relates to the structure of the plate for stencil printing. A stamp-producing device is described in Japanese 
Patent application Kokai No. HEI-5-93846 which was not 
published until after the priority date of this 
application. The stamp-producing device is for forming 
images on a stencil plate fed into the device and by which 
the image can be reproduced. The stencil plate includes a 
frame, an ink-permeated body, heat-sensitive stencil paper, 
and a film. An opening of substantially the same shape as 
the ink-permeated body is formed in the frame. For 
example, when the ink-permeated body has a planar 
rectangular shape, the opening also has a planar 
rectangular shape. The ink-permeated body is fitted to the 
interior of the opening and sandwiched between the film and 
the heat-sensitive stencil paper. The film, a base 
material that is impermeable to the ink, is adhered by 
adhesive to one side of the frame so as to cover the 
opening and the ink-permeated body on one side. The heat-sensitive 
stencil paper is adhered by adhesive to the other 
side of the frame so as  
 
to cover the opening and the ink-permeated body on the other 
side. The stencil plate is inserted into the stamp-producing 
device where a stencil image is formed in the stencil 
paper by a perforation means, such as a thermal head provided 
in the stencil producing device, based on image data of 
desired character strings, symbols, figures, and the like. 
The stencil plate formed with the stencil image is attached 
to the lower surface of a portable stamp block. Images of 
the desired character strings, symbols, figures, and the like 
are stamped on the surface of papers or products using the 
portable stamp block and the stencil plate. However, a stencil producing device of the above 
configuration has the following problems. When stamping using 
the stamp block, ink from the ink-permeated body can contact the 
adhesive layers that adheres the ink-permeable film and the 
stencil paper to the frame. The ink permeates the adhesive to an 
extent that varies with the type of solvent in the ink. The 
adhesion of the adhesive drops as a result so that the film and 
the heat-sensitive stencil paper peel away from the frame. A 
great deal of ink can leak from gaps that open between the film 
and the frame, and the

A stencil plate (8) for stencil printing, the stencil 
plate comprising: 


an ink-permeated body (13) permeated with ink; 
a heat-sensitive wrapping (15a) perforatable by heat 
to form the stencil, the heat-sensitive wrapping (15a) 

being wrapped around and completely enveloping the ink-permeated 
body; and 
an ink-impermeable base material (14) adhered to the 
outside of the heat-sensitive wrapping on one side of the 

ink-permeated body. 
A stencil plate according to claim 1, wherein the 
heat sensitive wrapping (15a) is made from a thermoplastic 

film and a porous support attached to each other, the 
thermo-plastic film forming one side of the heat-sensitive 

wrapping and the porous support forming another side of the 
heat-sensitive wrapping, the porous support being in 

contact with the ink-permeated body. 
A stencil plate according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the 
closure of the wrapping is in an area between the body (13) 

and the base material (14). 
A stencil plate according to any of the preceding 
claims, wherein the heat-sensitive wrapping is a 

substantially rectangular sheet (15) with two widthwise 
edges and two lengthwise edges, the widthwise edges being 

folded around the ink-permeated body into widthwise flaps 
and the lengthwise edges being folded around the ink-permeated 

body into lengthwise flaps so that the widthwise 
flaps and the lengthwise flaps are sandwiched between the 

ink-permeated body and the ink-impermeable base material 
(14).  

 
A stencil plate according to claim 4, wherein a surface 
of at least one of the lengthwise flaps is adhered to the ink-impermeable 

base material. 
A stencil plate according to claim 4 or 5, wherein the 
lengthwise flaps are folded around the ink-permeated body so as 

to at least partially overlap the widthwise flaps and at least 
partially overlap each other. 
A stencil plate according to any one of claims 4,5 and 
6, wherein the widthwise flaps are folded around the ink-permeated 

body so as to at least partially overlap each other. 
A stencil plate according to claims 1,2 or 3, wherein 
the heat-sensitive wrapping (51c) is of substantially tubular 

shape with openings defined at each end (51a, 51b), the openings 
being sealed by adhesive (52) on the interior surfaces thereof, 

one end being folded to form a flap, the thermoplastic film of 
the flap being adhered (53) to another part of the thermoplastic 

film of the wrapping at an area between the ends with the flap 
sandwiched between the ink-impermeable base material and the ink-permeated 

body. 
A stencil plate as claimed in claim 8 wherein the 
second end is folded into another flap and wherein the 

thermoplastic film of the other flap is adhered to another part 
of the thermoplastic film and sandwiched between the ink-impermeable 

base material and the ink-permeated body.  
 
A stencil plate according to any one of the preceding 
claims further comprising a frame (12) formed with an opening 

(11), the opening being formed to a shape that substantially 
corresponds to a shape of the ink-permeated body (13) surrounded 

by the heat-sensitive wrapping (15a), the ink-permeated body 
surrounded by the heat-sensitive wrapping being fitted in the 

opening, the ink-impermeable base material being adhered to a 
surface of the frame.
