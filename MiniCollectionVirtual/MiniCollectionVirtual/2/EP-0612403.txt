<ABSTRACT>
A connection type fluid transfer and treatment system apparatus (100) and method for efficiently and continuously executing transfer and treatment of small amounts of sample solutions without substantial transfer loss, which includes a first tube (110a) having one open end (112a) and a second closed end, a second tube (110b) having substantially the same shape as the first tube also having one open end (112b) and one closed end, and a connector assembly (126) for connecting together the open end (112a) of the first tube (110a) to the open end (112b) of the second tube (110b). The connector assembly (126) includes a foramenous membrane support (134), which removably receives chemically or biologically treated membranes (156) for applying a predetermined treatment to a solution while passing the sample solution from the first tube (110a) to the second tube (110b). The sample is typically filtered through the membrane (156) by centrifugation. A special adaptor (170) is provided for receivingly engaging the transfer system (100) during centrifugation. The system (100) permits handling microliter quantities of reactive solutions in biochemical analyses, treatments and assays without use of micropipets, without the usual loss of solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dual invertible microtube and connector assembly for micro
solutions capable of performing efficient and continuous
transfer and/or treatment of a small amount of sample
solution.Conventionally, studies in the fields of analytical
biochemistry and clinical chemistry have been generally
made on the basis of working with sample treatment
solutions of milliliter amounts. With recent development
of biotechnology and immunochemistry, however, the studies
in these fields are made on the basis of results of
treatment of sample solutions of size on the order of
microliters. As the treatment unit of the sample solution
becomes smaller, the following are becoming problems.In the analysis of biological samples by high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), high performance
capillary zone electrophoresis or many other techniques,
pretreatment of a samples prior to analysis is often
required. In other cases, two or more enzymatic
digestions must be conducted in succession to obtain the
desired products. In such instances, it is necessary for
the sample solution, obtained by an enzyme reaction in a
reaction tube, to be filtered through an ultrafiltration
membrane to remove molecules having larger molecular
weights or insoluble fine particles in order to prevent
clogging of the high performance liquid chromatography
columns.Typically, an instrument, such as for example a
micropipet, is used to transfer the sample solution from
the reaction tube into another device for ultrafiltration. 
In this method, however, a certain amount of loss of the
sample is inevitable in the process of transferring the
sample solution. The loss is greater when the sample
quantities are smaller.In another example, a protein may be labeled using
radioisotopes, and then the labeled protein constituent
and the isotopes should be separated. In such cases, it
is conventional that, after labeling with the isotope in
a reaction tube, part or all of the sample solution is
transferred, by micropipet or the like, into a device for
radiation measurement. Accordingly, the above-described
problem of loss of the sample also arises in the process
of transferring the sample solution. Also, the risk of
radiation contamination of instruments used in liquid
transfer cannot be avoided.Furthermore, when carrying out sample handling
procedures which by their nature require a plurality of
steps, such as the enzyme reaction and the sample radioisotope
labeling procedures described above, the problems
associated with the amount
