<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein is a wire for an Nb₃X superconducting 
wire, which is improved in workability and soundness of a 

diffusion barrier layer without increasing the diffusion 
barrier layer in thickness. This wire for an Nb₃X 

superconducting wire comprises a wire (14) which is 
prepared by superposing and winding up a first sheet (107) 

consisting of pure Nb or an Nb alloy and a second sheet 
(108) consisting of metal atoms X, reacting with Nb for 

forming a compound exhibiting superconductivity, or an X 
alloy, a stabilizing material layer (111) which is 

provided to enclose the wire (14), and a diffusion barrier 
layer (110) which is provided between an outer surface of 

the wire (14) and an inner surface of the stabilizing 
material layer (111) for preventing the metal atoms X from 

being diffused in the stabilizing material layer (111), 
and the diffusion barrier layer (110) is made of a metal 

material having larger tensile strength than that of the 
first sheet (107). It is possible to obtain a high-performance 

Nb₃X superconducting wire having a high 
critical current density and a large residual resistance 

ratio of the stabilizing material, by heat treating this 
wire.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wire body for an Nb3X 
superconducting wire, and more particularly, it relates to 
a wire body for an Nb3X superconducting wire which is employed 
as a high magnetic field superconducting material such as 
a superconducting magnet for a nuclear fusion reactor or 
the like. In general, an Nb3X superconducting material such as 
Nb3Al, Nb3Sn or Nb3Ge is expected as a superconducting 
material since the same is applicable to a high magnetic 
field use, which cannot be satisfied by an alloy 
superconducting material such as NbTi. In particular, an 
Nb3Al superconducting material is expected as a useful 
superconducting material for a nuclear fusion reactor 
which receives high magnetic force in a high magnetic 
field, or a superconducting material for power storage, 
due to a high critical current and excellent stress-strain 
effect in a high magnetic field. In general, it is difficult to plastically work such 
an Nb3X superconducting material, which is extremely hard 
and brittle as compared with an alloy superconducting  
 
material such as NbTi. Thus, various studies have 
generally been made on a method of preparing such an Nb3X 
superconducting material. Fig. 10 is an Nb-Al binary alloy phase diagram. Referring to Fig. 10, Nb3Al stably exists under a high 
temperature of at least 1600°C with a stoichiometric 
composition ratio of Nb to Al of 3:1. Under a low 
temperature of less than 1600°C, however, the Nb3Al is 
formed with mixture of Nb2Al, which is a non-superconducting 
material. Therefore, an Nb3Al compound 
superconducting material which is prepared at a low 
temperature of less than 1600°C has a low critical 
temperature, a low critical magnetic field (Hc) and a low 
critical current density (Jc) in general. Thus, no method 
of preparing an Nb3Al superconducting material has been put 
into practice although there has been studied a quenching 
method of cooling the material from a high temperature of 
at least 1600°C in a short time or the like. However, it has recently been recognized that 
excellent Nb3Al is formed in a portion having a short 
diffusion length of Al atoms in an Nb layer and/or a 
portion having a short diffusion length of Nb atoms in an 
Al layer, even if the temperature is not more than 1000°C. 
To this end, there have been developed production methods 
such as powder metallurgy (PM), composite working such as  
 
a tube method and clad chip extrusion, and a jelly roll 
method. Every one of these methods is adapted to mix pure 
Nb or an Nb
