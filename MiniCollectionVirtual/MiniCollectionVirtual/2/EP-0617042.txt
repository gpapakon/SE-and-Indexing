<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel organic phosphorus
compounds of non-halogen type and flame-retarded resin
compositions containing the same which are excellent in
flame-retardant properties and heat resistance.Organic polymers such as thermoplastic resins (e.g.,
polypropylene, polystyrene and acrylonitrile-butadienestyrene
(ABS) resins) and thermosetting resins (e.g., polyurethane
and phenol resins) are available at relatively low
cost and have excellent properties such as easy molding.
Such organic polymers are widely used in all kinds of commodities
including electronic components and automobile
components. However, these organic polymers are flammable.
Once they are involved in fire, they are readily burned and
lost. A fire of cable causes a great damage to our society.
A law has recently been enacted which provides that these
organic polymers shall be flame-retardant when used in 
products for daily use such as electric products, automobile
interior decoration components and fiber products. For
example, in the United States, there are the UL standard for
electric apparatus and MVSS-302 Flame-Retardant Rule for
automobiles.As a known method for giving flame-retardant properties
to organic polymers, a flame-retardant is added to organic
polymers when preparing a molded product. As the flame-retardants,
there are inorganic compounds, organic phosphorus
compounds, organic halogen compounds and organic phosphorus
compounds containing halogen. Out of the above compounds,
organic halogen compounds and organic phosphorus
compounds containing halogen exhibit an excellent flame-retardant
effect. However, these compounds containing halogen
are pyrolyzed in the process of molding resins to produce
hydrogen halide, which corrodes molds and cause resins
to be deteriorated and colored. Furthermore, such compounds
adversely affect our working environment. Still furthermore,
the compounds generate toxic gas such as hydrogen halide
toxic to human bodies.Typical flame-retardants which do not contain halogens
are inorganic compounds such as magnesium hydroxide. However,
since these inorganic compounds are inferior in
flame-retardant effect, it is necessary to add a large
amount to achieve a sufficient flame-retardant effect. Thus
such flame-retardants have a drawback of allowing resins to
be deprived of their inherent properties. Halogen-free organic phosphorus compounds are generally
used as a flame-retardant having a relatively favorable
flame-retardant effect. Aromatic phosphorus compounds such
as triphenyl
