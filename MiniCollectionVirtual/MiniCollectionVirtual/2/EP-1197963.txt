<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical recording
medium and method, which record information by irradiating a
laser beam to a recording layer so as to form a recording mark,
and in particular, to a technology of forming a plurality of
recording marks having different state so as to record a data
at a multi-level.In a conventional optical recording medium, a method has
been employed such that a data is recorded by changing a length
of read signal (i.e., a length of reflection signal modulation
section). On the contrary, the following method has been
frequently studied, more specifically, a plurality of data is
recorded to each signal having the same length by changing a
depth of the read signal (i.e., a modulation degree of reflection
signal) at multiple stages.According to the above optical recording method, as
compared with the case where a binary data is merely recorded
by the presence of pit, a plurality of data is recorded in a
depth direction, so that a signal quantity allocated to a constant
length can be increased; therefore, it is possible to improve
a track recording density. In general, it is well known to change
a power of laser beam at multiple stages, as the method of a
depth of read signal at multiple stages. Recently, a recording 
medium having a multiple recording layer has been proposed as
the recording medium.In this case, it is called as multi-level recording to
record each data so that a modulation degree of reflection signal
is variable at multiple stages.In the above multi-level recording, a laser beam is
irradiatedatmultiple-stage power inrecording; for this reason,
in particular, when the power of laser beam gradually becomes
large, a problemhas arisen such that a signal quality is worsened
in reading.In particular, in order to achieve a high density of the
recording information of recording medium, in the case where
multi-level recording is carried out in a manner of making small
a recording mark, and changing a laser power at multiple stages,
a signal quality has remarkably worsened in the recording mark
recorded by large laser power.In general, a diameter of the collected beam is expressed
as Kλ/NA (K: constant, λ: laser wavelength, NA: numerical
aperture of lens. For example, in a pickup used for a CD, the
laser wavelength λ is 780 nm, the numerical aperture NA is 0.50,
and the diameter of collected beam is about 0.8 µm. Thus, when
the recording mark length is made small up to the vicinity of
about 0.8 µm, the above problem of signal deterioration has
remarkably arisen.
