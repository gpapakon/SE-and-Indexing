<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an elongate body (23), especially a section, including an improved fastening lip, especially for fastening onto the edge of a metal sheet or an assembly of metal sheets. According to the invention, an elongate body (23), especially a section, includes a fastening lip (9'), this lip being itself equipped with a lip (25) increasing the bearing force of the fastening lip (9') when a tensile unclipping force is exerted. The present invention is mainly applicable to sealing strips for the motor trade.

<CLAIMS>
A profile member comprising a fixing lip adapted to bear
on amounting surface, characterised in that the fixing

lip (9') comprises at least one auxiliary lip (25, 25.1,
25.2) bearing on the mounting surface and applying the

fixing lip (9') against the mounting surface when a
demounting effort is applied to the profile, in order to

increase the intensity of the forces needed to remove the
profile from the mounting surface.
A profile according to claim 1, characterised in that the
auxiliary lip (25, 25.1, 25.2) is constructed at the base

of the fixing lip (9').
A profile according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the fixing lip (9') is disposed on a first wall of a

mounting groove (5).
A profile according to claim 3, characterised in that the
second wall of the mounting groove (5) is provided with a

bearing element (11) disposed substantially opposite the
mounting lip (9').
A profile according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in
that the fixing lip (9') is provided with a plurality of

auxiliary lips (25.1, 25.2), each auxiliary lip being
capable of bearing on a surface of a mounting profile,

particularly a returned edge of a metal sheet or an
assembly of metal sheets (13) of different thicknesses,

penetrating the mounting groove (5). 
A profile according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the said profile is a profiled

seal, particularly for the automobile industry and
particularly of the clinging type, door seal, zeal for a

boot or slot.
A profile according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that it comprises elements produced

from an elastomer.
A profile according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that it comprises elements produced

from a plastomer.
A method of clamping a profile according to any one of
claims 3 to 8, characterised in that it comprises a

stage consisting of causing a returned edge (13) of a
metal sheet (15) or of an assembly of sheets (15, 17) to

penetrate a mounting groove (5) until bearing of the
mounting lip (9') and of the auxiliary lip (25) on a

surface of the said returned edge (13) is achieved.
A method according to claim 9, characterised in that the
said method is a method of fitting a sealing-tight

gasket for the automobile industry.
