<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process and an apparatus for 
introducing a solid into a reactor (14) with the help of a feed enclosure 

(7) connected to the reactor through an injection pipe (10). The process 
comprises (a) introducing the solid into the feed enclosure wherein 

most of the solid settles at rest and then (b) introducing a gas (8) 
into the feed enclosure so that the solid is suspended by the gas to 

form a solid suspension entrained in a dilute-phase conveying system 
by the gas into the reactor through the injection pipe. The 

invention is particularly useful for introducing a solid catalyst 
into a gas-phase polymerisation reactor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for introducing a
solid into a reactor and to an apparatus allowing the process to be
carried out.From US Patent 4,082,513 it is known to introduce a solid
catalyst into a reactor with the aid of an apparatus consisting
essentially of an introduction enclosure connected to the reactor
through the intermediacy of an injection conduit. The catalyst is
first of all introduced into the introduction enclosure which is
then pressurized by an introduction of gas. The catalyst is next
introduced into the injection conduit, in which it is fluidized as
far as the reactor entry by means of another introduction of gas.
The latter is performed by a pipe which emerges directly into the
injection conduit. During the introduction of gas into the
introduction enclosure, the catalyst may be compacted and this can
make its introduction into the injection conduit difficult.
Furthermore, this process has the disadvantage of requiring two
different introductions of gas, thereby causing a considerable
introduction of gas into the reactor.European Patent Application No. 0 101 098 discloses a process
for conveying a particulate solid fuel from a container successively
into a hopper and a vessel, and then into a reactor with the help of
a pneumatic transport. However, a fluidisation gas is used for
maintaining the solid fuel in a fluidised state in the container,
the hopper and the vessel, and a carrier gas is used for conveying
the solid fuel from the vessel into the reactor through the 
pneumatic transport.French Patent Application No. 2 562 077 discloses a process
and an apparatus for introducing a powdery catalyst into a fluidised
bed reactor for a gas phase polymerisation of olefins. However, the
powdery catalyst is conveyed into the reactor in a "plug flow" or
packed bed" mode, i.e. in a dense-phase conveying system
particularly in horizontal line orientations.A process for introducing solid into a reactor, which
preferably may be under a relatively high pressure, has now been
found, in the course of which the solid is not compacted as in known
processes using a dense-phase conveying system. Furthermore, it
requires only a single introduction of gas. The process permits a
good entry of the solid into the reactor as well as very good
dispersion of the solid in the reactor, particularly when a gas
phase reactor such as a fluidised bed reactor is used. In that case,
if the reaction occuring in the reactor is exothermic, the use of
the process of the present invention makes it

<CLAIMS>
Process for introducing a solid into a reactor with the help
of a feed enclosure connected to the reactor through an injection

pipe, characterised in that the process comprises:

(a) introducing the solid into the feed enclosure wherein most of
the solid settles at rest, then (b) introducing a gas tangentically to a wall of the feed

enclosure so that the solid initially at rest is suspended by the
gas in the feed enclosure to form a suspension of the solid

entrained in a dilute-phase conveying system by the gas from the
feed enclosure into the reactor through the injection pipe.
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that more
than 50 % by weight of the solid introduced settles at rest in the

feed enclosure.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 2, characterised
in that the introduction of the gas is performed above the upper

level of the solid settled at rest in the feed enclosure.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that the injection pipe is provided with an entry means, and the

opening of the said entry means bringing the feed enclosure into
communication with the reactor via the injection pipe is performed

simultaneously with or immediately after the beginning of the
introduction of the gas into the feed enclosure. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that the injection pipe is provided with an entry means, and the

closure of the said entry means isolating the feed enclosure from
the reactor is performed immediately after the end of the

introduction of the solid into the reactor and simultaneously with
or immediately before the stopping of the introduction of gas into

the feed enclosure.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised
in that the solid is a catalyst for olefin polymerisation and the

reactor is a gas phase polymerisation reactor containing a
fluidized-bed and/or a mechanically stirred-bed under a pressure

from 0.1 to 5 MPa.
Apparatus for introducing a solid into a reactor (14), the
apparatus essentially consisting of a feed enclosure (7) comprising:


a means (4) for introducing the solid into the feed enclosure,
an outlet (9) connected to the reactor (14) through an
injection pipe (10),
a means (11) making it possible to avoid a gravity flow of
most of the solid present in the feed enclosure into the

injection pipe (10), and
an inlet of a gas introduction conduit (8) which emerges tangentially to a wall
of the feed enclosure (7) making it possible

to suspend in the gas introduced the solid settled at rest in
the feed enclosure (7) to form a solid suspension entrained by

the gas through the injection pipe (10) into the reactor (14).
