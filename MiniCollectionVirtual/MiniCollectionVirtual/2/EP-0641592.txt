<ABSTRACT>
The removal of moisture from gases is carried out by adsorption to a composition which comprises an active metallic component, preferably chromium, on a heat-resistant oxidic support. The absorption of moisture is connected with a colour change of the composition which can be used as an indicator when a transparent adsorption cartridge is employed.

<CLAIMS>
Use of a mass, iron-, nickel-, rhenium-, preferably titanium-, manganese-,
vonadium-, molybdenum- and/or chromium -containing component on a heat-resistant

oxidic support having a large surface area and which has been
activated at 300 to 600 °C with molecular oxygen and then treated with a

reducing gas at a temperature from 200 °C to below the particular activation
temperature, as a color indicator for showing the loading of the mass with water

vapour when water vapour is removed from inert gases.
Use as claimed in claim 1, wherein the mass is mixed with other moisture
adsorbents.
Use as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the mass is used for inert gases, which
contain water vapour in the ppm-range.
Use as claimed in claims 1 to 3, wherein the mass contains silica gel as an
oxidic support.
Use as claimed in claims 1 to 4, wherein the inert gases are passed through a
cartridge hering a transparent wall and which is filled with the mass.
