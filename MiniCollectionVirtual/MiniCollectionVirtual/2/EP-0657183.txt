<ABSTRACT>
An anaesthetic vaporiser 1 includes an inlet 2 for carrier gas, an outlet 4 for 
carrier gas and anaesthetic agent, a first passage 6 interconnecting the inlet 

to the outlet and a first fixed flow restrictor 8 located in the passage 6. A 
second passage 56 extends between a vaporising chamber and the outlet 4 

and located therein is a second fixed flow restrictor 54 and also a solenoid 
valve 58. 
A first pressure transducer 50 generates an electrical signal corresponding to 
the pressure differential P1 across the restrictor 8; and a second pressure 

transducer 52 generates an electrical signal corresponding to the pressure 
differential P2 between the passages 6, 56. A controller responsive to said 

electrical signals from the pressure transducers 50, 52 transmits an electrical 
signal to the valve 58 for controlling the flow of gaseous anaesthetic agent 

through the passage 56 such that 

P2 = P1 x constant 
 
.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to anaesthetic vaporisers.There is described in UK Patent Publication No. 2239807 an anaesthetic
vaporiser for use in administering an anaesthetic agent having a low boiling point
at atmospheric pressure in the order of 20°C to 25°C. The vaporiser disclosed
in this document includes a first passage which extends between an inlet for a
carrier gas and an outlet for carrier gas and a preselected concentration of
gaseous anaesthetic agent. Located in the first passage between the inlet and
the outlet is a laminar flow fixed restrictor. A second passage extends between
the first passage at a location upstream of the fixed restrictor and one chamber
of balance regulator. The balance regulator includes a second chamber
separated from the first chamber by a diaphragm to which is connected for
movement therewith a valve head. The valve head cooperates with a valve
seat to control the flow of gaseous anaesthetic agent contained in a vaporising
chamber. From the second chamber there extends a third passage which
communicates with the first passage downstream of the fixed restrictor. A
laminar flow variable restrictor (rotary valve) is located in the third passage.In use, energy is supplied to the vaporiser which converts the anaesthetic agent
from a liquid to a gaseous state within the vaporising chamber. Carrier gas then
enters the inlet and continues along the first passage through the fixed restrictor
towards the outlet. The pressure upstream of the fixed restrictor is dependent
upon the flow rate of carrier gas entering the inlet. The pressure in the first
chamber of the regulator is the same as that upstream of the fixed restrictor
because of the second passage. This causes the diaphragm to move taking with
it the valve head. The valve head will thus separate from its cooperating valve
seat thereby enabling gaseous anaesthetic agent to leave the vaporising chamber
and pass through the second chamber of the regulator into the third passage
until the pressure in the third passage is the same as that in the first chamber.
The pressure in the first passage upstream of the fixed restrictor and the
pressure in the third passage upstream of the variable restrictor are the same. For any position of the variable restrictor the flow rate of gaseous anaesthetic
agent will depend on that pressure and hence the carrier gas flow rate at the
inlet. This ensures that the flow of an anaesthetic agent rises when the carrier
gas flow rate rises and vice versa and hence the percentage concentration
