<ABSTRACT>
The railway vehicle has at least one bogie (1) with two wheel set units (12, 12') which are connected to one another in an articulated fashion via a coupling arrangement. This bogie 1 is constructed as a frameless bearing arrangement and the vehicle body (17) is mounted on spring elements (10) and has at leats one guide device or at least one pendulum (11) between the bogie (1) and the vehicle body (17). By omitting the complex rotary bogie frame, the structure is greatly simplified and thus lightweight and compact. The radially adjustable wheel set units (12, 12') can be additionally arranged at a small distance from one another. The frameless bogie (1) is therefore in particular highly suitable for railway vehicles on rail networks which have tight bends.

<CLAIMS>
Rail vehicle having a vehicle body (17, 40) and at
least one running gear (1) with two wheel-set

units (2, 3; 12, 12'), which are connected to each
other in articulated manner via a coupling

arrangement (14, 23, 83), characterized in that at
least one running gear (1) is designed as a

frameless support arrangement for the vehicle body
(17, 40) and in that spring members (4, 10) and at

least one guide device (5, 70, 80, 90) are
arranged between the vehicle body (17, 40) and

running gear (1).
Rail vehicle according to Claim 1, wherein the
guide device (5) contains at least one pendulum

(11; 472; 473, 473').
Rail device according to Claim 1 or 2, having two
pendulums (473, 473') which are arranged between

the running gear (1) and the vehicle body (40).
Rail vehicle according to Claim 3, wherein, in
each case, one of the pendulums (473 and 473') is

arranged between one of the wheel-set units (2 and
3 respectively) of the running gear (1) and the

vehicle body (40).
Rail vehicle according to one of Claims 1 to 4, in
which at least two pendulums (473, 473') are

arranged inclined relative to one another and
their extensions - or their projections onto a

plane transverse to the straight direction of
travel - intersect in the vehicle body space,

preferably at passenger height.
Rail vehicle according to Claim 1 or 2, in which
the guide device (70) contains a guide part in the

form of a bracket (71) projecting from the vehicle 
body (17) and coupled to the running gear (1) to

be movable in three dimensions.
Rail vehicle according to Claim 6, wherein the
bracket (71) is articulated on the body (17) in a

hinged manner to be pivotable about an axis (72)
extending substantially in the longitudinal

direction of the vehicle.
Rail vehicle according to Claim 1, wherein the
guide device (80) possesses a guide part (81, 82),

attached to the vehicle body (17), for a support

part (draw-bar 13) of the running gear (1) which
can be movably brought together with the guide

part transversely to the longitudinal direction of
the vehicle.
Rail vehicle according to Claim 1, in which the
guide device (90) contains a support arrangement

which is vertically displaced relative to the
coupling arrangement (14) and movable in the

transverse direction of the vehicle, and possesses
two support parts (91, 91') which can each be

supported relative to one another by one of the
wheel-set units (12, 12') in the longitudinal

direction of the vehicle.
Rail vehicle according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
wherein at least one passive or active adjusting

and/or restoring member (15, 15'; 45; 85) is
arranged between the wheel-set units (2, 3; 12,

12').
Rail vehicle according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
wherein at least one of the wheel-set units (2, 3;

12, 12') is formed in the running gear (1) as a
drive unit. 
Rail vehicle according to one of Claims 1 to 11,
wherein a push-pull device (push-pull rod 16, 46;

bracket 71) for the transmission of tractive
forces is arranged between at least one running

gear (1) and the vehicle body (17, 40).
Rail vehicle according to one of Claims 1 to 12,
wherein the spring members (4, 10) are helical or

pneumatic springs.
Rail vehicle, designed as a multi-part articulated
motive power unit (6), in which at least one part

(61) lying between two parts (62, 63) of the
motive power unit 6 is designed according to one

of Claims 1 to 13.
Running gear (1) having two wheel-set units (2, 3;
12, 12') which are connected to each other in an

articulated manner and contain axle bearings (44,
121, 121') on which supporting spring members (4,

10) for supporting the vehicle body (17, 40) are
arranged, and having at least one guide device (5,

70, 80) which is movably coupled to one of the
wheel-set units (2, 3; 12') and is intended to be

fixed on vehicle body (17), and having at least
one adjusting and/or restoring member (15, 15';

45; 85), which is arranged between the two wheel-set
units (2, 3; 12, 12').
