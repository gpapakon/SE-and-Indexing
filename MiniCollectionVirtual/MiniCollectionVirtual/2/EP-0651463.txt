<ABSTRACT>
An electric cable is soldered to an electronic circuit 
board by sticking the heat-resistive adhesive tape on the 

end portion of the insulating ocating and the end portion 
of the core conductor of the cable, and melting solder by 

contacting the heater tip on the heat-resistive adhesive 
tape. Therefore, the coating of the electric cable is 

prevented from being peeled off when heated and the heater 
tip is free from solder dregs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of soldering
an electric cable to an electronic circuit board directly
and, particularly, to a soldering method with using a
heater chip of a heated soldering device.In a case where an electric cable such as flat cable
is soldered to an electronic circuit board, it is usual
to directly solder core conductors of the flat cable to a
wiring pattern on the electronic circuit board. In such
case, however, a portion of a coating of the electric
cable in the vicinity of soldered portions is melted by
soldering heat and the corresponding portion of the core
conductors to the melted coating are exposed. As a reult,
mechanical strength of the core conductors in the vicinity
of the connecting portions is degraded, leading breakage
of the conductors.In order to solve the problem of breakage of the
conductors around the soldered portions, an electric
cable protecting method is disclosed in Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open No. Sho 60-95869 published on May 29, 
1985, in which a hot-melt of a plastic material which
becomes a molten state by heat and then solidified is
fixed on a tip portion of an electric cable. The hot-melt
is melted by heat given to the solder connecting portion
of the electric cable, flows to a peripheral portion of
core conductors of the cable to fill it and, then, is
solidified. With such hot-melt, the core conductors
around the connecting portion is reinforced and the
conductor breakage is prevented.In this method, however, there is a problem that a
molten hot-melt flows onto a surface of the circuit board,
so that the board surface is contaminated. Further, since
it is impossible to control the flowing direction of the
molten hot-melt, there may be another problem that hot-melt
adheres to undesirable portions of the circuit board
which are not to be covered by such hot-melt.On the other hand, when an electric cable is to be
soldered to a circuit board by utilizing a heater tip of
a heated soldering device, there is a problem that solder
dregs remain on the heater tip, leading to defective
soldering. Therefore, the heater tip must be cleaned
frequently.An object of the present invention is to provide
a soldering method for electric cable having insulating 
coating, which can prevent a portion of the insulating
coating of the cable which is in the vicinity of a
soldering portion from being melted by soldering heat
to thereby prevent core conductors of the cable from
being exposed.Another object of the present invention is to provide
a soldering
