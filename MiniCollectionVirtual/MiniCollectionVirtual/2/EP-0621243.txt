<ABSTRACT>
A valve block assembly for supplying air under 
pressure to an air operated mechanism of a glass 

container manufacturing machine comprising a valve 
block body, conduit means defined in the valve block 

body, a valve for controlling the flow of air under 
pressure to the conduit means and means for preventing 

the pressurization of the conduit means including 
a hole in the valve body block communicating with the 

conduit means, a sealing plug located within the 
hole, an axial bore in the sealing plug, an elongated 

pin slidingly received within the axial bore, one end 
of the pin being located within the conduit means and 

the other end of the pin being located outside of the 
block, a cylindrical member coaxially secured to the 

one end of the pin a cylindrical control plug having 
an axial bore through which the pin extends and a 

cylindrical recess for receiving the cylindrical 
member, sealing means for preventing the leakage of 

air between the pin and the control plug, sealing 
means for preventing the leakage of air between the 

control plug and the cylindrical member when the 
cylindrical member is located in the cylindrical 

recess, and an air passage extending from the surface 
of the pin adjacent the cylindrical member through 

the pin to the other end of the pin, so that when the 
cylindrical member is spaced from the control plug 

the conduit means will be in communication with the 
atmosphere outside the valve block body but that when 

the cylindrical member is located within the recess 
the conduit means can be pressurized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to I.S. (individual
section) machines which make glass containers from molten
gobs of glass.Each individual section of an I.S. machine has a blank
side which forms a parison from the gob in a blank side
mould and a blow side which forms the final glass container
from the parison in a blow side mould. A number of movable
mechanisms such as a blank side mould opening and closing
mechanism, a plunger mechanism to be moved into a gob
contained within the blank side mould, an invert mechanism
for taking the formed parison and carrying it to the blow
side, a blow side mould opening and closing mechanism, a
takeout for removing the formed glass container from the
blow side and depositing it on a dead plate and a pusher
which will displace a bottle from the dead plate onto a
conveyor are associated with each section of these
mechanisms require air having a variety of pressures.To control the application of this air, each section
has a valve block which supports a number of on/off valves
which are operated by electronically controlled solenoids.
A prior art valve block is shown in U.S. Patents numbered
3,918,489 and 4,382,451.These valve blocks each comprise a valve block body
supporting an array of pneumatic valves for controlling the
flow of air from a high pressure or a low pressure source to
conduit means leading to a pneumatic mechanism. However it
is from time to time desirable to be able to cut off the
supply of air to a specific mechanism irrespective of the
operation of the pneumatic valve associated with that
mechanism, and these two prior art valve blocks do not
provide this possibility. It is an object of the present invention to provide an
improved valve block for a section of an I.S. machine.The present invention provides a valve block assembly
for supplying air under pressure to an air operated
mechanism of a glass container manufacturing machine
comprising;
a valve block body,a conduit means defined in said valve block body anda valve for controlling the flow of air under pressure
to the conduit means;
   characterised in that the valve block comprises means
for preventing pressurisation of the conduit means
comprising;a hole in the valve block body communicating with the
conduit means,a cylindrical control plug, located within the hole,an axial bore in the control plug,an elongated pin slidingly received in the axial bore,
one end of the pin being located within the hole and the
other end of the pin being located outside the block, a cylindrical member coaxially

A valve block assembly for supplying air under pressure
to an air operated mechanism of a glass container

manufacturing machine comprising;

a valve block body (93),
a conduit means (70) defined in said valve block body
(93) and
a valve for controlling the flow of air under pressure
to the conduit means;

   characterised in that the valve block comprises means
for preventing pressurisation of the conduit means (70)

comprising;
a hole (114) in the valve block body (93) communicating
with the conduit means (70),
a cylindrical control plug (172), located within the
hole (114),
an axial bore (151) in the control plug (172),
an elongated pin (150) slidingly received in the axial
bore (151), one end of the pin (150) being located within

the hole (114) and the other end of the pin (150) being
located outside the block (93),
a cylindrical member (162) coaxially secured to said
one end of the pin (150),
the cylindrical control plug (172) having a cylindrical
recess (177) for receiving the cylindrical member (162)
sealing means (174) for preventing the leakage of air
between the pin (150) and the control plug (172),
sealing means (163) for preventing the leakage of air
between the control plug (172) and the cylindrical member

(162) when the member (162) is located in the cylindrical
recess (177),
and an air passage (164) extending from the surface of
the pin (150) adjacent the cylindrical member (162) through 

the pin (150) to the other end of the pin (150), so that
when the cylindrical member (162) is spaced from the control

plug (172) the conduit means (70) is in communication with
the atmosphere outside the valve block body (93) but that

when the cylindrical member (162) is located in the recess
(177) of the plug (172) the conduit means (70) can be

pressurised.
A valve block assembly according to claim 1, further
comprising means (180, 182) for stopping the forward displacement of

said control plug (172) at a selected location as said pin
(150) is displaced forwardly into said valve block body (93) so

that said cylindrical element (162) can be removed from said
cylindrical recess (177) and displaced to a position spaced

from said control plug (172).
A valve block assembly according to claim 2, further
comprising a knob (154) on said other end of said pin (150)

having an annular coaxial groove (156) therein and a latch
element (194) pivotally mounted for displacement from a

remote position to an advanced position whereat said latch
element will be located within said annular groove when said

pin is located at said position where said cylindrical
member (162) is spaced from said control plug (172).
A valve block assembly according to claim 3, further
