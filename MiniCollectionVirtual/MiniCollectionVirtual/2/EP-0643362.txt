<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for reading information, especially bar codes, having a light source which sends a focused light beam to a deflection apparatus, as a result of which the light beam - lying in a basic plane - moves to and fro within an angular range, reflected light being fed to a photoelectric converter to register the information. Arranged in the region of the basic plane (32) is an angular mirror (29) which has a first mirror plane (33) and a second mirror plane (34), the first mirror plane (33) and the second mirror plane (34) passing through the basic plane (32) in an oblique-angled position for a deflection of the light beam (14) and, furthermore, extend at an angle ( THETA ) to each other in such a way that a scanning beam (2, 2') originating from the first mirror plane (33) and a second scanning beam (2, 2'') originating from the second mirror plane (34) are incident on a reading plane (19) in which the information (20) is located, the line of incidence (10) of the first scanning beam (2, 2') extending transversely to the line of incidence (11) of the second scanning beam (2'') and, preferably, the two lines of incidence (10, 11) crossing each other (20) for omni-directional reading of the information.

Apparatus for reading information, in particular bar codes, comprising a light source (12)
emitting a bundled light beam to a polygonal rotating mirror (17), wherein the light beam

- lying in a primary plane (32) - is moving back and forth within an angle range (α),
wherein reflected light is forwarded to a photoelectric transducer (23) for detecting information,


characterized in that
 in the area of the primary plane (32), in addition to the
rotating mirror, a two-legged angle mirror (29) for omnidirectional reading of information

is positioned detachably at the apparatus, comprising a first mirror plane (33) and a second
mirror plane (34), wherein the first mirror plane (33) and the second mirror plane (34)

are obliquely penetrating the primary plane and define an angle () between each other for
deflecting the light beam such that a first scanning beam (2',2') coming from the first mirror

plane (33) as well as a second scanning beam (2",2") coming the second mirror plane

(34) impinge on a reading plane (19), in which the information (20) is located, wherein
the impinging line (10) of the first scanning beam (2',2') is oblique with respect to the

impinging line (11) of the second scanning beam (2",2") and the two impinging lines
(10, 11) cross each other.
