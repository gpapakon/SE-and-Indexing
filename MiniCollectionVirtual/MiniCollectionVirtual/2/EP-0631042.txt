<ABSTRACT>
A modified exhaust tailpipe especially for use with an aircraft turbofan engine 
utilizing a noise suppressor. The modified tailpipe is connected to the exhaust duct 

of the 
engine. The forward end of the tailpipe is essentially the same diameter as that of the 

exhaust duct of the engine. The contour of the tailpipe is such that it increases in 

diameter to form a bulge (31) to increase the flow area for fan gases 
in the area of a mixer (24) 

which is supported within the forward end of the tailpipe exhaust system. This improves 
the operating efficiency of the jet engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
Noise generated by aircraft jet engines during takeoff and landing is a matter of
serious concern in most metropolitan areas of the world. In the United States alone,
approximately five million people live or work adjacent to airports and are affected
significantly by aircraft noise. Many municipalities have taken action to require reduction
in aircraft noise.Much work has been done on designing turbofan and turbojet aircraft engines to
reduce noise levels. For background information relating to noise reduction systems for
jet engines, reference may be had to the following U.S. Patent Numbers 3,710,890;
4,077,206; 4,117,671; 4,501,393; 4,909,346; 5,060,471 and 5,167,118.It generally can be said that in turbofan jet aircraft engines, the engine airflow is
split into two parts as it passes through the engine, i.e. the primary or core flow and the
fan or bypass flow. The primary or core flow passes through the low pressure and high
pressure compressors and into the combustion chamber where fuel is mixed with the high
pressure air and burned. The core flow then passes through the high and low pressure
turbines and into the exhaust duct. The fan or bypass air flow only passes through the
fan (or low pressure compressor) and is routed around the core engine and into the 
exhaust duct. In low by-pass ratio turbofan engines, the two flows enter the exhaust duct
at approximately equal pressure but at much different temperatures (approximately 110째C (230째
F) for the bypass flow and approximately 593째C (1100째F) for the core flow). Unless mixed, the
two flows remain substantially separate as they exhaust through the tailpipe of the jet
engine. The hot core flow exits the engine at very high velocity which is much greater
than the velocity of the fan gas. This hot core gas generates a large part of the engine
jet noise.One apparatus which has been developed and which has achieved beneficial
results in the noise reduction of turbofan aircraft engines is the flow mixer, the multi-channel
or multi-lobe inverted flow type. Examples of use of such mixers for noise
suppression are found in the previously referenced patent numbers 4,117,671 and
4,077,206. These flow mixers mix the two gas flows to more or less cause all the gas
flowing through the tailpipe to flow at the same velocity. These flow mixers have been
credited with noise reduction In the range of 3.5 to 4.5 decibels (dB) in the Effective
Perceived Noise Level (EPNL), depending upon the engine cycle and bypass ratio. The

<CLAIMS>
A noise suppressed turbofan engine comprising:


an engine exhaust duct through which engine core and fan gases are ejected;
a tailpipe exhaust section (28) having a forward end and an aft end and having a

flow area therethrough, said forward end being connected to said engine exhaust
duct, the tailpipe exhaust section flow area having an internal diameter at the

forward end of d
3
 and expanding to an internal diameter of d
2
;
a mixer (24) for mixing engine core gas and fan gas positioned at least
partially within said tailpipe exhaust section (28) providing a mixed exhaust stream

of engine core gas and fan gas, the mixer (24) being fixed with respect to said
tailpipe exhaust section (28), all substantial portions of the mixer (24) being

forward of a mixing means aft end (33) at which said mixed exhaust stream of
engine core gas and fan gas is provided; and characterised by:
an internally unobstructed tailpipe nozzle section (30) having a forward end
and an exhaust end, the tailpipe nozzle section (30) forming an internal passageway

through which said mixed exhaust stream passes, the tailpipe nozzle section
forward end having an internal diameter of d
2
 and forming a juncture with said
tailpipe exhaust section aft end, the nozzle section (30) converging in diameter

towards said aft end to an internal diameter of d
4
, d
2
 being greater than d
3
 and d

so that thereby a noise reducing internal, increased flow area bulge is formed at
said juncture of said exhaust section (28) and said nozzle section (30), said mixer

aft end being substantially in alignment with the noise reducing bulge at said 
exhaust section and said nozzle section juncture so that thereby no substantial

portion of said mixer (24) extends within the tailpipe nozzle section (30).
A noise suppressed turbofan engine according to claim 1, in which the ratio
of d
2
 to d
3
 is about 1.1.
