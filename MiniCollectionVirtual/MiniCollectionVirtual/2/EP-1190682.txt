<ABSTRACT>
During the preparation of a tooth implant the components have to be repeatedly removed from the artificial jaw, processed and inserted again for checking the progress. The brittle material of the mock jaws can be easily damaged by a screwing-in action, resulting in a loss of precision regarding the finished product. The new design of a temporary tooth implant is provided with a snap-in mechanism. The top part (1) is fitted with a horizontal locking pin (7) and a split tip (8,9,10), which creates an elastic tensioning effect when the lower part (8,9,10) is inserted into the sleeve (12) equipped with spaces (14) for the locking pin (7) and a circular indent (16) for retaining the tip (8,9,10) of the top element (1).

<CLAIMS>
A plug connection for jaw stump models for the releasably securing of tooth crown segments or jaw segments to a model base, with a plug pin (1, 1', 1 ") and a sleeve (12, 12', 12"), whereby the plug pin can be connected in snap-locking fashion with the sleeve and a rotational locking prevents a rotary movement of the plug pin in the sleeve,
characterized in
that
 at its end facing the sleeve (12, 12', 12") the plug pin (1, 1', 1") comprises a spring element (8, 21, 33) with at least one recess for snap-locking connection with the sleeve (12, 12', 12").
A plug connection according to claim 1,
characterized in
that
 the maximum penetration depth of the plug pin (1, 1', 1") in the sleeve (12, 12', 12") is limited by an abutment.
A plug connection according to claim 1,
characterized in
that
 the spring element (8, 21, 33) comprises at least one spring tongue.
A plug connection according to claim 1,
characterized in
that
 the spring element (8, 21, 33) comprises a substantially cylindrical basic element, which is divided into a plurality of spring tongues (10, 22, 34) by at least one longitudinal slot (9, 23, 35) extending as far as the end facing the sleeve (12, 12', 12").
A plug connection according to claim 1,
characterized in
that
 the spring element (8, 33) comprises a circumferential annular groove (11, 36) and can thereby be connected in snap-locking fashion with a matching projection projecting into the inner chamber of the sleeve (12, 12").
A plug connection according to claim 5,
characterized in
that
 the projection projecting into the inner chamber of the sleeve (12) is constructed as an annular circumferential constriction (16).
A plug connection according to claim 5,
characterized in
that
 the projection projecting into the inner chamber of the sleeve (12") is constructed as a laterally offset locking pin (39) partially projecting into the inner chamber of the sleeve (12").
A plug connection according to claim 1,
characterized in
that
 the recess of the spring element (21) is constructed as a continuous cross bore (25), which extends perpendicular through the plug pin axis and engages in snap-locking fashion around a projection constructed as a locking pin (27) projecting into the inner chamber of the sleeve (12').
A plug connection according to claim 2,
characterized in
that
 in the end position of the plug pin (1, 1', 1") in the sleeve (12, 12', 12") defined by the abutment, the recess of the spring element (8, 21, 33) has a defined degree of offset relative to the projection projecting into the inner chamber of the sleeve (12, 12', 12"), so that the plug pin (1, 1', 1") is additionally fixed in the end position with a permanently acting tensile force.
A plug connection according to claim 1,
characterized in
that
 the plug pin (1, 1', 1") comprises a substantially cylindrical basic form (5, 31) with a non-rotationally symmetrical rotational locking section (4, 19, 30), which projects radially at least in part and engages in the region of the sleeve opening with a matching inner chamber of the sleeve (12, 12', 12").
A plug connection according to claim 10,
characterized in
that
 the rotational locking section (4, 30) comprises a radially projecting, substantially cylindrical basic form (5, 31) with at least one flattened section (6, 31) extending parallel to the plug pin axis, and in the region of the sleeve opening the sleeve (12, 12") comprises a matching, inwardly projecting projection (15, 38).
A plug connection according to claim 10,
characterized in
that
 the rotational locking section (19) comprises a polygonal cross sectional surface and the sleeve (12') comprises a matching inner chamber in the region of the sleeve opening.
A plug connection according to claim 10,
characterized in
that
 the rotational locking section (4) comprises at least one radially projecting cross pin (7), which engages with at least one matching recess (14) of the sleeve (12) in the region of the sleeve opening.
A plug connection according to claim 1 and 10,
characterized in
that
 the diameter of the spring element (8, 21, 33) is, at the most, as large as the smallest internal diameter of the sleeve (12, 12', 12") in the region of the sleeve opening.
A plug connection according to claim 1,
characterized in
that
 the plug pin (1, 1', 1") and the sleeve (12, 12', 12") are made of metal, ceramic material or plastics material.
