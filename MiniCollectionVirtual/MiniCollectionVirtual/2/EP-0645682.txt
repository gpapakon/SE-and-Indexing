<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrophotographic
apparatus such as a copying machine, a laser
beam printer or a facsimile machine, a process
cartridge used therein and an image forming method.
More particularly, this invention relates to an
electrophotographic apparatus having a specific
electrophotographic photosensitive member and a
specific cleaning means, a process cartridge having
these, and an image forming method utilizing these.Fig. 2 schematically illustrates the
constitution of a conventional electrophotographic
apparatus. A process of image formation will be
briefly explained with reference to this drawing.In the apparatus, provided therein is an
electrophotographic photosensitive member 21 supported
to be rotatable in the direction of an arrow, on which
an electrostatic latent image is formed to be
developed into visible image with a developer (or a
toner). Around the photosensitive member, image 
forming means such as a primary charging means 22, an
imagewise exposure means 23, a developing means 24, a
transfer means 25, a cleaning means 27 and a pre-exposure
means 28 are provided.First, the electrophotographic photosensitive
member 21 is uniformly charged to a given potential by
the primary charging means 22. Next, a color-separated
optical image or a corresponding optical
image is shed thereon through the imagewise exposure
means 23 such as a laser beam exposure device to form
on the electrophotographic photosensitive member 21 an
electrostatic latent image faithful to the original.
The electrostatic latent image thus formed is
converted into a visible image by the developing means
24, and this visible image, i.e., a toner image, is
transferred to a transfer medium P delivered through
the transfer means 25. The transfer means 25
comprises a transfer corona assembly 25a, a residual
charge eliminator 25b and a transfer belt 25c to
transport the transfer medium P fed from a paper feed
device (not shown). As the transfer belt 25 is
driven, the transfer medium P on the transfer belt 25c
is brought into contact with the toner image formed on
the periphery of the electrophotographic
photosensitive member 21, and the toner image is
transferred onto the transfer medium P by the 
operation of the transfer corona assembly 25a.
Immediately thereafter, the charges accumulating on
the transfer medium P are cancelled by the residual
charge eliminator 25b. After the image transfer has
been completed, the transfer medium P is further
transported by the transfer belt 25c, then separated
from the transfer
