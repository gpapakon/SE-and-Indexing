<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for cancelling interference in a loss in weight feeder in which the output signal from a weighing device is detected at prescribed intervals and the rate of conveying is formed therefrom. In so doing, from the magnitude of the output signal changes from the weighing device, a fuzzy assignment according to type and magnitude of the interference is made according to the fuzzy rules. From the assignment, with the aid of an evaluation unit, a degree of cancellation is generated which cancels the measuring interference component from the output signal.

A method of removing disturbances in a differential
feed weighing machine in which the output signal of a

weighing device is recorded continuously or at preset
intervals and the feed capacity is formed therefrom, wherein

pure measuring disturbances are removed from the output
signal or the feed capacity, characterised in that from the

magnitude of the output signal changes or the changes in the
feed capacity a poorly defined rating is made according to

poorly fuzzy rules, and a degree of extraction is generated
therefrom which extracts the measuring disturbance component

from the output signal or from the feed capacity.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the output signals of the weighing device (1) are fed to an

evaluating device (4) which, from the past output signals,
forms a prognosis value which is compared with the output

signal at the sampling instant, and a difference value is
formed therefrom, the value of which corresponds to the

magnitude of the changes in the output signal of the
weighing device (1) or the changes in the feed capacity.
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the difference value is evaluated in accordance with

fuzzy logic in such manner that a rating as fuzzy
disturbance level in terms of "low", "medium" and "high" is

made, wherefrom a degree of extraction is formed which in
the case of the "high" rating is always high and in the case

of the "low" and "medium" ratings can be either low, medium
or high or a combination thereof, and which corresponds to

the measuring disturbance component and is extracted to this
extent from the output signal or from the feed capacity.
A method according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the time characteristic of the 

changes in the determined degrees of extraction is recorded
and additionally taken into consideration in the evaluation

of following difference values and leads to an increase in
the measuring disturbance certainty.
A method according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the time characteristic of the

changes in the degrees of extraction is taken into
consideration in that the determined changes in the degrees

of extraction during past sampling periods are integrated
and are coupled with the difference value in the respective

evaluation cycle in accordance with fuzzy logic rules.
A method according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the determined delivery rate

(actual value) is compared with a preset value (derived
value) and in the event of a deviation due to a delivery

disturbance a regulation of the feed capacity is performed
whereby, on the basis of the magnitude of the feed capacity

changes, a poorly defined rating of the disturbance in terms
of type and magnitude is made according to fuzzy logic

rules, and a degree of extraction is generated therefrom
which extracts the measuring disturbance component from the

regulation process.
A device for removing disturbances in a differential
feed weighing machine for the implementation of the method

according to one of Claims 1 to 6 having the following
features:


a weighing device is provided which comprises a supply
container, a metering element and a drive means and

which is supported on weighing cells and
an evaluating device is provided comprising a
differentiator for determination of the feed capacity,

a filter for determination of the prognosis and the

estimate value, and a first comparator stage for 
comparing, and forming the difference between, the

prognosis and the delivery rate signal at the sampling
instant,

characterised in that the evaluating device (4) comprises a
fuzzy logic circuit (9) which serves to evaluate the

difference value and which, on the basis of the magnitude of
the difference value, makes a poorly defined rating and from

this determines a degree of extraction which controls the
time constant of the filter (6) and, at the output of the

filter (6), thereby forms an estimate value, which
represents a signal from which the measuring disturbance

component is extracted.
A device according to Claim 7, characterised in that
the evaluating device (4) comprises an integrator (10) which

is connected to the output of the fuzzy logic circuit (9)
and integrates the time characteristic of the change in the

degreeof extraction and which serves for combining with, the
difference value at the following sampling instant and can

be evaluated in accordance with fuzzy logic rules and
thereby increases the measuring disturbance certainty.
A device according to at least one of Claims 7 to 8,
characterised in that the evaluating device (4) comprises a

control circuit which consists of a controller (16), a
second comparator stage (15) and a setting device (14) and

which compares the estimate value at the sampling instant
with a predetermined derived value and from this forms an

adjusting value which controls the drive means (11) of the
weighing device (1) in accordance with the changes in the

feed capacity, whereby the measuring disturbance component
can be extracted from the control circuit by means of the

estimate value.
A device according to Claim 7 or 8, characterised in
that a setting device (14) is provided with which a derived 

value can be preset which, in the evaluating device (4), is
connected via the time function element (17) to the input of

the fuzzy logic circuit (9) and in the event of a derived
value change in the fuzzy logic circuit (9) is coupled to

the difference value signal in such manner that the derived
value change is not evaluated as measuring disturbance.
A device according to one of Claims 7 to 9,
characterised in that the evaluating device (4) is formed as

a programmable calculating circuit wherein the functioning
of the differentiator (5), the filter (6), the first

comparator stage (7), the time function element (17), the
fuzzy logic circuit (9), the integrator (10), the second

comparator stage (15) and the controller (16) is preset by
appropriate software.
