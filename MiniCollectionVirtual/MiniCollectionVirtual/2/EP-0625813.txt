<ABSTRACT>
An annular element (10) constituted by a bimetal 
laminate having a first layer (10a) of a noble material 

and a second layer (10b) of a non-noble metal such as 
nickel or an alloy thereof is disposed, in an 

electrically conductive relationship with the central 
electrode (4), around the portion of the central 

electrode (4) which projects from the insulating 
element (3a, 3) so that, in operation, the spark or 

sparks are struck between the annular element (10) and 
the earth electrode or electrodes (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to spark plugs for 
internal combustion engines with controlled ignition. More specifically, the invention relates to a spark 
plug of the type comprising: 
an outer, tubular metal body, a tubular insulating element disposed in the body, a central electrode which extends through the 
insulating element and projects axially beyond the end 
of the insulating element which faces the combustion 
chamber in use, at least one earth electrode which extends from the 
outer metal body towards the side surface of the 
portion of the central electrode which projects from 
the insulator, and an annular element disposed around the projecting 
portion of the central electrode in an electrically 
conductive relationship with the central electrode so 
that, in operation, the spark or sparks are struck 
between the annular element and the earth electrode. An object of the invention is to provide a spark plug 
of this type which is suitable for very much prolonged 
operation (a "long-life" plug). "Long-life" plugs are known, the earth electrodes of 
which extend from the outer metal body of the plug to 
face the end surface or face of the central electrode  
 
according to a well-known geometrical arrangement. 
Layers of noble metal, typically platinum or an alloy 
thereof, are welded to this end surface of the central 
electrode and to the portion of the earth electrode 
which faces it, and, in use, the spark is struck 
between these layers. However, the use of "long-life" plugs of this type has 
shown some disadvantages; when these plugs are used, 
in particular, in engines having four valves per 
cylinder, the vibrations to which they are subject in 
operation, may cause the plugs to lose their entire 
earth electrodes which, typically, are welded to the 
outer metal bodies of the plugs. In order to eliminate this problem, it was proposed in 
the Applicant's European patent application No. 
EP-A-0 480 886 to dispose an annular element constituted by 
a noble metal or by an alloy thereof around the 
projecting portion of the central electrode in an 
electrically conductive relationship with the central 
electrode so that, in operation, the spark or sparks 
were struck between the annular element and the earth 
electrode. Although a solution such as that just described is 
optimal from a functional point of view, it has the 
disadvantage of a high cost because of the noble 
material used, which is a serious drawback for mass 
production. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
"
