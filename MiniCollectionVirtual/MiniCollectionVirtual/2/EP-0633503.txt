<ABSTRACT>
Novel photopolymerisable compositions as defined in Claim 1 which contain no additional high-molecular-weight binder polymers and can be used as photoresistor compositions which can be applied in aqueous form, in particular for the coating of circuit boards, where the resultant coatings are non-tacky after drying and have good edge coverage.

<CLAIMS>
A photopolymerisable composition comprising, without the addition of 
binder polymers of high molecular weight, 


a) 20 to 80 % by weight of a specific film-forming, acid group-containing 
acrylate of relatively high molecular weight which is 

neutralised with ammonia or an amine or an inorganic base, at least 
10 % by weight of component a) consisting of an acrylate of 

relatively high molecular weight al) which is derived from a 
reaction product of an epoxy resin of relatively high molecular 

weight, which is advanced with a bisphenol, and an ethylenically 
unsaturated monocarboxylic acid and after subsequent reaction with a 

cyclic anhydride of a polycarboxylic acid, 
b) 0.1 to 15 % by weight of a photoinitiator compound, 
c) optionally 1 to 25 % by weight of additives, and 
d) water, or water and up to 15 % by weight of an organic solvent, with 
water forming the balance to 100 % by weight, and also comprises 
e) optionally at least one additional (meth)acrylate monomer or 
(meth)acrylate oligomer or a vinyl compound that can be crosslinked 

by light. 
A photopolymerisable composition according to claim 1, wherein 
component a) is an acrylicized derivative of epoxy resins advanced with 

bisphenols which is reacted with a cyclic anhydride of a polycarboxylic 
acid. 
A photopolymerisable composition according to claim 1, wherein 
component c) is a thermal hardener and/or a pigment or a water-insoluble  

 
dye and/or a filler and/or additives for aqueous coating materials 

(coatings additives). 
A photopolymerisable composition according to claim 1, wherein 
component b) is Irgacure 907® and/or Quantacure ITX®. 
A process for preparing a composition according to claim 1, wherein 
components a), b) and d), and optionally c) and e), are mixed together 

with stirring at room temperature to give a homogeneous emulsion or 
dispersion. 
Use of a photopolymerisable composition according to claim 1 to form 
a photopolymerisable layer on a substrate. 
Use according to claim 6 for coating printed circuit boards. 
Use according to claim 6 as solder resist for printed circuit boards 
or as etch resists or galvanoresist for the fabrication of printed 

circuit boards.
