<ABSTRACT>
Water-immiscible dyes are mixed with citrus solvents and 
non-ionic surfactants to form a water-reducible true dye solution 

containing at least 35 wt% of the water-immiscible dye. The dye 
solution is dispersible in water and infinitely reducible.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to water-reducible dye
compositions which, upon mixing with water, form aqueous
dispersions of the dyes and to the aqueous dispersions formed
therefrom.There are a wide variety of types of dyes which are
water-immiscible. A major advantage of water-immiscible dyes is
that such dyes tend to be permanent, at least with respect to
exposure to water. A disadvantage of such dyes is that they
require organic solvent carriers, such as xylene, which are
problematic from a health and environmental standpoint.The present invention is directed to compositions of water-immiscible
dyes which form stable dispersions in aqueous media
and therefore provide the permanence of water-immiscible dyes
without the accompanying disadvantage of containing harmful
organic solvent carriers.For many industrial applications, such as for forming inks,
high dye loadings are required. Dye solutions typically must be
formulated with a variety of additional ingredients which dilute
the coloring effect of the dye; hence, the need for high dye
loading. Furthermore, the solvent used to dissolve the dye may
not be desirably used at a high level in the formulation.
Accordingly, it is a further object of the invention that the
water-reducible dye solutions have high dye loadings. Water-reducible dye solutions of the present invention
comprise (a) between 35 wt% and 70 wt% of a water-immiscible
dye selected from the dye types consisting of azo type
dyes, phthalocyanine type dyes, and anthraquinones; (b) between
10 and 64 wt% of a solvent system for said water-immiscible
dye in sufficient quantities to dissolve said water-immiscible
dye, said solvent system comprising (b1) between 30
and 100 wt% of a citrus solvent(s) and(b2) between 0
and 70 wt% of a compatible co-solvent(s) which is either
water-miscible or water-immiscible; and (c) between 1 and
55 wt% of a non-ionic surfactant. When mixed into water,
the water-reducible solutions form stable micro dispersions of
the water-immiscible dye solutions in the water, which
dispersions are infinitely reducible. The dyes of such aqueous
dispersions become permanently fixed to the material to which
they are applied.Water-immiscible dyes to which the present invention applies
are:
1. Azo types which includes monoazo, disazo and tetrazo's
of both the metallized and non-metallized varieties.
Metallized dyes are typically described as amine salts of
monatomic metal chelates with one or two molecules of dye,
depending upon the metal used. Non-metallized azo dyes
include
