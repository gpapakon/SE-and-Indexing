<ABSTRACT>
Compounds and pharmaceutical compositions thereof comprise the formula: (R)j - (core moiety), including resolved enantiomers and/or diastereomers, hydrates, salts, solvates and mixtures thereof, wherein j is an integer from one to three, the core moiety is non-cyclic or comprises at least one, five- to seven-membered ring structure, R may be selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, hydroxyl, amino, substituted or unsubstituted benzyl, alkyl (C1-6) or alkenyl (C1-6), and at least one R has formula (I), wherein n is an integer from four to eighteen; each R'1 and R'2 is independently hydrogen, alkyl (C1-4) or alkenyl (C1-4), the alkyl or alkenyl groups being preferably substituted by a halogen, hydroxyl, ketone or dimethylamino group and/or may be interrupted by an oxygen or hydrogen atom or an alkyl (C1-4) group; and each R'3 and R'4 is independently hydrogen or methyl. Preferably, n is an integer from six to ten, R'1 and R'2 are independently hydrogen or methyl and R'3 and R'4 are hydrogen. The compounds are useful in treating or preventing, for example, sepsis syndrome, hematopoietic or organ toxicity, baldness, hair loss or allopecia caused by cytotoxic therapies, and progression of an inflammatory or autoimmune disease.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention provides a class of substituted amino alkyl compounds that are
effective agents to inhibit specific cellular signaling events often induced by noxious or
inflammatory stimuli, or to directly or indirectly (immune stimulation) be anti-microbial to
yeast or fungal infections. More specifically, the inventive compounds have at least one
amine-containing substituent bonded to a core moiety. The inventive compounds are useful
antagonists to control intracellular levels of specific non-arachidonyl sn-2 unsaturated
phosphatidic acids and corresponding phosphatidic acid-derived diacylglycerols which occur
in response to cellular proliferative stimuli.Pentoxifylline (1-(5-oxohexyl)-3,7-dimethylxanthine), abbreviated PTX and
disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,422,307 and 3,737,433, is a xanthine derivative which has seen
widespread medical use for the increase of blood flow. Metabolites of PTX were
summarized in Davis et al., Applied Environment Microbial. 48:327, 1984. One such
metabolite, 1-(5-hydroxyhexyl)-3,7-dimethylxanthine, designated M1 and disclosed in U.S.
Patents 4,515,795 and 4,576,947, increases cerebral blood flow. In addition, U.S. Patents
4,833,146 and 5,039,666 disclose the use of tertiary alcohol analogs of xanthine for enhancing
cerebral blood flow.US 4,558,051 describes pharmaceutical compositions comprising xanthines and one or more
analgesic agents, or xanthines and an anti-inflammatory agent, and methods of using said
compositions to hasten the onset of an analgesic or anti-inflammatory response and to
enhance an analgesic or anti-inflammatory response.U.S. Patent 4,636,507 discloses that PTX and M1 stimulate chemotaxis in
polymorphonuclear leukocytes in response to a chemotaxis stimulator. PTX and related
tertiary alcohol substituted xanthines inhibit activity of certain cytokines to affect chemotaxis
(U.S. Patent 4,965,271 and U.S. Patent 5,096,906). Administration of PTX and GM-CSF
decrease tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow
transplant (Bianco et al., Blood 76: Supplement 1 (522A), 1990). Reduction in bone  
marrow transplant-related complications accompanied reduction in assayable levels of TNF.
However, in normal volunteers, TNF levels were higher among PTX recipients. Therefore,
elevated levels of TNF are not the primary cause of such complications.Therefore, effective therapeutic compounds that are safe and effective for
human or animal administration and that can maintain cellular homeostasis in the face of a
variety of
