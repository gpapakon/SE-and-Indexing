<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a thermoplastic 
resin composition which comprises [A]
 100 weight parts 
of a thermoplastic resin, [B]
 2.0 to 40 weight parts of 
a bromine-containing organic flame retardant, and [C]
 
1.0 to 30 weight parts of a (meth)acrylamide-based 

copolymer and/or a (meth)acrylate ester-based copolymer 
each comprising 65 to 99 mole percent of an olefin-derived 

structural unit (I), 0 to 15 mole percent of a 
(meth)acrylate-derived structural unit (II) and 1 to 35 

mole percent of a (meth)acrylamide-derived or (meth)acrylate 
ester-derived structural unit (III), as 

arranged linearly, with a weight average molecular 
weight of 1,000 to 50,000. 
The thermoplastic resin composition is excellent 
both in flame retardancy and in permanent antistatic 

property. It has been deemed impossible in the art to 
obtain such a resin composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermoplastic
resin composition excellent in antistatic property
inclusive of its aging resistance and in flame
retardant property.In the prior art, thermoplastic resins are provided
with fairly satisfactory lasting and durable
antistatic property by incorporation of, for example, a
polyether diol amide or ester condensate as disclosed
in Japanese Kokai Pat. Pub. Nos. 60-23435, 04-5691
and 03-258850 or a polyether-based copolymer derived
from ethylene oxide, epichlorohydrin, etc. as disclosed
in Japanese Kokai Pat. Pub. No. 63-314261.It is also known that thermoplastic resins can be
made antistatic by addition of surfactants, such as
sodium alkanesulfonates, N,N-diethoxylated laurylamine,
stearic acid monoglyceride, etc.On the other hand, thermoplastic resins can be
rendered flame resistant or flame retardant by
incorporation of flame retardants.Nowadays, attempts are being made to produce 
resins having both flame retardant and antistatic
properties combinedly.A number of attempts has been made to incorporate
both an antistatic agent of the polyether-based copolymer
type mentioned above and a flame retardant in
thermoplastic resins or incorporate both an antistatic
agent of said surfactant type and said flame retardant
in such resins. However, no satisfactory result has
been obtained in either case. It is a sort of common
sense in the art that resin compositions having satisfactory
levels of flame retardancy and antistatic
property, to say nothing of durable antistatic
property, in good valance can never be obtained.Thus, for example, when an antistatic agent, e.g.
a polyether ester (amide) condensate or a polyether
copolymer such as mentioned above, and a flame retardant
are added to a resin, the resulting composition
fails to show satisfactory flame retardancy or, in
other words, to meet the requirements of the relevant
UL (Underwriters' Laboratories) standard, since the
antistatic agent itself contains a large proportion of
ether oxygen and, hence, is very readily combustible
even in the presence of a flame retardant.When a flame retardant and a surfactant are used
combinedly, a certain level of flame retardancy can be
obtained. However, since the surfactant produces an 
antistatic effect as a result of its migration to the
surface, said effect can hardly be maintained for a
prolonged period of time. In many cases, the
surfactant interacts with the flame retardant,
resulting in failure to produce any significant effect.Thus, as mentioned previously, it is common
