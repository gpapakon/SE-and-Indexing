<DESCRIPTION>
This a a continuation-in-part of copending application 
Ser. No. 08/218,200 filed on March 28, 1994, now pending, which 
is a continuation of Ser. No. 08/096,978 filed on July 27, 
1993, now abandoned. The present invention relates to a semiconductor device 
having a thyristor structure comprising four layers alternately 
different in conductivity types and further having two MISFETs 
for turning on/off purposes. The parent US patent application Ser. No. 08/218,200 
discloses a semiconductor device having a thyristor structure 
comprising a first semiconductor region of a first conductivity 
type, a second semiconductor region of a second conductivity 
type, a third semiconductor region of the first conductivity 
type and a fourth semiconductor region of the second 
conductivity type, and further having a first MISFET for making 
majority carriers injectable into the second semiconductor 
region and a second MISFET capable of being turned on and off 
independently of the first MISFET and of extracting the 
majority carriers from the third semiconductor region, the 
fourth semiconductor region being divided into the source 
region of the first MISFET, and the source region of the second  
 
MISFET formed in a portion isolated from the source region of 
the first MISFET. More specifically, as shown in Fig. 2, a p⁺-type (first 
conductivity type) semiconductor substrate provided with a 
collector electrode (anode electrode) 1 on its undersurface, is 
a collector layer (first semiconductor region) 2, and an n⁻-type 
(second conductivity type) base layer (second 
semiconductor region) 3 is epitaxially grown on the collector 
layer 2. In this case, an n⁺-type buffer layer may be provided 
between the collector layer 2 and the base layer 3. Moreover, 
a base layer (third semiconductor region) 4 in the form of a p-type 
well is formed by diffusion on the surface of the n⁻-type 
base layer 3. Further, a first emitter layer 51, a second 
emitter layer 52 and a drain layer 6, all of which are 
independent of each other and in the form of an n⁺-type well, 
are formed on the inside surface of the p-type base layer 4. 
Of these layers, the n⁺-type emitter layers 51 and 52 in a 
fourth semiconductor region are mutually connected via emitter 
electrodes 71 and 72, and a short-circuiting electrode 8 is 
straddlingly connected to the p-type base layer 4 and the n⁺-type 
drain layer 6. Further, a first gate electrode 10 of 
polycrystal silicon forming a first MOSFET 12 is installed via 
a gate oxide film 9 over the
