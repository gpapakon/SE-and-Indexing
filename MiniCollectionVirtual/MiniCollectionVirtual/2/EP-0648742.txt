<ABSTRACT>
An improved process for the reaction of acetonitrile and 
hydrogen sulfide to produce thioacetamide, wherein a 

polymer-supported amine catalyst is used. Examples of 
the polymer-supported amine catalyst are polymeric 

dimethylaminopyridine resins, poly(4-vinylpyridine) 
cross-linked with divinylbenzene, and cross-linked 

polymer-supported 4-(N-benzyl-N-methylamino)pyridine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides an improved 
process for the production of thioacetamide from 
hydrogen sulfide and acetonitrile. Thioacetamide is a commercially available 
chemical having many industrial uses and is a versatile 
reagent for further chemical synthesis. The reaction of 
hydrogen sulfide and acetonitrile to produce 
thioacetamide is well known. U.S. Patent 2,421,031 
discloses the use of a catalyst, 8-14 mesh SiO2Al2O3 gel, 
at a temperature of about 500 °F to obtain yields of 85% 
based on hydrogen sulfide. The reaction is also 
catalyzed by various bases. Jaworski, et al., disclosed 
the use of triethylamine in a 220-hour reaction carried 
out in benzene or toluene (Polish J. Chem., 52(10): 
2067-8, 1978). Girgis disclosed the use of amine 
catalysts, including secondary amines (Canadian Pat. No. 
946,392, 1974; U.S. Pat. No. 3,852,287, 1974; U.S. Pat. 
No. 3,700,664, 1972). More recently, alkyl metal 
sulfides and hydrosulfides have been disclosed as 
catalysts for the reaction of aminonitriles with 
hydrogen sulfide for the production of 
aminothioacetamides (Moder et al., EP 0 272 909). Moder 
et al. prefer these catalysts because the amine base 
catalysts previously used are difficult to remove after 
completion of the reaction. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a high-yielding, cost-effective process to 
prepare thioacetamide with minimal post-reaction 
processing and reusable catalysts. The present invention provides a process for  
 
preparing thioacetamide from hydrogen sulfide and 
acetonitrile in the presence of a polymer-supported 
amine catalyst. The reaction is run under pressure due 
to the use of hydrogen sulfide gas. The reaction 
temperature is not crucial, but for commercially 
reasonable reaction times, it is preferred that the 
temperature be maintained between about 100 and 200 °C, 
although some decomposition of the desired product may 
occur at the higher temperatures. Thus, it is preferred 
that the temperature not exceed 150 °C, and more 
preferably it is maintained between about 120 and 130 
°C. The reactants used in the present invention are 
commercially available. They may be used in essentially 
equimolar amounts or acetonitrile may be used in molar 
excess to hydrogen sulfide. A molar excess of 
acetonitrile will result in a product which is a 
solution of thioacetamide in acetonitrile, which may 
facilitate handling the thioacetamide and may also be 
the desired form of thioacetamide for subsequent 
reaction(s) such as that shown below.
