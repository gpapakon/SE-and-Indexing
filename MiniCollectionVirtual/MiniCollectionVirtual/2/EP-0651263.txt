<ABSTRACT>
In a sequence comprising N radar recurrences, the method consists, in a first stage (31), in making a backwards prediction of an echo for the first P recurrences from echoes received in the last Q recurrences, in a second stage (32), in comparing the echoes actually received in the first P recurrences with the predicted echo, and, in a third stage (33), in determining the order of range ambiguity as a function of the result of the comparison (32), the ambiguity order of an echo being the integer immediately above the highest order of the first recurrences where the difference between the predicted echo and the echo actually received exceeds a threshold at least equal to the prediction noise multiplied by an adjustment factor K. The sum of the numbers P and Q is less than or equal to the number N, and preferably equal to the latter. Application: surveillance or tracking radar.

Method for determining the rank of range
ambiguity of radar echoes within a sequence comprising

a given number N of recurrences, characterized in that
it consists in a first step (31) in making a backward

prediction of an echo (42) for the first P recurrences
on the basis of the echoes received in the last Q

recurrences, in a second step (32) in comparing the
echoes actually received (43) in the first P

recurrences with the predicted echo (42) and in a third
step (33) in determining the rank of range ambiguity as

a function of the result of the comparison of the
second step (32), the rank of ambiguity of an echo

being the integer immediately greater than the highest
rank of the first recurrences where the difference

between the predicted echo (42) and the echo actually
received exceeds a threshold which is at least equal to

the prediction noise multiplied by an adjustment
factor.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the comparison between predicted signals and

received signals is performed by coherent subtraction.
Method according to either one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the sum of the number P

of the first recurrences for which the echo (42) is
predicted and of the number Q of the last recurrences

used for the prediction is equal to the number N of
recurrences of the sequence. 
Method according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the number Q of the last

recurrences is dependent on the largest expected rank
of ambiguity of the echoes received.
Method according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the prediction is derived

from a high-resolution prediction procedure.
Method according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the prediction uses an auto-regressive model of

echoes.
Method according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the threshold is

dependent on the ambient thermal noise.
Method according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the number Q of the

recurrences used for the backward prediction is chosen
to be as large as possible for modelling composite

signals.
Method according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it is applied after the

usual radar processing to the compartments which have
given rise to a detection.
