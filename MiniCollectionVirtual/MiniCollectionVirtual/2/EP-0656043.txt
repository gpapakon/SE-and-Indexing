<ABSTRACT>
Improved polymer compositions, useful in the manufacture of closures and as liners for reclosable container closures, comprising blends of semicrystalline poly(1-butene), ethylene-methylene acrylate, polypropylene random copolymer, wherein the polypropylene random copolymer and the ethylene methyl acrylate can be used singularly or in combination, a lubricating agent and optionally, low density polyethylene. The inventive polymer compositions are recyclable, and do not present the environmental, health, and odor problems associated with polymer liners known in the art.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel blend of
polyolefinic polymers. More particularly, the invention
relates to such a blend which is useful in the manufacture
of composite closures and as the liner for reclosable
container closures.Plastic closures and liners, and methods of
producing these closures and liners are known in the art.
These liners are typically used as liners for the closure
of a reclosable glass or plastic container, especially glass
or plastic bottles. The liners provide sealability and
sealing integrity under top loading conditions, and easy
reclosability. Sealing integrity can be defined as the
force required to effectively seal a container while
maintaining its internal pressure. Generally, a minimal
amount of force is preferred. A satisfactory liner
composition for both glass and plastic containers is
characterized by the ability to be consistently formulated,
and processed, e.g. by compression molding, using
conventional apparatus and methods.Closures are generally required to have a minimal
threshold removal torques, carbonation retention,
carbonation retention under top load and satisfactory
fundtioning on a container when cycled through environmental
changes of temperature and humidity.Most closures and closure liners in commerce are
produced singularly or in combination from a plasticized
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene, EVA copolymer and
an oil-extended thermoplastic elastomer.Blends that have the following properties are
suitable to be used as linear material and for the
manufacture of closures: 
Compression Set< 70%Hardness, Shore A< 85Tensile Yield Strength6894.8 to 13789.5 kPa (1,000 to 2,000 psi)These polymer materials and the closures and
liners made from the previously enumerated polymers have the
following non-exclusive problems or drawbacks.Polyethylene is not soft and elastic enough to
sustain the internal pressure that is generated inside the
bottle or container by the carbonated beverage, and it also
does not have enough creep resistance to provide
reclosability to the closure.Liners or closures made from rubber or elastomeric
blends contain a significant portion of a low molecular
weight mineral oil. The oil in the liner formulation can
be extracted by the contained beverage, and introduce
foreign material into the beverage, and consequently impair
the odor and taste of the beverage.It is known in the art that plasticized PVC has
high removal torque which causes inconvenience to users,
especially elderly users and children. It is known that it
is
