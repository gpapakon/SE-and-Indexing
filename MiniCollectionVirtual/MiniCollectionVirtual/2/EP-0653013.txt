<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an engine using 
compressed air as a power instead of fuel such as 
gasoline or diesel 
according to the preamble of 
claim 1. Generally, power needed for an engine used in a 
vehicle and in industrial machinery is obtained by 
burning gasoline or diesel, which causes an air 
pollution, emission problem. Thus a vehicle driven by electric power is now 
being developed, but until now it has been difficult 
to be widely used because of many problems, especially 
low power or weight. In a four-cycle internal combustion engine a 
cycle including an intake-stroke, a compression-stroke, 
an explosion-stroke and a exhaustion-stroke is 
accomplished while a crank shaft is rotated twice. The explosion stroke occurs just once during 
twice rotation of the crank shaft, which causes 
substantial power loss during the other strokes. Thus 
a fly-wheel is needed for a constant rotation speed of 
the crank shaft. Seen from another aspect, the internal combustion 
engine needs fuel. In order to improve fuel 
consumption ratio an engine using lean mixer is 
developed only to save a little fuel. Further in order to reduce exhaust gas, many 
attempts including exhaust gas recirculation system 
have been done but these attempts require additional 
installations and need much time to accomplish a 
satisfactory purpose.  
 Documents US-A-3.885.387 and DE-A-2.422.672 
relates to apparatus for converting an internal 
combustion engine for operation with a compressed 
non-combustible gas. This apparatus adaptable to an 
internal combustion engine whereby motive power is 
derived from the energy released upon expansion of a 
compressed gas such as air ; it includes a source of 
compressed air, a valving and value actuation 
mechanism and means to introduce the compressed air 
into the cylinders of the engine. The air is 
introduced through the spark plug holes during the 
power stroke of the engine cycle. This apparatus can 
be easily adaptable to a conventional internal-combustion 
engine having not consequently as object 
to provide an engine driven by compressed air which 
is more compact than the corresponding conventional 
internal combustion engine.  
 It is an object of the invention to provide an 
engine which is not driven by burning fuel such as 
gasoline and diesel. It is another object of the invention to provide 
an engine which is more compact than a conventional 
internal combustion engine. To accomplish the above objects, the present 
invention provides an engine as characterized in claim
