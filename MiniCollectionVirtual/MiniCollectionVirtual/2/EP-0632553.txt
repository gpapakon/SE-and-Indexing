<ABSTRACT>
A surface emitting second harmonic generating device capable of generating a second harmonic at room 
temperatures with high efficiency and output power
, and which has a small size, low energy consumption 
and a low manufacturing cost. A second harmonic is efficiently generated when the 〈100〉 direction of 

semiconductor crystals within a cavity makes an angle of 5° or more with respect to the direction of the 
light rays (particularly when one of the 〈111〉, 〈211〉 and 〈110〉 directions approximately matches 

the direction of the light rays). Further, if a second harmonic generating layer composed of a III-V or II-VI 
compound semiconductor is provided between the output end reflector (10) and the spacer layer (6), the 

second harmonic may be generated with even greater efficiency. In addition, the spacer layer may be 
formed by a superlattice, as may the active layer (5) and the spacer layers. A second harmonic may also be 

efficiently generated by utilizing the spacer layer and the active layer as phase-matching layers (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a surface emitting second harmonic generating device, and 
more particularly to a surface emitting second harmonic generating device which is capable of highly efficient 
extraction of a second harmonic (especially monochromatic light, such as violet, blue and green), in a direction 
perpendicular to a substrate. Lasers and light emitting diodes (LEDs) are used as sources of blue light in various fields of 
optoelectronics, such as optical measurement, optical transmission and optical displays. Light-emitting devices 
which use LEDs (particularly those which emit blue light) utilizing GaN semiconductors are known (see, e.g., 
refer to S. Nakamura, T. Mukai and M. Senoh: Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 30 (1991) L1998). However, since 
the line width of LED light is wide (a single wavelength cannot be created), lasers have in recent years been 
more widely used than LEDs in the field of optoelectronics. For example, with some ZnCdSSe semiconductor lasers, an acceptable blue light output is obtainable 
(see, e.g., M.A. Hasse, J. Qiu, J.M. DePuydt and H. Cheng: Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 59 (1991) 1272). 
Nevertheless, under the present circumstances such devices have problems of reliability and usability in 
obtaining a light output at a room temperature. In addition, light-emitting devices that introduce high-power solid laser light or high-power 
semiconductor laser light into non-linear optical crystals (e.g., dielectric substances such as LiNbO3 and KNbO3, 
semiconductors such as GaAs, organic substances, etc.) to generate a second harmonic are known (e.g., refer 
to A. Yariv, Introduction to Optical Electronics, 4th ed.; Saunders College Publishing, (Holt, Rinehart and 
Winston, 1991)). As shown in Fig. 6, in this type of device a laser source 23 and non-linear optical crystals 
24 are arranged between a pair of optical reflectors 21, 22, and laser light is launched through the non-linear 
optical crystals 24 to generate a second harmonic, and blue light is extracted from the reflector 22 which has 
the higher transmission of the second harmonic. However, the larger the size of the device, the greater the cost 
of its production, and since it is composed of a combination of multiple components, its problems include 
extremely difficult control and unstable output. Further, devices are known which extract a second harmonic from the end surface of usual edge-emitting 
GaAs or AlGaAs semiconductor lasers (see, e.g., N. Ogasawara, R. Ito, H. Rokukawa and W.
