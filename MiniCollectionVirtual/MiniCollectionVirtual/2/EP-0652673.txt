<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a method and 
associated apparatus for transforming the color-image 

signals of a color image reproduction system to an 
intermediary image metric, defined in terms of 

colorimetric properties not necessarily corresponding 
to the colorimetric properties associated with either 

the system's input or output device, such that 
nonlinear transformations of individual image-bearing 

signal components, each encoded in terms of the 
intermediary image metric, result in desirable shadow-to-highlight 

characteristics for all colored objects of 
interest.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to
color image reproduction systems and is particularly
directed to a technique for applying nonlinear
transformations to color-image signals in a preferred
manner so as to result in desirable shadow-to-highlight
reproduction for both neutral and colored objects.Color image reproduction systems known in the
art, such as that shown in Fig. 1, permit images to be
captured by certain image-receptive media and/or
devices such as input device 11, possibly digitized and
stored, or output on to one or more image-receptive
media and/or devices such as output device 13. Color-image
signals from input device 11 may be transformed
by transform 14 from the input device's image metric
(i.e. a color image signal metric defined in terms of
the colorimetric properties of the associated image
input device) to a color image metric defined in terms
of the colorimetric properties of a particular output
device such as output device 13. Typically transform
14 involves three-dimensional signal operations in
matrix, three-dimensional look-up-table, or other
forms. Output device 13 may form a reproduced image
from the transformed color-image signals. Those skilled in the art will recognize that
it is often desirable for the color image reproduction
system to create a reproduced neutral scale which
differs from the neutral scale of the original image.
Figure 2 for example shows the nonlinear relationship
between the original scene densities and the densities
reproduced by a typical photographic reflection print
system. It is well known in the photographic art that
such nonlinearities are necessary to compensate for
physical effects such as viewing environment flare
light, dynamic range limitations of the output device,
and limitations of the output medium, as well as to
compensate for psychophysical effects such as lateral
inhibition, local brightness adaptation, etc.When the color image reproduction system's
color-image signals correspond to red, green, and blue
image-bearing signals, the desired reproduced versus
original neutral scale relationship may be achieved by
passing the individual red, green, and blue image
signals through nonlinear transformations such as one-dimensional
look-up-tables. Referring to Fig. 3a,
these nonlinear transformations 14a may typically
operate on color-image signals which are encoded in
terms of the input device image metric. Those skilled
in the art will recognize that an input device image
metric may be defined in terms of the chromaticity
coordinates

<CLAIMS>
A method for transforming color-image signals corresponding to a first set
of color primaries defined by the gamut (41) of an input device (11) to color-image

signals corresponding to a second set of color primaries defined by the colorimetric
properties of an output device (13), characterized by the steps of:


a. transforming the color-image signals corresponding to the first set of color
primaries to form intermediary color-image signals corresponding to a predetermined

third set of color primaries defining colorimetric properties including a chromaticity
gamut (81) which is significantly larger than the chromaticity gamut (41) associated

with the color-image signal values of said input device (11);
b. applying one or more non-linear transforms to said intermediary color-image
signals defined by said enlarged gamut (81) to form modified intermediary

color-image signals; and
c. transforming said modified intermediary color-image signals to form color-image
signals corresponding to said second set of color primaries associated with

the gamut of said output device (13).
