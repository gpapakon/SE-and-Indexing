<ABSTRACT>
The proposal relates to a journal bearing (17) for linearly guided moving units with a housing and a roller (20) containing a roller bearing (26) fitted on an eccentric pin (28) rotatably fitted in the housing and securable by clamping means (1). The housing (18a, 18b) consists of two, preferably identical, halves (18a, 18b). The axial position of the roller (20) is determined by internal wall regions (46) of the housing halves (18a, 18b) which are placed or pressed together after the roller (20) has been radially adjusted by clamping the housing halves (18a, 18b) together on the faces of the inner race (27) of the roller (20). Thus the axial position of the rollers (20) is directly set via their inner race (27).

<CLAIMS>
Supporting bearing (17) for linearly guided
travelling units (14), having a housing which can be

fastened on a basic body (15) of the travelling unit (14)
by means of screws (21), and having at least one roller

(20) which contains a rolling-contact bearing (26) and of
which the inner raceway (27) is seated on an eccentric

bolt (28) which is mounted rotatably in the housing for
radial adjustment of the roller (20)and can be fixed in

the adjusted position by clamping means (31, 32), and
further having means for eliminating the axial play

and/or for fixing the axial position of the roller in the
housing, the housing of the supporting bearing (17) being

divided, transversely with respect to the axis of the
roller (20), into two housing halves (18a, 18b) which are

each provided with a bearing bore (29) for the eccentric
bolt or bolts (28), and the axial position of the roller

(20) being fixed by inner wall regions (46) of the
housing halves (18a, 18b), characterized in that, for the

purpose of fixing the axial position, the housing halves
(18a, 18b) are laid or pressed against the end sides of

the inner raceway (27) of the roller (20) after radial

adjustment of the roller (20), by clamping the housing
halves (18a, 18b) together.
Supporting bearing according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the two housing halves (18a, 18b) are of 

the same construction.
Supporting bearing according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the housing halves (18a, 18b) can

be clamped together by the fastening screws (21) serving
to fasten the supporting bearing (17) on the basic body

(15) of the travelling unit (14), and are configured
and/or dimensioned such that, at least on one housing

half (18a, 18b), the inner wall region (46) located
opposite the inner raceway (27) of the roller (20) is

deformed inwards upon tightening of the screws (21) by
the torque prescribed for the final assembly.
Supporting bearing according to Claim 3, characterized
by the following features:


a) the two housing halves (18a, 18b) are configured such
that they butt directly against one another only on two

opposite side borders (36a, 36b),
b) the through-passage bores (47, 48) which are provided
in the housing halves (18a, 18b) and are intended for the

fastening screws (21) are arranged between the bearing
bores (29) and the abutting side borders (36a, 36b),
c) formed on each housing half (18a, 18b) is a stop
surface (46) which surrounds the inner opening of the

bearing bore (29) and of which the mutual axial spacing
(L), when the housing halves (18a, 18b) are butting

against one another in a non-braced state, corresponds at
least to the length of the inner raceway (27) of the

roller (20) plus an amount of play which permits rotation
of the eccentric bolt (28).
Supporting bearing according to Claim 4, characterized
in that the stop surfaces (46) which surround the

inner openings of the bearing bores (29) are formed on
collar-like extensions (45) of the housing halves (18a,

18b).
Supporting bearing according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that in order to fix

the eccentric bolt (28) in the adjusted position there is
provided a bracing screw (31), of which the operatingside

end portion (33) is located in an outer cutout (34)
of one housing half (18a) and which is rotatably mounted 

in a nut (32) which is retained in an inner cutout of the
housing half (18a) such that it is secured with respect

to rotation and axial displacement.
Supporting bearing according to one of the
preceding claims, having at least one dirt scraper which

consists of felt and is mounted in a displaceable and
spring-loaded manner in a guide shaft of the housing,

characterized in that the dirt scraper (25) is provided
with border shoulders (54, 55) which, interacting with

mating shoulders (56, 57) on the housing (18a, 18b),
prevent undesired escape of the dirt scraper (25) out of

the guide shaft (50, 51).
Supporting bearing according to one of the
preceding claims, for fastening on a basic body which is

formed by an extruded profile and is provided with
longitudinal grooves for receiving hammer nuts, characterized

in that the housing (18a, 18b) of the supporting
bearing (17) is provided, on the assembly surface, with

holes (24) for plugging in guide elements (23) which
serve to adjust the supporting bearing (17) on the basic

body (15) and fit into the grooves (16).
