Process for signalling the call number in a 
telecommunication network, telecommunication connections 

being routed from telecommunication terminal equipment on 
the transmission side (A) via an origin node (ON), via 

transit nodes (TN1, ... TN7) to telecommunication 
terminal equipment on the reception side (B), there being 

inserted into first signalling information of the telecommunication 
connection to be set up a node number 

designating the origin node (ON), the call number of the 
telecommunication terminal equipment on the transmission 

side (A), a node identity number, assigned to the telecommunication 
terminal equipment on the reception side 

(B) and entered into the telecommunication terminal 
equipment on the transmission side (A), and the (B) call 

number, characterized in that in the nodes (ON, TN1, ... 
DN) involved in the setup of the connection it is checked 

on the basis of the node number of the origin node and on 
the basis of the identity number (KDN) of the telecommunication 

terminal equipment on the reception side (B) 
whether the call number of the telecommunication terminal 

equipment on the transmission side (A) is to be supplemented 
by the identity number of the respective node (ON, 

TN1, ... DN), and in that the call number of the telecommunication 
terminal equipment on the transmission side 

(A) is supplemented in the origin node (ON) by the 
identity number (KON) designating the origin node (ON) 

and is not supplemented in the nodes (TN1, ... DN) 
following the origin node (ON) by the identity numbers 

(KTN1, ... KDN) designating these nodes (TN1, ... DN). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in  
 

that, after the setup of the telecommunication connection 
from the telecommunication terminal equipment on the 

transmission side (A) to the telecommunication terminal 
equipment on the reception side (B), second signalling 

information is formed, which is transmitted from the 
telecommunication terminal equipment on the reception 

side (B) to that on the transmission side (A) with the 
call number of the telecommunication terminal equipment 

on the reception side (B), in that in the nodes (DN, TN7, 
... ON) involved in the setup of the connection it is 

checked on the basis of the identity number (KDN) of the 
destination node (DN) and on the basis of the node number 

of the origin node (ON) whether the call number of the 
telecommunication terminal equipment on the reception 

side (B) is to be supplemented by the identity number 
(KDN, KTN7 ... KON) of the respective node (DN, TN7, ... 

ON), and in that the call number of the telecommunication 
terminal equipment on the reception side (B) is supplemented 

in the origin node (DN), representing the second 
signalling information, by the identity number (KDN) 

designating this node (DN) and is not supplemented in the 
nodes (TN7, ... ON) following this node (DN) with respect 

to the second signalling information by the identity 
numbers (KTN7, ... KON) designating these nodes (TN7, 

...ON).
