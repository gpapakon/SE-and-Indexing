<ABSTRACT>
Described is an indexing device for indexing magazine compartments and wafer-shaped objects in the compartments. The aim of the invention is to ensure that a removal and insertion device has precise access to the magazine in any given plane, independent of dimensional tolerances. The invention calls for the measurement beam (10) of an optoelectronic sensor consisting of an emitter (7) and a receiver (8) to be used to determine not only the locations of the objects (13) but also the locations of the compartments (12) relative to a reference plane (E-E) whose location is defined with respect to a handling plane (H-H) for removal and feed. The height of the magazine (11) can be altered by measured amounts by means of a support platform (2) and a lift to permit removal and insertion of objects. The invention is intended for use in the manufacture of integrated circuits, and in particular for handling wafer-shaped objects.

<CLAIMS>
A device for indexing compartments of a magazine
and disc-shaped objects, particularly semiconductor

discs and master discs, contained therein, for
processing whereof the magazine (11) is adjustable as

to height, via a lift, by a magazine holder (2)
belonging to a disc manipulating device, the adjustment

being measurable relative to a first manipulating plane
(H-H) for withdrawal and loading, the device comprising

an opto-electronic sensor comprising a transmitter (7)
and receiver (8), the measuring beam (10) from the

sensor detecting the position of the disc-shaped
objects (13) relative to a reference plane (E-E),

characterised in that the measuring beam (10) also
detects the position of the magazine compartments (12)

relative to the reference plane (E-E), and the
reference plane (E-E) in the disc manipulating device

are in a constant relation, determined by the
construction, to the first manipulating plane (H-H).
A device according to claim 1, characterised in
that the measuring beam (10) leaving the transmitter

(7) and with its centre ray in the reference plane (E-E)
travels between facing walls (14, 15) containing the

magazine compartments (12) and is directed on to
compartment-forming projections (17) from one wall (14,

15) which point towards the interior of the magazine
(11) and obscure the measuring beam (10) and support

the disc-shaped objects (13), and the height adjustment
in the direction of the superposed magazine

compartments (12), which consequently successively
occupy the same position as the reference plane (E-E),

results in generation of an image both of the magazine 
compartments (12) and of the disc-shaped objects (13)

in the magazine compartments, through modulation of the
measuring beam (10).
A device according to claim 1 or according to
claim 2, characterised in that for the purpose of

positioning disc-shaped objects (20) projecting from
the magazine (11) a disc return device (21) is provided

in a second manipulating plane parallel to the first
manipulating plane (H-H) and operates in dependence on

a signal from a second sensor (24) whose measuring beam
is directed parallel to the disc-shaped object (13, 20)

and, during adjustment of the magazine (11) as to
height, is immediately adjacent the side thereof used

for withdrawal and loading.
