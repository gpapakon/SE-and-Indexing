<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that various members of the steroid/thyroid superfamily of receptors can interact to form multimeric species comprising a complex of more than one receptor. Accordingly, the interaction of a first receptor species with a second receptor species modulates the ability of the first receptor species to trans-activate transcription of genes maintained under hormone expression control in the presence of the cognate ligand for said first receptor.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MULTIMERIC FORMS OF MEMBERS OF THE STEROID/THYROID SUPERFAMILY OF RECEPTORSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to interactions between members of the steroid/thyroid superfamily of receptor proteins, novel combinations of various members of the steroid/thyroid superfamily of receptor proteins, and methods of using such combinations.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTranscriptional regulation of development and homeostasis in complex eukaryotes, including humans and other mammals, birds, fish, insects, and the like, is controlled by a wide variety of regulatory substances, including steroid and thyroid hormones. These hormones exert potent effects on development and differentiation of phylogenetically diverse organisms. The effects of hormones are mediated by interaction with specific, high affinity binding proteins referred to as receptors.A number of receptor proteins are known, each specific for steroid hormones [e.g. , estrogens (estrogen receptor) , progesterones (progesterone receptor) , glucocorticoid (glucocorticoid receptor) , androgens (androgen receptor) , aldosterones (mineralocorticoid receptor) , vitamin D (vitamin D receptor) ] , retinoids (e.g., retinoic acid receptor) or thyroid hormones (e.g., thyroid hormone receptor. Receptor proteins have been found to be distributed throughout the cell population of complex eukaryotes in a tissue specific fashion.Molecular cloning studies have made it possible to demonstrate that receptors for steroid, retinoid and thyroid hormones are all structurally related and comprise a superfamily of regulatory proteins. These regulatory 

 proteins are capable of modulating specific gene expression in response to hormone stimulation by binding directly to cis-acting elements.An important advance in the characterization of this superfamily of regulatory proteins has been the identification of a growing list of gene products which possess the structural features of hormone receptors.It is known that steroid or thyroid hormones, protected forms thereof, or metabolites thereof, enter cells and bind to the corresponding specific receptor protein, initiating an allosteric alteration of the protein. As a result of this alteration, the complex of receptor and hormone (or metabolite thereof) is capable of binding with high affinity to certain specific sites on chromatin.It is also known that many of the primary effects of steroid and thyroid hormones involve increased transcription of a subset of genes in specific cell types.A number of transcriptional
