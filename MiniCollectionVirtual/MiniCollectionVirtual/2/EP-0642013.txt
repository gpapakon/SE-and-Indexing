<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for sensing the deflection of a beam 
(14) directed at an article (16) detects slight 

deflection of the beam (14) when the beam (14) is 
directed at a large angle of incidence. The large 

angle of incidence increases the apparatus sensitivity 
to detect certain characteristics within an article 

(16) which cause slight deflection, and allows the use 
of smaller optical elements. The apparatus can 

detect defects such as coating voids, streaks, 
and caliper variations when transparent materials are 

coated onto transparent substrates.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to systems for detecting 
the deflection of a beam when the beam is directed at 
an article. More particularly, this invention relates 
to systems for detecting defects in moving articles, 
such as webs or films, by detecting the deflection of 
a beam directed at the article. Detection of defects during production of 
articles, such as coated films or webs, allows the 
operator to take prompt corrective action to maximize 
quality. Fast corrective action is particularly 
important in the production of continuous articles. 
Removal or correction of defects in continuous 
articles can be difficult, and it is often 
economically prohibitive to separate sections with 
defects from the defect-free sections of that article. 
Defects in the center of a wound web or film may 
require a laborious secondary process to remove the 
defective sections and to splice the non-defective 
sections back together. If the web or film is later 
converted into discrete products, high converting 
waste can result. In either case, removal of 
defective sections is often not cost-effective and can 
result in the waste and disposal of the entire wound 
web or film. Effective detection of defects can allow the 
operator to quickly mark the defects for the secondary 
removal process. Also, the operator can quickly 
adjust the primary process in which the defect 
originates to eliminate the cause of the defect and to 
minimize defects to an acceptable number. 
Additionally, detection of "pre-defect" symptoms can 
prompt the operator to adjust the process to avoid 
defects prior to their formation. The operator taking 
the corrective action can be human or automatic.  Apparatus to detect defects are well known. One 
type of defect-detecting apparatus is an image 
analyzer which compares an image of the article being 
inspected with either another image of the article or 
a programmed image. When the images contrast, the 
apparatus may consider the irregularity a defect. 
This type of apparatus can be very expensive depending 
on the sensitivity required and the type of defects 
being detected. Another type of defect-detecting apparatus is 
the line scanning system. This system includes a 
laser beam, for example, which is repeatedly directed 
across the article being inspected. One embodiment of 
this system includes a photodetector which measures 
the intensity level of the beam after the beam passes 
through the article. When the beam is deflected by 
the article, its intensity is reduced and detected by 
the

An apparatus for detecting defects in 
an article which cause the deflection of a scanning 

beam when the beam is directed at the article 
comprising: 

   means for directing a scanning beam at the 
article at a large angle of incidence to produce an 

increased deflection of the beam when it strikes a 
defect in the article as compared with the deflection 

of a beam directed at a small angle of incidence; 
   means for stopping the beam when the beam is 

not sufficiently deflected by the defect in the 
article; and 

   means for collecting the beam when the beam 
is deflected sufficiently off course by striking the 

defect such that the beam is not stopped by the 
stopping means, but not deflected beyond the perimeter 

of the collecting means. 
The apparatus of claim 1, further 
comprising a scanning beam which is a laser beam 

having a wavelength which is selected in combination 
with the composition of the article being inspected, 

and wherein the collecting means comprises at least 
one photodetector. 
The apparatus of claim 1 or 2, further 
comprising means for moving the article relative to 

the scanning beam. 
The apparatus of any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the 
directing means comprises a scanner which directs the 

beam across a desired angular scanning range and which 
directs the beam across the article at a large angle 

of incidence. 
The apparatus of claim 4, wherein the 
directing means further comprises means for creating 

consistency of the angle of the beam across the entire 
article by focusing the angular scanning range of the 

beam created by the scanner into a generally parallel 
scanning range before the beam has either struck a 

defect or passed through or reflected from the 
article. 
The apparatus of claim 5, further 
comprising means for converging the parallel scanning 

range of the beam into an angular range after the beam 
has either struck a defect or passed through or 

reflected from the article to allow for the use of 
smaller stopping means and smaller collecting means 

without reducing sensitivity. 
The apparatus of claim 6, wherein the 
converging means comprises a concave mirror, wherein 

the consistency-creating means comprises a concave 
mirror, wherein the stopping means comprises a plate 

located at the focal point of the converging angular 
range, and wherein the collecting means sends a signal 

indicating the presence of a defect.

variations in an article which cause slight deflection 

of a laser beam when the laser beam strikes a defect 
in the article, comprising: 

   a laser beam; 
   a lens to focus the laser beam; 

   a scanner which scans the laser beam focused 
by the lens across a desired angular range; 

   a first concave mirror which receives the 
laser beam from the scanner, converts the angular 

range of the laser beam to a parallel range so that 
the beam is directed at the entire surface of the 

 
article at the same angle of incidence, and focuses 

the parallel range of the beam across the moving 
article at a large angle of incidence with the surface 

of the article to produce an increased deflection of 
the laser beam when it strikes a defect in the article 

as compared with the deflection from the same defect 
of a laser beam directed at a small angle of 

incidence; 
   a second concave mirror which receives the 

laser beam from the first concave mirror after the 
beam has either struck a defect or passed through or 

reflected from the article, and which converts the

the laser beam has been sufficiently deflected to 
avoid striking the second mirror;

from the second concave mirror when the beam is not 

deflected or sufficiently deflected by the defect or 
variation to avoid the plate, but wherein the plate 

will not stop a beam which has been deflected outside 
of the perimeter of the plate due to the sufficiently 

large angle of incidence at which the laser beam is 
directed toward the article; and 

   a photodetector which can collect the beam 
which was reflected from the second concave mirror 

after striking the defect and being deflected 
sufficiently off course such that the beam was not 

stopped by the plate, but not deflected beyond the 
perimeter of the photodetector.

   a lens to focus the laser beam; 

   a scanner which scans the laser beam focused 
by the lens across a desired angular range; 

   a first concave mirror which receives the

the beam is directed at the entire surface of the 

article at the same angle of incidence, and focuses 
the parallel range of the beam across the moving 

article at a large angle of incidence with the surface 
of the article to produce an increased deflection of 

the laser beam when it strikes a defect in the article 
as compared with the deflection from the same defect 

of a beam directed at a small angle of incidence;
