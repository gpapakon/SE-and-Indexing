<ABSTRACT>
Exhaust purifying filter material which can carry a 
larger amount of catalyst and from which the catalyst will 

not easily drop off even if subjected to vibrations or 
temperature changes due to repeated heating and cooling at 

high temperatures. Catalyst is carried on alumina whiskers 
formed on metal fiber having a composition of Fe-Ni-Cr-Al, 

Fe-Cr-Al or Ni-Cr-Al or woven or unwoven fabric formed of 
the metal fiber. The catalyst is firmly carried by the 

alumina whiskers. The amount of catalyst carried is 
increased with the increase in surface area.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
a method of
manufacturing a filter material for purifying an exhaust gas.In an exhaust purifying device of a car or a kerosene
fan heater, a precious metal (such as platinum) is used as
a catalyst to purify exhausts by chemically reacting them
with the catalyst. The catalyst is carried on the surface
of a carrier such as a honeycomb made of Cordierite.A conventional catalyst carrier of this type had a
relatively smooth surface and was thus low in catalyst-carrying
capacity.Recent car engines and kerosene burners produce high-temperature
exhausts compared with older models due to
improved fuel combustion technology. When exposed to such
high-temperature exhausts, the catalyst carried on a
conventional catalyst carrier tends to drop off soon while
the heating-cooling cycle is repeated, so that the exhaust-capacity
cannot be maintained for a long time. Prior art is a filter material for purifying an exhaust gas
comprising a substrate formed of metal fiber or fabric of said
metal fiber (EP-A-0 415 835). Further, a system is known for
purifying exhaust gas comprising a metal foil, wherein alumina
whiskers are grown (GB-A-2 063 723).Further prior art is a method of manufacturing a filter material
for purifying an exhaust gas by the steps of diffusing
aluminum on a mesh-like metallic porous member (woven fabric)
(WO-A-94/06538 = EP-A-0 626 188)(falling within the terms of Art.54(3)EPC). It is an object of this invention to provide a method for manufacturing
a exhaust purifying filter material which can carry a greater amount
of catalyst stably even if subjected to vibrations or 
temperature changes due to repeated heating and cooling
under a high-temperature condition.In order to achieve this object, the method is characterized
by the steps according to claim 1.The term "unwoven fabric" herein used refers to a
thin cloth formed by bonding metal fibers, which are simply
aggregated without being formed into yarns, and compressing
them. Instead of bonding with adhesive, the metal fibers
may be mechanically or otherwise connected together.If the metal fiber has a composition of an Fe-Ni-Cr-Al,
Fe-Cr-Al, or Ni-Cr-Al, alumina whisker should be formed
by heating the metal fiber to 800-1000°C in the atmosphere
or in an oxidizing atmosphere (e.g. in a mixture of Ar and
O2 gases).Metal fiber of Fe-Ni-Cr-Al or Fe-Cr-Al can be
obtained by diffusion-alloying a stainless steel (known under Trademark) SUS316
fiber, an Fe-Cr metal fiber or their woven or unwoven
fabric to add Al. The
