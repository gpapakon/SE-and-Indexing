<ABSTRACT>
In order to operate in a functionally reliable manner, specific electronic controllers operating in an AC circuit, especially specific dimmers for brightness control of lamps, require a basic load which ensures a minimum load current via the controller. The invention creates a method and a circuit arrangement in which an active basic load (AG) is used as the basic load, which is controlled such that the minimum load current passing via the basic-load impedance (resistance, resistor) (RGL) flows only in the blocking phase (flyback phase, inhibiting phase) of the controller (ST).
