<ABSTRACT>
A mechanism (10) for releasing high pressure fluid
from a pressure vessel has a connecting member (12) for

connecting to the pressure vessel, a support sleeve (20),
a sealing disk (35), supporting means which may be a trap

door (50), a rotatable column (68), or a support
plug (78) and a protractor (32) or retractor (80) for

selectively removing the supporting means and thus
opening the sealing disk. The sealing disk can also be

opened spontaneously, operating as a relief valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to mechanisms for releasing fluid from a pressure vessel.Various technologies such as inflatable vehicle occupant restraints and fire
suppression systems require the rapid release of pressurised fluid from a pressure vessel. It
is known to provide a relatively weak burst disk, unable by itself to withstand the internal
pressure of the pressurised fluid, which is in turn supported by a structural support. When
it is desired to release the pressurised fluid from the pressure vessel, the structural support
is somehow removed or broken allowing the burst disk to burst. Various methods are
known for removing the structural support and include, manual actuation, thermal
actuation, hydraulic/pneumatic actuation, actuation by a mechanical acceleration sensor,
and actuation by an unconfined pyrotechnic device. A pyrotechnic device uses an
explosive pyrotechnic material. Typically, the explosive pyrotechnic material is ignited by
an electric signal. For unconfined pyrotechnic devices, which are the only ones known to
be used in the art, the products of combustion are released outside of the pyrotechnic
device.US Patent 4203616 discloses an entirely mechanical air bag device for cars wherein
a frangible lid seals a container having gas under pressure therein. The frangible lid is
supported by a pressing lid in contact with a link mechanism. During a crash, an impact
detecting assembly releases the link mechanism which in turn releases the pressing lid
which permits the frangible lid to be fractured by the high pressure gas to inflate the bag. According to the invention there is provided a
release mechanism as set out in claim 1 of the claims
appended hereto.
Preferred embodiments of the invention
are defined in the dependent claims.

<CLAIMS>
A mechanism (10) for releasing fluid from a pressure vessel having an opening, the
mechanism comprising:


connecting member (12) for connecting the mechanism to the opening in the pressure
vessel, said connecting member having an opening;
a support sleeve (20; 63; 73; 92) having first and second ends (21, 22) and an axial
opening (24; 63; 74; 93);
a sealing disk (35) for sealing said opening of said connecting member, said sealing
disk interposed between said connecting member and said first end (21) of said support

sleeve;
supporting means (50, 54; 68; 78; 98) for supporting said sealing disk, said supporting
means positioned within said axial opening of said support sleeve;
first opening means (32) for selectively opening said sealing disk;
second opening means for opening said sealing disk (35), said second opening means
being arranged to open said sealing disk (35) spontaneously in the event that the fluid in the

vessel exceeds a set pressure;

   
characterised in that
 said axial opening (24; 63; 74; 93) has a first diameter (D5) and
said supporting means (50, 54; 68; 78; 98) has a second diameter (D4) smaller than said

first diameter (D5) such that said sealing disk (35) is unsupported across part of said axial opening beyond the second
diameter (D4), thus forming said second opening means.
The mechanism of claim 1
wherein said second diameter (D4) is in the range of 50-99% of said first diameter, (D5).
The mechanism (10) of
claim 1 further comprising a thrust diverter (40; 65; 75; 95) for balancing thrust to the

pressure vessel, said thrust diverter being attached to said second end (22) of said support
sleeve (20; 62; 73; 92) and having a plurality of holes for diffusing the high pressure fluid

from the pressure vessel. 
The mechanism (10) of
claim 1 wherein said first opening means comprises a protractor (32) for selectively

removing said supporting means (50, 54), said protractor responding to an electrical signal.
The mechanism (10) of
claim I wherein said supporting means comprises a hinge pin (52) attached to said support

sleeve (20) and, a trap door (50) selectively pivotable about said hinge pin.
The mechanism (10) of
claim 5 wherein said supporting means further comprises a slidable support member (100),

said slidable support member selectively removing support from said trap door (50).
The mechanism (10) of claim
1 wherein said supporting means comprises a pillar (98) having a groove (99) around its

circumference.
The mechanism (10) of
claim 7 wherein said supporting means further comprises a slidable support member (100)

receivable within said groove of said pillar (98).
The mechanism (10) of
claim 3 wherein said thrust diverter (40) has a female keyway, said supporting means

comprising a column (68) having a first wing (69), said first wing receivable within said
female keyway, said column selectively rotatable within said axial opening (24) of said

support sleeve (20).
The mechanism (10) of
claim 3 wherein said thrust diverter (40) has a cavity, said opening means comprising a

retractor (80) for selectively removing said supporting means (50, 54), said retractor fitting
within said cavity in said thrust diverter. 
The mechanism (10) of
claim 5 wherein said connecting member is substantially cylindrical with a diameter D1,

said support sleeve is substantially cylindrical with a diameter D2 and said thrust diverter is
substantially cylindrical with a diameter D3.
