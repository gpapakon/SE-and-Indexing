<ABSTRACT>
The intention is to provide a sandwich panel, comprising at least two metallic outer sheets 5, 7 and an intermediate layer 14, with a connecting hole running substantially transversely to the plane of the panel. This is performed by the hole having a thin-walled grommet in the form of a sleeve 8 which is sealed with respect to the intermediate layer and merges seamlessly with the outer layers 5, 7 of the sandwich panel 2. In a method for making connecting holes in a sandwich panel which comprises at least two metallic outer sheets and an intermediate layer, the connecting holes running substantially transversely to the plane of the panel, the connecting holes are produced by flow-boring into the sandwich panel from one side of the panel, a sleeve 8 being formed in the circumferential region of each connecting hole from the outer sheets 5, 7, which sleeve seals the connecting hole with respect to the intermediate layer 14 of the sandwich panel 2.

A sandwich plate consisting of at least two metallic 
cover plates (5, 7) and an intermediate layer (14) 

which comprises a connecting bore extending 
substantial
ly transversely to the plate plane, with the 
bore comprising a thin-walled jacket part in the form 

of a sleeve (8) which is sealed towards the 
intermediate layer,
 
characterised in
 
that the sleeve (8) formed out of the cover plates (5, 

7) passes seamlessly into the cover plates (5, 7) of 
the sandwich plate (2), with the cover plates and the 

sleeve of the connecting bore forming a uniform 
workpiece. 
A sandwich plate according to claim 1,
 
characterised in
 
that the cover plates (5, 7) of the sandwich plate (2) 

consist of an age-hardenable aluminium material whose 
structure in the region of the sleeve (8) of the 

connecting bore is present in the strengthened 
condition. 
A method of forming connecting bores in a sandwich 
plate consisting of at least two metallic cover plates 

(5, 7) and an intermediate layer (14), with the 
connecting bores extending substantially transversely 

to the plate plane,
  
 

characterised in
 
that the connecting bores are flow-drilled into the 

sandwich plate from one plate end and that, in the 
circumferential region of each connecting bore, a 

sleeve (8) is formed out of the cover plates (5, 7), 
which sleeve (8) sealingly closes the connecting bore 

towards the intermediate layer (14) of the sandwich 
plate (2). 
A method according to claim 3,
 
characterised in
 
that the sleeve (8) forms a collar (11) which extends 

beyond the cover plate (7) and which is smoothed by a 
suitable forming tool. 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in
 
that the forming tool consists of a flow-drill which 

comprises a step (9) with an increased diameter and 
which, after the sleeve (8) has been formed, is 

introduced from the other plate end into the connecting 
bore and is pressed by means of the step (9) against 

the collar (11) of the sleeve (8). 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in
 
that, during the flow-drilling operation, the sandwich 

plate (2) is supported at the plate end opposed to the 
flow drill (1). 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in
 
that the sandwich plate is supported by a supporting 

plate (3a, b) which surrounds the connecting bore on 
all sides and which is connected to a holding-down 

device (4a, b) arranged on the upper face of the plate.
