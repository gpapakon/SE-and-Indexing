<ABSTRACT>
A solar panel unit includes a solar panel (10) supported for rotation about a frame (13) and driven around the frame (13) by an electric motor (14). Radiation sensors (22) and (23) have their planar axes equally and oppositely off-set from the planar axis of the panel (10). Signals from the sensors (22) and (23) are monitored and used to control the operation of the motor (14) such that the panel (10) moves as the sun moves during daylight hours and the panel remains with its planar axis at right angles to rays of the sun throughout the day.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to solar lamps.The invention relates more particularly to a solar panel
unit for a solar lamp.Normally, the solar panel converts solar energy during the
day time into electrical power to charge up or to maintain
a charge in a battery power pack which supplies the lamp
during the night as required.Customarily, the panel is oriented to be directly facing
the sun, that is a with its planar surface at least
approximately perpendicular to the direction of the sun
at, say, noon each day. The conversion of solar energy by
a solar panel is most efficient in this position but as
the sun moves throughout the daylight hours, the panel is
for most of the day operating at considerably less than
its optimum efficiency.DE-U-90 06 449 discloses a solar panel arrangement which
can be orientated to follow the path of the sun. An
orientation motor is controlled by a control signals
provided by separate light sensing auxiliary panels which
are off-set from one another. EP-A-0 079 267 discloses a
solar panel arrangement that is arranged to charge a
battery and provide power for a lamp. It is an object of the invention to overcome or at least
reduce this problem.According to the invention there is provided a solar panel
unit comprising a movable solar panel arrangement support
carriage and a drive motor for moving the carriage to
orient the panel arrangement relative to the sunlight into
optimum orientations for receiving solar energy, in which
the panel arrangement comprises first and second main
panels to convert solar energy into electrical power to
charge up or to maintain a charge in a battery power pack,
in which the first and second main panels are angularly
off-set slightly from one another and from a central mean
optimum orientation of the panel arrangement, including
means for sensing the intensity of solar energy being
converted by the first and second main panels into
respective first and second converted energies and
controlling operation of the motor when there is an
increasing energy difference between the first and second
converted energies which exceeds a predetermined level of
magnitude sufficient to move the panel arrangement towards
optimum orientations as the sun moves relative to the
unit.The carriage may be pivotably supported about an axis and
the motor arranged to move the carriage about the axis,
which axis in use is positioned generally perpendicular to
the radius of the arc of daily movements of the sun. Solar panel units will now be described by way of example
with reference
