<ABSTRACT>
A monolithically integrated optical filter which is rapidly tunable over a 
wide optical frequency range includes an input frequency router (12) connected to an 

output frequency router (22) by means of selectively activatable transceivers (18₁, -- 
18
N
; 26₁ -- 26
N
). The transceivers are formed from optically active sections (18₁ -- 

18
N
) and electronic controllers (26₁ -- 26
N
) that selectively modulate, demodulate 
and amplify a desired one or more of a plurality of multiplexed input optical 

frequencies (on 14). This filter is economical to construct and is useful in high 
capacity, high speed optical communications networks.

Zirngibl entitled "High-Power, Single Frequency Tunable Laser," filed in the 
Patent and Trademark Office on October 13, 1993.  This invention relates to optical communications systems. More 
particularly, this invention relates to integrated optical filters used in optical 
communications systems. The capacity and speed of communications systems may be increased by 
transmitting information in optical form over networks composed of optically 
transmissive nodes, fibers, waveguides, and the like. High capacity optical 
communications systems require that many optical signals be frequency division 
multiplexed in the components of an optical network. Receivers must be 
configured such that a desired optical frequency may be retrieved from a group 
of many multiplexed optical frequencies. This necessitates the provision of 
suitable optical filters which separate and modulate desired optical frequencies 
from a frequency division multiplexed plurality of optical frequencies while also 
selectively modulating, demodulating, and amplifying selected ones of the 
demultiplexes optical frequencies. Until now, there has been no convenient 
approach to
