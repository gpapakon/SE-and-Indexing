<ABSTRACT>
It has been found according to the invention that the arrangement of at least one annular ribbon core (10, 10') as a summing current transformer, and a field coil (20) in the form of a flat annular coil leads to particularly favourable results, the axes (I) of the annular ribbon core (10, 10') and of the field coil (20) running approximately in a colinear manner. In this case, the annular planes (12, 22) of the annular ribbon core (10, 10') and field coil (20) are in close contact with one another. In the case of such an arrangement, a release sensitivity of approximately one mA DC fault current can be achieved, with the transformer having an internal diameter of, for example, 10 mm.

Fault-current detection device for universal 
current, comprising a summation current transformer 

(10) having an associated field coil (20), with the 
field coil (20) having the form of a flat ring coil and 

with the axes (I, II) of the summation current 
transformer (10) and the field coil (20) extending in a 

substantially collinear manner, characterised in that 
the summation current transformer contains at least one 

toroidal tape core (10, 10'), with the centres of 
symmetry of the toroidal tape core (10, 10') and the

other along the substantially collinear axes (I, II), 

and in that at least the toroidal tape core (10, 10') 
is made of a highly permeable magnetic material with a 

flat magnetization characteristic, whereby the magnetic 
field of the ring coil (20) sets up induction in the

longitudinal direction of the tape without any exciting 

magnetic field intensity occurring in the longitudinal 
direction of the tape.
