<ABSTRACT>
The body consists of two essentially symmetrical parts or half-shells (1, 3) which can be joined together in an axial longitudinal plane and can be welded to one another. After being joined together, the two half-shells form threaded segments (40, 42) for the incandescent lamp and hold the insert with the contacts or, directly, the contacts which are accommodated in the corresponding seats.
