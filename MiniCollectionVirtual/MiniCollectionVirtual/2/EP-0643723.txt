<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an improved process for the preparation of a halogenated steroidal diene. The process involves the simultaneous transformation of the steroidal 3-one to 3-halo and 17-carboxylic acid to 17-carboxamide in a single reaction without the isolation of an intermediate. The process takes place by reacting the steroidal starting material with a halogen-Vilsmeier reagent.

<DESCRIPTION>
 "HALOGENATION USING HALO-VILSMEIER REAGENT".Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of substituted steroidal dienes. Such compounds are described in US Patent No. 5,017,568, issued on May 21, 1991 to Holt et al. , as being useful in inhibiting steroid 5-α-reductase.Background nf the Inven ionProcesses for the preparation of substituted steroidal diene'derivatives, have previously been described. In particular the use of oxalyl bromide to convert steroidal α,β-unsaturated-3-ketones to 3-bromo- 3,5-diene intermediates (in 40% yield) followed by catalytic or alkyllithium mediated carboxylation (in 15% yield when N-butyl lithium was used) to yield steroidal- 3,5-diene-3-carboxylic acid derivatives is reported in US Patent No. 5,017,568.in addition to a low overall yield, another shortcoming of this disclosure is that oxalyl bromide is a toxic, expensive liquid which is difficult to store and is not readily available in the bulk amounts needed for an industrial process.The use of oxalyl chloride to halogenate steroidal α,β-unsaturated ketones to chloro-steroidal dienes proceeds with only marginal results. Furthermore, the relatively low reactivity of the resultant chloro substituent poses non-trivial synthetic considerations in subsequent transformations. Thus, there is a need in the art for a safe, economical and reliable method to halogenate steroidal α,β-unsaturated ketones to halc- 1,3-dienes. Preferably, said method will brominate cr iodinate steroidal α,β-unsaturated ketones to their corresponding halo-1, 3-dienes. 

 SUMMARY OF THE TNVENTTONThis invention relates to a process for the halogenation of a compound with multiple functional groups on the same molecule.This invention relates to an improved process for converting steroidal α,β-unsaturated ketones to their corresponding halo-1,3 diene derivatives.This invention relates to an improved process for the formation of acid-halide from a steroidal carboxylic acid substituent followed by nucleophilic displacement of said halide.This invention specifically relates to an improved process for the in situ conversion of steroidal carboxylic acids to steroidal carboxa ides.This invention specifically relates to a process for the simultaneous bromination and amidation of 3-one- 4-ene-17-carboxylic acid steroidal compounds.This invention specifically relates to an improved process for the preparation of N-t-butyl-androst-3,5- diene-17β-carboxamide-3-carboxylic acid.Detailed Description of the Inven innBy
