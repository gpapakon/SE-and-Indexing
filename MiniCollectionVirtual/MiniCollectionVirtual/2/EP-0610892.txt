<ABSTRACT>
A method of treating hair to reduce post-perm 
odor by (1) reducing the degree of reaction between a 

permanent wave reducing agent and a natural compound 
contained in hair, e.g., hair aldehydes; and/or 

(2) altering the malodor of products formed by the 
reaction of hair and a permanent wave reducing agent, 

during the oxidation step; and/or (3) binding a 
fragrance to the hair to mask any odoriferous compounds 

that result from reaction of a reducing agent with the 
hair, or from the reaction of reduced hair with an 

oxidizing agent; and/or (4) change the naturally 
occurring post-perm odor by adding a reducing agent 

reactant during the permanent waving process resulting 
in more pleasant smelling reaction products.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method 
of treating hair to reduce or alter an unpleasant post-perm 
odor associated with the contact of hair with a 
reducing agent or oxidizing agent in permanent waving 
of hair. More particularly, the present invention is 
directed to a method of lessening the amount of 
reaction of a reducing agent with compounds naturally 
present in hair that produce malodor, e.g., hair 
aldehydes, by reacting a portion of the permanent wave 
reducing agent, e.g., cysteamine, with a reactant other 
than an odor-producing hair reactant, e.g., hair 
aldehydes. 
The resulting 
reaction products formed by reaction of (1) the added 
reactant and (2) (a) the reducing agent; and/or (b) a 
malodorous reaction product of the oxidizing agent with 
the reduced hair, substantially lessens the 
objectionable odor otherwise identified with the 
permanent waving process, e.g., more pleasant smelling 
than the common reducing agent/hair aldehyde reaction 
product; or oxidizing agent/reduced hair reaction 
product, normally formed in the permanent waving 
process.  
 In general, permanent waving of human hair is 
achieved by chemically breaking the sulfur to sulfur or 
disulfide cystine bonds occurring naturally in human 
hair and then reforming the cystine bonds while the 
hair is wrapped or curled on rods. The sulfur to 
sulfur cystine bonds in human hair maintain the hair in 
a naturally straight or curly configuration. In order 
to permanently reshape the hair into a lasting, 
different configuration, a significant percentage of 
the sulfur to sulfur bonds must be broken and then 
reestablished after the hair is reconfigured in a 
desired position, such as wrapped around a suitable 
mandrel or roller. In general, the sulfur to sulfur 
cystine bonds are broken with a composition containing 
a reducing agent and after the hair is wound into a 
curl formation around a rod or roller, the sulfur to 
sulfur cystine bonds are relinked or reestablished 
while the hair is in the curl formation by contacting 
the hair in the new formation with an oxidizing agent, 
such as hydrogen peroxide or a water-soluble bromate. It is well known in the art of hair permanent 
waving that conventional reducing agents used in 
permanent waves to alter hair configuration result in a 
characteristic unpleasant odor in the hair. The 
intensity and duration of this unpleasant odor is 
formula dependent, depending, in particular, on the 
reducing agent used in the waving process. 
Conventional waving agents that are

A method of reducing malodor resulting from a reaction 
of a reducing agent with hair while permanently waving 

hair comprising: 

contacting the hair with 0.01 % to 20 % by weight, 
based on the total weight of hair contacted, of an 

aldehyde that is more reactive with the permanent wave 
reducing agent than with natural hair aldehydes; 
contacting the hair, containing said aldehyde, with the 
reducing agent to break cysteine hair bonds while 

reacting a portion of the reducing agent with said 
aldehyde thereby forming a reaction product from the 

reaction of the reducing agent with said aldehyde; and 
said reaction product having a different odor than a 
reaction product formed from the reaction of the reducing 

agent with said hair. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the reducing agent is 
cysteamine. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said aldehyde is an aromatic 
aldehyde. 
The method of claim 3, wherein said aldehyde is benzaldehyde, 
methyl hydrocinnamic aldehyde or combinations 

thereof. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the reactive compound is 
included in the composition in an amount in the range 

of about 0.01 % to 10 % by weight of the composition.  
 
The method of claim 1, wherein the reducing agent-reactive 
compound is more reactive with the reducing agent 

than the aldehydes naturally present in hair. 
A method according to claim 1 of reducing the malodor resulting 
from a reaction of a reducing agent with a hair component while 

permanently waving the hair comprising: 

contacting the hair with 0.05 to 20 % by weight, based 
on the total weight of hair contacted, of an aldehyde 

that is more reactive with the permanent wave reducing 
agent than with natural hair aldehydes; and 
contacting the hair containing said aldehyde, with the 
reducing agent to break cysteine hair bonds while reacting 

a portion of the reducing agent with said aldehyde 
added to the hair, thereby forming a thiazolidine 

derivative reaction product having a less objectionable 

odor than thiazolidines formed from a reaction between 
the reducing agent and natural hair aldehydes.
