<ABSTRACT>
This invention discloses a shower or bath screen comprising a telescopic arm with three attached panes, one of which is adjacent a wall of the bathroom, the other two sliding proportionally in relation to one another to form the screen. The telescopic arm includes a pivoting member (1) attached to the bathroom wall, and two sliding members (2, 3). The proportional displacement of the sliding members is achieved by means of a device comprising a cable (15) attached at its ends to each side of the sliding member (1) and running between two pulleys (20, 21) intergral with the central sliding member (2). Between the two pulleys, the cable (15) is attached at an adjacent point (23) to the third sliding member (3) of the telescopic arm. When sliding member (2) is pulled or pushed, sliding member (3) is proportionally displaced, and conversely.
