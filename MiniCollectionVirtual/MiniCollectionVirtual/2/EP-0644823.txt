<ABSTRACT>
Improvements in the manufacture of multi-layer organic polymer composites are described, particularly applicable to composites including adjacent layers of a relatively water-soluble polymer (e.g. partially hydrolysed polyvinyl alcohol) and a relatively water-insoluble polymer (e.g. fully hydrolysed polyvinyl alcohol). The extruded layers are brought together within the die housing or by nipping means external to the die, or the relatively water-insoluble layer may be coated onto the relatively water-soluble layer. Specific designs of die are claimed, as are specific extrudable compositions and apparatus for conveying the same to the dies. The invention makes available for the first time a range of articles in which plastic parts are water-compatible in normal use but are completely degradable on contact with water during disposal, such as WC-disposable sanitary articles and water-degradable rigid containers for oil and petrol.

<DESCRIPTION>
 POLYMERIC ARTICLES AND MATERIALSField of the InventionThis invention relates to polymeric materials and articles made therefrom, and to methods and apparatus for 5 forming polymeric articles and materials, more particularly polymeric articles and materials which can readily be disposed of when no longer required.BackgroundPolyvinyl acetate is a water-insoluble polymer which is10 obtained by polymerization of vinyl acetate. This polymer is used for the production of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) by hydrolysis or alcoholysis to remove the acetyl groups from polyvinyl acetate. This removal of acetyl groups may be carried to partial completion so as to give15 a product which is a copolymer of vinyl alcohol and vinyl acetate. If vinyl alcohol predominates, but there is still a substantial quantity of vinyl acetate present, such a copolymer is soluble in cold water and is frequently referred to as "partially hydrolysed"20 polyvinyl alcohol. The residual vinyl acetate content is typically about 11 wt% corresponding to about 12 mol%. If the reaction is taken further, close to completion, the crystallinity of the polyvinyl alcohol increases and the solubility in cold water decreases very markedly.25 Material of this type is referred to as "fully hydrolysed" polyvinyl alcohol. Its contents of residual vinyl acetate is typically no greater than 3 mol%.* WO 92/01556 (the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference) describes certain degradable Â» 30 articles, typically in sheet form, in which a water- soluble PVA substrate is protected on its surface against contact with water while the article is in use by means of a polymeric composite structure. However, such structures have hitherto been relatively difficult toSUBSTITUTESHEET 

form. In particular^ we have found that the particular casting/moulding and film-blowing coextrusion processes described and claimed in WO 92/01556 do not provide a satisfactory product.It is an aim of the present invention to provide improvements in the formation of polymeric materials such as those of WO 92/01556.The invention is based on our surprising finding that a polymeric material of the type described in WO 92/01556 can be prepared with substantial and unexpected advantages in terms of efficiency, speed and cost, by extruding the layers through certain particular die arrangements or by a specific multistep forming process. It is to be noted that "cast coextrusion" mentioned herein does not in any way resemble the non-extrusion casting/moulding processes described in WO
