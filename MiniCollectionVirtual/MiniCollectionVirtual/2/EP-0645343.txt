<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a pilot-controlled valve for petrol stations, the valve gate is composed of two casing parts (10, 12). In the first casing part (10) there are situated an inflow channel (14), an outflow channel (16), an annular valve face (20) and an annular channel (18) which surrounds the said face (20). A closing body (24) is pressed against the valve face (20) by a compression spring (26) and delimits, on its side facing away from the valve face, a pressure equalisation chamber (22), which is formed in the second casing part and is connected via a pressure equalisation channel (52) to the inflow channel (14) so as to permit the throughflow of fluids. A pilot valve (30, 32) controls a flow path (42) between the pressure equalisation chamber (22) and the outflow channel (16). In the pressure equalisation channel (52) there is arranged a nonreturn valve (54, 56) which closes the latter channel (52) off from the inflow channel (14) in the direction of flow from the pressure equalisation chamber (22). This makes the valve secure against back pressure.

A pilot controlled valve for tank systems for motor 
vehicles, comprising a valve body, in which an inlet duct (14), 

an outlet duct (16), an annular valve seat (20) and an annular 
duct (18) surrounding the same are formed, a valve closure 

member (24), which is urged by a compression spring (26) toward 
engagement with the valve seat (20) and on a side thereof 

turned away from the valve seat defines a pressure equalizing 
space (22) connected by at least one pressure equalizing duct 

(52) with the inlet duct (14) to provide a flow connection, and 
at least one pilot valve (30, 32), by which a flow path (42) 

between the pressure equalizing space (22) and the outlet duct 
(16) may be controlled, a check valve (54, 56) being arranged 

in the pressure equalizing duct (52) and closing the same in 
the flow direction from the pressure equalizing space (22) to 

the inlet duct (14), characterized by an excess pressure valve 
(66, 68) integrated in the valve body (10, 12) and opening a 

flow connection to the inlet duct (14) when at the outlet side, 
defined by the valve closure member (24), of the valve a 

pressure is present which exceeds the pressure on the inlet 
side by a predetermined amount. 
The valve as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the pressure equalizing duct (52) extends through the valve 

closure member (24).  
 
The valve as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the excess pressure valve (66, 68) is 

arranged in a relief duct (60) leading to the inlet duct (14) 
and branching from the flow path (42) which is under the 

control of the pilot valve (30, 32). 
The valve as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the check valve (54, 56) is 

constituted by an annular sealing seat (54) surrounding the 
aperture opening of the pressure equalizing duct (52) on the 

pressure equalizing space (22) side and by a valve ball (56) 
urged by a compression spring (58) into engagement with the 

sealing seat (54). 
The valve as claimed in any one of the claims 1 through 
3, characterized in that the check valve is constituted by an 

annular sealing seat surrounding the aperture opening of the 
pressure equalizing duct (52) on the pressure equalizing space 

(22) side and by a valve flap (53A, 53B) held elastically 
against the sealing seat. 
The valve as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized by a plurality of pressure equalizing 

ducts (52A, 52B), each having an associated check valve (53A, 
53B), extending through the valve closure member (24). 
The valve as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the valve closure member (24) is 

constituted by a valve plate. 
The valve as claimed in any one of the claims 1 through 
6, characterized in that the valve closure member (24) is 

constituted by a diaphragm (24B) held at an outer edge thereof 
in the valve body (10, 12) and having a rigid middle part 

(24A), against which the compression spring (26) bears. 
The valve as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized by two pilot valves (30, 32) controlling 

the flow connections (40, 46) of different inside diameter 
between the pressure equalizing space (22) and the outlet duct 

(16).  
 
The valve as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the valve body is constituted by 

two housing parts (10, 12), the first (10) of which is provided 
with the inlet duct (14), the outlet duct (16) and the annular 

duct (18), and the second (12) of which comprises the pressure 
equalizing chamber (22) and the flow path (42) controlled by 

the pilot valve (30, 32). 
The valve as claimed in claim 10, characterized in

valve (66, 68). 
The valve as claimed in claim 11, characterized in 
that the annular duct (18) is connected with the outlet duct

valve (30, 32) is at least nearly completely formed in the 

second housing part (12), and in that the relief duct (60)
