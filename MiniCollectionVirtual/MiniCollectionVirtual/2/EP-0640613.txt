<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to oligosialyl-1,2-dialkyl-Sn-glycerols 
and synthetic intermediates for their preparation. More 
specifically, it relates to α2 → 8 oligosialyl-1,2-dialkyl-Sn-glycerols 
and synthetic intermediates for their preparation, and 
processes for preparing said compounds. Various sugar chain structures containing a sialic acid have 
been found in gangliosides and glycoproteins. For example, some 
sialic acid-containing polysaccharides have been found in capsular 
components of certain pathogenic bacteria. The capsular 
polysaccharide isolated from Neisseria meningitidis Serotype C is 
composed of a single polymer consisting of N-acetylneuraminic acids 
connected with α2 → 9 bond. ¹³C NMR spectroscopic study has 
revealed that the polymer(at 8- or 9-position) has partially O-acetylated 
structures (A.K. Bhattachariee, H.J. Jennings, C.P. 
Kenny, A. Martin, I.C.P. Smith, J. Biol. Chem., 250, 1926-1932, 
1975). In addition, it has been reported that the capsular 
polysaccharide isolated from Escherichia coli Bos 12 is also a 
hetero-polymer having both α2 → 9 and α2 → 8 bonding structures  
 
and that the capsular polysaccharide isolated from Escherichia coli 
K1 is a homo-polymer having α2 → 8 bonding structures (W. Egan, 
T.Y. Lui, D. Dorow, J.S. Cohem, J.D. Robine, E.C. Gotschlich, 
J.B.Robins, Biochemistry, 16, 3687-3692, 1977). Some of 
polysaccharides produced by bacteria have recently been found to 
have pharmacological activities such as immuno-stimulating activity 
and antitumor activity (E.C. Gotschlich, B.A. Franser, O.N. 
Shimura, J.B. Robbins, T.Y. Lui, J.Biol, Chem., 256, 8915-8921, 
1981). They are substances of interest from their pharmacological 
activities. However, any process for chemical preparation of oligosialic 
acids as well as aforementioned sialic acid-containing 
polysaccharides has not been reported to date. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide 
oligosialyl-1,2-dialkyl-Sn-glycerols which are derivatives of 
oligosialic acids and synthetic intermediates for their preparation. 
In addition, the present invention provides a process for 
preparing said oligosialyl-1,2-dialkyl-Sn-glycerols. The inventors of the present invention succeeded in preparing 
oligosialyl-1,2-dialkyl-Sn-glycerols by using an oligosialic acid as 
a starting material which was stereo-selectively prepared by the 
condensation between a sugar-donative sialic acid introduced by a 
facilitative group at the 3-position and a suitably protected sugar-accepting 
sialic
