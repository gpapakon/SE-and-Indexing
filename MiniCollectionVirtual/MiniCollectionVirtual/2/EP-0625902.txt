 METHOD OF TREATINGABNORMAL TISSUE PROLIFERATION BYADMINISTERING AN ANGIOTENSIN II ANTAGONISTCross-ReferenceTo Related ApplicationThis application is a continuation-in-part ofU.S. application Serial No. 07/837,446 filed February 14, 1992.Technical FieldThe present invention relates to a method of treating a patient having restenosis or atherosclerosis, both of which involve the occlusion of arterial vessels by vascular smooth muscle cells, said treatment being achieved by administering pharmaceutically useful compounds which are angiotensin II receptor antagonists. The invention is also with reducing neointimal hyperpla¬ sia of vascular smooth muscle.Backgro nd ArtAtherosclerotic arterial occlusive disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States (W.P. Castelli, AM J. MED., 76:4-12 (1984)). One important strategy in the treatment of this disorder is the use of various revascularization techniques such as saphenous vein bypass grafting, endarterectomy, and transluminal coronary angioplasty. Unfortunately, the overall success of these revascularization procedures is limited by restenosis due to neointimal hyperplasia. The magnitude of this problem in clinical medicine is 

increasing with the rising rate of cardiovascular surgery and interventional therapy.Several factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of restenosis, including the hormone angiotensin II (Ang II) , which is an integral part of the renin-angiotensin system and is a regulator of vascular tone and structure. Ang II is a potent vaso¬ constrictor which plays a central role in hypertension, congestive heart failure, and vascular diseases. In vivo, Ang II is implicated in the vascular hypertrophy of hypertension since angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can prevent or attenuate medial hyper¬ trophy in many models of hypertension (G.K. Owens, CIRC. RES., 56:525-536 (1985)). Recently it has been found that inhibitors of ACE will reduce or attenuate the development of intimal hyperplasia in the rat in re¬ sponse to injury (J.S. Powell et al., SCIENCE, 245:186- 188 (1989)). These growth inhibitory effects are independent of the hemodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors since treatment with other blood pressure lowering drugs does not inhibit this growth (J.S. Powell et al., J. CARD. PHARMACOL. 16 (Suppl. 4):S42-S49 (1990)). Similar studies have shown that ACE inhibitors prevent vascular growth in response to injury in guinea pigs (J.P. Clozel et al., "Inhibition Of Converting Enzyme and Neointima Formation
