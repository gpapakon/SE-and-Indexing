<ABSTRACT>
A method for recovering carboxylic acids from a dilute aqueous 
solution thereof having a concentration below about ten percent (10%) by 

weight, which includes passing the dilute acid solution through a reverse 

osmosis separator, thereby producing a permeate substantially free of acid 
and a retentate having an acid concentration above about ten percent (10%) 

by weight. The retentate is contacted with a liquid extractant for acids to 
produce an acid-rich extractate and an acid-free raffinate. The acid is then 

recovered from the acid-rich extractate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus
for recovering carboxylic acids from dilute solutions
thereof by the use of reverse osmosis membrane systems
in combination with other acid recovery techniques.Many industrially important processes result in
the production of streams of carboxylic acids in
dilute concentrations. Economic considerations and
environmental concerns lead to the desirability of
recovering carboxylic acids from such streams for
reuse, for sale, or for disposal in the most economic
manner.Experience has shown that carboxylic acids in
dilute concentrations, i.e. below about fifteen
percent (15%) by weight, in aqueous streams, are most
economically removed and recovered through the use of
a liquid-liquid extraction process employing a high-boiling
solvent. When the carboxylic acids make up
less than about three percent (3%) by weight of the
stream to be treated, it becomes difficult to recover
the acids economically by such a liquid-liquid
extraction process, although environmental
considerations often make it necessary to treat such
streams nonetheless.US Patent No 2 953 502 describes the use of a
non-porous membrane to produce mixtures having 
differing portions of the components from the starting
mixture. The mixtures can then be distilled.US Patent No 3 182 043 describes a membrane which
is resistant to acids and so can be used to separate
water from aqueous solutions of monocarboxylic acids.Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol 7. No. 225(C-189)
137060 dated 1983 describes a reverse osmosis membrane
for use in concentrating an organic acid. It does not,
however, teach any after-treatment of the resulting
concentrated acid.In accordance with the present invention, there
is provided a method of recovering carboxylic acids
from a dilute solution thereof, comprising passing the
dilute solution through a reverse osmosis membrane
separator to produce an aqueous permeate substantially
free of acid and aqueous retentate having an acid
concentration more concentrated than the initial
concentration of the dilute acid solution,
characterised in that the carboxylic acids have from
1 to 7 carbon atoms or are mixtures thereof, the
dilute acid solution has an acid concentration below
about 10% by weight, and the aqueous retentate has an
acid concentration above about 10% weight, and in that
the retentate is treated in an acid separation step by
contacting the retentate with a liquid extractant for
the acids thereby to produce an acid rich extractate
and a substantially acid free raffinate, and

<CLAIMS>
A method of recovering carboxylic acids from a dilute
solution thereof, comprising passing the dilute solution

through a reverse osmosis membrane separator (26) to
produce an aqueous permeate (30) substantially free of acid

and an aqueous retentate (28) having an acid concentration
more concentrated than the initial concentration of the

dilute acid solution, characterised in that the carboxylic
acids have from 1 to 7 carbon atoms or are mixtures

thereof, the dilute acid solution has an acid concentration
below about 10% by weight, and the aqueous retentate (28)

has an acid concentration above about 10% by weight, and in
that the retentate (28) is treated in an acid separation

step (32) by contacting the retentate (28) with a liquid
extractant for the acids thereby to produce an acid rich

extractate (36) and a substantially acid free raffinate
(34), and recovering acid from the acid rich extractate

(36).
A method as claimed in Claim 1 in which the carboxylic
acids have from two to four carbon atoms or are mixtures

thereof.
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 in which
acid is recovered from the acid-rich extractate (36) by

distillation.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim in which
the dilute aqueous solution of carboxylic acids contains

one or more impurities consisting of aromatic carboxylic
acids, metallic ions, free metal particles, organic or

inorganic salts, straight chain carboxylic acids having
more than five carbon atoms or sugars and in which these

impurities are removed from the dilute aqueous solution
prior to its passage through the reverse osmosis separator

(26). 
A method in accordance with Claim 4 in which the
impurities are removed from the dilute aqueous carboxylic

acid solution by filtration, microfiltration,
ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, or a combination of two or

more of these processes.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim in which
the reverse osmosis separator employs a semi-permeable

membrane formed from polysulphone, polyether sulphone,
cellulose acetate, polyamide, cellulose esters, cellulose

triacetate, polyether urea, polyvinyl alcohol,
polypiperiazamide, polyfuren, cellulose acetate butyrate,

aromatic polyamide, polyethyleneimine, or thin film
composites of any of the above.
