<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein is a transmission power level monitoring 
apparatus suitable for use in a digital communication system 

using a TDMA method. The transmission power level monitoring 
apparatus detects start and end times of a transmission slot in 

each TDMA frame. An A/D converter (24) is triggered at the start 
and end times so as to convert transmission power into a digital 

signal. Then it is decided whether or not the transmission power 
is in an improper state during a transmission slot and a 

nontransmission slot in each TDMA frame. If the answer is yes, 
then suitable measures are taken, such as a display of a message 

indicative of its improper state on a display device (25), the 
transmission of data indicative of its improper state to another 

system (30) and/or turning off (26) a power source for a power 
amplifier of a transmitter (23).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mobile TDMA communication 
system for transmitting data therefrom and receiving the same 
therein in accordance with a TDMA method, and particularly to an 
RF power level monitoring apparatus suitable for use in a mobile 
TDMA communication system. FIG. 6 is a view showing the structure of an RF power level 
monitoring apparatus which has conventionally been employed in a 
mobile analog communication system. In FIG. 6, reference numeral 
121 indicates a CPU of the mobile analog communication system 
and reference numeral 123 indicates a transmitter including a 
transmission and reception antenna (not shown). Further, 
reference numeral 124 indicates an A/D converter for converting 
an RF power level of a transmission signal frequency-converted 
into an RF band and whose power has been amplified, into a 
digital value. In order to measure an analog level of a signal sent from the 
transmitter 123, the CPU 121 outputs a triggering signal to the 
A/D converter 124. The A/D converter 124 converts the analog  
 
level of the signal sent from the transmitter 123 into digital 
data in response to the triggering signal supplied from the CPU 
121. When the conversion of the analog level into the digital 
data has been completed, the A/D converter 124 delivers a 
conversion end signal indicative of its completion to the CPU 
121. When the CPU 121 recognizes the delivery of the conversion 
end signal from the A/D converter 124, the CPU 121 reads the 
digital data converted by the A/D converter 24 and makes a 
decision as to whether or not the analog level of the signal 
transmitted from the transmitter 123 is normal. If it is decided that the analog level of the signal is in an 
improper state, then the CPU 121 displays the contents of its 
improper state on a display device of the mobile analog 
communication system. Sequentially the CPU 121 turns off an RF 
power amplifier or sends a signal indicative of its improper 
state to a system connected to the mobile analog communication 
system. When the conventional power level monitoring apparatus 
having the above-described construction is applied to an analog 
communication system whose output to be transmitted is constant, 
the transmission power can be monitored accurately. However, a 
transmission signal is burst-transmitted during a few 
milliseconds in a TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) system. 
Therefore, the power to be transmitted cannot be measured with 
accuracy when the aforementioned power monitoring apparatus is 
u
