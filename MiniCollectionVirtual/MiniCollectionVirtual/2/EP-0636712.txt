<ABSTRACT>
The cleaning process is usable especially for washing the outer faces of steam generator tubes. The surface metal oxides are removed by a complexing operation (which may be preceded by a reduction) and then dissolving of the siliceous compounds is effected by a reaction with electrophilic compounds in aqueous insertion medium or a reaction with alcohols or amines in aqueous condensation medium, the reaction being intended to weaken the bonds, in a medium ensuring the complexing of Si(OH)4.

<CLAIMS>
Process for chemical cleaning of metal components
carrying an iron oxide deposit upon a layer of

compounds having a high silica content, including: eliminating
the superficial metal oxides by complexation,

possibly after reduction, then solubilizing the silica
compounds by a reaction in aqueous medium for increasing

the coordination number of silica with electrophilic
compounds belonging to the group comprising the conjugated

unsaturated systems and the unsaturated N-oxide compounds
or by a reaction in aqueous medium for condensation with

alcohols or amines, for weakening the bonds, in a medium
which causes complexation of Si(OH)
4
.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in
that the unsaturated systems comprise substituted phenyl

groups.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in
that the unsaturated compounds comprise a plurality of

benzene rings.
Process according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized
in that the silica compounds are further maintained

in solution by adding compounds complexing Si(OH)
4
 to the
medium.
Process according to claim 4, characterized in
that said compounds are selected among molybdates.
Process according to claim 5, characterized in
that said compounds are ammonium molybdates.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in
that the unsaturated conjugated systems contain groups

belonging to organic compounds having at least one alcohol
function, to amines or to soluble salts thereof.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in
that an aromatic amine or a salt of a tertiary amine is

used. 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in
that the substituted phenyl groups belong to monophenyl,

diphenyl and triphenyl.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in
that condensation is carried out by phenol, pyrocatechol

or pyrogallol.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized by a final step of passivation by

oxidation and dehydroxylation.
