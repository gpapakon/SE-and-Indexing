<DESCRIPTION>
 SUPPORT ATTACHMENT FOR HOLDING BOTTLES WITHIN A BLOCKTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to a support attachment for use with a holding unit having two adjacent cavities for holding bottles and a method of using the support attachment. More particularly, the present invention relates to a durable support attachment that allows for manufacturing variabilities and firmly holds a wider number of manufactured bottles while the holding unit is moving.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTypically, in diagnostic investigation of a plurality of fluid samples, racks or bottle blocks are used to carry and hold several containers or bottles of samples! This is done not only for ease of movement of a plurality of containers as a single unit, but also for a transfer vehicle to carry the sample containing bottles through a diagnostic or analytic instrument.These bottle holding units usually are rectangular in shape and have one or more cavities defining chambers in which bottles or containers of media, such as blood samples are carried. Glass containers or bottles are conventionally used for holding such samples.Because the manufacturing tolerances of the glass bottles are larger than the tolerances allowed between an inserted bottle and the chamber, the chambers are manufac¬ tured with a built-in wiggle problem. Resilient packing material has been used so that the entire range of manufac¬ tured containers fit snugly within the chambers. For example, the interior of the chambers are lined with packing material, such as felt which resiliently presses against the side walls of a container inserted within the chamber. Such a device is described in co-pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/351,476. 

 However, the use of resilient packing material, as described above, provides less than optimum support for bottles placed in a chamber. First, the initially obtained snug fit is not long lasting as the packing material itself, quickly wears away becoming thinner due to the inserting and removal of bottles. Further, the adhesive used to secure strips of the packing material to the interior of the chambers looses its stickiness and as a result, the packing material strips are pushed into the bottom well of the chambers. Since the bottles must remain still within the chambers to obtain accurate diagnostic or analytic readings of the samples, other materials and techniques have been tried to overcome these problems.Instead of lining the interior of chambers, circular washers were installed on the top surface of each

 AMENDED CLAIMS
[received by the International Bureau on 28 October 1991 (28.10.91) ; original claims 1-4, 6-8 amended ; other claims unchanged (2 pages)]
1. A support attachment for use with a holding unit having at least two adjacent cavities with longitudinal axes for holding bottles, said support attachment having a central axis and comprising: a plate adapted to be fitted to the holding unit; and a pair of elongated leg means in symmetrical spaced relationship with respect to said central axis for supporting bottles held in two adjacent cavities in the holding unit, each leg means extending, in the same direc¬ tion, from opposite ends of the plate and having first and second ends, said first ends joined at substantially right angles to the plate and said second ends normally biased toward one another so that when the plate is fitted onto the holding unit, one of said leg means extends longitudinally into one of the adjacent cavities while the other said leg means extends into another adjacent cavity; each said leg means having a plurality of leg sections connected to one another at varying angles between said first and second ends, said leg sections being constructed and arranged so as to create the bias between the second ends of each leg means and to form at least two pressure points on each of said leg means which extend radially inwardly toward the center of a respective adjacent cavity when the plate is fitted onto the holding unit, said at least two pressure points contacting and applying a force against a bottle inserted in the respective adjacent cavity thereby holding the bottle within the cavity.
2. The support attachment as defined in claim 1, wherein the plate comprises means for fastening the support attachment to said holding unit. 


 3. The support attachment as defined in claim 1 wherein said leg means are constructed from a thin, flat resilient material.
4. The support attachment as defined in claim 3 wherein said material is metal.
6. The support attachment as defined in claim 1, wherein said at least two points comprises first and second pressure points and said plurality of leg sections includes a first leg section, corresponding to said first end, substantially perpendicular to the plate and parallel to the central axis; a second leg section extending from said first leg section at an angle away from said central axis; a third leg section extending from said second leg section at an angle toward said central axis, said second and third leg sections being connected at the first pressure point; a fourth leg section extending from said third leg section substantially parallel to the central axis; and a fifth leg section extending from the fourth leg section at an angle toward the central axis and ending at the second end so that the fifth sections of each leg means normally are biased toward one another, said fourth and fifth leg sections being connected at the second pressure point.
7. The support attachment as defined in claim 1, wherein said fastening means is a fastener receiving opening which receives a fastener for attaching the plate to a block.
8. The support attachment as defined in claim 1, wherein said plate and leg means are of unitary construction.
