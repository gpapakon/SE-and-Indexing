<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a tubular device for 
insertion in the urethra after transurethral laser 

irradiation procedure for temporarily keeping the 
urethra patent, said device consisting of a material 

which is biodegradable and/or dissolving in the organism. 
The device is substantially shorter than the 

urethra so that it can be totally disposed in the 
urethra.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a tubular device 
intended to be installed in the urethra after 
transurethral laser irradiation intervention for the 
purpose of temporarily keeping the urethra patent. The 
invention also concerns use of said device in a 
transurethral laser irradiation therapy procedure. Various urological disorders are highly common. 
In men, urological problems are most often connected 
with the prostatic gland. Prostatic complaints are usually a problem of 
aging men. A highly typical benign prostatic disorder, 
benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is found in more 
than 50% of men over 50. BPH causes various problems 
interfering with the normal function of the urinary 
passages. In the U.S.A., for instance, about 400,000 
BPH cases requiring therapy are detected annually. 
Therapy is implemented e.g. by reducing the prostate 
using transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). 
Laser irradiation is a commonly accepted therapeutic 
procedure serving as one of the forms of therapy applied 
in various urological diseases and conditions. 
Lately, transurethral laser irradiation has also been 
adopted as an alternative therapy in cases of BPH e.g. 
to replace the surgical TURP method. Laser irradiation 
has also been applied in combination with said surgical 
procedure. In the transurethral laser therapy procedure 
for BPH the hyperplastic prostate tissue is reduced by 
destroying prostate tissue surrounding the urethra 
with the aid of heat generated at laser irradiation. 
The destroyed necrotic tissue becomes detached and 
departs from around the urethra within about 3-4 
weeks. The advantage of the transurethral laser irradiation  
 
procedure e.g. over the surgical TURP method 
is that in the laser irradiation procedure haemorrhage 
at the object thus treated is significantly less, and 
the procedure is swift in implementation, whereby anaesthetizing 
the patient is not indispensably necessary 
and the therapy can be policlinically undertaken, 
implying lowered treatment costs in view of the patient 
as well as the unit giving the therapy. Furthermore, 
the risk of complications following on laser 
irradiation is markedly lower than that after surgical 
intervention. Said laser irradiation procedure is however 
embarrassed by the problem that the living tissue surrounding 
the prostatic tissue which has been destroyed 
by irradiation reacts owing to the thermal effect that 
has been produced, whereby fluid accumulates in the 
tissue and the tissue swells powerfully. The strongly

urethra so that it can be totally disposed in the 
urethra. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the cross section of the device has substantially 

circular or elliptic shape. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized 
in that in the wall of the tubular device apertures 

have been provided. 
Device according to any one of claims 1-3, 
characterized in that the device substantially retains 

its shape in the urethra for at least about 1-3 
weeks, e.g. at least one month, advantageously 3-12

polyhydroxypropionate, mixtures and copolymers of said 
polymers, chitin polymers, polyester amides or glycolesters. 
Device according to any one of claims 1-5, 
characterized in that the transurethral laser irradiation 

procedure is a transurethral prostate laser 
irradiation procedure. 
A therapeutic procedure, the patient 
being subjected to transurethral laser irradiation, 

whereafter in the urethra is inserted a tubular device 
 

for temporarily keeping the urethra patent, characterized 
in that in the urethra is inserted a device consisting 

of material which is biodegraded and/or dissolved 
in the organism, and which is substantially 

shorter than the urethra so that it becomes disposed 
totally within the urethra. 
Procedure according to claim 7, characterized 
in that the patient is subjected to transurethral 

laser irradiation of the prostate and in the 
urethra is inserted a tubular device which in the 

urethra substantially retains its shape at least about 
a few days to three weeks, e.g. at least one month, 

advantageously 3-12 months.

claim 1 after a transurethral laser irradiation procedure 

for temporarily keeping the urethra patent. 
Use of a tubular device according to 
claim 9 in connection with transurethral prostate 

laser irradiation.
