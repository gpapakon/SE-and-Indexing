<ABSTRACT>
A roller pump for medical technology, especially for conveying blood in extracorporeal circulations. The roller pump comprises a stator (1) with a cylindrical cavity (2) whose wall is designed as a bearing wall (3) for a pump tubing (5) guided along the bearing wall around the mid-longitudinal axis of the cavity. In the pump stator, a pump rotor which is rotatable about its longitudinal centre line (4) is arranged, and this has rollers (8) which are rotatably mounted on roller supports (7) which can be rolled over the tubing with rotation of the rotor and compression of the tubing. The bearing wall (3) of the pump rotor has an opening (6) with an entry region (10) and an exit region (12) for the tubing (5). In these regions, this bearing wall recedes from the circular track of the pump rollers (8) in a curvature extending in the same direction as that track. The bearing wall (3) possesses a radius of curvature which increases continuously in the running direction of the pump rollers (8) in the entry region (10), and a radius of curvature which decreases continuously in the running direction of the rollers in the exit region (12).

Roller pump for use in medical technology, in
particular for conveying blood in extracorporeal

circuits, which roller pump has a stator with a
cylindrical hollow chamber whose wall is constructed as a

bearing wall (3) for a pump hose (5) led along this
bearing wall around the central longitudinal axis (4) of

the hollow chamber, in which pump stator (1) a pump
rotor (9) is arranged for rotation about the central

longitudinal axis of the pump stator (1), which pump
rotor (9) has rollers (8) rotatably mounted in roller

supports, which rollers, during rotation of the rotor,
can be rolled off the hose whilst at the same time

compressing the hose, wherein the bearing wall (3) of the
pump rotor has an opening with an in and outlet region

(10, 12) for the hose (5), in which regions this bearing
wall recedes from the circular running path of the pump

rollers in a curvature in the same direction to this
running path, characterised in that in the inlet region

(10) in the running direction of the pump rollers (8) the
bearing wall (3) has a steadily increasing radius of

curvature and in the outlet region (12) in the running
direction of the rollers it has a steadily decreasing

radius of curvature, these radii of curvature (C, D, E)
being larger than the radius of curvature in the region

between the inlet and outlet.
Roller pump according to claim 1, characterised in
that the centre points of the radii of curvature in the

inlet and outlet region (10, 12) of the bearing wall (3)
are in each case located on one curve which, starting

from the plane stretching from the longitudinal centre
plane (4) of the pump stator and the starting point of

the outlet region or the end point of the inlet region
(A, B) (when viewed in the direction of conveyance), is 

curved towards the outlet opening or inlet opening (6) of
the pump stator.
Roller pump according to claim 1, characterised in
that the bearing wall (3) extends in a circular shape

over an area of 180Â°.
Roller pump according to claim 1, characterised in
that the curvature developments of the region (10) and

the outlet region (12) can be mechanically adjusted.
Roller pump according to claim 4, characterised in
that the bearing wall (3) in the inlet and outlet region

(10, 12) in each case is formed of a plurality of
segments which, for the purpose of adjusting the

curvature development of the bearing wall, are radially
moveable.
Roller pump according to claim 1, characterised in
that the winding speed of the roller supports (7)

supporting the pump rollers (8) can be varied as a
function of the rollers' rotational position.
Roller pump according to claim 1, characterised in
that the pump rollers (8) can be mutually driven via a

drive connection (13, 14, 15).
