<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement which 
enables an optical fibre to be identified out of a set of 

fibres at an arbitrary location along the length of the 
fibre. The invention comprises a light-generating element 

at the first end of the fibre which injects light of 
known polarization At the other end of the fibre, the 

light is reflected back to the first end of the fibre. 
Along the fibre, a seeker element is placed which has a 

capability of influencing the fibre thereby altering the 
polarization of the light. At the first end of the fibre, 

a detecting element is also placed which detects the 
change in polarization of the reflected light thereby 

identifying the sought-after fibre (Figure 1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement
which makes it possible to be able to identify out of a
set of optical fibres a certain fibre at an arbitrary location
along the length of the fibre.The arrangement operates free from interference
without producing mechanical damage to the fibre by
utilizing an effect on the fibre which produces a change
in polarization which is detected. The fibre is affected
electrically or magnetically or preferably mechanically.It is already known that an influence on a fibre
causes a change in polarization in the transmitted light.
Above all, mechanical influencing of a fibre has been
used for sensing different quantities.EP-0,151,015 describes an apparatus by means of
which the mechanical stress in an optical fibre during
its manufacture can be sensed with the aid of a detected
change in polarization.EP-0,120,999 describes a fibre optical sensor
which, with the aid of a detected change in polarization,
can sense force and pressure. Besides this, the sensor
can also be used in monitoring and protection arrangements,
for example line monitoring in tennis courts.EP-0,291,962 relates to a method for measuring
polarization and birefringence in optical single-mode
fibres.JP 59-27232 shows an optical pressure sensor
which provides for simple sensing of pressure changes
with the aid of an optical fibre.EP-0,249,923 describes a method and a device for
measuring polarization beat length in strongly doubly
refracted optical single-mode fibres.EP-0,190,922 describes a device and a method for 
determining the orientation of the birefractive axes in
an optical fibre.FR 2,547,049 describes a polarimeter system for
remote parameter measuring which uses an analyser for
determining the phase shift between channels with fixed
and variable polarization.EP-0,143,583 describes a fibre optical mode
coupling device comprising a pressure element.EP-A-0 390 341, which is considered the most relevant
priort art, relates to a method and apparatus for identifying
an optical transmission medium in which a light-generating
element injects light of known polarization into a
first end of a fibre, which light is reflected by the other
end of the fibre back towards the fist end, a seeker element
is arranged at an arbitrary point along the fibre in order
to influence the polarization of the light, and a detecting
element is arranged at the first end of the fibre in order
to detect a change in polarization which is caused by the
seeker element, and thereby verify the identity of the
fibre.EP-A-0 536 002

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for identifying an optical fibre out of
a set of fibres at an arbitrary location along the length of

the fibre, comprising

a light-generating element which injects light of known
polarization into a first end of the fibre, which light is

reflected by the other end of the fibre back towards the
first end,
a seeker element arranged at an arbitrary point along
the fibre in order to influence the polarization of the

light by mechanically pressing on the fibre,
a detecting element arranged at the first end of the
fibre in order to detect a change in polarization which is

caused by the seeker element, and thereby verify the identity
of the fibre, 
characterized
 in that the seeker element
comprises a pressure device (20) with a rounded surface

which rests against a ribbon fibre cable (10) and has the
capability of swinging from side to side at the same time as

it presses against the cable (10) so that the pressure
against an individual fibre (A, B, C, D) will be modulated

by the pressure device (20) changing position.
Arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in
that the seeker element is arranged to modulate the pressure

on the fibre sinusoidally.
Arrangement according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in
that the light-generating element is arranged to rotate its

direction of polarization alternately between two different
directions.
Arrangement according to any of the preceding
claims, 
characterized
 in that the detecting element comprises
functions for communication.
