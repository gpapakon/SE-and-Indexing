<ABSTRACT>
Mold growth on a sample is measured by placing the sample in a container that maintains a controlled constant environment that will support rapid mold growth; maintaining the sample at a constant moisture content, initiating mold growth on the sample; and measuring the change of O2 and/or CO2 in the container as a measure of the change of mold growth on the sample.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for measuring mold
growth.Mycotoxin contamination of foodstuffs is a common problem impacting the
grain, feed, and animal industries. It is known that at least 300 different mycotoxins
can contaminate cereal grains and oil seeds. Contamination of these foodstuffs can
result in destruction of large quantities of grain. Additionally, since these
commodities typically represent a major component of animal feeds, the threat to
animal health from mycotoxin contamination is significant. Due to an increased
awareness of the potential health hazards associated with mycotoxins, and recent
advances in the testing of feedstuffs for the presence of mycotoxins, contamination
of grains and feed by these compounds is considered one of the major problems
facing the grain and animal industries. Mycotoxin contamination of foodstuffs is the
result of uncontrolled growth of certain toxigenic molds. Mycotoxins are highly
toxic metabolic by-products, released into the immediate environment as these molds
grow. As time proceeds, the molds responsible for the production of the mycotoxins
may become non-viable. However, in most cases the mycotoxins remain due to their
high chemical stability.A logical approach to minimizing mycotoxin contamination in foodstuffs is
to minimize mold growth. Numerous approaches have been employed by the grain,
feed, and animal industries to minimize mold growth in foodstuffs: (1) Proper use of
insecticides, fertilizers, and irrigation techniques reduces greatly the probability of
mold growth and mycotoxin formation in pre-harvest grain. (2) Early harvest of
grain usually leads to minimal mold growth and minimal mycotoxin contamination
because mold growth occurs in pre-harvest grains near the end of the growing cycle
of the grain. (3) Immediate, rapid and complete drying of harvested grains retards
the growth of molds in post-harvest grain. However, the drying procedures must be
initiated as soon after harvest as possible, and the final moisture of the grain must be
low enough to prevent mold growth. (4) Storage of grain and manufactured feeds in
storage facilities that are dry, water-tight, and free of moldy and caked material 
assists in the prevention of mold growth and mycotoxin contamination in grain or
feed stored in these storage containers. (5) Rapid use of manufactured feeds
decreases the chance of mold growth during the period between feed manufacture
and feed consumption. (6) The use of chemical preservatives minimizes mold
growth in grain

<CLAIMS>
A method of determining mould growth on poultry
feed comprising:


(a) placing into a closed container a sample of
said feed containing mould spore said sample having a

predetermined fixed moisture content that will support rapid
growth of mould on said sample;
(b) maintaining the environment in said
container dark and at substantially constant temperature and

relative humidity that will support rapid mould growth;
(c) avoiding condensation of water vapour in
said container that changes the moisture content of any part

of said sample;
(d) avoiding in said container significant
change in oxygen and/or carbon dioxide concentration that

would impede the mould growth;
(e) periodically withdrawing air from said
container and determining the concentration of at least one

metabolic gas in said air;
(f) determining from successive determinations
the concentration change of said metabolic gas in said

container; and
(g) correlating the concentration change of said
metabolic gas with the rate of mould growth.
The method of Claim 1 wherein said sample is
inoculated with at least one mould before placing said

sample in said chamber.
The method of either of Claims 1 and 2 wherein
said sample is treated with a fungal retardant before

placing said sample in said chamber.
The method of Claim 1 wherein said sample is
sterilized, inoculated with at least one mould, and treated

with a fungal retardant before placing said sample in said
chamber.
The method of either of Claims 3 and 4 wherein
said fungal retardant is selected from natamycin, nystatin,

propionic acid and its fungicidal salts.
The method of any one of the preceding claims 
wherein said poultry feed is pulverized, preferably ground

to pass through a sieve with a pore size of 1.0mm.
The method of Claim 6 wherein said feed is
treated with natamycin before being placed in said chamber.
The method of any one of the preceding claims
wherein the atmosphere in the container is periodically

refreshed so that the concentrations of oxygen and
concentrations of carbon dioxide that would impede mould

growth are avoided.
