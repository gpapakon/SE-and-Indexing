<ABSTRACT>
Acoustic surveillance (by 12) of objects and human traffic (13,14) in a 
spatial zone of a financial transaction device (10) is used to detect movement within 

the zone. Several specific types of detected movement defined as abnormal trigger 
an alert to a remote monitoring station. The alerts are automatically prioritized using 

rule-based criteria. Enhanced surveillance of the alert site by audio links as well as 
site alert history information are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to automated remote site surveillance for ATM 
and other types of financial transaction devices; and also to machines, warehouses, 
shopping malls, parking lots, small businesses, residential properties and the like. In 
particular, the invention relates to the automated identification and reporting of 
activities at such a site which are or may be abnormal and hence indicative of 
possible endangering activity at the site. Currently, security surveillance of unguarded sites for burglary, 
vandalism or other unlawful activity, or for augmenting protection of guarded sites, 
usually involves taking video camera images of site activity and transmitting the 
images to a remote central monitoring point. Detection of an actionable incident or 
event at the site is left to a human observer, who periodically inspects an array of 
video displays of multiple sites. Because of fatigue and other factors, the chances of 
the observer falling to notice an incident are substantial. Further, automated reading 
of video imagery and signal patterns to provide discrimination among physical 
objects and their movement is difficult because of the complex and expensive signal 
processing required to accurately discriminate discrete object movement activity in a 
video pattern. Also, video bandwidth limitations of voice-grade circuits restrict the 
information that can be transmitted as video images. It has been realized that acoustic surveillance methods and apparatus are 
uniquely well-adapted to detect suspicious object presence and movement within a 
limited and discrete area such as an ATM or other financial transaction facility. The 
acoustic signal patterns emanating from objects and their movement may be spatially 
processed and the results analyzed in accordance with predetermined rules to 
distinguish suspicious from routine activity. The invention contemplates using an active acoustic system to generate 
a sound signal into a site such as an ATM location, for example. Various 
characteristics of the return waveform are measured. The measures include a 
comparison of the return waveform to a predetermined "template" of the site with no 
movement activity; and comparisons to the earlier return echoes. The measures then  
 
are evaluated according to the rules to determine whether a given return waveform is 
indicative of a suspicious event. The possible occurrence of a suspicious event is determined by 
acoustically detecting movement activity which is inconsistent with behavioral 
norms for
