<ABSTRACT>
A method is described for quantitative determination of oxidising and reducing substances, even in mixtures having substances that react in chemically similar fashion, in particular peroxyacetic acid (POA) mixed with further substances such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and/or acetic acid by means of potentiostatic amperometry which is known per se, in which the determination is carried out using a measurement-electrode voltage which, independently of the dominant reaction mechanism, lies below the diffusion limit current range between the open-circuit voltage and the point of inflection of the curve of current density against voltage. The POA determination takes place with a current density of 
<
 5%, preferably 
<
 1% of the limit current density.
