<ABSTRACT>
Articles such as molds for thermoplastics, having an insulating layer (22) preferably of resin deposited on the metal core materials, have a second layer of metal suspended in resin deposited on said insulating layer. The second layer may contain metal in platelet form (34) as the inner mold surface, or may contain metal in fiber, whisker or irregular form with a further metal coating (24) deposited thereon to provide resistance to abrasion. In the latter case, the adhesion of the further metal coating to the mold surface is higher than is the case if no metal-containing resin layer is present. A number of injection molding techniques utilizing the mold to produce finished parts in a variety of plastics materials are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 "Method and Apparatus for Molding Thermoplastic ATERIAL Employing MDlds with Improved Surface Properties"This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/936,464, filed August 28, 1992.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to molding of thermoplastic materials, and more particularly, to articles useful as molds for such materials and methods for molding employing such articles.Various types of molds have long been in use for preparing shaped articles from thermoplastic resins, in such operations as blow molding, compression molding, injection molding and injection compression molding. Molds for these purposes are typically manufactured from metal or a similar material having high thermal conductivity.Blow molding involves the extrusion of a molten tube of resin called a parison into a mold. The mold closes around the parison, pinching the bottom of the parison closed. A gas such as air is then introduced causing the tube to expand against the cool surfaces of the mold. When the parison comes into contact with the cool mold surface, the plastic at the surface quickly freezes. This results in surface imperfections such as die lines , fold lines, pores and voids. In compression molding, composite blanks of glass reinforced thermoplastic sheets are heated. The material is heated above its melting point or if an amorphous material at least substantially above its glass transition temperature. When the composite blanks are heated, they expand (loft) due to the recoil forces within the fibers. The hot blanks are then pressed between cool mold surfaces which are below the 

melting point or glass transition temperature. Contact with the cool mold surfaces results in frozen resin on the surface of the blank. This creates unfilled areas in the form of exposed fibers and surface porosity. The resin at the cold surface is frozen and does not flow. Thus, rough boundaries between the charged and newly formed areas are produced.Injection molding involves injecting molten thermoplastic resin into a mold apparatus. Molds for injection molding of thermoplastic resin are usually made from metal material such as iron, steel, stainless steel, aluminum alloy or brass. Such materials are advantageous in that they have high thermal conductivity and thus allow the melt of thermoplastic resin to cool rapidly and shorten the molding cycle time. Rapid cooling, the injected resin freezes instantaneously at the mold surface, resulting in a thin sold layer which restricts the flow of the molten
