<ABSTRACT>
To limit the water quantity absolutely necessary in an automatically controlled washing machine, according to the invention a sensor device 12 suitable for detecting a volume flow in the conveying direction of the pump 10 is arranged in the lye-circulation system 9 to 11. Furthermore, the control device of the washing machine is designed in such a way that, in the event of a signal from the sensor device which points to an absence of the volume flow, the valve can be controlled with the effect of supplying fresh water.

<CLAIMS>
Method for adapting a quantity of water, which is sufficient for washing or rinsing a
laundry batch and which is conducted into the treatment chamber, in an automatically

controlled washing machine with a heating device (11) for heating the water outside a
laundry treatment chamber (1), a solution circulating system (9 to 11), by means of which

solution is conducted out of the treatment chamber (1) at the base and is fed back to the
treatment chamber, above the laundry disposed in the treatment chamber, by way of a

circulation duct (9), at which is mounted a sensor device (12) which conducts an output
signal when solution flows through the solution circulating system, and at least one fresh

water feed duct which can be opened by means of a valve (7), which is controllable by a
control device (8), in the case of deficiency in the volume flow or closed in the case of

volume flow being present, 
characterised in that
 the solution in the circulation duct (9)
passes, starting from the pressure side of the pump (10), initially the heating device (11)

and then the sensor device (12) and that the sensor device (12) detects the volume flow
present within the circulation duct (9).

and then the sensor device (12) and the sensor device (12) detects the volume flow
present within the circulation duct (9) and that the heating device (11) is directly connected

with the pressure side of the pump (10) and the sensor device (12) is coupled into a
section of the circulation duct (9) which lies between the heating device (11) and the feed

(13) of the circulation duct (9) to the treatment chamber (1) and that the sensor device (12)
is equipped for direct detection of a volume flow. 
Washing machine according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the sensor device (12)
is a paddle switch with a vane directed against a notional flow in the circulation duct (9).
