<ABSTRACT>
An integrated device with electrically programmable and erasable memory 
cells, including one time programmable (OTP) read-only memory cells. To a 

matrix of user memory cells is added at least one row of OTP cells sharing 
the column selection lines (D1,D2,...) with the other cells. 
Similarly to the other cells, these have a selection terminal connected to 
a row selection line (OTP1,...). 
The source terminals of such OTP cells in the row are connected to the device 
ground (GND) through a common selection transistor (M1) which is driven from 

the same row selection line (OTP1,...).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrically programmable non-volatile
storage cell devices comprising, in particular,
non-erasable only time programmable (OTP) memory cells in
addition to electrically erasable read/write memory cells.Non-volatile storage devices (EEPROMs, EPROMs and
FLASHEEPROMs) may be written with information in storage areas
unaccessible by the device user.Such information is normally written in during the device
testing procedure by the manufacturer, and concerns the
history of individual devices.It may include, for example, operation speed class, any
redundancy used, the manufacturing date and batch, and the
like items of information.With non-volatile storage devices comprising memory cells
set up into a matrix type of architecture, wherein rows and
columns of cells are to be found together with lines to
interconnect cells in one row and cells in one column, it
may be convenient to add, to rows driven by the row
decoding facility which permits the user memory matrix to
be accessed, a few rows of OTP cells in the matrix.These rows utilize the same circuitry as the user memory
matrix for read and write operations and are enabled by
appropriate signals through the row decoding facility
itself.This kind of circuit architecture is conceptually simple
and effective, but may create some even serious reliability
problems with electrically erasable non-volatile storage
cell devices, in particular with FLASHEEPROMs. The possibility to erase electrically information written
in memory cells allows thousands of write/erase cycles to
be carried out, and accordingly, all the circuit elements
in such devices, and the memory cells especially, are
highly stressed and may develop malfunctions.In fact, where the erasing is performed electrically by
acting on the source of the memory cell field-effect
transistor with the gate clamped to a ground potential of
the device, while the drain potential is allowed to float
and the source potential is brought up to a value relative
to ground which can generate the required electric field to
produce a tunneling effect in the source areas, the
selection of the potential reference to which the sources
of the OTP cells should be connected becomes a critical
one.It is impossible to leave the source side of the OTP cells
connected to that of the user memory cells, constituting
the matrix virtual ground, because the erase operation
would result in the OTP cells being also erased.Nor is the expedient satisfactory of connecting the source
side of the OTP cells to the real
