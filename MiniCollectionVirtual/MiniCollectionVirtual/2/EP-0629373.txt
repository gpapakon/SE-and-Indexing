<ABSTRACT>
A polishing machine is intended to carry out the 
polishing of marginal areas of a floor, close to the walls, 

where conventional machines have difficulty to reach 
those areas, as well as the plinth, which cannot be 

reached by conventional machines. The disclosed machine 
comprises a rolling platform (1) within is mounted 

on a frame (5) including the motor unit of the machine, 
consisting of a motor (6) which, through a set of gears (8 

and 10), transmits the motion to a shaft (11) substantially 
lowered and connected to the polishing head (12) so 

that the tool associated to said head (12) is capable of 
contacting axially the plinth and radially the floor, the 

driving shaft (11) being also displaceable transversally 
to the machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polishing machine that 
is especially designed to polish floors, and in particular to 
polish the edges or marginal areas thereof, which machine can 
also be used for polishing or cleaning skirting boards and in any 
other like operation whatsoever. Machines that are normally used for polishing floors are 
known to have a vertical output shaft ending in an abrasive 
element or polishing element as such acting upon the horizontal 
plane, that is the floor, with a turning movement. This type of machines, albeit duly capable of executing 
their polishing function on most of the floor surface are 
primarily problematic in that they are unable to adequately reach 
the edges thereof, viz. the areas closest to the walls, which 
means that such marginal areas are left with a sharp and 
considerable unevenness that is on the one hand unsightly and on 
the other impairs the placement of certain furniture, for 
instance bookshelves or other elements fitted to the walls. Conventional polishing machines are moreover only capable 
of working on the floor and may not be used for cleaning skirting 
boards as well. The polishing machine subject of the invention is designed 
to be a complement to any conventional floor polishing machine, 
such that once the latter has completed its task the edges of the  
 
floor may be suitably levelled in order to achieve an optimal 
surface homogenisation, and at the same time or complementarily 
clean the skirting boards. More specifically and in order to achieve the above the 
polishing machine subject hereof comprises a small rolling 
platform having arms with a double bend for the establishment of 
wheels in order for the platform as such to be positioned as 
closely as possible to the floor, which platform supports a frame 
holding a driving element through the respective support, which 
drive shall by means of an adequate transmission provide a 
horizontal shaft relatively close to the rolling platform with 
movement, which shaft has its free end outside the frame fitted 
with a polishing head capable of working radially on the floor 
edges, causing the same to have a perfect finish, and of working 
axially or frontally on the skirting boards, to clean the same. In accordance with another characteristic of the invention 
the said support for the operative elements is associated to the 
frame through height adjustment spindles that allow the position 
of the operative group and in particular the distance of the 
polishing shaft from the floor to
