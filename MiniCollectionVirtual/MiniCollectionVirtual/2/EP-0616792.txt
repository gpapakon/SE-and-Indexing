<ABSTRACT>
The pressure and flow measuring device of a lung function control unit for the oscillometric determination of the human airway resistance is dynamically calibrated using a standard impedance whose shape and structure causes it to act independently of the flow and essentially purely resistively. The standard impedance (Fig. 1) comprises a starting flow path (2) which widens parabolically or in trumpet shape from a cylindrical connecting tube piece (1) to a screen resistance (3) located at its end. The screen resistance is exchangeable and is available with resistance values which cover the relevant part of the physiological spectrum of the human airway impedance.

Use of a reference impedance for dynamic calibration of the
pressure and flow-measuring equipment of a lung-testing device

for oscillometric measurement of human respiratory impedance
and/or for correcting the measurement results obtained with the

device,

the reference impedance comprising a resistive resistance element
(3) with an oncoming-flow surface extending transversely to

the direction of flow, particularly a circular screen resistor,
and

a pipe (1) connected to the resistance element (3) via a flow-starting
section (2), for connection to the measuring equipment

(10),

and the surface (4) of the resistance element (3) opposite to the
flow-starting section being open to atmosphere,

characterized by using a reference inpedance in which the oncoming-flow
surface area of the resistive resistance element (3)

is considerably greater than the cross-sectional area of the pipe
(1) at the place where it is connected to the measuring equipment

(10), and the starting section (2) widens up continuously to the
periphery of the oncoming-flow surface.
Use of a reference impedance according to claim 1,
characterized in that the starting section (2) widens in parabolic

or trumpet shape from a cylindrical or conical pipe (1)
to the periphery of the oncoming-flow surface of the resistance

element (3).
Use of a reference impedance according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the diameter of the oncoming-flow surface

of the resistance element (3) is greater than the length, measured
in the flow direction, of the widening part of the starting

section (2). 
Use of a reference impedance according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the resistance element (3) contains at

least three superposed screen layers, and a central opening (6)
is formed in the middle screen layer.
Use of a reference impedance according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the resistance element (3)

comprises a metal fabric having a mesh width of about 30 to 40 Âµm.
Use of a reference impedance according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the resistive resistance

element (3) is interchangeably fitted to the free end fo the
starting section (2) in a manually releasable snap-fastener

construction (5).
Use of a reference impedance according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a plurality of interchangeable

resistance elements (3) with different resistance values are
available which cover that part of the physiological spectrum of

human respiratory impedance which is relevant to the measurement.
Device for oscillometric, particularly impulse-oscillometric
measurement of the respiratory impedance, comprising measuring

equipment (10) including a pressure oscillation or pressure
pulse generator (11), a flow transducer (13) and a pressure

transducer (14), a mouthpiece for the patient being connectable
to said measuring equipment, and further comprising a reference

impedance for calibration of the device and/or for correcting the
measurement results obtained with the device, the reference impedance

being connected to the measuring equipment (10) instead of
the mouthpiece and having a resistive resistance element (3) with

an oncoming-flow surface extending transversely to the direction
of flow, particularly a circular screen resistor, and a pipe (1)

connected to the resistance element (3) via a flow-starting
section (2), for connection to the measuring equipment (10), the

surface (4) of the resistance element (3) opposite to the flow-starting
section being open to atmosphere, characterized in that 

the oncoming-flow surface area of the resistive resistance element
(3) is considerably greater than the cross-sectional area

of the pipe (1) at the place where it is connected to the measuring
equipment (10), and the starting section (2) widens up to
