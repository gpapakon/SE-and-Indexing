<ABSTRACT>
Applicant has demonstrated that by appropriately shaping the laser gain 
region one can control the polarization direction of semiconductor vertical cavity 

lasers and enhance their transverse mode selectivity. Specifically, configuring the 
transverse cross section to regions have a length-to-width ratio (AC/BD) in excess of 

1.2 favors emission with polarization in the long dimension at the fundamental 
mode. A cruciform structure favors emission with switchable orthogonal 

polarization. The transverse shape can be configured by dry etching a particular 
cavity shape in index guided lasers or by forming a shaped ion implantation region 

around gain guided lasers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to semiconductor lasers and, in particular, to a 
semiconductor vertical cavity laser having enhanced polarization control and 
transverse mode selectivity. A polarization switching laser is also described. Semiconductor lasers are attractive for a wide variety of applications 
including telecommunications, computing systems, optical recording systems and 
optical connection of integrated circuits. Semiconductor lasers provide a compact 
source of coherent, monochromatic light which can be modulated at high bit rates to 
transmit large amounts of information. Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) are particularly 
promising for applications requiring two dimensional arrays of lasers. As contrasted 
with edge emitting lasers which emit light parallel to the growth planes of their 
substrates, VCSELs emit light perpendicular to their substrates. A typical VCSEL 
comprises an active region sandwiched between a pair of distributed Bragg reflector 
stacks. Upon injection of suitable current through the active region, laser light is 
emitted perpendicular to the planes of growth. One difficulty with conventional VCSELs is the absence of polarization 
control and selectivity for transverse optical modes. As contrasted with edge 
emitting lasers which have long cavity lengths (100-500µm) and narrow stripe 
widths (1-10 µm), VCSELs typically have short cavity lengths (200-500 nm) and 
relatively large transverse circular areas (10-20 µm diameters). The polarization of 
emitted light is typically defined by accidental fabrication anisotropy and can vary 
from device to device, even in arrays. Moreover the lasers produce higher order 
transverse optical output at modest output power and multimode output at high 
power. The presence of higher modes, however, introduces mode competition noise 
into the optical output and complicates coupling to optical fiber. Accordingly, there 
is a need for a vertical cavity laser having enhanced polarization control and 
transverse mode selectivity.  Applicant has demonstrated that by appropriately shaping the laser gain 
region one can control the polarization direction of semiconductor vertical cavity 
lasers and enhance their transverse mode selectivity. Specifically, configuring the 
transverse cross section to regions have a length-to-width ratio in excess of 1.2 
favors emission with polarization in the long dimension at the fundamental mode. A 
cruciform structure favors emission with switchable orthogonal polarization. The
