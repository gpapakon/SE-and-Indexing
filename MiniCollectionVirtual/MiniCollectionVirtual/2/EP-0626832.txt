<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a dental floss dispenser. 
More specifically, this invention is directed to a dental floss 
dispenser formed from a plastic material capable of being molded 
into a box-like body with integral hinge members and a second 
transparent plastic material which is capable of being molded into 
window and axle assembly for insertion into the box-like body. The advantages of dental floss have been well documented and 
dental floss has been widely sold and widely used. Dental floss 
has been typically available in dispensers which permit a user to 
dispense a desired length of floss while storing the remainder of 
the unused floss in a reasonably hygienic manner. The choice of materials from which to fabricate dental floss 
dispensers are limited to those materials accepted by regulatory 
agencies as being safe for the storage of such materials and by the 
cost of such materials. These dispensers are typically fabricated 
from one type of plastic which is opaque in nature. The choice of 
the plastic is usually determined by the ability of the plastic to 
be easily and economically molded into a shape. It is also 
desirable for the plastic to posses the ability to form an integral 
or "living" hinge thereby permitting molding of moveable parts from 
a single piece of plastic. However, plastics that possess the 
ability to form a "living" hinge are typically opaque in nature and 
therefore do not permit the user to view the interior of the 
dispenser offering no opportunity for the user to determine how 
much dental floss is present in the dispenser. Transparent plastics have been used to fabricate dental floss 
dispensers. Dispensers fabricated from these materials permit one 
to view the contents of the dispenser without exposing its contents 
thereby keeping the unused portion of the dental floss in a 
reasonably hygienic state. However, the transparent materials 
typically do not offer the opportunity to include "living" hinges 
in the design of the dispenser and therefore preclude design of a  
 
dispenser with unitary hinges. Dental floss dispensers have been designed which incorporate 
a body of opaque plastic capable of forming a living hinge and 
a window of a transparent material thereby permitting a user to 
determine how much dental floss remains within the dispenser. 
However, producing such a dispenser presents difficulties since 
the transparent material must be secured to the opaque material 
thereby requiring complex molds and/or skilled assembly. Dental floss
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A dental floss dispenser comprising: 

(a) a molded unitary plastic housing (10) having a 
front section (11), a back section (12), a cover (13), a 

first hinge means (14) interposed between the front section 
and the back section and a second hinge means (15) 

interposed between the back section and the cover forming 
an enclosure for holding a filament spool (33), the front 

section being a front wall (6) with an opening (17) and a 
post (18) having a keyed profile perpendicular and adjacent 

to the opening, and a shoulder saddle (19) perpendicular to 
the front wall having a guide (20) for sliding a filament 

(34) from the enclosure and a means (21) for cutting the 
filament; and 
(b) a window assembly (25) engaged with the front 
section, the window assembly having two faces, the first face 

being arranged with a transparent raised planar section (27) 
and a peripheral flange (28) surrounding the transparent 

raised planar section and the second face being arranged 
with a column (30) in alignment with the peripheral flange 

and projecting perpendicularly from the second face, and a 
hollow shaft (31), having a circular outside diameter for 

rotatably mounting the filament spool and an axial bore 
having an internal profile complementary to the post with 

a keyed profile, aligned with the peripheral flange and 
projecting perpendicularly from the second face, wherein the 

window assembly is engaged with the molded unitary plastic 

housing by positioning the transparent raised planar section 
within the opening in the front wall and by meshing the 

axial bore with the post having a keyed profile. 
A dental floss dispenser according to claim 1 wherein the 
molded unitary plastic housing is of polypropylene. 
A dental floss dispenser according to one of claims 1 and 
2 wherein the window assembly having two faces is of 

polycarbonate.  
 
A dental floss dispenser according to any preceding claim 
wherein the window assembly having two faces is tinted. 
A dental floss dispenser according to any preceding claim 
further comprising a second post (41) formed on the front 

wall of the molded unitary plastic housing and a bore 
located axially in the column which is capable of receiving 

the second post therein.
