<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an addressing system comprising a
plurality of address predecoder circuits, first and second address
decoder units and a plurality of first and second temporary information
storage circuits.An addressing system having the features set forth in the
preamble portion of present claim 1 is known from document EP-O
370 460. Document JP-A-60 070 817 discloses a temporary information
storage circuit controllable with an enable/reset signal.A typical example of the temporary information
storage circuit device is illustrated in figure 1 of the
drawings, and largely comprises a delayed latch circuit 1
responsive to a latch control signal CTL1 for storing an
input signal IN1 and a reset circuit 2 responsive to an
enable/reset signal EBL1 for controlling the output from
the delayed latch circuit 1.The delayed latch circuit 1 comprises a memory
section 1a implemented by a loop of an inverter IV1 and a
three-state buffer 1b, an inverter IV2 for producing a
complementary signal CCTL1 of the latch control signal
CTL1 and a transfer gate 1c coupled between an inverter IV3
and a memory section 1a, and an input signal IN1 is
supplied from the inverter IV1 to the transfer gate 1c.The transfer gate 1c is implemented by a parallel 
combination of a p-channel enhancement type switching
transistor Qp1 and an n-channel enhancement type switching
transistor Qn2 coupled between the output node of the
inverter IV3 and an input node N1 of the memory circuit 1a.
While the latch control signal CTL1 remains in the high
voltage level, the p-channel enhancement type switching
transistor Qp1 and the n-channel enhancement type switching
transistor Qn2 turn on, and the input signal IN1 is
transferred to the input node N1. On the other hand, if
the latch control signal CTL1 is changed to a low
voltage level, the transfer gate 1c electrically isolates
the input node N1 from the inverter IV3.The three-state buffer 1b is a series combination of
p-channel enhancement type switching transistors Qp3 and
Qp4 and n-channel enhancement type switching transistors
Qn5 and Qn6 coupled between a power voltage line Vcc and a
ground voltage line GND.The latch control signal CTL1 and the complementary
signal CCTL1 are supplied to the gate electrode of the p-channel
enhancement type switching transistor Qp3 and the
gate electrode of the n-channel enhancement type switching
transistor Qn6. If the latch control signal CTL1 is in the
high voltage level, the p-channel enhancement type 
switching transistor Qp3 and the n-channel
