<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a system comprising elements distributed 
in three dimensions which is designed for the utilization of 

propagating energy and/or energy fields which is/are 
affected by the shape, the surface characteristics, the size, 

the composition, and particularly, the distribution of the 
elements and/or the distribution of the voids between the 

elements; all of which may function together as a system 
of modulators, detectors, demodulators, collectors, absorbers, 

transmitters, oscillators, transformational devices, 
transducers, or any combination of the above functions. 

Such a system of elements is described as having an ordered, 
three-dimensional distribution with respect to an 

orderly system of points which occur in specific relative 
positions. The interaction of propagating energy and/or 

energy fields with these systems of elements, e.g. spherical 
elements stacked in pyramids, may be utilized for the distribution, 

transmission, detection, and collection of mechanical, 
electromagnetic, magnetic, gravitational, electrostatic, 

electromechanical, and/or pressure-vacuum energy.
