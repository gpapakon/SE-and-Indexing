<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel polymeric 
blend having enhanced environmental degradability 
properties comprising a non-biodegradable thermoplastic 
polymer. There are numerous patents dealing with 
enhancing the degradability of conventional non-biodegradable 
polymers such as polyolefins by use of 
additive systems. These additive systems are quite 
frequently designed to enhance the polymers 
degradability in a specific type of environment and 
over a specific length of time. For example, U.S. 
Patent No. 3,840,512 (Brackman) exemplifies 
prodegradant systems comprising ferric stearate with 
various free fatty acids, both saturated and 
unsaturated. Manganese stearate is also exemplified in 
a system with stearic acid. Brackman states that 
thermoplastic films (e.g., polyolefin films) formed 
with these prodegradant systems will embrittle when 
exposed to artificially UV-activated irradiation at 
times ranging from 2 to 35 days. It is specifically 
stated that the nature of the hydrocarbon group on the 
fatty acid does not have a large influence on the rate 
of UV degradation. Brackman does not address the issue 
of degradability in other environments, such as in a 
compost environment. A patent dealing with a similar 
prodegradant system, U.S. Patent No. 4,067,836 (Potts 
et al.), discloses adding a transition metal salt, an 
auto-oxidative susceptible additive, and an anti-oxidant 
to polyethylene. The only exemplified auto-oxidative 
susceptible additives were polypropylene and 
polyethylene oxide (which did not work as acceptably as 
polypropylene). The degradation of the samples was  
 
tested by exposure to an artificial solar light 
spectral distribution. The degradability 
characteristics of these prodegradant additives were 
never demonstrated in other environments such as a 
compost environment. Generally, additive systems as 
described above, designed to make a polymer degrade 
when exposed to environmental radiation, have proved of 
doubtful practical utility. Only a relatively small 
portion of the waste stream is ever exposed to 
sunlight, even for short periods of time. In U.S. Patent No. 3,921,333 (Clendinning, et 
al.) it is proposed to make the composition of Potts, 
et al., discussed above, degradable in a soil type 
environment by adding a biodegradable polymer such as 
poly(caprolactone). The invention described is 
allegedly useful for materials such as transplanting 
containers, mulch film and the like. Again, only a 
small portion of the plastic in the waste stream is 
ever
