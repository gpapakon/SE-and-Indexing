<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
manufacturing an ultra-high-strength cold-rolled steel sheet
excellent in delayed fracture resistance.For the purpose of reducing the weight of an
automobile or ensuring the safety of passengers, cold-rolled
steel sheets having such a high tensile strength
as to permit achievement of a higher strength and
reduction of the weight of various structural members,
are widely used as materials for protective components of
an automobile such as a bumper reinforcement and a door
guard bar. As a cold-rolled steel sheet having such a
high tensile strength, ultra-high-strength cold-rolled
steel sheets having a tensile strength of over 981 MPa (100 kgf/mm2)
are proposed as follows:
(1) an ultra-high-strength cold-rolled steel sheet,
disclosed in Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No.
61-3,843 published on January 9, 1986, which consists
essentially of: 
carbon (C)from 0.02 to 0.30 wt.%,silicon (Si)from 0.01 to 2.5 wt.%,manganese (Mn)from 0.5 to 2.5 wt.%,andthe balance being iron (Fe) and incidentalimpurities(hereinafter referred to as the "prior art 1").(2) an ultra-high-strength cold-rolled steel sheet,
disclosed in Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No.
61-217,529 published on September 27, 1986, which
consists essentially of:
carbon (C)from 0.12 to 0.70 wt.%,silicon (Si)from 0.4 to 1.0 wt.%,manganese (Mn)from 0.2 to 2.5 wt.%,soluble aluminum (Sol.Al)from 0.01 to 0.07 wt.%,nitrogen (total N)up to 0.02 wt.%,andthe balance being iron (Fe) and incidentalimpurities(hereinafter referred to as the "prior art 2").However, the prior arts 1 and 2 described above
have the following problems:It is true that the cold-rolled steel sheets of
the prior arts 1 and 2 are excellent in workability and 
have a high tensile strength of over 981 MPa (100 kgf/mm2). An
ultra-high-strength cold-rolled steel sheet having a
tensile strength of over 981 MPa (100 kgf/mm2) is usually formed
through the bending. In the cold-rolled steel sheets of
the prior arts 1 and 2, however, when the tensile
strength of the steel sheet becomes higher over 981 MPa (100
kgf/mm2), a fracture phenomenon (hereinafter referred to
as the "delayed fracture") is suddenly caused by hydrogen
penetrating into the interior of the steel sheet under
the effect of a corrosion reaction taking place along with
the lapse of time at a portion formed by the above-mentioned
bending of the cold-rolled steel sheet.
Therefore, even with a high tensile strength, a cold-rolled
steel sheet susceptible to the delayed fracture,
has
