<ABSTRACT>
This operation control device for a contactor including a pull-in coil (1) and a coil (2) for holding a moving assembly in active position, the supply to which is governed by control means (6, 7), is characterised in that the control means include separate means (6, 9, 10) for control of the supply to the coils, receiving, as input, information on the power supply voltage of the contactor, in order:   - simultaneously to feed the two coils (1, 2) during engagement of the operation of the contactor; - cutting off the supply to the pull-in coil (1) at the end of a defined time after the engagement of the operation of the contactor; and - again supplying the pull-in coil (1) in the event of a defined fall in the power supply voltage of the contactor during the operation of the latter.

<CLAIMS>
A contactor comprising a pulling coil (1) and a 
coil (2) for holding a moving element in an operative 

position, and separate control means (6,9,10) for 
controlling the supply to the coils (1,2), characterised in 

that said means receive an input of data relating to the 
value of the supply voltage of the contactor and they are 

arranged: 

to supply simultaneously the two coils (1,2) when 
the moving element of the contactor is pulled towards its 

operative position; 
to cut off the supply to the pulling coil (1) at 
the end of a predetermined operating time of the contact 

after the moving element has been pulled towards its 
operative position; 
to resupply the pulling coil (1) in the event of 
the supply voltage of the contactor dropping below a given 

value so as to maintain the moving element in an operative 
position. 
A contactor according to claim 1, characterised in 
that each coil (1,2) is connected between a supply terminal 

and the collector of a transistor (9,10), the base of which 
is controlled by the control means (6).
