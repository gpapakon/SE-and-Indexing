<ABSTRACT>
An information processing apparatus is provided with 
a main body including a key-control section, a connecting 

section rotatably provided with respect to the main body 
and an input display section which is rotatably connected 

to the connecting section and enables pen-input. The 
information processing apparatus is capable of taking 

three positions: a stored position, a key-input position 
and a pen-input position. The center of rotation of the 

input display section and the connecting section is set at 
the back of the input display section. The connecting 

section serves as a stopper for controlling the rotating 
movement of the connecting section, and enables the 

rotatable range of the input display section to be 
controlled within 180° without requiring a special 

mechanism. Thus, the input display section can be 
prevented from contacting the key-control section of the 

main body by over-rotating in the pen-input position. 
Moreover, since the input display section is supported by 

the connecting section, the input display section can be 
held in stable conditions both in the key-input position 

and in the pen-input position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information
processing apparatus such as a word processor, a personal
computer, etc., which is provided with a key-control
section such as a key board and an input display section
whereon input is permitted using a pen.Conventionally, key-input using a keyboard has been
accepted as the most common input method for a
simplified-type information processing apparatus.
Recently, a pen-input technique using a tablet integrated
with a display screen has been developed, which enables
character and image input handwritten with a pen, editing
by hand, etc. Generally, when carrying out a key-input operation,
it is preferable to carry out touch-typing with a display
screen placed in front of the user and a keyboard placed
below the display screen. Therefore, this position is
considered as the standard position in carrying out a
key-input operation.When carrying out a pen input operation, a tablet
surface which serves as a display screen is preferably
placed facing upward so that the user can input with a pen
as if writing characters on a sheet placed on the desk.
Therefore, this position is considered as the standard
position in carrying out a pen-input operation.For the above simplified-type information processing
apparatus, it is required to be stored compact so that it
is well suited for portable use.Therefore, the simplified-type information processing
apparatus is required to take the following three
positions: a stored position at which a display screen of
the display section is folded so as to face the keyboard
provided in the main body; a key-input position at which
the display screen of the display section forms a
predetermined angle to the main body so that key-input is
permitted at the standard position; and a pen-input
position at which the display screen of the display
section is placed nearly flat above the keyboard so that 
pen-input operation can be carried out at the standard
pen-input position.The simplified information processing apparatus which
can take the above three positions is disclosed in
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 188213/1992
(Tokukaihei 4-188213), Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Publication No. 188214/1992 (Tokukaihei 4-188214),

(Tokukaihei 4-218820), and Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Publication No. 221989/1992 (Tokukaihei 4-221989).The information processing apparatus disclosed in the

includes a top cover provided so as to be rotatable with
