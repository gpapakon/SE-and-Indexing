<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a current regulation method and to a device for a constant-voltage converter, a current component (isp) which forms a flux and a current component (isq) which forms the torque of a derived actual current vector (is) each being regulated to a desired current component (i*sp, i*sq) of a required current vector (i*s), a regulator controlled variable ( DELTA u*sp,  DELTA u*sq) in each case having a servo variable (u*spvor, u*sqvor) superimposed on it. According to the invention, the regulator controlled variable ( DELTA u*sq) which forms the torque acts on the regulator controlled variable ( DELTA u*sp) which forms a flux, delayed as a function of a frequency variable ( tau k omega s). A current regulation method is thus obtained which combines the advantages of two-component current regulation and in-phase currents (real current) regulation without their disadvantages, without having to switch over between the two types of regulation in so doing.

Current-control method for a voltage-injecting

a flow-forming current component (i
