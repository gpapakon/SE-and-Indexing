<ABSTRACT>
The pinned disc mill has interacting pin discs (14a,14b) with at least one of them driven by a shaft (23a,23b) rotatable in rolling bearings. The roller bearings of each shaft are mounted in a separate bearing cup (1a,1b), with a thermally insulating space (4a,4b) existing between each bearing cup and mill casing (3). The insulating space is purged through by a gaseous form medium which may be preheated. The bearing cups are connected to the mill casing by temperature insulating bushes (2a,2b).

<CLAIMS>
Pin mill for cold milling of material to be milled with two pin disks (14a, 14b) arranged opposite one another and co-operating with one another to mill the material, in which at least one of the two pin disks (14a, 14b) is driven by means of a shaft (23a, 23b) rotatable in roller bearings, with a mill housing (3) to receive the two pin disks (14a, 14b), and an inlet (5) for material to be milled and an outlet chamber (16) for fine material, and means for flushing diaphragm seals (11, 12, 13, 21a, 21b) between the inlet (5) for material to be milled and the outlet chamber (16) for fine material of the pin mill, 
characterised in that
 the roller bearings of each rotatable shaft (23a, 23b) are held in a separate bearing cup (1a, 1b), with an insulating chamber (4a, 4b) which is located between each bearing cup (1a, 1b) and the mill housing (3) and separates the bearing cups (1a, 1b) thermally from the mill housing (3).
Pin mill according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the insulating chambers (4a, 4b) can be flushed with a gaseous medium.
Pin mill according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the gaseous medium is preheated.
Pin mill according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the bearing cups (1a, 1b) are connected to the mill
 housing (3) by means of temperature-insulating bushes (2a and 2b).
Pin mill according to claims 1 to 4, 
characterised by
 at least one further housing chamber (19a, 19b) which is separated from the insulating chamber (4a, 4b) and serves for distributing a flushing medium to the diaphragm seals (11, 12, 13, 21a, 21b).
Pin mill according to claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the flushing medium is cooled.
Pin mill according to claim 5 or 6, 
characterised in that
 the flushing medium can be introduced into the diaphragm seals (11, 12, 13, 21a, 21b) through passages (10, 20a, 20b) distributed uniformly.
Pin mill according to claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 at least one of the two shafts (23a, 23b) exhibits a thermally insulating cover.
