<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for detecting certain load fault conditions of gaseous luminous 
tube loads connected to high voltage, high frequency power supplies including open-circuit, 

broken tube and other balanced load fault conditions. The detector includes 
a filter for emphasizing the harmonic content of the power supply output, an attenuator, 

a comparator or other detector/threshold device, and a delay circuit. A power supply 
shut-down switch may be included or the present fault detector may be interconnected 

to shut-down switch of a conventional ground fault interrupter. In one embodiment the 
filter and attenuator and, in another, the filter, attenuator, and delay circuit employ 

common components and may include a filter/attenuator capacitor defined by placement 
of metalization on the high frequency power supply transformer adjacent a high 

voltage output lead.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to high frequency power supplies for neon and
other gaseous luminous tubes and, more specifically, to apparatus for the sensing of
certain anomalous load or load fault conditions and for the subsequent interruption of
the supply output in response thereto.Ground fault detection is a well known subset of load fault
detection/interruption in which an unbalanced load is detected by monitoring for any
'differential', i.e. unequal, currents between the respective high voltage output leads.
Such unbalances are, by definition, the result of a shunting of current through a
ground return path. Under ordinary circumstances these ground fault currents are
caused by human contact with, for example, an exposed connection of a luminous
neon sign. Upon detection of such a 'fault' condition, the power supply is generally
disabled until cessation of the fault condition. In this manner the principal objective
of this form of load fault detection and interruption -- the protection of persons and
pets against electrical shock -- is achieved.GB-A-2211038 describes a protective electronic ballast circuit for fluorescent
lamps which seeks to detect the presence of a load fault current of a comparatively
large, short circuit nature.
When there is a short in the lamp circuit, a current surge
is detected and smoothed via a low pass filter, causing the
breakdown of a voltage threshold detecting means which
will trigger switching means to turn off the ballast.
The specification also discloses the use of a filter circuit
for filtering out harmonic interference. FR-A-2646538 discloses a detection circuit as used on an automobile in which
the current detecting circuitry is inhibited during a starting phase by delay means to
avoid false-triggering of the protection device.It is deemed prudent, however, to provide power supply interruption in
response to other anomalous operating conditions, for example, following the failure
of one or more luminous tube sign segments, due to breakage or otherwise.
Convention ground fault interruption circuits have not always proved satisfactory
under the diversity of load fault conditions associated with neon tube failure or
breakage.In multiple tube luminous sign topologies, where for example two or more
neon tube segments are placed in an electrical 'series' configuration, the breakage of
one tube often precipitates a current imbalance not too dissimilar to that caused by
inadvertent human contact. Due to the inherent distributed capacitance of neon tube
segments, the

Load fault interrupter apparatus for high frequency luminous tube power
supplies comprising means (34) operatively connected to the power supply output for

selectively passing harmonic energy; detector means (38,48) connected to the
passing means for producing a detected signal representative of the magnitude of

energy from the passing means; switch means (16) operatively connected to the
detector means for terminating power supply operation when the detected signal

exceeds a predetermined level; delay means (42,54) operatively connected to the
detector means for inhibiting operation of the switch means for a predetermined

interval such that a detected signal exceeding the predetermined level caused by the
ordinary turn-on and gas ionization of a luminous tube will not result in power supply

shut-down whereby the power supply shall be shut-down only in response to genuine
load fault conditions.
A load fault interrupter apparatus as claimed in claim 1 and further comprising
attenuating means (34) operatively connected between the power supply and the

switch means for lowering the level of the detected signal to the switch means.
A load fault interrupter apparatus as claimed in claim 2 wherein the passing
means and the attenuator means are integrally defined by a single RC network (44,46)

operatively connected to the power supply output comprising a series capacitance (44)
and shunt impedance (46).
A load fault interrupter as claimed in claim 3 in which said passing and
attenuating means functions are achieved by selection of a low-valued series 

capacitance (44) less than about 10 picofarads; said capacitance being formed and
defined as the capacitance between an output lead (72,73) of the power supply and a

metallized connection (70) adjacent to, but not in direct physical contact with, said
output lead.
A load fault interrupter as claimed in claim 4 in which the series capacitance
metallized connection is affixed to the output winding insulation means.
A load fault interrupter as claimed in claim 1 wherein the means for
selectively passing harmonic energy is defined as a single-pole RC network (44,46)

having a cut-off frequency higher than the power supply operating frequency whereby
the harmonic content of the power supply output will be passed through the passing

means with less attenuation than the fundamental output of the power supply thereby
emphasizing the harmonic content of the power supply output while simultaneously

maintaining a continued responsiveness to the fundamental content of the power
supply output whereby increases in harmonic components of the power supply output

aid in the detection of open circuit and load fault conditions.
A load fault interrupter as claimed in claim 2 wherein the means for passing
harmonic energy defines a cut-off frequency, said cut-off frequency being

substantially higher than the operating frequency of the high frequency power supply
whereby said substantially higher cut-off frequency results in the passing means

providing increased attenuation compared to a conventional passing means having a
cut-off frequency in the order of the operating frequency thereby serving the

additional function of said attenuating means.
A load fault interrupter as claimed in claim 2 wherein the means for passing 
harmonic energy defines a cut-off frequency, said cut-off frequency is at least 1000

times greater than the operating frequency of the power supply whereby the harmonic
passing means provides increased attenuation compared to a conventional passing

means having a cut-off frequency in the order of the operating frequency thereby
serving additionally the function of said attenuating means.
A load fault interrupter as claimed in claim 2 including a series capacitor (44)
connected to the power supply output and a shunt impedance (46), said series

capacitor and shunt impedance defining said means for passing and for attenuating
detector means (48) being operably connected to the series capacitance and shunt

impedance, the detector means having a rectified output representative of the passed
and attenuated power supply output, the detector means including a shunt detector

filter capacitor (52) connected across the rectified output of the detector means; the
series capacitance and shunt filter capacitor defining the delay means; the series

capacitance being substantially less than the shunt capacitance whereby multiple high
frequency power supply cycles are required to charge the shunt detector capacitor

through the series capacitor thereby defining the delay function.
