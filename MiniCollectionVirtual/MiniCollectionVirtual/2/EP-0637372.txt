<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to fiber optic 
gyroscopes (gyros) and particularly to a closed loop fiber 
optic gyro having a signal processing arrangement which 
features improved gyro performance. It is well established that closed loop fiber optic 
gyro signal processing can be achieved through ramp phase 
modulation. Arrangements for accomplishing this are 
described in the following references: Progress In 
Optical Fiber Gyroscopes Using Integrated Optics, Lefevre, 
et al, 37th Meeting of the Electromagnetic Wave 
Propagation Panel of the Advisory Group for Aerospace 
Research and Development (NATO), Istanbul, Turkey, 
September 23 - 27, 1985; Double Closed-Loop Hybrid Fiber 
Gyroscope Using Digital Phase Ramp, Lefevre, et al, 
Proceedings of the Conference on Optical Fiber Sensors, 
Optical Society of America, February 11 - 14, 1985; and 
Utilization of Fiber Optic Gyros in Inertial Measurement 
Units, Matthews, The Institute of Navigation Proceedings 
of the National Technical Meeting, January 23 - 25, 1990. 
Integrated Optics: A Practical Solution For The Fiber 
Optic Gyroscope, SPIE, Vol. 719, Fiber Optic Gyros: 10th 
Anniversary Conference Proceedings (1986). H.C. Lefevre, 
et al describes integrated optics as a practical solution 
for the fiber optic Gyroscope because of the ability to 
integrate in a single circuit all optical functions 
required of the gyroscope system. The reference teaches a  
 
"reciprocal" configuration to insure a stable bias, 
signal processing for maximum sensitivity, a broadband 
source to eliminate the spurious influence of back 
reflections and closed loop operation to linearize scale 
factor and to improve its stability.  
 The present invention will be described with 
reference to a "minimum reciprocal configuration" fiber 
optic gyro which acts as an optical interferometer. The 
desired optical phase shifts in the interferometer are 
derived from two sources: (1) the Sagnac phase shift from 
a rotation rate imposed on a fiber optic coil through 
which clockwise and counterclockwise light beams travel; 
and (2) phase shifts imposed by a phase modulator. The invention uses square wave phase modulation in 
order to create an output error signal. A square wave is 
applied to an optical phase modulator. This generates 
phase signatures for the clockwise and counterclockwise 
light beams. The difference between the two signatures is 
applied to a phase difference-intensity transfer function 
to determine output intensity. If the Sagnac phase shift 
is constant,

<CLAIMS>
A method for improving the performance of a 
fiber optic gyro comprising the steps of providing 

clockwise and counterclockwise light beams traveling 
around a fiber optic coil and using square wave phase 

modulation in a phase nulling feedback loop for developing 
an error signal corresponding to the phase difference 

between the clockwise and counterclockwise beams, said 
method characterized by: 


applying square wave phase modulation to a 
modulation drive signal after overflow logic for 

preventing a phase modulation ramp from exceeding 
overflow/underflow logic limits; 
the phase modulation causing a retrace with each 
modulation period when the amplitude of the ramp is within 

selected limits; and 
excluding the square wave amplitude from a 
modulation cycle immediately after a retrace from the 

phase nulling feedback loop, whereby the phase nulling 
feedback loop has more accurate input data to accomplish 

phase nulling for effectively improving gyro performance. 
A method as described by claim 1, wherein:
 
   applying square wave modulation to the 

modulation drive signal after overflow logic includes 
adding the square wave modulation to the modulation drive 

signal.  
 
A method as described by claim 1, wherein: 

excluding the square wave amplitude from a 
modulation cycle immediately after a retrace from the 

phase nulling loop includes: 
designating said square wave amplitude as errant 
data. 
A method as described by claim 3, including:
 
   following a reset, repeating the square wave 

amplitude from a preceding modulation cycle as input data 
to the phase nulling feedback loop, thereby preventing the 

use of the errant data containing reset errors in the 
phase nulling feedback loop. 
A fiber optic gyro (2) of the type comprising 
clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) light beams 

traveling around a fiber optic coil (6) and having square 
wave phase modulation (32) in a phase nulling feedback 

loop (Figure 1) for developing an error signal 
corresponding to the phase difference between the 

clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) beams, including 
an arrangement for improving gyro (2) 

performance characterized by: 

means for excluding the square 
wave amplitude from a modulation cycle immediately after a 

retrace from the phase nulling feedback loop; and 
said phase nulling feedback loop (Figure 1) 
thereby having more accurate input data to accomplish 

phase nulling and for improving gyro (2) performance. 
A gyro as described by claim 5, including:
 
   means for indicating that the 

square wave amplitude from a modulation cycle immediately 
after a retrace is errant data, whereby said data is 

excluded from the phase nulling feedback loop by the 
excluding means. 
A gyro as described by claim 6, including:
 
   means for applying the square 

wave amplitude from a preceding modulation cycle to the 
phase nulling feedback loop, whereby errant data 

containing reset errors is excluded from the phase nulling 
feedback loop.
