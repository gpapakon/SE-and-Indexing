<ABSTRACT>
A flame tube boiler which automatically keeps itself during operation and is suitable for operation with powdery, ash-containing fuels, has smoke tubes (9) with trumpet-like flaring inflow openings (15) in the wall (16) that separates the boiler drum from a deflection chamber (4). The flame tube (2) is sized so that, taking into an account the output of the boiler, the flue gasses at the flame tube outlet are cooled down by a safety margin that means below the ash softening point of the fuel used. The number and inner diameter (R) of the smoke tubes (9) are determined so that a dynamic pressure not lower than 40 Pa is set therein. A blow pipe (13) that blows approximately in the tangential direction to the partition in order to keep the inlet openings free from ash deposits is mounted on the deflection chamber (4).

<CLAIMS>
A fire-tube boiler containing, in a boiler drum (1), at 
least one horizontally arranged fire tube (2) which is 

provided at one end with an extension (3) for the connecting 
of the burner, a reversing chamber (4) at one end of the 

boiler drum into which an outlet of the fire tube 
debouches at the other end thereof, and a plurality of 

flue tubes (9) which have an inside diameter 2R and extend, 
starting from the reversing chamber, below the fire tube 

through the boiler drum, characterized by the fact that 

each of the flue tubes (9) has an inlet opening 
which widens from the inside diameter (2R) in the 

direction towards the reversing chamber (4) into 
which it debouches, in trumpet-like manner with a 

radius of curvature r over an axial distance of 
approximately r, r/R being 
>
 0.3, 
the dimensions of the fire tube (2), with due 
consideration of the boiler capacity and the 

desired temperature of the boiler water, are so 
selected that, in operation, the temperature of the 

flue gases at the outlet end of the fire tube (2) 
lies a safety margin below the ash-softening 

temperature of the corresponding fuel, and 
the number and inside diameter (2R) of the flue 
tubes (9) are so dimensioned that the dynamic  

 
pressure in the flue tubes (9) at a point (B) 

directly behind the trumpet-shaped widening is 
greater than 40 Pa. 
A fire-tube boiler according to Claim 1, characterized 
by the fact that said ratio is 0.8 
>
 r/R 
>
 0.5. 
A fire-tube boiler according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized by the fact that the number and the inside 

diameter (2R) of the flue tubes (9) are so dimensioned 
that the dynamic pressure in the flue tubes (9) at the 

point (B) directly behind the trumpet-shaped widening is 
between 80 and 200 Pa. 
A fire-tube boiler according to any of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized by the fact that the fire tube (2) is 

provided, below the extension (3) for the connection of 
a burner, with at least one blast tube (12) which 

debouches into the fire tube (2). 
A fire-tube boiler according to any of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized by the fact that the reversing chamber (4) 

is provided with a plurality of blast tubes (17) which 
have mouths which are opposite the inlet openings of the 

flue tubes (9). 
A fire-tube boiler according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized by the fact that at least one side  

 
wall (7) of the reversing chamber (4) is passed through 

by at least one blast tube (13) the direction of blast 
of which is at least approximately parallel to a 

partition wall (16) having the flue-tube inlet opening 
which separates the reversing chamber (4) from the 

boiler drum (1) and the cross section of the blast jet 
of which passes over all flue tube inlet openings. 
A fire-tube boiler according to Claim 6, characterized by the fact that said 
at least one blast tube (12) is connected via a valve 

(20) to a gas pressure accumulator (21). 
A fire-tube boiler according to Claim 6 or 7, 
characterized by the fact that the direction of the jet 

of at least one blast tube (13) forms an angle of about 
10Â° with the partition wall (16). 
A fire-tube boiler according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized by the fact that the reversing 

chamber (4) has an ash outlet (24, 10) in its lower 
region. 
A fire-tube boiler according to Claim 9, characterized 
by the fact that the reversing chamber has an obliquely 

downward extending bottom wall (23) and the ash outlet 
(24, 10) is arranged asymmetric to the center plane of 

the reversing chamber (4) at the lower end of the bottom  
 

wall (23). 
A fire-tube boiler according to either of Claims 9 and 
10, characterized by the fact that a blast tube (17) the 

direction of blast of which is directed at the ash 
outlet (24, 10) debouches into the reversing chamber (4) 

in the lower region thereof. 
A fire-tube boiler according to any of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized by the fact that a side wall (7) of the 

reversing chamber (4) is passed through by a blast tube 
(13) the direction of blast of which is at least 

approximately parallel to a partition wall (16) having 
the flue tube inlet openings which separates the 

reversing chamber (4) from the boiler drum (1) and the 
cross section of the blast jet of which passes over all 

flue tube inlet openings; that said blast tube (13) is 
connected via a valve (20) to a gas pressure accumulator 

(21), the reversing chamber (4) has an oblique bottom 
wall (23) which extends obliquely downward commencing 

from the side wall (7) having the blast tube (13); and 
that an ash-outlet (24, 10) is arranged at the lower end 

of the bottom wall (23) asymmetric to the center plane 
of the reversing chamber (4).
