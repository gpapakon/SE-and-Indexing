<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transducer structure (10) having a 
top insulator substrate (22) and a bottom insulator substrate 

(24) and a plurality of conductive capacitor plates (12,14).
 

A conductive network facilitates the electrostatic bond between 

a semiconductor wafer (20) and the top and bottom insulator 
substrates (22,24). The improvement in the conductive network 

comprises a first conductive grid (150) and a second conductive 
grid (170). When an electrostatic voltage is applied between the 

first and second grids (150, 170) an electric field substantially 
encircles each capacitor area to thereby create an electrostatic 

bond therearound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates
to a diaphragm capacitive
pressure transducer and a method for fabricating. Transducers are devices which function generally to
convert an input of one form into an output of another
form or magnitude. Many types of transducers are
available for converting light to electrical signals,
mechanical energy to electrical signals, temperature to
pressure, pressure to electrical signals, etc., and vice
versa. In other instances, transducers can simply
modify an input stimulus, such as change an input
pressure to another pressure, an input amplitude to a
different output amplitude, etc. Equipment or apparatus
which operates between different types of energy
generally requires one type of transducer or another.
Based upon the application, transducers can range from
inexpensive to very expensive, depending on the
precision, accuracy, reliability, etc. required.In the present market, the largest number of
pressure to voltage conversion devices (pressure
transducers) are piezoresistive. These devices are
strain sensitive rather than displacement sensitive.
However, for pressure ranges less than a psi FS (Full
Span), capacitive displacement transducers are
predominantly employed. The capacitance is sensed by
electrical circuits to provide an output voltage
corresponding to the change in pressure. Highly
developed silicon semiconductor processing techniques
have given rise to the use of such material as flexible
clamped transducer diaphragms which move in response to
pressure and provide an output change in electrical
resistance or capacitance. Such transducers are
disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,495,820; 4,424,713;
4,390,925 and 4,542,435. The use of silicon
semiconductor material as a pressure transducer
diaphragm is a relatively new innovation, and thus many 
fabrication and operational uncertainties still exist.
For example, the characterization and mathematical
modeling of silicon, when employed as a flexible
membrane, is not well known. Therefore, it has been
difficult to predict silicon diaphragm transducer
performance which exhibits predefined characteristics
over a wide range of applications. In addition, the
fabrication of such type of transducer has been
accompanied by many problems, one of which is that such
a conductive diaphragm of the clamped type must be fixed
or anchored at its peripheral edge, and electrically
insulated from spaced capacitor plates. Such an
interface requires different materials with the
attendant problems of attachment, relative temperature
expansion,

The transducer of Claim 2, further including a thick semiconductor

   said deflectable semiconductor diaphragm (16) is fabricated from a material having
a thermal characteristic different from that of said support structures (22, 24) and is

substantially thinner than said support structures (22, 24) such that the thermal expansion
characteristics of said support structures (22, 24) predominate and such that when the

temperature of said support structures (22, 24) and said semiconductor diaphragm (16) is
changed and then the support structures (22, 24) and semiconductor diaphragm (16) are

sandwiched and fixed together and said temperature is again changed, said semiconductor
diaphragm (16) remains fixed in a tensioned state.

temperature range so that a tension in said diaphragm structure (16) remains essentially
unchanged when functioning in said operating temperature range,but which is different from that of

changing the temperature of said first and second types of material outside said
operating temperature range such that each said material undergoes a different

dimensional change; and
