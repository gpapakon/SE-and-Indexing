<ABSTRACT>
A digital communication system (e.g., 10) including a Viterbi 
decoder for tracing a path through a trellis of individual state information and 

method of operation are disclosed. The traceback determines a decoded 
symbol. The trellis of surviving branch data is stored in an array of registers. 
Operating the system includes initiating a first traceback from a 
storage register at a first symbol instant. The traceback traces a path back 

through the trellis a first predetermined number of symbol instants to 
determine a first decoded symbol. A second traceback is also initiated at the 

first symbol instant and traces a path back through the trellis a second 
predetermined number symbol instants to determine a second decoded symbol. 

The first traceback length may be greater than, less than or equal to the second 
traceback length. 
In another embodiment of the invention several tracebacks can be 
executed having a fixed traceback length, followed by other tracebacks having 

incrementally different traceback lengths. Such multiple tracebacks may be 

initiated in a single symbol instant. 
In yet another embodiment of the invention, selective ones of the 
decoded symbols are used by an equalizer to provide channel 

adaptation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to radio transmission such as digital 
cellular telephony and particularly to estimating distortion in a received signal 
so that the distortion can be reduced. Radio waves propagate at the speed of light. In cellular radio 
transmissions, a transmitted signal can arrive at a receiver at multiple times 
due to refraction, diffraction or reflection. Refraction occurs when the path of 
propagation of the transmitted signal bends to follow the curvature of the earth. 
Diffraction occurs when the path of propagation passes around obstacles. 
Reflection occurs when a transmitted signal bounces off of either the 
atmosphere, or obstacles in the path of propagation such as terrain, water tanks 
or buildings. Each of these phenomena can contribute to a multiplicity of 
signals being received at the receiver. Each of these signals was initially the 
originally transmitted signal. Each of the received signals is distorted by the 
particular path it transverses. Each signal is received at slightly different times 
due to the differences in the length of the path of propagation. Relative motion 
between a transmitter and receiver further contribute to variations in the 
received signal. When the transmitted signal is digital symbols, intersymbol 
interference occurs and may extend over several symbol time periods. The 
receiver must reliably extract the transmitted signal from these various received 
signals. Time division multiple access encoded information is transmitted in 
multiple channels per carrier. In accordance with the Group Special Mobile 
(GSM) standard, there are eight channels per carrier. Each channel is provided 
a time period for transmission called a transmission burst. Some of the bits in 
each transmission burst are set aside as a training bits for system use. The bits 
of the training segment, or a portion of them, have been used as a means to 
adapt the decoding process to compensate for channel characteristics. 
However, these bits are received only once during each transmission burst 
whereas the channel characteristics can change over the entire time during 
which the transmission burst is transmitted. When the channel characteristics 
change during the entire transmission burst, the channel estimates obtained  
 
using training bits are not representative of the channel characteristics of the 
entire frame, particularly at the two extreme ends of the transmission burst. A Viterbi decoder is a maximum likelihood decoder that provides 
forward error
