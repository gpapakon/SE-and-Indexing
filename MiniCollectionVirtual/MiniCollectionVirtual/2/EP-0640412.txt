<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a device for cleaning or polishing a roll (4), mounted so as to rotate about an axis, comprising a cleaning roller (41) mounted so as to rotate on a support member which includes two parallel arms (15, 16) which extend respectively between an internal end (15a, 16a) and an external end (15b, 16b) and which can move between a position in which the roller (41) is applied against the roll (4) and a retracted position, and means for controlling the rotation of the roller (41) about its axis x'x. According to the invention, the external ends (15b, 16b) of the two support arms (15, 16) are articulated about an axis y'y parallel to the axis of the roll (4) respectively on two aligned fixed bearings (7, 7') and can pivot simultaneously about the said axis y'y, for applying the roller (41) against the roll (4), and the rotation of the roller is controlled by a rotary member (27) centred on the said pivoting axis y'y and is transmitted to a driven end (19) of the roller (41) via a kinematic chain (26) mounted on the corresponding support arm (15) so as to pivot with the latter about the axis y'y of the control member (27).
