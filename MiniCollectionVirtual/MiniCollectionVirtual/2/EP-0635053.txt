<DESCRIPTION>
The invention comprises a novel enzyme, which is a rhamnogalacturonan
acetyl Esterase (the abbreviation RGAE will usually be used in the following), a
corresponding DNA sequence, a vector, a transformed host, a method for
production of an RGAE, an enzyme preparation, and a use of the RGAE.The invention provides the characterization, the detection and description
of a novel RGAE, a partial amino acid sequence of this enzyme, partial DNA
sequences, and a total amino acid sequence and a total DNA sequence.RGAE is a hydrolase with the systematic enzyme name
rhamnogalacturonan acetic-ester acetylhydrolase, which belongs to the group of
acetyl esterases (EC no. 3.1.1.6), which catalyze the hydrolysis of acetic esters to
the corresponding alcohols and acetate.Polysaccharides (e.g. pectins) from plants are frequently substituted with
acetyl groups (Rombouts, F.M., J.F. Thibault, C. Mercier, "Oxidative enzyme-catalyzed
crosslinking of beet pectins", US Patent No. 4,672,034). In the applications
of polysaccharides these substitutions influence the gelation properties (Williamson
G., C.B. Faulds; JA Matthew, D.B. Archer, V.J. Morris, G.J. Brownsey, M.J, Ridout,
"Gelation of sugarbeet and citrus pectins using enzymes extracted from orange
peel", Carbohydrate Polymers 13, 387-397, 1990). In the processing of plant material,
e.g. fruits and vegetables, endogenous enzymes are used as processing aids to
improve yield and quality of the end product (Pilnik, W., A.G.J. Voragen., "Effect of
enzyme treatment on the quality of processed fruits and vegetables", in: Jen J.J.,
"Quality factors of fruits and vegetables, chemistry and technology", ACS Symp. Ser.
405. American Chemical Society, Washington DC, 250-269, 1989). Schols et al.
isolated and characterized from apple cell walls an acidic polymeric pectin fragment
by the use of a technical enzyme preparation containing pectolytic, hemicellulolytic
and cellulolytic enzymes. This enzyme resistant polysaccharide, called "modified 
hairy region" (MHR) consists of a highly branched rhamnogalacturonan backbone,
with acetyl groups on the galacturonic acid residues (Schols, H.A., M.A. Posthumus,
A.G.J. Voragen, "Structural features of hairy regions of pectins isolated from apple
juice produced by the liquefaction process", Carbohydrate Research, 206, 117-129,
1990). Extensive screening of commercial enzyme preparations have led to an
Aspergillus aculeatus preparation, which was able to degrade MHR. A novel enzyme
called rhamnogalacturonase (RG) was identified and purified from
