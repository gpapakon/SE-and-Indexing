<ABSTRACT>
A [lacuna] onto a binding-means roll, with a winding core and with binding means located thereon, for machines for the tying of packages, the binding means being assigned a reflecting surface for especially photoelectric scanning for the purpose of marking its initial portion near the winding core, is characterised by an ass
ignment of the reflecting surface to the initial portion of the binding means near the roll, such that, when the spent binding means exposes the reflecting surface, the initial portion still located on the winding core has a length which is sufficient for tying one package. The invention thus teaches, on the one hand, to activate the binding-means end marking only when there is still a binding-means portion sufficiently long for a further tying operation, and, on the other hand, nevertheless no longer to use up this portion which is available per se. This ensures, on the one hand, that there is no possibility of a machine fault, for example because there is no longer a sufficient residue of binding means for tying a package, and at the same time, on the other hand, that only an optimised minimum length of no longer utilisable binding-means material remains.

<CLAIMS>
Roll of material, in particular roll of strapping means, comprising a winding core 
and material (12) situated thereon for machines (12) for processing the material 

(12), in particular strapping means for machines for strapping packages, a 
photoelectrically scannable reflecting surface (14) being provided as part of an 

adhesive tape (13) applied to the outer surface of the winding core (10) in order to 
determine the quantity of material (12) remaining on the outer surface of the 

winding core (10), characterised in that the reflecting surface (14) is associated with 
the leading-end portion of the material (12) close to the roll in such a manner that, 

when the reflecting surface is freed as the material is used, the leading-end portion 
(11) still situated on the winding core (10) has a length sufficient for processing and 

in that the leading end of the material (12) is simultaneously affixed to the winding 
core (10) by means of the adhesive tape. 
Roll of material according to claim 1, characterised in that the adhesive tape 
consists of a shortened portion of a self-adhesive reflector tape.
