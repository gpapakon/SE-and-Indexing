<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a wall insulation (1) for insulating 
a wall (2) with a plastic profile system (3) comprising insulating 

plate-like material (8), which profile system comprises
 

   a plastic socle profile (4) for fixing to the wall, and
 

   a plastic edge profile (5) which is provided with a closing 
edge for enclosing the plate material and with a supporting 

edge for receiving coating material to be arranged on the 
plate material, wherein the socle profile and the edge 

profile are provided with co-acting coupling means, and to 
the plastic profile system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wall insulation and 
to a plastic profile system therefor. The present invention 
relates more in particular to a wall insulation wherein 
insulating plate-like materials such as of polystyrene and 
mineral wool are arranged on the wall with this plastic 
profile system. In the case of a building this can take place 
on the inside and on the outside. Known wall insulations for this purpose have the 
drawback that when diverse coating materials are used for the 
visual layer, different profiles must be used in each case, 
while such profiles corrode immediately or after a period of 
time due to the alkaline conditions present or formed in the 
coating material. After a time the wall insulation will 
therefore no longer meet the demands made thereof. The present invention has for its object to provide a 
wall insulation and a profile system therefor which 
substantially does not display the above stated drawbacks. This is achieved according to the invention with a wall 
insulation according to the invention for insulating a wall 
with a plastic profile system comprising insulating plate-like 
material, which profile system comprises:
 
   a plastic socle profile for fixing to the wall, and
 
   a plastic edge profile which is provided with a closing 
edge for enclosing the plate material and with a supporting 
edge for receiving coating material to be arranged on the 
plate material, wherein the socle profile and the edge 
profile are provided with co-acting coupling means. By making use of socle profiles and edge profiles for 
mutual coupling the wall insulation according to the 
invention can be continuously adapted to the thicker or 
thinner coating material for use, while corrosion problems 
substantially do not occur. According to an embodiment of the coupling means 
according to the invention the socle profile is provided with  
 
a free leg standing away from the wall having at least one 
hooking edge comprised by the coupling means and behind which 
hooks an edging profile edge. For an optimum coupling between 
the socle profile and the edge profile it is herein 
recommended that the socle profile is provided with two 
hooking edges and the profile with two co-acting socle 
profile hooking edges. In preference a first socle profile hooking edge is 
formed in the surface of the free leg. It is thus possible to 
form the socle profile hooking edge in the surface directed 
toward the insulating plate-like material or toward the 
usually bottom surface remote
