<ABSTRACT>
A solid state relay comprises a radiator (203), a 
control circuit block (210) and a power circuit cartridge 

(202). The radiator (203) has a base portion (203b) and 
fins (203a) extending from this base portion. The control 

circuit block (210) includes a printed circuit board (227) 
having a pair of input terminals (5), a pair of load 

terminals (6), and a control circuit (9). The control 
circuit block is attached to a front surface of the base 

portion of the radiator. The power circuit cartridge (202) 
includes therein a power semiconductor element (11) which 

is turned on or off by the control circuit (9) in the 
control circuit block, an absorber (12) which is connected 

between the pair of load terminals (6), and a heat 

radiating plate (266) to radiate a heat of the power 
semiconductor element (11). The power circuit cartridge 

(202) is detachably attached to the radiator so as to be 
electrically connected to the control circuit block. The 

control circuit block has a box-shaped enclosing portion 
(221c) to enclose the printed circuit board. At least two 

groove portions (296) are formed on the front surface of 
the base portion of the radiator. The box-shaped enclosing 

portion (221c) is inserted into one of said groove portions  
 

and in this inserting state, the printed circuit board is 
vertical for the base portion front surface. The power 

circuit cartridge is inserted into the other groove 
portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid
state relay in which the on/off switching operation of
a power source is executed by a semiconductor power
element (solid state semiconductor switching element)
such as thyristor or triac and a load is turned on
or off (see for example Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 9, No 169 (E-328), 13 July 1985).Hitherto, a solid state relay as shown in
Fig. 42 has been known as such a kind of solid state
relay. In the diagram, reference numeral 511 denotes
a control circuit and 512 indicates a power circuit.
A series circuit of a light emitting element L such
as a light emitting diode and a resistor R41 is connected
between a pair of input terminals I1 and I2 in the
control circuit 511.On the other hand, first and second electrodes
T1 and T2 of a semiconductor power element Q, e.g.,
triac are connected between power source terminals
P1 and P2 in the power circuit 512. An anode and a 
cathode of a photo sensing element J, e.g., a photo
thyristor are connected between a trigger terminal G of
the triac Q and the first electrode T1 through a resistor
R42. Further, a resistor R43 is connected between the
second electrode T2 of the triac and the trigger terminal
G.In addition, a series circuit consisting of
a resistor R44 for surge prevention and a capacitor C
and an absorber consisting of a varistor Ba are connected
in parallel between the first and second electrodes T1
and T2 of the triac Q. A series circuit consisting of
an AC power source E and a load Z is connected between
the power source terminals P1 and P2.In the above construction, an input signal is
applied between the input terminals I1 and I2. The
photo sensing element J receives the light from the
light emitting element L and is made operative. The
photo sensing element J applies a trigger signal to the
triac Q. Due to the activation of the triac Q, a
current is supplied to the load Z through the triac Q.Next, when the supply of the input signal is
stopped and the light emitting element L is lit off,
the photo sensing element J is made inoperative. No
trigger signal is applied to the triac Q. The triac Q
is turned off at the zero-cross point of a power 
source voltage, thereby stopping the current supply to
the load Z.In this manner, the on/off switching operation
of the load current is performed by the triac Q in a
contactless manner.However, during the current supply to the
load Z, if the portion between the power source
terminals P1 and P2 is short-circuited due to an
unexpected accident, an abnormal current flows
