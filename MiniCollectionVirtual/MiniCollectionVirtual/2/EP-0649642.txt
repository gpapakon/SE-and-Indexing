<ABSTRACT>
The construction kit comprises a distal shaft member (2) and a neck member (3) which can be equipped with a joint head (10) and is supported on the shaft member (2) via approximately rectangular support surfaces (2c and 3c, respectively) arranged transversely relative to the longitudinal axis (L) of the shaft member (2). The shaft member (2) and the neck member (3) are designed with prismatic guide surfaces (2d and 3d, respectively) that are oriented in parallel with the longitudinal axis (L) and approach each other to form a form fit, and they are connected rigidly to one another via a reduced shaft screw (11) that can be elastically pretensioned corresponding to a predetermined bending moment to be absorbed. The guide surfaces (2d and 3d) are each formed on a peg-like extension (2b) of the shaft member (2) or on a corresponding recess (3b) of the neck member (3). This design permits positive centering and exact positioning of the neck member (3) on the shaft member (2) by the guide surfaces (2d, 3d) and non-positive coupling, independently thereof, between the neck member (3) and the shaft member (2) via the support surfaces (2c, 3c) which can be braced relative to one another by the pretensioning force of the reduced shaft screw (11).

Construction kit for a modular femur head prosthesis, in particular
a reoperation prosthesis, including a distal shaft part (2)

which can be anchored in a femur bone (1) and a neck part (3)
which can be equipped with an artificial joint ball (10) and which

can be fixed by means of a screw connection to the proximal end
portion (2a) of the shaft part (2), wherein the proximal end portion

(2a) of the shaft part (2) and of the neck part (3) are provided with
supporting surfaces (2c and 3c respectively) which can be braced

against one another and are positioned transverse to the longitudinal
axis (L) of the shaft part (2), and also with guide surfaces (2d

and 3d respectively) orientated in the direction of the longitudinal
axis (L) which can be brought together in a form-fitted manner;

and wherein the screw connection includes an extensible shaft
screw (11) which can be elastically prestressed with a predetermined

bias force, characterised in that the extensible shaft screw
(11) is provided with two cylindrical fitted surfaces formed at locally

thickened guide sections (13b and 13d; 13e and 13f) of the
screw shaft (13; 13') which are separated from one another by an

extensible section (13c) of the screw shaft (13; 13') formed with a
smaller cross-section than the guide sections (13b and 13d; 13e

and 13f) and which are intended to cooperate with two corresponding
centering surfaces formed in bores (14, 15) of the neck

part (3) and of shaft part (2), with one of the centering surfaces
being formed in a bore section (14d; 15b) fully arranged in one of

the two parts, neck part (3) or shaft part (2), and with the other
centering surface being formed in bore sections (14b, 15b), which

are arranged in both parts - neck part (3) and shaft part (2) - and 
indeed in adjoining bore sections (14b, 15b) in the proximal end

portion (2a) of the shaft part (2) and in the adjoining portion of the
neck part (3).
Construction kit according to claim 1, including a spigot-like
projection formed on the proximal end portion (2a) of the shaft

part (2) and a recess (3b) defined to receive this projection (2b)
formed on the neck part (3), with the guide surfaces (2d, 3d)

which can be brought together being respectively formed on the
projection (2b) of the shaft part (2) and in the recess (3b) of the

neck part (3).
Construction kit according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the proximal end portion (2a) of the shaft part (2) and at least one

connecting portion (3a) of the neck part (3) mountable thereon are
each executed with an at least approximately rectangular cross-section

the greater length dimension (A) of which extends substantially
in the lateral direction of the femur (1).
Construction kit according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that
the projection (2b) of the shaft part (2) and the recess (3b) in the

neck part which receives the projection are executed with an at
least approximately rectangular cross-section.
Construction kit according to one of the preceding claims, characterised
by at least one filling body (17, 18) as a replacement for

a missing piece of bone and mountable laterally of and/or posterior
to and/or anterior to a side wall of the neck part (3) and fixable

to the neck part (3). 
Construction kit according to claim 5, characterised in that the
neck part (3), or the filling body (17, 18), is provided with at least

one rail-like guide section (16), e.g. formed in the shape of a dove-tail,
and extending substantially in the direction of the longitudinal

axis (L) of the shaft part (2), and in that the filling body (17, 18), or
the neck part (3) respectively, is provided with a corresponding

groove-like guideway (21).
Construction kit according to claim 5 or claim 6, characterised in
that the filling body (17, 18) is provided with a collar portion (20) to

be mounted substantially in the direction of the longitudinal axis
(L) of the shaft part (2) over a proximal end portion of the neck part

(3).
Construction kit according to claim 7, characterised in that the
neck part (3) is provided in its proximal end portion with a recess

(9) intended to receive the head (12) of the extensible shaft screw
(11) and/or at least a part of the collar portion (20) of the filling

body (17, 18); and in that a cover element (22) covering this recess
(9) is provided and can be clamped against the collar portion (20).
Femur head prosthesis from a construction kit according to one of
the preceding claims.
