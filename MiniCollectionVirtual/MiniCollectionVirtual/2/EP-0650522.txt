<ABSTRACT>
The cloning and characterization of a new binding protein class, cyclophilin C (cyp C) and homologous proteins, is provided which is capable of binding to, e.g., the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA). The pattern of cyp C mRNA expression differs from that of cyp A mRNA expression, with cyp C being expressed in a more restricted subset of tissues, including those tissues reported to be most affected by CsA therapy. A fusion protein containing, e.g., amino acids 16-212 of cyp C has peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase activity (PPIase), and CsA inhibits this activity. Most significantly, these cyp C fusion proteins can be used as ligands for the identification of intracellular proteins which together form high affinity associations. For example, the cyp C fusion protein binds specifically to a protein of 77 Kd in the absence of CsA, while in the presence of CsA it no longer binds to this p77, but instead binds specifically to a protein 55 Kd, identified as calcineurin (see U.S.S.N. 07/740,175, incorporated herein by reference).

<DESCRIPTION>
 NOVEL CYCLOPHILINS, ASSOCIATING PROTEINS AND USES This invention was made in the course of work supported by the U.S. Government, which has certain rights in this invention.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA) is an undecapeptide fungal product which has a highly specific inhibitory effect on T cell activation or differentiation in vivo and in vitro. While CsA is currently widely used to prevent allograft rejection, its utility as a therapeutic agent is also being explored in a variety of autoimmune and neoplastic conditions. The discovery and purification (Handschumacher, 1984) and ultimately the cloning of the gene encoding the most abundant intracellular receptor for CsA, cyclophilin (Haendler, 1987) , promised to shed light on the mechanism of T cell inhibition by CsA.The subsequent discovery that cyclophilin possessed an intrinsic enzymatic activity, peptidyl- prolyl isomerase (PPIase) (Fischer, 1989; Takahashi, 1989) , and that this enzymatic activity was blocked byCsA, provided the outline for a possible explanation for the immunosuppressive action of CsA. This approach was supported by results from another immunosuppressive drug- receptor system when the receptor for FK506, the FK binding protein (FKBP) , was found also to possess PPIase activity (Harding, 1989; Siekierka, 1989) that was inhibited by FK506 (U.S.S.N. 07/740,175, filed 5 August 1991 and incorporated herein by reference) . However,- this proposal suffered on two counts: (1) cyclophilin is expressed ubiquitously, but its main actions in vivo are highly tissue restricted; and (2) CsA congeners reveal a dissociation between inhibition of PPIase activity and immunosuppressive potency (Sigal, 1991) . 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe cloning of a third mammalian cyclophilin, cyp C, isolated from a cDNA library prepared from the urine bone marrow derived stromal cell line AC 6 (Whitlock, 1987) , is provided. This cDNA was isolated from a subtracted sub-library containing genes induced by treatment of the stromal cell line with interleukin-1 (IL-1) . The message levels for cyp C show a 2-3 fold induction by treatment with IL-1, and this cDNA exhibits a high level of ho ology with known cyclophilins.Cyp C is a mediator for the immunosuppressive and nephrotoxic actions of CsA, as it is expressed most highly in the kidney, and can be detected in activated T cells as well as in the bone marrow stromal line AC 6. Cyp C can also be used as an affinity probe for cytoplasmic proteins involved in its functions
