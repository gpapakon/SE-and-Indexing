<ABSTRACT>
In order to decrease outlay for controlling the switching elements (switches) (T1, T2A, T2B) of a step-up/step-down voltage converter only one regulating arrangement is used, instead of separate regulating arrangements, for stepping down or stepping up an input voltage (Uin) to give a predetermined output voltage (Uout), and a necessary second control voltage (Upwm2) for controlling a part of the switching elements (T1, T2A, T2B) being derived from this single regulating arrangement by simple means.

Circuit arrangement for driving the switching 
elements of a step-up/step-down voltage transformer 

having a first switching element (T1) in a longitudinal. 
branch for step-down transformation of an input voltage 

(Uin) and two second switching elements (T2A, T2B) in a 
respective transverse branch for step-up transformation 

of the input voltage (Uin), of which the first switching 
element (T1) is connected via an associated control input 

for receiving a first control voltage (Upwm1) to a 
control-voltage generator circuit which has a regulating-voltage 

generator circuit for generating a regulating 
voltage (Uerr) and an oscillator (OSZ) for generating an 

oscillator voltage (Uosz), of which the regulating-voltage 
generator circuit and the oscillator (OSZ) are 

connected to a first pulse-width modulator (PWM1) for 
generating the first control voltage (Upwm1) from the 

regulating voltage (Uerr) and from the oscillator voltage 
(Uosz),
 
characterized 


in that a second pulse-width modulator (PWM2) is provided, 
which is connected by a first input for receiving 

the regulating voltage (Uerr) to the regulating-voltage 
generator circuit and by a second input, via an interposed 

voltage-increase circuit (Uc), to the oscillator 
(OSZ) in order to receive the oscillator voltage (Uosz) 

which is increased by a predetermined amount by the 
voltage-increase circuit (Uc), and 
in that the second pulse-width modulator (PWM2) has an 
output for a second control voltage (Upwm2), which is  

 
connected to a logic circuit consisting of first and 

second circuit parts, of which the first circuit part is 
connected to the first control voltage (Upwm1) and has 

two push-pull outputs, each for one intermediate control 
signal, which are each connected to an OR circuit (OD1, 

OD2) of the second circuit part, of which each OR circuit 
(OD1, OD2) is connected, in parallel with the respective 

connection to one of the outputs of the first circuit 
part, to the output of the second pulse-width modulator 

(PWM2) and respectively has one output which is in each 
case connected to a control input of one of the two 

second switching elements (T2A, T2B). 
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1,
 
characterized
 
in that the voltage-increase circuit (Uc) is designed 

such that the oscillator voltage (Uosz) is increased to 
an extent which corresponds to the peak-to-peak value of 

the oscillator voltage (Uosz). 
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1,
 
characterized
 
in that the voltage-increase circuit (Uc) is designed 

such that the oscillator voltage (Uosz) is increased to 
an extent which corresponds to a value below the peak-to-peak 

value of the oscillator voltage (Uosz).
