A process for the production of hydrophilicized 
triglycerides, characterized in that saturated, unsaturated 

and/or blown triglycerides corresponding to formula (I): 

 
in which R¹CO, R²CO and R³CO independently of one another 

represent optionally hydroxy-substituted acyl radicals 
containing 6 to 24 carbon atoms and 0 or 1 to 5 double 

bonds, 

a) are reacted with ethylene oxide in the presence of 
glycerol and alkaline catalysts, 
b) the resulting ethoxylated triglycerides are sulfonated 
with gaseous sulfur trioxide and 
c) the resulting acidic sulfonation products are subsequently 
neutralized with aqueous bases. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
triglycerides corresponding to formula (I), in which R¹CO, 

R²CO and R³CO independently of one another represent acyl 
radicals containing 16 to 18 carbon atoms and 0, 1 or 2 

double bonds, are used. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that unsaturated triglycerides with iodine values of 7 

to 180 are used. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that alkali metal hydroxides, alkaline  

 
earth metal hydroxides and/or alkali metal C₁₋₄ alcoholates 

are used as the alkaline ethoxylation catalysts. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the ethoxylation is carried out 

in the presence of 0.1 to 2% by weight, based on triglyceride, 
of the alkaline catalysts. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that the ethoxylation is carried out 

in the presence of 0.5 to 5% by weight, based on triglyceride, 
of glycerol. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the unsaturated triglycerides and 

the ethylene oxide are used in a molar ratio of 1:0.8 to 
1:50. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that the ethoxylation is carried out 

at temperatures of 150 to 180°C under autogenous pressures 
of 1 to 5 bar. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
8, characterized in that the ethoxylated triglycerides and 

the sulfur trioxide are used in a molar ratio of 1:0.3 to 
1:3.0. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
9, characterized in that the sulfonation is carried out at 

temperatures of 30 to 90°C. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
10, characterized in that the sulfonation is carried out 

continuously in a reactor operating on the falling film 
principle. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
11, characterized in that the neutralization is carried out 

with 5 to 55% by weight aqueous bases from the group 
consisting of alkali metal hydroxides, alkaline earth metal 

oxides and hydroxides, ammonia, mono-, di- and tri-C₂₋₄-alkanolamines 
and also primary, secondary and tertiary C₁₋₄  

alkylamines. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
12, characterized in that the pH value is kept at 6.5 to 

8.5 during the neutralization step. 
The use of the hydrophilicized triglycerides produced 
by the process claimed in claims 1 to 13 in laundry detergents, 

dishwashing detergents and cleaning products and 
also in hair-care and personal hygiene products.
