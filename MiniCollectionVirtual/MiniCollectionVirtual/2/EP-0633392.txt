<ABSTRACT>
Blade with variable curvature in which an elastic joint (3) is inserted into a space formed between the leading edge (1) and the trailing edge (2), which edges are articulated relative to one another. This elastic joint ensures continuity of the pressure face (5) and suction face (9) of the blade and allows a steady flow of fluid along the blade. The blade can also include means (21) and (23) for the circulation of a cooling fluid or heating fluid respectively through the leading edge (1) and the trailing edge (2), as well as a plurality of ducts (27) in the elastic joint (3), the said ducts placing the said fluid-circulation means (21) and (23) in communication.

<CLAIMS>
Variable-camber turbomachine blade having a
leading edge (1) and a trailing edge (2) which are

pivoted one with respect to the other in the direction of
the height of the blade about a geometrical pivot axis

(4), the said blade having a pressure face (5) defined by
a lateral surface (6) of the leading edge (1) and a

lateral surface (8) of the trailing edge (2), the said
blade also having a suction face (9) defined by the other

lateral surface (10) of the leading edge (1) and the
other lateral surface (12) of the trailing edge (2), the

said blade having, between the leading edge (1) and the
trailing edge (2), a space inside which is placed a

junction (3) made of an elastic material, the said
junction (3) being fastened on one side to the leading

edge (1) and on the opposite side to the trailing edge
(2), characterized in that the junction (3) is made of

one piece and has a lateral surface (7) continuous with
the lateral surfaces (6) and (8) which define the

pressure face (5), and a lateral surface (11) continuous
with the lateral surfaces (10) and (12) which define the

suction face.
Variable-camber turbomachine blade according to
Claim 1, characterized in that the elastic junction (3)

fills the space between the leading edge (1) and the
trailing edge (2).
Variable-camber turbomachine blade according to
Claim 2, characterized in that the bond between the

elastic junction (3) and, respectively, the leading edge
(1) and the trailing edge (2) is an adhesive bond. 
Variable-camber turbomachine blade according to
any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the

junction (3) is made of an elastomer having an ISO/Shore
hardness of between 40 and 70.
Variable-camber turbomachine blade according to
any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the

junction (3) includes a plurality of ducts (27) emerging
via one end in a cavity (21A) of the leading edge (1) and

via its other end in a cavity (23A) of the trailing edge
(2).
Variable-camber turbomachine blade according to
Claim 5, characterized in that the ducts (27) have a

sheath (32) in order to prevent them from being crushed.
