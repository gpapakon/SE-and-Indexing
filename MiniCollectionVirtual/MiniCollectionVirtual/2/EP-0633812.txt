<ABSTRACT>
An improved process is provided for the manufacture of a catalytically-active carbonaceous char capable of rapidly decomposing hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solutions. The process of the invention uses a low temperature carbonization and extensive oxidation of a bituminous coal or bituminous coal-like material followed by exposure to a nitrogen-containing compound at high temperatures during the initial calcination and/or activation. The resultant catalytically-active chars have the ability to rapidly decompose aqueous solutions of hydrogen peroxide and are useful for catalytic conversion of H2S, SOx, NOx, chloramines, and/or peroxides in liquid and/or gaseous streams. The catalytic activity of the char can be measured by adding the char to an apparatus (10) comprising a Dewar container (11) positioned on a magnetic stirrer (12) including a stir bar (13), a cap (14), a funnel (15), a vent (16), an opening (17), a thermocouple (18), an ice point compensator (21) and a strip char recorder (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalytically-active
carbonaceous char prepared from a bituminous coal or a bituminous coal-like material, a process for the
manufacture thereof, and the use thereof to decompose and remove peroxides from liquid media.Carbonaceous chars which are capable of functioning as catalysts per se are well known.
The presence of charcoal has been known to enhance a variety of oxidation reactions, including the
oxidation of hydrogen sulfide and SO2. In those instances where a carbonaceous char has been
observed to affect such reactions, it has functioned generally as a true catalyst, i.e. it affects only
the rate of a given reaction but is not itself changed by the reaction to any significant degree.Carbonaceous chars prepared from nitrogen-rich starting materials have been known to be
much more effective in catalyzing certain reactions, such as hydrogen peroxide decomposition, than
those prepared from nitrogen-poor feedstocks. Similarly, enhanced catalytic properties are known
to be imparted into chars prepared from nitrogen-poor starting materials by exposing such chars to
nitrogen-containing compounds such as ammonia at high temperatures. More recently, catalytically-active
chars have been prepared by the calcination or calcination/activation of low- or high-temperature
chars prepared from nitrogen-rich materials such as polyacrylonitrile and polyamide.
Catalytically-active chars also have been prepated from nitrogen-poor starting materials by the
calcination of high-temperature chars in the presence of nitrogen-containing compounds such as
ammonia. In all cases, high-temperature carbonaceous chars are those produced by thermal
treatment at temperatures greater than 700°C. Low temperature carbonaceous chars have not been
subjected to temperatures greater than 700°C.Advantages have been found in oxidizing the high-temperature char prepared from nitrogen-poor
feedstocks prior to or during exposure to nitrogen-containing compounds. Similarly, oxidizing 
a low-temperature char prepared from nitrogen-rich feedstocks such as polyacrylonitrile has been
found to enhance the catalytic activity.However, all of the prior art processes for preparing carbonaceous chars which are
catalytically active per se have certain disadvantages which limit their overall utility and practicality.
For example, nitrogen-rich starting materials, such as polyacrylonitrile or polyamide, are expensive
and have been found to generate large amounts of cyanide and other toxic gases upon carbonization.
