<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of a bitumen-polymer composition by mixing bitumen and polymer at a temperature of between 190 and 300 DEG C, more particularly between 220 and 260 DEG C, for a period preferably longer than 30 minutes. According to the invention, preliminary tests are used to determine the aromaticity contents of the mixture, which are associated with a Fraass point of the final composition which is equal to or lower than -13 DEG C and with a storage stability of this composition, defined by its ring-and-ball  DELTA , which is equal to or lower than 5 DEG C. Before performing the mixing of the bitumen and of the polymer and/or during this mixing, the aromaticity content of the mixture is adjusted to bring it into the said range by adding at least one aromatic compound to the bitumen and/or to the polymer.

Method for the preparation of a bitumen-polymer 
composition by mixing the bitumen and the polymer at a 

temperature lying between 190 and 300°C, more particularly 
between 220 and 260°C, for a period of time preferably 

longer than 30 minutes, characterised in that preliminary 
tests are used to determine the range of aromaticities of 

the mixture associated with a Fraass point of the final 
composition equal to or below -13°C and with a stability 

during storage of this composition, defined by its ring-and-ball 
test Δ, equal to or less than 5°C, and in that, 

before mixing the bitumen and the polymer and/or during 
this mixing, the degree of aromaticity of the mixture is 

adjusted in order to bring it within the said range by 
the addition of at least one aromatic compound to the 

bitumen and/or to the polymer. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the bitumen is a "natural" bitumen. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the bitumen is a "synthetic" bitumen. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the polymer is a polymer having 

hydrocarbon chains with mobile hydrogen and chosen from 
the group formed by natural or synthetic rubbers, like 

the statistical styrene-butadiene SBR copolymers 
(styrene-butadiene-rubber) or the block SBS copolymers 

(styrene-butadiene-styrene), with a linear or star 
structure, or SIS (styrene-isoprene-styrene). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that, in order to adjust the degree of 

aromaticity of the mixture, the bitumen and/or the 
polymer have added to them an aromatic extract obtained 

during the removal of aromatics from lubricating bases 
and/or a heavy aromatic fraction ("slurry") arising from 

a catalytic cracking process.
