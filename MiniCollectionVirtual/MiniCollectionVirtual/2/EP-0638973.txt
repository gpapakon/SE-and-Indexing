<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a spacing element for busbar protection conduits, busbars being made contact with from above, from the side or from below. The spacing element has inner wall parts for engaging around the associated busbar head regions like brackets. In addition, it has outer wall regions, which rest against the inner walls of the busbar protection conduit as well as end regions which run axially with respect to the busbar axis over which the free longitudinal edges of the busbar protection conduit engage in a latching manner. The invention is regarded as being that axially adjacent busbar protection conduits (10, 20, 30) are arranged on the spacing elements (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) with a defined separating gap from one another at their free ends (101, 301). The spacing elements (4, 5) assigned to the free ends (101, 301) of axially adjacent busbar protection conduits (10, 30) have a limiting stop (41, 51), for the busbar protection conduits (10, 30), on both sides. These limiting stops (41, 51) project into the separating gap between the free ends (101, 301) of adjacent busbar protection conduits (10, 30). An elongated, collar-like covering element (201, 102) engages over the free ends (101, 301) of two axially adjacent busbar protection conduits (10, 30), covering the gap.

<CLAIMS>
Live-rail protective casing for rails coated from the top, from the bottom or from 
the side, with spacers to encircle and retain the live-rail top sections, with outer 

faces resting against the inner faces of the live-rail protective casing and with end 
sections running along the live-rail axis and enclasped by the unattached 

longitudinal edges of the live-rail protective casing, characterised by the fact that 
the unattached ends (101, 201, 301) of the axially juxtaposed casings (10, 20, 30) 

are retained at a specified distance (S) on the spacers ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), that each of the 
spacers (4, 5) for the unattached ends (101, 301) of the axially juxtaposed live-rail 

protective casings (10, 30) is provided with a stop (41, 51) which projects up into 
the space (S) between the unattached ends (101, 301) of juxtaposed live-rail 

protective casings (10, 30) and only permits longitudinal expansion of the live-rail 
protective casing in a direction parallel to the axis, and characterised by the fact 

that the unattached ends (101, 201, 301) of two axially juxtaposed live-rail 
protective casings (10, 20, 30) are bridged by a collar type of cover element (102, 

201). 
Live-rail protective casing as in Claim 1 characterised by the fact that the collar 
type cover element (201, 102) is connected to the unattached end of only one of the 

two axially juxtaposed live-rail protective casings (20, 10). 
Live-rail protective casing as in Claim 2 characterised by the fact that the 
connection is made mechanically by rivets, screws or an adhesive. 
Live-rail protective casing as in Claim 1 characterised by the fact that the collar 
type cover element (201, 102) is formed by widening the unattached end of a live-rail 

protective casing (20, 10).
