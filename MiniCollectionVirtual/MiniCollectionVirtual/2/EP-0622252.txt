<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic tire has a belt reinforcing structure 
comprising a folded belt ply and a spirally wound structure 

extending transversely between the folded edges of folded 
portions of the folded belt ply. No cut belts are used in 

the assembly. In an illustrated embodiment, both the 
folded belt ply and the spirally wound ply are reinforced 

with aramid cords. Also, a plurality of spirally wound 
plies can be used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pneumatic tires 
comprising a radial ply carcass, a tread disposed radially 
outwardly of the crown region of the carcass, a belt 
assembly interposed between the tread portion and the crown 
region of the carcass in circumferential surrounding 
relation to the carcass. The invention relates more 
specifically to low aspect ratio tires. Belt assemblies including a folded ply are well known 
in the art. In one prior art embodiment the folded ply is 
reinforced with cords of high modulus material and has an 
overall width at least equal to that of the tread. Each of 
its lateral sides is folded back in a radially outward 
direction, around two unfolded - so-called single cut - 
plies. The reinforcing cords of the folded ply form an 
angle of 20 to 60 degrees, and those of the two single cut 
plies form opposed angles, respectively of 15 to 28 and -15 
to -28 degrees, all with respect to the equatorial plane of 
the tire. Tires comprising folded plies in their crown 
region have been found to be particularly durable when 
subjected to high revolution speeds. They have also 
improved resistance to separations at the axial edges of a 
belt assembly. EP-A-92 498 discloses a first tread reinforcing ply 
folded around a second tread reinforcing ply, such that the 
first ply envelops the second ply. The reinforcing cords 
of the first ply form an angle of 20 to 60 degrees and 
those of the second ply form an angle comprised of 0 to 10 
degrees with respect to the equatorial plane of the tire. LU 85 964 describes a tire having an overlay structure 
disposed radially outwardly of the belt assembly. Helical 
convolutions of a ribbon are wound axially across two  
 
single cut plies such that the convolutions are in 
abutting contact with each other. The ribbon is 
reinforced with cords of textile material. An overlay 
structure wherein the helical convolutions overlap is for 
instance disclosed in EP 333 628. Further tire crown 
reinforcements comprising folded plies and single cut 
plies together with a helically wound ribbon are 
disclosed in LU-A- 87789. Tires having such overlay 
structures in their crown region have excellent high 
speed properties but are expensive to manufacture. The present invention has an object to provide a 
pneumatic tire which is durable at high speeds. A further object is to provide a tire which has 
fewer components, less weight, and at the same time has a 
high degree of uniformity. Other objects of the invention will be apparent from 
the following

<CLAIMS>
A pneumatic tire (10) having an aspect ratio 
below 65, comprising at least one radial ply carcass 

(13,14), a tread (22) disposed radially outward of the 
crown region (20) of the carcass, a belt assembly (21) 

having an overall width substantially equal to the tread 
width (TW) interposed between the tread (22) and the 

crown region in circumferential surrounding relation to
