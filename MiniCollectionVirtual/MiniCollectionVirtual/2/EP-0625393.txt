<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a router for
carpentry with quick tool replacement as per the preamble of claim 1.
An example of such a router is disclosed in WO 81/02401A.In carpentry, particularly for the beadwork of panels,
wooden tiles and the like, vertical milling machines
(hereinafter simply termed "routers" for convenience in
description) are known to include a milling tool coupled to
the top of a vertical shaft that protrudes above a working
surface on which the part to be machined is moved.In conventional routers, every time a new profile must
be formed it is necessary to replace the old milling tool
with a new one. This leads to the need to use tools having
holes of the same diameter so that they can be fitted on
the same shaft, and this sets limits to the structure of
the tool.In other kinds of routers the tool is mounted on a
replaceable shaft in order to obviate this drawback.
Nonetheless, it is still necessary to remove the tool
before accessing the shaft. Furthermore, it has been found
that the means for fixing the shaft are difficult or at
least awkward to access.The technical aim of the present invention is to
provide a router that allows to overcome the shortcomings
of those currently commercially available and in particular
allows rapid tool mounting and removal operations and the
use of tools having different internal diameters.This aim is achieved with a router for carpentry
as in claim 1. Further characteristics and advantages of the router
according to the present invention will become apparent
from the following detailed description of a preferred
embodiment, illustrated only by way of non-limitative
example in the accompanying drawing, wherein:
the only figure is a vertical sectional view of a
router according to the new inventive concept.With reference to the above figure, the router
comprises a plate 1 on which a tubular post 2 is fixed;
said post rises vertically and a hollow shaft 5 is
rotatably supported inside it by means of bearings 3 and 4.A pulley 6 is keyed on the portion of the hollow shaft
5 that lies below the plate 1 and is driven, by means of a
belt which is not shown, by an electric motor mounted onto
said plate.The pulley 6 is rigidly coupled to the hollow shaft 5
by means of rings 7 and 8 having a wedge-like cross-section
and forced between the pulley and the hollow shaft by means
of a ring 9.The upper bearing 4 is protected by a labyrinth seal
formed by a first ring 10 which is fixed to the top of the 
post 2 and by a second ring 11 which is fixed to the top

<CLAIMS>
A router for carpentry comprising: a tubular post
(2) being supported on a base (1); a hollow shaft (5) which

is rotatably supported in said tubular post (2) and is
connected to rotational actuation elements, said hollow

shaft (5) having, at an end thereof, a conical seat (13) for
the coupling of the tapered tang (14) of a tool supporting

shaft (15); means (23, 24, 27) for retaining said tang (14)
in said seat (13); means (16,17,18) for providing the rotary coupling

between said hollow shaft (5) and said tool supporting shaft
(15); means (34) for releasing said tang (14) from said seat

(13) to allow the removal of said tool supporting shaft
(15); and a pin (26), fixed to an end of a stay bolt (27)

which is guided in a cylindrical seat cavity (12) crossing
said hollow shaft (5), adapted to abut on the free end of

said tang (14) for its expulsion from said seat (13)
following the release of the tang from said tang retaining

means (23, 24, 27), 
characterized in that
 the tubular post
(2) is vertical, whereby the hollow shaft (5) is connected

to the rotational actuation elements at the lower end
thereof and has the conical seat (13) at its top end and the

pin (26) is fixed to the top end of the stay bolt (27), 
and
in that
 it further comprises air supply channels (44, 45),
which axially cross said stay bolt (27) and a stem (36)

movable to abut on said stay bolt (27), said air channels
(44, 45) being mutually connected by lifting the stem (36)

for supplying compressed air at the conical seat (13),
during expulsion of said tang (14), for external venting of

the air which is indicative that a tool changing operation
is in course, and so as to keep clean said seat (13), and 

Two sensors (40, 41) provided to detect the axial position of
said stay bolt (27) and said stem (36) respectively whereby to indicate

imperfect penetration of a newly inserted tool tang (14) in
said seat (13).

characterized in that

said means for retaining said tang in said seat comprises the
stay bolt (27) which is slidingly accommodated in said 

hollow shaft (5) and is provided, at one end, with a collet
(24), elastic traction means (28) being provided which move

said bolt (27) from a position in which said collet is open,
in order to receive a stem (23) of said tang (14), toward a
