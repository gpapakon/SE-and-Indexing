<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic head driving apparatus is provided 
with a pair of switch elements for switching a 

direction of a current to be supplied to a magnetic 
head. ON/OFF operations of the pair of switch 

elements are controlled in correspondence with an 
information signal to be recorded so as to modulate 

a magnetic field generated by the magnetic head in 
accordance with the information signal. A 

predetermined time difference is provided between an 
ON operation of one switch element and an OFF 

operation of the other switch element of the pair of 
switch elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a driving
apparatus for a magnetic field modulation magnetic head
used in a magnetooptical recording apparatus adopting a
magnetic field modulation method.As a conventional recording method of a
magnetooptical recording apparatus, an optical
modulation method, a magnetic field modulation method,
and the like are known. In particular, the magnetic
field modulation method is advantageous in terms of the
recording speed, and the like since it can directly
overwrite new data on old data. Fig. 1 shows the
schematic arrangement of a magnetooptical recording
apparatus adopting the magnetic field modulation
method. Referring to Fig. 1, a magnetooptical
recording layer 2 is formed on a magnetooptical disk 1.
A magnetic head 3 obtained by winding a main coil LH
around a magnetic core is arranged above the upper
surface of the magnetooptical disk 1, and an optical
head 4 is arranged below the lower surface thereof to
oppose the magnetic head 3. The optical head 4
radiates a laser beam emitted from a semiconductor
laser arranged therein as a light source as a very 
small beam spot on the recording layer 2 to increase
the temperature of a recording portion to a temperature
equal to or higher than the Curie temperature of the
recording layer 2. The magnetic head 3 is driven by a
driving circuit 5 to generate a bias magnetic field
which is modulated according to recording information,
and applies the bias magnetic field to the heated
portion of the recording layer 2. Then, the direction
of magnetization of the heated portion on the recording
layer 2 aligns in the direction of the bias magnetic
field. When the heated portion is cooled down upon
rotation of the magnetooptical disk 1, the direction of
magnetization is fixed, and an information pit in the
direction of magnetization corresponding to an
information signal is recorded on the recording layer
2.Recently, in order to record information at a
higher density, an information pit recording method is
transitting from pit position recording which provides
the significance of information at the central position
of a pit to pit edge recording which provides the
significance of information to the edge position of a
pit. In this pit edge recording, the edge of an
information pit must be clearly recorded, and for this
purpose, it is required to achieve a high reversal
speed of the bias magnetic field by the magnetic head
in recording. As first example of a driving apparatus of the
magnetic head, which can satisfy such a requirement, an
