<ABSTRACT>
A current transformer device (10) is formed on a ceramic 
substrate (12) which is provided with a plurality of planar conductive tracks (16) 

formed on a surface of the substrate (12) where the conductive tracks (16) 
extend substantially radially from an imaginary point on the surface of the 

substrate (12). A structure of permeable material (25) is then tape cast or 
epitaxially formed by vapor deposition of a thick film of magnetic ceramic over 

the major portion of each of the conductive tracks (16) to form a permeable 
toroidal core (22). A lead frame (38) is then placed over the core (22) and a 

plurality of metal conductors (26) are soldered to each of the respective 
exposed ends of the metal conductive tracks (16) on the substrate (12). The 

required electrical elements (54) to complete the current transformer device (10)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to inductors, and more specifically, 
to current transformers of the toroidal type suitable for utilization in hybrid 
integrated circuit environments. Traditionally, a ferrite or laminated or tape wound steel core is 
hand wound with a length of electrically conductive wire to provide an electrical 
inductor. The inductors can then be mounted to a support structure such as 
a printed circuit board or a ceramic substrate using a boarding resin or the coil 
leads, which can also consist of coil taps, can be soldered to the support 
structure which then provide support to the inductor. It has been found to be quite difficult to use inductors fabricated 
using this method in hybrid integrated circuit assemblies. The bulk inherent in 
such inductors created by the wire, the large wire lead location tolerances 
required, and the difficulty in connecting the wire leads to the circuit board 
result in high manufacturing cost and an unsatisfactory integrated circuit 
package. The prior art has suggested many technologies for overcoming 
the difficulties encountered when inductances are to be incorporated in solid 
state circuit devices. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,305,814 granted to Moyer; 
U.S. Patent No. 3,659,240 granted to Learned; and U.S. Patent No. 3,858,138 
granted to Gittleman et al, the disclosures of which are hereby expressly 
incorporated by reference, each disclose the use of deposition techniques to 
derive appropriate inductances using multiple layers of magnetic material. 
Using these prior art deposition techniques, the power handling capability is 
quite limited and will not provide the necessary inductance or power handling 
capabilities required for many integrated circuit applications. The prior art also discloses various methods of forming the wire 
looping over the permeable core to form a toroidal or non-toroidal inductor  
 
structure. U.S. Patent No. 4,103,267 entitled "Hybrid Transformer Device", the 
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, describes a ceramic 
substrate having a plurality of planar conductors which are formed of metallized 
strips on ceramic substrate. A dielectric glass material is formed over the 
conductors leaving only the exposed ends of the conductors available for 
connection to an electric circuit such as a wire looping a ferrite core. A sintered 
one piece ferrite toroidal core is precoated with insulating material and is 
adhesively secured to the dielectric layer. A plurality of wire conductors are 
wire
