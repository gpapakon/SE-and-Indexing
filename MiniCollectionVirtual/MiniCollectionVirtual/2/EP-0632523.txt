<ABSTRACT>
A planar antenna is disclosed. The antenna (1) has an array of coaxial ring-slot 
radiating elements (4,5) formed through a conductive layer (3) on a dielectric 

substrate (2). A number of probes (14,15), coupled to the ring-slot element (4,5), 
excite a resonant mode on each ring-slot element (4,5). The resonant modes combine 

in the far field to form a directional radiation pattern. By adjustment of the relative 
phase difference between the excited modes, the radiation pattern can be steered in 

azimuth. The phase difference can be controlled by electronic phase shifting means 
(12,13). The radiation pattern also can be shaped in elevation by choice of the ring-slot 

element (4,5) geometry to support desired resonant modes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a steerable planar antenna according to the preamble of Claim 1
having directional azimuthal and elevation radiation patterns
that can be modified. Such an antenna is disclosed in CA-A-1 305 249.The preferred embodiment of the antenna described finds particular application
in a wireless local area network (WLAN) operating at 30 - 300 GHz, and preferably at
approximately 60 GHz. Such an antenna plays an important part in communications
between portable computing devices and/or peripherals and the remainder of a local
area network. It is desirable in such an application to have an antenna with a 'beam'
(radiation pattern) that can be steered in azimuth electronically. Alternatively, this
steering property can be used to form an adaptive antenna for use in environments
where there is an interfering signal, in which case the null's of the antenna beam can be
steered electronically to minimise the interference caused by a competing signal. It is
further desirable to be able to modify the beam pattern in elevation.It is the object of the present invention to produce such an antenna.According to one aspect of the present invention there is disclosed a 
steerable antenna comprising an electrically conductive layer on
a dielectric substrate, the conductive layer defining a plurality, L, of coaxial
ring-slot radiating elements formed therethrough, and controllable signal feed
means coupled to each said ring-slot element, said feed means exciting a
separate resonant mode on each of said ring-slot radiating elements, the mode
excited being dependant upon the geometry of the respective said ring-slot radiating
element, radiation due to said resonant modes combining by superposition in the
far-field to produce a radiation pattern directional in azimuth and elevation, and
wherein the feed means being controllable to adjust the relative phase between each
said resonant mode to steer the radiation pattern in azimuth, and characterised in that
said feed means selectively feeds K of said L radiating elements where K is in
the range of 1 to L, and is further controllable to adjust the relative amplitude of the
excited modes to steer said radiation pattern in elevation.   The invention further discloses a wireless local area network including a
plurality of planar antennas as described immediately above.In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, there is disclosed a
method of electronically steering the far-field radiation pattern of a
planar antenna in elevation and azimuth,
