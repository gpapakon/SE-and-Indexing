<ABSTRACT>
A door frame (10) having excellent fire-resistance, flexural strength and screw holding properties is fabricated from gypsum fiberboard, specifically a gypsum fiberboard having a density of at least 60 lbs./cu ft., a flexural strength of at least 30 lbs. (1/2" thick material), and a screw holding capability of at least about 400 lbs. A preferred gypsum fiberboard material for fabrication of the door frame (10) comprises a composition containing a substantially uniform dispersion of solids including by weight about 65 % to 90 % set gypsum, about 7 % to about 30 % pulped paper, up to about 9 % binder, and about 8 % to 2 % inorganic fiber. A wood veneer (28) is preferably applied to the visible faces of the gypsum fiberboard door frame members by means of adhesive (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to door frames and 
relates more particularly to door frames fabricated from a 
fire retardant material. Historically, door frames and doors were made of 
wood. Wood has the advantages of being easily worked in the 
field using hand tools, can be stained or painted to match 
other wood trim or panelling in a room, and has good screw 
holding ability, permitting the secure mounting of hinges, 
strike plates, knobs and latches as well as other hardware, 
such as door closing devices. One significant drawback of wood is its poor 
resistance to fire. With the increased emphasis on fire 
retarding properties of building materials, particularly 
commercial structures, as evidenced by modern building codes, 
wooden door frames are now utilized principally in residential 
construction. In addition to its failure to meet fire test 
standards, there are other disadvantages of wood for use as a 
door framing material. The supply of clear wood stock is 
limited and costs have risen as a result. Techniques have 
been developed to fabricate longer wood members from a 
plurality of short pieces of clear wood stock but these  
 
techniques introduce additional steps and equipment and hence 
higher costs. Other disadvantages of wood include its tendency to 
deform and even rot under moist circumstances, and it is 
subject to scarring from even minor impacts. Refinishing can 
also be troublesome, since scraping or sanding can, if not 
carefully controlled, deform the planar surfaces. In view of the above, and particularly due to 
building codes requiring fire retardant doors and door frames, 
steel has become the material of choice for door frames where 
fire retardant properties are required. Although steel door 
frames do readily pass the required fire and hose stream 
tests, they suffer from other shortcomings. Steel cannot be 
readily worked at the building site and hence even minor 
adjustments such as to a door frame height, for example, 
cannot be readily accomplished in the field. Furthermore, steel frames are typically 
prefabricated by welding, making handling difficult and taking 
up more shipping space than would be required if the frame 
members could be shipped in a knocked down condition. In 
addition, steel frames cannot be stained to match the 
remaining woodwork in a room and accordingly must either be 
painted or treated with applications which simulate a wood 
finish. Because of its typical thin sections, steel presents 
complications in attaching hardware, and
