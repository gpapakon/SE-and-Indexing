<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a crosslinker and a method of
cross-linking a coating binder polymer having at least two carboxylic acid groups.The process of film formation is fairly well understood in the coatings
industry and details on the process may be found in "Organic Film Formers" in
Paint and Surface Coatings, by J. Bentley (R. Lambourne (Editor), John Wiley and
Sons, New York, N.Y., 1987). In particular, in film formation technology, it is
known that the addition of a cross-linker to a film forming coating formulation
can improve certain important properties of the formed coating, such as its
hardness, solvent resistance and mar resistance. However, it is desirable to have
a cross-linking mechanism which is operative during or after film formation. If
the cross-linking mechanism has proceeded materially before film formation has
been substantially completed, the overall film formation process will be
compromised and the resultant film will be weak and porous with the result that
the protective functions of the film will be severely impaired. In some
applications heat may be used to assist cross-linking after film formation is
complete. However, in many cases, heat is not available so the cross-linking
mechanism is desirably triggered under ambient conditions before film
formation is complete.An example of a known good performance cross-linker for coating
formulations is a product sold under the trade name of XAMA-7 (supplied by EIT
Inc). XAMA-7 essentially consists of three connected aziridine groups. While
XAMA-7 displays good cross-linking performance it does suffer from an
important draw back. It is very toxic. It therefore has to be handled with the
utmost of care. This is clearly undesirable.However, not all commercial cross-linkers are as toxic as the aziridine
based products. For example, carbodiimides having the general structural 
formula of r-N=C=N-r', wherein at least r' is an aliphatic group, have been
used as cross-linkers. In this regard, US-A-4977219, EP-A-0277361 and EP-A-0241805
disclose aliphatic polycarbodiimide cross-linkers, wherein both r
and r' are aliphatic groups. EP-A-0277361 discloses a mixed aliphatic and
aromatic polycarbodiimide cross-linker, wherein r is an aromatic group and r'
is an aliphatic group. Even though these aliphatic polycarbodiimide cross-linkers
are used commercially, they do suffer from certain draw backs. In
particular, cross-linking is too facile with the result that the cross-linking
mechanism is substantially completed before film formation is
