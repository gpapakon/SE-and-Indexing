<ABSTRACT>
An undercarriage, particularly for stretchers, which has multi-height adjustment and does not need to be manually raised or lowered by the attendant when being loaded into, or unloaded from, an ambulance. The undercarriage includes a rectangular support structure (10), a wheeled height adjustable framework (11) having first and second pairs of collapsible legs (23, 24; 31, 32) and height actuating means. The height actuating means comprises one or more ties (46, 47) connected to the first and second pairs of legs and to the support structure which are retractable or extendable so as to extend or collapse the first and second pairs of legs to thereby adjust the height of the support structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to equipment for
transporting people, animals, goods and materials, and
other such objects, and is particularly concerned with a
height adjustable wheeled undercarriage to which a
stretcher, pallet, or like platform can be fitted. The
invention has been primarily devised for the purpose of
transporting patients and will therefore be described in
this context, however its broader ramifications for use
as a general transport undercarriage should be borne in
mind and the following description is not to be taken as
limiting the scope of the invention in any manner
whatsoever.Patient transporting equipment such as
ambulance cots, are available in a wide range of designs
and models. Most, however are not adjustable in height
and those that are are restricted to a specific number of
heights to which they can be set such as the one
disclosed in WO 88/01857. The setting of such heights
usually involves a series of operations involving
manipulating pins and/or levers, and is time consuming
and, in many cases, awkward.A further disadvantage of existing ambulance
cots is that they are not readily adaptable to loading
into different makes or models of ambulances which vary
from one to another in the heights of their loading
platforms. To accommodate differing heights, the cot
must usually either be tilted or, if adaptable to a range
of specific heights, must be readjusted in height with
locating pins to correspond with the particular height of
the ambulance. More often than not, such height
adjustment cannot be sufficiently fine tuned with the
result that the cot must still be tilted to some degree
to enable loading. Such operations are not only time
consuming and inconvenient to the patient, but also place
strains on the ambulance attendant. A still further disadvantage of existing
ambulance cots is that although they may be designed to
suit a particular height of ambulance loading platform,
they usually cannot readily adapt to the gradual changes
in height which commonly occur over time as the ambulance
ages. This will result in increasing strain being placed
on the ambulance attendant as he is forced to take the
weight of the cot as it is being loaded or unloaded.It is therefore an object of the present
invention to provide patient transporting equipment which
obviates or at least minimises the aforementioned
disadvantages.One aspect of the present invention provides an
undercarriage comprising a support structure fitted to a
height adjustable framework consisting of first and
second pairs
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An undercarriage comprising a support structure
(10) fitted to a height adjustable framework (11)

consisting of first and second pairs of collapsible legs
(23, 24; 31, 32), and an actuating means (12) for

adjusting the height of the support structure (10),
characterised in that the actuating means (12) comprises

first and second flexible ties (46, 47) respectively
connected to the first and second pairs of collapsible

legs (23, 24; 31, 32) and to the support structure (10)
through the intermediary of first and second spools (60)

onto which said first and second flexible ties (46, 47)
are respectively retractable, which first and second

flexible ties (46, 47) are retractable or extendable so
as to extend or collapse the first and second pairs of

legs (23, 24; 31, 32) to thereby adjust the height of the
support structure (10), and wherein each said spool (60)

is under spring tension so that the associated flexible
tie (46) is biased to wind onto that spool (60) each said

spool (60) having an associated ratchet mechanism (61) to
enable its associated flexible tie (46) to be unwound

from its spool (60) when the associated ratchet mechanism
(61) is disengaged so that the support structure (10) can

be lowered.
An undercarriage as claimed in claim 1, wherein
the height of the support structure (10) is infinitely

adjustable between the fully collapsed and fully extended
position of the first and second pairs of collapsible

legs (23, 24; 31, 32).
An undercarriage as claimed in claim 2, wherein
the maximum height to which the support structure (10) is

raised is adjustable by stop means (70) which control the
amount by which the flexible tie (46) is retracted.
An undercarriage as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said first and second flexible ties (46, 47) are

respectively connected to the first and second pairs of
collapsible legs (23, 24; 31, 32) through the

intermediary of first and second cross-bars (35, 48). 
An undercarriage as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said first and second flexible ties (46, 47) are belts.
An undercarriage as claimed in claim 3, wherein
said stop means (70) is interposed between the first or

second pairs of collapsible legs (23, 24; 31, 32) and is
manually relocatable between an infinite number of fixed

positions to thereby control the amount by which the
flexible tie (46) is retracted.
An undercarriage as claimed in claim 1, in
which the support structure (10) is adapted to carry a

patient stretcher.
An undercarriage as claimed in claim 1,
wherein said support structure

(10) comprises two substantially parallel spaced beams
(13, 14) interconnected by connector members, (15, 16)

and wherein said first and second pairs of collapsible
legs (23, 24; 31, 32) are angled downwardly from

intermediate regions of each of said beams (13, 14), said
first pair of legs (23, 24) being interconnected and

pivotally joined to fixed points on said respective beams
(13, 14) and said second pair of legs (31, 32) being

interconnected and pivotally joined to a first cross-bar
(35) extending between said beams (13, 14), which first

cross-bar (35) is slidable with respect to two shafts
(37) one each of which extends adjacent and parallel to

one of each said beams (13, 14), there being provided a
pair of first linkages (38, 39) which each pivotally 

connect an intermediate portion of each one of said first
pair of legs (23, 24) to a second cross-bar (48) slidable

with respect to said shafts and a pair of second linkages
(41,42) which pivotally connect an intermediate portion

of each one of said second pair of legs (31, 32) to a
fixed point on the respective beams (13,14).
An undercarriage as claimed in claim 8, wherein
said first and second pairs of legs (23, 24; 31, 32) are

fitted with ground wheels (25, 26; 33, 34) at their
extremities and the support structure (10) is adapted to

carry a stretcher
