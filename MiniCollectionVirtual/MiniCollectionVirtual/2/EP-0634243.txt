<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to electrode 
tubes for electrical discharge machining and manufacturing 
methods thereof, and more specifically, to improvements in 
an electrode tube for electrical discharge machining 
having substantially a plurality of through holes and a 
method of manufacturing such an electron tube. 
Description of the Related Art When small holes are formed in a metal or alloy 
workpiece by means of electrical discharge machining, an 
electrode is used which is formed of a copper tube having 
an outer diameter for example in the range from 0.3 to 
3.0mm. A working fluid for cooling is passed through 
through holes of the electrode tube, electrical discharge 
is caused between the electrode tube and the workpiece 
while turning the electrode tube, and the workpiece is 
thus perforated. However, as illustrated in a cross section in Fig. 8, 
an undesired core 7 forms inside electrode tube 1 during 
electrical discharge machining of workpiece 6. Core 7 
lowers the precision of electrical discharge machining,  
 
impedes smooth electrical discharge machining operation 
and lowers working efficiency as a result. In order to solve such a problem, electrode tubes 
shown in Figs. 9 to 11 have been suggested (see Japanese 
Patent Laying-Open No. 63-11239). Electrode tube 1 in Fig. 9 includes a cylindrical 
metal tube 2 and a metal partition 8 inserted in 
cylindrical portion 2. Electrode tube 1 illustrated in Fig 10 includes 
cylindrical metal tube 2 and two metal rods 9 inserted in 
cylindrical portion 2. Electrode tube 1 shown in Fig. 11 includes a 
cylindrical metal tube 2 and two inner metal tubes 10 
inserted in cylindrical portion 2. In electrode tubes 1 shown in Figs. 9 to 11, the 
space in cylindrical portion 2 is divided into a plurality 
of through holes. Therefore, if electrical discharge 
machining is conducted while turning electrode 1, an 
undesired core does not form in electrode tube 1. In the manufacture of electrode tubes as illustrated 
in Figs. 9 to 11, a partitioning plate, thin rods, or 
inner tubes are inserted in tube 2 and then drawing 
working must be conducted. A tube material wound in a 
long coil cannot be used if such a partitioning plate, 
thin rods or thin inner tubes are inserted in tube 2.  
 Tube material 2 to which the partitioning plate, thin rods 
or thin inner tubes are inserted must be relatively short 
and straight. Therefore, the electrode tubes as shown in 
Figs. 9 to 11 cannot be continuously produced from long 
tube material 2 wound in a
