<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording medium is made by applying a 
coating mixture having magnetic particles dispersed in a 

binder and drying the coating mixture so as to produce a 
coding layer containing tamper-proof identifier coding 

information comprising designed patterns, letters, 
numerals and bar-code type patterns. Another magnetic 

layer for recording regular magnetic data can be provided 
above or below the coding layer. The coding information 

can neither be read or altered by ordinary magnetic 
reader. The magnetic recording medium is therefore 

useful for such applications as shopping cards, pre-paid 
cards, retail store cards; financial cards including 

credit cards, insurance cards; travelling cards including 
transit passes, tickets; and identification cards 

including passports, birth certificates and other 
personal identification cards. A method of making such a 

magnetic recording medium is also presented in which the 
coating mixture is applied on a non-magnetic base 

material, and while the coating mixture is still wet, 
i.e. while the magnetic particles are mobile, suitable 

coding information is magnetically recorded. The coating 
mixture is then dried to fixate the identifier coding 

information in the coding layer to produce fixated coding 
information which is non-erasable and non-alterable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic
recording medium for use in magnetic cards, magnetic
sheets and magnetic roll papers for such applications as
shopping cards including pre-paid cards, retail store
cards; financial cards including credit cards, insurance
cards; travelling cards including transit passes,
tickets; and identification cards including passports,
birth certificates and other personal identification
cards.The fields of application of consumer cards
containing magnetically recorded information have
expanded rapidly in recent years, and the uses of such
cards are expanding greatly. The basic structure of such
magnetic cards comprises a non-magnetic base material and
a magnetic layer formed on top of the non-magnetic base
material, and the magnetic layer is used to magnetically
record proprietary information. It is essential to
prevent unlawful uses enabled by copying or altering of
the proprietary information on such media, and there have 
been many methods which are being used to prevent illegal
uses of magnetic cards.Representative examples of counterfeit preventing
measures can be divided into two broad categories: the
first method is to make reproduction of magnetic
information difficult; and the second method is to
incorporate a piece of identifier coding data so as to
identify counterfeited cards.The first method is based on making the reproduction
of magnetic information difficult, and there are known
examples such as providing a multilayer section for
magnetic recording in which to hide the correct
information, or providing superfluous information to make
analysis of the correct information difficult. However,
such methods suffer from the disadvantages of complexity
of manufacturing, and the requirement for special
equipment to read/write the correct information.
Furthermore, once the details of the technique of hiding
the correct information are discovered, it is not
possible to prevent someone skilled in the art to analyze
the data, and to easily duplicate the information or to
produce a counterfeit product.The second method is based on including a special
identifier codes in the magnetic card, and such a card
cannot be put to actual use unless the card is certified
to be genuine, even though the card may contain
duplicated magnetic information. However, such cards
also suffer from disadvantages of difficult manufacturing 
process, and the requirement of special reading devices
for the identifier codes. Also, this type of card has
another major disadvantage that it is not
