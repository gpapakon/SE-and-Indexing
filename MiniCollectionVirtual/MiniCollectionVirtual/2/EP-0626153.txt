<ABSTRACT>
A stent for placing in a tubular organ so as to support its 
diameter to remain above a critical diameter. The stent comprises a spiral 

coil or cylinder made of a two-way shape memory alloy and has a super-elastic 
state in which the stent's diameter is at least about the critical 

diameter or more but within a physiological range tolerated by the organ and 
having a soft state in which the stent's diameter, after changing to this state 

from the super-elastic state, which is less than the critical diameter. The 
shape memory alloy has two transition temperatures being within a range 

that will not damage biological tissue, of which a first transition temperature 
is a temperature in which it changes from the soft state to the super-elastic 

state and of which a second transition temperature is a temperature in which 
it changes from the super-elastic state to the soft state. The arrangem
ent 
being such that after changing into one of the two states, the stent remains 

in that state at body temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides stents intended for placing 
inside tubular organs so as to prevent narrowing of the organ's diameter 
below a certain critical diameter. More specifically, the present invention 
provides stents made of two-way shape memory alloy. The present invention further provides a catheter device for 
deploying or removing the stents. In many clinical situations it is necessary to ensure that a 
tubular organ will retain a diameter above a certain critical diameter. Such 
is the case, for example, where a coronary artery is expanded with an 
angioplasty catheter, in which case it is desired to prevent the expanded 
portion from being narrowed again. Another example is in the case of 
tracheal cancer, in which it is necessary to ensure that the trachea remains 
open in order to avoid suffocation.  Stents prepared by weaving a stainless steel wire in the form 
of a net has been proposed (Surgery, 1986, 99, 199-205). Another stent 
formed of a one-way shape memory allow was proposed in Japanese 
Published Application No. 61-6655. Such stents are introduced into a 
predetermined location in the tubular organ and then allowed to expand. 
However, such stents after once put in position are fixed and cannot be 
removed. This is a serious drawback in cases where the stent has to be 
removed or when the initial position of the stent is inaccurate and has to be 
improved. In all such cases, removal of the stent can cause serious injury 
to the tubular organ. U.S. Patent No. 5,037,427, discloses a stent made of a two-way 
shape memory alloy and means for its deployment in and recovery from 
a tubular organ. In accordance with this patent, the stent has a transition 
temperature which is below the body temperature in which it changes its 
diameter from a narrow diameter to a wide diameter in which it attaches to 
the walls of the tubular organ. The stent is inserted into the tubular organ 
under a constant flow of cold fluid and once the correct position of stent is 
reached, the flow of the cold fluid is stopped and the stent then expends 
under the influence of the body temperature. For removal, the stent is 
cooled again and withdrawn under a continuous application of a cold fluid. 
It will no doubt be appreciated that a continuous application of a cold fluid 
may not always be practical, and this is a continuous drawback for various 
applications. It is the object of the present invention to provide a novel 
stent. It is furthermore the object of the present invention to provide 
a stent

<CLAIMS>
A stent for placing in a tubular organ so as to support its 
diameter to remain above a critical diameter, the stent comprising: 

   a spiral coil (14) or cylinder (78) made of a two-way shape memory 

alloy; having a super-elastic state in which the stent's diameter is at least 
about said critical diameter or more but within a physiological range 

tolerated by said organ and having a soil state in which the stent's diameter, 
after changing to this state from the super-elastic state, which is less than 

said critical diameter; 
   the shape memory alloy has two transition temperatures (T₁, T₂) being 

within a range that will not damage biological tissue, of which a first 
transition temperature (T₁) is a temperature in which it changes from said 

soil state to said super-elastic state and of which a second transition 
temperature (T₂) is a temperature in which it changes from said super-elastic 

state to said soil state; whereby after changing into one of the two states, the 
stent remains in that state at body temperature. 
A stent according to Claim 1, being a helical coil (16). 
A stent according to Claim 1 or 2, consisting of two or more 
discrete stent members. 
A stent according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
its extreme ends (T₁, T₃) have a different transition temperature than its 

middle portion (T₂). 
A catheter device (20) adapted for carrying a stent according 
to any one of Claims 1 to 4 in said soil state of the stent, and for deploying 

the stent in a tubular organ. 
A device according to Claim 5, adapted also for removal of the 
deployed stent. 
A device according to Claim 5 or 6 comprising an elongated 
flexible tube (22) having a guide member (26)at its front end with a base of 

a diameter larger than the flexible tube (22), and having an annular 
member (28) fitted on said tube at a distance from said tapered member; 

the tube having a closed front end and being fitted at its front end portion, 
proximal to said guide member, with lateral nozzles (24), the tube being

being held on said tube (22) on the portion thereof being between said guide 

member and said annular member (28); upon insertion of the device into 
a tubular body, warm fluid is ejected through said nozzles (24), whereby the 

stent, changing into its super-elastic state, expands and is deployed in said 
organ.
