<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a composition and method for treating edible glyceride oils to remove contaminants therefrom. The composition can be added directly to crude oil, degummed oil, or used oil to reduce free fatty acids, color bodies, trace metals, and other impurities. The composition comprises solid alkali metal silicate, particularly sodium metasilicate pentahydrate and hydrous sodium polysilicate. This material is added to oil in an amount approximately equal to the amount of free fatty acids present in the oil. The oil may then be heated and agitated. The oil is then filtered or centrifuged to remove the solid hydrous sodium silicate.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Process for Reducing Contaminants in Glyceride OilsFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention pertains to a composition and method for treating edible glyceride oils to remove contaminants, chiefly free-fatty acids (FFA) . The composition and process may be applied either to rejuvenation of used oils or refining of crude edible glyceride oils. 
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONEdible glyceride oils, at various stages of their production and use, contain variable amounts of non-glyceride impurities. In refining crude edible oils, these impurities must be removed through the refining process. In used glyceride oils, these impurities build up as the oil is used, and if removed will increase the useable life of the oil. In the refining process, these impurities influence both the way the oil responds in the various processing steps employed to produce a finished product, and the yield of finished oil. In the reuse of used oil, an increase in impurities can degrade the oil, which can adversely affect its taste and shelf-life and may increase its ability to be absorbed by foods. Accordingly, it is desirable to remove these impurities at whatever stage of oil production and use they occur, whenever possible. 
Table 1Table 1 shows some of the impurities contained in crude glyceride oils, which can be removed by the refining process. In the refining process, the oils are treated with caustic soda in the primary steps. The caustic soda forms a flocculant precipitate of soaps which settle out as "foots." The addition of an alkali solution to crude or crude degummed oil results in chemical reactions and physical changes. The alkali combines with free-fatty acids in the oil to form soaps. The phosphatides and gums absorb alkali and are coagulated through hydra ion or degradation. Much of the coloring matter is degraded and absorbed by the gums, or made water soluble by the alkali. The insoluble matter is entrained with the other coagulated material. The soap-oil mixture is then heated to about 160-180°F (75- 82°C) and fed through a centrifuge for separation into 

light and heavy density phases. The light phase comprises chiefly refined oils including traces of moisture and soap. The heavy phase is primarily soap, insoluble matter, free caustic, phosphatides, and 5-9% of neutral oil.The refined oil (light phase) is discharged from the centrifuge, heated to 190°F (88°C) and mixed with soft water that has been heated to 200°F (93°C). The water-oil mixture passes through a high-speed shear mixer to obtain intimate contact
