<ABSTRACT>
A tape recording and reproducing system records blocks of user data of predetermined size by reformatting the user data blocks into physical blocks that are recorded on tape. Each physical block is recorded as a double frame on a set of successive helical tracks, preferably 32 tracks. The system has the capability of verifying whether a physical block has been accurately recorded, and if not, the system rewrites the physical block downstream without stopping or repositioning the tape. If an accuracy verification confirmation does not occur until a next physical block is being recorded, the system demarks or invalidates that physical block being written, and rewrites both the failed physical block and that following physical block dowstream of that physical block being written.

<DESCRIPTION>
Data Recording System having Improved Automatic Rewrite Capability and Method of Rewriting, by Lionel Shih, European patent application No. 93904556.3 filed 21 January 1993 (published as WO-A-93/17425).The present invention relates to mass storage devices, and more particularly, to
recording and reproducing apparatus and methods for achieving very high density recording of
digital information at very high transfer rates. The market for mass storage devices is growing at what seems to be an ever
increasing rate with the sales of high-performance computers penetrating numerous industries
ranging from financial institutions to oil exploration companies. The processing power of these
high-performance systems, and the data they generate, are increasing faster than the ability of
storage devices to keep pace. The problem of data storage and rapid retrieval is particularly
pronounced in computational-intensive applications which create huge amounts of data that need to
be accessed in seconds rather than minutes, hours or even days.Magnetic disks remain the preferred media for direct access to frequently used files
because of their fast access times. However, because of their high cost per-unit of storage (such
as a megabyte) and their limited capacity, magnetic disk recorders are prohibitively expensive and
therefore impractical for large-scale data storage. With the advances in magnetic tape technology,
tape based systems remain the preferred choice for mass data storage. In addition to cost,
magnetic tape exceeds the storage density of any other medium, at least from a volumetric
standpoint, because tape is a much thinner medium than, for example, magnetic disks, and tape
can be tightly packed. A general discussion of such technology may be found in Mass Storage
Technologies, by S. Ranada, published in 1991 by Meckler Publishing.The tape format basically defines the recording path used to record signals on the
tape. There are many different recording formats developed for data recording and reproducing.
A commonly used format for high capacity systems is IBM's 3480 multi-track tape cartridge
format in which the tape transport employs a stationary head and records data along longitudinal
tracks. Since the late 1970's rotary head helical scan recorders, a technology developed originally
for video recorders, have been used for recording data In helical scan recorders, the tape is
transported past a rapidly rotating head along a helical path whereby data is recorded diagonally
across the tape. Compared to

<CLAIMS>
A system adapted to selectively record and reproduce
digital data on a recording medium, said system comprising:


means adapted to selectively record and reproduce user data
and system format data in physical blocks of data of

predetermined size on a recording area of said medium, said
recording means being adapted to immediately reproduce data

recorded during a recording process;
error detecting means adapted to receive said immediately
reproduced data from said recording means for detecting

writing errors during a recording process, said error
detecting means producing an error signal for a particular

physical block when writing errors exceed predetermined
criteria;
servo means for controlling the movement of said medium in
said first direction and a second opposite direction, said

servo means moving said medium in said first direction
during normal recording and reproducing; and
processing means for generating said system format data and
for providing said user data and said system format data to

said recording means for recording thereby on said medium,
said processing means generating a subarea matrix of said

system format data, said processing means being adapted to
generate data designating said particular block as being

invalid in response to said detecting means producing an
error signal for a particular physical block of data;
characterised in that
 the system format data (FSN, FDBN) and
the user data for the said particular block are recorded

in one of the next two physical blocks after the said
particular block in response to the production of the error

signal indicating that the particular physical block
contains writing errors exceeding said predetermined

criteria. 
A system according to claim 1 wherein said servo means
moves said medium in said first direction generally

continuously at a predetermined speed during a recording
process.
A system according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the said
one block is the next block recorded after the said

particular block when the detection of the said writing
errors occurs early in the recording of the said particular

block and the said one block is the next-but-one block after
the said particular block when the detection of the said

writing errors occurs late in the recording of the
particular block.
