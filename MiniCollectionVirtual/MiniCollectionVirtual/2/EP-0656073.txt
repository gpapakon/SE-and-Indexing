<ABSTRACT>
An austenitic, stainless steel alloy having a good combination of galling resistance and corrosion resistance is disclosed containing in weight percent about (I), and the balance of the alloy is essentially iron. This alloy also has good resistance to formation of deformation-induced martensite as indicated by the alloy's low work-hardening rate and low magnetic permeability when cold-rolled to a 50 % reduction in cross-sectional area.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CORROSION RESISTANT AUSTENITIC STAINLESS STEEL WITH IMPROVED GALLING RESISTANCEField of the InventionThis invention relates to an austenitic stainless steel alloy and in particular to such an alloy, and articles made therefrom, having a better combination of galling resistance, corrosion resistance, and resistance to formation of deformation-induced martensite, than known austenitic stainless steels. The alloy according to this invention also provides a low work hardening rate compared to the known galling resistant, austenitic, stainless steels.Background of the InventionIt is generally known that standard types of stainless steels have limited galling resistance. In many commercial applications requiring stainless steel, lubricants cannot be used to prevent galling of the steel surface. For example, in the food processing industry contamination concerns prohibit the use of any lubricants to prevent galling. In response to these concerns, several galling resistant stainless steel alloys were developed having superior galling resistance compared to conventional austenitic stainless steels. Two specialty galling resistant stainless steels, sold under the trademarks Nitronic 60速 and Gall-Tough速, have high threshold galling stress values (TGS) , nominally 7 ksi (48 MPa) and 15 ksi (103 MPa), respectively. U.S. Patent No. 4,039,356, Schumacher et al., describes the galling resistant austenitic stainless steel alloy sold under the trademark Nitronic 60速 (registered trademark of Ar co, Inc., Middletown, OH).

The alloys disclosed and claimed in Schumacher et al. and Magee, Jr. provide general corrosion resistance comparable to AISI Type 304 stainless steel. That level of corrosion resistance is adequate for use in many chloride- containing environments. However, some applications,SUBSTITUTE SHEET
