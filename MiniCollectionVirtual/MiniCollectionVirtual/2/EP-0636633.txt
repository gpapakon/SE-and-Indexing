<ABSTRACT>
A novel triterpenoid saponin having neither 
unpleasant tastes, such as astringency and bitterness, 

nor inhibitory effect on the sweet taste responses but 
having an inhibitory effect on glucose absorption, a 

preventive and therapeutic agent for diabetes mellitus, 
an additive to a diet and a diet containing the 

triterpenoid saponin. 
The triterpenoid saponin comprises 
(3β,16β)-16,28-dihydroxyolean-12-en-3-yl-2-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-β-D-glucopyranosiduronic 

acid. The intended triterpenoid 
saponin can be provided by subjecting leaves of Gymnema 

inodorum widely distributed in Southeast Asia to 
extraction with a solvent, evaporating the extract to 

dryness, washing the residue with an acid to remove base 
ingredients, defatting the washed residue, extracting the 

defatted residue with acetone, evaporating the extract to 
dryness, extracting the residue with diethyl carbonate to 

provide a crude crystal, dissolving the crude crystal in 
methanol, collecting a fraction eluted in a period 

between 31.0 min and 33.0 min by HPLC, and 
recrystallizing the fraction from a solvent of 

acetone/chloroform (50/50). A therapeutic agent for 
diabetes mellitus comprising as an active ingredient the 

triterpenoid saponin thus obtained, and a diet comprising 
as an additive the triterpenoid saponin are also 

provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel 
triterpenoid saponin having no unpleasant taste, such as 
astringency, and substantially no inhibitory effect on 
the sweet taste responses but having an inhibitory effect 
on glucose absorption and a process for producing the 
same. Further, the present invention relates to a 
preventive and therapeutic agent for diabetes mellitus. Further, the present invention relates to a 
diet containing a triterpenoid saponin that is a novel 
compound having an inhibitory effect on glucose 
absorption. Phlorizin, Gymnemic acid and Ziziphin are known 
as substances having an inhibitory effect on glucose 
absorption. However, these substances had a problem 
regarding use because Gymnemic acid and Ziziphin have an 
inhibitory effect on the sweet taste responses and, in 
particular, Gymnemic acid has bitterness. The present inventors have previously found 
that leaves of a plant called "Gymnema inodorum" widely 
distributed in Southeast Asia contain a substance that 
has no astringency, bitterness and inhibitory effect on 
the sweet taste responses but has an inhibitory effect on 
glucose absorption, and proposed an inhibitor for the 
absorption of glucose that is in the form of a tea 
prepared by drying and roasting the leaves of Gymnema 
inodorum or in the form of tablets or granules prepared  
 
by subjecting the leaves of Gymnema inodorum to 
extraction with hot water, an alcohol or the like and 
concentrating or drying the extract (see Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 3-172156). Thereafter, the present inventors have made 
extensive and intensive studies on a method for 
separating and purifying an active ingredient having an 
inhibitory effect on glucose absorption from the above-described 
Gymnema inodorum and, as a result, have 
succeeded in separating and purifying a triterpenoid 
saponin having no astringency, bitterness and inhibitory 
effect on the sweet taste responses but having an 
inhibitory effect on glucose absorption, and have found 
that the triterpenoid saponin is useful as a preventive 
and therapeutic agent for diabetes mellitus. Further, the present inventors have newly found 
that the addition of the active ingredient to diets 
enables the absorption of glucose to be effectively 
inhibited. Thereafter, the present inventors have made 
extensive and intensive studies on a method for 
separating and purifying an active ingredient having no 
astringency, bitterness and inhibitory effect on the 
sweet taste responses but having an
