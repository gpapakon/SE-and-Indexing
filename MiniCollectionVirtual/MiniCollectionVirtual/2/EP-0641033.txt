<ABSTRACT>
In the course of the processes for fabricating catalytically active gas diffusion electrodes a hydrophobic gas-permeable membrane is coated with a catalyst in finely disperse form. To this end, either a patterning mask having cut-outs is applied to the membrane and the catalyst in powdered form is dispersed with a Teflon dispersion and a polyether gel to give a paste which is applied with the aid of a proportioning appliance into the cut-outs of the patterning mask, or the paste is applied to the membrane in accordance with a screen printing process or a film coating process. With respect to the first process according to the invention see [lacuna].

<CLAIMS>
A method for manufacturing catalytically active gas
diffusion electrodes for electrochemical cells in which a

hydrophobic gas-permeable membrane is coated with a
catalyst having a finely dispersed form, characterised in

that a structuring mask (3) having cut outs (4)is placed
on said membrane (1) and the catalyst in powdered form is

dispersed with a PTFE-dispersion and a polyether gel to a
paste, which is applied to the cut outs (4) of the

structuring mask (3) with a closing device.
The method as defined in claim 1, characterised in
that the structuring mask containing the catalytic paste,

which is placed on said membrane (1) is covered with a
film and the thus formed entire layered composite ((1, 2,

3) is compressed with a pressure of 1 bar to 20 bar.
The method as defined in claim 1 or 2, characterised
by removing the polyether gel completely from the

catalytic coat by washing and subsequent drying.
The method as defined in anyone of claims 1 to 3,
characterised by fixing individual membranes through the

structuring masks in the cut outs and coating the
membranes with the paste.
The method for manufacturing catalytically active
gas diffusion electrodes as defined in one or more of the

preceding claims, characterised by using a pressure
template having a thickness between 0,05 - 0,7 mm. 
The method for manufacturing catalytically active

gas diffusion electrodes as defined in one or more of the
preceding claims, characterised by the catalyst being

gold powder.
The method for manufacturing catalytically active
gas diffusion electrodes as defined in one or more of the

preceding claims, characterised by the catalyst being
platinum black.
The method for manufacturing catalytically active
gas diffusion electrodes as defined in one or more of the

preceding claims, characterised by the catalyst being
ruthenium mohr.
The method for manufacturing catalytically active
gas diffusion electrodes as defined in one or more of the

preceding claims, characterised by the catalyst being
silver powder.
