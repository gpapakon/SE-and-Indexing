<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a method for producing a single cell oil containing gamma-linolenic acid characterised in that at least one microorganism of the order Mucorales preferably of the genus Mortierella, Actinomucor, Mucor, Rhizomucor or Rhizopus is cultured in a growth medium which is substantially starch and sugar free and which contains, as a carbon source material, at least one monocarboxylic acid of 2 to 5 carbon atoms, preferably acetic acid and recovering the oil from the resultant cultured microorganism biomass. The invention also relates to a method of creating the organic acid stream of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process to remove organic material therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS invention relates to a biological method of
treating industrial effluent carrying carbon containing
chemicals but which is substantially devoid of starches
and sugars. It also relates to a method of cultivating
microorganisms and to the recovery of valuable
metabolites therefrom.Carbon based industrial chemical processes often give
rise to aqueous effluent streams carrying a variety of
carbon containing compounds. Thus, for example, it is
known that the Synthol or Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis in
which hydrocarbons, aliphatic alcohols, aldehydes and
ketones are produced by the catalytic hydrogenations of
carbon monoxide gives rise to an aqueous by-product or
effluent stream, known as the "Fischer Tropsch organic
acid stream". This stream typically contains between
1% and 3% of C2 to C5 monocarboxylic acids along with
non-acidic chemicals such as ketones and aldehydes.
This stream is conventionally treated by an activated
sludge to strip the stream of its carbon content before
recycling the purified water into the cooling circuit
of the plant or running it into a river or the sea.
The resultant biomass is either incinerated or may be
disposed of as fertilizer. In an unrelated field of technology it is known that
certain microorganisms, known as oleaginous organisms,
are capable of producing edible oils which oils have
become known as Single Cell Oils or SCO's. [See for
example the overview SINGLE CELL OIL edited by R.S.
Moreton, Longman Scientific & Technical, 1988]According to the work of Moreton referred to above, the
first truly commercial SCO process is the one being
carried out at the plant of Sturge Biochemicals in the
United Kingdom at which a lipid rich in gamma linolenic
acid [GLA; 6,9,12-octadecatrienoic acid] is produced.
According to a report by K.W. Sinden of John and E.
Sturge Limited [EnzymeMicrob.Technol., 1987 Vol. 9
p. 124-125] the microbial oil rich in GLA is produced
by a Mucorsp. cultivated on a pure defined substrate
based on glucose.Gamma Linolenic Acid is a high value product which
occurs in several natural products including breast
milk, evening primrose oil, oats and other products.
In the human and animal body it is converted to
prostaglandin E1, one of the important localised
hormone type products regulating the body functions of
the kidneys, liver, lungs, brain, nerve system and
immune system. Products containing GLA are presently
widely used in many parts of the world as a component
of health food programs. A large number of oleaginous organisms has been
reported in the
