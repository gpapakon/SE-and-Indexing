<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an information recording medium
such as an optical disc, a magnetooptical disc or the like, and
an information reproducing apparatus which is suitably used to
reproduce information from the information recording medium.For a conventional optical disc used in a CAV (constant
angular velocity) mode, a servo byte section is periodically
provided at a prescribed position on each track, and clock pits
to generate reference clocks and wobbled pits for tracking are
formed in the servo byte section. The reference clocks (channel
clocks) are formed in accordance with the clock pits, and
information is digitally recorded in accordance with pits whose
length is set to be integer times of the period of the reference
clocks.A system which is used in a CLV (Constant Linear Velocity)
such as a CD (Compact Disc) is formed with no clock pit, however,
the length of recorded pits and the interval of the pits are set
to be integer times (any one of nine length levels from about
0.9µm to 3.3µm for CD) of the period (0.3µm) of the reference
clocks (channel clocks)(so-called self-clock system is adopted),
and clock components contained in reproduced RF signals are 
extracted to cut out the recorded information on a pit basis.For a video disc which is the same type of optical disc as
the CD, video signals are FM-modulated, recorded and reproduced
on the basis of the difference in length between pits which are
designed in a finer size than those for CDs. This will be
described in more detail representatively using a case where
signals are recorded in the CAV mode on a 55mm-radius disc.In the case of the video disc, the lightest portion of
recording information is recorded with signals of 9.3MHz while
the darkest portion is recorded with signals of 7.6MHz, and these
signals correspond to the lengths of 1.075µm and 1.316µm on the
55mm-radius disc, respectively. It is well known that a very
beautiful picture can be reproduced by reproducing information
from the disc which is recorded in the above recording mode.
Assuming that the picture thus obtained is represented in 128
gradation levels (that is, variation in brightness of the picture
is represented in 128 levels), this means that pits constituting
the picture thus obtained are recorded while varying the pit
period in 128 or more levels, and reproduced. That is, the minute
variation in pit length and pit interval as represented by the
following equation reflects the video signals:
(1.316µm - 1.075µm) / 128 = 0.002µmAlthough such minute variation in pit
