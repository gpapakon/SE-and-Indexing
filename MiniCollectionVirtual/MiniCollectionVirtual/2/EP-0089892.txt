<ABSTRACT>
An acoustic method and apparatus for investigating an 
earth formation penetrated by a borehole are described. 

Acoustic transducers are mounted on a tool to accurately 
determine the distance between a segment of the tool and 

the wall of the borehole. The acoustic transducers are 
positioned in such manner that the stand-off distance 

between individual resistivity measuring electrodes in an 
array, which is also mount
ed on the tool segment, and the 
borehole wall can be measured. The stand-off measurement 

is recorded and may be used to correct the electrode 
resistivity measurements. In one embodiment a calibration 

of acoustic transducers as a function of depth is obtained by 
employing acoustic calibrating transducers to compensate 

for borehole environment effects on the performance of the 
acoustic transducers as well as determine the acoustic 

velocity of the borehole fluid, such as mud. Several embodiÂ­
ments are described.
