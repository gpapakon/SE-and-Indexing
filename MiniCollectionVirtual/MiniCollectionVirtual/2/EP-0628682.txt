<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle door latch includes a forked 
element (14) encapsulated in an elastomeric coating 

(36). The coating (36) covers a face (58) of the 
forked element (14) engaged by a detent member (18) so 

that the elastomeric coating (36) quietens the 
latching engagement of the detent member (18) with the 

forked element (14). The elastomeric coating (36) is 
an inelastic, internally lubricated reinforced 

plastics material which wears progressively as the 
door latch is repeatedly latched and unlatched. Thus, 

the elastomeric coating (36) is sacrificed and 
eventually wears away so that the latching engagement 

reverts, over the lifetime of the door latch, to a 
direct metal to metal engagement of the detent (18) 

with the engagement face (58) of the forked element 
(14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vehicle door 
latch. It is well known in motor vehicles to 
provide a latch on a vehicle door which engages a pin 
mounted on the vehicle body so as to latch the door in 
a closed position. Conventionally, the door latch includes a 
pivotally mounted forked element which includes a slot 
opening towards the pin when the latch is in an open 
position. When the door closes, the pin slides into 
the slot and rotates the forked element to a latched 
position in which the pin is captured in the slot of 
the forked element. A detent member provided on the 
latch is also pivoted on the latch housing and engages 
an engagement face of the forked element to latch the 
forked element in the closed position. It is desirable to provide a door latch 
which is relatively quiet when the door is closed. 
The prior art has heretofore taught that coating 
various portions of the forked element with 
elastomeric coatings would quieten the door closing 
operation, by eliminating metal to metal contact 
between parts of the door latch. However, in general, 
the prior art has taught not to provide an elastomeric 
coating on the face of the forked element which 
engages the detent member, so that metal to metal 
contact occurs between the detent member and the 
forked element on closing of the door. US-A-4,756,564 
provides an elastic member of a soft material which is 
pushed or compressed into a recess on the forked 
element to permit direct engagement of the detent 
member with the latching face of the forked element. The present invention seeks to provide an 
improved vehicle door latch.  According to an aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a vehicle door latch as 
specified in claim 1. In a preferred embodiment, the forked 
element of a door latch is encapsulated in an 
elastomeric coating, moulded in situ thereon, and 
covering the face of the forked element engaged by the 
detent member so that the elastomeric coating quietens 
the latching engagement of the detent member with the 
forked element. The elastomeric coating is an 
inelastic, internally lubricated reinforced plastics 
material which wears progressively as the door latch 
is repeatedly latched and unlatched. The elastomeric 
coating is sacrificed and, towards the end of the 
lifetime of the vehicle, it eventually wears away so 
that the latching engagement reverts, over the 
lifetime of the door latch, to a direct metal to metal 
engagement of the detent with the engagement face of 
the forked element. An
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A vehicle door latch comprising a forked 
element (14) pivotally mounted within a latch housing 

(12) of a vehicle door, the forked element including a 
recess (30) for receiving a latching pin (26), and a 

detent member (18) pivotally mounted in the housing 
and engageable with a face (58) of the forked element 

so as to latch the forked element in a closed 
position; characterised in that the face of the forked 

element is coated with an elastomeric coating (38). 
A vehicle door latch according to claim 
1, wherein the coating is formed from an internally 

lubricated reinforced thermoplastics material. 
A vehicle door latch according to claim 
1 or 2, wherein the coating (38) includes an elevated 

abutment face (58) adjacent an uncoated portion of the 
forked element (14), the detent member (18) in use 

engaging the elevated abutment face. 
A vehicle door latch according to claim 
1, 2 or 3, wherein the coating is adapted to wear 

progressively as the door latch is repeatedly latched 

and unlatched in use.
