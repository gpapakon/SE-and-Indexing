<CLAIMS>
Film-like flexible and bendable synthetic resin material (2) having a
thickness of less than 0.5 mm comprising spatially arranged pieces or strips

(1) of scrap thermoplastic synthetic resin film bonded together by the action
of pressure and temperature.
Film-like synthetic resin material according to claim 1, characterised
in that the synthetic resin material (2) has a homogeneous structure.
Film-like synthetic resin material according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the film-like synthetic material has openings in it.
Film-like synthetic resin material according to one or more of the
foregoing claims, characterised in that the film-like synthetic resin material

is shrunk.
Film-like synthetic resin material including to claim 4, characterised
in that it is shrunk to form a net.
Film-like synthetic resin material according to one of the foregoing
claims, characterised in that the pieces or strips of film which are used are

of three-dimensional form.
Film-like synthetic resin material according to one of the foregoing

claims, characterised in that the material is partially compressed or
provided with a stamped-out structure.
Film-like synthetic resin material according to one of the foregoing
claims, characterised in that the material comprises a carrier made of thin 

polyethylene film and that the pieces of synthetic resin lying on it comprise
thin films and form a thin layer.
Film-like synthetic resin material according to one of the foregoing
claims, characterised in that the pieces or strips (1) of film comprise

different synthetic resin materials.
Method of producing the film-like synthetic resin material according
to one of the foregoing claims, characterised in that the scrap films of

thermoplastic synthetic resins are reduced to uneven strips or pieces (1),
deposited in at least one layer on a track and are bonded together by rolling

with the action of pressure and temperature to form a film-like synthetic
resin material (2) having a thickness below 0.5 mm.
