<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of human immunodeficiency viruses.More particularly, the present invention relates to new variants of the HIV-3 retrovirus strain deposited at the European Collection of
Animal Cell Cultures (ECACC), under N° V880 60301 and the further embodiments characterized in the claims.Substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
or AIDS. The prinicipal causative .agent has been demonstrated to be a non-transforming retrovirus with a
tropism for T4 helper/inducer lymphocytes (1,2) and it has been estimated that millions of people world-wide
have already been infected. Infection with this virus leads, at least in a significant percentage of cases,
to a progressive depletion of the T4 lymphocyte population with a concomittant increasing susceptibility to
the opportunistic infections which are characteristic of the disease.Epidemiological studies indicate that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the etiological
agent responsible for the majority of AIDS cases and which is currently the most widely disseminated HIV,
probably had its origins in Central Africa (3). The discovery of this virus did not necessarily imply the
existence of other types of human immunodeficiency viruses. Nevertheless, a second group of human
immunodeficiency-associated retroviruses, human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2), was identified in
West Africa (4,5). An HIV-2 virus is disclosed in EPO-85/00548. An HIV-1 virus is disclosed in EPO-0 239
425. Other similar, but not identical, retroviruses have also been isolated from simian sources (simian
immunodeficiency virus, SIV) such as African green monkeys (6,7) and macaques (8,9). The simian isolates
have been shown to be genetically more closely related to HIV-2 than HIV-1 but are nevertheless distinct
(10).One characteristic of human immunodeficiency viruses which complicates their comparison' is their
genetic variability; genetic variants arise spontaneously and with high frequency. A comparison of various
HIV-1 isolates revealed that some regions of the genome are highly variable while others are reasonably
well conserved (11-16). Similar polymorphisms have also been observed for HIV-2 (17). The regions with
the greatest genetic stability are presumably those regions coding for the regions of viral proteins which are
structurally or enzymatically essential. The viral genes with the greatest overall genetic stability are the gag
and pol genes, while some regions of the env gene and the
