<DESCRIPTION>
Title; Recombinant Plant EnzymeField of the InventionThis invention relates to the novel nucleotide sequence of a gene encoding a plant enzyme, functional equivalents thereof, vectors containing the novel nucleotide sequence, a method of producing the enzyme, a method of altering the characteristics of a plant and plants having been so altered.Background of the InventionMany plants and plant-derived materials (eg sunflowers, oil seed rape) are of commercial significance because they are a source of valuable vegetable oils. These oils (or lipids) consist of fatty acid residues (relatively long hydrocarbon chains) joined by ester links to propan -1, 2, 3 - triol (otherwise known as glycerol).In some higher plants, de novo fatty acid biosynthesis is known to be catalyzed by two enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase. The end product of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis is palmitoyl-ACP (Acyl Carrier Protein) which is then rapidly elongated to stearoyl-ACP. A highly specific stearoyl-ACP desaturase ensures that the only unsaturated fatty acid in high abundance is oleoyl-ACP. Another enzyme, acyl-ACP thioesterase is thought to play an important role in the chain termination of fatty acid biosynthesis by catalysing 

the hydrolysis of acyl-ACP to free fatty acid and ACP. It is believed that subsequently the free fatty acid is incorporated into complex lipids.Acyl-ACP thioesterases may be characterised by their preferred substrates. Thus acyl-ACP thioesterases showing preferential enzymatic activity for long chain fatty acids (eg C18 compounds) may be termed "long chain thioesterases".Some long chain acyl-ACP thioesterases from plants have been identified and purified. These include the enzymes from Avocado and Safflower (Ohlrogge et al., [1978] Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics 189, 382-391 and McKeon & Stumpf, [1982] Journal of Biological Chemistry 257, 12,141-12,147, respectively). However, no-one has been able to obtain the DNA sequence encoding such a long chain thioesterase. Such information would allow the application of modern recombinant DNA techniques to manipulate the enzyme characteristics (eg level of expression), and hence the characteristics of transgenic plants.Summary of the inventionIn one aspect the invention provides a nucleotide sequence, encoding an enzyme precursor having an acyl-ACP thioesterase activity, comprising the sequence of nucleotides 169-1269 shown in Figure 1 (Seq. ID No. 1) or functional equivalents thereof.As will be apparent to those skilled in the
