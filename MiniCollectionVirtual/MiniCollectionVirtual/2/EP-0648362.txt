<ABSTRACT>
A power supply for providing a symmetric drive for an AC electroluminescent (EL) display panel includes a single power supply which provides two voltage signal values of opposite polarity Vpos, Vneg to the panel's row drivers. The supply also corrects the difference between the two voltage signal values Vpos, Vneg as a function of the difference between the maximum column driver voltage value Vcol and its nominal value to reduce latent images on the display panel. By utilizing a single switching regulator to generate the opposite polarity row voltages Vpos, Vneg the circuit complexity and cost associated with providing a symmetric drive for an EL panel is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONSymmetric Drive for an Electroluminescent Display PanelCross Reference to Related ApplicationsThis application contains subject matter related to commonly assigned co-pending application, Attorney Docket N-1205, Serial Number 07/906,595, entitled "Gray- Scale Stepped Ramp Generator With Individual Step Correction" filed even date herewith.Technical FieldThis invention relates to electroluminescent displays, and more particularly to an improved symmetric display drive.Background ArtThe operation of an AC thin film electroluminescent (TFEL) display panel is based on the principle that a luminescent material (e.g., phosphor) will emit light when a voltage of sufficient magnitude is applied across it. The TFEL display is typically constructed with luminescent material sandwiched between a dielectic insulator and a plurality of row electrodes on one side, and a plurality of column electrodes on the opposite side. Each intersection of the plurality of row and column electrodes defines a pixel. A typical high resolution TFEL display panel may have 512 row electrodes and 640 column electrodes, resulting in 327,680 pixels. Commonly assigned U.S. Application, Serial Number 07/897,201, Attorney Docket Number R-3612N, entitled "Low Resistance, Thermally Stable 

Electrode Structure for Electroluminescent Displays" filed June 11, 1992, discloses the construction of a TFEL display panel.The luminance of each pixel in the panel is dependent upon the magnitude of the voltage applied across the particular row and column electrode which define the pixel. As a result of this relationship, gray shading can be achieved by controlling the magnitude of the voltage across the pixel. As an example, each pixel may display one of sixteen luminance levels depending on the magnitude of the voltage applied across the pixel. The magnitude of the minimum voltage required across the pixel before the electroluminescent material will display light is often referred to as the threshold voltage.A problem with a TFEL display panel is that it often suffers from latent imaging problems which cause ghost images on the display panel. This is typically a result of the pixel's voltage-time average being non- zero when averaged over several scans through the panel. U.S. Patent 4,975,691 to J.Y. Lee entitled "Scan Inversion Symmetric Drive" discusses the problem of latent images and discloses alternating the order the rows are scanned in an attempt to reduce the latent images. More particularly the '691 patent discloses the steps of
