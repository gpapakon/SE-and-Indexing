<ABSTRACT>
The bolt for panic-safe locks is installable in one 
door of a double door and is operatively associated with a 

strike lock installable in another door thereof. A flat 
sliding plate (20) is accommodated in a seat (10) of the 

bolt (3) and guided, against the biasing action of elastic 
transmission means (17), at right angles to the sliding 

direction of the bolt (3). The sliding plate (20) has a lug 
(30) for abutment against a fixed element (4) of the lock 

when the bolt (3) is engaged in the strike lock. A slider 
(35) is guided in the bolt (3) parallel to the sliding 

direction of the bolt (3) and has a tang (38) protruding 
frontally from the bolt (3). The slider (35) cooperates 

with the sliding plate (20) so that when the bolt (3) is 
engaged within the strike lock, the release action produced 

on the tang (38) by means of the strike lock causes the 
slider (35) to move the sliding plate (20) into a position 

in which the lug (30) does not abut against the fixed 
element (4), allowing retraction of the bolt (3) into the 

lock due to the release action.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bolt for locks, 
particularly for panic-safe locks for double doors. In double doors, used as emergency doors, both doors 
open outward, and the door normally used to enter and to 
exit (hereinafter termed door A) is provided with a panicsafe 
lock having a spring latch and a bolt and designed so 
that the spring latch and the bolt can be moved 
simultaneously into their release position by operating the 
handle. The other door (hereinafter termed door B) acts as 
lock stile for door A and has an upper catch and a lower 
catch which are connected by means of rods to a so-called 
panic-safe strike lock actuatable by means of a handle of 
its own. The particularity of emergency doors of this kind is 
that the spring latch and the bolt of the lock installed on 
door A engage selvages of the strike lock of door B, the 
mechanism of which is set so that if only the lock of door 
A is operated to open it, i.e. if the latch and the bolt 
are retracted, it is possible to open only door A, since 
the strike lock keeps its catches in locking position. On the other hand, in the strike lock of door B there 
is a pusher which, when the strike lock is actuated, is 
expelled by said strike lock and acts on a sort of 
pushbutton that releases the mechanism of the lock of door 
A, causing the retraction of the latch and of the bolt. 
Therefore, if the strike lock is actuated, door B opens and 
door A opens as well. In known locks there is the drawback that the release  
 
pushbutton can be accessed from the outside, so that it is 
relatively easy to open it, with a suitable tool, in order 
to unlawfully open the strike lock. The technical aim of the present invention is to 
provide a bolt including a release mechanism that is 
designed so that it can be activated only when the bolt is 
inserted in the respective selvage of the strike lock, so 
as to ensure maximum security against break-in attempts. With the above aim in view, the invention provides a 
bolt for a lock, particularly of the panic-safe type, which 
is installed in one door of a double door and is 
operatively associated with a strike lock installed in the 
other door, characterized in that it comprises a flat 
sliding plate accommodated in a seat of the bolt and 
guided, against the biasing action of elastic transmission 
means, at right angles to the sliding direction of said 
bolt, said sliding plate having a lug for abutment against 
a fixed element of the lock when the bolt is engaged in the 
strike lock, a slider

<CLAIMS>
Bolt for a lock, particularly of the panic-safe 
type, which is installed in one door of a double door and 

is operatively associated with a strike lock installed in 
the other door, characterized in that it comprises a flat 

sliding plate (20) accommodated in a seat (10) of the bolt 
and guided, against the biasing action of elastic 

transmission means (17), at right angles to the sliding 
direction of said bolt, said sliding plate having a lug 

(30) suitable to abut against a fixed element (4) of the 
lock when the bolt is engaged in the strike lock, a slider 

(35) being furthermore provided which is guided in said 
bolt parallel to the sliding direction of said bolt and has 

a tang (38) protruding frontally from the bolt, said slider 
(35) cooperating with said sliding plate (20) so that when 

the bolt is engaged within the strike lock, the release 
action produced on the tang (38) by means of the strike 

lock causes the slider (35) to move the sliding plate (20) 
into a position in which said lug (30) does not abut 

against said fixed element (4), allowing retraction of the 
bolt (3) into the lock due to the release action. 
Bolt according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said sliding plate (20) has a slot (26) which is open on 

the rear edge of the bolt (3) and has an upper side (27) 
from which a lug (30) protrudes, said lug forming two 

opposite steps (32, 33) suitable to abut against a plate 
(4) which is fixed in the lock and is guided through a 

notch (7) of the bolt which is parallel to the sliding 
direction thereof, said bolt (3) having a seat (16) for  

 
accommodating a spring (17) which acts on said sliding 

plate (20) so as to make it rest with said upper side (27) 
on said plate (4) in the position in which it abuts against 

said steps (32, 33) and retains the bolt. 
Bolt according to claim 2, characterized in that 
said slider (35) has a slot (40) forming an inclined edge 

(41) and engaged by a pin (42) protruding laterally from 
said sliding plate (20), said inclined edge (41) being 

suitable to act on said pin (42) when said tang (38) is 
pushed into the bolt (3) so as to lift the sliding plate 

(20) into a position in which said lug (30) disengages from 
said plate (4) to allow the retraction of the bolt into the 

lock, said spring (17) being suitable to lower the sliding 
plate (20) into the position for engagement on said plate 

(4) and for retention of the bolt after the lug (30) has 
passed beyond said plate (4). 
Bolt according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said slider is constituted by a plate 

(35) which is guided in a seat (34) that lies laterally to 
the seat (10) for the accommodation of the sliding plate 

(20), and in that said tang (38) has a hemispherical end 
protruding from the front edge of the bolt.
