<ABSTRACT>
2-substituted-1-naphthols when coupled with an oxidation dye 
precursor in an oxidative dye system produce a long lasting 

intense color to hair. Use of such couplers makes available to 
the colorist novel oxidation hair dyes which surprisingly show a 

color shift to the red. Dyestuffs prepared through use of the 2-substituted-1-naphthol 
couplers are substantially more acid-fast 

compared to like dyestuffs using a 1-naphthol coupler. 
Compositions and a method of dyeing hair are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
Three classes of components are important in oxidative
hair dyeing: oxidation dye precursors, oxidants, and couplers.The oxidation dye precursor can be a primary
intermediate such as a difunctional benzene derivative capable of
being oxidized with resultant development of color, e.g. ortho- and
para-phenylenediamines and para-aminophenols, or a
hydroxyindole such as 5,6-dihydroxyindole.Hydrogen peroxide is the usual oxidant, although
persalts of various acids or solid organic peroxide adducts may
be employed, especially where a solid oxidant is desired.The third component type-the coupler-is important in
hair coloring to produce color nuances necessary for the
simulation of a natural hair color.It is well known that the shade or color produced by a
color coupler depends on its chemical nature.The production of red shades has always been a problem
in the development of lines of oxidative hair colorants. This
was due to the absence of true "red couplers" among the various
dye precursors. The problem was first overcome by the use of
direct dyes in admixture with the oxidative dye precursors. In
particular, 2,5-diaminonitrobenzene was widely used for this
purpose. Moreover, the red direct dyes exhibit very poor wash
fastness particularly on hair which had been previously subjected
to permanent waving or relaxing. In consequence, the red shades
so produced rapidly become drab brown after as little as one or
two shampooings.An attempt to improve the lastingness of red shades was
the subject of U.S. patent 3,210,252 which disclosed the use of
p-aminophenol and 5-amino-2-methylphenol and of U.S. patent
4,065,255 directed to the use of p-aminophenol and 5-(Î²-hydroxyethyl) 
amino-2-methylphenol to produce red shades by an
oxidative method. While these couples represent an improvement
over the use of direct dyes, they still suffer from less than
optimal light and wash fastness in oxidative dye compositions.Furthermore, these couples produce an orange-red when
coupled with p-aminophenol and a magenta when coupled with p-phenylenediamine
and, when used in combination with both p-aminophenol
and p-phenylenediamine, a dull hue is obtained.Moreover, in alkaline dyeing formulations the couples
are actually a vivid violet color due to ionization of the
phenolic group. It is only after shampooing and the consequent
drop in pH that the red color is evident. This has a very
disconcerting effect on the dye user, as evidenced by calls to
the manufacturers from consumers and hairdressers.A second method to produce red shades
