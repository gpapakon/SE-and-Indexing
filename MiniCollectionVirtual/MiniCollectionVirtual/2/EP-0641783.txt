<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
preparing a 1,2-pyrazolidine-4-yl-disulfide compound 
represented by the following formula: 
   wherein R¹ and R² are, independently each 
other, a hydrogen atom or an amino-protecting 
group,
 
which is a useful intermediate for producing 6,7-dihydro-6-mercapto-5H-pyrazolo[1,2-a][1,2,4]triazolium. Heretofore, there have been proposed carbapenem 
antibiotics which possess potent antimicrobial activity 
with a broad spectrum, and they have been used in clinical 
practice. For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication 
No. 230,286/1992 discloses (1R,5S,6S)-2-[(6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrazolo[1,2-a][1,2,4]triazolium-6-yl)]thio-6-[(R)-1-hydroxyethyl]-1-methyl-carbapenem-3-carboxylate 
as one of such carbapenem compounds. This carbapenem compound may be prepared by 
using a mercapto reagent, 6,7-dihydro-6-mercapto-5H-pyrazolo[1,2-a][1,2,4]triazolium 
derivative of the 
following formula: 
   wherein X⁻ is an anion charge.
 
In the above patent publication, this mercapto reagent 
is prepared by the following Reaction Scheme [A]. 
In the Reaction Scheme [A], the only process for 
preparing the starting disulfide compound of the formula 
(IIa) is disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent 
Publication No. 230,267/1992. The following Reaction 
Scheme [B] shows the process. 
   wherein R³ is bromine atom.
 
However, the process comprises as many as four reaction 
steps from the starting compound, that is, 1) thioacetylation, 
2) hydrolysis, 3) oxidation, and 4) deprotection. 
Furthermore, the second reaction step gives rise to a 
thiol compound, which causes irritant bad odor. In view  
 
of these disadvantages, there has been a demand for 
another process for preparing the compound of formula 
(IIa) which would be preferable and suitable for the 
purpose of commercial-scale production. The present invention provides a novel and 
improved simple process for preparing a 1,2-pyrazolidine-4-yl-disulfide 
compound which is a key starting compound 
for the preparation of 6,7-dihydro-6-mercapto-5H-pyrazolo 
[1,2-a][1,2,4]triazolium as shown above. In accordance with the invention, there is 
provided a process for preparing a 1,2-pyrazolidine-4-yl-disulfide 
compound represented by the following formula: 
   wherein R¹ and R² are, independently each 
other, a hydrogen atom or an amino-protecting 
group,
 
which comprises reacting a compound of the formula: 
   wherein R³ is an acid anion residue group, and
 
   R¹ and R² have the same meanings as above, 
with a disulfide compound
