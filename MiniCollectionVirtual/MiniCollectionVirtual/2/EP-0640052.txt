<ABSTRACT>
Propulsion unit for marine vessels with a gear or bearing housing (6) in which a propeller shaft (7) with a surface-breaking propeller (8) is carried. In a horizontal plane the propeller shaft forms an angle ( alpha ) to a guide fin (9) so as to create a resultant force (R) of the pressure force (P) of the propeller and the side force (S), with the resultant force being aligned with the longitudinal direction (CL) when the vessel is travelling straight ahead.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a propulsion unit for 
marine vessels, the unit comprising a housing connected 
to the hull of the vessel and the housing incorporating 
a propeller shaft provided with a surface-breaking 
propeller. Until now, known propulsion units of this type, whether 
they be purely outboard motors or so called inboard 
propulsion units with totally submerged or surface-breaking 
propellers, have had propeller shafts which, 
when the boat is travelling straight ahead, have been 
aligned with the longitudinal extension of the boat. In 
other words, the propeller shaft has always been parallel 
to the usual steer fin on outboard motors and inboard 
propulsion units. When powered by surface-breaking propellers, water is 
accelerated both in the axial direction and sideways, 
whereby the sideways forces generated by the sideways 
acceleration in previously known propulsion units has 
solely resulted in pure losses of kinetic energy, which 
is comparable with the rotation of the slip stream in 
conventional propellers. The resultant of the propeller 
pressure force in the longitudinal direction and the 
sideways force can, when large sideways forces are 
present, deviate so much from the longitudinal direction 
that it has been necessary to compensate for this by 
setting the rudder of the vessel (with fixed drive 
units), or the entire propulsion unit (with simple 
steerable units), at an angle, with consequential 
increase in the flow resistance. In twin installations, 
the counter-rotating propellers do not require any 
oblique setting of the propulsion unit or rudder since 
the side forces act in opposite direction and do not  
 
generate any steering forces, though the losses remain 
and the side forces must be taken up in steering 
components, tie-rods and suspension members. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
propulsion unit of the previously mentioned type in which 
the above mentioned losses and the loading of, for 
example, the tie-rod arrangements and associated 
components can be eliminated. This is achieved in accordance with the present invention 
in a manner such that, in the horizontal plane, the 
propeller shaft forms an angle to a vertical plane of 
symmetry of a flow-control body connected to, or integral 
with, said housing, said body being intended to be 
aligned with the longitudinal extension of the vessel 
when the vessel is travelling in a straight line. With 
steerable propulsion units having a steer fin, the 
propeller shaft is angled
