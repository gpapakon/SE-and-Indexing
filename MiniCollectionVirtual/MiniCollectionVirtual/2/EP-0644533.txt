An artifact (2) is used in a computer memory disk system. A 
method using the artifact (2), and a device incorporating 

the method is also included. The artifact (2), preferably 
implemented as an annulus concentric with the center of a 

rotatable element of the computer memory disk system, provides 
a signal when illuminated by an external laser beam 

(14; 84, 85) and then detected using laser techniques. 
Preferably, the rotatable element is a hard disk of the 

computer memory disk system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This is an invention to generate a clock signal used in 
conjunction with the writing of servo-tracks on magnetic 
hard disks used as mass storage devices in computers. The 
servo-track writing process requires two separate functions: 
first, the positioning of the read/write head at the desired 
radial position on the hard disk; and, second, the 
synchronization of the writing of data on the servo-track 
with the angular position of the rotating hard disk. The 
current invention addresses the second of these 
requirements. An artifact, in the form of a scale, or coarse 
diffraction grating, is used in the generation of a master 
clock signal used during the servo-track writing operation, 
which includes an establishment of a sector mark every n 
degrees of rotation of the disk, where 360/n is an integer. An artifact, when provided as an annulus concentric 
with the center of the disk, provides a master clock signal 
when illuminated by an external laser beam and then detected  
 
using laser metrology techniques. The master clock signal is 
used to fix the location of sector marks on each track of 
the hard disk. Hard disk drives provided with optical windows to view 
a portion of the artifact are especially adaptable to use of 
these artifacts, this apparatus, and the method of this 
invention. The invention described herein allows the clock signal 
generation to be performed without contact of the measuring 
system with the artifact. By using ports or windows in the 
housing of the computer memories which are transparent to 
the radiation used to create the interference pattern, the 
current invention allows the clock signal generation to be 
performed after the housing has been sealed, and without the 
need to reopen the housing. An essential element of the modern computer, including 
the personal computer, is a mass-storage device. Unlike the random access memory (RAM) which holds the 
data which is being immediately accessed by the computer, 
the mass-storage device holds data not currently being used, 
as well as programs not currently needed. One of the most widely-used mass-storage devices used 
today is the so-called hard disk drive (HDD). The heart of 
this device is a disk, or platter, coated, often on both  
 
sides, with a magnetic surface, upon which information may 
be repeatedly written and read. Such disk drives may contain a single platter having a 
diameter of two inches or less, with storage capacities of 
20 megabytes (twenty million bytes, each byte containing 
eight bits, and
