<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a process for the preparation of liquid 
organic compounds, suitable as base materials for lubricants, 

comprising contacting one of more alpha-olefins containing 8 to 20 
carbon atoms per molecule, under oligomerisation conditions with a 

catalyst composition based on 

a) a Group IV A metal compound of the general formula (Cp)₂ MeX₂, 
wherein Cp represents a cyclopentadienyl group, Me represents a 

Group IV A metal and each X independently represents a moiety 
selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbyl groups, 

hydrocarboxy groups, hydrocarbamido groups, each of which may be 
optionally substituted, hydrogen atoms and halogen atoms and 
b) a substantially non-coordinating anion source;
 

and optionally subjecting the oligomers formed to an addition 
reaction to reduce their olefinic unsaturation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for preparing liquid 
organic compounds, suitable as base materials for lubricants, which 
process involves a catalytic oligomerisation reaction. It is known that oligomers of propylene may be used as base 
materials for preparing lubricating oils. As is apparent from some 
earlier publications, propylene oligomers with a polymerisation 
degree of mainly 2 to 10 and containing vinyl-end groups, have been 
considered of particular interest. For example, in EP-A-268 214, 
propylene oligomers having a polymerisation degree of mainly 2 to 
10 and containing vinyl end-groups are prepared in high selectivity 
by oligomerising propylene in the presence of a catalyst comprising 
a transition metal compound and an organometallic compound, wherein 
an alkyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl compound of zirconium and/or 
an alkyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl compound of hafnium is used 
as the transition metal compound, and a condensation product of an 
organoaluminium compound and water is used as the organometallic 
compound. The transition metal compound may be represented by the 
formula

(R₅C₅)m M X4-m   (I)


 
wherein R represents a C₁-C₂₀ alkyl group, R₅C₅ represents a 
cyclopentadienyl group substituted with an alkyl group, M 
represents a zirconium or hafnium atom, X represents a hydrogen or 
halogen atom, or a C₁-C₂₀ alkyl group, and m represents an integer 
from 2 to 4. The organometallic compound is exemplified by 
methylaluminoxane, ethylaluminoxane, propylaluminoxane, 
isopropylaluminoxane, butylaluminoxane, isobutylaluminoxane and 
amylaluminoxane.  In Table 1 on Page 8 of EP-A-268 214, the results are shown of 
a comparative experiment (Comparative Example 1) in which the 
catalyst used contained an unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl zirconium 
compound, i.e. bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride, as the 
transition metal compound and methylaluminoxane as the 
organometallic compound. It will be seen from Table 1 that a 
polymerisation degree of 41.9 was obtained using this catalyst. 
Although no data is given on the selectivity of the catalyst with 
respect to vinyl and vinylidene end-groups (in contrast to the 
catalysts of Examples 1 to 18 which contained a transition metal 
compound of formula I above), it is stated in the text at Page 7, 
lines 6 to 8 that in the comparative examples, polymerisation 
reaction took place preferentially to oligomerisation reaction and 
product were all high polymers which predominantly had vinylidene 
group as terminal unsaturated
