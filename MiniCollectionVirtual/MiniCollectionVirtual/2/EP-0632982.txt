<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a lying surface in the manner of a slatted base in which at least two elastic bodies (15, 16) are arranged between two parallel layers (5, 6) of slats to achieve a resilience of the lying surface, it is proposed to provide a third level (4) of slats in the middle between the slats already present in order to be able to use this lying surface also for high loads with heavy body weights and to obtain a favourable pressure distribution.

Lying surface in the manner of a slatted base 
with an upper, middle and lower layer of slats (22, 23, 

21), each having slats (6, 4, 5) which are parallel to 
one another and are spaced apart from one another, 

elastic bodies (7, 8, 9) being connected, which run 
between the individual layers of slats (22, 23, 21) in 

each case at a mutual distance perpendicular to the slats 
(6, 4, 5) and have straps (32) on their underside and top 

side for fastening the end faces of the slats (4) or the 
middle layer of slats (23), characterized in that only 

every second slat (4) is inserted in the middle layer of 
slats (23), the slats (4) being arranged only in longitudinal 

regions with high compression loading, namely in 
the bed supporting region of the shoulder and pelvis, 

offset relative to the slats (5) of the lower layer of 
slats (21). 
Lying surface according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the spacing of the slats (5) of the lower layer 

of slats (21) is intended to be different, the slats (5) 
in the region of high compression stress of the bed, such 

as for example the supporting region of the shoulder, 
back and pelvis, lying closer together than the slats (5) 

in the supporting region of the head and the feet. 
Lying surface according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the thickness of the slats (4) of the 

middle layer of slats (23) is less than that of the slats 
(5, 6) of the lower and upper layers of slats (21, 22). 
Lying surface according to one of Claims 1-3, 
characterized in that wider slats (5) are used in the  

 
middle layer of slats (23) than in the upper and lower 

layers of slats (22, 21). 
Lying surface according to one of Claims 1-4, 
characterized in that the spacing of the middle layer of 

slats (23) is intended to be different from the lower 
layer of slats (21) and the upper layer of slats (22). 
Lying surface according to one of Claims 1-5, 
characterized in that recesses are formed in the elastic 

body (7), in which recesses the slats (4) engage with 
their end faces and are held there. 
Lying surface according to one of Claims 1-6, 
characterized in that a horizontal separating plane (33) 

is provided in the longitudinal direction in the elastic 
body (7), which separating plane separates the elastic 

body (7) into an upper and lower part, and in that the 
two parts, each wrapped in a covering, are configured as 

individual padded bodies (15, 16), at least one padded 
body (15) having straps (32) on the side facing the 

separating plane (33) for holding the slats (4) of the 
middle layer of slats (23), and in that the padded bodies 

(15, 16) are connected to one another at least in 
sections along the edges adjoining the separating plane 

(33). 
Lying surface according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the elastic bodies (7, 8, 9) consist of three 

padded bodies (15, 16) which are arranged successively in 
a row and are connected to one another at the mutually 

facing end faces, the layer of slats (23) being fastened 
additionally in the middle padded body (8). 
Lying surface according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the elastic bodies (7, 8, 9) are configured as 

individual padded bodies (15, 16), each padded body (15, 
16) being connected on mutually opposite sides in each 

case to a slat (6, 5) of the upper layer (22) and lower 
layer (21) of slats. 
Lying surface according to Claim 9, characterized 
in that the padded bodies (15, 16) are configured as 

latex balls, a central recess for holding the slats (4) 
being formed in each case in the latex balls.
