<ABSTRACT>
A bandsaw (1), in particular a butcher bandsaw, is proposed. The bandsaw (1) has an underframe (2) with saw table (3), a drive motor (5) with bottom drive wheel (4), dirt wipers (25, 26) for the revolving, band-shaped saw blade (10) and the drive wheel, and a tensioning and slackening device (SSV) for the saw blade, with which the drive motor together with drive wheel and motor bearing plate can be moved in the vertical direction, and also a column and a saw head which adjoins the column at the top and on which the top deflecting wheel for the saw blade is mounted. In order to permit easy and quick dismantling and fitting of saw blade and wipers, provision is made for the wiper (25a, 25b) allocated to the saw blade and the wheel wiper (26) to be operable by driver elements (27), allocated to these wipers, of a lifting and setting device (SAV), and for the lifting and setting device and the tensioning and slackening device for the saw blade to be coupled to one another in such a way that they can be operated together with a single actuating lever (6) of the tensioning and slackening device for the saw blade.

<CLAIMS>
A band saw (1), in particular a butcher's band saw,
having a substructure (2) with a sawing table (3), a

driving motor (5) with lower driving wheel (4), waste
strippers for the rotating band-shaped saw blade (10) and

the driving wheel (4), and also a saw blade clamping and
unclamping device (SSV), with which the driving motor (5)

together with driving wheel (4) and motor bearing bracket
(13) can be moved in the vertical direction, and also

with a column (7) and a saw head (8) attached to the top
of said column, on which the upper deflection wheel (9)

for the saw blade (10) is mounted, with the saw blade
clamping and unclamping device (SSV) and a waste stripper

lifting and adjustment device (SAV) being coupled to one
another in such a manner that they can be jointly

operated with a single operating lever (6) of the saw
blade clamping and unclamping device (SSV),
characterised in that
 the waste stripper lifting and
adjustment device (SAV) comprises driving elements (27),

which are associated with the stripper (25a, b)
associated with the saw blade (10) and with the wheel

stripper (26),
and in that
 the driving elements (27) are disposed on a
plate-shaped crosshead (24) of the waste stripper lifting

and adjustment device (SAV), with the plate-shaped
crosshead (24) of the waste stripper lifting and

adjustment device (SAV) being connected to the motor
bearing bracket (13).
A band saw according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the crosshead (24) and the motor
bearing bracket (13) are constructed in one piece. 
A band saw according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 at least one saw blade stripper
(25a, b) is provided for each side of the saw blade (10).
A band saw according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 the saw blade strippers (25a, b)
and the wheel stripper (26) are placed by their hubs

(31), provided with bores flattened on either side, in a
form-fit and consequently torsion-free manner on a

bearing pin (32), correspondingly flattened on either
side, with the bearings being secured in the axial

direction by easily detachable catch connections (40).
A band saw according to Claim 4,
characterised in that
 the bearing pins (32) are bearing
flange pins.
A band saw according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that
 the bearing pins (32) are in each
case mounted in plastics bearing bushes (33), with a

driving lever (29) in each case being fixed in a bore
(35) at the rear end (34) of the bearing pins (32), which

lever at the same time serves to axially fix the bearing
pin (32), with the driving levers (29) being spring

loaded.
A band saw according to Claim 6,
characterised in that
 the plastics bearing bushes (33)
abut the front side of a front wall (12) of the

substructure (2) by their respective shoulders (36) and
are axially fixed and secured by a U-shaped sheet (38)

engaging in a groove (37) of the bearing bush (33), which
sheet is supported via two forcing set screws (39)

against the rear of the front wall (12). 
A band saw according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that
 stripper lips (41), which, in
relation to the longitudinal direction (X) of the

rotating saw blade (10), are inclined in an angular
range of α = 40 to 70°, are provided on the saw

blade strippers (25a, b).
A band saw according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that
 stripper lips (41), which, in
relation to the longitudinal direction (X) of the

rotating saw blade (10), are inclined at an angle of
α = 55°, are provided on the saw blade strippers

(25a, b).
A band saw according to one of Claims 5 to 9,
characterised in that
 by moving the operating lever
(6) in the anti-clockwise direction and the raising

of the strippers (25a, b; 26) simultaneously
effected hereby, the saw blade (10) is released and

can be removed from the driving wheel (4) and from
the deflection wheel (9), and also the strippe
rs
(25a, b; 26) can be pulled off the bearing pin (32).
A band saw according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that
 by moving the operating lever
(6) in the clockwise direction the saw blade (10) is

clamped and at the same time the strippers (25a, b;
26) are resiliently placed against the saw blade

(10) and respectively against the driving wheel (4)
with a bias corresponding to the tension springs

(28).
