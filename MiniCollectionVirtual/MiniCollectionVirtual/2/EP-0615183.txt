<ABSTRACT>
The terminal according to the invention comprises a small-sized tactile screen (2) possessing the resources required to depict images representing those of the system's visual display elements, and in doing so, regardless of their format, resolution or content, these images defining sensitive areas (Z1 to Z5) which the operator can designate to the system through a manual action of the means allowing the transmission to the system of an information item corresponding with the area designated by the operator, means (4) allowing validation of the area designated by the operator, and means (3) allowing selection of the abovementioned images. The invention applies in particular to the equipping of the controls for piloting an aerodyne.

<CLAIMS>
A computer system comprising at least a
processor, plural viewing elements (VISU1, VISU2 ...

VISUn) and a terminal enabling dialogue between an
operator and the computer system, characterized in that

the terminal comprises a touch-sensitive screen of
reduced dimensions having the resources required to

display images representative of those of said viewing
elements, irrespective of their format, resolution or

content, said images defining sensitive areas (Z1 to
Z5) that said operator can designate to the system

through manual action, a means enabling transmission to
said system of information corresponding to the area

designated by said operator, a means (16) enabling
validation of said area designated by said operator,

and a means (3) enabling selection of the above-mentioned
images.
The computer system as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that the sensitive areas (Z1 to Z5)

are associated with functions such as commands, entries
or parameter incrementations, and comprise inscriptions

indicating their nature, function, and/or the parameter
to be modified, as the case may be.
The computer system as claimed in one of
claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the terminal

comprises a means enabling the selection of one or more
images distinct from those of the viewing elements, in

order to enable the operator to engage in direct

dialogue with the system or even with said terminal
alone, independently of said system.
The computer system as claimed in one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the terminal

comprises a touch-sensitive surface (15) mounted on an
effort detection device (16) which provides at least

one identification signal as a function of the effort 
and which enables identification of the exceeding of

different thresholds by said efforts.
The computer system as claimed in one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the terminal

connected to the different viewing elements (VISU1 ...
VISUn) via a control bus (BC) and a multiplicity of

image busses (B1 to Bn), at the rate of one image bus
(B1 ... Bn) per viewing element (VISU1 ... VISUn).
The computer system as claimed in claim 5,
characterized in that each viewing element (VISU1 ...

VISUn) comprises a circuit (10) for elaborating
standardized data connected to a transmitting circuit

(6) on one of the image busses (B1 ...Bn) via a
compressing circuit (7).
The computer system as claimed in claim 5 or
6, characterized in that the terminal comprises a

touch-sensitive surface (15) mounted on the effort
detector (16) which provides at least an identification

signal as a function of the effort, and which enables
identification of the exceeding of different thresholds

by said efforts, and a microprocessor-based processing
unit (12) which receives information relating to the

activation status of the touch-sensitive surface (15),
the effort detector (16) and the selection and

validation means (3, 4), said processing unit (12)
piloting an image data processing chain which comprises

an input bus selector (17) connected to the image data
busses (B1, B2, Bn), a decompressing circuit to

decompress the image data from the selected bus (18), a
first programmable sequencer (19) for the storage of

image data in a memory (20) and a second programmable
sequencer (21) which reads the data in said memory (20)

and manages the presentation of the image on said
screen (2). 
The computer system as claimed in claim 7,
characterized in that said processing unit (12) is

connected to the control bus (BC) via an adapter (22)
in order to transmit to a viewing element selected the

information entered by the operator via the touch-sensitive
surface (15).
The computer system as claimed in claim 7 or
8, characterized in that said processing unit (12) is

associated with a memory (20) assigned to programs
relating to specific modes of said terminal which can

be selected by means of said selection means (3).
The computer system as claimed in claim 7,
characterized in that, once the selection has been made

via the selection means (3), the first programmable
sequencer (19) receives, from the processing unit,

logic initializing equations corresponding to the data
storage processings to be performed in the memory (20).
The computer system as claimed in one of
claims 7 and 10, characterized in that the second

programmable sequencer (21) receives from the
processing unit (12) logic initializing equations

corresponding to the data retrieval processings to be
performed from the memory (20), enabling performance of

the specific formatting operations concerning the image
presented on the screen (2).
The computer system as claimed in one of
claims 7 to 11, characterized in that the touch-sensitive

surface (15) associated with its effort
detector (16) enables a distinction to be made between

a clear-cut pressing of a selection and a light
touching thereof.
The computer system as claimed in claim 12,
characterized in that a localized light touching is

interpreted by the processing unit (12) as a zoom-in
command concerning the activated zone, without any 

effect on the viewing element selected by the selection
means (3).
The computer system as claimed in claim 12 or
13, characterized in that a clear-cut pressing on a

zone is interpreted by the processing unit (12) as a
system type command, with effect on the viewing element

selected.
The computer system as claimed in one of
claims 12 to 14, characterized in that a broad light

touching, such as a transversal sweeping of the entire
screen, is interpreted by the processing unit (12) as a

zoom-out command, without effect on the viewing element
selected.
