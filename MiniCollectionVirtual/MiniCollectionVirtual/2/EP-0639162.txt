<CLAIMS>
A process for the destruction of harmful substances in 
waste waters wherein the waste water stream to be treated 

passes the following process steps in sequence: 

treatment of the waste water stream with hydrogen 
peroxide (H
2
O
2
) with simultaneous irradiation with UV 
light; 
treatment with a reductive agent, such as sodium 
dithionite; 
precipitation of any harmful metallic substances, 
optionally followed by a filtration and/or treatment 

with a selective ion-exchanger. 
The process according to claim 1 wherein a pretreatment 
step is preliminarily performed in which hydrogen peroxide 

is discontinuously added to the waste water. 
The process according to claim 1 and/or 2 wherein UV light 
having a wavelength of from 185 to 400 nm is used. 
The process according to at least one of claims 1 to 3 
wherein the UV radiators emitting the UV light give off a 

minimum power density of 40 W/cm, based on the electric 
power consumption. 
The process according to at least one of claims 1 to 4 
wherein said precipitation of the metals is performed in 

the form of hydroxide compounds.  
 
The process according to at least one of claims 1 to 5 
wherein the treatment of cyanide-containing waste waters is 

in addition performed with persulfates. 
The process according to at least one of claims 1 to 6 
wherein detoxification of the waste water from free and 

complex cyanides is performed in the first step. 
The process according to at least one of claims 1 to 7 
wherein chromate is reduced with sodium dithionite in the 

second step. 
A device for performing the process according to at least 
one of claims 1 to 8 comprising a reaction vessel (1), a UV 

irradiation reactor (2) connected therewith via inlet and 
outlet lines, at least one receptor (11) for the waste 

water to be treated, storage container for hydrogen peroxide 
(13), storage container for reductive agent (22), 

wherein containers (11, 13, 22) are connected through lines 
with reaction vessel (1).
