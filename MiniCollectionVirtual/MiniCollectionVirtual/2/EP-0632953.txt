<ABSTRACT>
A soil-working machine, especially a seed drill 2, which can be mounted on a tractor 2 has a frame 3 and a plurality of soil-working implements 9, 39 mounted on the frame. A four-axle link arrangement with parallel-liftable lower links 26 of the tractor 2 and with a pivotable upper link 27 arranged above them is provided between the frame 3 and the tractor 2. A force transmitter 30 engaging on the four-axle link arrangement generates a return force between the tractor 2 and the frame 3, the said return force loading the frame 3 downwards.

<CLAIMS>
A soil working machine attachable to a tractor (1),
particularly a sowing machine (2), the machine comprising: a

frame (3), and soil working tools which are supported by the
frame and which are upwardly swivelling as singles or in groups;

a four axes-swinging arm-arrangement with lower swinging arms
(8), which belong to the tractor (1) and which are liftable in

parallel, and with a swivelling upper swinging arm (7), which is
arranged above the lower swinging arms, being provided between

the frame (3) and the tractor (1); a hydraulic cylinder (30),
which engages the four axes-swinging arm-arrangement, creating

a restoring force between the tractor (1) and the frame (3),
which acts upon the frame (3) in a downward direction, and being

connected to a gas-filled pressure reservoir (21); and further
hydraulic cylinders (15), which act between the frame (3) and

the soil working tools, being provided; 
characterized in that

the further hydraulic cylinders (15) acting between the frame
(3) and the soil working tools, create restoring forces between

the frame (3) and the soil working tools, which act upon the
soil working tools in a downward direction, and are connected to

the same pressure reservoir (21) as the hydraulic cylinder (30)
engaging the four axes-swinging arm-arrangement.
The soil working machine according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 the soil working tools are supported by
the frame (3) by means of parallelogram-swinging arm-arrangements

(7, 8) which are engaged by the hydraulic cylinders
(15).
The soil working machine according to claim 2,

characterized in that
 the hydraulic cylinders (15) engaging the
parallelogram-swinging arm-arrangements (7, 8) engage, on the 

one hand, the respective upper swinging arms (7) and, on the
other hand, the soil working tools; the point of engagement of

the hydraulic cylinders (15) at the soil working tools being in
front of a plane which is defined by the swivel axes between the

upper swinging arms (7) and the soil working tools and between
the respective lower swinging arms (8) and the soil working

tools.
The soil working machine according to claim 1,

characterized in that
, in the operation position of the soil
working machine, the gas volume of the pressure reservoir (21)

is at least four times the total volume which is displacable by
all hydraulic cylinders (15, 30).
The soil working machine according to claim 1 or 4,

characterized in that
 the pressure reservoir (21) is loadable
with pressure by means of a hydraulic installation (37) of the

tractor (2) and lockable with regard to the hydraulic
installation (37).
The soil working machine according to claim 5,

characterized in that
 the pressure reservoir (21) is designed
for an operation pressure of 30 to 300 bar, a pressure gauge

(35) indicating the operation pressure.
The soil working machine according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 the hydraulic cylinder (30), on the one
hand, engages the frame (3) and, on the other hand, engages one

lever arm (31) of a force transfer lever (30, 31) of first
class; the force transfer lever (31, 32) swivelling about the

swivel axis (23) between the frame (3) and the lower swinging
arms (26) of the tractor (2), and, with its other lever arm

(32), supporting itself on the lower swinging arms (26).
