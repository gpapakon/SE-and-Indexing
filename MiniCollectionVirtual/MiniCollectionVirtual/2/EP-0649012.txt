A sensor for measuring changes in viscosity
and/or density in a test fluid, in particular for

measuring the coagulation of blood, having a housing
which surrounds a measuring chamber in which a

piezoelectric element, in particular a quartz crystal
constructed as a shear-mode transducer, is arranged, as

an oscillating circuit, a measuring surface of which is
wetted with the test fluid and a reaction component,

and changes in the oscillating circuit parameters are
evaluated by a corresponding electronic evaluation

circuit, wherein the sensor (10, 20, 30, 40) is
constructed as a disposable part in which the reaction

component is accommodated inside the measuring chamber
(7) in the vicinity of the measuring surface (18) of

the piezoelectric element (8), but not yet in contact
with said surface, in such a way that upon being

introduced via an access (11) the test fluid comes into
contact with the reaction component and with the

measuring surface (18) of the piezoelectric element
(8).
The sensor as claimed in claim 1, wherein it is
assembled, in particular glued together, like a

sandwich from a plurality of layers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
The sensor as claimed in claim 2, wherein the
housing comprises five layers (1-5), specifically


a first layer (1) forming a closed bottom,
a second layer (2), which leaves a free space
under the piezoelectric element (8), 
a third layer (3), which holds the piezoelectric
element (8),
a fourth layer (4), which forms the measuring
chamber (7) above the piezoelectric element (8),

and
a fifth layer (5), which, as a lid, exposes the

measuring chamber (7) above the piezoelectric
element (8), and has an access (11) for filling

the test fluid into the measuring chamber (7).
The sensor as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
housing comprises two assembled, in particular glued

together, housing shells (21, 22) into which the
piezoelectric element (8) is inserted.
The sensor as claimed in claim 4, wherein the
piezoelectric element (8) is inserted, in particular

glued, into one housing shell (22) which has the access
(11), into a corresponding recess (29), and in that the

other housing shell (21), which forms the bottom, has a
projecting section (23) which rests on the edge of the

piezoelectric element (8).
The sensor as claimed in claim 4, wherein the
piezoelectric element (8) is arranged on a substrate

part (33) which is mounted between the two housing
shells (31, 32).
The sensor as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
housing (41) is constructed in one piece with a chamber

(49) accessible from outside, and in that a substrate
(13), carrying the reaction component, and the

piezoelectric element (8) are inserted into this
chamber (49) via an introduction conduit (47), and

preferably glued.
The sensor as claimed in one of claims 5 to 7,
wherein the housing shells (21, 22; 31, 32) and/or the

housing (41) are made from injection-molded plastic.
The sensor as claimed in one of claims 1 to 8,
wherein the access for introducing the test fluid

comprises a bore (11) connected to the measuring
chamber (7). 
The sensor as claimed in one of claims 1 to 8,
wherein the access for introducing the test fluid

comprises a membrane covering the measuring chamber (7)
and permeable to the fluid.
The sensor as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6,
wherein the reaction component is applied to the walls

of the measuring chamber (7).
The sensor as claimed in one of claims 1 to 10,
wherein the reaction component is contained on a

substrate (13) which is inserted into the measuring
chamber (7) in such a way that it does not make contact

with the measuring surface (18).
The sensor as claimed in claim 12, wherein use
is made as substrate (13) of an absorbent pad made

from, for example, cotton wool or filter paper.
The sensor as claimed in claim 12, wherein use
is made as substrate (13) of a grid made from, for

example, plastic or metal.
The sensor as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, wherein the piezoelectric element (8) is held

in a substrate board (3; 33) and is connected to
terminal faces (16), led out of the housing, via

conductor tracks (15) printed onto the substrate board.
The sensor as claimed in one of claims 1 to 15,
which is constructed as a blood coagulation sensor,

wherein CaCl
2
 or other substances for influencing the
course of coagulation are provided as reaction

component.
The sensor as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, wherein it is provided with a device for

temperature control in order to keep the temperature at
a constant value.
A measuring arrangement having a sensor as
claimed in one of the preceding claims, wherein it
