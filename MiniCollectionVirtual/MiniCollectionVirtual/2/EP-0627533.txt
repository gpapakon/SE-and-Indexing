<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an awning having an awning-canvas reel (2) which is retained rotatably between two bearing cheeks (3) and is intended for an awning canvas, in each case one bearing cheek (3) being fixed at one end of a carrying rod (5). The carrying rod (5) extends over the length of the awning-canvas reel (2) and bears extension arms (6) which, for their part, carry an opening-out rod (8) on which the awning canvas (1) is fixed, furthermore, a drive (20) for the awning-canvas reel (2) is provided. In order to arrange the drive (20) in a manner protected from weathering and in order not to have to demount the same in the event of the awning-canvas reel (2) being exchanged, provision is made for arranging the drive (20) in the carrying rod (5), which is designed as a hollow profile.

Sunshade with a fabric roller (2) held so that it is able
to rotate between two bearing cheeks (3), for a sunshade fabric

(1), in which case respectively one bearing cheek (3) is fixed
at one end (5a) of a support bar (5), which extends over the

length of the fabric roller (2), and with cantilever arms (6)
fastened to the support bar (5) for a drop-out bar (8), to which

the sunshade fabric (1) can be fixed, as well as a drive (20) for
the fabric roller (2), characterised in that the drive (20) is

located in the support bar (5) constructed as a hollow profile
and an output shaft (21) of the drive (20) penetrates the bearing

cheek (3) and supports an output wheel (22), which meshes with
a drive member (28) driving the fabric roller (2).
Sunshade according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
drive (20) is arranged adjacent to a bearing cheek (3) at the end

(5a) of the support bar (5).
Sunshade according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the output wheel (22) is a chain wheel and the drive member (28)

is a chain, which meshes with a drive wheel (24) of the fabric
roller.
Sunshade according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that the bearing cheek (3) forms a cover closing off the

hollow profile (5) on the end side.
Sunshade according to Claim 3 or 4, characterised in that
the output wheel (22) and the drive member (28) lie in a housing

(4) of the bearing cheek (3), which can be closed off by a cover.
Sunshade according to one of Claims 3 to 5, characterised
in that the output shaft (21) is part of mitre-wheel gearing

(50), whereof the input shaft (23) lies approximately
perpendicular to the base (5d) of the hollow profile (5), the

mitre-wheel gearing (50) preferably being held in the bearing 
cheek (3).
Sunshade according to Claim 7, characterised in that the
input shaft (23) is connected to a stop gear (30) preferably held

in the hollow profile (5) and/or to a braking device (40)
preferably held in the hollow profile (5).
Sunshade according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised
in that each cantilever arm (6) is connected to a hinged arm (7a)

of adjustable inclination of a hinge (7) held in the hollow
profile (5).
Sunshade according to Claim 8, characterised in that the
hinged arm (7a) able to tilt about a horizontal axis (7b) may

have its inclination adjusted by way of a vertical screw spindle
(70), which can be rotated by way of gearing (75) held in the

hollow profile (5) by a vertical drive shaft (23), in which case
preferably the screw spindle (70) and the gearing (75) lie one

beside the other.
Sunshade according to Claim 8 or 9, characterised in that
the cantilever arms (6) holding a drop-out bar (8) are adjustable

by way of a common drive shaft (23), in which case the drive
shaft (23) is rotatable manually by a driving eye (26) mounted

in the base (5d) of the hollow profile (5) or by an electric
motor (51) preferably located close to the base in the hollow

profile (5).
