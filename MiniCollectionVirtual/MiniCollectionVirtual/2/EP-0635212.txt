<ABSTRACT>
A sheet- or tube-like film based on cellulose hydrate is described which is preferably used as a food casing, particularly preferably as a sausage casing. In addition to cellulose hydrate, it contains a homopolymer having units of N-vinylpyrrolidone, N-vinylpyridone or N-vinylcaprolactam and/or a copolymer containing these units and additionally units of the formulae II and III.

 of 50,000
to 2,000,000, preferably of 100,000 to 1,500,000,

particularly preferably of 500,000 to 1,500,000.
The flat or tubular film as claimed in one or more
of claims 1 to 3, wherein the homo- and/or copolymer

is/are contained in an amount of 0.1 to 60 % by
weight, preferably 0.5 to 30 % by weight, particularly

preferably 0.5 to 5 % by weight, in each
case based on the weight of cellulose.
The film as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 4,
wherein the cellulose hydrate-based film additionally

contains alginic acid and/or alginate. 
The film as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 5,
wherein the cellulose hydrate-based film contains

alginic acid and/or alginate in an amount of 1 to
50 % by weight, based on the weight of cellulose.
The film as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 6,
wherein the cellulose hydrate-based film contains a

fiber reinforcement.
The film as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 7,
wherein the cellulose hydrate-based film has a

moisture content of 10 to 30 % by weight, based on
the weight of cellulose.

A process for the production of a film as claimed in
one or more of claims 1 to 9, which comprises adding

to the viscose solution, before the extrusion, an
agueous solution of the homo- and/or copolymer

mentioned in claim 1, extruding the resulting homogeneous
solution, coagulating it by the acidic

precipitation liquid and regenerating it.

1 to 10 as a packaging material, preferably for

food, particularly preferably for sausage products.
