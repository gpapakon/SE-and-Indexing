<CLAIMS>
A roller for an inking unit of a printing machine, the 
surface of the roller having hydrophilic and oleophilic surface 

portions, characterized in that the surface of the roller has a 
layer of a mixture of oleophilic metal and hydrophilic metal 

oxide which is applied by means of plasma spraying. 
A roller according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
oleophilic metal is copper.

A roller according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that 
the hydrophilic metal oxide is aluminium oxide. 
A roller according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that 
the hydrophilic metal oxide is zirconium oxide. 
A roller according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 
5% of the casing surface has an oleophilic surface portion. 
A process for manufacturing the roller according to Claims 
1 to 6, characterized in that first a mixture of oleophilic metal 

and hydrophilic metal oxide, for example Cr

, is sprayed onto 
a casing of the roller, which casing has a thin coating of non-ferrous 

metal, for example nickel, by means of plasma spraying, 
in that the casing surface of the sprayed-on layer is then 

ground, and in that a number of depressions are then introduced 
into this ground layer. 
A process according to Claim 7, characterized in that the 
mixture comprises particles of copper and aluminium oxide.  

 
A process according to Claim 7, characterized in that the 
mixture comprises particles of copper and zirconium oxide.
