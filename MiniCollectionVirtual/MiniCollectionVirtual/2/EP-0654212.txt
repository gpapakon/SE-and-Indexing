carrying means (12) disposed parralel to 
the scion seedling carrying means (11), 

and grafted seedling carrying means (13) 
disposed parralel to the root stock 

seedling carrying means (12), said 
apparatus further comprising a seedling 

grasping and moving mechanism (60) 
for picking scion seedlings and root stock 

seedlings from the scion 
seedling carrying means (11) and the root 

stock seedling carrying means (12) to 
move them at a predetermined position, the seedling grasping and moving 

mechanism (60) having upper seedling grasping means for 
grasping the upper 

portions of scion seedlings and root stock seedlings simultaneously, 
lower seedling grasping means for grasping the lower portions of scion 

seedlings and root stock seedlings simultaneously, means for moving the 
upper and lower seedling grasping means vertically, and means for moving 

the upper and lower seedling grasping means in a direction 
perpendicular to the seedling carrying direction; a seedling cutting 

mechanism (110) for cutting the scion and root stock 
seedlings grasped by the 

upper and lower seedling grasping means simultaneously; and a seedling 
jointing mechanism (130) for jointing the upper portions of the scion 

seedlings and the lower portions of the root stock seedlings each cut by

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for grafting seedlings wherein scion
seedlings and root stock seedlings are cut to joint the upper portions of the scion
seedlings and the lower portions of the root stock seedlings simultaneously.As the prior grafting apparatus wherein scion seedlings and root stock seedlings
are cut to joint the upper portions of the scion seedlings and the lower portions of
the root stock seedlings, apparatus as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application
Laid-Open Publications Nos. 2-107125, 4-187029 and 4-304817 are known.However, in these prior apparatuses, one scion seedling and one root stock
seedling are jointed by a clip sequentially, and thus, it is impossible to graft a plurality
of seedlings simultaneously.Further, in the apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication
No. 4-304817, a scion seedling carrying line and a root stock seedling carrying
line are disposed parallel to each other, and between the downstream ends of
these carrying lines, grasping means of scion and root stock seedlings, a seedling
cutting mechanism and a seedling jointing mechanism are disposed, and further, a
grafted seedling carrying line is located in a direction perpendicular to those two
lines. Furthermore, in the apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
Publication No. 4-187029, a scion seedling carrying line and a root stock
seedling carrying line are disposed parallel to each other, and between the downstream
ends of these carrying lines, grasping means of scion and root stock
seedlings, a seedling cutting mechanism, a seedling jointing mechanism and a securing
mechanism are disposed, and further, a grafted seedling carrying line is located
in a direction parallel to those two lines at a position downstream of these
mechanisms.Therefore, there is a problem that an unnecessary space exists between the scion
seedling carrying line and the root stock seedling carrying line, and thus, the entire
apparatus becomes too large. From EP-A-0 454 848 an apparatus for grafting seedlings is known which enables
grafting a plurality of seedlings simultaneously and thus avoids the drawback of the
grafting apparatus of the above cited prior art. The apparatus for grafting seedlings
includes scion seedling carrying means, root stock seedling carrying means disposed
parallel to the former, a seedling grasping and moving mechanism having
upper and lower grasping means for grasping the upper and lower portions of scion
and root stock seedlings simultaneously,
