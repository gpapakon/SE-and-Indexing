<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of clock recovery and of synchronisation for receiving information transmitted by an ATM network, and an implementation device. According to the invention, clock recovery is done by receiving data by means of a local clock HL whose frequency is equal to the sending frequency, the rephasing of the data being done only after having waited for the presence on the same phase signal of several fronts coherent with a clock pulse HL and by choosing, as rephasing signal, the phase signal satisfying this condition and framing the clock pulse; and resynchronisation being done by recognising the resynchronisation word possibly with error correction in this word. Application to ATM-mode transmission networks.

Method for clock retrieval and synchronisation of data 
transmitted in asynchronous time transmission mode, taking the 

form of information cells preceded by a binary precursor 
sequence, consisting, in order to provide these functions even 

in the presence of transmission errors, of: 

effecting reception from a local clock HL, with a 
period T, whose frequency is substantially equal to the 

transmission frequency 
introducing delays with a duration T/k on the binary 
sequence received in order to obtain several phase signals; 

characterised in that it also consists of: 
awaiting the presence, on any one phase signal, of 
several edges consistent with a clock pulse HL, 
choosing as the data rephasing signal the phase signal 
satisfying the above condition and framing the clock pulse, 
rephasing the data with this phase signal, 
recognizing in the binary precursor sequence a 
resynchronisation word for synchronising the reception of the 

data. 
Method of clock retrieval and data synchronisation 
according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 

resynchronisation takes place with transmission error 
correction on the binary precursor sequence and the generation 

of a synchronisation square wave during a period in which the 
synchronisation word referred to as the delimiter may appear. 
Method of clock retrieval and data synchronisation  
 

according to Claim 2, characterised in that, in order to avoid 
premature and erroneous recognition of the delimiter with a 

length D, the synchronisation square wave Cs is transmitted 
only if each analyzed sequence Si of D bits, taking as the 

starting point each of the bits between the rise of the square 
wave Cs and the actual start of the delimiter, differs from 

the delimiter by at least 2N+1 bits, N being the number of 
transmission errors able to be corrected. 
Method of clock retrieval and synchronisation according to 
any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the binary 

precursor sequence includes a preamble and a delimiter which 
overlap partially. 
Method of clock retrieval and synchronisation according to 
any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the delimiter 

and preamble overlap fully. 
Device for clock retrieval and synchronisation of data 
transmitted in asynchronous time transmission mode, taking the 

form of information cells preceded by a binary precursor 
sequence, characterised in that it includes: 


a) a rephasing circuit (RP) suitable for rephasing the data, 
even in the presence of transmission errors, this circuit 

comprising: 

a delay line (LR) for introducing phase delays on each 
pulse in the data sequence, with a duration T/k, where T 

is the period of the local clock HL; 
means (DC/RF) for detecting edges consistent with the 
clock pulses and for correcting errors appearing on the 

preamble of the precursor data sequence; 
b) a resynchronisation circuit (SYC) designed to recognize the 
delimiter in the precursor sequence in the presence of  

 
transmission errors in this delimiter, this circuit including, 

to this end, means of correcting errors on the delimiter. 
Device for clock retrieval and synchronisation according 
to Claim 6, characterised in that the rephasing circuit error 

correction detection means include as many flip-flop register 
stages (R1, R2) as there are errors to be corrected, these 

registers being interconnected by logic gates (ET) so as to 
store the detection of an edge only if an edge corresponding 

to the same phase has already been stored in the register of 
the preceding stage. 
Device for clock retrieval and synchronisation according 
to Claim 7, characterised in that the rephasing circuit (RP) 

also includes an edge register (RF) which stores an edge only 
if this edge has already been stored in the preceding steps on 

the same phase, the first edge arriving in the edge register 
determining the definitive phasing and halting the process of 

phase seeking. 
Device for clock retrieval and synchronisation according 
to Claim 8, characterised in that it also includes means (P) 

controlling the halting of the process of phase seeking and 
selection of the phase signal enabling the data to be 

rephased. 
Device for clock retrieval and synchronisation according 
to Claim 9, characterised in that the means for selecting the 

phase signal include a multiplexer (MUX) with hard-wired 
priority preventing the simultaneous propagation of two phases 

and selecting the rightmost or leftmost of the valid phases. 
Device for clock retrieval and synchronisation according 
to Claim 10, characterised in that the multiplexer (MUX) has a 

pipe-line structure including flip-flops D for increasing its 
operating frequency.  

 
Device for clock retrieval and synchronisation according 
to Claim 10, characterised in that the multiplexer (MUX)- has 

at the input, in cases where the preamble and delimiter 
overlap, memory means (RD1, RD2, RD3) for storing the bits 

common to the preamble and delimiter, while waiting for the 
appropriate rephasing signal to be selected. 
Device for clock retrieval and synchronisation according 
to Claim 12, characterised in that the memory means include 

type D flip-flop registers (RD1, RD2, RD3). 
Device for clock retrieval and synchronisation according 
to any one of Claims 6 to 13, characterised in that the 

resynchronisation circuit (SYC) includes a serial recognition 
register (RS) whose length is equal to that of the delimiter 

to which N other registers offset by one bit are connected by 
means of logic gates (NE, PL), N being the number of errors to 

be corrected in the delimiter. 
Device for clock retrieval and synchronisation according 
to Claim 14, characterised in that the resynchronisation 

circuit (SYC) also includes counting (COMP) and detection 
(DET) means enabling an end of cell signal SFC to be generated 

in order to provide the synchronisation square wave function.
