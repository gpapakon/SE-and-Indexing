<ABSTRACT>
A film molding method and apparatus capable of 
shortening a mold cycle time and obtaining a molded 

product of an excellent quality. A method of hot-press 
molding a polyparaphenyleneterephthalamide (PPTA) film 

into a predetermined shape includes a first step of 
evaporating water from a PPTA film containing water at 

least 50 % or more as a swelling agent, and obtaining 
an amorphous film having a density less than a 

predetermined density and a modulus in tension of about 
70 %; and a second process of hot-press molding the 

film for a predetermined time period by metal molds 
heated up to at least 330 °C to crystallize the film to 

have a predetermined density specific to a PPTA film 
and produce an intrinsic physical value, and obtaining 

a molded product of the film. A film molding apparatus 
for performing the film molding method includes holes 

or slits (1h) opening at the surface of each of the metal 
molds (1a,1b), and an air suction unit and an air exhaust unit 

provided for each of the metal molds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method
for hot-press molding a para-orientation
aromatic polyamide film, particularly a typical
polyparaphenyleneterephthalamide (hereinafter called
"PPTA") film, into a predetermined shape, capable of
efficiently molding a film with a good quality.A para-orientation aromatic polyamide film,
particularly a PPTA film, has an excellent acoustic
property. The present inventors have proposed an
acoustic vibration member made of a molded PPTA film
and methods of molding a PPTA film (Japanese Patent
Laid-open Publication No.3-38200).According to the first method of these
molding methods, a PPTA film in a gel state containing
water at least 50 % or more, or preferable 80 % or
more, as a swelling agent and having a 100 % modulus in
tension is hot-press molded by a hot pressing machine,
and is thermally fixed while clamping the film by metal
molds. According to the second molding method, a PPTA 
film thermally treated in an unrolled state to have a
modulus in tension of about 40 % or more is hot-press
molded by a hot pressing machine. Using the first and
second molding methods, mass production of acoustic
vibration members has been performed conventionally.The outline of the first method will be described
with reference to Figs.9 to 12. A gel film Fg
containing water at least 50 % or more, preferable 80 %
or more, as a swelling agent, is clamped by metal molds
1u and 1b heated to about 150 °C, and thereafter the
molds are heated up to 350 °C or more. Thereafter, the
upper mold 1u is cooled down to 140 to 150 °C and the
lower mold 1u is cooled down near 150 to 160 °C.
Lastly, the metal molds 1u and 1b are released to
dismount the molded film.More particularly, as shown in Fig.9, the gel film
Fg is introduced to the intermediate of the upper and
lower metal molds 1u and 1b. As the metal molds lower,
the heater blocks 2 heated to about 380 to 400 °C move
to attach the back surfaces of the upper and lower
metal molds 1u and 1b so that the metal molds are
heated and the gel film Fg is clamped by the metal
molds. The temperature of the upper and lower metal
molds 1u and 1b at the time when the clamping starts is
140 to 150 °C. After the clamping, the metal molds 1u 
and 1b immediately raise their temperatures because the
heater blocks 2 heated to 380 to 400 °C contact the
metal molds.As the temperatures of the metal molds 1u and 1b
rise, water contained in the film Fg vaporizes in an
accelerated manner and is expelled out of the metal
molds 1u and 1b. When the metal mold temperature
