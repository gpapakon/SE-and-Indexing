<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method of speedily measuring 
the strength of individual abrasive grains such as 

diamonds in which the grains are crushed between two tungsten carbide 
surface hardened rollers (10,20) and the compressive force exerted on the 

grain by the rollers at the moment of fracture is 
measured using load cell (70).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus 
and method for measuring the strength of individual 
abrasive grains. It is known to measure the strength of a 
batch of grains by placing a small sample of the batch 
in a capsule with a steel ball, agitating it vigorously 
for a fixed amount of time, and measuring the amount of 
fragments produced. One disadvantage of this method is 
that it measures the strength of the weakest grains 
while giving little information about the strength of 
the strongest grains. Another disadvantage is that it 
has a low ability to discriminate among batches of 
similar hardness. It is also known to measure the strength of 
individual grains by crushing them one at a time in a 
press. In this method individual grains are placed in 
a press between two anvils which move together along a 
single axis with increasing force until the grain 
fractures. One disadvantage of this method is that it 
takes one to two minutes to measure the strength of 
each grain. This method is avoided in commercial 
applications because of this lack of speed. For the foregoing reasons, there is a need 
for a speedy means of measuring the strength of 
individual abrasive grains. The present invention is directed to an 
apparatus and method that satisfies these needs. An 
apparatus having features of the present invention  
 
comprises a pair of hard counter-rotating rollers 
adapted with a means to measure the compressive force 
applied by the rollers to grains passing between the 
rollers at the moment of grain fracture. A method according to the present invention 
comprises drawing a grain of hard material into a gap 
between two rollers and thus compressing the grain 
until it fractures, while measuring the peak 
compressive force necessary to fracture the grain. It is an object of this invention to provide 
a speedy and accurate means of measuring the strength 
of individual grains of hard material. The above and other objects and advantages of 
the invention will be apparent upon consideration of 
the following detailed description, taken in 
conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which 
like reference characters refer to like parts 
throughout, and in which FIG. 1 is a representation of 
an embodiment of the present invention. Individual abrasive grains are dropped into a 
narrow gap between two counter-rotating rollers 
constructed of a hard material. Because the size of 
the grain is greater than the gap, a compressive force 
is exerted on the grain as it is drawn into the gap by 
th
