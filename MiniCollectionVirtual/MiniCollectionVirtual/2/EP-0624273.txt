<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a humidifier for wooden 
musical instruments; more particularly it relates to a stiff 
humidifier that is supported in the interior of the sound box of 
a stringed instrument. The installed humidifier is constructed 
so that it does not contact an interior surface of the sound box. Musicians who play wooden stringed instruments have long 
realized the need to maintain a sufficiently moist atmosphere 
within the sound box both while the instrument is stored in its 
case and while the instrument is being played. U.S. patents 
3,407,700 - Hollander and 3,721,152 - Von Meyer both relate to 
humidifiers that can be placed in the sound box of a wooden 
stringed instrument either when it is stored in its case or when 
it is being played. The Hollander patent discloses a humidifier, 
in the form of a flexible tubular snake having a water absorbent 
core, that is placed into the interior of a violin sound box. The 
humidifier is fed through the f-hole of the violin and a button, 
having a diameter that is greater than the width of the f-hole, 
at the end of the humidifier is intended to prevent the humidifier 
from falling completely into the interior of the violin sound box. 
The tubular snake is perforated along its length to allow the 
moisture to evaporate into the interior of the violin sound box. 
One disadvantage of the humidifier of Hollander is that since it 
is long, flexible, and limp, the violinist can not hold it at one 
end and feed it through the f-hole in one continuous motion but 
rather the violinist must feed it through the f-hole a few inches 
at a time. Also, when the humidifier is fully inserted into the 
interior of the sound box, a portion of the flexible humidifier 
contacts the interior surface of the sound box which blocks some 
of the moisture evaporation apertures and may excessively wet the 
contacted interior areas. Another disadvantage is that the 
retaining button of the humidifier is visible when the instrument 
is played. This humidifier tends to be loose and rattles during 
use of violin and tends to work free and out of the f-hole. The Von Meyer patent discloses a humidifier that is 
inserted through the sound hole of a guitar and is held in  
 
position by a clip that attaches to the top surface of the guitar 
at the sound hole. The humidifier of Von Meyer is dimensionally 
limited to one that can fit through a hole in the top plate of the 
instrument. U.S. patent 4,649,793 - Blackshear et al. discloses a 
humidifier that extends into the

A humidifier 
(10)
 mountable through an aperture of a 
wooden musical instrument's sound box 
(12)
, the sound box having 
a side wall aperture 
(19)
 used for a string anchor insert, the 
humidifier characterized by: 


a self-supporting, vapor-permeable, liquid-retaining 
tubular member 
(30)
; and 
an attachment means 
(28)
 connected to one end of 
the tubular member for supporting the tubular member 
(30)
 within 
the sound box 
(12)
 from said side wall aperture 
(19)
 such that 
the tubular member 
(30)
 is suspended within the interior of the 
sound box 
(12)
. 
The humidifier of claim 1 further comprising a liquid-absorbent 
material 
(32)
 situated within the tubular member for 
retaining liquid. 
The humidifier of claim 1 wherein the tubular member 

(30)
 is perforated. 
The humidifier of claim 1 wherein the tubular member 

(30)
 is cantilevered from the attachment means. 
The humidifier of claim 4 wherein a portion 
(45)
 of the 
tubular member, adjacent the cantilevered end, is not liquid 

permeable, and wherein the attachment means 
(42)
 contains a 
liquid filling passageway 
(37)
 into the tubular member 
(30)
, the 
humidifier further comprising a perforated barrier 
(46)
 
separating the non-liquid permeable section 
(45)
 of the tubular 
member from the vapor permeable portion of the tubular member 

thereby forming a liquid reservoir 
(35)
 at the cantilevered end 
of the tubular member 
(30)
, and a plug 
(39)
 inserted into the 
attachment means for sealing the humidifier after it is filled, 

the barrier perforations 
(47)
 being sized to control the rate 
of flow of liquid into the vapor-permeable section of the 

tubular member.  
 
The humidifier of claim 1 wherein the humidifier is 
mounted in a side wall string anchor aperture 
(19)
 of a wooden 
musical instrument. 
The humidifier of claim 6 further comprising a liquid-absorbent 
material 
(32)
 situated within the tubular member for 
retaining liquid. 
The humidifier of claim 6 wherein the tubular member 

(30)
 is perforated. 
The humidifier of claim 6 wherein the tubular member 

(30)
 is cantilevered from the attachment means. 
The humidifier of claim 9 wherein a portion 
(45)
 of 
the tubular member, adjacent the cantilevered end, is not liquid 

permeable, and wherein the attachment means 
(28)
 contains a 
liquid filling passageway 
(37)
 into the tubular member 
(30)
, the 
humidifier further comprising a perforated barrier 
(46)
 
separating the non-liquid permeable section 
(45)
 of the tubular 
member from the vapor permeable portion of the tubular member 

thereby forming a liquid reservoir 
(35)

attachment means for sealing the humidifier after it is filled, 

the barrier perforations 
(47)
 being sized to control the rate 
of flow of liquid into the vapor permeable section of the 

tubular member. 
The humidifier of claim 6 wherein the instrument is 
a violin having a modified string anchor insert 
(24)
 wherein the 
aperture 
(19)
 also extends through the string anchor insert 

(24)
.  
 
The humidifier of claim 11 wherein the string anchor 
insert 
(24)
 is threaded and the attachment means 
(28)
 has mating 
threads for threadingly engaging the anchor inserts. 
The humidifier of claim 11 wherein the attachment 
means 
(28)
 is friction-fitted to the string anchor insert 
(24)
. 
The humidifier of claim 6 wherein the instrument has 
an end rest assembly, including an end block 
(60)
 and a shaft 

(52)
 that threadingly engages the end block
