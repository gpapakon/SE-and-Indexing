<DESCRIPTION>
Allergens constitute the most abundant proteins of grass pollen. which
is the major cause of allergic disease in temperate climates (Marsh (1975)
Allergens and the genetics of allergy: in M. Sela (ed). The Antigens, Vol. 3, pp
271-359, Academic Press Inc., London, New York)., Hill etal. (1979)
Medical Journal of Australia 1, 426-429). The first descriptions of the
allergenic proteins in ryegrass showed that they are immunochemically
distinct. and are known as groups I, II, III and IV (Johnson and Marsh (1965)
Nature, 206, 935-942; and Johnson and Marsh (1966) Immunochemistry 3,
91-100). Using the International Union of Immunological Societies' (IUIS)
nomenclature, these allergens are designated Lol p I, Lol p II, Lol p III and
Lol p IV. In addition, another important Lolium prenne L. allergen which has
been identified in the literature is Lol p V also known as Lol p IX or Lol p Ib
(Singh et al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 88:1384-1388. Suphioglu, et
al. 1992. Lancet. 339: 569-572.These five proteins have been identified in pollen ryegrass, Lolium
perenne L., and act as allergens in triggering immediate (Type 1)
hypersensitivity in susceptible humans.Lol p V is defined as an allergen because of its ability to bind to
specific IgE in sera of ryegrass-sensitive patients. to act as an antigen in IgG
responses and to trigger T-cell responses. The allergenic properties have been
demonstrated by immunoblotting studies showing 80% of ryegrass pollen
sensitive patients possessed specific IgE antibody that bound to Lol p V
isoforms (PCT applicaton publication no. WO 93/04174, page 65). These
results indicate that Lol p V is a major ryegrass allergen.Substantial allergenic cross-reactivity between grass pollens has been
demonstrated using an IgE-binding assay, the radioallergo-sorbent test
(RAST), for example, as described by Marsh etal. (1970) J. Allergy, 46, 107-121.
and Lowenstein (1978) Prog. Allergy. 25, 1-62. (Karger, Basel).The immunochemical relationship of Lol p V with other grass pollen
antigens have been demonstrated using both polyclonal and monoclonal 
antibodies (Zhang et al., Int Arch Allergy Appl Immunol, 96:28-34 (1991);
Roberts et al., Int Arch Allergy Appl Immunol, 98:178-180 (1992); and
Mattheisen and Lowenstein, Clinical and Experimental Allergy, 21: 309-320
(1991). Antibodies have been prepared to purified proteins that bind IgE
components. These data demonstrate that a major allergen is present in
pollen of closely related grasses is immunochemically similar to Lol p V and
are
