<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a process for producing 
hydrogen peroxide through catalytic reaction of oxygen 

with hydrogen in an aqueous medium in the presence of a 
platinum group metal catalyst, in which an organic 

solvent having only limited solubility with water and 
less hydrogen peroxide-dissolving ability compared to 

that of water is caused to be concurrently present in the 
reactor, and oxygen and hydrogen are catalytically 

reacted in an aqueous medium in the presence of a 
water- and organic solvent-insoluble, hydrophilic 

platinum group metal catalyst, under a low reaction 
pressure, to form high concentration aqueous hydrogen 

peroxide solution within a short time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved process
for producing hydrogen peroxide through catalytic
reaction of oxygen with hydrogen in a reaction medium.
More specifically, the invention relates to a production
process of hydrogen peroxide in which hydrogen peroxide
concentration in the acquired aqueous solution is
increased by the virtue of concurrent presence with
water, which is the reaction medium, in the reactor of an
inflammable, organic solvent having only limited
solubility with water.The main process for industrial production of
hydrogen peroxide currently in use is an autoxidation
process using an alkylanthraquinone as the medium. This
process has problems in that it requires a multiplicity
of steps such as the reduction, oxidation, separation by
aqueous extraction, purification and concentration, etc.,
which render the process complex and increase the equipment
and operation costs. Further problems reside in
loss of alkylanthraquinone due to deterioration and
degradation of reducing catalyst.Aiming at removal of those problems, a variety
of production processes other than the above have been
attempted, one of which comprises direct hydrogen
peroxide production from oxygen and hydrogen, using a
catalyst in a reaction medium. Already processes for
making hydrogen peroxide from oxygen and hydrogen using
platinum group metals as the catalyst have been proposed,
with the indication that hydrogen peroxide could be
formed at reasonably high concentration levels [Japanese
Patent Publication Nos. 47121/1981, 18646/1980 and
23401/1989; and Japanese Patent Application Kokai (Laid-open)
No. 156005/1988]. These patent publications and Kokai application
disclose processes for making aqueous hydrogen peroxide
solutions by conducting the reaction using as the
reaction medium an aqueous solution only, which contains
an acid and/or a halogen ion. As a process other than
those, also disclosed is the one for conducting the
reaction using a mixture, in which an organic solvent and
water are concurrently present in the reactor. That is,
Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 17763/1986, 29363/1987
and 30122/1987 disclose processes for producing hydrogen
peroxide comprising causing concurrent presence of an
organic solvent having a limited miscibility with water
and water in a reactor, whereby contacting hydrogen with
oxygen in a bi-phase liquid mixture composed of an
aqueous phase and the organic solvent phase. The
catalyst used in these processes is homogeneously
dissolved in the organic phase, so that the hydrogen
