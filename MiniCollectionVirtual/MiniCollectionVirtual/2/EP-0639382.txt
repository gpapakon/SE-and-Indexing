<ABSTRACT>
In a method for producing a cement for medical use, a 
liquid component containing a polymerizable substance is 

combined with a solid component comprising a plastic substance 
to provide a setting mass to form the cement. In 

order to e.g. improve the biological and mechanical properties 
of the cement and allow it to be mixed by modern 

mixing procedures, which further improves the cement quality, 
said plastic substance is mixed with a particulate 

crystalline ceramic material prior to combining said 
liquid and solid components. A cement for medical use is 

also defined as is the use of set cement as an anchorage 
for the fixation of prostheses or parts of prostheses or 

bone and as a substitute material for bone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for producing a cement
for medical use according to which a liquid component containing
a polymerizable substance is combined with a solid
component comprising a plastic substance to provide a setting
mass to form the cement
which is characterized in that prior to combining
said liquid and solid components, said plastic substance
is mixed with an in vivo non-resorbable, particulate
crystalline ceramic material which has been subjected to a sintering process. The invention also relates
to a cement for such uses and to the use of set cement as
an anchorage for the fixation of prostheses or parts of
prostheses or bone and as a substitute material for bone.The use of anchorage substances in surgical procedures,
especially for implants, has led to the development of
so-called bone cement. The most common use of bone cement
has been to fill the gap between a joint implant and tissue,
primarily bone. As the cement sets around an implant immediate
fixation will be achieved. This is especially important 
in the often severly handicapped eiderly group of patients
being operated with joint implants. When bone cement
is used weight bearing is generally allowed within the first
postoperative days. The most important complication hitherto
has been infection, joint implants breakage or dislocation.
Through strict aseptic and antiseptic measures and
methodologic development the most severe problems today are
wear of the polymer component and loosening between the metallic
and polymer implants and bone leading to an interface
failure with bone resorption and loss of implant anchorage.
An improvement of material and technique has been
going on since joint implant procedure with the bone cement
started in the late 1950's through cooperation between researchers,
engineers, manufacturers and surgeons.The most important development in the area of bone cement
has been a change of the additives used in bone cement.
Various substances with particles between 20-300 micrometers
in size have been used. Particulate additive powder
has mainly been used in a spherical form. This may be regarded
as the accepted technique today. Both resorbable
particulate powder such as tri-calcium phosphate and non--resorbable
powder such as zirconium oxide have been used.
The addition of particulate powder varies between 5-30%
with 20-25% regarded as optimum. In contrast to the additives
which have a secondary role, for example zirconium
oxide or barium sulphate which give a radiopaque bone cement,
and tri-calcium
