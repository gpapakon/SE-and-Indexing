<DESCRIPTION>
 TEST APPARATUS FOR PRESSURE TESTING EQUIPMENT HAVING A FLANGE AND METHOD OF PRESSURE TESTING This invention relates to a test apparatus for pressure testing equipment having a flange and to a method of pressure testing.Valves and similar flow control equipment are normally bolted into high pressure systems via flanges.In order to test such equipment it is normal to bolt the equipment to test apparatus via a flanged connection.In the case of large valves for use in the oil and chemical engineering industries this can take several hours involving the use of a large number of bolts which have to be individually tightened to the desired torque in a specified order. A similar problem arises in dis¬ mounting the valves.The present invention aims, at least in its pre¬ ferred embodiments, to facilitate the mounting and dismounting of the equipment to be tested. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a test apparatus for pressure testing equipment having a flange, which test apparatus com¬ prises:(a) an upwardly extending cylindrical housing; (b) a piston slidably mounted in said cylindrical housing;(c) means for introducing hydraulic fluid into a chamber beneath said piston; and(d) retaining means for limiting separation of a flange on the equipment to be tested relative to said upwardly extending cylindrical housing so that said piston may be pressed into sealing engagement against said flange by admitting hydraulic fluid to said cham¬ ber. Optional features of the present invention are set 

 out in Claims 2 to 8.The present invention also provides a method of pressure testing equipment having a flange, which method comprises the steps of: (a) moving said flange into general alignment with the upwardly extending cylindrical housing of a test apparatus in accordance with the present invention;(b) applying two or more retaining members to limit separation of said flange and said upwardly extending cylindrical housing;(c) introducing hydraulic fluid into said chamber to urge said piston into sealing equipment with said flange, and(d) introducing hydraulic fluid into said equipment o test the integrity thereof. 
For a better understanding of the invention refer¬ ence will now be made, by way of example, to the accom¬ panying drawings, in which:-Fig. 1 is a side view, partly in section, of one embodiment of a test apparatus in accordance with the present invention testing a blow out preventer (BOP) ;Fig. 2 is a view along line II-II of Fig. 1; andFig. 3 is a view, to an enlarged scale,

<CLAIMS>
 CLAIMS 1. A test apparatus for pressure testing equipment having a flange, which test apparatus comprises:
(a) an upwardly extending cylindrical housing (26); (b) a piston (32) slidably mounted in said cylin¬ drical housing (26);
(c) means (60) for introducing hydraulic fluid into a chamber (30) beneath said piston (32); and
(d) retaining means (40) for limiting separation of a flange (22 ) on the equipment to be tested relative to said upwardly extending cylindrical housing (26) so that said piston (32) may be pressed into sealing engagement against said flange (22) by admitting hydraulic fluid to said chamber (30) . 2. A test apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, including at least one groove (65a, 65b) in the top (66) of said piston (32) adapted to receive a gasket seal (64) there¬ in.
3. A test apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, where- in said retaining means comprises separate first and second guide rings (40) each having spaced parallel lips (42, 44).
4. A test apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, including a skid (24) supporting said upwardly extending cylindrical housing (26) .
5. A test apparatus as claimed in Claim 3 and 4, including means (48) mounted on said skid (24) for positioning said guide rings (40) .
6. A test apparatus as claimed in Claim 5, wherein said means (48) comprises a hydraulically operable piston and cylinder arrangement (48) .
7. A test apparatus as claimed in Claim 4, 5 or 6, including spaced apart guide means (52, 54) for support¬ ing and guiding said retaining means (40) . 8. A test apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim, 


 wherein said piston is provided with a bore for retain¬ ing an upwardly extending drill pipe.
9. A method of pressure testing equipment having a flange (22), which method comprises the steps of: (a) moving said flange (22) into general alignment with the upwardly extending cylindrical housing (26) of a test apparatus as claimed in any preceding Claim;
(b) applying two or more retaining members (40) to limit separation of said flange (22) and said upwardly extending cylindrical housing (26);
(c) introducing hydraulic fluid into said chamber (30) to urge said piston (32) into sealing equipment with said flange (22), and
(d) introducing hydraulic fluid into said equipment to test the integrity thereof.
10. A method according to Claim 9, wherein said equip¬ ment comprises at least one blow out preventer.
