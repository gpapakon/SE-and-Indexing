<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an animal model which is constructed by 
transplanting IgE-producing vegetative cells in a non-rej
ecting 
animal to endow the animal with ability to induce IgE-mediated 

allergic reaction caused by the transplanted cells, a method of 
preparing the animal model and a method of screening 

prophylactic and therapeutic agents for IgE-related diseases. 
Screening of the prophylactic and therapeutic agents for IgE-related 

diseases can be efficiently and expediently carried out 
using the animal model according to the present invention in 

which IgE-mediated allergic reaction is repeatedly induced by 
repeated antigen challenge.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a method of screening prophylactic and therapeutic agents for
IgE-related diseases using the same.Recently, as the mechanism of the allergic reaction has
been elucidated, attention is given to the role of IgE and
development of various antiallergic drugs has been vigorously
conducted with targeting for IgE. In the development of the
antiallergic drug, a screening of candidate substances is of
importance.One approach to this end comprises inducing an IgE-mediated
allergic reaction and checking to see how far this
reaction is inhibited. Such approach includes a method
comprising the use of animals subjected to passive immunization
with purified IgE or animals subjected to active immunization
with an antigen as model animals. Both methods are useful but
not suited for inducing an allergic reaction repeatedly for
investigating the inhibitory effect of test substances.Thus, in the former method, IgE must be repeatedly
administered in order that the allergic reaction may be induced
in repetition, with the result that a drug screening cannot be 
expediently carried out.The latter method is also disadvantageous in that even
though an allergic reaction can be repeatedly induced, not only
the antigen-specific IgE but also other antibodies such as the
reaction-interfering antigen-specific IgG etc. are produced in
the body so that the inhibitory effect on IgE-mediated allergic
reaction cannot be accurately estimated.E. Kilchherr et al describe the regulation of human IgE
response in hu-PBL-SCID mice (Cellular Immunology 151, 241-256(1993)).An object of the present invention is to solve the
above-described problems and to provide an animal model which
enables repeated .observation of IgE-mediated allergic reaction
and expedient screening of prophylactic and therapeutic agents
for IgE-related diseases and a method of screening prophylactic
and therapeutic agents for IgE-related diseases using the same.The above-mentioned object can be achieved by
a method of screening prophylactic and therapeutic
agents for IgE-related diseases using
a rodent model which is constructed by transplanting
an IgE-producing vegetative cell in a non-rejecting
rodent to induce IgE-mediated allergic reaction caused by the
transplanted cells. Fig. 1 graphically shows the time course of anti-trinitrophenyl
(TNP)•IgE level in blood collected from each
mouse into which anti-TNP•IgE producing hybridoma IGELa2 has
been transplanted or not transplanted. In Fig. 1, A shows the
results of untransplanted group, B shows
