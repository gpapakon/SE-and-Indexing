<ABSTRACT>
In a three-piece solid golf ball 
comprising a center core, an intermediate layer, 

and a cover, the center core (1) has a diameter 
of at least 29 mm and a specific gravity of less 

than 1.4, the intermediate layer (2) has a 
thickness of at least 1 mm, a specific gravity 

of less than 1.2, and a hardness of at least 85 
on JIS C scale, and the cover (3) has a 

thickness of 1-3 mm. The ball has a good total 
balance of properties in that feeling and 

controllability are improved at no sacrifice of 
flying performance and durability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates to golf balls.Among a variety of golf balls, thread-wound golf balls and solid golf balls are now popular. The solid golf balls are
currently increasing to mainstream popularity. Among them, two-piece solid golf balls consisting of a core and a cover
are the most widespread.Most amateur golfers are fond of two-piece solid golf balls, which have excellent flying performance and durability
despite the disadvantages of a very hard feel on hitting and low control due to rapid ball separation on hitting. However
many professional golfers and skilled amateur golfers who stress feeling and control prefer wound golf balls, especially
wound golf balls using a soft balata cover, to two-piece solid golf balls. The wound golf balls are superior in feeling and
control, but inferior in flying distance and durability to the two-piece solid golf balls.Seeing that two-piece solid golf balls and wound golf balls have contradictory characteristics as mentioned above,
players make a choice of ball depending on their own skill and taste.In order to develop solid golf balls having a hitting feel approximate to the wound golf balls, two-piece solid golf balls
of soft type have been considered. For such two-piece solid golf balls of soft type, soft cores must be used. If the cores
are soft, however, repulsion becomes low with a concomitant loss of flying performance; Furthermore durability is considerably
deteriorated. That is, the superior flying performance and durability which are characteristic of two-piece solid
golf balls are lost and, in an extreme case, the balls become unacceptable for practical use.Controllability, which is desirable even on full shots with drivers, is most important on control shots like approach
shots. If for example a shot needs to fly beyond the bunker but then only a short distance from the green edge to the
cup, a player who is either professional or amateur will naturally wish to hit a ball with a minimal run. Such controllability
of a golf ball largely depends on spin properties.On a full shot with a club having a relatively large loft, the club loft is more dominant than the ball nature so that
almost all balls are given an appropriate amount of spin and few balls overrun. However, on a approach shot over a
short distance of 30 or 50 yards, balls will significantly vary in run or controllability. The major factor causing such differences
is not the basic structure but rather the identity of the cover material. In two-piece solid golf balls, however, covers
made of
