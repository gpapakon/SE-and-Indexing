<ABSTRACT>
An object reflector detection system, for example, for 
use in surveying, comprises a laser beam emitter (3) 

which is arranged to emit a circularly polarized light 
beam towards an object reflector (2, 2'). The object 

reflector has a first reflection area which simply 
returns the incoming beam with polarization unaltered, 

and a second reflection area which returns the beam with 
an altered polarization. First and second detecting 

means (24, 25) are provided for detecting the altered and 
unaltered returning beams. The position of the object 

reflector is then determined based upon a comparison 
between the respective outputs of the first and second 

detection means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser rotary irradiation
system for detecting an object reflector for example
in the field of surveying using laser beam, in which polarized
irradiation beam is irradiated from a main unit to the object
reflector and the polarized reflection beam reflected by the
object reflector is detected.In order to determine reference of height in the field
of civil engineering and architectural technique, laser
rotary irradiation system for rotary scanning of polarized
irradiation beam in a horizontal plane is now used.In recent years, visible semiconductor laser has been
developed for practical application, and a laser rotary
irradiation system using the visible semiconductor laser has
also appeared, and this has made it possible to perform
visual surveying. In such a laser rotary irradiation system,
laser output is restricted in order to ensure safety for
operators. For this reason, working distance has become
relatively short in the surveying and measurement requiring
visual confirmation of reflection of the polarized
irradiation beam.In this respect, a laser rotary irradiation system is
currently used, in which polarized irradiation beam is
reciprocally scanned to increase apparent luminance of the
polarized reflection light beam and working distance is
elongated. In order to achieve reciprocal scanning within
adequate range, it is necessary to identify scanning 
position. For this purpose, an object reflector detection
system is used, in which an object reflector is arranged at a
working point and polarized reflection light beam from the
object reflector is detected, and the position of the object
reflector is identified.In the object reflector detection system as described
above, in order to identify the object reflector, outgoing
light is polarized in such manner that a direction of
polarized reflection light from the object reflector changes
in proportion to polarizing direction of the outgoing light.
This is to discriminate from unnecessary reflector such as
glass surface, which has a property to reflect light by
preserving polarizing direction.In the laser rotary irradiation system as described
above, reflection light is detected by detecting means
corresponding to polarized light from the object reflector.
There are often many unnecessary reflectors at the working
site for civil or architectural engineering, and the modes of
reflection are not constant, containing various polarizing
components.For this reason, in case strong reflection light enters
detector of main
