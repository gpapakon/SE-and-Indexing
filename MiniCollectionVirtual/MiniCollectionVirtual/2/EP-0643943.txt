<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic 
sphygmomanometer, and, more particularly, to an electronic 
sphygmomanometer arranged to be operated in accordance with 
the Korotkoff method and the oscillometric method. In a blood pressure measuring method without watching 
blood, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and 
mean blood pressure are measured based on a change of blood 
flow in an artery under the cuff which wraps on the blood 
pressure measuring portion, through the process of reducing 
pressure of the cuff in slow fixed speed after the 
pressurization of the cuff over the systolic blood pressure 
expected, or the process of pressuring the cuff in fixed 
speed from the pressure less than the diastolic blood 
pressure to the pressure more than the systolic blood 
pressure. There are the Riva-Rocci-Korotkoff method of 
measuring the blood pressure in accordance with a 
recognition of Korotkoff sounds (to be called the "K-sound 
method" hereinafter) and the oscillometric method of  
 
measuring the blood pressure in accordance with the 
oscillating pulse wave overlapping on the cuff pressure (to 
be called the "OSC method" hereinafter) as the above method 
without watching blood. Conventional electronic sphygmomanometers have been 
arranged to act in accordance with only either method of 
the above-described methods: the K-sound method and the 
OSC method. Therefore, these electronic sphygmomanometers 
have shown the advantage and the drawback which each method 
has. For example, a problem arises in that an accurate 
blood pressure level cannot be obtained from persons who 
show too weak a K-sound to be detected, persons having 
strong pulses and patients who are being subjected to 
artificial dialysis and who therefore show strong artery 
shunt noise, causing the K-sound to be undesirably detected 
to the level below the diastolic blood pressure. On the 
other hand, the OSC method sphygmomanometer has a 
problem in that the blood pressure cannot be accurately 
measured from a person who shows too small oscillating 
pulse waves, when the cuff belt is wound too loosely, when 
a relatively large cuff is wound around a thin arm or when 
the blood pressure change is too excessive during the blood 
pressure measurement operation (the blood pressure change 
at breathing time.  The parent application overcomes the above-described 
problems experienced with the conventional electronic 
sphygmomanometer and provides an electronic 
sphygmomanometer capable of overcoming a problem in 
which
