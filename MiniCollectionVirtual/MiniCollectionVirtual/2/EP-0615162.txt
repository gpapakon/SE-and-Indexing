<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to infra-red sensitive
aqueous wash-off photoimaging elements. In particular
this invention relates to elements comprising a support
that bears an active layer comprising polymers containing
amine salts and/or quaternized amine groups.Elements for image-reproduction are well-known in
both the graphic arts and electronics industries. Such
elements are typically imaged by exposure with actinic
radiation through an image--bearing transparency, such as
a color separation transparency. After imagewise
exposure, the imaged element is typically processed by
washout of soluble image areas, toning with a colorant,
peeling apart, or combinations of these techniques.Infra-red lasers have been developed as output
devices for various image capture, storage, and
processing systems. Since these lasers heat only a small
region at a time, an image can be produced pixel by
pixel. Computer control allows images of high definition
to be produced at high speed. Elements that can be
directly exposed by these lasers eliminate costly
intermediate silver halide transparencies, and the
associated processing chemicals, as well as reduce the
time and effort required to prepare an image.Many of the well-known imaging elements are
processed in organic solvents or aqueous base. The use
of organic solvents is frequently undesirable because of
flammability, toxicity, and waste disposal
considerations. The use of aqueous base is frequently 
undesirable because of toxicity, waste disposal, and
corrosion problems. Thus elements that can be processed
in aqueous solvents, preferably ordinary tap water, are
desirable. Thus, there continues to be a need for
aqueous processable photoimaging elements that can be
directly imaged with infra-red radiation and processed in
aqueous solvents, preferably ordinary tap water.The invention provides an aqueous processable negative
working element for thermally-induced photoimaging, said element
comprising, in order:
(A) a dimensionally stable support, and(B) an active layer comprising:
(1) a cationic polymer containing pendant ammonium
groups, said cationic polymer being removable
from said support by aqueous processing, said
pendant groups having the general formula:
-N[(R1)(R2)(R3)]+ X-,
wherein:
R1, R2, and R3 are independently selected from
hydrogen, substituted and unsubstituted alkyl,
substituted and unsubstituted alkenyl, and
substituted and unsubstituted aryl;R1, R2, and R3 together contain not more than
thirty carbon atoms; andX is a anion;(2) an infra-red absorbing
