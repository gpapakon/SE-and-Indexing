<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the separation of silane from a gas mixture containing at least one gas from the group consisting of Ar and He, according to which the gas mixture is passed into a membrane module (6), so as to obtain, at the outlet of the module, a silane concentration which is greater than the initial silane concentration in the gas mixture.

Process for separating silane from a gaseous medium
containing at least one gas from the g
roup consisting of Ar
and He, wherein :


a - the gaseous medium containing silane is passed through
a membranous separation module having at least one membrane

of the polyimide or polyaramide type;
b - adjustments are made to at least one of the parameters
included within the group consisting of the pressure of the

gas supply to the said module, the temperature of the said
module and the flow rate at the discharge outlet from the

said module, so as to obtain, at the discharge outlet from
the module, a gaseous mixture of which the silane

concentration is greater than the silane concentration of
the said gaseous medium.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the
silane concentration in the said gaseous mixture obtained

at the discharge outlet from the said module is increased
by raising the said supply pressure, and/or raising the

temperature of the said module and/or reducing the flow
rate of the gas at the discharge outlet from the said

module.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the
silane concentration in the said gaseous mixture obtained

at the discharge outlet from the said module is reduced by
lowering the said supply pressure, and/or lowering the

temperature of the said module and/or increasing the flow
rate of the gas at the discharge outlet from the said

module. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the
gaseous medium arrives under pressure at the membranous

module, the difference in pressure between the inlet and
permeate side of the membrane not exceeding 100 × 10
5
 Pa
absolute.
Process according to claim 4, characterized in that the
difference in pressure between the inlet and the permeate

side of the membrane is situated within the interval 10
5
 Pa
to 20 × 10
5
 Pa absolute.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the
gaseous medium arrives at the membranous module under a low

pressure.
Process according to claim 6, characterized in that the
said low pressure is compensated for by lowering, at the

permeate side of the membrane, the partial pressure of the
gaseous medium from which silane is separated.
Process according to claim 7, characterized in that the
partial pressure of the gaseous medium from which silane is

separated is lowered, on the permeate side (8) of the
membrane 6), by using one of the following methods :


the permeate side (8) of the membrane (6) is put under
vacuum;
the permeate side (8) of the membrane (6) is purged with
a gas having a low degree of permeation from the permeate

to the interior of the membrane.
Process according to claim 8, characterized in that the
gas used for purging is nitrogen. 
Process according to claim 8, characterized in that the
gas used for purging is SF
6
.
Process according to one of claims 6 to 10,
characterized in that the pressure of the gaseous medium to

be separated which arrives at the membranous module is
situated within the interval 10
4
 Pa to 5 × 10
5
 Pa absolute.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 11,
characterized in that the gaseous medium treated in the

membranous module is supplied by a silane generator.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 11,
characterized in that :


a) the gaseous medium treated in the membranous module
consists of the reaction mixture obtained at the outlet

from a reactor using silane, this reaction medium
containing a proportion of unreacted silane;
b) the mixture obtained at the outlet from the membranous
module (6) is then recycled to the inlet of the reactor.
Process according to claim 13, characterized in that
the reactor is a deposition reactor, using silane as a

gaseous precursor of silicon.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 11,
characterized in that :


a) the gaseous medium treated in the membranous module is
provided by a gas storage vessel of the cylinder type (1)

containing a low concentration of silane in a carrier gas
selected from the group consisting of Ar, He, this

concentration being compatible with the safety
concentration limits of silane in the said carrier gas; 
b) the mixture obtained at the outlet from the membranous
module (6) is then directed to a point of use where the

required concentration of silane is higher than that in the
storage vessel of stage a).
