<ABSTRACT>
A toilet article, such as a mirror or the like, has an element (1) made of a polymer material and an insert (9) fixed therto. In order to permanently fasten the insert (9) to a support made of polymer material (1) at a low cost, the element (1) designed as a wall (4) has several undercut points or sections (3 or 4), or at least a continuous undercut (3 or 4), which form-fittingly and frictionally retain or surround the insert (9). The insert (9) is coupled to the polymer toilet element (1) by shrinkage.

A toilet article such as a mirror, soaptin, toothbrush holder, tooth 
glass or the like, having an article part (1) made of polymeric material 

as a wall part, in particular a rear wall, with an insert part (9) 
connected firmly to it, the insert part (9) exhibiting overhanging keeper 

extensions (12) which overlap an inlaid part (13), in particular a piece 
of mirror, and locate this inlaid part (13) without or with little play,
 
characterized in that
 
the article part (1) exhibits undercuts (3, 4) at certain points or sections 

or at least one undercut (3, 4) running right round, which seize 
and embrace the insert part (9) frictionally and positively by the insert 

part (9) being connected to the polymeric article part (1) by shrinkage. 
A toilet article as in Claim 1, characterized in that 
in the region of the keeper extensions (12) the insert part (9) rests 

against a bearer ridge (14) on the article part (1). 
A toilet article as in Claim 2, characterized in that 
the bearer ridge (14) is made as the means of location of the inlaid 

part (13) and/or the insert part (9). 
A toilet article as in one of the Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the reentrant edge or edges (7) of the undercut (3, 4) is/are 

offset with respect to the non-reeentrant edge or edges (8) of the undercut 
(3, 4) by 0.05 to 0.4 mm. 
A toilet article as in one of the Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the height (10) of the wall (4) resting against the insert 

part (9) is greater than the thickness (11) of the insert part (9) in the 
region of the undercut (3, 4). 
A toilet article as in one of the Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the wall (4) of the undercut (3, 4) resting against the 

insert part (9) is made continuous or stepped from the bearer base (5) 
and straight or with a concave curvature. 
A toilet article as in one of the Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that onto one wall of the article part (1), in particular a rear 

wall (15), is moulded a support-strut (16) provided with stiffening-ribs  
 

(18) and that the stiffening-ribs (18) end or are interrupted in a 
direction across the length (17) of the strut to form a point of bend or 

a hinge (19). 
A toilet article as in Claim 7, characterized in that 
the thickness of material in the region of the point of bend or of 

the hinge (19) amounts to 0.2 to 0.6 mm, especially about 0.4 mm. 
A toilet article as in Claim 7 or 8, characterized in that 
at least one stop-block (20) standing out in the region of the point 

of bend or the hinge (19) is provided for limiting the outward movement 
of the support-strut (16). 
A toilet article as in Claim 9, characterized in that 
the stop-block or stop-blocks (20) is/are formed by the edges (21) at 

the ends of the stiffening-ribs (18).
