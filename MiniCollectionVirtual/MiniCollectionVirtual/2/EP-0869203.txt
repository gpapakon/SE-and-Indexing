<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to provide a
fluoride crystal having a high transmittance with

respect to an excimer laser and an excellent resistance
with respect to a high output laser, and a production

method thereof. The fluoride crystal of the present
invention contains at least one kind of atom selected

from the group consisting of Zn, Cd, Pb, Li, Bi and Na
with a content of 10 ppm or less, and having an

internal transmittance of 70% or more with respect to a
135 nm wavelength light. The method of the present

invention of producing a fluoride crystal comprises
conducting a refining step of adding a scavenger to a

calcium fluoride raw material and refining the raw
material at least once, and a crystal growth step of

further adding the scavenger to the refined raw
material and growing a crystal by using a crucible

lowering method, wherein the amount of the scavenger to
be added in the first refining step is 0.04 to 0.1 mol

% based on the raw material, and the total amount of
the scavenger to be added in the subsequent refining

steps and the crystal growth step is 10% to 50% based
on the amount of the scavenger to be added in the first

refining step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a calcium fluoride
crystal, an optical article for an excimer laser using
the calcium fluoride crystal, and a method of producing the calcium
fluoride crystal.An excimer laser attracts attention as only one
high output laser to oscillate outside an ultraviolet
region so that the application thereof is expected in
the electronic industry, chemical industry, and energy
industry.Specifically, the excimer laser is used in
processing metals, resins, glass, ceramics and
semiconductors, and in a chemical reaction.An apparatus for generating an excimer laser beam
is known as an excimer laser oscillating apparatus. A
laser gas filled in a chamber such as Ar, Kr, Xe, F2,
Cl2 is excited by electron beam radiation or electric
discharge. The excited atoms bond with atoms being in
a ground state to produce a molecule existing only in
an excited state. The produced molecule is called
"excimer". Due to its instability, the excimer
immediately discharges an ultraviolet ray and falls 
into the ground state. This phenomenon is called "bond
free transition". An apparatus for taking out a laser
beam by amplifying the ultraviolet ray obtained by the
transition in an optical resonator comprising a pair of
mirrors is an excimer oscillating apparatus.Among excimer laser beams, a KrF laser and an ArF
laser are a light having a wavelength of 248 nm and a
light having a wavelength of 193 nm in a vacuum
ultraviolet region, respectively. Therefore, a glass
material having a high transmittance with respect to
the light having these wavelengths must be used in an
optical system. Fluorites (i.e., calcium fluoride
crystals) are preferable as the glass material for the
optical system.The method of producing a fluorite which has been
conducted by the present inventors will be explained
below. FIGS. 9A to 9D are schematic views showing the
steps of the method of producing a fluorite crystal
which has been conducted by the present inventors.In the step of FIG. 9A, a powdered raw material is
placed in a container. In the step of FIG. 9B, the
material placed in the container is melted and then
cooled. In the step of FIG. 9C, solidified
agglomerates are pulverized with a pulverizer made of
stainless steel. In the step of FIG. 9D, a fluorite
block is produced by melting and gradually cooling the
pulverized agglomerates placed in a crucible for 
crystal growth.The step of FIG. 9B is conducted for reducing the
change of a bulk density before and after melting in
the step of FIG. 9D, and further for removing
impurit
