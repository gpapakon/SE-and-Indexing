<ABSTRACT>
Article hold up apparatus is provided for use with an 
elongate lane (12) for transporting a plurality of articles (15) 

received in a facewise nested condition from a first location at 
one end (16) of the lane (12) along the lane until a leading end 

of the articles (15) reaches an opposite end (26) of the lane 
(12), for retaining a leading one of the articles (15) in a 

substantially coaxial facewise nested orientation with respect 
to the others of the articles (15) for thereby retaining the 

articles (15) being transported along the lane (12) substantially 
in said facewise nested condition. The article hold up apparatus 

comprises air directing structure (40) extending substantially 
the length of the elongate lane (12) for directing air in a 

direction generally opposite a direction of travel (18) of the 
articles (15) along the lane (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed generally to the article 
handling arts and more particularly to a novel and improved 
article hold up apparatus for maintaining a group of articles in 
a facewise nested condition as the articles are transported along 
an elongate lane. While the apparatus of the invention may find utility 
in other applications, the disclosure will be facilitated by 
particular reference to the handling of can ends during their 
fabrication and/or subsequent use as closures for can bodies. 
In the manufacture and filling of containers such as beverage 
cans or the like, a great number of can end parts are required. 
Modern fabrication and filling operations require that can ends 
be provided at a high rate of speed in a more or less continuous 
process. A number of individual processing steps are utilized 
in fabricating the can ends prior to their eventual use as 
closures.  
 In this regard, the can ends are often packaged and 
shipped to the final end user, although in some instances, the 
fabricator may also be the end user. The fabrication of can ends 
requires a number of steps including initial stamping or 
formation of the ends from suitable aluminum or other material 
or blanks, the formulation of suitable scoring for a tear away 
top portion and application of a graspable tab, ring or the like, 
as well as the adding of suitable liner materials as may be 
required for various applications. Such liners may be required 
to effect "repair" or assure the integrity of the end after the 
scoring and tab applying operation, or may be required as a 
condition of packaging for various products. In the can end fabricating operation, can ends are 
generally fed from one station to the next in a more or less 
continuous flow in an endwise or facewise stacked or nested 
condition. Where can ends are to be packaged for shipment to a 
final user and unpackaged by the final user, the ends are 
generally provided in stacks or "sticks" as they are called in 
the art, of a predetermined number or length of ends in facewise 
nested condition. However, during the handling of ends between one 
station and another in a fabricating or filling process, many 
instances arise in which a leading end of a flow or stream of can 
ends must be introduced to a portion of the processing apparatus. 
That is, a discontinuity occurs in the otherwise continuous flow 
of can ends. When such a discontinuity occurs, some means must 
be provided to assure that leading ones of the ends in the 
incoming stream are maintained

An article hold up apparatus, for use with an elongate lane (12) for transporting a 
plurality of articles (15) received in a facewise nested condition from a first location at one end 

(16) of said lane (12) along the lane until a leading end of said articles (15) reaches an opposite 
end (26) of said lane, and for retaining said articles (15) in a substantially coaxial facewise nested 

orientation with respect to the others of said articles for thereby retaining the articles (15) being 
transported along said lane (12) substantially in said facewise nested condition, said article hold 

up apparatus being characterised by: an air directing structure (40) extending substantially the 
length of said elongate lane (12) for directing air in a selected direction along said lane (12); said 

air directing structure including at least one elongate tubular duct (42) extending longitudinally 
along a portion of the length of said lane (12) and having a plurality of air directors (46) for 

directing air in said selected direction to impinge upon said articles (15). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, being further characterised by a blower (60) for 
supplying a stream of air, and an air delivery structure (56, 66) for delivering said stream of air 

from said blower (60) to said directing structure (40). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 being further characterised by said air directing 
structure (40) having a pair (42, 44) of elongate, generally tubular ducts, each extending along 

one side of said elongate lane (12) and a plurality of openings (46) in said ducts configured for 
directing air in a selected direction along said lane (12). 
Apparatus according to Claim 3, being further characterised by said ducts (42, 44) 
being generally rectangular in cross-section and said openings (46) includes a plurality of spaced, 

coaxially aligned lance members (52) formed along the length of each said duct on a side thereof 
facing said lane (12).  

 
Apparatus according to Claim 4, being further characterised by said spaced, coaxially 
aligned lance members (52) located on sides of each of said ducts (42, 44) facing oppositely from 

said side thereof facing said lane for simultaneously directing air toward a second similar 
elongate lane arranged in a parallel, side-by-side condition with said first-mentioned lane (12). 
Apparatus according to Claim 2, being further characterised by said air delivery 
structure having a manifold (66) coupled with said blower (60) and a plurality of conduits (56) 

for delivering air from a manifold (66) to said air directing structure (40). 
Apparatus according to Claim 6, being further characterised by said air directing 
structure (70) having a pair of elongate, generally tubular ducts (42, 44), each extending along 

one side of said elongate lane for a portion of the length thereof and said air directing structure 
including a plurality of openings (56) in said ducts configured for directing air in a selected 

direction along said lane. 
Apparatus according to Claim 7, being further characterised by said hold up apparatus 
having a plurality of said pairs of ducts (42, 44) arranged adjacent a plurality of similar, parallel, 

side-by-side elongate lanes (12) and wherein said plurality of conduits (56) are operatively 
coupled for delivering air from said manifold (16) to each of said ducts (42, 44). 
Apparatus according to Claim 7 or Claim 8, being further characterised by said 
plurality of conduits (56) being operatively coupled for delivering air from said manif
old (66) 
to a plurality of locations along the length of each of said ducts (42, 44).
