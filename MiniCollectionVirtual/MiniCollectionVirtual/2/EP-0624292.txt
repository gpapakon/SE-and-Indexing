<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the
measurement of cable pair AC and DC characteristics,
as is normally required for the maintenance of
telephone, cable television, communications, data,
and computer networks.Finding economical and efficient ways of
testing the cables used in distributed networks (e.g.
telephone systems) has been a problem since the first
use of such networks. Prior to the present
invention, all testing methods could be represented
generically by the configuration shown in Figure 1.
A test set had to be connected to the cable at each
end. Testing was then done by exchanging signals
between them. Typically, a far end set 1 would
transmit a signal and a near end set 2 would measure
it. The data would then be recorded by an individual
located at the near end. The test set 1, located at
the far end, would be operated by an operator who had
traveled to the far end, or would be controlled from
the near end by an automatic device. Since typical
telephone networks normally consist of many cables
emanating from the near end (central telephone
office) to many separate far ends (subscribers),
these prior art methods normally require many
separate far end test sets.It was recognized in the prior art that
traveling to the far end for testing was undesirable
and, consequently, various prior art methods were
employed for connecting and controlling the far end 
test set automatically in order to eliminate the need for a trip to the far end for
testing. The principal difficulty with these prior art methods, however, was that
they were both costly and complex, and they nevertheless, still had to have a test
set and controller or operator waiting at each far end location.An early attempt to address this problem can be found in US-A-3660620
(Schimpf). This document describes a system for measuring the
transmission loss on a communications line, wherein a diode network is connected
at the far end to act as a non-linear circuit element.An excitation signal is applied to the near end of the line to drive the
diode network into its non-linear region, and then a test signal is also applied at
a much lower amplitude. The non-linearity of the diode causes this second signal
to be modulated resulting in signal sidebands. These sidebands are then filtered
out and measured at the new end. This arrangement has the problem that the filter
used to filter the sideband signals must be variable, and that the returned signal is
always near in frequency to the test signal, thus resulting in complex filter design.According
