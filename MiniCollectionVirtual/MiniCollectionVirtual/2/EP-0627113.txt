<ABSTRACT>
Data medium recording-reading system in which groups (G0) of positive continuous component tracks (G1) and negative continuous component tracks are distributed on the track. During reading, the different signal values are integrated for each track. Then a first addition circuit (S1) adds the integration results of the first tracks of each track group, then a second addition circuit (S2) adds the integration results of the last tracks of each track group. A comparator (CD) compares the addition results of both addition circuits to correct tracking. Applications in high density data medium reading.
