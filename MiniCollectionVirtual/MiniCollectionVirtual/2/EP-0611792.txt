<ABSTRACT>
A method for modifying the surface characteristics 
of a polymeric material by irradiating a surface of the 

polymeric material in the presence of oxygen and then 
grafting acrylamide to the irradiated surface by 

contacting the irradiated surface with an aqueous 
solution including acrylamide monomer and ceric ion. 

Grafted polymer surfaces with dense surface coverage are 
produced without using a deaerated monomer solution. 

Biofunctional molecules can be ionically or covalently 
bonded to the grafted surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
grafting acrylamide onto an polymeric substrate. The
invention also relates to a method for improving
biocompatibility of polymeric surfaces.The grafting of a polymer to a polymeric substrate
depends on the creation of active sites on the
substrate. In general, there are three approaches to
creating these active sites so that graft polymerization
can occur: chain-transfer activation, radiation or
photochemical activation, and chemical activation. Both
chain transfer and chemical activation can be applied to
either radical or ionic graft
polymerization methods.Activation grafting is the creation of active sites
on the substrate by the absorption of radiant energy.
Gamma radiation, ultraviolet radiation, corona
discharge, radio frequency glow discharge, electron beam
radiation or other high energy radiation can be used as
the energy source. The activation can be conducted as
preirradiation of the polymeric substrate or as mutual
irradiation of the polymeric substrate and the monomer
to be grafted. By either method, the rate and
efficiency of the initiation is dependent upon the type
of radiation, the radiation dose (total energy
absorbed), the dose rate (rate at which energy is
absorbed), and the radiation sensitivity of materials
involved. For an example of this method, in US-A-3826678
(Hoffman et al.), a polymeric substrate is
subjected to radiation and thereafter is exposed to a
deaerated monomer solution which covalently bonds the
monomer to the irradiated surface to produce a surface
with improved biocompatibility. Also, for example,
Ikada ("Surface Modification of Silicones for Tissue 
Adhesion" Biomaterials and Clinical Applications,
Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam, 1987) use
corona discharge to activate surfaces followed by
grafting by application of a deaerated aqueous solution
of monomers. Also, graft polymerization of acrylamide
onto the surface of films preirradiated with UV
radiation is described, for example, by Uyama et al.,
Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 36(5): 1087-1096,
1988. Also, for example, in US-A-5080924 (Kamel et
al.), radio frequency glow discharge is used to treat a
polymeric surface followed by contacting the treated
surface with compounds such as acrylic acid in vapor
phase to graft pendant carboxyl or amine groups to the
polymeric substrate, thereby improving its
biocompatibility. However, the effectiveness of
radiation grafting to impart improved biocompatibility
to some substrates can be quite limited.
