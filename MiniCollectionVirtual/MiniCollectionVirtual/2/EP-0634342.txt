<ABSTRACT>
A limited entry unit dosage package is provided, 
which mandates the completion of a sequence of steps to 

access single unit dosages within depressions on the 
package. The user grips a trapezoidal section of an 

access tab (30) to expose a finger depression (36). The user 
thereafter grips a cover overlying a depression which 

contains the unit dosage form. This cover is pulled back 
thereby exposing the unit dosage. This unit dosage is 

sealed from access by children, as well as sealed from air 
and liquids.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to packaging 
of unit-dosage drug formulations, and more particularly in 
providing a package that both satisfies the U.S. Poison 
Prevention Packaging Act regarding child-resistance, and 
provides a safe, sturdy, and economical package for the 
transport and dispensing of drug formulations. Recent Federal legislation has been enacted requiring 
manufacturers to provide child-resistant packaging. The 
U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act was enacted to 
safeguard children from self-administering pharmaceuticals 
that may pose a danger to them. The marketplace contains 
many children's formulations that are made to be 
palatable, but with the unfortunate side-effect that this 
predisposes children to believing that any pills or 
liquids in bottles will taste good, and do not present a 
danger. It is desirable to provide a package form that is 
both easy to use for adults, protective for the 
pharmaceutical within, and difficult for children to open. 
The package of the present invention is easy to open for 
an adult, access being facilitated by entry at discrete 
points, with many steps necessary to access the drug form 
within. This method of access is both obvious to an 
adult, yet inhibitory to a child. The material forming 
the blister package is sufficiently strong such that even 
an adult would have great difficulty in tearing it without 
utilizing the prearranged scheme for tearing across the 
perforated score lines. The blister package is sturdy  
 
enough for fragile drug forms, provides protection from 
physical stresses, and is also moisture resistant. These 
considerations are important for pharmaceuticals formed by 
lyophilization, or "freeze-drying". The dosage form may 
be a capsule, tablet, Gelcap™ capsule or the like. The 
invention is also comprised of a water-tight lidding 
sheet, which must be peeled back to expose the dosage form 
within. Access to the fragile drug forms is inhibited to 
children by allowing for only limited entry points on the 
blister package, combined with sequential performance of 
a number of steps to obtain access to a single dosage 
form. The present invention relates to a child-resistant 
package strong enough to protect fragile dosage unit 
against damage and moisture, convenient for individual 
dosage unit transport, and of limited access, thereby 
inhibiting opening of the package by children. It is 
therefore an object of the present invention to provide a 
package that offers protection against transportation

A package for holding a plurality of tablets 
comprising: 

   a sheet containing a plurality of depressions, each 
depression adapted to hold at least one tablet, 

   a cover for sealing to said sheet around each said 
depression, said cover divided into discrete subdivisions 

surrounding each depression so that each subdivision has 
a predetermined width and length; 

   an adhesive layer for attaching said sheet to said 
cover around said depressions so that said cover seals 

said depressions; and 
   an access tab maintained on said sheet in spaced 

apart relation to said depression, said access tab 
abutting a said cover, and said access tab having a width 

equal to the width of said cover and a length which varies 
along said cover width so that said access tab forms a 

generally trapezoidal portion extending from a generally 
rectangular portion, and said access tab sealed to said 

sheet in the area of said rectangular portion but not in 
the area of said trapezoidal portion. 
The package of claim 1 wherein said rectangular 
portion and the portion of said cover abutting said 

rectangular portion form a seal about a finger depression 
in said sheet, so that when said access tab is removed 

from said sheet, a portion of said finger depression is 
exposed, and a portion of said cover is manipulable within 

said finger depression. 
The package of claim 1 wherein said depressions are 
circular in shape. 
The package of claim 2 wherein said finger depressions 
are generally oval in shape. 
The package of claim 2 wherein said depressions are 
arranged linearly. 
The package of claim 5 wherein there are at least two 
rows of said depressions which are arranged along a linear 

intersection. 
The package of claim 6 wherein said finger depressions 
face one another at the intersection of said two rows. 
The package of claim 6 wherein said finger depressions 
are spaced apart from the intersection. 
The package of claim 1 wherein the portion of said 
cover overlaying a said depression is generally 

rectangular in shape. 
The package of claim 1 wherein said depressions are 
capsule-shaped.
