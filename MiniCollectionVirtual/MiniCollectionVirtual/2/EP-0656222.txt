<ABSTRACT>
The weight (37) for altering the radial distance from the pivot axle (22) is freely movable by gravity. When the passenger-gondola is stationary, the weight is beneath the pivot axle. The weight moves along a line connecting (31) the pivot axle and a line running parallel to the pivot axle through the centre of gravity of the gondola. The weight is in the form of a fluid mass, esp. oil or water contained in a tank (30) attached to the gondola. A wider part (30b) of the tank is limited by a wall running in a circle segment shape around the pivot axle.

<CLAIMS>
Ride for funfairs or amusement parks, having at least one
passenger gondola (23) which is mounted to be pivotable about a

pivot axis (22) inclined with respect to the ground vertical and
in particular substantially horizontal, and having a weight (37)

which influences the pivoting movement and is movable with
variation of its radial distance from the pivot axis (22),

characterised in that the weight (37) for influencing the
turning-over of the passenger gondola (32) is arranged to be

freely movable through the influence of gravity.
Ride according to Claim 1, characterised in that the weight
(37) is movable along a path leading through the pivot axis (22)

or past it and is thus movable on both sides of the pivot axis
(22).
Ride according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that, in
the rest position of the passenger gondola (23), the weight (37)

is in a rest position substantially below the pivot axis (22).
Ride according to Claims 2 and 3, characterised in that the
distance of the rest position from the pivot axis (22) is

greater than the distance of the opposite end position of the
weight, on turning over, from the pivot axis (22). 
Ride according to Claim 3 or 4, characterised in that this
rest position lies in the region of the pendulum centre of

gravity of the passenger gondola (23).
Ride according to at least one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the weight (37) is movable along a

connecting line (31) of pivot axis (22) and a line running
parallel to the pivot axis (22) through the centre of gravity of

the passenger gondola (23).
Ride according to at least one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the weight is a fluid mass (37), in

particular an oil or water mass, which is filled into a liquid
tank (30) substantially fixedly connected to the passenger

gondola (23) or forming a part of the passenger gondola (23),
the liquid tank having a greater volume than the fluid mass (37)

and being shaped in such a way that the fluid mass (37) varies
its radial distance from the pivot axis (22) between different

rotary positions of the passenger gondola (23) through the
influence of gravity.
Ride according to Claims 3 and 7, characterised in that the
liquid tank (30) widens in the region of the rest position of

the fluid mass (37).
Ride according to Claim 8, characterised in that the
widened portion (30b) of the liquid tank (30) is bounded by a

wall (36) running substantially in the shape of an arc of a
circle about the pivot axis (22). 
Ride according to Claim 8 or 9, characterised in that the
remaining portion (30a), which adjoins the widened portion (30b)

and extends substantially in the direction of the pivot axis
(22), of the liquid tank (30) has a substantially constant

cross-section.
Ride according to at least one of Claims 7 to 10, in which
the passenger gondola (23) is seated on at least one pendulum

arm, characterised in that the pendulum arm is formed
substantially by the liquid tank (30) (Fig. 3).
Ride according to at least one of Claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that the passenger gondola (23) is constructed

in such a way that the pivot axis (22) runs substantially
through the head (26a) of the passenger (26) situated in the

passenger gondola (23).
Ride according to at least one of Claims 1 to 12,
characterised by a rotatable and drivable central structure (3)

which pivotably supports at its periphery a plurality of jibs
(15) which extend radially outwards in the shape of a star and

from which the passenger gondolas (23) are suspended in pendulum
fashion, and by an eccentric device (8) which, in operation,

pivots the jibs (15) into alternating high and oblique
positions.
Ride according to Claim 13, characterised in that the
passenger gondolas (23) are fitted with passenger seats directed

radially outwards.
