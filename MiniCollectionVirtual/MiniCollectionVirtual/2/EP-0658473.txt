<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for adjusting biasing 
springs in 

a cantilever brake. A conventional apparatus for adjusting the biasing 
springs 

includes disks each engaging one leg of each spring, and adjusting 
screws each 

meshed with a proximal end of a brake caliper (1) for contacting one 
of the disks. 

In the present invention, each biasing spring (6) is engaged 
with a spring cover (7) to which an adjusting screw (8) is attached.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bicycle brake according to the preamble of
claim 1.A known bicycle brake includes brake calipers supporting brake shoes for
contacting a rim of a bicycle wheel, and a biasing device such as springs for
biasing the brake calipers in directions to move the brake shoes away from the
rim.A fine adjustment may be made to the biasing force of the springs to effect a fine
adjustment of a spacing between the brake shoes and the rim.Such a line adjustment is made by an apparatus as disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
4,754,853, for example. This brake includes brake calipers pivotally supported on
brackets extending forward from bicycle frames, springs for applying a biasing
force to the brake calipers, and a device for adjusting the biasing force of each
spring. This adjusting device includes a disk rotatably attached to each bracket
and engaging one leg of each spring, and an adjusting screw meshed with a bore
formed in each brake caliper for contacting the disk. This brake further includes
covers substantially enclosing the biasing springs to protect the springs and to
provide an improved outward appearance.The prior brake requires, besides the adjusting screws, the disks for engaging the
legs of the springs, which increase the number of components and complicate the
construction and assembly work. This results in the disadvantage of a relatively
high cost. Having regard to the disadvantage of the prior art noted above, a bicycle brake is
provided comprising the features of claim 1.Thus, the present invention dispenses with the disks by fixing one end of each
biasing spring to one of the covers required in this type of brake. This results in a
reduced number of components, and contributes to low cost and labor saving in
assembling the components.Further and other objects, features and effects of the invention will become more
apparent from the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the
invention taken with reference to the accompanying drawings.

<CLAIMS>
A bicycle brake attachable to a bracket fixed to a bicycle frame and having a
longitudinal axis (X), said bicycle brake comprising:


a brake caliper (1) adapted to be pivotally supported
about the axis (X)

by said bracket for
supporting a brake shoe (5) and;
a cover (7) adapted to be pivotally supported by said bracket and extending
parallel to said longitudinal axis (X) for defining a space with said bracket;
a biasing spring (6) mounted in said space, and having one leg (6b) thereof
attachable to said bracket and the other leg (6a) attached to said cover (7) for

biasing said brake caliper; and
adjusting means (8, 9) for adjusting tension of said biasing spring (6);
characterized in that
 said cover (7) is movable relative to said brake
caliper (1) and that said adjusting means includes an adjusting screw (8)

attached to one of said cover (7) and said brake caliper (1), and a contact
portion (9) formed on the other of said cover (7) and said brake caliper (1) for

contacting said adjusting screw (8) such that said cover (7) contacts said
brake caliper (1) through said adjusting screw (8) and said contact portion

thereby the force of said biasing spring (6) is transmitted through said cover
(7)to said brake caliper (1).
A bicycle brake as defined in claim 1, characterized in that said adjusting
screw (8) is attached to said cover (7), and said contact portion (9) is formed on said brake

caliper (1).
A bicycle brake as defined in claim 1, characterized in that said adjusting
screw (8) is attached to said brake caliper (1), and said contact portion (9) is formed on

said cover (7).
A bicycle brake as defined in claim 2 or 3, characterized in that said
brake caliper includes a cylindrical portion (1b) extending longitudinally of a bicycle, 

said contact portion being a contact projection (9) extending radially outwardly of
an axis of said cylindrical portion (1b).
A bicycle brake as defined in claim 4, characterized in that said
cover (7) defines a cutout (7d) corresponding to said contact projection (9).
A bicycle brake as defined in claim 5, characterized in that said
cover (7) has a cylindrical overall configuration defining an end surface (7b) extending

radially of an axis of said cylindrical configuration, said end surface including a
bore and said cutout (7d) having dimensions corresponding to said cylindrical portion.
A bicycle brake as defined in claim 5, characterized in that said biasing
spring (6) is received by a screw holder (7e) formed in said cover (7) adjacent said end

surface (7b).
A bicycle brake as defined in claim 6, characterized in that said end surface (7b)
includes a bore (7c) for receiving a leg (6a) of said biasing spring (6).
