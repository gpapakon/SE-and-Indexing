Winding machine for paper or board webs (1), 
having a slitting device (6) for dividing the web (1) 

into individual webs and having a driven supporting or 
carrier roll (5) which rotates the wound reels (3, 16) 

resting thereon during winding up, characterized in that, 
on each long side of the winding machine there is 

arranged at least one additional circumferential drive 
(17, 18) for the two outer wound reels (16), hereinafter 

also designated edge reels, the said drive comprising a 
roll (19, 20) or belt which can be pressed, approximately 

radially in relation to the supporting or carrier roll 
(5), resiliently against the respective edge reel (16), 

which is provided with its own rotary drive and whose 
axis of rotation runs parallel to the axis of the supporting 

or carrier roll (5). 
Winding machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the circumferential drives (17, 18) 

can be moved transversely to the web running direction. 
Winding machine according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the surface, which can be rested on 

the edge reels (16), of the rolls (19, 20) or of the belt 
is resilient and has grooves. 
Winding machine according to one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the circumferential drive (17, 

18) comprises a roll (19, 20) which can be pivoted 
against the edge reel (16) and has an integrated drum 

drive. 
Winding machine according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that over the working width there is  

 
arranged a series of pressure rollers (15) which can be 

pressed individually circumferentially against the wound 
reels (3), the two outer pressure rollers (15) which can 

be pressed against the edge reels (16) being connected to 
a disconnectable rotary drive and the other pressure 

rollers being freely rotatably mounted. 
Winding machine according to one of Claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that on both sides of the driven 

supporting or carrier rolls (5) there are arranged 
winding stations for the individual webs, each winding 

station comprising two winding stands (8) which can be 
moved transversely to the web running direction and on 

which there is mounted a freely rotatable guide head (7) 
which can be driven into the winding core, the webs (1) 

being fed alternately to the two winding lines on each 
side of 
the supporting or carrier roll (5), and in that 
an additional circumferential drive (17, 18) is in each 

case arranged on the two long sides of each winding line. 
Winding machine according to one of Claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the width, measured in each case 

transversely to the web running direction, of the 
supporting or carrier roll (5) is more than 5 m and the 

width of the driven rolls (19, 20) or belts is between 
300 mm and 700 mm, preferably between 400 mm and 500 mm.
