<ABSTRACT>
2.1 The safety of bacterial live vaccine strains is guaranteed by deletions whose stability in respect of in vivo repair is in the order of about 10
<
-12
>
. The stringent requirements of the World Health Organisation and the widespread opinion about the alleged lack of safety on use of live vaccines under practical conditions make it appear necessary to increase the safety margin existing now by a further increase by at least a factor of 10
<
-7
>
. 2.2 The stability of a live vaccine prepared from at least one metabolic drift-attenuated, immunogenic, stable, single or multiple marker live vaccine strain with or without envelope mutation and an optimal degree of attenuation adapted to the susceptibility of the host species is increased using as vaccine strain its revertant which, as suppressor mutant, also has the attenuation and/or envelope markers. 2.3 Various variants of the live vaccine and a specific live vaccine for fowls and chicks and the production thereof are indicated.
