<ABSTRACT>
An excavator, backhoe, front loader or the like is converted for 
breaking reinforced concrete and other materials by removing the 

bucket, fitting an auxiliary mounting point (72,110) under the 
articulated excavator arm (44) about twice as far from the crowd 

link (54,80) as the bucket mounting point (50) is from the crowd 
link, and fitting a first jaw member (76,106) thereto. A second 

opposed jaw member (78,108) is added, braced by a stay bar (82,126) 
or a hydraulic cylinder (136), to form jaws with about twice the 

power of jaws mounted conventionally at the bucket mounting point, 
using the standard actuator (52), crowd link (54) and stabiliser 

link (56) of the excavator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to materials breaking apparatus, and in 
particular to apparatus for breaking materials such as reinforced 
concrete, which apparatus is suitable for mounting on the 
articulated arm of an excavator or the like. Breaking in this 
context may include crushing and/or shearing. Concrete may be 
crushed and steel bars may be sheared, using different embodiments 
of the invention. Digging and materials handling machines such as 360Â° excavators are 
very versatile and are commonly used for many different purposes in 
addition to their prime function of digging. They are typically 
tracked vehicles with multiple hydraulic power supplies for a boom, 
which can be raised and lowered and swung from side to side, and an 
arm pivoted so that it can be raised and lowered on the end of the 
boom. The distant end of the arm in turn conventionally carries a 
digging bucket, which can be pivoted or "crowded" about a 
horizontal pivot axis where it is mounted on the end of the arm. The bucket is normally powered by a hydraulic actuator, which may 
be referred to as the bucket ram, whose cylinder is mounted on the 
arm and whose piston rod extends to a crowd link which in turn is 
pivotally connected to a mounting point on the bucket. The 
connection between the piston rod and the crowd link is supported 
by a stabiliser link to the arm. Each of the crowd link and 
stabiliser link normally comprises a parallel pair of link members, 
one opposite the other on each side of the centre line of the 
equipment, for strength.  The pivot mounting at the end of the arm is often used for 
alternative attachments in place of the bucket. These may include 
concrete breaking jaws. Typically, the upper jaw replaces the 
bucket, and the lower jaw, which is mounted on the same pivot 
point, is held stationary by a rigid stay bar connected to the 
underside of the arm. The stay bar may be adjustable so that the 
angle of the lower jaw can be set according to the task in hand. Alternative arrangements for breaking concrete and the like include 
the use of other paired jaw devices with independent power units 
intended to improve crushing efficiency or to meet particular 
requirements. Different jaw devices and jaw operating mechanisms 
have been proposed over many years to provide concrete breaking 
units suitable for replacing the digging bucket of an excavator or 
the like, to provide conversions of more power or convenience or 
both. One possible method of achieving more power would be to replace the 
bucket ram
