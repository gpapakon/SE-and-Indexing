<ABSTRACT>
An integrated circuit for use in the printhead of 
an ink jet printer includes an array circuit (44) for 

heating an ink reservoir to produce a pattern of ink 
jets, the array circuit including a plurality of 

resistor cells (39) arranged into rows and columns. A 
corresponding number of row and column lines are 

coupled to the integrated circuit array for selecting 
and energizing the resistor cells according to the 

desired printing pattern. An identification circuit 
(45) integrated into the same substrate as the array 

circuit includes one or more programmable paths, the 
programmable paths corresponding and coupled to each 

row line. The programmable paths each include the 
serial combination of a programmable fuse and an active 

device. The opposite end of the programmable paths are 
coupled together at a common node, which in turn is 

coupled to an output circuit for providing a single 
output signal in response to a polling of the row 

lines. The identification circuit can be programmed 
and polled without adversely affecting or energizing 

the array circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to ink jet
printers and, more particularly, to an integrated
circuit for the printhead of the ink jet printer,
wherein the integrated circuit contains a resistor
array and an identification circuit. A conventional chip
including a resistor array is known from US-A-4 929 969, which
forms the basis for the preamble of claim 1.Referring now to FIG. 1, shown therein is a print
cartridge 10 for an ink jet printer. The print
cartridge 10 contains ink reservoirs and the integrated
circuit (neither are shown in FIG. 1), a printhead 12,
a printhead opening or "orifice plate" 11 having a
plurality of nozzles for passing a plurality of ink
jets, and a flexible "tab" circuit 20 that allows for
electrical connection of the printhead 12 to the ink
jet printer in which the cartridge 10 is installed.
Thin film resistors in the integrated circuit resistor
array selectively boil ink in the ink reservoir to
produce a predetermined ink jet pattern. The placement
of the integrated circuit resistor array is best seen
in FIG. 3 and is described below.Referring now to FIG. 2, the printhead 12 and tab
circuit 20 are shown in greater detail. The tab
circuit 20 is a lead frame type of flexible ("flex")
circuit that generally comprises a flexible planar 
dielectric substrate or film having a metalization
pattern formed on one surface thereof by, for example,
sputter deposition and photolithographic etching. The
back side of the flex tab circuit 20 that contains the
metalization pattern is bonded to the integrated
circuit in the print cartridge 10 using integrated
circuit fabrication techniques. The front side of the
flex tab circuit 20 contains ground pads 25 and
interconnect pads 17 for electrical connection to the
ink jet printer. Also shown in FIG. 2 is further
detail of the orifice plate 11, which is surrounded by
insulating adhesive beads 35 for encapsulating the
interconnect conductive traces to the integrated
circuit in the printhead 12. The back side of the flex
tab circuit 20 is shown in greater detail in FIG. 3.
The metalization pattern on the back side of circuit 20
includes conductive traces 13 separated and insulated
by predetermined spaces 21. The conductive traces 13
connect the integrated circuit (shown generally at 15)
to the back side of the interconnect pads 17.The printhead 12 of the print cartridge 10 is
shown in greater detail in FIG. 4 along perspective
lines 4-4 of FIG. 2. The simplified cross-sectional of
view of FIG. 4 reveals the placement of the integrated
circuit 26,
