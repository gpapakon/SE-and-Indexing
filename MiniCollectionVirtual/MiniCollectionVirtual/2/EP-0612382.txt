Vehicle with a supercharged internal combustion 
engine (1) serving for vehicle operation by means of a 

supercharger (2), the supercharger (2) being 
mechanically driven by the internal combustion engine, 

with air-cooled friction brakes (8), particularly disk 
brakes, and with an air feed device for feeding a 

cooling air flow to the friction brakes via at least 
one air duct (4, 4b), a switchable air-directing 

flap (6) arranged in an air duct (4, 4a, 4b) guiding 
the conveyed air flow from the supercharger (2) 

belonging to the air feed device, which, at least 
during driving conditions connected with high output 

demands on the internal combustion engine (1), is 
located in a first switch position feeding the air flow 

to the internal combustion engine (1) and, during 
braking of the vehicle, is located in a second switch 

position, in which the air flow is separated from the 
internal combustion engine (1) and fed as a cooling air 

flow to the friction brakes (8), characterised by: 

a control apparatus (13) for the air-directing 
flap (6), to which are fed, on activation of the brake 

pedal (11) of the vehicle, a brake signal activated 
directly by the pedal or via a brake circuit switchable 

by mechanical, hydraulic or pneumatic linkages inserted 
after the brake pedal (11) and a power signal 

activated, on actuation of the gas pedal (16) of the 
vehicle, either directly by the pedal or via a power 

switch switchable by linkages inserted downstream of 
the pedal (signal outputs 14 and 15), and which 

switches the air-direction flap (6) in dependence on 
these signals, when the power signal is present always 

to the first switch position and when only the brake 
signal is present to the second switch position, and  

 
which by means of a retarding device on decrease of the 

brake signal and in the absence of a power signal 
temporarily retards the switching back of the air-direction 

flap (6) from the second to the first switch 
position, with reference to the point in time of the 

decrease of the brake signal; 
the air circulation gill being switched at the 
beginning of an activation of the friction brakes (8) 

to the second switch position and, at the end of the 
activation of the friction brakes (8), being switched 

back to the first switch position, an immediate 
switching back of the air-direction flap (6) to the 

first switch position resulting from the occurrence of 
an output demand on the internal combustion engine (1), 

terminating the temporary retardation. 
Vehicle according to claim 1, characterised by an 
automatic antilock and anti-skid system (19) for the 

vehicle wheels, the control apparatus (13) for the air-direction 
flap (6) determines the state of the vehicle 

from signals present in, and fed to it from, the 
antilock and anti-skid system (19). 
Vehicle according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterised by a direct or indirect monitoring of the 

temperature of the friction brakes (8), the second 
switch position of the air-direction flap (6) being 

achievable only on determining, by the temperature 
monitoring device (thermometer probe 18, signal line 

17, control apparatus 13), that the temperature of the 
friction brakes (8) exceeds a fixed threshold 

temperature . 
Vehicle according to claims 1 and 3, characterised 
in that the temperature monitoring device (thermometer  

 
probe 18, signal line 17, control apparatus 13), when 

the temperature of the friction brakes (8) exceeds a 
fixed threshold temperature, adjusts the air-direction 

flap (6) to the second switch position. 
Vehicle according to one or more of the previous 
claims, characterised in that the air-direction 

flap (6) is arranged in a section of the air duct 
(4, 4a, 4b) downstream of the supercharger air 

cooler (5). 
Vehicle according to one or more of the previous 
claims, characterised in that the supercharger is 

permanently mechanically driven by the internal 
combustion engine.
