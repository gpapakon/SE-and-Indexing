Control unit for a multiway valve, with two electromagnets 
(14, 14') arranged next to one another and each being assigned 

a valve member (7) to be actuated, wherein each electromagnet 
(14, 14') has a coil (15), with a yoke device (25) provided 

outside the coils (15) to conduct the magnetic fields, and with 
a manual operation device (47) which has two manually adjustable 

actuating tappets (53, 53'), each assigned to one of the valve 
members (7) and having longitudinal axes (54) coinciding with 

their direction of adjustment which pass with clearance the 
longitudinal axes (13) of the respectively-assigned valve member 

(7), characterized in that the valve members (7) are so arranged 
relative to one another that their longitudinal axes are offset 

relative to one another at right-angles to a reference plane (46) 
which runs parallel to the longitudinal axes (54) of the 

actuating tappets (53) and to the longitudinal axes (13) of the 
valve members (7). 
Control unit according to claim 1, characterized in that 
there is a locating device (63) by means of which one of the 

actuating tappets (53, 53') may be releasably fixed in the 
actuated position. 
Control unit according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
each valve member (7) operates in conjunction with a valve seat 

(8) which is located in a recess (49), wherein the actuating 
tappet (53) assigned to one valve member (7) is guided past the 

recess (49) assigned to the other valve member (7) without 
passing through it. 
Control unit according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the yoke device (25) has a yoke element (26) assigned 

jointly to both coils (15), so that the magnetic field of both 
coils (15) can pass through it.  

 
Control unit according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
yoke element (26) assigned jointly to both coils (15) is provided 

in the intermediate area between the adjacent coils (15). 
Control unit according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that 
the two coils (15) are arranged with parallel axes, and with 

circumferential surfaces (18) facing one another. 
Control unit according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
jointly-assigned yoke element (26) is plate-shaped, with each of 

the two plate surfaces (28) facing one of the two coils (15). 
Control unit according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in that 
the two coils (15) have no yoke device in the sections of their 

circumferential surfaces facing away from one another. 
Control unit according to any of claims 6 to 8, characterized 
in that each coil (15) is flanked, on at least one end and 

preferably at both ends, by a yoke section (35) connected to the 
jointly-assigned yoke element (26). 
Control unit according to claim 9, characterized in that the 
yoke device (25) has an H-configuration, wherein the central 

connecting piece of the H corresponds to the jointly-assigned 
yoke element (26), and the other four H sections to the end-face 

yoke sections (35). 
Control unit according to claim 10, characterized in that the 
two respective yoke sections (35) assigned to the ends of the two 

coils (15) facing the same axial side, are combined to form a 
yoke transverse element (32, 32'), which is attached to the 

assigned end of the separately formed, jointly-assigned yoke 
element (26).  

 
Control unit according to any of claims 3 to 11, 
characterized in that the end-face yoke sections (35) are plate-shaped. 
Control unit according to any of claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the yoke device (25) and the coils (15) are 

cast integrally with a housing (38). 
Control unit according to any of claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in that the two coils (15) are arranged above one 

another in the vertical direction (45) of the control unit (3), 
with their longitudinal axes (17) arranged offset to one another 

at right-angles to the reference plane (46) fixed by the vertical 
direction (45) and the longitudinal direction (12) of the control 

unit (3).
