<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a curable resin
composition for top coating, and more particularly to a
room temperature curable composition which has excellent
stain resistance and adhesion in addition to excellent
other properties such as weatherability and surface
properties and which is suitably applicable as top coat to
various articles such as buildings, household electric
appliances and industrial equipments made of various
materials such as metal, ceramics, glass, cement,
plastics, wood, paper and fiber.In order to improve appearance, corrosion
resistance, weatherability and the like, it has been
generally made to apply a paint, e.g. fluorocarbon resin
paint, acrylic urethane paint or acrylic silicon paint, to
surface of ceramic products, surface of buildings which
are composed of concrete, steel and the like, surface of
products for industrial use such as building materials,
and surfaces of other various products.On the other hand, in recent years, stain
resistance of paints used for the above purpose is
increasingly demanded from the viewpoints of worsening of
environment in and around towns and cities and rise in
consciousness of beauty or consciousness to maintain scene
or appearance.Among the paints as mentioned above, acrylic
silicone paints are superior in stain resistance, but are
still insufficient under severe environment.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a coating composition, particularly a coating
composition suitable for use in top coating, which has an
excellent stain resistance in addition to properties
required for coatings such as weatherability, adhesion,
surface smoothness, gloss and the like.A further object of the present invention is to
provide a curable resin composition for use as a top coat, 
which is curable at room temperature and provides coatings
having an excellent stain resistance and excellent other
properties such as appearance, gloss, adhesion and
weatherability.These and other objects of the present invention
will become apparent from the description hereinafter.It has been found that an acrylic copolymer
having a reactive silyl group such as alkoxysilyl group
provides a coating composition which is curable at room
temperature and can give coatings having excellent stain
resistance and adhesion in addition to excellent other
properties required for paints such as weatherability
comparable with that of known acrylic silicone paints,
appearance and gloss, when it is combined with a specific
hydrolyzable silicon compound, a specific curing
