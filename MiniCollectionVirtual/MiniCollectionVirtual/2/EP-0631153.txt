<ABSTRACT>
A radar system (20) has a chaotic code source 
(22) with a chaotic code output (23), which 

generates a chaotic code according to a chaotic 
difference equation. The radar system (20) further 

includes a transmitter (24) with a carrier signal 
source (28) of a carrier signal (29), and an encoder 

(30) having as a first input the carrier signal (29) 
of the carrier signal source (28) and as a second 

input the chaotic code output (23) of the chaotic 
code source (22), and as an output a transmitted 

radar signal (36) having the chaotic code output 
(23) encoded onto the carrier signal (29). A radar 

system receiver (26) includes a correlator (46) 
having as a first input the chaotic code output (23) 

of the chaotic code source (22) and as a second 
input a received radar signal (44), and as an output 

an indication of the correlation of the first and 
second inputs. The correlation is used to determine 

the distance, speed, or other characteristic of an 
object that reflected the radar signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a radar system,
and, more particularly, to a radar system in which
the waveform of the transmitted radar signal is
determined according to chaotic coding.In a radar system, a transmitter generates a
transmitted radar wave which is propagated through
free space. If the transmitted radar wave strikes
an object, a portion of its energy is scattered and
reflected from the object. A radar receiver has an
antenna that receives a portion of the reflected
energy. The received signal is analyzed to
determine some characteristic of the object that
reflected the radar wave, such as its distance or
speed.In many types of radar systems, the
transmitted radar signal is produced by encoding a
carrier signal with a code such as a binary code.
The code may be encoded onto the frequency, phase,
amplitude, or other characteristic of the carrier
signal. The coding is carried by the transmitted
and received radar signals, and the correlation of
the received code with the transmitted code serves
as the basis for obtaining information about the
object that reflects the radar wave.For example, if the wave form phase of the
transmitted radar signal is encoded with a time
series of a known type of code, that same code is
correlated to the wave form of the received radar
signal to determine the time interval between
transmission and receipt of the radar signal. The
time interval translates directly to a distance from
the transmitter to the object and thence to the 
receiver, since the propagation velocity of the
radar signal is at the constant speed of light. In
the common case where the radar transmitter and
receiver are at the same location, the radar signal
propagation distance is twice the distance between
the transmitter/receiver and the target.Great care is taken in selecting the form of
the code used to encode the radar signal. In many
cases, the code is a repetitive sequence of
individual binary pulses that is readily analyzed by
the radar receiver. The rate of repetition of the
sequence limits the maximum range of the radar,
because at greater ranges there can be uncertainty
as to which repetition is being matched to the
received signal. The repetition rate of the binary
pulses within the sequence determines the ranging
resolution of the radar, because the receiver cannot
resolve distances less than the distance associated
with one binary pulse width. The number and
character of the binary pulses within each sequence,
prior to repetition, determines in part the ability
of the radar to
