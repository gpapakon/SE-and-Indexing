A novel resin composite consists of a 
thermosetting resin or photosensitive resin and a 

thermoplastic resin and has a quasi-homogeneous 
compatible structure not only having properties inherent 

to the thermosetting or photosensitive resin but also

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cured resin
composite obtainable from a thermosetting resin and a
thermoplastic resin or a photosensitive resin and a
thermoplastic resin, and more particularly to a resin
composite consisting of an epoxy resin and
polyethersulphone (hereinafter abbreviated as PES) or a
so-called PES modified epoxy resin, or a resin composite
of an acrylated resin and polyether sulphone or a so-called
PES modified acrylated resin as well as a method of
producing the same.As the technique for the resin composite,
there is a typical technique of improving the properties
of a thermosetting resin by mixing the thermosetting
resin with a thermoplastic resin. For example, in the
mixed system (PES modified epoxy resin) of epoxy resin
and polyethersulphone (PES), the toughness of the epoxy
resin is improved by co-continuous two-phase structure
formed between the epoxy resin and PES (Keizo Yamanaka
and Takashi Inoue, Polymer, Vol. 30, p662 (1989)).In the above PES modified epoxy resin formed 
by mixing two resins, the toughness is improved as
compared with that of the epoxy resin alone because the
PES modified epoxy resin has a resin structure as
mentioned below. That is, in the mixed system of PES
and epoxy resin such as bisphenol A-type epoxy resin,
when it is cured at a high temperature,
the epoxy resin and PES
(compatible state) are not completely dissolved but
the thermosetting resin and the
thermoplastic resin are separately mixed through spinodal decomposition
(phase separating state). The latter case is
apparently a state of connecting spherical epoxy domains
to each other and regularly dispersing them into the
matrix of PES, which is a so-called co-continuous two-phase
structure between the epoxy resin and PES.The co-continuous two-phase structure is
formed by the phase separating state between the epoxy
resin and PES, and is a structure where
the spherical epoxy domains produced by spinodal
decomposition are merely dispersed into the PES matrix. Therefore, the
effect of dispersing PES into the epoxy resin is
developed, but the properties of PES itself can not be
enhanced. Because, when a glass transition temperature
of the composite having the co-continuous two-phase
structure is measured by the dynamic
viscoelasticity, two glass transition
temperature peaks are observed and hence it is considered 
that the interaction of the epoxy resin and PES as a
matrix is weak.The above knowledge on the co-continuous two-phase
structure is true in case of a mixed system of a
photosensitive resin and a
