<ABSTRACT>
The invention starts out from a combustion gas-producing installation, especially a hot water heating installation, having a suction fan (12) for the combustion gases and having one or more downstream heat exchangers (11, 14). In order to improve the safety of these installations and avoid the possibility of combustion gases causing damage, according to the invention the combustion chamber is assigned a vacuum gauge and, in addition, the suction fan (12) is arranged after the last heat exchanger (11, 14), seen in the flow direction of the combustion gases.

<CLAIMS>
System which generates combustion gases, esp. a hot
water boiler system, comprising a suction fan (12) for the

combustion gases and comprising one or more heat exchangers
(7, 8), which are traversed by the combustion gases, esp.

for the heating of floors, ceilings or walls and for the
preheating of combustion air, a low-pressure measurement

being effected internally of the combustion chamber,
characterised in that the suction fan (12) is disposed at

the end of the waste gas pipe behind the last heat
exchanger (11, 14) situated externally of the boiler, heat

exchangers being provided in the form of pipes, which are
laid in a snake-like manner and are disposed in a plane,

said pipes serving as floor, ceiling or wall heaters (7,
8).
System according to claim 1, characterised in that
the low-pressure measurement is effected in the wall region

facing the burner (2).
