Method of measuring the state of charge of a nickel-cadmium 
battery, consisting of: 


discharging the nickel-cadmium battery at a constant 
discharge current I; 
measuring the imaginary part Z
I
 of the complex 
impedance of the battery at a fixed frequency during 

the course of discharge; 
using the imaginary part Z
I
 measured in the course of 
discharge, or a quantity which is proportional thereto, 

as representative parameter of the state of charge 
of the battery; 
 
characterised in that the quantity used as representative 

parameter of the state of charge is calculated by the 
equation 


Γ = Z
I
⁻²f
-3/2
 
in which f is the said fixed frequency and Z
I
 is the 
imaginary part of the impedance measured at the said fixed 

frequency in the course of discharge. 
Method of measuring as claimed in Claim 1, characterised 
in that its validity is ensured, whatever the nominal 

capacity or the commercial source of the nickel-cadmium 
battery may be, by the adjustment of: 


the discharge current I as a function of the nominal 
capacity of the battery; 
the frequency f of the interfering signal as a  
 

function of the nominal capacity and of the discharge 
current; 
the value of the interference ΔI applied as a function 
of the discharge current I. 
Device permitting measurement of the state of charge 
of a nickel-cadmium battery, characterised in that it 

measures the complex impedance of the battery (3′) in the 
course of discharge, the device including an intensiostatic 

circuit (2′) which enables the battery under test to be 
discharged at a constant discharge current I and enables 

this discharge current to be superimposed on an alternating 
component at a fixed frequency, and further including a 

signal conditioner (5′) which permits conditioning of the 
signal at the terminals of the battery (3′), which consists 

of a direct current voltage from the battery and an alternating 
current voltage, and the signal consisting of the 

discharge current and the alternating current which is 
tapped at the terminals of a standard resistor (4′) in 

series with the battery (3′), sampler-blockers (6′) permitting 
sampling of the signals at the output of the conditioner 

(5′), a multiplexer (7′) permitting multiplexing of 
the signals at the output of the sampler-blockers (6′), 

analogue-digital converters (8′) permitting the conversion 
into digital values of the signals at the output of the 

multiplexer (7′) and test and control means (9′), the 
programme of which is stored in a memory (10′), permitting 

the necessary sequencing of the sampler-blockers (6′), of 
the multiplexer (7′) and of the analogue-digital converters 

(8′), the calculation of the imaginary part of the impedance 
from the digitised signals and the extraction of the value 

of the state of charge being carried out in accordance with 
the method as claimed in Claims 1 and 2. 
Device as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in that  
 

the intensiostatic circuit (2′) is replaced by the user 
apparatus functioning on the battery, in such a way that the 

discharge current I is fixed by the user apparatus itself. 
Device as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in that 
the sampler-blockers (6′) and the multiplexer (7′) are 

replaced by one single electronic component which makes it 
possible to have an output proportional to the imaginary 

part of the impedance from the two input signals (voltage 
and current). 
Device as claimed in Claim 3 or Claim 5, characterised 
in that the test and control part (block C) is replaced by a 

suitably programmed external calculation and test means. 
Device as claimed in any one of Claims 3 to 6, characterised 
in that the means for calculating the state of 

charge is integrated into the test and control part of the 
system functioning on the battery.
