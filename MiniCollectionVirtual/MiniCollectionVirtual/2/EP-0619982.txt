<ABSTRACT>
The anchor includes a body (14) and a plurality of barbs (44) 
located in axially aligned, circumferentially spaced 

relation to each other about the body. The barbs have 
a normal configuration wherein they extend rearwardly 

and radially outwardly from the anchor body to outer 
ends which are normally located outside a longitudinal 

projection of the largest geometric cross-section of 
the body transverse to its longitudinal axis. The 

barbs may be elastically deformed to a configuration 
wherein they are located substantially within the 

longitudinal projection. A transverse bore (26) extends 
through the front portion of the anchor for engagement 

by a length of cord-like material. Also, an opening (30) 
oriented perpendicularly to the bore extends through a 

flattened rear portion of the anchor. Further, a 
longitudinal slot (31) aligned with the opening connects the 

front end of the anchor body to the opening. This slot 
min
imizes the force necessary to pull the anchor into 
its desired position relative to the bone and allows 

the anchor to be disconnected from the object and 
removed after deployment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
fastening devices. More particularly, the invention
relates to devices for attaching portions of objects
within tunnels formed in bones or bone-like structures,
and to methods for the deployment of such devices.The complete or partial detachment of ligaments,
tendons or other soft tissues from their associated
bones within the body are relatively commonplace
injuries, particularly among athletes. Such injuries
are generally the result of excess stress being placed
on these tissues. Tissue detachment may occur as the
result of an accident such as a fall, overexertion
during a work related activity, during the course of an
athletic event or in any one of many other situations
and/or activities.In the case of a partial detachment, commonly
referred to under the general term "sprain", the injury
will frequently heal itself, if given sufficient time,
and if care is taken not to expose the injury to any
undue stress during the healing process. If, however,
the ligament or tendon is completely detached from its
associated bone or bones, or if it is severed as part
of a traumatic injury, partial or permanent disability
may result. Fortunately, a number of surgical
techniques exist for reattaching such detached tissues
and/or completely replacing severly damaged tissues. One such technique involves the reattachment of the
detached tissue using "traditional" attachment devices
such as metal staples, sutures over buttons and
cancellous bone screws. Such "traditional" attachment
devices have also been used to attach tendon or
ligament substitutes (often formed of autogenous tissue
harvested from elsewhere in the body) to the desired
bone or bones.Another technique is described in detail in U.S.
Patent No. 4,950,270 entitled "Cannulated Self-Tapping
Bone Screw", issued to Bowman et al. on August 21,
1990.
In this technique, the anterior cruciate
ligament in a human knee, for example, is replaced
and/or repaired by forming bone tunnels through the
tibia and/or femur at the points of normal attachment
of the anterior cruciate ligament. A ligament graft
with a bone block on at least one of its ends is sized
to fit within the bone tunnels. Suture is then
attached to the outer end of each bone plug and
thereafter passed through the femoral and/or tibial
bone tunnels. The femoral plug and/or the tibial plug
is (are) then inserted into the appropriate bone tunnel
behind the suture. Subsequently, the suture is drawn
tight (simultaneously in opposite directions, in cases
where bone
