<ABSTRACT>
A single-piece flanged ring (10) which can be attached to a thin-walled sheet-metal pipe (18) and is intended for producing a butt connection between two pipe portions (18, 18'), the flanged ring (10) having a single-layer solid profile and being adapted, with one ring leg (12), to the inner side or outer side of the pipe end (20), over the whole length thereof. Strength and sealing can be still further reinforced by a press fit and/or by additional measures such as conicity of the ring leg (12) and anchorage means.

Thin-walled sheet-metal pipe (18) having an integral
flanged ring (10) mounted thereon for making a butt joint

between two pipe sections (18, 18') having an
approximately radially outwardly projecting attachment

flange (14) which carries, at its readially outer end, a
freely ending clamping part (16) bent round conically

towards the sheet-metal pipe (18), and having an annular
limb (12) projecting from the radially internal end of

the attachment flange (14), the flanged ring (10) having
a single-layer solid profile and the external diameter of

the annular limb (12) being matched to the internal
diameter of the sheet-metal pipe (18, 20) or the internal

diameter of the annular limb (12) being matched to the
external diameter of the sheet-metal pipe (18, 20), the

annular limb (12) extending at least partly in a slightly
conical fashion and the external diameter of the free

rim (28) of the annular limb being slightly smaller than
the internal diameter of the sheet-metal pipe (18) or the

internal diameter of the free rim (28) being slightly
larger than the external diameter of the sheet-metal

pipe (18), respectively, characterized in that the
conicity of the annular limb (12) is between 2° and 10°

and, when forced on, brings about a widening or
compression, respectively, of the end (20) of the sheet-metal

pipe (18) and in that the end (20) of the sheet-metal
pipe (18) is held only by close-fitting and airtight

all-round contact with the outside or inside,
respectively, of the annular limb (12) by press-fitting

to the latter.
Sheet-metal pipe having a flanged ring according to
Claim 1, characterized in that the solid profile of the

flanged ring (10) is thick-walled compared with the
sheet-metal thickness of the sheet-metal pipe (18). 
Sheet-metal pipe having a flanged ring according to
Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the annular ring (12)

extends slightly conically at least in a section (12b)
adjacent to the attachment flange (14).
Sheet-metal pipe having a flanged ring according to
one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the

diameter of the annular limb (12) decreases from the
attachment flange (14) towards its free rim (28) and the

external diameter of the free rim (28) is slightly less
than the internal diameter of the sheet-metal pipe (18).
Sheet-metal pipe having a flanged ring according to
one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the diameter

of the annular limb (12) increases from the attachment
flange (14) towards its free end and the internal

diameter of the free rim (28) is slightly larger than the
external diameter of the sheet-metal pipe (18).
Sheet-metal pipe having a flanged ring according to
one of the preceding claims, characterized in that it is

sealed by means of a sealing bead (32) with respect to
the end (20) of the sheet-metal pipe (18).
Sheet-metal pipe having a flanged ring according to
one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the

annular limb (12) has a series, extending in the
circumferential direction, of holes (38) into which the

wall (40) of the sheet-metal pipe (18, 20) can be
pressed.
Sheet-metal pipe having a flanged ring according to
Claim 7, characterized in that the holes (38) have an

elongated shape in the circumferential direction.
Sheet-metal pipe having a flanged ring according to
one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 

sheet-metal pipe (18, 20) is welded to the annular
limb (12).
Sheet-metal pipe having a flanged ring according to
one of the preceding claims, characterized in that

interlocking annular corrugations (34, 36) are pressed
into the annular limb (12) and wall of the sheet-metal

pipe (18, 20).
