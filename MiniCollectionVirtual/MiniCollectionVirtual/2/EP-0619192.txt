<ABSTRACT>
The raised printing part (2) of the printing plate, which is designed to be inked over its entire surface, comprises at least one engraved recessed (sunk) design (4) intended to be filled with the same ink as that used to ink the raised printing part. The raised printing part preferably has a granular structure made up of evenly distributed dots.

<CLAIMS>
A printing plate having at least one relief printing
part (2) comprising a multitude of hollows and intended

to be inked over its entire surface such that all the
hollows are filled with the same ink, characterized in

that the said hollows are etched cuts (4) and form at
least an etched pattern on said relief printing part (2)

such that the pattern gives an image having the appearance
of an intaglio printing projecting from an uniform

background inked in the same color.
The printing plate as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that at least part of the surface (3) of the

relief printing part includes a grainy structure (3a)
composed of evenly distributed screen dots.
The printing plate as claimed in claim 2, characterized
in that the cuts (4) are deeper than the depressions

of the grainy structure (3a).
The printing plate as claimed in claim 3, characterized
in that the depressions of the grainy structure

(3a) have a depth lying between 5 and 30 µm and in that
the cuts (4) of the etched pattern have a depth lying

between 20 and 80 µm.
The printing plate as claimed in one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the height of

the relief printing parts (2) lies between 200 µm and 1000
µm.
The printing plate as claimed in one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the bottom (4a)

of the etched pattern (4) has a line screen. 
The printing plate as claimed in one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that it includes at

least one relief printing part, the surface of which is
furnished with an etched recessed pattern, and a part

of a conventional letterpress plate.
Application of a printing plate as claimed in one of
the preceding claims, with an optically variable ink.
An image obtained by the printing plate as claimed
in claim 1, characterized in that it has a uniform

inking pattern corresponding to the contour of the
printing part and, superimposed on said uniform inking

pattern, a relief pattern, of the same ink and of
the same color, corresponding to the recessed pattern of

the plate, the ink being preferably an ink OVI (optically
variable ink).
Image as claimed in claim 9, characterized in that
the pattern outside the relief pattern has screen

dots.
