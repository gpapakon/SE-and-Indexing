<ABSTRACT>
A variable control process and device for an internal combustion engine valve are disclosed, in particular for the throttle-free power circuit control of a spark ignition engine by means of the lifting function of one or several inlet valves (6) per cylinder. The contours of two camshafts (1, 2) which normally turn at the same speed of rotation are scanned by a scanning arrangement (3) of the adder type and the displacement of the scanning arrangement (3) is transmitted to the valve by the actuating arrangement (4) in order to actuate the valve. The contour of one camshaft (1, 2) which acts as an opening camshaft (1) has a base area and a raised area which merge into each other in a closure area. In order to modify the lifting and/or opening time of the valve (6), the phase position between the camshafts (1, 2) is variable. The scanning arrangement (3) is held in contact with the contour of only one camshaft (2) after the valve (6) is closed, so that the actuating arrangement (4) is held in contact with the valve (6). The contour of the other camshaft (2) moves away from the scanning arrangement (3) after the valve (6) is closed and thus comes once again into contact with the scanning arrangement (3) when the valve (6) begins to open.
