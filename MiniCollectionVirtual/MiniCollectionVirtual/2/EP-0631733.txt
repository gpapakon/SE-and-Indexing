<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel meat improving
agent and a method for improving meat. More precisely, it
relates to a novel meat improving agent to be used for improving
meat, especially tough and stringy parts of meat, so as to
increase the added value of meat and also to a method for
improving meat.Meats of beef, pork, chicken, etc. include low-quality
parts which are too stringy and tough to eat them as they are.
The toughness of meat depends on hard proteins surrounding the
muscular fibrous cortices of meat, especially collagen and
elastin. To soften such tough and stringy meat, mechanical
means for cutting strings of meat or for grinding meat as well
as vegetable-derived proteases such as papain, bromelain,
ficin, etc. have heretofore been employed.However, since these enzymes decompose more muscular
proteins than collagen and elastin having particular
stereo-structures, they have the drawback in that the meat
treated by them loses its elasticity, though being softened, to
have a dry and crumbly taste or have a melt-like pasty taste 
while losing the original taste of meat.Of proteases, elastase is highly specific to collagen and
elastin and is therefore effective in improving the taste of
tough meat (refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.
3-224465). However, since the amounts of collagen and elastin
in meat are not constant but vary, the quality of meat treated
with elastase was not always constant but varied and, as the
case may be, elastase often decomposed muscular proteins to
worsen the taste of the meat treated therewith. Hence,
elastase was defective in this point.On the other hand, transglutaminase (hereinafter referred
to as TG) is an enzyme which catalyzes the transacylation of
the Î³-carboxyamido group in the glutamine residue in peptide
chains (refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.
64-27471). Studies of producing shaped meats (refer to
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2-79956) and
producing tofu (soybean curd) (refer to Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open No. 2-69155), using this enzyme, have
been made. However, there is no report of disclosing a method
of improving meat using this enzyme. The object of the present invention is to provide a
meat improving agent which softens the low-quality, stringy
and tough parts of meat when added in low amounts while
preventing the meat from losing its elasticity and original
taste and preventing it from having a dry and crumbly taste
or having a pasty taste. The meat improving agent of the
invention may
