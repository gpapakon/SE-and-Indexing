<ABSTRACT>
A blood sampling system having an in-line sampling member is provided. The sampling member is connected at one end to a donor tube (26) and at the other end to a sample tube (34) and donor needle (36). The sampling member may include first fork lever (106), second fork lever (108), and wing (102) for reinforcing a frangible joint of the sampling member or, alternatively, for clamping the sample tube (34) and breaking the frangible joint.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to blood collection
and sampling systems generally. More specifically, the
present invention relates to systems for sampling blood
directly from a donor during the collection process.Of course, it is known to collect and use blood for
a variety of treatments and therapies, e.g.,
transfusions. To effectively use collected blood it is
necessary to test the blood to determine its type and
other characteristics.It is advantageous to sample blood directly from a
donor rather than sample blood that is collected in a
collection bag. An anticoagulant, or other solutions,
are typically added to the blood in the collection bag.
By sampling directly from the donor, undiluted blood,
e.g., blood with no anticoagulant or other constituent,
from the donor can be sampled.A variety of techniques are used for this type of
blood sampling. Such techniques are illustrated in
Figures 1-4.In one technique illustrated in Figure 1, a tube 10
leading from a donor needle 11 to the primary collection
bag (not illustrated) is clamped. Scissors are used to
cut the tube on the collection bag side. The open end
12 of the tube 10 is then directed into a test tube 13
while releasing pressure on the clamp 14 to pour blood
into the open test tube.Another technique, illustrated in Figure 2, utilizes
an in-line intermediate needle 16 that is exposed by
removing an in-line cover section 15 of the tube. An 
evacuated donor sampling tube 17 with a rubber stopper
is connected to the needle 16. The needle 16 pierces the
rubber stopper and blood flows into the sampling tube 17.Figure 3 illustrates another methods of sampling
blood. After the needle 18 is withdrawn from the donor's
arm, the donor needle is used to pierce a rubber stopper
of an evacuated test tube 19. A disadvantage of this
system is that it does not sample blood from the donor
but rather, samples blood, including an anticoagulant,
from the primary collection bag 21.Figure 4 illustrates a still further method that
involves using a Y-shaped branch connector 23 on the
donor line 25 between the donor needle 27 and the primary
collection bag (not shown). The outlet 33 of the Y
connector include a connection system allowing filling
of an evacuated test tube 35 through an adaptor 37.WO-81/02837 discloses a separable integral doner connector for use
with flexible blood collection tubing. The device is positioned in-line
with the blood tubing between a phlebotomy needle and a
collection bag. Separation of the device exposes an internally
mounted needle. The
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device for sampling blood from a blood donor, the device being
in flow communication with a needle [36]
 that is designed to receive blood
from a source, the needle [36]
 being connected to a tube [34] leading to a

blood bag, comprising:

a tubular member [28] having means for allowing flow

communication with a collection tube [26] for collecting a blood sample,

the tubular member [28] having a frangible joint [50]
 for separating the
tubular member into two pieces [30, 32]
 to establish flow communication
between a portion of the tubular member and an outside environment; and
tube clamping means [104, 106, 108, 118, 119] arranged on the

tube in juxtaposition to the frangible joint [50] which are movable between

first and second positions, the tube clamping means having opposite anvil
portions [118, 119]
 for squeezing the tube [34] when arranged in the first

position, and when arranged in the second position the tube clamping
means [104, 106, 108, 118, 119]
 bridges the frangible joint [50] and locks

in that position to support the frangible joint from breaking.
The device of Claim 1, wherein the clamping means [104, 106,
108, 118, 119]
 comprises forked lever arms [106, 108] having inwardly

directed anvil portions [118, 119] in the first position and when the arms

[106, 108] are flipped over in the second position, the arms [106, 108]

span the frangible joint [50] on opposite sides thereof, the forked levers

interengaging to lock in the second position.
The device of Claim 1 or Claim 2 further comprising a finger tab
portion [102]
 arranged on an opposite side of the frangible joint as the
clamping means, when the clamping means is in the first position. 
A medical device for in-line installation with a fluid carrying tube,
comprising:


a tubular member [28] having an axial channel [41]
 therethrough,
and a frangible joint [50]
 provided at a location along the length of the
tubular member [28]
 for separating the tubular member into two pieces
[30, 32]
; and
a clamping/supporting means [104, 106, 108, 118, 119] mounted to

the tubular member [28] and actuatable into a first position to clamp the

tube [34] at a location adjacent the tubular member, and actuatable into a

second position to span the frangible joint [50] and self-lock in the second

position.
The device of any one of Claims 1 to 4, wherein one of the two
pieces [32]
 comprises a luer receiving port [46] arranged adjacent to the

frangible joint [50] for connection to a luer [68]
 to establish flow
communication between the piece of the tubular member having the luer

receiving port and an outside environment.
The device of any one of Claims 1 to 5, wherein the frangible joint
[50]
 comprises a reduced outer diameter of the tubular member.
