<DESCRIPTION>
In nature, the organic constituents of animals,
microorganisms and plants are made up of chiral
molecules, or molecules which exhibit handedness.
Enantiomers are stereoisomers or chiral molecules whose
configurations (arrangements of constituent atoms) are
mirror images of each other; absolute configurations at
chiral centers are determined by a set of rules by which
a priority is assigned to each substituent and are
designated R and S. The physical properties of
enantiomers are identical, except for the direction in
which they rotate the plane of polarized light: one
enantiomer rotates plane-polarized light to the right and
the other enantiomer rotates it to the left. However,
the magnitude of the rotation caused by each is the same.The chemical properties of enantiomers are also
identical, with the exception of their interactions with 
optically active reagents. Optically active reagents
interact with enantiomers at different rates, resulting
in reaction rates which may vary greatly and, in some
cases, at such different rates that reaction with one
enantiomer or isomer does not occur. This is particularly
evident in biological systems, in which stereochemical
specificity is the rule because enzymes (biological
catalysts) and most of the substrates on which
they act are optically active.A mixture which includes equal quantities of both
enantiomers is a racemate (or racemic modification). A
racemate is optically inactive, as a result of the fact
that the rotation of polarized light caused by a molecule
of one isomer is equal to and in the opposite direction
from the rotation caused by a molecule of its enantiomer.
Racemates, not optically active compounds, are the
products of most synthetic procedures. Because of the
identity of most physical characteristics of enantiomers,
they cannot be separated by such commonly used methods as
fractional distillation (because they have identical
boiling points), fractional crystallization (because they
are equally soluble in a solvent, unless it is optically
active) and chromatography (because they are held equally
tightly on a given adsorbent, unless it is optically
active). As a result, resolution of a racemic mixture
into enantiomers is not easily accomplished and can be
costly and time consuming.Recently, there has been growing interest in the
synthesis of chiral compounds because of the growing
demand for complex organic molecules of high optical
purity, such as insect hormones and pheromones,
prostaglandins, antitumor compounds, and other drugs.
