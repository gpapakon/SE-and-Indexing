<ABSTRACT>
A scanning apparatus for linewise reproducing an image on one 
face of a transparent image carrier onto light-sensitive means, 

which comprises support means (10) defining a support surface for 
the image carrier (12), an elongate light source (21b), a rod-like 

aspherical lens (23) disposed between said light source (21b) and 
said support means (10) for focussing said elongate light source 

onto an image carrier located on said support means, the 
characteristics of said lens (23) and its position with respect to 

said support means being such that the illuminating angle (α) of an 
image carrier on said support means (10) is at least 20 angular 

degrees and that light intensity variations over said angle are 
smaller than 15 %, and an imaging lens (26) for forming an image of 

a scanned line (24) of an image on said carrier onto said light-sensitive 
means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to scanning apparatus, in
particular to a scratch-suppressing scanning apparatus.Scanning apparatus for producing an electrical representation
of an image on one face of a transparent image carrier are known.
Such apparatus comprises a light source, a support surface for the
image, which is movable in one direction, optical means for
directing light from the light source onto the image carrier to
illuminate a scan line on the image, and an objective lens for
projecting a scan line of the image on light-sensitive detection
means.A main problem encountered in scanners is caused by scratches
in the transparency, in particular in its rear side to be
projected. The appearance of a scratch results in a white or dark
line in the resulting picture, depending upon whether the
transparency is a negative or a positive. Each facet of a scratch
acts like a prism that refracts light passing through the film. A
ray of light that would normally pass through the film and thus
illuminate the image on the front side of the film is refracted in a
direction deviating from the normal one. Much of the light
refracted by scratches in this manner escapes from the original path
of the scanning apparatus and is not detected by the photosensors in
the case of film scanners. Thus, a streaklike area of the final
picture looks as if it would not have been exposed, which means a
black line disturbing the image the case of a positive transparency.One arrangement for reducing the effect of scratches is
disclosed in US-A-4 395 108 of Eastman Kodak Cy. This document
teaches scratch-suppressing projection apparatus, which includes an
objective lens defining first and second congregate planes and an
integrating bar disposed between a condenser lens behind the
transparency to be scanned, and light-sensitive means, e.g.
photomultipliers. Disadvantages of this apparatus are the limited
light output of the illumination source, viz, a flying spot scanner, 
and the limitation to transparencies of reduced format, such as 135
size.Another useful arrangement for suppressing scratches is
disclosed in US-A-4 868 383 of Eastman Kodak Cy. This document
deals with a linear light source for a film scanner including an
elongated cylindrical integrating cavity having diffusely reflective
walls and an output slit parallel to the longitudinal axis of the
cavity. The diffuse illuminating light is favourable for avoiding
the reproduction of scratches, but it has the disadvantage of a
reduced yield so that the light output is
