<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for controlling, in an electrostatic precipitator unit comprising discharge electrodes and collecting electrodes between which a varying high voltage is maintained, a pulsating direct current supplied to these electrodes. In the method according to the invention the frequency, pulse charge and/or pulse duration of the pulsating direct current are caused to vary such that a plurality of combinations of frequency, charge and duration are obtained. For each of these combinations, the voltage U between discharge electrodes and collecting electrodes is measured, and for each of these combinations, a voltage level Uref is determined, measured or calculated. In a defined time interval, for each of these combinations, either the integral Ik =  INTEGRAL U.(U-Uref).dt is measured and/or calculated during the time interval, or Ai = U.(U-Uref) is measured at a number of points of time, whereupon Ik or linear combinations of Ai are used to select the combination of frequency, charge and duration of the pulsating direct current.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for controlling a pulsating direct current supplied to 
an electrostatic precipitator unit comprising discharge electrodes and collecting electrodes 
between which a varying high voltage is maintained. The frequency, pulse charge and/or pulse 
duration of the pulsating direct current are caused to vary such that a plurality of combinations 
of frequency, charge and duration are obtained. For each of said combinations, the voltage U 
between said discharge electrodes and said collecting electrodes is measured.  
 The method is particularly suitable when the pulsating 
direct current is in the form of a pulse train which 
is synchronised with the frequency of the mains voltage 
and whose pulses are generated by supplying, by means of 
a phase angle controlled rectifier (thyristor), part of 
a half-wave of the mains voltage to the electrodes of the 
precipitator after step-up transformation, whereupon a 
plurality of periods of the mains voltage may pass without 
current being supplied to the electrodes. Subsequently, 
part of a half-wave is again supplied, followed by a plurality 
of periods without current etc. In many contexts, especially in flue gas cleaning, 
electrostatic precipitators are the most suitable dust 
collectors. Their design is robust and they are highly 
reliable. Moreover they are most efficient. Degrees of 
separation above 99.9% are not unusual. Since, when compared 
with fabric filters, their operating costs are low 
and the risk of damage and stoppage owing to functional 
disorders is considerably smaller, they are a natural 
choice in many cases. The requirements of the authorities regarding the 
level of emissions from e.g. plants in which fossil fuels 
are combusted, are directed to the total amount of emissions. 
This means that functional troubles must be taken 
into consideration. When using electrostatic precipitators, 
the most frequent trouble is the cleaning of the 
filter involving rapping, which must be carried out to  
 
permit dust deposited on the collecting electrodes to 
be removed from the filter. In such filter cleaning, 
the emissions temporarily increase very strongly, if no 
specific measures are taken. One possible measure is 
disclosed in EP-162 826. The total consumption of energy in the electrostatic 
precipitators in a large incineration plant may amount to 
several hundred kW. It has therefore become most important 
to reduce this consumption of energy as far as possible. 
This is especially important when dust
