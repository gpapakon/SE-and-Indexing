<ABSTRACT>
A papermakers fabric having a system of flat 
monofilament machine direction yarns 22,23 

(hereinafter MD yarns) interwoven with a system of 
cross machine direction yarns 21a,21b (hereinafter CMD 

yarns). The MD yarns 22,23 have an aspect ratio of 
greater than 3:1. Furthermore the MD yarns are 

vertically stacked with at least paired upper 22 and 
lower 23 MD yarns which weave over and under CMD yarns 

21a,21b in such a manner that when a lower MD yarn 23 
weaves over a CMD yarn 21a an upper MD yarn 22 is 

weaving (or floating) over the lower MD yarn 23. 
This ensures that no knuckles are apparent on the 

upper surface of the fabric. The weave gives rise to 
a warp-fill in the range of 80-125%.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to papermakers fabrics
and in particular to fabrics comprised of flat monofilament
yarns.Papermaking machines generally are comprised of
three sections: forming, pressing, and drying. Papermakers
fabrics are employed to transport a continuous paper sheet
through the papermaking equipment as the paper is being
manufactured. The requirements and desirable characteristics
of papermakers fabrics vary in accordance with the particular
section of the machine where the respective fabrics are
utilized.With the development of synthetic yarns, shaped
monofilament yarns have been employed in the construction of
papermakers fabrics. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,290,209
discloses a fabric woven of flat monofilament warp yarns;
U.S. Patent No. 4,755,420 discloses a non-woven construction
where the papermakers fabric is comprised of spirals made
from flat monofilament yarns.Numerous weaves are known in the art which are
employed to achieve different results. For example, U.S. 
Patent No. 4,438,788 discloses a dryer fabric having three
layers of cross machine direction yarns interwoven with a
system of flat monofilament machine direction yarns such that
floats are created on both the top and bottom surfaces of the
fabric. The floats tend to provide a smooth surface for the
fabric.Permeability is an important criteria in the design
of papermakers fabrics. In particular, with respect to
fabrics made for running at high speeds on modern drying
equipment, it is desirable to provide dryer fabrics with
relatively low permeability.U.S. Patent No. 4,290,209 discloses the use of flat
monofilament warp yarns woven contiguous with each other to
provide a fabric with reduced permeability. However, even
where flat warp yarns are woven contiguous with each other,
additional means, such as stuffer yarns, are required to
reduce the permeability of the fabric. As pointed out in
that patent, it is desirable to avoid the use of fluffy,
bulky stuffer yarns to reduce permeability which make the
fabric susceptible to picking up foreign substances or
retaining water.U.S. Patent No. 4,290,209 and U.S. Patent No.
4,755,420 note practical limitations in the aspect ratio
(cross-sectional width to height ratio) of machine direction
warp yarns defining the structural weave of a fabric. The 
highest practical aspect ratio disclosed in those patents is 3:1, and the
aspect ratio is preferably, less than 2:1.U.S. Patent No. 4,621.663 assigned to the assignee of the
present invention, discloses one attempt to utilise
