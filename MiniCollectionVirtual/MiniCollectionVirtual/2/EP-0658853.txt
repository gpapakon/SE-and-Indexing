<ABSTRACT>
When format information is changed, print area check 
data is generated as per the changed format information 

(S25). If the check data is found not to be printable within 
the print area of the tape defined by the printable width and 

set tape length ("YES" in S27), the changed format information 
is invalidated (S28), and a message indicating what has 

taken place appears on the display (S29). Whenever a 
character or the like is input, the corresponding print check 

data is generated (S33). If the data is found to be printable 
within the print area ("NO" in S35), a print-like image 

of that character is displayed; if the data is found not 

printable ("YES" in S35), a message indicating the unavailability 
of printing is displayed (S38), and the corresponding 

text appears on the display unit (S40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape printing
apparatus for printing desired characters onto a print tape.United States Patent No. 5,066,152 has proposed a
tape printing apparatus including primarily a keyboard, a
display unit, and a print mechanism for printing input text
data of characters such as letters and symbols onto a print
tape (e.g., a tape 18 or 24 mm wide) housed in a tape
cassette as the print medium. The display unit displays the
input text data in a predetermined character size in the same
manner as the display screen of commonly used word processors.
The tape printing apparatus, also provided with
various edit functions, is particularly suitable for creating
tapes that are used as labels of file titles and other
storage case identifications. From EP 0 497 352 A a tape printing apparatus is known
wherein the tape printer displays the inputted characters at
a predetermined character size. The display process
corresponds to the text display operation as is elucidated
below. A layout display control unit produces layout display
data that have lines corresponding in number to the number of
line-feed data and in thickness corresponding to line
character-size data which represent the largest character-size
with respect to a corresponding line. The layout display
data are, however, for merely indicating an image of the
lines displayed on the upper-right side portion in a screen.
The inputted characters are displayed at a fixed character
size regardless of whether the printing size of the inputted
characters is changed. Only after input of the characters is
completed and data of a "STOP" code are inputted, the
judgment process is executed.The present inventors have come up with the idea of
displaying on the display unit the text data input through
the keyboard in print-like images, i.e., exactly as the data
is to be printed on the print tape in accordance with desired
print format information, especially with a desired print
character size and a desired tape length. Operating a print 
key of the apparatus, while the text data from the keyboard
is displayed on the display unit in print-like images, may
cause the width of the tape to be detected and trigger a
check on whether printing of the text data is available on
the tape. Printing of the text data is carried out only if
the printing is found to be available on the tape.The above-described present inventors' motivated
apparatus capable of displaying print-like images allows the
input text data to be verified on the display before printing.
