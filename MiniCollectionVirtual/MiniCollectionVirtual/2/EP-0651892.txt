<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to studio
portrait systems in which a still video image is
captured simultaneously with the exposure of the
portrait subject on a frame of film for rapid
proofing.Studio portrait systems in which the same
scene is captured simultaneously as a still video
image and on a frame of film are well-known in the
art. Such systems permit the customer to rapidly
proof all of the frames without having to wait for
the film to be developed and printed. References of
interest in this field include U.S. Patent No.
4,805,037 to Noble et al. and assigned to the
present assignee, U.S. Patent No. 4,716,470 to
Levine, U.S. Patent No. 4,714,962 to Levine, U.S.
Patent No. 4,738,526 to Larish and assigned to
AutoStudio Corporation, European Patent Application
No. 0,196,009 to Ishii and assigned to Casio
Computer Co., Ltd. and Japanese Patent Application
No. JP/63-261,241 assigned to Fuji Photo Film Co.,
Ltd.One problem with such systems is that rapid
proofing ultimately requires that some correlation
be maintained between the still video frame number
and the corresponding frame number on the film.
Also, the customer's responses upon the rapid video
proofing of each still video frame immediately after
the photo session need also to be recorded, 
correlating the response for each frame with the still
video frame number and, ultimately, with the film frame
number. Customer responses may include the number of
prints and any alterations such as cropping, zooming,
tele, pan, etc.Presently, while it is known to record information
optically along the film edge adjacent each frame, such
a recording technique suffers from the disadvantage that
the information can only be recorded with the exposure
of the film, and therefore is not easily supplemented.
Moreover, such information is not available or
retrievable from the film until after the film has
been developed. Accordingly, such a technique is not
particularly helpful in tracking information that comes
to light following the exposure of the film or finding
such information prior to development of the film. As
one example, such information would include customer
responses following a rapid proofing session of viewing
the still video frames.As a result, in most cases such information is
managed by manually writing it in a notebook, including
the correlation between still video frame numbers and
film frame numbers and the customer comments regarding
each frame. The disadvantage of the latter technique is
that it requires manual labor on the part of the person

A dual still video/film portrait system
including means for splitting an incoming beam (10) into

two beams (12, 14), a film camera portion adapted to
capture an image onto a strip of film (20, 400), a still

video imager portion (32) and means (42, 38) for
simultaneously exposing an image from one of said two

beams onto said film in a frame (400a) and capturing an
image from the other of said two beams on said still

video imager, 
characterized by
:

means (50, 52) including a magnetic head (50)
arranged in such a way that information comprising data

pertaining to said frame is recorded in plural magnetic

tracks mutually parallel to the length of a film
having a virtually transparent magnetic

layer (410) thereon,
said tracks being in registration with said frame.
The dual still video/film portrait system of
claim 1 wherein said simultaneous exposing means (42,

38) includes a processor (38) for transmitting
information comprising a still video signal representing

said film image frame to said recording means (50, 52)
whereby said still video signal is distributed and

recorded among said plural parallel magnetic tracks on
said film.
A photofinishing system for printing images on
photographic paper (220) from a strip of film (122,400)

having a magnetic layer (410) thereon on which information
is recorded, said system comprising processor means (210)

and magnetic head means (206) for communicating information
between said magnetic layer and said processor means,


characterized by:
still video playback means (212) connected to said
processor means, whereby said processor means provides

signals corresponding to information communicated by
said magnetic head means; and
still video monitor means (216) connected to said
still video playback means for displaying information

concerning said photographically exposed image frames,
or for displaying still video image frames captured

contemporaneously with the exposure of respective ones
of said frames on said film strip, wherein

said film strip comprises a plurality of frames
bearing photographically exposed images (400a) therein

and a plurality of magnetic tracks (C0-C3, F00-F29) in
said magnetic layer, being virtually transparent and mutually parallel to the length of

said film and in registration with said frames, said
magnetic head means (206) being adapted to read at least

one of said plurality of magnetic tracks physically
associated with one of said exposed frames.
The photofinishing system of claim 3 further
comprising a film advance mechanism (202,204) and a

print exposure light source (200), both controlled by
said processor means (210) for positioning of the

respective film image frame in the exposure stage and
proper exposure thereof on said photographic paper (220).
A method of use in a dual still video/film
portrait system a film (400) having a virtually

transparent magnetic layer (410) thereon, said method
comprising the following steps:


splitting an incoming beam of image light (10) into
two beams (12,14);
simultaneously exposing an image from one of said
two beams onto said film in a frame (400a) and capturing

an image from the other of said two beams on a still
video imager (32); 
recording on said magnetic layer (410) information
comprising data pertaining to said image frame in a first

group of magnetic tracks (C0-C3) mutually parallel to the
length of said film, the tracks being in registration

with said film frame;
obtaining a still video image signal representing
said film image frame from said still video imager (32);

and
recording said still video image signal in a second
group of magnetic tracks (F00-F29) in registration with

said film frame.
