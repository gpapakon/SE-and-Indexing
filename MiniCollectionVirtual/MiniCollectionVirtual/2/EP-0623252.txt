<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to battery chargers and,
more particularly, discloses a method and an apparatus for
rapidly charging a battery, rapidly charging a frozen battery,
rapidly formatting a battery, determining the state of formation
of a battery, and determining the state of the charge of a battery.The general technique of recharging a battery is well
known: forcing a current into the battery. However, this
technique, while simple, can cause excessive heating of the
battery, excessive gassing, and require a prolonged time to fully
recharge the battery. The time required to recharge a battery can
be reduced by applying a depolarizing (discharging) pulse
between charging pulses, as is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
3,597,673 to Burkett et al. A further reduction in the charging
time and in the heating of the battery can be obtained by waiting
for a specified period after the end of the discharge pulse before
applying the next charging pulse. This technique is disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 4,829,225 to Podrazhansky et al. US-4829225 discloses a method of, and apparatus for, charging
a battery by providing: a charge pulse
followed immediately by a depolarization
pulse followed by a stabilization period.However, it is
desirable to further reduce the battery heating and the charging
time.US-4746852 discloses a method of, and
apparatus for, charging a battery by
providing: a charge pulse followed by
a wait period, a discharge pulse and
a further wait period.WO 91/07000 discloses a method of, and
apparatus for discharging a battery in which
voltage spikes are applied both to
charging and discharging pulses. A rechargeable battery, once discharged, requires
recharging to restore energy to the battery. Several hours, or
more, are typically required to recharge a battery because a
conventional battery charger cannot deliver a high charging
current without causing overheating of the battery. As is well
known, overheating a battery dramatically reduces the life of the
battery. Therefore, there is a need for a battery charger which
can quickly recharge a battery by providing a high charging
current in a manner which does not overheat the battery.When a battery is charged, internal resistance is
created within the battery by the creation of a diffusion layer
which results from the migration of positive ions to the negative
plate and the migration of negative ions to the positive plate. This
diffusion layer, sometimes called a Duffney layer, is not easy to
break and creates a higher internal resistance to the
