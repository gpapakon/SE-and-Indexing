<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pump apparatus for
pumping molten metal from a furnace to a place where it is
to be used, said pump apparatus comprising a pump of gas-plunger
type having a container holding a chamber with
an inlet for drawing molten metal from the furnace to the
chamber via a suction pipe immersed in the furnace melt,
and with an outlet for forcing molten metal out of the
chamber to the place of use; a gas-operated suction and
pressure system comprising a suction source with a vacuum
pump, a pressure source with a compressor and a conduit
provided with valve means for alternately connecting and
disconnecting the suction and pressure sources, the gas
pressure of the latter acting directly on the melt in the
chamber inside the container; and a control system for
controlling the pump apparatus, said container being
vertically aligned and arranged immediately above and in
line with the furnace, said outlet being arranged at the
bottom of the container.It is known through patent specifications EP-190 680,
US-4,010,876, DE-1 197 591, GB-1 596 826, US-4,708,191,
FR-2 061 708, DE-3 923 079 and JP-1 095 856, for
instance, to keep components that are in contact with the
melt heated, to protect the melt with an inert gas, to
measure the level of the melt inductively or
capacitively, and to use graphite or ceramic material for
certain components that are in contact with the melt.Each of the known pump apparatus is limited to its own
specific casting process and, if they are of the
pressure-increasing type the mechanical designs are so
complex that they reduce operating reliability and
service life. The object of the present invention is to achieve an
improved pump apparatus that is relatively simple in
design, reliable in operation, pressure-increasing, has
long service life and can be used for all usual casting
methods and metals.The pump apparatus proposed according to the invention is
substantially characterized in that the inlet of the
container is arranged at the bottom thereof; that further valve
means are arranged inside the container to alternately
open and close said inlet and outlet; that the suction
and pressure system comprises a closed circuit containing
a vacuum tank, a pressure tank, a vacuum pump/compressor
unit connected therebetween, and said valve means, and is
connected to the chamber in the container via said
conduit; and that said control system is arranged to
alternately connect and disconnect the vacuum tank and
pressure tank and to synchronously or substantially
synchrono

A pump apparatus for pumping molten metal from a
furnace (5) to a place where it is to be used (46),

comprising a pump (1) of gas-plunger type having a
container holding a chamber (18) with an inlet (47) for

drawing molten metal from the furnace (5) to the chamber
(18) via a suction pipe (2) immersed in the furnace melt,

the chamber (18) to the place of use (46); a gas-operated

suction and pressure system (40) comprising a suction
source with a vacuum pump, a pressure source with a

compressor and a conduit (50) provided with valve means
(44) for alternately connecting and disconnecting the

suction and pressure sources, the gas pressure of the
latter acting directly on the melt in the chamber (18)

inside the container; and a control system (19) for
controlling the pump apparatus, said container being

vertically aligned and arranged immediately above and in
line with the furnace (5), said outlet (48) being

arranged at the bottom (9) of the container,

characterized in that the inlet (47) of the container is
arranged at the bottom (9) thereof; that further valve means (13)

are arranged inside the container to alternately open and
close said inlet (47) and outlet (48); that the suction

and pressure system (40) comprises a closed circuit (49)
containing a vacuum tank (42), a pressure tank (43), a

vacuum pump/compressor unit (41) connected therebetween,
and said valve means (44), and is connected to the

chamber (18) in the container via said conduit (50); and
that said control system (19) is arranged to alternately

connect and disconnect the vacuum tank (42) and pressure

A pump apparatus as claimed in claim 1,

characterized in that a heat accumulator (45) is arranged
in the conduit (50) connecting said circuit (49) to the

chamber (18) in the container, in order to store thermal
