<ABSTRACT>
A method of establishing or re-establishing a digital time-division duplex radio communication link between one of a plurality of portable units and one or more base units forming a cordless telephone system. The invention is concerned particularly with the potential interference created by the use of an unsynchronised call-up transmission in the presence of synchronised signals being exchanged by the rest of the system. The method of the invention involves pre-synchronising the call-up transmission with the rest of the system so that switchovers between transmission bursts and reception windows occur at the same time as between the call-up signal and the rest of the system. This is achieved by deriving synchronisation information from a synchronisation signal which may, for example, be an existing signal on the system containing synchronisation information (i.e. an existing call on the system) or may be a beacon signal which, in some systems, is transmitted by the fixed units for the purpose of range indication. The method is particularly applicable to the MUX1/MUX2/MUX3 format of signals used in the CT2 common air interface protocol.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to duplex
communications systems, and to a method of
establishing a digital time-division duplex radio
communication link between one of a plurality of
portable units and one or more base units forming a
cordless telephone system. The invention is directed
particularly at the interference problem created by
the use of an unsynchronised transmission in the
presence of synchronised systems.Such a system is shown, in its simplest form,
in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings to which
reference will now be made. The system illustrated
comprises a fixed part in the form of a base unit 1,
and two portable parts in the form of respective
handsets 2,3. Each handset comprises an earpiece,
microphone and keypad, this latter being shown
diagrammatically under reference 4. In addition,
each handset contains a respective radio transmitter/
receiver (transceiver) and associated aerial 6,7 by
which the handsets may communicate with the base unit
by radio, as represented by the dotted lines 8,9.
The base unit likewise contains a number of
transceivers at least equal to the number of handsets,
together with an aerial 5 for transmission and
reception of radio signals from the handsets. The
handsets may communicate with each other, but only via
the base unit. The base unit also includes a hardwired
connection 10 to the external telephone system,
and contains interface circuitry for interfacing the
base unit transceiver to the external telephone line.
Although only two handsets are shown, this is to be
taken as an example of the simplest system and many
more handsets, up to the capacity of the system, may 
be provided.The present invention is concerned with
systems of the type illustrated in Figure 1, in which
the speech and other information to be transmitted
between the base unit and the handsets is digitally
encoded before transmission, is transmitted as a
digital signal, and is decoded after reception to
reproduce the original. A limited number of radio
channels are allocated for the radio links 8,9 and it
is clearly therefore preferable to utilise the same
channel for both ends of a radio link - i.e. duplex
communication. Each transceiver in the system will
be able to transmit and receive on a number of these
channels, if not all.In digital second generation (CT2) cordless
telephone systems, burst mode duplex is used to
provide full duplex speech on a single channel. This
essentially means that each transmitter has to
compress the encoded speech from a particular time
interval (called

<CLAIMS>
A method of establishing or re-establishing a digital time-division
duplex radio communication link between one of a plurality of

portable units (2,3) and one or more base units (1) forming a cordless
telephone system, said method comprising sending a call-up signal from

one of the portable units (2,3) to the base unit or units (1), or vice versa, in
order to establish or re-establish a two-way radio link between said one

portable unit and one of the base units, said method being characterised in
that, prior to sending out such a call-up signal, the unit (2,3) which is to

send the call-up signal deduces the synchronism of the system, and
adjusts the timing of the call-up signal so as to make it effectively

synchronous with the system.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the unit (2,3) which is
to send the call-up signal is set to receive a synchronisation signal, which

signal acts to synchronise the call-up signal to the rest of the system.
A method as claimed in claim 2 wherein, upon receiving said
synchronisation signal, the unit (2,3) which is to send the call-up signal sets

the phase of its call-up signal to coincide with that of the system.
A method as claimed in claim 3 wherein said synchronisation
signal is derived from an existing signal which is being transmitted within

the system.
A method as claimed in claim 4 wherein said existing signal is
derived from an existing call elsewhere on the system.
A method as claimed in claim 3 wherein said synchronisation
signal takes the form of an agreed off-air synchronisation signal.
A method as claimed in claim 6 wherein said off-air
synchronisation signal is a standard time and frequency reference signal.
A method as claimed in claim 3 wherein said synchronisation
signal is derived from a system beacon signal which is transmitted

continuously by one or more of the units (2,3) belonging to the system. 
A method as claimed in claim 8 wherein said system beacon
signal is transmitted by one or more of the base units (1) in the system.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims
wherein communication between the portable units (2,3) and base units (1)

within the system takes place by means of bursts of transmission and
reception windows, occurring alternately, with a short time period

(11,12,13), referred to as the guard band, between the end of transmission
(14) and the start of reception (15), and between the end of reception and

the start of the next transmission, and wherein the call-up signal comprises
a call-up transmission burst alternating with a reception window with a

guard band in between, the method being operable to adjust the timing of
the call-up signal such that each of its guard bands coincides in time with a

system guard band.
A duplex communications system incorporating apparatus for
carrying out the method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, said

apparatus comprising means for sending said call-up signal from said one
of the portable units (2,3) to said base unit or units (1), or vice versa, in

order to establish or re-establish the two-way radio link between said one
portable unit and one of the base units, and wherein the unit (2,3) which is

to send the call-up signal includes means for deducing the synchronism of
the system prior to sending out the call-up signal, and adjusting the timing

of the call-up signal so as to make it effectively synchronous with the
system.
