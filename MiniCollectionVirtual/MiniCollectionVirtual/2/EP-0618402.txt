<ABSTRACT>
In a housing (1), which has a substantially U-shaped cross-section, in particular in the form of a so-called striplight, there is fixed a ballast device (3) or a transformer for gas-discharge lamps by means of a U-shaped resiliently elastic bracket (10) which is fitted from the top onto the sheet-metal packet (4) or a casing (cladding, jacket), assigned to said sheet-metal packet, of the ballast device (3) or transformer resting on the bottom of the housing (1). The bracket (2) has at least one transversely running edge, by means of which it is supported under prestress with respect to the sheet-metal packet (4) or its assigned casing.
