<ABSTRACT>
An equalizing circuit (14) is connected between a 
pair of bit lines (BL, 
BL
). The equalizing circuit (14) 
is made up of three MOS transistors (11, 12, 13), and an 

equalization control signal (EQL) is supplied to the 
gates of the MOS transistors (11, 12, 13). A sense 

amplifier circuit (15) is connected to the bit lines 
(BL, 
BL
). The sense amplifier circuit (15) amplifies 
the potential difference occurring between the bit lines 

(BL, 
BL
), for the detection of data. The equalization 
control signal (EQL) is output from a level conversion 

circuit (16). An internal boosted voltage-generating 
circuit (17) constantly generates a boosted voltage 

(Vint) which is higher than an externally-applied power 
supply voltage (Vcc) applied to a power supply terminal 

(10). The boosted voltage (Vint) is applied to the 
level conversion circuit (16). The level conversion 

circuit (16) converts an input control signal (EQL'), 
whose high-level voltage is equal to, or lower than the 

externally-applied power supply voltage (Vcc), into the 
boosted voltage (Vint), thereby generating the equalization 

control signal (EQL).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
memory device comprising a bit line-equalizing circuit
which charges a pair of bit lines to predetermined
potential levels and equalizes the potentials of the bit
lines to each other before data is read out from a memory
cell. In particular, it relates to a semiconductor
memory device comprising:
first and second bit lines;a boosted voltage generating circuit (17) for
generating a boosted voltage (Vint) having a voltage
level higher than a voltage level of a power supply
voltage (Vcc) supplied to an input thereof; anda charging/equalizing circuit responsive to a
charging/equalizing control signal for charging said
first and second bit lines with a charging voltage and
for equalizing said first and second bit lines;at the
same equalized voltage level. Such a semiconductor
memory device is disclosed in
GB-A-2 118 795. However, this reference does not
disclose how the boosted voltage is generated.EP-A-0 092 809 discloses a circuit for selectively
switching a boosted voltage which is generated constantly
in a boosted voltage generating circuit in order to solve
the problem of delay of the boosted voltage. This
reference, however, does not disclose or suggest any
technical idea of using a boosted voltage which is 
constantly generated to be fed to a charging/equalizing
control signal.EP-A-0 535 325 discloses a circuit for supplying a
constantly boosted voltage to a word line. This
reference, however, does not disclose the use of a
constantly boosted voltage to be fed to a
charging/equalizing control signal.In a dynamic random access memory (DRAM), an
equalizing operation is performed before data is read
out from a memory cell. The equalizing operation is an
operation for charging a pair of bit lines to predetermined
potential levels and then equalizing the potential
levels to each other. In an ordinary case, the
equalizing operation is performed by means of a bit
line-equalizing circuit made up of N-channel MOS transistors.FIG. 1 is a circuit diagram showing the peripheral
circuit configuration of a bit line-equalizing circuit
employed in a conventional DRAM. (The bit line-equalizing
circuit will be hereinafter referred to
simply as an "equalizing circuit".) Referring to
FIG. 1, an equalizing circuit 14 is made up of three
N-channel MOS transistors 11, 12 and 13 and is connected
between a pair of bit lines BL and BL. A sense amplifier
circuit 15 for detecting data is also connected to the
bit lines.In the equalizing circuit 14, two MOS transistors
