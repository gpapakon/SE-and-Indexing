<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an α-olefin polymerization
catalyst system, a process for producing an α-olefin
polymer using the same, a solid catalyst component
for an α-olefin polymerization, and a process for
preparing the same. More particularly, it relates to a
novel polymerization catalyst system for polymerizing an
α-olefin which has a very high catalytic activity per
solid catalyst and per titanium atom and to a process
for producing a highly stereoregular α-olefin polymer
which contains little catalyst residue and little amorphous
polymer and which has excellent mechanical properties
and excellent processability using the above novel
catalyst system.In the production of a polymer of an α-olefin
such as propylene, or butene-1, it is well-known
to use a Ziegler-Natta catalyst consisting of a
transition metal compound of Group IV to VI of the
Periodic Table and an organometallic compound of Groups
I to III of the Periodic Table.In the production of an α-olefin polymer,
amorphous polymers are produced as by-products in
addition to a highly stereoregular α-olefin polymer
which has a high industrial utilization value. Said
amorphous polymer is low in industrial utilization value 
and adversely affects on the mechanical properties
required in molding the α-olefin polymer into a molded
article, film, fiber, other processings and using the
same. Also, the formation of amorphous polymer brings
about the loss of the starting monomers and requires an
equipment for removing the amorphous polymer. This is
very disadvantageous in industry. Accordingly, the
catalyst system for producing an α-olefin polymer is
required to produce no or little, if any, such amorphous
polymer. Furthermore, in the α-olefin polymer obtained,
there remains a catalyst residue consisting of the
transition metal compound and the organometallic compound.
This catalyst residue causes problems in various
respects such as stability, processability and the like
of the α-olefin polymer, and hence, it becomes necessary
to provide an equipment for removal of the catalyst
residue and stabilization of polymer.The above disadvantage can be overcome by increasing
the catalytic activity represented by the
weight of the α-olefin polymer produced per unit weight
of catalyst, whereby the equipment for removing the
above catalyst residue becomes unnecessary and the cost
for producing the α-olefin polymer can be reduced.It is known that when a Ti-Mg complex type
solid catalyst obtained by reducing a tetravalent
titanium compound with an organomagnesium
