<ABSTRACT>
In a tone burst generator (10) a continuous tone voltage is applied across 
two series-connected semiconductor switches (Q1,Q2) each having an ON state and 

an OFF state. A first control circuit (14) controls the state of the first switch (Q1) 
and the variable impedance in an intermediate region between its ON and OFF states 

to cause gradual, well-defined OFF/ON and ON/OFF transitions of the first switch. 
As a result of these first switch transitions, a voltage tone burst is generated that has 

precisely defined edges to eliminate clicking noise. The continuous tone voltage is 
of only one polarity--it has a non-zero DC component and an AC component having 

a peak-to-peak variation less the twice the magnitude of the non-zero DC 
component. A second control circuit (15) controls the state of the second switch 

(Q2) and the variable impedance in an intermediate region between its ON and OFF 
states to cause well defined ON/OFF and OFF/ON transitions of the second switch. 

The second switch OFF/ON transition reduces the voltage tone burst to have a 
substantially zero AC component.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tone burst generators.In many countries outside the United States, telephone line circuits
frequently include tone burst generators for use with periodic pulse metering (PPM)
telephone lines. The generators transmit tone bursts to telephone station equipment
for use in incrementing call cost meters and in controlling coin collection at public
telephones. It is important to control the tone burst envelope to avoid in-band noise
resulting in audible clicking on the line. Since it is necessary to have one generator
per PPM line, the unit cost of such generators is a very significant factor.In one prior art arrangement, tone bursts are generated by turning an
oscillator filter unit ON and OFF. However, since the oscillator filter units include
inductors, the unit size and cost are negative factors.In a second prior art arrangement, tone bursts are generated using a
four-quadrant linear multiplier circuit. The circuit cost is again too high. In
addition, a reduction in the idle channel noise--the magnitude of the tone which
persists after a tone burst is over--would be desirable.U.S.A. 4,035,583 describes a tone generator including an oscillator
means controlled by shunt resistance in a resonant circuit. The tone generator is
permanently connected across a communication line. The tone generator gradually
increases its amplitude and frequency of signal when a toll pulse is required. At the
end of the toll pulse, the amplitude and frequency of signal are gradually decreased
so that audible clicking associated with the calling telephone is eliminated.According to this invention there is provided a tone burst generator as
claimed in claim 1.In an exemplary tone burst generator where a continuous tone voltage is
applied advantageously across the combination of two series-connected
semiconductor switches each having an ON state and an OFF state, a first control
circuit controls the state of the first switch and, significantly, the variable impedance
in an intermediate region between its ON and OFF states to cause gradual, well-defined
OFF/ON and ON/OFF transitions of the first switch. As a result of these first
switch transitions, a voltage tone burst is generated that has precisely defined edges
to eliminate clicking noise. The tone burst is generated at the interconnection
between the first and second switch means. The OFF/ON and ON/OFF transitions of
the first switch each have a duration greater than three times the period of the
continuous tone voltage. Illustratively, the continuous
