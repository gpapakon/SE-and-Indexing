<ABSTRACT>
Knockdown-elements framework for supporting and stretching 
light signs made from transparent or semitransparent 

flexible materials, constituted by a plurality of 
vertical bars (1) fixed to a wall, a cantilever roof or 

the like, by upper (5) and lower (5a) anchoring flanges 
inclined at 45°, provided at their ends with an upper 

stretching section bar (14) and a lower stretching 
section bar (14a), by a plurality of upper (21), intermediate 

(22) and lower (20) reflective plates, the 
latter being designed to horizontally slide within a 

continuous grooved seat (18a), placed on said lower 
anchoring flanges and vertically on a folded strip (23) 

provided at the base of the intermediate reflective 
plates, the lower stretching section bar (14a) being 

shiftable, integrally with the lower anchoring flanges 
(5a), upwards and/or downwards, in order to allow a 

perfect stretching of the flexible sheet (24) which 
constitutes the display.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a framework composed by knockdown- 
elements, a part of which at least are modular 
elements, for supporting and stretching light signs 
made from flexible materials, of large size, suitable 
for long-distance display and installed on fixed structures, 
such as buildings, fuel distribution stands, and 
the like. As known, the supporting/stretching frameworks for 
light signs in the form of a sheet made from flexible 
materials, such as for instance a vinyl sheet or the 
like, are normally enclosed inside a quadrangular, box-like 
body with large sizes in length and width, and 
with a small depth; the signs are then lighted by 
fluorescent lamps, or another type of lamps, installed 
inside the box-like body, close to light reflective 
surfaces or parabolae. In some cases, the sheet of 
flexible, transparent or semitransparent material is 
taut on a quadrangular framework which has the configuration 
of a frame, rotatably anchored onto the upper 
edge of the framework by means of hinges or other 
hooking means, in order to enable the interior of the 
box-like body to be accessed for assembly, periodical 
cleaning, lamp replacement and maintenance purposes, as 
described, for instance, in US 4817317 and in EP 
0268308. In other types of realizations, the supporting/stretching  
 
structure for the flexible sheet bearing the 
display is provided with supporting section bars, which 
are such as to enable the sheet to be diverted around 
the edge of the same framework and then stretched 
inside the latter, by winding on small metal rods 
capable of being put under tension on the section bars 
which are contained inside the box-like body; in such 
way, the sheet-supporting peripheral frame can be 
omitted. In practice, these types of light signs, namely, both 
those equipped with a peripheral frame, and those in 
which the flexible sheet is taut flush of the openable 
framework, suffer from serious drawbacks, among which 
the poor stiffness of supporting and stretching section 
bars coupling, the poor tightness to the sepage of 
water and dust between the framework and the stretching 
section bars and box-like body, and the difficulty of 
access to the interior of said box-like body. In fact, in the case of frameworks which have the 
configuration of a frame and which are upwards-openable, 
the dap-joint hooking system with rotation of the 
framework requires that in said side a continuous quite 
long open hollow be provided, to allow the rotation of 
the sheet-bearing,
