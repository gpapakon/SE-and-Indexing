<ABSTRACT>
It is fairly difficult to adjust and install prior art environmental spray dispensers to prevent it from spraying the people using the area. A device (1) has been created which moves a pivoted lever (10) clockwise via a precisely adjustable trigger (60) with a roller (61). A release rocker (8) with its cam section (8a) is forced from its position of rest by the pivoted lever (10); the hammer section (2a) of the spring (7) loaded angled rocker (2) strikes the dispenser (50) fitted with a conventional spray pump and thus produces the desired spray. The environmental spray dispenser (1) is made ready by actuating the lever anticlockwise I. Various embodiments of the trigger (60) make it possible to install the spray dispenser in such a way that it produces a delayed spray in virtually all fitting positions, hence with no annoyance to the people in the area.

A room spray dispenser (1) with a trigger mechanism, the room spray dispenser
(1) having arranged therein a dispenser (50-54) with a container for, or with an

odour-neutralising and/or deodorising liquid to be sprayed, and the neck (54) of
the container containing a valve body (51) with a pump and nozzle (52), a

pressure lever (2) being provided which is loaded with at least one spring (7) in
the direction of the valve body (51) and acts thereupon, this pressure lever (2)

having a tensioning and stopping device, characterised in that there is in the
tensioning and stopping device, a vertically arranged rotary axle (6), which ends

in a trigger lever (60) on the upper side and can be turned by this and which axle
is guided through the centre part of a pivoted lever (10) and to which the pivoted

lever (10) is fixed, which lever in a turned-outwards position (I) lifts and tensions
by a latch arm (2c) connected to the pressure lever (2), the rocker-formed

pressure lever (2) and a stopper/release rocker (8) which can be turned out from
the vertical and is hinged to the pressure lever (2), the stopper/release rocker (8)

moving into a safety position (II) in an intermediate position of the pivoted lever
(10) and the pivoted lever (10) in its resting position (III) acts upon the

stopper/release rocker (8) which releases the spring-loaded pressure lever (2),
whereby a hammer part (2a) of the pressure lever (2) can strike the valve body

(51) and trigger the spraying action.
A room spray dispenser according to claim 1, characterised in that the pivoted
lever (10) is formed with three arms, in that on this lever there is a centre part

(10b) with a releasing cam (10c) at the end, with which centre part, at both sides
and at right-angles, are associated two rotating cams (10a) and pressure parts

(10d) each.
A room spray dispenser according to claim 1, characterised in that the pressure
lever (2) is an angular rocker with a hammer part (2a), with bearing shells (2b) 

arranged in the outer angle area, on which bearing shells latch arms (2c) with
cams (2d) are arranged.
A room spray dispenser according to claim 3, characterised in that a
stopper/release rocker (8) is arranged movably in bearings on the pressure lever

(2) which rocker has a cam part (8a) with a recess (8c).
A room spray dispenser according to claim 4, characterised in that the
stopper/release rocker (8) can be supported on a support roller (11) and together

with the latter engages in the recess (8c).
A room spray dispenser according to claim 4, characterised in that a pull-back
spring (28) acts upon the stopper/release rocker (8), which spring pulls the

stopper/release rocker (8) against a supporting roller (11) and against a stop
cam (26) on the pressure lever (2).
A room spray dispenser according to claim 3, characterised in that a pull-back
rocker (9) is arranged movably in bearings on an axle (3) which rests with its

cams (9a) on at least one rotating cam (10a) in each case and by means of a
retaining spring (19) presses against this rotating cam (10a).
A room spray dispenser according to claim 1, characterised in that the rotating
axle (6) has a polygonal cross-section.
A room spray dispenser according to claims 1 and 8, characterised in that a
trigger lever (60) is arranged at one end of the rotating axle (6) and in that this

lever on its end opposite to the axle (6) has a trigger roller (61, 61') arranged
rotatably in bearings.
A room spray dispenser according to claim 9, characterised in that the axle (6) is
inserted, interlocking in the centre of a worm wheel (66) and in that a screw (67) 

is fixed in the trigger lever (60) on an axle (68) manually rotatable from outside,
which screw engages into the worm wheel (66).
A room spray dispenser according to claim 9, characterised in that the trigger
lever (60) is formed in two parts (60', 60'').
A room spray dispenser according to claim 1, characterised in that a trigger lever
(71) is provided for installation in a door aperture, which lever has at least

partially a flat area (71') of a low construction height.
A room spray dispenser according to claim 9, characterised in that a trigger
lever (60) is formed so as to be crankable and in that the selected angle of the

trigger lever (60) is determined by housing parts (60', 60'') interlocking together.
Application of a room spray dispenser according to claim 1 for installation on a
door leaf (72) or in the area (75) of a door.
Application of a room spray dispenser according to claim 14 in toilets and/or
wash-rooms.
