<ABSTRACT>
An integrated optical system (10) illuminates an 
ultraviolet spatial detector (12) with an image (24) 

from a field of interest. The ultraviolet spatial 
detector (12) is comprised of an electron multiplying 

microchannel plate (39) and a 100 pixel discrete anode 
array (40) using a high strip current microchannel 

plate. The discrete anode array (40) preserves the 
spatial distribution of the image (12). The 

ultraviolet spatial sensor (12) has a wide field of 
view. The ultraviolet spatial detector (12) has a 

photon counting sensor (18) capable of detecting 
ultraviolet sources to determine their position to 

within plus or minus 4.5 degrees.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an ultraviolet spatial
sensor and more particularly to a wide-field-of-view
photon counting sensor using a microchannel plate and
a discrete anode array.Prior art devices based on charge centroiding
techniques such as the resistive anode and wedge strip
anode, provide good resolution but suffer from
coincidence losses. During periods of intense
radiation they generate spurious signals spatially
located between two actual photo events. This occurs
when their centroiding electronics cannot temporarily
resolve multiple photo events. These losses manifest
themselves in either false targets or loss of signal
and therefore lead to false target detections or
decreasing sensitivity of the detector. This behavior
may undermine the performance of an application
utilizing this type of sensor. The present invention
seeks to avoid this behavior since centroiding of
individual photo events is not necessary.United States Patent 4,395,636 to Hal O. Anger, et
al., entitled "Radiation Imaging Apparatus," describes
a radiation imaging system using a charge multiplier
and a position sensitive anode for detecting the
centroid position of a charge cloud. The apparatus has
two dimensional position coordinate readout capability.
The apparatus images incident photons, ions, electrons,
or nuclear particles, and has a high inherent spatial
and linear resolution. The apparatus disclosed
includes systems which use the fast response of
microchannel plates, position sensitive repetitive
strip and wedge region anodes, and preamps to perform
scintillation pulse height analysis digitally.United States Patent 4,845,552 to Bruno Jaggi, et 
al., entitled "Quantitative Light Microscope Using a
Solid State Detector in the Primary Image Plane,"
describes a solid state microscope apparatus for
viewing and scanning microscopic objects. The
microscope comprises a light source with a condenser
and diffusion filter. The image is projected directly,
through one high resolution lens (an objective), onto
a large two-dimensional CCD-array or similar solid
state image sensor located in the intermediate plane of
the objective lens. The sensed discrete image is
digitized, conditioned and processed in real time and
displayed on a high resolution monitor.United States Patent 4,872,051 to Robert H. Dye,
entitled "Collision Avoidance Alarm System," describes
an apparatus for detecting the presence of any object
on a collision course with a platform or vehicle
carrying the apparatus and for generating an alarm upon
such detection. A
