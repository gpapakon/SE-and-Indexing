<ABSTRACT>
An integrated scanner for scanning a barcode is formed on a 
common substrate. The scanner may include a micro-machined 

mirror, a laser diode, and a detector, mounted on a single 
substrate or several connected substrates. Lenses can be used to 

focus a laser beam from the laser diode as well as expand a laser 
beam deflected by the micro-machined mirror. The scanner may also 

scan a barcode without using a micro-machined mirror by rotating 
the laser diode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to scanners. More
specifically, the present invention relates to integrated barcode
scanners mounted on common substrates.Barcodes store information about an associated object and are
read by scanners, which are now handheld. As barcode scanners
have become smaller, the number of uses have increased. Today,
barcode scanners are used to price store items, control warehouse
inventory, and even route overnight packages.In reading a barcode, a barcode scanner scans a laser beam
across the barcode and detects the reflected light from the
barcode. Typically, barcode scanners, including handheld
scanners, have been constructed using discrete components. These
discrete components, such as laser diodes and rotatable scanning
mirrors, are separately manufactured and carefully aligned in the
scanner to obtain the proper scanning function.However, the use of discrete components limits further
miniaturization of the barcode scanner, thus restricting
additional uses for the barcode scanner. Further, improper
alignment of the discrete components can render the scanner
inoperative. Thus, the discrete components must be carefully
aligned during assembly, making the scanner complex and costly to
construct. EP-A-0 669 592 forms part of the prior art under
Art. 54 (3) EPC and relates to an optical device for code
reader. A light emitting element, a prism and a light
receiving element are all fixed to a semiconductor
substrate.US-A-5 097 354 relates to a beam scanner comprising
a light-emitting element, a lens disposed forwardly of
the light-emitting element in such a manner that its
optical axis is parallel to the optical axis of the
light-emitting element, and a rocking reflective mirror
which is rotated by Coulomb force acting between static
electrodes. There also is provided a beam scanner
comprising a light-emitting element, a lens disposed
forwardly of the light-emitting element in such a manner
that its optical axis is parallel to the optical axis of
the light-emitting element, and a displacement mechanism
for reciprocal displacement of either the light-emitting
element or the lens in a direction generally perpendicular
to the optical axis thereof.US-A-5 136 147 discloses a portable scanning head
which emits and receives light from a light emitting
diode to read symbols, such as bar-code symbols. The
optics within the scanner are operative for focusing a
light beam and the view of a light sensor in different
planes exteriorly of a scanner housing. Imaging means are
provided in the unit
