<ABSTRACT>
Non-specific therapeutic vaccine complex, acting by immunomodulation, providing for the regulation of the natural defences of the organism. Said medicament insures, inter alia, the negativation of the AIDS P24 antigens. It is substantially comprised of RNA, selective membrane moieties of microbial germs, particular sequences of amino acids, sodium chloride and steroid anti-inflammatory, in predetermined proportions. The medicament according to the invention is particularly intended for the treatment of acquired immunodeficiency diseases.

<CLAIMS>
Anti-AIDS immunomodulator complex constituted by a mixture of selected
bacterial ribonucleic acids, selected bacterial membrane fractions - glycopeptides and

lipopolysaccharides - and amino acids of type III collagen.
The immunomodulator complex according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 it
comprises dual molecules constituted by the coupling of a functional amino acid arm

ensuring bonding to a target, with an RNA genetic arm corresponding to the coded
description of the functional arm composition.
The immunomodulator complex according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterized by
 the
production of antibodies directed against the bonding site of the virus, on the CD4 molecule

in particular, and the production of endogenous interferon.
The immunomodulator complex according to claims 1 to 3, inducing, on
seropositive patients, an anti-idiotypic vaccination against idiotypes of the anti-HIV

antibodies, having for its effect negativing the antigenemy P24.
The immunomodulator complex according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized by

a dosage form such that it can be administrated by different routes: perfusions, intravenous
injections, subcutaneously, transdermal devices or the like, further comprising sodium

chloride.
The immunomodulator complex according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized by

a dosage form such that it can be administrated simultaneously with major antiinflammatories,
cortical type, with immunosuppressive effects, to inhibit or diminish the anti-CD4

auto-immune reaction, which contributes to CD4 lymphopeny.
