<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fasteners and 
specifically to fasteners of the type having two opposed 
fastener members each including a surface having a 
plurality of arranged headed stems projecting therefrom. Mating fasteners that include two opposed 
fastener members are popular in a variety of applications. 
The particular type of mating fastener with which the 
present invention is concerned includes two opposed 
fastener members, each including a surface having a 
plurality of arranged headed stems projecting therefrom. 
Such fasteners are particularly useful in an environment 
where it is desirable to interengage the fastener using a 
relatively small amount of force, while requiring a larger 
force to separate the fastener members. A conventional molded polymeric fastener is 
shown in Figure 1. Included are opposed fastener members 
10 and 12, including bases 14 and 16, respectively. Each 
base includes a plurality of arranged stems 18 
orthogonally projecting therefrom, and each terminating in 
a head 20 at the respective distal ends of stems 18. The 
heads have generally arcuate surfaces 22 opposite the 
respective bases 14 and 16, which surfaces are adapted for 
sliding contact with the encountered arcuate surfaces 22 
of heads 20 when the fastener members are first brought 
together. Heads 20 also each include a generally planar 
latching surface 24 extending radially outwardly of the 
stem, which is adapted to engage a latching surface of an 
opposed head, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 1 shows fastener members 10 and 12 
prepared for engagement, with the heads of one fastener 
member positioned generally between the heads of the other 
fastener member. To engage the fastener, fastener members 
10 and 12 are urged toward each other with the respective  
 
bases generally parallel, causing heads 20 to contact and 
to deflect the attached stems laterally. The lateral 
deflection of the stems allows the heads of one fastener 
member to pass the heads of the opposed fastener member to 
engage the fastener members in the manner illustrated in 
Figure 2. In the past, fasteners of the type discussed 
above were generally formed by passing a backing layer 
having a multiplicity of projecting stems beneath a heat 
source, which heat source tends to melt the stems to form 
heads atop each of the stems. Such a process is known in 
the art, as illustrated by US-A-4,290,832. 
This publication discloses a multi-step process for producing a 
fastener member having a backing layer, a plurality of 
monofilament

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a fastener member 
comprising a base (114) and a plurality of arranged stems 

(118) each having a proximal end projecting from the base 
and a distal end having a head (120), the method 

comprising the steps of: 

(a) providing a permanent base mold (102) having 
a cavity (109) adapted to mold the base of the fastener; 
(b) providing a sacrificial stem mold (100) 
having a plurality of arranged passageways (106) for 

molding the stems; 
(c) providing a permanent head mold (104) having 
a plurality of arranged cavities for molding the heads; 
(d) securing the sacrificial stem mold adjacent

fluidic communication with the base mold cavity, and 
securing the head mold adjacent the sacrificial stem mold 

with the head mold cavities in fluidic communication with 
the passageways of the sacrificial stem mold; 
(e) flowing a molten plastic into the molds 
through an inlet passageway (108) in one of the base mold, 

the sacrificial stem mold, and the head mold to form the 
base, stems, and heads of the fastener member; 
(f) solidifying the plastic within the molds to 
form the fastener member; 
(g) separating the head mold and the base mold 
from the sacrificial stem mold and the solidified fastener 

member; and 
(h) removing the sacrificial mold to release the 
fastener member from the sacrificial mold without damage 

to the fastener member. 
The method of claim 1, wherein step (h) 
includes removing the sacrificial mold by dissolving the 

mold with a solvent.  
 
The method of claim 1, wherein step (h) includes removing 
the sacrificial mold by providing a heated solvent 

and dissolving the mold with the heated solvent. 
The method of claim 2 or 3, wherein the solvent comprises 
water. 
The method of claim 2, wherein step (h) includes removing 
the sacrificial mold by dissolving the mold with 

a solvent and agitating the mold.
