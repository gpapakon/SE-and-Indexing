<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus uses a contact-type charger (20) to 
charge a photoreceptor (10). The D.C. current supplied to the 

charger is measured while the output value of the A.C. voltage 
is changed within a predetermined range, and the output value 

of the A.C. voltage is set in accordance with the measurement 
result. 

In an alternative embodiment, the voltage of the photoreceptor is 
measured by a voltmeter and this value is used for setting the AC. 

voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a charging member which 
is incorporated in an image forming apparatus such as an 
electrophotographic copying machine and an electrostatic 
recording apparatus and electrifies an image forming object, 
and more preferably to a charging unit of a magnetic brush 
type. Heretofore, a corona charging unit has generally been 
used for charging of an image forming object such as a 
photoreceptor drum in an image forming apparatus of an 
electrophotographic type. In the corona charging unit, high 
voltage is impressed on a corona wire to generate an intensive 
electric field around the corona wire for gas discharge, and 
charged ions generated on that occasion are adsorbed on the 
image forming object which is thus charged. The conventional corona charging unit used in an 
electrophotographic image forming apparatus as those mentioned 
above does not come into contact with an image forming object  
 
mechanically for charging, and therefore, it has an advantage 
that it does not hurt the image forming object when charging. 
However, it has disadvantages that there are risks of an 
electric shock and a leak, while ozone caused by gas discharge 
is harmful for the human body and it shortens a life of an 
image forming object. Further, charging voltage by means of a 
corona charging unit is intensely affected by temperature and 
humidity and therefore is unstable, noise is further produced 
by high voltage in the corona charging unit, and a period of 
time of 5 seconds or more is needed for obtaining stable 
charging voltage after inputting high voltage, which are 
serious disadvantages when an electrophotographic image 
forming apparatus is utilized as a communication terminal and 
an information processing apparatus. Main cause for the various disadvantages of the corona 
charging unit mentioned above lies in that charging is carried 
out mainly through gas discharge. Accordingly, as a charging unit capable of charging the 
image forming object without requiring high voltage gas 
discharge as in a corona charging unit and without hurting the 
image forming object mechanically, Japanese Patent Publication 
Open to Public Inspection No. 133569/1984 (hereinafter 
referred to as Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication) discloses a 
charging unit wherein magnetic particles are adsorbed on a 
cylindrical magnetic-particle-carrier housing therein magnets 
for forming a magnetic brush thereon and the magnetic brush  
 
rubs the surface of an image forming object for charging while
