<ABSTRACT>
In the process for the preparation of a melt for the production of mineral fibres, the raw material (6) to be melted is introduced in the form of a pile of loose material so that it forms an inclined pile surface (7). In order to form a melt zone, at least part of the pile surface (7) is subjected to the melting temperature in at least one combustion chamber (8). The melt flowing out in the region of the pile surface (7), forming a melt surface crust (7a), is collected in a collection chamber (11) on the base of the combustion chamber (8) and transported out to the outside for further processing. In order to provide a process by means of which the melt output can be significantly increased, it is proposed that the melt surface crust (7a) of the pile surface (7) is broken up in at least one region from the inside outward.
