<CLAIMS>
Charging apparatus having switchable connections 
for recharging batteries and having a controller for 

monitoring the charge state of the batteries, the batteries 
to be charged being connectable to at least two 

sensors (2, 4) in order to detect their parameters, in 
that the controller (5) weights the measurements of the 

sensors (2, 4) of a battery with a priority factor, then 
compares them with predetermined limit values of this 

battery, and interrupts the charging process of this 
battery if the values exceed or fall below the predetermined 

limit value, characterised in that a plurality of 
battery compartments can be provided for holding batteries 

and in that the charging apparatus has a switch 
with which a parameter for defining the priority (F) can 

be selected. 
Charging apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the charging apparatus supplies the 

batteries in the battery compartments (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 
1.n) in parallel, in that the controller (5) sequentially 

interrogates the individual battery parameters and 
disconnects the relevant battery if the values exceed or 

fall below the predetermined limit values. 
Charging apparatus according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the controller 

(5) disconnects the charge voltage in the event of a 
battery compartment (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.n) not being 

occupied. 
Charging apparatus according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the sensors (2,  

 
4) detect the battery voltage (U) and/or the battery 

temperature (T) as parameters. 
Charging apparatus according to Claim 4, characterised 
in that the controller 5 commences the charging 

process with the coldest battery. 
Charging apparatus according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in that the controller 5 commences the 

charging process with the battery which has the lowest 
voltage. 
Charging apparatus according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the charging 

apparatus is a rapid charging apparatus, the charging 
time for one battery being in the mi
nutes range. 
Charging apparatus according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the charging 

apparatus is constructed as a pocket apparatus and is 
portable. 
Charging apparatus according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the charging 

apparatus has separate displays for the detected parameters 
for each battery compartment (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.n). 
Charging apparatus according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the charging 

apparatus can be used for charging NiCd batteries.
