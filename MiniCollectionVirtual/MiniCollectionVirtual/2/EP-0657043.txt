<ABSTRACT>
With respect to man-machine communication (MMC), a numerical control system for machine tools or robots has in the first instance a universal form which can subsequently be tailored in the simplest possible way to any application. Information handling provides control data which can be processed in a universal manner by an integrated control kernal (CK), and thus provides control of the machine and robot drives (ANT), including peripherals (PER).

<CLAIMS>
Numerical control for machine tools or robots, 
where an object-oriented programming takes place in 

that object classes are provided, of which in each case 
a number of objects can be formed, and whereby there is 

a message mechanism for communication with other 
objects, characterized by the following features: 


1.1 a man-machine interface (MMC), a sequence control 
system (A) and object classes, formed in software 

or in software and hardware, for abstract 
processing (B), geometry (G), kinematic (K), 

technology data types (T) etc; 
1.2 a specific object class for abstract control data 
types (S) in connection with an integrated 

numerical control kernel (CK) which can be 
constructed as object class, 
1.3 whereby from each non-specific object class any 
number of objects can be formed, whereby each 

object has its own data range, a procedure part 
(PT) for carrying out either one or more 

processing methods (B1 to Bn), geometry methods 
(G1 to Gn), kinematic methods (K1 to Kn) or 

technology methods (T1 to Tn) etc. and a message 
mechanism for communication with other objects, 
1.4 whereby from the object class of the control data 
types (S) any number of objects (S1 to Sn) can be 

formed which have one or more control data 
generation methods (S1 to Sn), 
1.5 the user information entered by way of the man-machine 
interface (MMC) is interpreted by the 

sequence control system (A) and leads to an 
activation of the respectively selected objects, 
1.6 the activated objects exchange the mutually 
required information by way of their message 

mechanism, whereby the activated objects 
contribute their portion in a state-dependent  

 
manner directly or by means of additional objects 

for control data generation and thereby by way of 
the network-like linking of the objects form a 

runnable function unit for the numerical control, 
1.7 the sequence control system (A) itself is formed 
as object class, the objects of which have methods 

(A1 to An) which allow the state-dependent 
interpretation of an abstract description of the 

operational sequence from the control-internal 
data management. 
Numerical control according to claim 1, 
whereby each object (A,B,G,K,T,S) can be allocated a 

visualization part (VT), upon the activation of which a 
respective object can make visualization demands of the 

operator environment of the man-machine interface (MMC) 
or can represent the object-specific data so that it 

can be edited optionally. 
Numerical control according to claim 2, 
whereby all object classes including the sequence 

control system are constructed in the control-internal 
data management as abstract data models, whereby the 

data models can be supplemented with abstract 
application-specific data types, or can be modified by 

application-specific object instances. 
Numerical control according to one of the 
above claims, whereby the object combinations can be 

provided with selective access mechanisms.
