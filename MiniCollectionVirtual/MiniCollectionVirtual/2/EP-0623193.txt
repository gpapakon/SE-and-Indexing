<DESCRIPTION>
 Operating deviceThe invention relates to an operating device with a top part having an actuating arrangement for driving a control member, and a bottom part carrying the top part, wherein the top part and the bottom part are releasably connected with one another by means of a bayonet lock wherein essentially radial projections on one of the parts are held in the other part, the connection being effected by inserting the projections into recesses in the other part and turning the two parts in relation to each other.Such an operating device is known from DE 40 13 875 Al. This publication relates to an electromagnetic valve, in the top part of which there is provided an armature and an energizing coil and in the bottom part of which there is provided a valve seat and corresponding inlet and outlets.The top part and the bottom part are joined together by a bayonet joint. In the one part there is provided an oval opening for inserting of the other part, said opening having at two 180° displaced places an undercut recess (26) which extends radially each over 90°. The other part having radial side extensions (16) corresponding to the diameter of the free part (29) of the oval opening. By turning the one part (the upper part) 90° the radial extension moves into the undercut recess (25) . This joint is expensive, the half of the magnetic acutator part (10) is picked up by the valve housing (22) , and the magnetic actuator is not locked in the mounted position, and may due to e.g. vibrations loosen after some time. Therefore it is necessary to lock the 

magnetic actuator by means of a wall part (33) of a not shown cover, picking up the electric connector pins (13).DE 36 09 366 C2 shows a corresponding bayonet joint in which knob-like extensions (10,13) provides for catch-in locking of the parts. Such a locking is not reliable.An operating device is further known, for example, from EP 0 151 563 A2. That publication relates to an electromagnetic valve, in the top part of which there is provided an armature and an energizing coil and in the bottom part of which there is provided a valve seat and corresponding inlet and outlets. The top part and the bottom part are screwed together, that is to say, the top part has a foot with an external thread which is screwed into an internal thread in a bore in the bottom part. In order to join the top part and the bottom part together, it is necessary to rotate the top part several times relative to the bottom part. This can lead to difficulties if the upper part has already

Patent Claims
1. An operating device with a top part having an actuating arrangement for driving a control member, and a bottom part carrying the top part, wherein the top part and the bottom part are releasably connected with one another by means of a bayonet lock wherein essentially radial projections on one of the parts are held in the other part, the connection being effected by inserting the projections into recesses in the other part and turning the two parts in relation to each other, characterized in that the said radial projections are essentially pimple-like projections (18) , that the recesses (19) are formed in a resilient locking ring (16) held in the other part, and that the projections (18) slide in beneath the locking ring (16) when the two parts (2, 3) are turned.
2. A device according to claim 2, characterized in that the locking ring (16) is held in its part (3) by a flanged edge (17) .
3. A device according to claim 3, characterized in that the locking ring (16) is supported by an annular face (15) on the side opposing the flanged edge (17) .
4. A device according to one of claims 2 to 4, characterized in that the locking ring (16) is mounted so that it is rotatable at least in one direction and has an externally accessible turning-moment engagement face (30) .
5. A device according to claim 5, characterized in that the locking ring (16) has at least one radial opening (26) and the part (3) carrying the locking ring 


has at least one externally accessible slot (27) with which the opening (26) is caused to coincide.
6. A device according to claim 6, characterized in that the slot (27) interrupts the flanged edge (17) and/or the annular face (15) .
7. A device according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in that several openings (26) and several slots (27) are provided, the number of openings (26) and the number of slots (27) having no common divisor greater than 1.
8. A device according to one of claims 5 to 8, characterized in that the locking ring (16) has a resilient tongue (24) which, on rotational movement of the locking ring (16) in one direction wedges against the part (3) carrying the locking ring (16) and on rotational movement in the other direction slides along the part.
9. A device according to claim 9, characterized in that the tongue is formed by a cut (25) in the locking ring (16) extending in the circumferential direction, at one end of which there adjoins a radial cut (26) , the region circumscribed by the cuts being bent out of the plane of the locking ring (16) .
10. A device according to one of claims 2 to 10, characterized in that the recesses (19) in the locking ring (16) are substantially rectangular in shape, corners (21, 22) that form the transition from the recesses (19) into the circumferential edge (20)
4
 being bent in opposite directions out of the plane of the locking ring (16) .
0 refers to the "inner edge" elsewhere - translator. 


11. A device according to one of claims 2 to 11, characterized in that the locking ring (16) has formations (23) projecting into the path of the radial projections (18) , or arranged next to it.
12. A device according to one of claims 1 to 12, characterized in that the part (2) carrying the radial projections (18) comprises a beaker-shaped housing (8) which continues in a sleeve-like foot (9) of circular cross-section that carries the radial projections (18) , the housing (9) and the foot (8) being of integral construction and being made, in particular, of metal.
13. A device according to one of claims 1 to 13, characterized in that it is in the form of an electromagnetic valve (1) with an armature (6) that is movable in the top part (2) , which armature projects into the bottom part (3) .
14. A device according to claim 14, characterized in that the armature (6) is mounted in an armature tube that is fixed in the foot (9) and projects into the bottom part (3) .
