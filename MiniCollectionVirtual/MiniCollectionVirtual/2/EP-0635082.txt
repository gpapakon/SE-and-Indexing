<ABSTRACT>
A machine (57) for working the ballast of a track (60) has a frame (58) supported on rail travelling gears (59), a suction unit (76) with an opening (81) for sucking off the broken stones, and a vertically and laterally adjustable suction hose (80). In addition, a clearing device (62) is arranged at a distance from the suction opening (81), in the longitudinal direction of the machine, and has an endless clearing chain (64) rotatable by a drive for removing the broken stones located below the track (60). Both the clearing device (62) and the suction hose (80) are provided with their own drives (82, 99), so that they may be vertically and laterally adjusted independently from each other.

A machine (1; 51; 57; 88) for treating the ballast bed 
of a track, having a machine frame (10, 11; 53; 58) supported 

on on-track undercarriages (8, 9; 52; 59), a suction unit 
(14; 76) with a suction pipe (27; 80) provided with a suction 

opening (25; 81) for sucking off ballast being associated 
with said machine frame (10, 11; 53; 58), said suction pipe 

(27; 80) being vertically and laterally adjustable for 
immersion between two adjacent sleepers of the track, 

characterized by a clearing apparatus (35; 62) arranged at a 
distance from the suction opening (25; 81) and provided with 

an endless clearing chain (38; 64) rotatable by a drive (41; 
63) for removing the ballast situated below the track (3; 

60), separate drives (22, 34; 82, 99, 92) being associated 
with the clearing apparatus (35; 62) and the suction pipe 

(27; 80) respectively for vertical and lateral adjustment 
independently from one another. 
A machine according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the clearing apparatus (35) is formed by at least one 

clearing beam (36) which extends perpendicularly to the 
longitudinal direction of the machine during operation and is 

provided with deflection pulleys (37) arranged at the ends of 
said clearing beam (36), the clearing chain (38) guided about 

the deflection pulleys (37) being designed for rotation in a 
plane which is horizontal and parallel to the track plane. 
A machine according to claim 2, characterized in that a 
suction opening (39) of a suction tube (40) is associated 

with the clearing apparatus (35) in the area of the 
deflection pulley (37) situated in a sleeper end zone during 

operation, the suction tube (40) being connected to the 
suction unit (14).  

 
A machine according to one of claims 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the suction pipe (27) projecting beyond 

one machine end (21) and movable by a carrier frame (24), 
the suction unit (14) and a conveyor belt unit (18) which is 

arranged on the machine end (20) distanced farther from the 
suction pipe (27) are arranged on a first machine unit (5), 

whereas the clearing apparatus (35), a work cabin (30) 
allocated thereto and a conveyor belt unit (33) extending in 

the longitudinal direction of the machine and disposed on a 
machine end (32) are arranged on a second machine unit (6) 

which is connectable to the first machine unit (5) by means 
of a coupling (7). 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that an end (42) of the suction tube (40) 

distanced from the suction opening (39) of the clearing 
apparatus (35) is provided with a coupling (43) for 

detachable connection with the suction pipe (27) of the first 
machine unit (5), said coupling being arranged in the region 

of a machine end (29) of the second machine unit (6) 
distanced from the conveyor belt unit (33). 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the suction opening (25) attached to 

the carrier frame (24) of the first machine unit (5) is 
provided with a coupling (26) for detachable connection with 

the suction pipe (27). 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the machine frame (53) comprises a 

first and a second frame part (55, 56) by forming an 
articulated joint (54) supported on the track by an on-track 

undercarriage (52), the suction unit (14) and a first 
conveyor belt unit (18) situated partly below it and  

 
extending in the longitudinal direction of the machine being 

associated with the first frame part (55), said conveyor belt 
unit (18) having an ejection end (19) projecting beyond a 

free machine end (20) opposite the articulated joint (54), 
and the second frame part (56) being provided with the 

carrier frame (24) vertically and laterally adjustable by 
drives (22) and connected to the suction opening (25) of the 

suction pipe (27), with the clearing apparatus (35) and a 
second conveyor belt unit (33) being partly disposed at the 

rear machine end (32). 
A machine according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the clearing chain (64) of the clearing apparatus (62) 

is designed to be guided around the track (60) during 
operation by forming a transverse chain member (65) and two 

longitudinal guide tracks (66) connected thereto, said 
transverse chain member extending perpendicularly to the 

longitudinal direction of the machine and horizontally, and 
that said clearing chain (64) has a discharge point (68) 

disposed above a screening system (67) for cleaning the 
ballast. 
A machine according to claim 8, characterized in that 
the suction pipe (80) is designed to project beyond a machine 

end (75). 
A machine according to claim 8 or 9, characterized in
