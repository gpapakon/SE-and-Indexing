<ABSTRACT>
A method for bending metallic plates along a straight bending line comprises a local heating of a selected strip section of a plate with an impinging wide energy stream. Thereupon, the selected strip section is cooled by means of a cooling stream of a liquid. In this case, the cooling stream moves at a short distance behind the energy stream. Thereby, there results a bending of the plate, where a convexity is produced on the side of the plate impinged by the wide energy stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Method of bending metal objects.The subject of the invention is the method of bending and overbending of metal objects, plates and shells of zero Gaussian curvature, along a straight line or along a set of straight lines. The method can be used to initially bend a plate along straight lines in such a way that on the side to which heat radiation is applied a convexity is formed, and then to further bend the initially bent plates by applying heat radiation to them along the straight lines both from the convex and the concave sides, obtaining in each case an increase of curvature and therefore also of the bending angle.The method makes it also possible to shape the objects of variable thickness, and in particular the objects made of hard and brittle metals. Shaping with this method is characterized by the fact that it does not require the use of shaping tools nor acting upon the object with external forces.Polish patent description no. 155358 made known the method of bending metal objects characterized by the use of a "narrow beam", narrow as compared to the thickness of the metal bent. It allows bending of plates and shells of zero Gaussian curvature in such a way that on the side subject to heat radiation a concavity is formed or enlarged. When, on the other hand, a shell of zero Gaussian curvature or an initially bent plate is being heated from the convex side, then this convexity will get diminished. The method of "narrow beam" has limited capacities of shaping the metal objects. It cannot be used to form closed cylindrical or conical surfaces of small internal diameters, since this would require introduction of the beam into the inside hollow space of these objects and then changing of the direction of the beam to the one perpendicular to the surface. The essence of the invention lies in the fact that the object shaped is subject to single or multiple local two-phase process of deep heating using the sufficiently broad energy beam along the straight line selected, and then cooling of the heated strip of metal in a natural manner or with the use of an external factor, in adequate distance behind the said beam. Consequently, the metal object undergoes permanent bending along the straight line, and in particular, 

when the flat plate is being heated a convexity is formed on the heated side, while when an initially bent plate or a shell with zero Gaussian curvature is heated then there will ensue the increase of the bending angle (increase of curvature), irrespective of the fact whether radiation was
