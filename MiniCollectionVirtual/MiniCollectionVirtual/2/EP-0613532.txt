<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for transmitting a rotational movement from a driving shaft (34) to a driven shaft (60), where the driven shaft, in accordance with a predetermined sequence, is imparted an angular velocity during its rotation which varies relative to the driving shaft. The driving shaft (34) has a drive wheel (36) with a plurality of curve grooves (42, 44, 46, 48) which have predetermined curve shapes with a slope which varies depending on the predetermined variation of the angular velocity of the driven shaft (60). The driven shaft (60) overlaps partially the driving wheel (36) and has a plurality of driver curve rollers (72) distributed circumferentially and which are disposed to be sequentially inserted into a respective curve groove in the driving wheel in order to be driven thereby during a portion of the rotation of the drive wheel until the subsequent curve roller (72) in the rotational direction is brought into rolling contact in a subsequent curve groove.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DEVICE FOR TRANSMITTING A ROTARY MOVEMENT FROM A PRICING SHAFT TO A DRIVEN SHAFT TO IMPART TO THE LATTER AN ANGULAR VELOCITY WHICH VARIES RELATIVE TO THAT OF THE DRIVING SHAFT.The present invention relates to a device for trans¬ mitting a rotational movement from a driving shaft to a driven shaft, where the driven shaft, in accordance with a predetermined sequence is imparted an angular velocity which varies during its rotation relative to the driving shaft.In certain branches of industry, a certain process may require that a driven operating shaft be rotated at an angular velocity which varies during its rotation. One example of such industrial activity is cigar manu¬ facturing, where a gripper carried by a driven shaft must capture a wrapper from a pick-up station and transport the wrapper to an apparatus where the wrapper is to be wrapped at a varying wrapping speed about a cigar body and be fixed thereto, whereafter the gripper returns to the pick-up station to pick up a new wrapper.In a known cigar wrapping machine, the wrapper gripper consists of a suction box adapted to the shape of the wrapper, carried on the outer end of a carrying arm extending radially from an oscillating working shaft, said arm being articulated at its centre portion. The working shaft is driven via a bevel gear which engages a driving toothed segment which supports a cam roller which engages a continuous curve groove in a rotating disc. As the disc rotates, the toothed segment and thus the working shaft are imparted, via an angle transmission, an oscillating movement by the engagement of the cam roller in the curve groove in the disc. The angular velocity of the oscillation movement is thus controlled by the slope 

 of the curve groove relative to the centre of the disc. Thus the carrier arm for the suction box can be caused to swing back and forth in accordance with a desired pattern of motion, between a pick-up position for the wrappers and a delivery station where the wrapper can be gradually released from the suction box and be wrapped on a cigar body at the same time as the box is moved with varying speed over the length of the body.Machines of this type have operated for decades with great reliability and precision, and this has resulted in cigar products of high quality. However, the manu¬ facturing capacity of such a machine has been limited to about 30 cigars per minute. In view of this, it has been a goal to increase the manufacturing capacity while retaining high reliability and high quality.According to a
