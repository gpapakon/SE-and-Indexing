<ABSTRACT>
A method for ultrasonically inspecting a closely 
packed regular array of mutually parallel, uniformly 

sized and spaced rigid rods surrounded by a thin-walled 
metallic channel and immersed in a compressible medium. 

The method utilizes the properties of coherently scattered 
ultrasonic waves to identify rods which are defective, 

out of position or missing. A plane, monochromatic 
ultrasonic wave is transmitted toward the array of 

rods on one side thereof. Then an interference pattern 
produced on an opposing side of the array is detected. 

This interference pattern is the result of multiple 
scattering and diffraction of the plane ultrasonic wave 

during propagation through the array of rods. When the 
wavelength is comparable with the rod diameter and the 

rods are not too close together, scattering results in 
spatial relationships that produce an unusually large 

amount of wave penetration through the array in certain 
directions relative to the incident propagation vector. 

This is akin to Bragg scattering and is dependent on 
direction, wavelength, and details of the cylindrical 

array dimensions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to nondestructive 
examination of components of a nuclear power plant. In 
particular, the invention relates to ultrasonic inspection 
of the components of the fuel core of a nuclear 
reactor. Consider a long rod of radius α impacted by a plane 
wave of intensity I₀ and frequency ω traveling perpendicular 
to the rod axis, as depicted in FIG. 1. The 
spatial part of the wave pressure, p i, can be expanded 
in cylindrical harmonics as: 
where: 
ρ is the fluid density and c is the sonic velocity in 
the fluid. The radial velocity ui corresponding to the 
plane wave expansion is: 
The effect of a rod with its axis located at r = 
0 is to distort the incoming plane wave, thereby 
inducing a scattered outgoing wave of a size and shape 
sufficient to meet the zero radial velocity boundary 
condition at the rod surface: 
ui(kα) = -us(kα) where the scattered wave radial velocity us is: 
and the scattered wave pressure ps is: 
The Hankel function of the first kind: 
Hm(kr) ≡ Jm(kr) + iYm(kr) is descriptive of outgoing waves, valid for r ≧ α. The 
boundary condition (4) requires: 
which must be satisfied term-by-term. Therefore: 
Am = 
-P₀imεmJ'm(kα)H'm(kα)The ratio of the derivatives results in a complex 
function of kα, which can be written as: 
Am = 
-P₀im+1εme-iγmsin(γm) where: 
These phase shifts are the key to the behavior of the 
scattered wave and, therefore, to the total intensity 
pattern of the ultrasonic field. The total field intensity is given by: 
I(r,) = 12 
Re{ptu*t} = 12 
Re{[pi + ps][ui + 
us]*} where the factor of ½ is due to a time-average over a 
period of the wave. Evidently, computation of the phase 
shifts allows calculation of the total intensity as a 
function of spatial position relative to the axis of the 
rod. The direction  = 0 is defined to be that of the 
incoming wave propagation vector, as shown in FIG. 1. The normalized total intensity for a frequency of 
213.2 kHz, a rod radius of 6.13 mm and a field radius 
of 23 mm (kα = 5.3, kr = 31.4) is shown in a polar plot 
in FIG. 2. The incident wave propagates from left to 
right along the axis of symmetry. The rod axis is 
perpendicular to the plane of the page and is centered 
at the origin. The back-scatter is roughly isotropic, the side-scatter 
is small, and the forward-scatter has symmetrical 
lobes, the largest of which are centered at about 
±25° from the X axis. A significant amount of energy 
is scattered along the (forward) X axis. The oblique 
forward and back lobes are the result of
