<ABSTRACT>
Described is a drop-on-demand ink-jet printing head which 
comprises a base (44), a nozzle plate (43) defining a 

plurality of nozzle apertures (41,42) and an array of 
piezoelectric elements (45,46) each arranged at predetermined 

intervals and having one end which is fixed onto said base 
(44) and the other free end which is confronted with said 

nozzle apertures (41,42) of said nozzle plate (43). The 
piezoelectric elements (45,46) are formed by alternately 

stacking paste-like piezoelectric material and conductive 
material in the form of a layer, burning a lamination of said 

piezoelectric material and said conductive material to 
provide a piezoelectric plate, and cutting said piezoelectric 

plate into a plurality of piezoelectric elements with a

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drop-on-demand
ink-jet printing head for jetting ink, in the form of small
droplets, from an ink reservoir so as to form printed dots
on recording paper.Drop-on-demand ink-jet printing head can be classified
into three main types. The first type is a so-called
bubble jet type in which a heater for instantaneously
vaporizing ink is provided on the top end of a nozzle to
thereby produce and jet ink drop by expansion pressure
created during vaporization. In the second type, a piezoelectric
element provided in a vessel constituting an
ink reservoir flexes or expands in accordance with an
electrical signal applied thereto so as to jet ink in the
form of a drop by a force produced when the element
expands. In the third type, a piezoelectric element is
provided in an ink reservoir in opposition to a nozzle so
as to jet an ink drop by dynamic pressure produced in a
nozzle area upon expansion of the piezoelectric element.As disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No.
Sho-60-8953, the above-mentioned third type drop-on-demand
ink-jet printing head has a configuration
wherein a plurality of nozzle apertures are formed in a
wall of a vessel constituting an ink tank, and piezoelectric
elements are disposed at the respective nozzle
apertures matched in the direction of their expansion
and contraction with each other.In this printing head, a printing signal is applied to
the piezoelectric elements so as to selectively actuate
the piezoelectric elements to jet ink drops from the corresponding
nozzles by the dynamic force produced
when the piezoelectric elements are actuated to thereby
form dots on printing paper.In such a printing head, it is desirable that the efficiency
in ink drop formation and the force of ink drop jetting
are large. However, since the unit length of a
piezoelectric element and the rate of expansion/contraction
of the same per unit voltage are extremely
small, it is necessary to apply a high voltage to in order
to obtain sufficient jetting force for printing, and it is
therefore necessary to construct a driving circuit and
electric insulators so as to withstand such a high voltage.In order to obtain a high jetting force, document EP-A-0372521
discloses a drop-on-demand ink-jet printing
head in which a piezoelectric plate is fixedly attached to
an elastic metal plate and is cut and divided corresponding
to the arrangement of nozzle apertures, with
one end of the piezoelectric plate being fixed to a frame
while the other end thereof opposite to the nozzle
