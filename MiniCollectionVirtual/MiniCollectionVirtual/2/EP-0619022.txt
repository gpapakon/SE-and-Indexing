<ABSTRACT>
A sensor has at least one quartz body (1) cut out of a quartz crystal, a glass fiber linked to the quartz body in at least one given longitudinal section and means for detecting changes in length of the glass fibers caused by piezoelectrically determined deformations of the quartz body in an electrical field. It has been shown how the generally undesirable temperature dependence of the sensor measurement signal can be purely passively influenced and if required even eliminated by a mixture of both independent piezoelectric coefficients d11 and d14 which contribute to the piezoelectrically determined change in size of the quartz body.
