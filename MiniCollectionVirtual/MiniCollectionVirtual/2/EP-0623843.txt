<ABSTRACT>
Described herein is a low volume processor 
for processing photosensitive material which utilizes 

a narrow horizontal processing channel (25). A 
replenishment pump calibration system is integrated 

into the processor so that no manual measurements or 
special tools are required to set replenishment 

solution rates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to automatic
processors and is more particularly concerned with an
automatic replenishment, calibration and metering
system for such processors.The processing of photosensitive material
involves a series of steps such as developing,
bleaching, fixing, washing, and drying. These steps
lend themselves to mechanization by conveying a
continuous web of film or cut sheets of film or
photographic paper sequentially through a series of
stations or tanks, each one containing a different
processing liquid appropriate to the process step at
that station.There are various sizes of photographic film
processing apparatus, i.e., large photofinishing
apparatus and microlabs. A large photofinishing
apparatus utilizes tanks which contain approximately
100 liters of each processing solution. A small
photofinishing apparatus or microlab utilizes tanks
which may contain less than 10 liters of processing
solution.The chemicals contained in the processing
solution: cost money to purchase; change in activity
and are seasoned by the constituents of the
photosensitive material which leach out during the
photographic process; and after the chemicals are used
the chemicals must be disposed of in an
environmentally safe manner. Thus, it is important in
all sizes of photofinishing apparatus to reduce the
volume of processing solution. The prior arts suggest
various types of replenishing systems which add or 
subtract specific chemicals to the processing solution
to maintain a consistency of photographic
characteristics in the material developed.
Photosensitive material processing equipment typically
consists of several large volume tanks of processing
solution that the exposed photosensitive material is
driven or towed through to produce an image, as the
photosensitive material is processed the strength of
the processing solutions is diminished and will
eventually become exhausted. To prevent the continual
weakening of the processing solution additional fresh
processing solution is added to the tank solution at a
rate equivalent to the rate of use and rate of carry
out of the processing solution. The above maintains
processing solution activity and volume. Typically
the replenish is very small compared to the working
processing tank volume. A typical ratio of
replenishment per square foot of photosensitive.
material for a large volume tank would be 0.00025 to
0.00075 of the tank volume. Since the above ratio is
small the effect of pulsing delivery and cyclic
variation of the replenishment delivery by 5 or 10%
