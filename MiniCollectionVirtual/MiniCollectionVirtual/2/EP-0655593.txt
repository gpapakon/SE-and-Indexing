<ABSTRACT>
In a cooling system for cooling foodstuffs (1) in an aircraft, the foodstuffs are stored in transport containers generally known and the transport containers occupy prescribed reserved places inside the aircraft, preferably in at least one onboard kitchen (airplane kitchen) (3a-e). The invention provides that at least one central cold producing device (cold producing machine, refrigerating apparatus, refrigerant apparatus) (4) is arranged in the subfloor region of the aircraft, that the cold producing device (4) is connected to a distribution system consisting of feed and return lines (5, 6), and that the feed and return lines (5, 6) are connected via spur lines (tap lines, single feeders) (10a, 10b, 11a, 11b) to heat exchanging devices (9a, 9b, 17a, 17b) in the onboard kitchens (3a to 3e). It is advantageous that no additional thermal loads or noises are generated in the cabin space and that a substantial saving in space is realised. Instead of the cold producing device in each onboard kitchen, only a central cold producing device needs to be installed, as a result of which there is a substantial reduction in installation costs.

<CLAIMS>
Aircraft having a cooling system for cooling foodstuffs,
wherein the foodstuffs are stored in generally known

transport containers and the transport containers adopt
predetermined positioning locations, and wherein the

positioning locations are provided in a number of galleys
distributed within the aircraft cabin,
characterised in that

at least one central refrigerating apparatus (4) is
disposed in the under-floor region of the aircraft, the

refrigerating apparatus (4) is connected to a
distributing system consisting of a feed line (5) and a

return line (6), and the feed and return lines (5, 6) are
connected, via branch lines (10a, 10b, 11a, 11b), to

heat-exchanging apparatuses (9a, 9b, 17a, 17b) in the
galleys (3a to 3e).
Aircraft having a cooling system for cooling foodstuffs,
in accordance with claim 1,
characterised in that

the refrigerating apparatus (4) is disposed outside the
aircraft cabin.
Aircraft having a cooling system for cooling foodstuffs,
in accordance with one of claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that

the distributing system (5, 6) largely covers the entire
aircraft cabin region and preferably extends in the floor

region.
Aircraft having a cooling system for cooling foodstuffs,
in accordance with one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that

the branch lines (10a, 10b, 11a, 11b) are provided with
high-speed couplings which can be connected at variable

positions on the distributing system (5, 6). 
Aircraft having a cooling system for cooling foodstuffs,
in accordance with one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that

the distributing system (5, 6) consists of refrigerating
agent lines for a liquid refrigerating agent.
Aircraft having a cooling system for cooling foodstuffs,
in accordance with one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that

the refrigerating apparatus (4) is constructed as a
compression-type refrigerating machine.
Aircraft having a cooling system for cooling foodstuffs,
in accordance with claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that

the refrigerating apparatus (4) is, if need be, combined
with a skin heat-exchanger at the outer skin of the

aircraft.
Aircraft having a cooling system for cooling foodstuffs,
in accordance with claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that

the refrigerating apparatus (4) is constructed as a
liquid/air heat-exchanger, wherein an air flow from an

air-conditioning system flows through the liquid/air
heat-exchanger and heat is thereby extracted from the

refrigerating agent liquid in the distributing system.
Aircraft having a cooling system for cooling foodstuffs,
in accordance with one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that

the refrigerating apparatus (4) is constructed as a
sorption-type apparatus and the feed line (5) is

constructed as a refrigerant liquid line which is
connected to the heat-exchanging apparatuses constructed

as evaporation apparatuses (17a, 17b), and the return
line (6) is constructed as a refrigerant vapour line. 
Aircraft having a cooling system for cooling foodstuffs,
in accordance with one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that

at least one pump for transporting the cooling medium is
disposed inside the distributing system.
