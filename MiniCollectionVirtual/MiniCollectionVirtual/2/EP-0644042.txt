<ABSTRACT>
A tape laying machine comprises a tape head (6) carrying a main tape 
compactor (61) and a tail compactor (90), which are independently movable with 

respect to the head when compacting composite tape. The two compactors are 
connected together by power-driven linkages, to switch the two compactors 

alternatively to a tape laydown point defined with respect to the tape head.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to machines for laying and compacting 
composite tape, especially where compacting tape tails, i.e., trailing sections of 
tape strips which are narrower than full tape width. In the field of advanced composites, where a composite tape of fibre 
reinforced resin is laid on a tool to create laminated structures such as aircraft 
parts, it is necessary to lay progressive runs of tape at angles other than 90° and 
0° with the tool. When laying cross plies, for example at 45°, it is often necessary 
to cut the end of the tape strip at some angle other than 90° with the tape length, 
and a problem may arise when a primary compacting member spans adjacent 
pieces, which are carried on a backing. US-A-4557783 addresses the problem of tail compaction in a 
composite tape laying machine. The machine and compaction device are shown 
herein as Prior Art Figures 1, 2a, 2b, and 2c. The entire disclosure and teaching 
of the '783 patent is expressly incorporated herein by reference. Prior art Figure 
1 depicts a high rail gantry tape laying machine 10 wherein a tape laying head 11 
is transported coordinately on horizontal side rails 12 and transverse gantry rails 
13 under a program commanded by a numerical control (NC) unit 14. A 
contoured tape laydown surface 15, or tool, is positionable with respect to the 
tape laying head 11 to form laminated composite structures. The tape laying head 
11 comprises, in part, a main frame 16 supporting a tape supply reel 17. The 
supply reel 17 carries a tape structure 18 comprising a filamentous composite tape 
and a paper backing. The tape structure 18 is trained under a tape compactor 
unit 19 and backing is accumulated on a take-up reel 20, in a manner well-known 
in the art. The tape laying head 11 is movable along a vertical, or Z-axis 21 to 
adapt to changing tool heights along the tape path, and the entire tape head 11 
is rotatable around the vertical axis 21. Figure 2a depicts a schematic of the tape 
laying head 11 movable in a direction "X" with respect to a tool 22. The tape 
laying head 11 has a supply reel 17 which feeds out a tape structure 18 comprising  
 
a composite tape 23 releasably attached to a backing 24 such as a paper strip. 
The tape structure 18 feeds through a cutter unit 25 and tape guide chute 26 to 
its lowermost position, adjacent the tool 22, where it then passes under a presser 
shoe or primary compactor 27 of the tape compactor unit 19. As the tape 23 is 
pressed against the laydown surface 28 of the tool 22, the
