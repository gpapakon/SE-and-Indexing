<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a haymaking machine, especially a tedder for fodder laying down on the ground, including a bearing structure (1) which can be connected to a tractor, which structure (1) bears several rotors (12) which are mounted so that they can rotate on rotation spindles (16) which point downward, and some of which bear a wheel (17) for resting on the ground, and others bear two wheels (19 and 20) for resting on the ground. It is noteworthy in that each rotation spindle (16) which bears two resting wheels (19 and 20) includes a first resting wheel (19) which is stationary with respect to the said rotation spindle (16) and which is aligned with the fixed resting wheels (17) of the rotation spindles (16) which only have one wheel, and a second resting wheel (20) which can pivot with respect to the said rotation spindle (16).

Haymaking machine, especially a tedder for fodder lying on the soil, having 
a carrying structure (1) which can be connected to a tractor, which structure 

(1) carries several rotors (12) which are monted so that they can turn about 
axes of rotation (16) which are directed downwards and some of which bear 

one support wheel (17) and the others bear two support wheels (19 and 20), 

characterized in that
 each axis of rotation (16) which bears two support 
wheels (19 and 20) has a first support wheel (19) which is fixed with respect 

to the said axis of rotation (16) and which is aligned with the fixed support 
wheels (17) of the axes of rotation (16) which bear only one wheel and a 

second support wheel (20) which is pivoting with respect to the said axis of 
rotation (16). 
Machine according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the support wheels (17 
and 19) which are fixed are situated in front of the axes of rotation (16) of 

the rotors (12) and in that the support wheels (20) which are pivoting are 
situated behind the said axes of rotation (16). 
Machine according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the fixed support wheel 
(19) and the pivoting support wheel (20) which are connected to a same axis 

of rotation (16) are mounted on a rocking beam (23) which is articulated on 
the said axis of rotation (16) by means of a substantially horizontal pivot 

(24).
