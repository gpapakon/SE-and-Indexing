<ABSTRACT>
The relay includes a control input (1, 2) for receiving a control signal and two load output connections (3, 4). A bidirectional semiconductor load switch (43) connected between the load output connections is driven by the control signal. A switchable bypass line (18) is connected in parallel with the load switch. A threshold value detector (11) is provided. The bypass line is only connected through the threshold value detector when the instantaneous value of an alternating voltage on one of the output connections is smaller than a defined positive threshold value and greater than a defined negative threshold value.
