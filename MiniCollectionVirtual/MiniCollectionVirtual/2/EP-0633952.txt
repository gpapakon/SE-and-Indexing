<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for reducing 
the damage susceptibility of optically useful crystals 
of KTiOPO₄ and certain of its analogs. Crystals of KTiOPO₄ and its analogs are considered 
highly useful because of their nonlinear optical 
properties. U.S. Patent 3,949,323 teaches the use of 
crystals in nonlinear optical devices. Since KTiOPO₄ 
and its analogs are known to decompose upon melting, 
hydrothermal or flux methods have commonly been used to 
grow crystals of these compounds. U.S. Patent 
3,949,323, as well as others tench preparation of the 
crystals by hydrothermal methods. Indeed, despite the 
requirement for high pressures (on the order of hundreds 
of atmospheres), high temperatures, and relatively long 
crystal growth times, the art has generally conveyed a 
preference for hydrothermal methods of crystal growth. A desire for larger crystal size, better quality 
and greater durability, i.e., lower susceptibility to 
damage, as well as the disadvantages of hydrothermal 
processes have led to continued interest in flux growth 
techniques and to the development of a variety of flux 
processes. In U.S. Patent 4,231,838 crystal growth is 
carried out by heating certain mixtures of MTiOXO₄ with 
a nonaqueous flux M/X/O (where M is selected from K, Tl, 
and Rb and X is selected from P and As) or their 
precursors to produce a nonaqueous melt. More recently, 
U.S. Patent 5,084,206 discloses a flux method using 
selected dopants to produce crystals having lowered  
 
ionic conductivity, a feature desired for many 
applications. While the crystals produced by the known flux 
processes can have high optical quality, the rigors of 
certain optical applications, require high resistance to 
optical damage or lower susceptibility to optical damage 
than exhibited by most flux produced crystals, i.e., 
10 GW/cm². For example, in uses where the crystal is 
subjected to high electric fields or high power laser 
radiation, a typical flux crystal can develop "grey 
tracks" or even significantly darken throughout the 
crystal severely limiting the continued use of the 
crystal. Such damage is discussed, for example, in
