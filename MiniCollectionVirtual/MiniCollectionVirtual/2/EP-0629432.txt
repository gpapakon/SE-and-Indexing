<ABSTRACT>
Improved regenerative packing materials are made by 
coating conventional heat transfer packing structures 

with a washcoat containing a catalyst or an adsorbent. 
When these regenerative packing materials are used for 

the destruction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a 
regenerative system, they permit the use of lower average 

temperatures to oxidize the VOCs which improves 

operation and the life of the equipment. Catalysts 
include noble metals and base metals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improved, catalyzed 
packings for regenerative systems and their method of 
use. Regenerative systems used for the oxidation of 
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) contained in exhaust 
gases from industrial and chemical plants contain a 
combustion chamber, for heating the exhaust gases to 
temperatures that are sufficiently high enough to achieve 
thermal oxidation, and one or more columns packed with 
heat transfer material, that recover most of the sensible 
heat from the hot exhaust prior to venting. The operation of a regenerative system in its lined-out 
state (i.e., after initial start up) is illustrated 
in Figure 1. Process exhaust gases are preheated in 
column 1, that contains hot ceramic packing material 
which is cooled in the process. Hot gases pass through a 
combustion zone, that further heats exhaust to between 
1,400 and 1,600° F. VOCs undergo thermal oxidation 
primarily in the combustion zone. Hot exhaust passes 
over column 2 which contains cooler ceramic materials 
which recover the sensible heat and are themselves heated 
in the process. Cooled gas, nominally in the 300 to 
450°F temperature range, is then sent to the stack. A 
small fraction of the vent gas is used to purge column 3 
of adsorbed VOCs and this purge stream is returned to the 
burner. After a preallotted cycle time, which is determined  
 
by the configuration and design of the packed columns, 
the flow of exhaust gases is switched as is shown in 
Figure 2. Process exhaust is now preheated in column 2, 
which contains hot packing material, passed through the 
combustion zone, and used to preheat column 3, which 
contains cooler packing materials (purged during the 
prior cycle). Cooled exhaust is vented; a small fraction 
of vent gases is used to purge column 1 and returned to 
the combustion zone, and so on. The design of the packed columns is key to the heat 
recovery efficiency of the overall system. To ensure 
heat recovery of up to 95%, the size of the packed 
columns is typically large. The trend in the art of 
regenerative system design is toward smaller-sized units, 
for cost reduction and ease of installation. For 
example, U.S. Patent No. 5,163,829 describes a compact 
regenerative incinerator which includes a single vessel 
with two compartments separated by a partition. Each 
compartment includes an opening and a combustion chamber, 
and these are separated by a thermal storage medium. Heat transfer packing materials are conventionally 
made up of inorganic metals or metal
