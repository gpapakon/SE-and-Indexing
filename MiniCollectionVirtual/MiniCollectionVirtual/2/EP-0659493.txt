<ABSTRACT>
A single strand block-type rolling mill has pairs of 
oppositely inclined work rolls (16) arranged successively 

along a mill pass line (18) to roll rod and bar products 
in a twist-free manner. A planar base structure extends 

in parallel relationship between the mill pass line. A 
plurality of housings (32) are arranged seriatim along the 

mill pass line. The housings are secured to the base 
structure and have mutually overlapping portions secured 

to one another. Each housing includes intermediate drive 
components for driving a pair of roll shafts (40) carrying 

one of the work roll pairs, with the intermediate drive 
components being mechanically coupled to each other and to 

a common mill drive.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to rolling mills, and is concerned in particular with an
improved single strand block-type mill for rolling products such as bars, rods and the like in a
twist-free manner.Typical examples of conventional single strand block-type rolling mills are shown in U.S.
Pat. Nos. Re28,107 (Wilson et al) and 3,610,014 (Weber). In these mills, the successive roll
stands, which each include a bevel gear housing carrying a removable roll package, are located
on a common side of the mill pass line. This requires a rather complicated and heavy base
structure which adds significantly to the overall cost of the mill.Other mill designs, such as for example those described in German Pat. No. 970,102
(granted 21 Aug. 1958) and in the September 1958 issue of Iron and Steel Engineer at pages 65-67,
have opted for a different "X" type arrangement, where successive mill stands are
alternatively arranged on opposite sides of the pass line. These mills mount the roll stands on
the sloping faces of inverted V-shaped support pedestal. Some cost savings can be achieved with
this type of base structure. However, other problems, including lack of vertical and longitudinal
compactness, lack of sufficient structural rigidity, and a high noise level attributable to sound
reverberation within the enclosed space underlying the support pedestal, more than offset any
cost saving, thereby rendering such designs impractical for most commercial applications. Still another mill design is disclosed in US Patent No. 4,537,055
(Woodrow et al). Here, the gear housings are carried on a base
structure comprising a weldment made up of a flat vertically upstanding
structural member standing on edge and joined to an underlying base
plate in a generally inverted "T" configuration. The structural member
extends beneath and in parallel relationship to the mill pass line.
Reinforcing rib members extend laterally away from and are spaced along
opposite sides of the structural member. The rib members are joined on
edge to both the structural member and the base plate and have upper
support edges on which the gear housings are secured.An objective of the present invention is the provision of a single
strand block-type mill having an improved base structure which is
simpler in design as compared with the base structures of the
conventional mills described above.A companion objective of the present invention is the provision of
a base structure which coacts in mechanically interlocked engagement
with the gear housings of the

<CLAIMS>
A single strand block-type rolling mill having
pairs of oppositely inclined work rolls (16) arranged

successively along a pass line (18) to roll products such
as bars or rods in a twist-free manner, comprising: a

planar base structure (20) extending in parallel relationship
to the mill pass line (18), a plurality of housings (32)

arranged seriatim along the pass line (18), said housings
(32) being

secured to said base structure (20) and having mutually
overlapping portions secured to one another, each of said

housings (32) including intermediate drive means
(34, 36, 38)

for driving a
pair of roll shafts (40) carrying one of said pairs of

work rolls (16), said intermediate drive means (34, 36, 38) being
mechanically coupled to each other and to a common mill

drive (12, 14).
A rolling mill as claimed in claim 1 wherein
said mutually overlapping portions are secured to one

another at interfaces lying on a common reference plane
(P).
A rolling mill as claimed in claim 2 wherein
said reference plane also contains said pass line.
A rolling mill as claimed in claim 3 wherein
said base structure extends horizontally beneath said pass

line. 
A rolling mill as claimed in claim 4 wherein
said reference plane is perpendicular to said base

structure.
A rolling mill according to any one of claims 1
to 5 wherein said base structure comprises a plate member

(20).
