<ABSTRACT>
Hydraulic rotation stabilizer for railway vehicles for damping the rolling motion of bogies with one or more axles while simultaneously isolating the forces and motions in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle, in which case, on each chassis, one or more sufficiently rigid torsional rods (2) are mounted at at least two bearing points (1) on the wagon body (1a) in the direction transverse to the longitudinal axis (y axis) of the vehicle in the horizontal plane so as to be capable of rotating about the y axis, at the two ends of which torsional rods (2) the forces which originate from the rotational motion, to be stabilized, of the bogies are applied to the torsional rod (2) as moment via a hydraulic damping element (5) or a coupling rod (6) of the bogie frame (7a) by means of levers (3) which are positioned upright, or else suspended in the vertical direction (z axis) and suitable joints (4, 7), it being possible for a coupling rod (6) to be arranged as a connection to the bogie frame (7a) at each individual torsional rod (2), on one lever (3) at most, while the levers (3) can be equipped with any number of hydraulic damping elements (5), arranged in any desired way, as a connection to the bogie frame (7a).
