<ABSTRACT>
The assessment of clearance conditions in an operating turbine structure has provide difficult to achieve. The invention provides apparatus which enables the clearance between seal fins on rotating blades and adjacent fixed structure, to be observed during rotation, and comprises refracting prisms (30, 32) on the fixed structure arranged so as to straddle sealing fins (14) on the blades. The stage of blades on their associated disc are moved towards the fixed structure and light which is refracted through the prisms is obscured by the fins. In one embodiment, the ratio of obscured to unobscured light is utilised to generate electrical signals, which are then manipulated so as to indicate the magnitude of the clearance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the observing of the 
magnitude of an axial gap between relatively rotating 
parts in eg a fluid flow engine. The invention has particular efficacy when used to 
observe the running clearance between, say, fixed stators 
and rotating turbine blades and between blade shroud fins 
and a casing surrounding them. According to the present invention a method of 
observing a gap between relatively rotating parts 
comprises connecting first and second radiation 
transmitting members to a fixed part of a turbine, the 
first and second members being in a spaced relationship 
and are arranged so that the members protrude towards an 
opposing face of a rotatable part of the turbine, 
the first and second members being adapted and aligned 
relative to one another to direct a beam of radiation 
from the first transmitting member to the second 
transmitting member, positioning a projection on said 
opposing face to ensure passage of the beam between the first 
and second members during rotation of the rotatable part, 
measuring the amount by which the beam of radiation 
passing between the first and second members is obscured 
by the projection so as to provide an indication of the 
magnitude of the gap. The invention further provides apparatus for 
effecting the method. Apparatus fixed in a turbine 
comprises first and second radiation transmitting members 
which are connected in spaced relationship to a fixed 
part of the turbine so that the members protrude towards 
an opposing face of a rotatable part of the turbine, the 
first and second members being adpated and aligned 
relative to one another to direct a beam of radiation 
from the first transmitting member to the second 
transmitting member characterised in that a projection is  
 
positioned on the opposing face to ensure passage of the beam 
between the first and second members during rotation of 
the rotatable part, means being provided for measuring 
the amount by which the beam of radiation passing between 
the first and second members is obstructed when the 
projection on the opposing face of the rotatable part of 
the turbine passes between the members.  
 The invention will now be described, by way of 
example and with reference to the accompanying drawings 
in which: Fig 1 is a diagrammatic, axial cross sectional view 
of an array of fixed stators and rotatable turbine 
blades, incorporating an embodiment of the present 
invention. Fig 2 is an exploded view of one embodiment of 
radiation beam refracting means in accordance
