<ABSTRACT>
A one step process for the preparation of toner compositions which comprises adding 
to an extruder a base resin, initiator, pigment, and optional charge enhancing additive; 

effecting crosslinking of the base resin in the extruder to provide a toner comprising a pigment, 
optional charge additive and crosslinked resin comprising linear portions and crosslinked 

portions; and wherein said crosslinked portions are comprised of densely crosslinked microgel 
particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to processes for the preparation of toners,
and more specifically to economical one step direct processes for modifying toner resin
characteristics, and the preparation of toner compositions thereafter. More specifically, the
present invention relates to melt mixing processes, batch or continuous, and preferably
continuous processes such as, for example, extrusion for the preparation of toner compositions,
and wherein the toner resin is comprised of certain crosslinked fraction generated during toner
preparation, reference copending patent applications EP-A-550,989and EP-A-553,559, which
applications illustrate, for example, melt mixing processes for preparing toner including the
first step of a reactive melt mixing process to crosslink a base resin and the second step of a melt
mix process to prepare a toner from the crosslinked resin by incorporating toner additives.
With the processes of the above disclosures, two melt mixing steps are selected to prepare a
toner from a base resin. The present invention combines the reactive melt mixing and the
toner additive mixing in a one step process. Thus, with the processes of the present application,
only one melt mixing step or one operation through a melt mixing device is needed for
preparing toner directly from a base resin, and which process offers economical advantages.
The toner prepared in accordance with the processes of the present invention can be selected
for heat fixable imaging and printing, such as xerographic methods, and wherein there results
excellent fusing and vinyl offset performance.Toner utilized in development in the electrographic process is generally prepared by
mixing and dispersing a colorant and a charge enhancing additive into a thermoplastic binder
resin, followed by micropulverization.Toner can be fixed to a support medium such as a sheet of paper or transparency by
different fixing methods, the use of hot roll fixing being common and advantageous.Fixing performance of the toner can be characterized as a function of temperature.
The lowest temperature at which the toner adheres to the support medium is referred to as the
cold offset temperature (COT), and the maximum temperature at which the toner does not
adhere to the fuser roll is known as the hot offset temperature (HOT). When the fuser
temperature exceeds HOT, some of the molten toner adheres to the fuser roll during fixing and
is transferred to subsequent substrates containing developed images, resulting for example in
blurred

A one step process for the preparation of toner compositions which comprises
adding to a melt mixing device a base resin, initiator, pigment, and optional charge enhancing

additive; effecting crosslinking of the base resin in the melt mixing device by raising the temperature
to from 10°C to 100°C above the onset temperature of said crosslinking and providing high shear to

provide a toner composition comprising a pigment, optional charge additive and crosslinked resin comprising
linear portions and crosslinked portions; and wherein said crosslinked portions comprise large, three

dimensional networks of macromolecules, which networks possess a sufficiently high molecular
weight so that they are insoluble, or substantially insoluble in solvents, and form high molecular weight

densely crosslinked gel particles, wherein said gel particles are less than about 0.1 micron in
diameter and are substantially uniformly distributed in said resin.
A process in accordance with claim 1 wherein the melt mixing device is an extruder.
A process in accordance with claim 2 wherein the melt blending is
accomplished in the extruder and wherein said microgel particles are present in an amount of from

about 0.001 to 50 percent, and preferably, from 0.1 to about 40 percent by weight of said toner
resin.
A process in accordance with claim 2 wherein the extruder barrel temperature is

extruder sequentially at upstream and downstream supply ports.
