<ABSTRACT>
The casting flow control device described comprises a fixed top plate (8), a mobile plate (10) on a carriage (9) and a casting tube (2). The flow is controlled by sliding the mobile plate (10) against the top plate (8), the casting tube (2) being held immobile against the mobile plate (10), immediately below the casting orifice (27) of the mobile plate (10) blocking the pouring hole (15). The casting tube (2) is held immobile with respect to the mobile plate (10) by upward-pushing means (31) rigidly mounted on the carriage (9).

<CLAIMS>
Device for regulating a continuous casting flow
under a casting pocket, comprising a 
cover-pusher (7)
containing a fixed upper plate (8) and mounted on a

rectangular metal frame (4), which is constructed so as
to be pivotable with respect to a bottom wall (5) of the

casting pocket (3), and carrying a trolley comprising
guide means for a casting tube (2) which is pressed

against a mobile plate (10) which is in leak-free
contact with the fixed upper plate (8), the two plates

being held against each other by pressing devices, the
mobile plate (10) and the casting tube (2) being capable

of being moved simultaneously from a position closing
off the casting hole to a position opening the casting

hole (15) and 
vice versa
, 
characterised in that
 the
pressing devices consist of first and second pushing

means, the first pushing means (12) being means for
pushing downwards, which apply the upper plate (8)

against a reference plane formed by the mobile plate
(10) and the second pushing means being means (31) for

pushing upwards acting independently of the means for
pushing downwards onto guides which apply the casting

tube (2) against the mobile plate (10), by following the
movement of the mobile plate between its positions of

closing off and opening the casting hole (27).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the cover-pusher (7) is articulated on the metal frame
(4) about second pivots (18).
Device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in
that
 the device (12) for pressing the fixed upper plate
(8) against the mobile plate (10) consists of two sets

of spring-loaded cartridges (13, 14) arranged on either
side of the casting hole (15) along opposing sides of

the fixed upper plate (8). 
Device according to claim 3, 
characterised in that

the spring-loaded cartridges (13, 14) are held in place
by a compression plate (16) which is detachably fixed on

the cover-pusher (7) with the aid of pins (17).
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 the second pivots (18) are
parallel to the first pivots (6).
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 the mobile trolley (9)
shifts the mobile plate (10) from a position closing off

the casting hole (15) towards a position opening up the
casting hole (15) in order to regulate the casting flow,


characterised in that
 the mobile trolley shifts, with
the mobile plate (10), a device for supplying and

loading the tube.
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 the guide means (19, 20)
carried by the trolley (9) are perpendicular to the

direction of movement of the trolley (9) at the time of
regulating the casting flow.
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 the trolley (9) moves
along a guide path which is perpendicular to the first

pivots (6).
