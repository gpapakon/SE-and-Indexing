Fuel injection pump for internal combustion
engines having a pump piston which is driven by a cam

drive and which encloses a pump working space in a pump
cylinder, from which pump working space fuel is delivered

under high pressure to a fuel injection valve during
the delivery stroke of the pump piston, the cam

drive having an essentially stationary part and a moving
part driven by a drive shaft of the injection pump,

of which parts one is provided with a cam track and of
which the moving part, following the cam track, simultaneously

moves the pump piston by means of which a
reaction force is exerted via the cam track on the

essentially stationary part, and having an adjustment
piston (2) which encloses a working space (7) in a

cylinder (1), which working space is supplied with
pressurized medium from a pressurized medium source and

is adjustably connected by the pressurized medium,
against a return force (3), to the essentially stationary

part of the cam drive, the reaction force being
directed in the same direction as the return force and,

with its adjustment, adjusts the beginning of the high-pressure
delivery stroke of the pump piston relative to

a rotational position of the drive shaft, and the
pressurized medium pressure in the working space (7) is

controlled to modify the beginning of the delivery
stroke as a function of operating parameters of the

internal combustion engine and having an extraction
appliance for the controlled extraction of pressurized

medium quantities from the working space (7) during the 
high-pressure delivery stroke of the pump piston, the

working space (7) having a pressurized medium supply
line (15) containing a control element (17, 34) and

leading from the pressurized medium source and having a
pressurized medium drain line (16), with an electrically

controlled relief valve (18), leading to a relief
space, by means of which the pressure in the working

space (7) is controlled to modify the respective beginning
of the delivery stroke in such a way that this is

set in each case before the beginning of the delivery
stroke of each pump piston delivery stroke,

characterized in that the extraction of pressurized
medium quantities through the extraction appliance is

controlled as a function of the pressure in the working
space or of this pressure in the pump working space

which has an influence during the high-pressure

delivery stroke.
Fuel injection pump according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the extraction appliance consists

of a pressure retention valve (33) which is continually
connected to the working space (7) and by means of

whose opening pressure, the variation in pressure in
the working space (7) or in the pump working space is

determined during the high-pressure delivery stroke of
the pump piston.
Fuel injection pump according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the extraction device has a movable

wall (11) which is hydraulically adjacent to the
working space (7) and is acted on at its back by a preloaded

spring (12) which is set in such a way that the
movable wall is adjusted after a certain pressure is

reached in the working space or pump working space.
Fuel injection pump according to Claim 3,
characterized in that a displacement limiting stop (14)

is provided on the back of the movable wall (11) for
the motion of the movable wall against the force of the

preloaded spring (12) and the prescribed pressure lies
in the middle range of the pressure which can be

achieved by the pump piston over the operating range of 
the fuel injection pump during its respective delivery

stroke.
Fuel injection pump according to Claim 3 or 4,
characterized in that the preloaded spring is supported

at a fixed location on the pump housing.
Fuel injection pump according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the control

element in the pressurized medium supply line (15) is a
non-return valve (17) which opens in the direction of

the working space.
Fuel injection pump according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the relief valve (18) is used as

an extraction appliance and is open during at least
part of the delivery stroke of the pump piston as a

function of operating parameters.
Fuel injection pump according to Claim 7,
characterized in that the relief valve (18) is opened

as a function of the pressure reached in the pump
working space after a specified pressure has been

exceeded.
Fuel injection pump according to Claim 7,
characterized in that the relief valve (18) is

controlled by an injection duration regulation, the
injection duration being measured by a sensor recording

the duration of opening of an injection valve supplied
by the injection pump.
Fuel injection pump according to one of
Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the control

element in the pressurized medium supply line is an
electrically controlled supply valve (34).
Fuel injection pump according to Claim 10,
characterized in that the relief valve (18) and the

supply valve (34) are preferably activated in a pulsed
manner with variable pulse duty factor between the

operating periods in which the pump piston carries out
its delivery stroke in order to modify the pressure in

the working space (7) which controls the setting of the
currently desired beginning of the delivery stroke.
