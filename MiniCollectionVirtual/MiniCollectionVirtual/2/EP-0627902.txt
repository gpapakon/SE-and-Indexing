<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hip joint prosthesis comprising an attachment part for a ball unit (18) being designed to be anchored in the neck of a human femur (collum femoris), said attachment part, which is intended to be inserted into a channel (5, 14) extending through the femoral collum, being provided with parts for carrying a ball or caput (18) intended to be attached to the collum after removal of the head of the collum. The attachment part also comprises a fixture part comprising two main parts, a first part (1) which is to extend through a bore-hole (5) from the collum femoris towards the outer side of the femur and a second part (2) intended to fit into a cylindrical cavity cut into the cancellous bone of the collum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hip joint prosthesis for permanent anchoring in the human hip
joint comprising an attachment part for a ball unit designed to be anchored in the neck of a
human femur (collum femoris), said attachment part, which is intended to be inserted into a
channel extending through the femoral collum, being provided with parts for carrying a
prosthetic ball unit or caput intended to be attached to the collum after removal of the head
of the femur.The present invention is a development of a hip joint prosthesis of the kind disclosed in
WO 89/11837. This document inter alia discloses a hip joint prosthesis comprising a
primary fixture in the shape of a sleeve, said sleeve being intended to be inserted into a
central hole bored longitudinally through the collum femoris from the outer side of the
femur and a secondary fixture in the shape of a cap having a spherical shape intended to be
attached to and cover the end of the collum femoris when the head of the collum has been
removed partly or entirely and the outside of remaining end has been cut to a cylindrical
shape. The primary and the secondary fixtures are interconnected by means of a bolt which
at one end has an internal thread. The bolt is to be inserted into the sleeve and its internal
thread is to be made to engage a central, threaded stud projecting from the spherical cap.
When the bolt is tightened, the cap is pressed over the cylindrically cut caput or end of the
collum.The prior art device thus is relatively complicated, both in construction and use.In some applications it may furthermore not be suitable to use this prior art device. One
reason for this is that the shape of the collum may make it difficult to retain enough
cortical bone to give the secondary fixture or cap a firm support, since the shape of the
collum may vary to a great extent. This prior art device is also designed to be inserted in a two-seance procedure, i. e. some
parts of the prosthesis are to be inserted in a first operation, the remaining parts being
inserted later in a second operation after a healing period of a few months.Other similar prior art is disclosed for instance in DE- Al-28 45 231, DE-A1-27 24 040,
US-A-4,795,473 and US-A- 4,005,495.Further, the document DE-A-2 854 334 relates to an endoprosthesis, in particular a femur
endoprosthesis for a hip joint with a marrow cavity shaft running in the longitudinal
direction of the bone, and a femur neck part running in the direction of the neck of the
femur and supporting a joint head allocated to

<CLAIMS>
An attachment for anchorage to a human femur for carrying a prosthetic ball unit
(18) of a hip joint prosthesis having a forward end, a rearward end and a structure

extending axially therebetween comprising an externally screw threaded forward fixture
part (1, 2) which presents the forward end for anchorage in a channel (5, 14) provided in

the neck (6) of the human femur and a rearward carrying part (13, 16) connected to the
forward fixture part (1, 2) which presents the rearward end for carrying the prosthetic ball

unit (18), wherein the forward fixture part (1, 2) comprises a cylindrical forward portion
(1) of a first diameter and a cylindrical rearward portion (2) of a second diameter greater

than the first diameter of the cylindrical forward portion (1) wherein the external screw
threads (3, 15) of the forward and rearward portions (1, 2) are adapted so that the forward

fixture part (1, 2) is able to be screwed into the channel (5, 14) with the external screw
threads (3, 15) turning simultaneously in the bone tissue of the channel (5, 14)


characterised in that
 the forward portion (1) is releasably connectable to the rearward
portion (2).
An attachment as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the forward and
rearward portions (1, 2) of the forward fixture part are adapted to be pre-assembled.
An attachment as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the rearward
portion (2) is provided with an internally threaded bore (27) and the forward portion (1) is

provided with an externally threaded protrusion (17) for screwing into the internally
threaded bore (27) to secure the forward portion (1) to the rearward portion (2).
