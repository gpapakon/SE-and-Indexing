<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated
Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP).Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count below 150 x 109 per liter, and can be
due to a number of different disorders, including, for example, impaired production of
platelets by the bone marrow, platelet sequestration due to splenomegaly, or increased
destruction of platelets in the peripheral circulation. Based upon their underlying cause, the
throbocytopenias can be divided into different categories [Schafer, A.I., "Thrombocytopenia
and Disorders of Platelet Function" pp. 1041-1049 in Internal Medicine, 3rd Edition, John J.
Hutton et al., Eds., Little Brown and Co., Boston/Toronto/London, 1990]. One of these
categories, immune (autoimmune) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an uncommon illness
caused by the production of antibodies to platelets and the subsequent destruction of
platelets by the reticuloendothelial system. The autoantibody is usually IgG although other
immunoglobulins have also been reported. The clinical bleeding manifestations of ITP depend
on the severity of the condition, and possible associated coagulation effects. In severe cases,
bleeding can be life threatening [Morris et al.,Ann. Int. Med.96, 714-717 (1982)]. Chronic
ITP is usually accompanied by increased megakaryocytes in the bone marrow and frequently
by an elevated platelet-associated immunoglobulin G (PAlgG) [Bussel et al.,Blood62-2, 480-486
(1983)].ITP is also a common complication of HIV infection [Morris et al.,Ann. Intern. Med.
96, 714-717 (1982)], which can occur at any stage of its natural history, both in patients
diagnosed with the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), those with AIDS-related
complex, and those with HIV infection but without AIDS symptoms.AIDS is a transmissible disease characterized by a profound deficiency of cellular
immune function and the occurrence of opportunistic infection and malignancy. In 1983, a
retrovirus was identified in association with this syndrome [Barre-Sinoussi, F., Chermann,
J.C., Rey, F. et al.,Science220, 868-871 (1983); and Gallo, R.C., Salahuddin, S.Z.,
Popovic, M., et al.,Science 224, 500-503 (1984)]. Subsequently, there have been numerous
isolations of related retroviruses from patients in different geographical areas, and the
etiologic role of this retrovirus has been clearly established. Whereas initially these isolates
were variously referred to as lymphadenopathy associated virus (LAV), human T cell
lymphotropic virus-III
