<ABSTRACT>
The device is intended, for example, for keeping food warm by means of a heater (6) fitted to the base (5) of a recess (1). The device may be fitted with an easily removable pivoted cover. To prevent the electric cable (12) of the heater (6) from hanging down in an unsightly manner and, with the cover open, from lying in the condensate region between the heater (6) and the cover, the electric cable (12) of the heater is led sideways out of the device. To this end, a supporting pin (11) takes the form of a laterally open groove (13) in which the cable (12) is suspended. If the heater (6) is removed so that the recess (1) can be heated, for example, by a hotplate, the cable can easily be detached from the supporting pin (11). The supporting pin (11) may also be used as the pivot for the cover so that, with the cover closed, the laterally open groove (13) of the supporting pin (11) is closed and the cable (12) cannot be removed from the supporting pin (11).
