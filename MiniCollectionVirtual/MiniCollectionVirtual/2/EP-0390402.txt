<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adhesive composition. 
In particular, the present invention relates to 
an α-cyanoacrylate base adhesive composition having good 
storage stability. Since an α-cyanoacrylate base adhesive is a reactive 
adhesive comprising an α-cyanoacrylate monomer, it 
tends to be cured in an adhesive container during storage 
because of radical or anionic polymerization of said monomer. 
Therefore, a polymerization inhibitor is added to the 
adhesive as a stabilizer to improve the storage stability of 
the adhesive. As the radical polymerization inhibitor for the α-cyanoacrylate 
monomer, are used hydroquinone, hydroquinone 
monomethyl ether, catechol, pyrogallol, bisphenol A and the 
like. The polymerization inhibitor is added to the adhesive 
in an amount of 1 to 5000 ppm to inhibit the radical polymerization 
during room temperature storage. The anionic polymerization is initiated with a 
small amount of moisture or a base such as an amine and 
ammonia. To prevent increase of viscosity and gelation due 
to anionic polymerization of the monomer, are used SO₂, SO₃,  
 
SOCl₂, SO₂Cl₂, HF, BF₃, BF₃-ether complexes, NO₂, paratoluenesulfonic 
acid, methanesulfonic acid, propanesultone, 
phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and the like. However, the addition of the anionic polymerization 
inhibitor increases a setting time of the adhesive and 
deteriorates instantaneous adhesivity. Since such inhibitors 
are in a gas state at ambient temperature, their handling 
and adjustment of their concentration in the adhesive 
are difficult. Some of them such as SO₃ and BF₃-ether complexes 
tend to fume and color the adhesive. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
novel anionic polymerization inhibitor which is useful as a 
stabilizer for an α-cyanoacrylate base adhesive. Also, it is desirable to 
provide an α-cyanoacrylate base adhesive composition which 
does not suffer from the drawbacks of the conventional α-cyanoacrylate 
base adhesives. Accordingly, the present invention provides an α-cyanoacrylate 
base adhesive composition comprising 0.0001 to 
0.5 part by weight of borofluoric acid (HBF₄) (as 100 %) per 
100 parts by weight of an α-cyanoacrylate monomer. Specific examples of the α-cyanoacrylate monomer 
which is a main component of the adhesive composition are 
methyl α-cyanoacrylate, ethyl α-cyanoacrylate, propyl α-cyanoacrylate,  
 
allyl α-cyanoacrylate, butyl α-cyanoacrylate, 
heptyl α-cyanoacrylate, hexyl α-cyanoacrylate, octyl 
α-cyanoacrylate, decyl α-cyanoacrylate,
