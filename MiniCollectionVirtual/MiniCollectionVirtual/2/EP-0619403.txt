<ABSTRACT>
An exterior wall construction for buildings or inclined roofs is composed of posts (1) and crossmembers (3, 4) and of filler elements (5) which are enclosed by said posts and crossmembers. A surface seal (14) is arranged in the region of the joint (2) between the crossmember (3, 4) and one side of the post (1). This seal overlaps the butt joint between crossmember pressure profile (10) and post pressure profile (8) and the interspace between the crossmember-side side edges (6) of the filler elements (5) on the pressure-profile-side outer surface (19) thereof. The surface seal (14) exhibits, in its outer sealing surface (16) in the region of overlap by the crossmember pressure profile (10), a sealing attachment (20) which fills the crossmember-pressure-profile inner cross-section, formed by the crossmember pressure profile (10) and its sealing mouldings (13), in a sealing manner towards the post pressure profile (8).

with posts (1) or rafters (101), 
with crossbars or locking bars (3,4) and purlins (103, 104) 
respectively, and 
with filling elements (5) framed by them, made in particular 
of glass, which are inserted between the inner post 

sections (7) and locking bar sections (9), and the 
weatherside pressure post sections (8) and pressure locking 

bar sections (10) joined to them, in which arrangement 

the pressure post sections (8) and the pressure locking bar 
sections (10) bear on the filling elements (5) with their 

longitudinal side edges (12) and inwardly projecting sealing 
strips (13) arranged thereon, and 
in the zone of the joint (2) between one locking bar (3,4) 
and one post side, an areal sealing means (14) is arranged 

covering the butt joint (2) between the pressure locking 
bar section (10) and the pressure post section (8) on the 

one hand, and on the other hand, the gap (18) between the 
side edges (6) of the filling elements (5) on the side of 

the locking bar, on their external surface (19) on the side 
of their pressure section, which areal sealing means is 

acted on by the pressure sections (8, 10), 
 
   characterized in that
 
the areal sealing means (14) has on its external sealing surface 

(16) in the zone covered by the pressure locking bar section 
(10), a sealing attachment (20) which is formed by the pressure 

locking bar section (10) and its sealing strips (13) and fills 
the internal cross-section of the pressure locking bar section 

(10) towards the pressure post section (8) with a sealing 
effect. 
A structure according to claim 1,
 
   characterized in that
 
the sealing attachment (20) bears with resilient prestressing on 

the internal surfaces (21) of the pressure locking bar section  
 

(10) and its sealing strips (13). 
A structure according to claim 1 or 2,
 
   characterized in that
 
the sealing attachment (20) is fitted on the areal sealing means 

(14) in the manner of a sealing pad. 
A structure according to claim 3,
 
   characterized in that
 
the sealing attachment (20) is joined to the areal sealing means 

(14) with a material bond. 
A structure according to claim 3,
 
   characterized in that
 
the sealing attachment (20) is formed integrally with the areal 

sealing means (14). 
A structure according to one or more of the preceding 
claims,
 
   characterized in that
 
the sealing attachment (20) and/or the areal sealing means (14) 

consist of a rubber-resilient material, in particular of a 
plastic material with a closed cell structure. 
A structure according to one or more of the preceding 
claims,
 
   characterized in that
 
the areal sealing means intended for use as an inclined areal 

sealing means (114) is covered in the inclined roof zone or 
pyramid zone on its outside at least partly by a watertight 

areal layer (140). 
A structure according to claim 7,
 
   characterized in that
 
the areal layer (140) consists of a metallic material and is, in 

particular, a high-grade steel sheeting.  
 
A structure according to claim 7 or 8,
 
   characterized in that
 
the areal layer (140) extends over the whole width (141) of the 

areal sealing means (114) extending in the direction of the line 
of the roof slope. 
A structure according to one of claims 7 to 9,
 
   characterized in that
 
the areal layer (140) fits with its side edge (142) beneath the 

sealing attachment (120) and stabilizes its shape thereby. 
A structure according to one or more of the preceding 
claims,
 
   characterized in that
 
the pressure locking bar section (10) is designed in the zone of 

the sealing attachment (20) without a guide crosspiece (23) 
which is removed at this point, if required. 
A structure according to one or more of the preceding 
claims,
 
   characterized in that
