<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a plastic container and an external support frame 
therefor, characterised by the container (1) comprising an outlet (5, 5') having 

a desired set outlet size and by a mounting (3, 4) means adjacent the outlet (5, 
5') for mounting the container with the outlet size set, and by the frame (6) 

comprising a support plate (9) having means adapted to cooperate with the 
mounting means (3, 4) of the container (1) whereby to mount the container with 

the outlet size set.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a container, particularly to a plastic moulded container 
and a frame therefor. Such containers are often used to hold and transport flowable materials such as 
powders, particulate material, granules and the like. To fill and discharge the 
material the containers are mounted at a charging or discharge station. However, 
when being handled, transported or the like, owing to the flexibility of the 
plastic, the concentricity and roundness of the outlet is liable to vary, even if it 
is forced into a ring of a frame at a handling station. The frame itself is 
expensive - some 84' of welding is typically required in a standard frame. It is accordingly an object of the invention to seek to obviate these 
disadvantages. According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a plastic moulded 
container, comprising an extended outlet cut off to a desired size after insertion 
of a template to maintain the desired set outlet size. The template may comprise a ring or hoop. This provides for a method of 
providing a set configuration of outlet. There may be mounting means adapted for mounting the container in a frame so 
that the outlet may be maintained in a desired configuration. This allows for 
transport of the container. The means may comprise an annular ring adjacent the outlet. This can be 
integrally formed with the container.  There may be additional mounting means intermediate the length of the container 
for mounting the container in a frame. This provides for a secure mounting. There may be impressed ribs, particularly arranged in an orthogonal array over 
the surface of the container. This provides for rigidity of the container, and a 
relatively simple moulding operation may be used to incorporate the ribs 
integrally with the container body during manufacture. According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a plastic 
container and an external support frame therefor, the container comprising an 
outlet having a desired set outlet size and a mounting means adjacent the outlet 
for mounting the container with the outlet size set, and the frame comprising a 
support plate having means adapted to cooperate with the mounting means of the 
container whereby to mount the container with the outlet size set. The means of the container may comprise a support ring. The mounting means of the container may comprise a ring integrally moulded 
externally of the outlet and the securing means may comprise self tapping 
securing means inserted through holes formed
