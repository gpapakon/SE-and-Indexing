<ABSTRACT>
A misfire detecting method wherein, when a judgement that an internal 
combustion engine is operated in a special condition in which a load on the 

internal combustion engine suddenly varies is made, the detection of misfire 
is prohibited, to prevent the occurrence of erroneous detection. When a judgement 

that the current time is immediately after an engine has been started is 
made (S3), or when a judgement that the current time is immediately after an 

ignition key has been turned off is made (S4), or when a judgement that a deceleration 
operation of the engine, a speed changing operation of a transmission 

or the rough load running of a vehicle is carried out is made (S5-S7), 
a processor repeatedly performing misfire detecting processes aborts a misfire 

detecting process in the present cycle immediately to avoid the occurrence of 
erroneous detection which is liable to happen when the vehicle runs on a 

rough road and so on.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a misfire detecting 
method, and more particularly, to a misfire detecting method 
capable of preventing erroneous misfire detection which is 
liable to occur when an internal combustion engine is 
operating in a particular condition in which the load on the 
engine can suddenly change or immediately after the ignition 
key of the engine is turned off. If, during operation of an internal combustion engine, 
misfire occurs, or more specifically, combustion fails to be 
effected normally in cylinders, due to fault of a fuel 
injection system or the like, emission characteristics etc. 
of the engine become degraded. Thus, as disclosed in JP-A 
2-30954, 
misfire of the engine is detected based on the value of 
or the rate of change of a quantity that 
represents the rotational speed of the engine and that is 
calculated based on the period corresponding to a 
predetermined crank angle associated with each cylinder of 
the engine. In JP-A 
2-49955, it is stated that, if misfire is 
detected based on a variation in rotation of the internal 
combustion engine, i.e., a deviation of a rotary angular 
velocity of the engine, which is calculated at each ignition 
interval in a manner timed with the combustion stroke of the 
engine, from a rotary angular velocity calculated at the 
time of an immediately preceding ignition, which is used as  
 
a reference angular velocity (criterion value), accidental 
misfire or misfire occurring at a rate of I/several rotations 
may fail to be detected with accuracy. To eliminate the 
drawback, JP-A 2-49955 proposes updating the reference 
angular velocity, i.e., the citerion value, as needed. However, when the internal combustion engine is operating 
in a condition in which the load on the engine can suddenly 
change, for example, when the vehicle is running on a rough 
road, an erroneous misfire detection is likely to be made due 
to variation in the rotation of the output shaft of the 
internal combustion engine. JP-A 3-246 353, on which the preamble ofclaim 1 is based, 
discloses a misfire detecting system in which unevenness of 
the road surface is detected using a vehicle height sensor, 
and a misfire is detected only if a road surface condition 
change value is less than a predetermined threshold. An object of the present invention is to provide a misfire 
detecting method capable of preventing erroneous misfire 
detection which is liable to occur when an internal 
combustion engine is operating in a particular condition in 
which the load
