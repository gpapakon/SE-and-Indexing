<ABSTRACT>
A disc-shaped mixing tool (11) is used to mix liquids and to dissolve gases in liquids. The mixing tool (11) has a knife-sharp peripheral edge and several axial through bores (17), so that a liquid stream in the form of several cyclones (25) occurs upon rotation of the mixing tool (11). The bores (17) are each conically bevelled both on the upper and on the lower sides (13, 15) and are axially rounded off in the region (27) between the bevels in such a way that a radial airfoil profile (21) and, in a peripheral direction between adjacent bores (17), a peripheral airfoil profile (23) each result. Upon flowing through the bores (17) the liquid is spun radially outwards, resulting in tiny cavitation bubbles at the peripheral edge (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a disc-shaped mixing tool according 
to the preamble of claim 1. A mixing tool of this kind is already known from U.S. patent 
no. 40 07 920, Fig. 18. This known mixing tool is 
in the shape of a disc, is rotatable around a central 
axis, and is provided with several axial through bores, 
with one of the two sides of the disc being convex. The 
through bores serve to introduce air adjacent to the upper 
side of the mixing tool into a liquid adjacent to the 
lower side of the mixing tool. The mixing effect of this 
known tool, however, is in need of improvement, since for 
a thorough mixing of liquid and gas the known mixing tool 
must rotate for a relatively long time and a large amount 
of energy is therefore consumed. Another mixing tool of the type given above is the subject 
matter of two older applications EP-A-0 495 506 (priority date 
17.01.91, publication date 22.07.92) and EP-A-0 515 732 (priority date 
25.04.91, publication date 02.12.92). 
The 
mixing tool therein is designed as a discus-like disc and 
has different curvatures on its upper and lower sides. 
The disc itself is caused to rotate by a drive, so that a 
pressure difference between the upper and lower sides 
arises as a result of the Bernoulli effect. As the disc 
has several axial bores, an axial stream created by the  
 
pressure difference occurs between the upper and lower 
sides. The stream flows through the axial bores, so that 
an intensive blending of several fluids can take place as 
a result of the flow from the lower side to the upper 
side. In addition, the known disc is provided with a 
knife-sharp peripheral edge to prevent a flow around the 
disc. At a rotary speed of 3000 to 8000 revolutions per 
minute and a disc diameter of 42 mm the stream is so 
strong that cavitation occurs at the peripheral edge of 
the disc and even gases can be dispersed into the tiniest 
bubbles and dissolved in fluids, whereby the finest foams, 
suspensions and emulsions are produced. Cavitation appearances also occur, for instance, with 
turbine blades or ship propellers. If a liquid is caused 
to flow at a high speed, cavities with strong partial vacuums 
are formed in the liquid. When these cavities implode, 
pressure thrusts are released, which can cause damage 
to turbine blades and ship propellers in the form of 
cavitation erosion or cavitation corrosion. To be sure, the discs according to the above two older 
proposals of the applicant have proved themselves in 
practical application; however, endeavours
