<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a boiler casing in the form of a box, with controller housing (2) arranged frontally at the top, the casing (1) including the burner (B) of the boiler. According to the invention, the boiler casing is designed in such a way that at least that part (4) of the side walls (5) of the casing (1) which is located on the swing-open side (S) of the burner and bounds the burner-accommodating space (3) can be swung down or removed and the controller housing (2) forming the upper front edge (3') of the burner-accommodating space (3) is arranged on the casing (1) such that it can be swung up. The burner (B) can thus be accessed without problems and in a simple way for maintenance work, and without the person carrying out the maintenance being in danger of banging his head.
