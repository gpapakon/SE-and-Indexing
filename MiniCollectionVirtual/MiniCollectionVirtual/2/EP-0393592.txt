<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color toner 
excellent in fixability and anti-offset property. The 
present invention also relates to a process for fixing 
a color toner which is capable of providing fixed 
images of color toner excellent in surface gloss 
characteristic and color tone. Hitherto, fixing devices to be used for a heat 
fixing method generally use a fixing system wherein a 
toner-supporting member such as transfer material (or 
transfer-receiving material) carrying an unfixed toner 
image on its surface is sandwiched between and conveyed 
by a heating roller maintained at a predetermined 
temperature, and a pressing roller which has an elastic 
(or elastomeric) layer and is caused to contact the 
heating roller under pressure. In this type of device, there sometimes occurs 
a so-called "offset phenomenon" such that the unfixed 
toner disposed on a toner-supporting member is attached 
to the heating roller side for heating the toner so as 
to fuse and fix the toner onto the toner-supporting 
member, and the toner attached to the heating roller is 
then transferred to the next toner-supporting member. 
Particularly, in an apparatus for forming full-color 
images, plural species of color toners are fixed at a  
 
relatively high temperature so that they are subjected 
to color mixing in their nearly melted states, unlike 
the case of a mono-color toner fixing step wherein a 
toner is simply softened to be fixed onto a toner-supporting 
member under pressure. Accordingly, the 
offset phenomenon is more liable to occur in such an 
apparatus. In order to prevent the offset phenomenon, a 
method of incorporating a crosslinked resin in a toner 
has generally been used. When such a method is used, 
an anti-offset property is imparted to the toner, but 
the toner deteriorates its heat-fusion property. In 
view of the reproduction of a medium-tone color, the 
presence of the crosslinked resin component is not 
preferred in the case of a color toner wherein plural 
species of color toners are required to be disposed on 
a toner-supporting member in a mixing state and are 
required to be melted on the toner-supporting member. 
Accordingly, in the heat roller fixing method for color 
toner, so-called "high-temperature offset" is generally 
prevented by applying a releasing substance such as 
silicone oil onto the heating roller side. On the other hand, British Patent No. 
1,442,835 discloses a method wherein a releasing 
substance such as polyethylene wax and polypropylene 
wax is added to a toner so
