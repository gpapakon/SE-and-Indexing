<ABSTRACT>
Methods and compositions for producing a mammal capable of expressing an exogenously supplied gene in cells of the airway are disclosed. Lipid carrier-nucleic acid complexes are prepared then delivered via aerosol to the lung airway. The invention provides a direct method for transforming pulmonary cells as a means for treating disorders of the lung as for providing a means for delivering substances systematically following expression in the lung.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and compositions for
producing a transgenic mammal which comprises an exogenously supplied gene in
lung tissue. The gene is supplied by aerosolized delivery, particularly to the
airways and alveoli of the lung.With the advent of molecular cloning techniques, an expanding
array of genes with mutations responsible for important human diseases have been
identified and isolated. To date, attempts to replace absent or mutated genes in
human patients have relied on ex vivo techniques. Ex vivo techniques include, but
are not limited to, transformation of cells in vitro with either naked DNA or DNA
encapsulated in liposomes, followed by introduction into a host organ ("ex vivo"
gene therapy). The criteria for a suitable organ include that the target organ for
implantation is the site of the relevant disease, the disease is easily accessible, that
it can be manipulated in vitro, that it is susceptible to genetic modification
methods and ideally, it should contain either non-replicating cells or cycling stem
cells to perpetuate a genetic correction. It also should be possible to reimplant the
genetically modified cells into the organism in a functional and stable form. A
further requirement for ex vivo gene therapy, if for example a retroviral vector is
used, is that the cells be pre-mitotic; post-mitotic cells are refractory to infection
with retroviral vectors. Exemplary of a target organ which meets the criteria for
in vitro gene transfer is the mammalian bone marrow.There are several drawbacks to ex vivo therapy. For example, if
only differentiated, replicating cells are infected, the newly introduced gene
function will be lost as those cells mature and die. Ex vivo approaches also can be 
used to transfect only a limited number of cells and cannot be used to transfect
cells which are not first removed from the body.Retroviruses, adenoviruses and liposomes have been used in animal
model studies in attempts to increase the efficiency of gene transfer; DNA has
been introduced into animals by intratracheal (IT), intravenous, intraperitoneal,
intramuscular, and intraarterial injection. Expression of introduced genes, either
complexed to cationic vectors or packaged in adenoviral vectors has been
demonstrated in the lungs of rodents after IT instillation. However, IT injection is
invasive and produces a non-uniform distribution of the instilled material; it also is
too invasive to be performed repeatedly in humans. It therefore would be of
interest to develop a non-invasive
