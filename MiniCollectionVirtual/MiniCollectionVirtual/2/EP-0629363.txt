<ABSTRACT>
A separable end stop for concealed slide fasteners 
includes a box (1) which has a guide slot (8) extending in a 

front wall (1b) of the box (1) for receiving and guiding folded 
portions of two stringers (7, 7), and a retaining recess (14) 

formed at an upper open end (1a) of the box (1) for receiving 
therein the whole of a lowernd portion (13) of a slider body 

(12) in such a manner that two opposed front wall portions 
(1b', 1b') extending on opposite sides of the front wall (1b) 

overlap the corresponding wings (17, 17) of the slider body (12). 
Each of the front wall portions (1b', 1b') has an upper end 

extension (16) projecting from the open upper end (1a) the box 
(1) to ensure that the wings (17, 17) of the slider body (12) 

are overlapped with the front wall portions (1b', 1b') of the 
box (1). The box (1) further includes a locking portion (10) 

formed on an interior surface (9) facing a box-pin insertion 
hole (4), and a box pin (2) has first and second locking portions 

(18, 19) on opposite sidewalls thereof, interlockingly engageable 
with the locking portion (10) and a partition wall (6), respectively, 

to assemble the box (1) and the box pin (2). The separable 
end stop thus constructed is able to engage and disengage 

two stringers (7, 7) smoothly and reliably and facilitates the 
sewing attachment between the stringers (7, 7) to an article.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a separable end
stop attached to one end of a fastener chain of a concealed
slide fastener so as to permit complete disengagement and
then reengagement of two stringers while preventing a slider
from leaving the fastener chain.One known separable end stop for concealed slide
fasteners is disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication
No. 48-39366. The disclosed separable end stop includes a
box having at its upper end a recessed step in which a lower
end portion of a slider body is received except a front side
thereof. A front or obverse side of the box is shaped such
that right and left front wall portions of the box come into
contact with two opposed guide flanges of the slider body.Another known separable end stop for concealed
slide fasteners is disclosed in Japanese Utility Model
Publication No. 51-4816, which includes a box and a box pin
integrally formed such that the box pin and an upper end
portion of the peripheral wall of the box jointly form an
L-shaped groove in which a lower end portion of a slider body 
is received except a front side and one lateral side thereof.The known separable end stops are unsatisfactory in
that when the slider body is brought into abutment with the
box, the box receives only a part of the entire periphery of
the lower end portion of the slider body. The slider body thus
received tends to wobble when a separable pin of the separable
end stop is inserted into, or removed from the box through the
slider body to engage or disengage the two stringers. Thus,
smooth engaging and disengaging operation of the separable
end stop can not be achieved. In addition, since the front
wall portions of the box and the guide flanges of the slider
body are only contacted in end to end abutment with each other,
the slider body and the box are likely to separate from one
another during the engaging and disengaging operation of the
separable end stop, This separation not only hinders smooth
engaging and disengaging operation of the separable end stop
but also causes an accidental chain rupture or separation.
Especially in the latter known separable end stop, since the
box and the box pin are already mounted in an assembled or
unitary form on one stringer before the stringer is attached
by sewing to an article such as a garment or the like, the box
is likely to constitute an obstacle during the sewing operation.With the foregoing drawback of the prior art in view, 
it is an object of the present invention to provide a separable
end stop for concealed

<CLAIMS>
A separable end stop for a concealed slide
fastener which includes a pair of stringers (7, 7) and a

slider body (12) movable along opposed inner longitudinal
edges of the stringers (7, 7) for opening and closing the

concealed slide fastener, with folded portions of the respective
stringers (7, 7) guided between two opposed wings (17,

17) of the slider body (12), said separable end stop including
a box (1) and a box pin (2) capable of being mounted on one of the stringers

(7) at one end thereof, and a separable pin (3) capable of being mounted on
the other stringer (7) at one end thereof and insertable in

said box (1) to engage and disengage the two stringers (7, 7),
said box (1) having an open upper end (1a) and including a

front wall (1b) having a guide slot (8) extending from said
open upper end (1a) toward a lower end of said box (1) for

receiving and guiding the folded portion of the two stringers
(7, 7), said front wall (1b) being composed of a pair of

opposed right and left front wall portions (1b', 1b') separated
by said guide slot (8), said box (1)

further having a retaining recess (14) formed at said open upper
end (1a) for receiving therein the whole of a lower end portion

(13) of the slider body (12),
characterized in that

said front wall portions
(1b', 1b') of the box (1) are adapted to overlap the wings (17) of the

slider body (12), respectively. 
A separable end stop according to claim 1,
wherein each of said front wall portions (1b', 1b') of said

box (1) has an upper end extension (16) projecting from said
open upper end (1a) of said box (1).
A separable end stop according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein said box (1) includes a central partition wall (6)

defining within said box (1) a first hole (4) for receiving
therein said box pin (2) and a second hole (5) for receiving

therein said separable pin (3), said box (1) having a locking
portion (10) formed on an interior surface (9) of said

box (1) facing said first hole (4), said box pin (2) having
a first locking portion (18) on one side thereof and a second

locking portion (19) on an opposite side thereof, said first
and second locking portions (18, 19) of said box pin (2) being

interlockingly engageable with said locking portion (10) and
said partition wall (6) of said box (1) to couple said box (1)

and said box pin (2) in an assembled condition.
A separable end stop according to claim 3,
wherein said locking portion (10) of said box (1) is a step

formed on said interior surface (9) and facing away from
said open upper end (1a) of said box (1), and said first and

second locking portions (18, 19) of said box pin (2) are

A separable end stop according to claim 3,
wherein said partition wall (6) which is initially slightly 

tilted toward said second hole side is raised up to an upstanding
position when said box pin (2) is inserted into said
