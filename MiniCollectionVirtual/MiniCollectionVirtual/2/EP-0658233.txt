<ABSTRACT>
An element based wall construction, process of modular construction and apparatus for constructing structures of spaced concrete cylinders (10) and beams (14, 100) and foam insulating blocks (50, 60). The wall construction includes spaced, vertical concrete cylinders (10) interconnected by horizontal concrete beams (14, 100), reinforced by centrally located reinforcing bars (42), with a pilaster (12) projecting inwardly beyond the cylinders (10) and beams (14, 100) to support roof and floor joists or trusses, and insulating foam blocks (50, 60) occupying the spaces between cylinders (10) and beams (14, 100). The process includes the construction of concrete column (10, 300) and beam (14, 100) forming assemblies interspersed with insulated blocks to form a complete wall structure for a building with exposed pilaster channels (200) at each floor and roof level connected to the beam (14, 100) and column (10) defining apertures, stabilizing the structure, and substantially continuously pouring concrete into the channels to create a unitary wall structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Description Element Based Foam and Concrete Modular Wall Construction and Method and Apparatus Therefor Technical FieldThe invention relates to the field of element based modular building construction, using walls made of foam or other inexpensive polymeric insulating material, in or between which concrete vertical and horizontal columns and beams are formed at the construction site. Glossary of TermsAs used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:"Block" or "Insulating Block" means an elongated block of foam insulating material, preferably a polymeric."Channel" means a form in which to pour concrete to define a concrete beam."Code" means the Uniform Building Code and applicable federal, state and local building codes."Joists or Trusses" means wooden I-beams or any other structural components used to support floors or roofs of a structure."Pilaster" means a beam that includes a projecting, substantially coextensive ledge."Rebar" means an elongated reinforcing bar, used for concrete and usually made of steel."Substantially Continuous Pour" means a concrete pour which can be performed substantially continuously until completed, assuming availability of concrete and acceptable working conditions, such as light, temperature. Background ArtMany attempts have been made to develop relatively inexpensive fabrication techniques for avoiding the high skill, labor-intensive traditional methods of constructing homes and small buildings. To the extent that inexpensive materials, which may be assembled relatively quickly by 

unskilled laborers, are feasible, the time required to construct a building and the attendant costs, both for labor and the money invested in land and building materials, can be considerably reduced.The prior art teaches many different ways to attempt to avoid the time-intensive and skilled labor-intensive techniques of building construction which are traditionally used. However, these approaches have achieved only limited success, because they have not sufficiently minimized labor, time and costly materials used in building construction. They have been too slow and too expensive.One of the interesting techniques for constructing relatively inexpensive housing and other buildings is described in U.S. Patent 4,532,745 to Kinard. In that patent, a concrete and polystyrene foam block wall construction is illustrated. Cylindrical, vertically extending apertures are molded or formed in each block. Each course of foam blocks is separated from its vertically proximate
