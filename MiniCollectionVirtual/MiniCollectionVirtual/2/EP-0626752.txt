<ABSTRACT>
A method of controlling a transportation velocity of 
a printhead carriage of a serial printer is disclosed. 

The printhead carriage is driven by a motor via a timing 
belt. Firstly, a characteristic equation, which includes 

a motor speed, a current applied to said motor, an 
equivalent disturbance indicating environmental 

variations affecting said motor speed, is discreted. 
Thereafter, the equivalent disturbance is estimated using 

the characteristic equation which has been discreted. A 
value of the equivalent disturbance, which cancels the 

equivalent disturbance, is determined. Subsequently, a 
value of the equivalent disturbance is calculated using a 

discrete low pass filter. Finally, a current to be 
applied to said motor is obtained by adding a 

compensating level of the controller to the level of said 
equivalent disturbance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
precisely controlling a printhead carriage transportation 
velocity of a serial printer irrespective of 
environmental changes, aging, etc. which adversely 
affects a speed of a motor used for driving the carriage. In order to realize a high quality printing in a 
serial printer, it is vital to precisely control a 
velocity of a printhead which is driven by a motor via a 
timing belt. One known approach to realizing such requirements is 
to constantly detect a motor speed and check to see if a 
motor is driven at a predetermined reference speed. That 
is, the motor speed detected is compared with the 
reference (viz., desired) speed. Thereafter, a 
controller provided in a feedback loop controls the motor 
speed such as to reduce a difference between the 
predetermined reference motor speed and the motor speed 
actually detected. Thus, the motor speed is eventually 
converged to the predetermined speed. By way of example, such a prior art is disclosed in 
Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 63-277487. In 
this prior art, if an actual motor speed is detected 
faster than a predetermined value, a current to be 
applied to the motor is reduced. Contrarily, if the 
motor speed is detected lower than the predetermined 
speed, the motor current is decreased. However, characteristics of a motor and associated 
mechanism for driving a printhead, are subjected to 
environmental changes such as environmental changes 
(viz., ambient temperature changes) and aging of 
printhead driving mechanism.  As is known, serial printing is implemented by 
moving linearly a carriage at a constant speed. 
Therefore, when such environmental changes occur, the 
carriage speed changes and thus, print position errors 
are inevitably induced. In order to overcome such problems, according to 
another prior art disclosed by Japanese Laid-Open Patent 
Application No. 4-164669, the aforesaid aging and 
environmental changes are used as load changes. That is, 
the load changes are estimated. Thereafter, a motor 
driving current is calculated considering the load 
changes which have been obtained experimentally. The latter mentioned prior art techniques 
undesirably require: 
(1) Load changes should previously be estimated by 
conducting experiments; (2) It is required to determine time responses of a 
motor speed when a motor is initially energized; and (3) A memory is required which stores the 
experimental data. Therefore, in order to precisely control the motor 
speed without
