<ABSTRACT>
Positive photoresists formulations for producing positive photoresist images have improved thermal stability yet which allow a wide variation in resin to photoactive sensitizer compound without significant changes in photospeed, thermal behaviour, contrast or resolution and with virtually no less in unexposed areas of the photoresist and without significant outgassing or popping are provided by employing novel 1,2-diazonaphthoquinone-4- or -5-sulfonate esters of 2,3,4,3',4',5'-hexahydroxybenzophenone with a novel isomeric distribution of esters. The novel isomeric distribution of 1,2-diazonaphthoquinone-4- or -5-sulfonate esters of 2,3,4,3',4',5'-hexahydroxybenzophenone is characterized by two major isomers, together comprising at least about 70 % by weight of the photoactive compound, and wherein the least polar isomer comprises only about 40 %.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to formulations and processes
for obtaining positive photoresist images. More
particularly, this invention relates to novel
photosensitizers for use in producing positive
photoresists formulations permitting a wide variation in
resin to photosensitizer ratio without a significant
change in photospeed while producing positive photoresist
images of improved thermal behavior and good contrast and
resolution characteristics. Even more particularly this
invention relates to novel photosensitizers that permit
the production of positive photoresist images requiring
lower photospeed and that can withstand high bake
temperatures.It is well known in the art to produce positive
photoresist formulations from alkali-soluble novolak
resins together with light sensitive materials
(photoactive compounds), usually a substituted
naphthoquinone diazide compound which acts as dissolution
rate inhibitor with respect to the resin, dissolved in an
organic solvent or mixture of solvents. These
photoresist formulations are applied as a thin film or
coating to a substrate suitable for a particular
application. Upon exposure of selected areas of the
coated substrate to actinic radiation, the dissolution
rate inhibitor or photoactive sensitizer causes the
exposed areas of the coating to be more soluble in
developer than the unexposed areas. Conversely, in those 
areas of the coated substrate not exposed to radiation,
the photoactive compound inhibits dissolution of the
photoresist film by the developer. Immersing the exposed
substrate in alkaline developing solution causes the
exposed areas of the photoresist coating to be dissolved
while the unexposed areas are largely unaffected. Thus,
a positive relief pattern is formed on the substrate. A
similar process is used in lithographic printing plates
as well.Among the properties of a photoresist composition
which are important in commercial practice and
application are the following: photospeed of the resist,
development contrast, resist resolution, thermal
stability of the image, process latitude, line width
control, clean development, unexposed film loss and the
like.Of greatly increasing importance is the ability of
such photoresists to reproduce very small dimensions, for
example sub-micron profiles or geometries, for use in
electronic devices or components. Similarly important is
the ability to produce such sub-micron profiles which can
withstand high temperature environments or heat
encountered in the device fabrication sequence. In
processing steps which
