<ABSTRACT>
To impede traffic flow only above a certain threshold speed, there is provided a unit which includes a support surface (15) adapted to carry the weight of a vehicle wheel characterised by means to control the rate of displacement (16) of the support surface when engaged by the wheel. We also propose an assembly of such units, arranged side by side across a traffic lane.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a traffic speed control unit, a traffic speed control 
assembly, and a method of operating a traffic speed control unit. A number of traffic speed control units, and assemblies, 
have been proposed, seeking to avoid the need to allocate 
staff, e.g. policemen, to traffic speed control duties. A 
document such as GB-A-2 079 356 provides an example. Another such known unit is a so-called "sleeping policeman" 
comprising one or more raised portions extending across, 
usually fully across, the "controlled" road; these raised 
portions are of sufficient height to cause noticable 
impacting of a car or other vehicle travelling at more than 
a minimum road speed e.g. 10 kmph. A number of such raised 
road portions are often used, spaced apart one from another 
along the road. One disadvantage of the known arrangement of the traditional 
"sleeping policeman" is that it is constructed of 
conventional road-making materials; thus the road needs to 
be closed to traffic not only whilst the materials are being 
laid but also until those materials have properly "set".  
 Another disadvantage of the known arrangement of "sleeping 
policeman" is the difficulty of preparing it to a 
predetermined height and dimension in the traffic flow 
direction; the height will thus vary in accordance with the 
skill of the person laying the original road surface, and/or 
the skill of the person laying down the "sleeping policeman" 
upon an existing road surface. Drivers meeting a particular 
"sleeping policeman" for the first time have therefore to 
assume that it will provide a severe impact, so that those 
wishing to avoid such an impact need to slow down to a very 
low traverse speed, no matter what the actual height or 
extent (in the traffic flow direction) of the "policeman", 
and this traverse speed may be much lower than necessary, 
slowing the traffic more than is required. Conversely, 
because a "sleeping policeman" is so effective at slowing 
traffic almost to a standstill, it is not suitable for 
inhibiting traverse traffic speeds only below a "medium 
value" e.g. 50 kmph, so that "sleeping policemen" are not 
widely used, if at all, to help reduce to an acceptable 
value the speed of road traffic approaching a dangerous 
corner, or approaching other potential accident zones such 
as a hamlet straddling a major road.  
 We propose a speed control hump suitable for "traffic 
calming", encouraging a steady traffic flow within defined 
speed limits. At or below the design speed the drivers 
should

<CLAIMS>
A traffic speed control unit wherein a first support 
surface (15a,415a,615a) and a second support 

surface (15b,415b,515b,615b) are mounted in a housing 
(100) characterised by mechanical control means 

(16,26; 416,426; 516,526; 616,626) adapted to be 
removably positioned by the first support surface into 

weight transmitting relation with the second support 
surface. 
A traffic speed control unit according to claim 1 
characterised by mechanical drive means (14,414,614) connected with 

the first support surface, the drive means being 
adapted to move the second support surface in a 

direction opposed to, and by a different distance to, 
that of the first support surface. 
A traffic speed control unit according to. claim 1 
characterised by a cover (102) for the housing. 
A traffic speed control unit according to claim 1 
characterised by pivot means (4,404, 604b) for the 

second support surface, said second support surface 
being mounted to pivot on said pivot means alternately 

between an abutment position proud of the housing and 
a non-abutment position.  

 
A traffic speed control unit as claimed in claim 1 
characterised in that the second support surface is 

coupled to a pivotted arm (3), and in that the 
mechanical control means comprises a load transmitting 

surface (26) and a rollable weight transmitting member 
(16), and in that the housing includes a ramp (22), 

the rollable weight transmitting member being arranged 
to be impelled along the ramp (22) into weight 

transmitting relation with the said second support 
surface (15b). 
A traffic speed control unit according to claim 1 
characterised in that the mechanical control means 

comprises a load transmitting surface (426,526,626) 
and a pivotted weight transmitting member 

(416,516,616), said pivotted weight transmitting 
member being pivotable into and out of weight 

transmitting relation with the said second support 
surface (15b). 
A traffic speed control unit according to claim 1 
characterised by a pair of pivotted arms (2,3; 

402,403; 602,603), one of the arms (3,403,603) being 
connected to a part of the mechanical control means 

comprising a load transmitting surface (26,426,526,626) 
engageable with another part of the mechanical control 

means comprising a weight transmitting member 
(16,416,516,616), by the other of the arms (2,402,602)  

 
having a drive surface (14,414,614) engagable with the 

said one of the arms (3,403,603) to pivot said one of 
the arms, by said one or other of the arms (3,403,603) having a 

control surface (12,412,612) engagable with the weight 
transmitting member when said weight transmitting 

member is not engaged by the said load transmitting 
surface, and by said weight transmitting member being 

one of a rollable member (16) and a pivotable member 
(416,516,616). 
A traffic speed control unit as claimed in claim 7 in 
which the housing has a cover (102), and in that a 

rollable member (16) is mounted to roll upon an 
inclined surface (22) into said weight transmitting 

relation with the second support surface (15b), the 
rollable member being closer to the said cover when in 

said relation with the load transmitting surface (26) 
than when engaged with the control surface (12). 
A traffic speed control unit as claimed in any 
previous claim characterised in that further 

mechanical control means are adapted to be removably 
positioned by the second support surface (15b) into 

weight transmitting relation with the first support 
surface (15a) whereby the unit can operate for 

opposite directions of traverse of the unit.  
 
A traffic speed control assembly characterised by a 
plurality of traffic speed control units according to 

any of claims 1-9, arranged side by side across a 
traffic lane, with the support surfaces normally above 

the traffic lane. 
A method of operating a traffic speed control unit 
according to claim 1 characterised in that the said 

mechanical control means (16,516) is moved from said 
weight transmitting relation with the
 second support 
surface under its weight, the amount of said movement 

controlling the permitted degree of displacement of 
the second support surface.
