<ABSTRACT>
Process for treating glass making it possible to promote the adhesiveness of a polymer to the glass. According to the invention this treatment comprises a stage of deposition of the metal oxide (5) and a stage of the deposition of a layer of a soluble chromium salt (10). The invention also proposes a device for making use of this process. The invention relates more particularly to the treatment of the rim of hollow glass objects to enable a cap to adhere.

<CLAIMS>
Method of treating glass intended for the heat-sealing of a 
polymer, characterized in that it consists of a deposition step 

of a metallic oxide film and a deposition step of a film of a 
soluble salt of chromium. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
deposition of the soluble chromium salt is performed by coating. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
soluble chromium salt is chromium nitrate. 
Method according to claim 3, characterized in that the chromium 
nitrate (Cr (NO

, 9 H
2
O) is used in aqueous solution with a 
content lower than 2% and preferably equal to 1.5%. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the deposition of the metallic oxide film is performed 

by pyrolysis in gaseous phase or by sputtering of solutions of 
metallic salts. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the metallic oxide belongs to the group comprising tin 

oxide and titanium oxide. 
Hollow object of glass such as a bottle, pot, treated at least 
on the mouth according to the method described in claims 1 to 6, 

comprising, on the treated part, a film of a soluble chromium 
salt on a film of metallic oxide and ready to be covered, by 

heat-sealing, with a cap comprising at least one polymer film.
