<ABSTRACT>
The insole consists of a thin base plate 1, the surface of which is densely knobbed. Arranged between the knobs are breathing openings 9. Fastened preferably detachably on the base plate 1 are magnet heads 3. In the region of these magnet heads 3, the base plate 1 has a thickening 5. This thickening 5 with a halo-shaped surface 4 is not knobbed. The thickening 5 is raised at least to the level of the tops of the knobs 2. Such an insole, which overall has a thickness of only approximately 3 mm, can be worn in all commercially available shoes and boots. The insole can particularly advantageously also be used in sports shoes.

Sole inlay for shoes, consisting of a base sheet of 
resilient elastic material with a knopped surface and with 

at least one magnetised pressure head (3) connected to the 
sole inlay, characterised in that the base sheet (1) has a 

maximum thickness of up to 1.5 mm in the knopped area and 
the knop height is everywhere equal and is not greater than 

2 mm, the cross-sectional form of the knops (2) being 
approximately conical, and in that a multiplicity of 

breathing holes (9) are formed in the base sheet (1) beside 
the knops (2), whereas in the area around the pressure head 

or heads (3) the base sheet is without knops but is so 
thickened that it here attains approximately the height of 

the surrounding knops (2). 
Sole inlay according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
knop-free area (4) surrounding the pressure head or heads 

(3) is circular and has a diameter of 2-3 cm, preferably 
2.5 cm. 
Sole inlay according to Claim 1, characterized in that each 
knop (2) is surrounded by several breathing boles (9). 
Sole inlay according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
thickness of the base sheet (1) in the knopped area is less 

than one millimetre. 
Sole inlay according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
pressure head or heads (3) is or are connected solidly to 

the sole inlay. 
Sole inlay according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
pressure head or heads (3) is or are connected detachably 

to the base sheet (1). 
Sole inlay according to Claim 6, characterised in that the 
base sheet (1) has pocket-shaped openings (6) and each  

 
pressure head (3) has a widened collar (33) which is 

located in the pocket-shaped opening (6). 
Sole inlay according to claim 7, characterised in that 
cushioning material (8) is fitted into the pocket-shaped 

openings (6) under the pressure head or heads.
