<ABSTRACT>
Galenic compositions can be applied into the skin thanks to novel micro-aggregates as excipients. The object of the invention is to make available for the therapeutical and diagnostic use on the skin or for systemic application pharmacological active substances in a biologically and chemically inert excipient, allowing deeper penetration into the skin or the transcutaneous transport. For that purpose, a galenic composition for topical use contains asymmetrical lamellary aggregates consisting of phospholipids, pharmacological active substances and fluorocarbons or fluorocarbon mixtures, the amount of fluorocarbons lying in a range from 1 to 100 % by weight/volume, in a pharmaceutical excipient appropriate for topical use. The galenic composition is prepared by emulsifying its components and by using it in salves, creams , lotions, pastes, gels, powders or on a plaster or bandage, or in a spray.

<CLAIMS>
Pharmaceutical composition for topical administration 
with phospholipids and fluorocarbons, 

characterised by asymmetric lamellar aggregates, consisting 
of phospholipids having a phosphatidylcholine content 

of 30 to 99 % by weight, pharmacological active compounds 
and fluorocarbons or fluorocarbon mixtures, the amount of 

fluorocarbon being in the range from 1 to 100 % 
weight/volume, in a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for 

topical administration. 
Composition according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the lamellar aggregates have an asymmetric, 

preferably 3-layer, structure originating from their 
fluorocarbon core. 
Composition according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the fluorocarbons are selected from the group 

which consists of aliphatic straight-chain and branched 
fluoroalkanes, mono- or bicyclic optionally fluoroalkyl-substituted 

fluorocycloalkanes, perfluorinated aliphatic 
or bicyclic amines, bis(perfluoroalkyl)ethenes and 

mixtures thereof. 
Composition according to Claim 3, characterised 
in that the fluorocarbons are selected from the group 

which consists of perfluorodecalin, F-butyltetrahydrofuran, 
perfluorotributylamine, perfluorooctyl bromide, 

bis-fluoro(butyl)ethene or C₆-C₉-perfluoroalkanes. 
Composition according to Claims 1, characterised 
in that the amount of fluorocarbons is in the range from 

20 to 100 % weight/volume, preferably in the range from 
40 to 100 %, in particular in the range from 70 to 100 %. 
Composition according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the phospholipids are selected from the group 

consisting of natural phospholipids such as soya lecithin 
and egg lecithin as well as synthetic phospholipids, 

and/or partially hydrogenated phospholipids, in a concentration 
between 0.5 and 20 %.  

 
Composition according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that phosphatidylcholine is present in an amount from 

70 to 90 %. 
Composition according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that in the lipid fraction used, in addition to 

phosphatidylcholine, lysolecithins are present in the 
concentration range from 1 to 5 % by weight. 
Composition according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that as active compounds it contains one or more of 

the following groups, dermatological active compounds, 
systemic active compounds, cytostatics, cancerostatics, 

immunomodulators and vaccines. 
Composition according to Claim 9, characterised 
in that the active compound is a pharmaceutical from the 

group consisting of virustatics or virucidal pharmaceuticals, 
antimycotics, heparins, antibiotics, corticoids, 

antiinfectious agents, acne active compounds, local 
anaesthetics, antiinflammatories, antihistamines or 

antipsoriatic agents. 
Composition according to Claim 9, characterised 
in that the systemic active compound is a pharmaceutical 

from the group consisting of the non-steroidal analgesics/antirheumatics, 
opiate receptor agonists, opiate 

receptor antagonists, heparins, histamine antagonists, 
insulins, regulatory peptides, sedatives or hypnotics. 
Composition according to Claim 9, characterised 
in that the dermatological active compound is rosmarinic 

acid or another virucidal or virustatic active compound 
found in plants. 
Composition according to Claim 11, characterised 
in that the systemic active compound is a low molecular 

weight or high molecular weight heparin, or an oligopeptide 

or polypeptide. 
Process for the preparation of a phospholipidcontaining 
pharmaceutical composition, characterised in 

that phospholipids having a phosphatidylcholine content 
of 30 to 99 % by weight are emulsified with a fluorocarbon 

or fluorocarbon mixture, a pharmacological active 
compound or an active compound combination being incorporated  

 
into the emulsion, and the amount of fluorocarbon 

being in the range from 1 to 100 per cent weight/volume, 
and the asymmetric lamellar aggregates obtained in this 

way being incorporated into an excipient suitable for 
topical administration as active compound carriers having 

a particle size from 50 to 1000 nm. 
Process according to Claim 14, characterised in 
that the amount of fluorocarbons is in the range from 20 

to 100 % by weight/volume, preferably in the range from

ointments, creams, lotions, pastes, gels and powders, if 
appropriate on a dressing or a plaster or as a spray.
