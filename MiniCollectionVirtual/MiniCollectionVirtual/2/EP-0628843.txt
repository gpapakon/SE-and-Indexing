<ABSTRACT>
Optical image transmission systems are described in which all image defects (image errors) can be corrected and which have no lenses which are difficult to centre. They consist of at least two partial systems, at least one partial system having one lens of positive refractive power and one lens of negative refractive power. For the refractive indices it holds true that n(+) 
>
 n(-) and for the focal length that F 
>
 O. Such systems can be used as modular systems for example in endoscope-like devices, the objective and/or the eyepiece not having to be exchanged if the number of such modular systems in the device is changed.

Optical picture transmission system for endoscopes 
or endoscope-like devices having two partial 

systems (A,B) forming the ends of the picture transmission 
system, each partial system having a first 

positive lens cluster and a second lens cluster, the 
first lens cluster having a converging lens with a 

refractive index N+ and a diverging lens with a refractive 
index N-, which in comparison to N+ is smaller, 

characterized in that all optical elements only have 
spherical surfaces (1-14), and in that the second lens 

cluster has a converging lens and at least one diverging 
lens, the converging lens having a smaller refractive 

index than at least one of the diverging lenses of the 
second lens cluster.

Claim 1, characterized in that it has at least one rod 

lens, that is to say a lens whose axial thickness is 
larger than its diameter.

and in that the surface (2, 11; 2, 13) located between 

the two lenses is concave with respect to the outer  
 

surface (1, 12; 1, 14).
