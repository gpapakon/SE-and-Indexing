<ABSTRACT>
In a digital cellular communication system, a cell-site station
transmits a frame containing a fixed number of burst signals each having

stealing flag bits indicating that the frame is a traffic channel (TCH) or a
fast associated control channel (FACCH). A mobile station receives delay-dispersed

burst signals and equalizes their delay-dispersal effects to
produce soft information so that each of the transmitted stealing flag bit is

represented by a multibit value. A channel discriminator provides a total
sum of all the multibit values of the received burst signals and compares

the sum to a threshold value to identify the received frame as a FACCH if
the sum is equal to or greater than the threshold value, or identify it as a

TCH if the sum is smaller than the threshold value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to digital cellular
communications systems, and more specifically to a channel
discrimination technique particularly for use in the European
digital cellular telecommunications system (Groupe Special
Mobile).In the current GSM digital cellular communication system,
speech and data bits from a cell-site base station are carried
on a traffic channel (TCH) frame, and control bits are carried
a fast associated control channel (FACCH) frame which is
created by "stealing" part or whole bits of a TCH frame. To
enable mobile stations to discriminate between TCH and FACCH
frames, stealing flag bits are inserted in predetermined bit
positions of each burst of the FACCH frame. On receiving a
frame, each mobile station initiates an equalizing process to
account for delay-dispersal effects of the transmission path
to produce a single bit sequence, and counts the stealing flag
bits of the frame contained in the bit sequence. The mobile
station then compares the number of stealing flag bits of the
frame to a hard decision threshold and determines that the
frame is a FACCH if that number is equal to or greater than
the threshold; otherwise it determines that the frame is a
TCH. Since the equalized signal is of a sequence of bits of 
single significance each and hence the channel discrimination
is based on hard decision comparison, there is a need to
increase the resolution of the stealing flag bit count to
permit the setting of the threshold to a more precise value.From GB-A-2 260 245, a method for receiving encoded data is
known. However, this solution provides an insufficient
precision of discrimination under varying signal/noise
conditions.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide
an 
improved channel discrimination technique for a communication system
by increasing the resolution of stealing flag bit count by representing each
symbol bit with a plurality of bits of different significances.According to the present invention, a channel discrimination
between a traffic channel frame and a fast associated control channel
frame is made by (a) receiving a frame containing a fixed number of
delay-dispersed burst signals, each burst signal containing information bits
and/or control bits, and at least one stealing flag bit indicating the
presence or absence of the control bits, (b) equalizing delay-dispersal
effects of the burst signals and producing therefrom soft information
representing the stealing flag bit of each burst signal by a multibit value,
(c) summing
