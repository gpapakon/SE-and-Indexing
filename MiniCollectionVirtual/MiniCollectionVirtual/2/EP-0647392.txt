<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a construction for milking 
animals, such as cows, comprising a milking robot (8) for 

automatically connecting teat cups (14; 15; 16; 17) to the 
teats of an animal. When a teat cup (14; 15; 16; 17) gets 

disconnected, whilst the other teat cups (14; 15; 16; 17) are 
still in the connected state, then the disconnected teat cup 

can again be connected without being obstructed by an other 
teat cup (14; 15; 16; 17). For renewed connecting of the 

disconnected teat cup (14; 15; 16; 17), it is not necessary 
to disconnect the other teat cups (14; 15; 16; 17). To render 

this possible, the head (13) of the milking robot (8) 
comprises holders (59) for teat cups (14; 15; 16; 17) which 

are capable of moving downwards. By moving the holder (59) 
downwards after the associated teat cup (14; 15; 16; 17) has 

been connected to a teat, this cup (14; 15; 16; 17) is no 
obstacle during connecting of the adjacent teat cup (14; 15; 

16; 17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a construction for
automatically
milking
animals, according to the preamble of claim 1.Constructions of this type are known from EP-A-0
300 582.The invention has for its object to provide an alternative
construction of the above-described type.According to the invention this is achieved by
the features of the characterizing part of claim 1.According to a feature of the invention at least
two units are pivotal about a substantially vertical shaft.
In accordance with the invention, the construction is further
characterized in that a teat cup, after it has been
disconnected from a relevant teat, can be connected
again without it being necessary that one of the further
teat cups is first disconnected. Thus, when the disconnected
teat cup is connected again, a saving of time is
achieved. Furthermore, the flow of milk from the animal
during renewed connecting of the disconnected teat cup
can continue. In accordance with a still further feature of
the invention, the head end of the milking robot has
holders for teat cups, in which a holder can be moved
downwards, whilst an other holder is arranged such that
it can be moved upwards. By moving a holder down
after an associated teat cup has been connected, the
teat cup holder does not form an obstacle during connecting
of the adjacent teat cup. In accordance with a
further feature of the invention, each of the holders is
arranged such that it can be moved down and towards
the robot head independently of the further holders. In
accordance with a further featureof the invention, the
motion of a holder in the downward direction and
towards the milking robot is so great that this holder
remains outside the reach of associated teat cups which
have already been connected to the teats, even if the
head of the milking robot is moved to a position in which
an other teat cup can be connected to a teat. In accordance
with a still further feature of the invention, the teat
cups are first connected to the rear teats and thereafter
to the front teats, whilst, when thereafter one of the teat
cups is disconnected from a rear teat, the adjacent
holder of the teat cup connected to a front teat can be
moved down so far and towards the milking robot that,
when the relevant teat cup is again connected to the
rear teat, this adjacent holder remains outside the reach
of the relevant teat cap connected to a front teatAccording to the invention, the milking robot
further includes four units, each comprising a holder
including a teat cup and a portion of a milk
