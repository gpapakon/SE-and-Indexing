<ABSTRACT>
The active noise canceling method provides compensation of background noise, preferably between 500 to 800 Hz, using anti-phase noise signals produced within the telephone booth (2). A microphone (4) detects the background noise which is fed to a digital filter to produce a compensation signal to be supplied to loudspeakers (3.1, 3.2). The filter coefficients may be adapted in dependence on the microphone signals. An Independent claim is included for a noise canceling device applying the method of the invention.
