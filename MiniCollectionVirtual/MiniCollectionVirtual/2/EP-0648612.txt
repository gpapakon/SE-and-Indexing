<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reversible
heat-sensitive recording material which permits
formation and erasion of an image by heating.In general, heat-sensitive recording materials
are obtained by forming on a substrate a heat-sensitive
recording layer composed mainly of a usually colorless
or light-colored, electron-donating dye precursor and an
electron-accepting developer. On heating with a thermal
head, a thermal pen, laser beams or the like, the dye
precursor and the developer react with each other in a
moment to give a printed image. The heat-sensitive
recording materials have been disclosed, for example, in
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 43-4160 and 45-14039.When an image is once formed in such a heat-sensitive
recording material, it is generally impossible
to erase the image to restore the heat-sensitive
recording material to the former state in which the
image has not been formed. Therefore, for recording
further infomation, there is no choice but to record the
information in a portion of the heat-sensitive recording
material where an image has not been formed.
Accordingly, when the heat-sensitive recording material
is limited in the area of its heat-sensitive recording
portion, it has been disadvantageous in that the amount
of infomation recorded therein is limited, so that 
recording of the whole of necessary information is
impossible.In recent years, for coping with such a
problem, reversible heat-sensitive recording materials
have been devised which permit repeated image formation
and image erasion. For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Nos. 54-119377, 63-39377 and 63-41186 disclose
heat-sensitive recording materials comprising a resin
matrix and an organic low-molecular weight compound
dispersed therein. But in such a method, the
transparency of the heat-sensitive recording materials
is reversibly changed by heat energy, so that there is
an insufficient contrast between a portion having an
image formed therein and a portion having no image
formed therein.In the methods disclosed in Japanese Patent
Laid-Open Nos. 50-81157 and 50-105555, an image formed
changes with the ambient temperature, so that there is a
different between temperatures at which an image-forming
state and an image-erasing state, respectively, are
maintained. The two states cannot be maintained at
ordinary temperature for an optional period of time.In addition, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 59-120492
discloses a method in which an image-forming
stateand an image-erasing state are maintained by
maintaining a recording
