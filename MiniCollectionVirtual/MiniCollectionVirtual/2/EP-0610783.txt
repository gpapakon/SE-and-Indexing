<ABSTRACT>
Boxed structural components (1) of bodyworks, whether 
linear or annular (underfloor beam, engine support frame 

and the like) are obtained from two or more tubular metal 
members (3, 4) by hydroforming at least one member, 

possibly after bending, so as to provide through openings 
(11, 12) and a connection end (14) provided with an axial 

shoulder (19) adapted to be telescopically inserted on a 
corresponding adjacent end (15) of a further member; the 

tubular members are then connected head to head, in 
abutment against the shoulder, with the interposition of a 

structural adhesive (25) so as to pre-assemble the 
structural component to be obtained, which is mounted on 

the bodywork (2) and is then subject, together with the 
overall bodywork, to a process of deposition of a 

protective substance (27), for instance by cataphoresis, 
carried out such that the protective substance is 

introduced inside the structural component (1) and such 
that any excess substance is removed from the structural 

component via the through openings (11, 12) and such that 
the adhesive (25) is caused to cross-link.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the 
production of boxed structural components for vehicle 
bodyworks, either of linear type, for instance the 
underfloor beam, or of annular type, for instance the 
engine support frame, the underframe for the rear 
suspension, etc. It is known that structural components of the above-mentioned 
type are generally produced from appropriately 
bent and spot-welded metal sheet or, when producing frames 
or underframes, from tubular metal members which are 
appropriately shaped into a ring by bending and whose 
opposite ends, once they have been brought into an adjacent 
position, are joined head to head by welding carried out 
directly between the ends (usually with flux material) or 
via the interposition by superimposition of a sleeve which 
is fitted on one end prior to bending and is then displaced 
axially in order to be fitted on both adjacent ends to 
which it is then welded. The known methods described above have many drawbacks, 
the most substantial of which consists in the 
unsatisfactory strength of the structural components, in 
particular in the connection zones between the sheets or 
the tubular members; the production of components of 
complex shape is also difficult and generally exacerbates 
the problems of connection of the various members of the 
component; lastly, these components are readily subject to 
corrosion, especially at the connection points, since it is 
difficult to protect their interiors from contact with 
corrosive agents (atmosphere, moisture) which may in 
particular penetrate through the points of connection of 
the component to the bodywork. Producing the connection of the members forming the 
structural component by adhesives does not solve the above 
drawbacks, since it makes the connection operation  
 
extremely complex as it is necessary to hold the component 
members together until the adhesive has set and, in 
particular, requires further operations, such as a stage of 
heating of the component to allow the cross-linking of the 
adhesive. The object of the present invention is to obviate the 
above-described drawbacks by a method for the production of 
structural bodywork components, whether linear or annular, 
making it possible to obtain, in a simple manner and with 
reduced manufacturing times, components which may be of 
complex shape and which possess considerable strength and 
are well protected against corrosive agents. The invention relates to a method for the production 
of boxed structural components for

<CLAIMS>
A method for the production of boxed structural 
components (1) for vehicle bodyworks (2), characterized in 

that at least two tubular metal members (3, 4) are 
connected together by the stages of: 


plastic deformation of at least one member (3, 4) 
in order to provide thereon respective through openings 

(11, 12) and a connection end (14) provided with an axial 
shoulder (19) and adapted to be telescopically inserted on 

a corresponding adjacent end (5, 15) of a further member 
(3, 4); 
pre-assembly of the structural component (1) to 
be obtained by mechanically connecting, without fastening, 

the tubular members (3, 4) head to head, in abutment 
against the shoulder (19), interposing a structural 

adhesive (25) between the connected ends; 
mounting of the pre-assembled component (1) on 
the bodywork (2); 
coating of the pre-assembled boxed component (1), 
both internally and externally, with a protective substance 

(27) which is applied in conditions such as simultaneously 
to cause the cross-linking of the adhesive (25) and the 

resultant rigid fastening of the tubular members (3, 4) to 
one another. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the coating stage comprises subjecting the pre-assembled 

component (1), together with the overall bodywork 
(2), to deposition in a bath of protective substance (27) 

by immersion in a tank (28) and in that the immersion and 
subsequent removal from the tank (28) are carried out such 

that the protective substance (27) is introduced inside the 
structural component (1) via a first set of openings (11) 

and is then caused to emerge from the structural component  
 

(1) via a second set of openings (12) provided on the side 
opposite to the first. 
A method as claimed in claim 2, characterized in 
that, during or after the immersion stage, the structural 

component (1) is brought, together with the bodywork (2), 
to a temperature such as to cause the cross-linking and 

resultant fixing of the protective substance (27) in the 
form of a film and simultaneously the cross-linking and 

consequent hardening of the adhesive (25) with the 
resultant stable connection of the tubular members (3, 4) 

to form the structural component (1). 
A method as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that prior to the plastic 

deformation stage, the tubular member (3, 4) is subject to 
a bending stage. 
A method as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the plastic deformation stage 

is obtained by hydroforming, inserting the tubular member 
(3, 4) to be hydroformed in a leak-tight mould (7) and 

introducing a pressurized fluid inside the member (3, 4) to 
be hydroformed. 
A method as claimed in claim 5, characterized in 
that the connection end (14) is obtained by broadening of 

the cross-section of an end section (16) of predetermined 
length of a first tubular member (3) so as to obtain within 

this section a cavity (18) ending in the axial shoulder 
(19) and adapted to receive, substantially without radial 

play and in abutment against the axial shoulder (19), a 
corresponding end (15) of a second tubular member (4) and 

in that the length of this broadened section (16) is such 
as to allow the mechanical disconnection of the tubular 

members (3, 4) solely by axial unthreading from the 
connection end (14). 
A method as claimed in claim 6, characterized in  
 

that the second tubular member (4) is provided, in a 
position immediately adjacent to the end (15) to be 

inserted in the connection end (14) of the first tubular 
member (3), with a section (22) of broadened cross-section 

shaped as a symmetrical mirror image of the connection end 
(14) and adapted to abut against the latter following the 

introduction therein of the end (15) of the second member 
(4). 
A method as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that two tubular members (3, 4) 

are bent to form two respective half-rings, are 
subsequently hydroformed so as to obtain a connection end 

(14) on each and are mutually connected by inserting, after 
deposition of a structural adhesive (25), each connection 

end (14) on a corresponding opposite end (5) of the other 
member so as to form a pre-assembled structural component 

(1) shaped as an annular frame. 
A boxed structural component (1) for a vehicle 
bodywork (2), characterized in that it is produced by the 

method as claimed in one of the preceding claims.
