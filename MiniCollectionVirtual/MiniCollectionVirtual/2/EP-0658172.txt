<ABSTRACT>
Alkoxy group-containing copolymers made of (a) 1 to 99 % by weight water-soluble, ethylenically unsaturated, acid groups-containing monomers, (b) 1 to 50 % by weight monomers with a polyalkoxy sequence and (c) to 60 % by weight water-soluble monomers capable of being copolymerized with (a) and (b) are disclosed, as well as the use of these copolymers to retan leathers tanned with mineral or combined substances. The leathers treated with said retanning substances are characterized in particular by an improved fullness and a resistant grain. The acid groups of the monomers (a) are preferably carboxyl groups.

<CLAIMS>
A process for retanning leathers that have been tanned by a mineral or combined method,

characterized in that
 the leathers are treated with 0.02 to 10%, preferably 0.1 to 7.5%, most
preferably 0.4 to 5%-wt., relative to the shaved weight of the leathers, of polymers prepared by

polymerization of

a) 1 to 99%-wt., preferably 30 to 95%-wt. of water-soluble, ethylenically unsaturated, acid
groups-containing monomers and/or unsaturated dicarboxylic acid anhydrides,
b) 1 to 50%-wt., preferably 5 to 35%-wt. of an ethylenically unsaturated, mono- or multiply alkoxylated
monomer of the general formula (1):

 the monomer of group b) is selected
from the group of oxaalkylated allyl alcohol, vinyl alcohol or oxaalkylated butene diol, or an

alkoxy adduct of methacrylic acid.
