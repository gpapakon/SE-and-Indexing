<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluorine-containing 
polymers and their preparation and use. In another 
aspect, this invention relates to methods of free-radical 
polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated 
monomers in the presence of chain-transfer agents, and 
to the resulting polymers and shaped articles thereof. Fluorine-containing polymers, or fluoropolymers, 
with a carbon-carbon backbone chain are an important 
class of polymers and include for example, 
fluoroelastomers and fluoroplastics. Within this class 
are polymers of high thermal-stability and concurrent 
usefulness at high temperatures, and extreme toughness 
and flexibility at very low temperatures. Many of 
these polymers are almost totally insoluble in a wide 
variety of organic solvents, and are chemically inert. 
Some have extremely low dielectric loss and high 
dielectric-strength, and most have unique nonadhesive 
and low-friction properties. F.W. Billmeyer, Textbook 
of Polymer Science, 3rd ed., pp 398-403, John Wiley & 
Sons, New York (1984). Fluoroelastomers, particularly the copolymers of 
vinylidene fluoride with other ethylenically 
unsaturated halogenated monomers, such as 
hexafluoropropene, have particular utility in high 
temperature applications, such as seals, gaskets, and 
linings - see, for example, Brullo, R.A., 
"Fluoroelastomer Rubber for Automotive Applications," 
Automotive Elastomer & Design, June 1985, 
"Fluoroelastomer Seal Up Automotive Future," Materials 
Engineering, October 1988, and "Fluorinated 
Elastomers," Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia of ChemicalTechnology, Vol. 8, pp. 500-515 (3rd ed., John Wiley & 
Sons, 1979). Fluoroplastics, particularly 
polychlorotrifluoroethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, 
copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and 
hexafluoropropylene, and poly(vinylidene fluoride), 
have numerous electrical, mechanical, and chemical 
applications. Fluoroplastics are useful, for example, 
in wire, electrical components, seals, solid and lined 
pipes, and pyroelectric detectors. 
Polychlorotrifluoroethylene is compatible with liquid 
oxygen, and remains tough at cryogenic temperatures. 
See, for example, "Organic Fluorine Compounds," Kirk-Othmer, 
Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Vol. 11, 
pp. 20, 21, 32, 33, 40, 41, 48, 50, 52, 62, 70, 71, 
John Wiley & Sons, (1980). Fluorine-containing polymers can be prepared by 
free-radical initiated polymerization of one or more 
fluorine-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomers. 
Free radicals are typically formed by the decomposition 
of a free-radical
