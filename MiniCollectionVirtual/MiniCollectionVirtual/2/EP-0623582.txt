<ABSTRACT>
Described is a process for the preparation of esters of carboxylic acids from carboxylic acid halides or carboxylic anhydrides and alcohols, which process is catalysed by "onium" or metal salts of carboxylic acids. The process, which is technically simple, gives high yields of anhydrous products. The process is particularly suitable for the preparation of esters of trifluoroacetic acid and chlorodifluoroacetic acid.

<CLAIMS>
Process for preparing carboxylic esters from

used.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the reaction is carried out without addition of

carboxylic acid.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that a carboxylic acid chloride is

used.

substituted by at least 1 halogen atom and having from

1 to 6 carbon atoms; phenyl, tolyl; phenyl or tolyl
substituted by at least 1 halogen atom.
Process according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that an alcohol of the formula

 is alkyl
or alkenyl having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; alkyl or

alkenyl substituted by at least 1 halogen atom and
having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; phenyl; phenyl

substituted by at least one halogen atom and/or by at
least one nitro group. 
Process according to Claim 6, characterized
in that R

solvent.
Process according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the molar ratio of acid

chloride or acid bromide to alkali metal or "onium"
salt lies in the range from 1:1 to 20,000:1.
Process according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the acid chloride or acid

bromide and the alkali metal or "onium" salt is
generated in situ by the reaction of the corresponding

alkali metal or "onium" chloride or bromide and the
anhydride of the carboxylic acid.
