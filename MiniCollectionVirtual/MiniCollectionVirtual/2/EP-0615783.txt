A protector (safeguard), suitable in particular for a heating bath (2) for rotary evaporators, includes a protective hood (20) at least partially covering the heating bath. This protective hood is made in at least two pieces and includes an at least partially transparent visor (22) arranged at the front on the heating bath and a covering part (24) which can be lifted off and/or swung away from the heating bath. Between the visor and covering part at least one intermediate space (32) is formed along one or more sections, so that the visor is force-ventilated when the heating bath is operated.
