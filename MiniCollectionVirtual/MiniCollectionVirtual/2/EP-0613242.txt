<ABSTRACT>
A self-configurable, dual bridge, power amplifier 
has a window comparator sensing the level of input 

signals fed to the amplifier which drives a plurality 
of configuring switches capable of configuring the 

amplifier as a single bridge amplifier driving a first 
and a second loads connected in series or as two 

distinct bridge amplifiers each driving one of the two 
loads. As long as the two levels of the input signals 

remain comprised between a range defined by a negative 
voltage reference and a positive voltage reference, the 

amplifier is configured as a single bridge driving the 
two loads in series, thus reducing sensibly power 

dissipation. 
Several embodiments of the configuring means are 
shown.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a self-configurable, 
dual bridge, power amplifier having a 
considerably reduced consumption as compared with a 
dual bridge amplifier of a conventional type, for the 
same output power rating. Examples of related prior art are disclosed in US-A-4 494 077, in FR-A-2 452 854 and in US-A-3 944 941. In many applications and particularly in audio 
equipments, the low frequency, power amplifiers that 
drive the loudspeakers very often have a so-called 
bridge configuration. When employing integrated amplifiers 
in such a configuration, it is possible to 
achieve an output power rating of about 20W as compared 
to an output power of about 5W that could be obtained 
by the same integrated amplifiers in a single-ended 
configuration. On the other hand, the output power stages of car 
radios or of comparable audio systems often have four 
"channels": right-front, left-front, right-rear and 
left-rear, in order to permit a uniform sound diffusion 
in the compartment by adjusting attenuation on the 
different channels. Four, 20W, power amplifiers imply a maximum power 
dissipation which may be about 4x12=48W. Because of a 
required compactness of car radio and similar audio 
systems, such a power can hardly be dissipated if not 
on account of a relatively high internal temperature of 
the apparatus. On the other hand, a high working 
temperature may be detrimental for the magnetic tape of 
a cassette or for an optical compact disk (CD), the 
drives of which are often installed inside a single  
 
cabinet of the audio apparatus. From the above considerations, it is clear that 
there is a need or utility for a bridge amplifier 
having a substantially reduced dissipation for a 
certain maximum power that can be delivered to multiple 
external loads. The above noted technical problems are substantially 
overcome by the circuit object of the present invention 
based on a dual bridge amplifier composed of four 
operational power amplifiers, which are connectable in 
either a first or a second configuration and as it is defined in Claim 1 and in the correspondant method-Claim 8. In a first 
configuration the functional circuit is equivalent to 
that of a single bridge amplifier driving a load equivalent 
to a first and to a second load, connected in 
series. In a second configuration, the circuit is functionally 
equivalent to that of two distinct bridge 
amplifiers, each driving one and the other, respectively, 
of said first and second loads. A window comparator, 
that is a comparator
