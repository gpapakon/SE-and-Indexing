<ABSTRACT>
The flotation method for separating off solids from a suspension takes place utilizing centrifugal forces. In the clarifying compartment (1), the suspension is set in rotation so that flotated portions are particularly effectively conducted towards the centre of the clarifying compartment (1) and concentrated. Viewed axially, flotated portions and the remainder of the suspension are conducted in the same direction and led off from the clarifying compartment. This flow guidance is advantageous to achieve a good separation effect particularly owing to the vortex avoided as a result. In addition, a plurality of apparatuses for carrying out the method are described.

A method for separating off solids from a
suspension by flotation in a substantially cylindrical

clarification chamber (1), the suspension during the
flotation performing a rotational movement (3) on which

an additional movement (4) is superposed which extends
substantially in one direction of the axis of rotation

(5), the floated contents moving radially inwards and
furthermore substantially likewise in the direction of

the axis of rotation (5) and the discharge of the
suspension (11) from the clarification chamber (1)

being effected tangentially,

characterised in that the suspension rotates during the
flotation inside the cylindrical clarification chamber

(1), without being carried radially inwards.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that microturbulences are produced in the suspension

(2) which is supplied, as is known per se, close to the
inlet into the clarification chamber (1).
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the inflow of the suspension (2) is effected

tangentially.
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that air (9) required for flotation reaches the

clarification chamber (1) together with the suspension.
A method according to Claims 2 and 4,
characterised in that air (9) required for flotation is

admixed in the region of the microturbulences. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that air (9') required for flotation is added to the

suspension in the clarification chamber (1).
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that the suspension to be floated (2) contains

dissolved air, and air bubbles required for flotation
are produced by a pressure drop in the suspension.
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that floated contents are removed from the

clarification chamber in a plurality of fractions (21,
22).
A method according to Claim 8, characterised in
that one fraction (22) contains substances which are

separated off in a subsequent process step.
A flotation apparatus for performing the method
according to one of the preceding claims, having a

substantially rotationally symmetrical flotation vessel
(12, 12') which is vertical in operation, at least one

tangential inlet (13) for the suspension which is to be
supplied, means (16, 17, 18, 19) for producing and

distributing air bubbles, at least one tangential
outlet (14) for the suspension which is to be removed

and also at least one foam pipe (15, 15') in the
central region of the flotation vessel (12, 12') for

the floated contents which, viewed axially, is located
on the side of the flotation vessel (12, 12') on which

the outlet (14) is also located,

characterised in that the flotation vessel (12, 12') is
free of radially extending intermediate walls between

the inlet (13) and outlet (14). 
A flotation apparatus according to Claim 10,
characterised in that the 
flotation vessel (12, 12') is
cylindrical.
A flotation apparatus according to Claim 10,
characterized in that the flotation vessel (12, 12')

tapers towards the outlet.
A flotation apparatus according to one of Claims
10 to 12, characterised in that a turbulence generator

(17) is located in the region of the inlet (13).
A flotation apparatus according to Claim 13,
characterized in that the turbulence generator (17) is

a step diffusor which widens discontinuously.
A flotation apparatus according to Claim 13 or 14,
characterized in that air required for flotation can be

supplied to the turbulence generator (17).
A flotation apparatus according to one of Claims
10 to 15, characterized in that air required for

flotation can be introduced from an air box (18)
radially into the flotation vessel (12, 12') through a

permeable wall section (20) thereof.
A flotation apparatus according to one of Claims
10 to 16, characterized in that air bubbles required

for flotation can be generated with the aid of a choke
located before or in the inlet (13) by reducing

pressure in the suspension.
A flotation apparatus according to one of Claims
10 to 16, characterized in that the ratio of the

maximum internal diameter of the foam pipe (15, 15') to
the maximum internal diameter of the flotation vessel

(12, 12') is greater than 0.6. 
A flotation apparatus according to one of Claims
10 to 18, characterized in that the foam pipe (15') has

a plurality of, in particular two, concentric pipes
which substantially coincide axially, so that a

plurality of, in particular two, different fractions
with floated pulp can be discharged.
A flotation apparatus according to Claim 19,
characterized in that a tangential outlet consists of

at least one, in particular the radially outer one, of
the spaces formed by the concentric pipes.
