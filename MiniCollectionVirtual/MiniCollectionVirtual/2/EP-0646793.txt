<ABSTRACT>
Cell lines which lack human class II histocompatibility 
antig
ens are disclosed. The cell lines may 
be utilized within a method for propagating microorganisms, 

such as viruses, for determining the presence 
and/or amount of antibody to a microorganism in a 

biological fluid, and within a method for producing 
antibodies to a selected microorganism.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally tu human cell 
lines suitable for propagation of microorganisms such as 
viruses, and more particularly, to such cell lines which 
lack human class II histocompatibility antigens. Viruses have been shown to cause a growing 
number of clinically significant human diseases. These 
include influenza virus, the herpes viruses (herpes 
simplex virus type I and type II (HSV-I and -II), 
cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and 
Varicella zoster (VZ)), hepatitis B virus (HBV), 
adenovirus, rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, 
polio virus, and measles virus. Human retroviruses ar now also known, the first 
of these having been obtained from a patient with 
cutaneous T cell lymphoma (Poiesz et al., PNAS77:7415, 
1980) and named Human T Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma Virus 
type I (HTLV I). Subsequently, a second human retrovirus, 
designated HTLV II, was isolated from a T cell 
variant of hairy cell leukemia (Kalyanaraman et al. 
Science218:571, 1982). More recently the etiologic 
agent of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) has 
been shown to be a retrovirus, variously designated 
Lymphadenopathy Associated Virus (LAV ; Barr√©-Sinoussi 
et al., Science220:868, 1983), Human T-Cell Lymphotropic 
Virus III ; Popovic et al., Science224:497, 
1984), or AIDS Related Virus (ARV ; Levy et al., Science225:840, 
1984). There is also evidence that non-A non-B 
hepatitis (NANB) may be caused by a retrovirus (Seto et  
 
al., Lancetii:941, 1984 ; Iwarson et al., J. Med. 
Virol.16:37, 1985). Laboratory diagnosis of a viral infection can 
involve either detection of the virus itself or its 
components, or detection of the host's immune response 
to the virus (serologic detection). Depending upon the 
nature of the virus, detection of the virus itself or 
its components, by culture or by direct diagnosis, may 
be difficult or impossible. For example, although 
retroviruses cause persistent infections in animals, 
including man, retroviral antigens are not always 
readily detectable in the infected animal (Zagury et 
al., Science226:449, 1984). For such viruses, serologic 
detection may be preferable to direct detection. Serologic diagnosis of a viral infection 
requires a source of viral protein with which patient 
sera can be reacted to determine the presence or amount 
of antibody to the viral agent of interest. Typically, 
the virus is grown in a human cell line from which it 
can be purified by methods well known in the art. Many 
viruses, including the Herpes viruses, polio
