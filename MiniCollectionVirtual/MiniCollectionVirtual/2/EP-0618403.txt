<ABSTRACT>
A configuration of evaporator vessel and electrode arrangement is proposed which permits the provision of a wide spectrum of different types of equipment by means of a small number of different components in a variable composition. For this purpose, provision is made in the wall of the evaporator vessel (2, 6, 10) for an arrangement of a plurality of penetrations (bushings) (16.1, 16.2) in which electrodes (20) can be held by means of a plug-in part (18). The plug-in part (18) is provided with an automatic latching device (38, 40) which retains it, after simple plugging-in, in one of the penetrations (16.1, 16.2) and which can be detached again, if required, in order to remove the plug-in part by hand. Depending on the desired design of the electrode-type evaporator, it is thus possible in a simple way to mount electrodes at different positions and in different orientations. Furthermore, it is proposed to include in the electrode arrangement a dummy electrode, which is not connected electrically or is connected to a neutral conductor. By using such a dummy electrode, it is possible, in addition, to control the variation of electric field in such a way that the other (active) electrodes require less adaptation, or none at all to different equipment designs.
