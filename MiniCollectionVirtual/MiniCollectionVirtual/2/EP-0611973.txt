<ABSTRACT>
Such an optical fibre comprises elementary guides (G1 to G4) and a matrix (M) in which they are located. These elementary guides are placed in a very precise way with respect to each other in the matrix and with respect to the external contours (5) of the latter and have high-precision geometrical characteristics. According to the process, preforms are manufactured and machined (ground) with high precision so as to obtain, after assembly, the geometrical pattern chosen for the multicore guide, they are assembled according to this pattern and are welded by means of a drawing initiator, and the assembly is drawn.

Multicore optical guide comprising:

a plurality of elementary optical guides (G1 to G4), whose axes (X1 to X4; X)
are parallel and which in each case have a core (c1 to c4) and an optical

 said matrix is defined by adjacent portions of
cylinders and in that the elementary optical guides (G1 to G4) are positioned
