<DESCRIPTION>
 HYBRID SIV/HIV-1 VIRAL VECTORS AND MONKEY MODEL FOR AIDS .The present invention is directed to a vector comprising a hybrid SIV/HIV genome. This vector can be used to establish an animal model for studying the HIV-1 virus.Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and, to a lesser extent, human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) are etiologic agents of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans [Barre-Sinoussi, F. , et al.. Science 120:868-871 (1983); Gallo .C., et al.. Science 224.500-503 (1984); Clavel, F. , et al., AIDS 1:135-140 (1987)]. These viruses are related to simian immunodeficiency viruses that infect feral populations of sooty mangabeys, African green monkeys, and mandrills [Desrosiers, R.C., et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol. jB:557-558 (1990)]. A simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) capable of infecting and inducing an AIDS-like disease in macaques is closely related to HIV-2 and SIVsmτn [Letvin N.L., et al.. Science 230:71-73 (1985); Daniel M.D., et al.. Science 228:1201-1204 (1985)].The primate immunodeficiency viruses establish persistent infections in their hosts even in the face of an antiviral immune response. Part of this ability may reside in the capacity of these viruses to tightly regulate 

expression of the viral proteins, as evidenced by the presence of four conserved regulatory genes in all members of this group of retroviruses.In addition to the gag, pro, pol and env genes typical of retroviruses, these viruses contain vif. tat, rev, and nef genes [Haseltine W. , et al., Raven Press (1990)]. The tat protein stimulates the viral LTR to express viral RNA [Arya S., et al., Science 229:69-73 (1985); Sodroski J., et al., Science 229:74-77 (1985)] while the rev protein promotes the nuclear egress of viral messenger RNA's encoding the structural gene products [Emerman M. , et al., Cell 57:1155-1165 (1989); Malim M. , et al. , Nature 138:254-257 (1989)]. Both tat and rev genes are essential for viral replication [Dayton A., et al., Cell 44:941-947 (1986); Fisher A.G., et al., Nature 320:367-371 (1986); Sodroski J., et al., Nature 321:412-417 (1986)]. The vif and nef genes, although dispensable for virus replication in some tissue culture settings, are well-conserved [Sodroski J., et al., Science 231:1549-1553 (1986); Fisher A.G., et al., Science 237:888-893 (1987); Strebel K. , et al., Nature 328:728-730 (1987); Kestler H.W. , et al., Cell 6J5:651-662 (1991)]. Depending upon the particular primate immunodeficiency virus, vpx. vpr and/or vpu genes are present in the
