<ABSTRACT>
Device at drivers compartments at lifting trucks including 
steering wheel (20) for control of travel direction and different 

control means (21) for controlling the lifting device (13) of the 
truck. The steering wheel and the control means are arranged on 

a common control panel (25). This is carried by a movable support 
arm (26) that is adjustable to different positions for adaption 

to different drivers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns an arrangement at the drivers compartment
at lifting trucks including a steering wheel for the controlling
of the travel direction and different control means for the controlling
of the lifting device of the truck.Lifting Trucks are frequently used during long work shifts in an
environment that is arduous for the driver through time strain,
noise, cold, heat and high demands on accuracy etc. For
industrial trucks intended for indoor material handling the
complication is added that the driver normally sits in a driving
seat directed perpendicularly in relation to the common
longitudinal and traveling direction. In order to avoid load and
wear injuries of the drivers great efforts have been made to
improve the sitting position and the accessibility for different
control means. Thus the steering wheel is frequently supported on
a console that can be moved from or towards the driver and there
are further different supports for arms and elbows. Hitherto
known trucks however have stationary control means for the
controlling of the lifting device etc while steering wheel and
drivers seat normally are adjustable. This means that the
localization of the control means must be done according to some
chosen normal value while the steering wheel can be adjusted
individually for each driver. The control means will therefor be
placed too far away for a short driver and too close for a big
one. This influences not only the ergonomics but also the driving
safety in particular in situations where precision and swiftness
is required.From EP-A- 0 555 025 (applno. 93300680.1) a truck with pivoting arm
rests is known. The operator travels up with the forks and their
load gripping two control handles which also serve as support,
particularly if the operator is standing up. Even if the armrests
are pivotable the position of the operator will be very much the
same at all times when manoeuvreing is executed. If the operator
did not have considerable much of other activities (picking goods 
for instance) this would lead to worn muscles and joints. For
this particular truck the handles are presumably very good also
in a way securing that the operator has the right position when
lifting and lowering himself. For other types of trucks that are
driven around more like cars or where the driver always remain at
the ground level the pivotable armrests with their manoeuvreing
handles would instead lock a drivers position too much resulting
in worn hands, arms and shoulders and also increased strain on
the neck

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement at the drivers seat or compartment in lifting
trucks including a steering wheel (20) for control of the travel

direction and different control means (21) for controlling the
lifting means (13) of the truck 
characterized in
 that the
steering wheel and the control means are arranged on a common

control panel (25) and that this is carried by a movable arm (26)
that is adjustable in different positions for adaption to

different drivers and that the control panel (25) is an elongate
body with an upper side (27) and a lower side (28) and that the

steering wheel is mounted on the upper side of one end (29) of
the body.
Arrangement according claim 1 
characterized in
 that the
control panel (25) is arranged essentially perpendicular to the

sitting direction of the driver.
Arrangement according to claim 1 or 2 
characterized in
 that
the control means (21) includes a number of control sticks (31,

34) intended for manoeuvering by the drivers fingers.
Arrangement according to any of the preceding claims

characterized in
 that the control means 21 includes a laterally
slidable plate (30) intended for manoeuvering by the palm of one

of the drivers hands or a thumb.
Arrangement according to claim 4 
characterized in
 that the
plate (30) is arranged on the upper side (27) of the control

panel and is slidable in its lengthwise direction and that the
control sticks are arranged in front of the plate so that the

driver with one of his hands or the thumb can manoeuver the plate
as well as a number of control sticks at the same time.
Arrangement according to any of the preceding claims

characterized in
 that the support arm (26) has a first end that
is carried on a slide device (35) in the body of the truck and an 

other end fastened in the control panel (25).
Arrangement according to any of the preceding claims

characterized in
 that the support arm (26) is pivotable relative
the slide device (35) and that the control panel (25) is

pivotable in the same plane in relation to the support arm.
Arrangement according to any of the preceding claims the
drivers compartment including a cabin with a seat (19) directed

essentially perpendicular to the length direction of the truck
and located at a cabin wall (17) towards the mast 
characterized
in
 the slide device (35) being contained in said cabin wall (17)
and the support arm being arranged to run along and close to the

cabin wall and that the control panel (25) protrudes with at
least half of its length essentially perpendicular from the wall.
Arrangement according to any of the preceding claims

characterized in
 that an elbow support (43) is arranged on the
cabin wall which includes a support cushion (44) pivotable

around a vertical (45) axle so that one arm of the driver can at
the same time rest on the support cushion and the control panel

(25).
Arrangement according to any of the preceding claims

characterized in
 that the width of the panel (length of the panel
body) corresponds to the width of the driver.
Arrangement according to any of the preceding claims

characterized in
 that the support arm for the control panel is
telescopic or extendable.
