<ABSTRACT>
For the purposes of structuring, long programs can be subdivided into main chapters and sub-chapters. The skilled worker can orient himself in the chapter overview and thus rapidly finds the various program parts. For this purpose, an NC-control system (numerical control system) according to the figure can be used.

Method of creating, modifying or processing an NC 
program of a numerical control system, in which a sequence 

of NC sets of this NC program is displayed on a screen 
(5), and a plurality of successive NC sets are combined 

into a group and, within this group, a plurality of 
respective successive NC sets are combined into a subgroup, 

and a special NC set is displayed prefixed to each 
of these groups and sub-groups as a subdivision point, 

said special NC set containing an explanatory commentary 
as a headline. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that a 
plurality of groups of NC sets form the entire NC program, 

and in that a special NC set is displayed, prefixed to all 
groups, said special NC set containing an explanatory 

commentary identifying the NC program. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that each 
subdivision point contains an identifier which identifies 

the hierarchical plane of the subdivision point. 
Method according to claim 3, characterised in that, in 
dependence on this identifier, the hierarchical 

relationships between the subdivision points are converted 
into a graphical configuration, prefixed subdivision  

 
points of differing hierarchy being displayed 

distinguishably from one another. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that at least one area of the NC program 

is displayed in a first window (52) of the screen (5) as a 
sequence of NC sets with the associated subdivision 

points, and the sequence of a plurality of subdivision 
points is simultaneously displayed in a second window (5b) 

of the screen (5). 
Method according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
subdivision points of the groups of the subdivision points 

of the sub-groups are displayed as distinguishable by 
differing combinations of the headlines on the screen (5). 
Method according to claim 5, characterised in that one 
from the sequence of subdivision points displayed in the 

second window (5b) is selectable by the user, whereupon 
the NC sets subordinated to this subdivision point are 

displayed in the first window (5a).
