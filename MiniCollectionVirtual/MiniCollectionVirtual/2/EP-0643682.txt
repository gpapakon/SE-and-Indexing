<DESCRIPTION>
 Processes and Intermediates for the Preparation of 2-Substituted BenzaldehydesField of the InventionThis invention relates to novel intermediates and processes for preparing useful intermediates in the synthesis of pharmaceutically active agents.Background2-Substituted benzaldehydes are useful intermediates for preparing pharmaceuticall active compounds. For example, certain compounds which are leukotriene antagonists an useful in the treatment of asthma may be prepared from 2-substituted benzaldehydes of the general formula (la):
 wherein:Rx is (L)a-(CH2)b-(T)c-M; a is 0 or 1; b is 3 to 14; 

 c is 0 or 1;J and T are independently sulfur, oxygen, or CΑ andMis Cι_4alkyl, ethynyl, trifluoromethyl, isopropenyl, furanyl, thienyl, cyclohexyl or phenyl optionally mono substituted with Br, Cl, CF3, Cι_4alkyl, Cι-4alkoxy, methylthio, or trifluoromethylthio;R2 and A are independently selected from H, CF3, Ci^alkyl, Cι_4alkoxy, F, Cl, Br, I, OH, NO2orNH2; or Ri and A are H and R2 is (L)a-(CH2)b-Cr)c-M wherein a, b, c, L, T, and M are as defined above. Such compounds are disclosed, for instance in U.S. Patent 4,820,719, U.S. Patent4,874,792 and EP-A 0296732, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Ac∞πlingly, two general methods for preparing the 2-substituted benzaldehydes are reported therein: 1) palladium catalyzed addition of a substituted 1- alkynyl compound to a 2-halo benzaldehyde effects a coupling to provide a 2-(l- alkynyl)benzaldehyde directly, and 2) a 2-methoxy-benzoic acid may be converted to2-(2-methoxy-phenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-oxazoline and treated with an alkyl or aralkyl Grignard reagent to prepare the corresponding 2-(2-alkyl phenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-oxazoline or 2-(2- aralkyl phenyl 4,4-dimethyl-oxazoline (subsequent treatment of the 2-substituted oxazoline with methyl iodide, reduction with sodium borohydride and subsequent acid hydrolysis produces the corresponding 2-substituted benzaldehyde). The latter method is based upon methods disclosed by Meyers era/., J. Org. Ch m., 43, 1372' (1978). Similar methods for preparing 2-substituted benzaldehydes are disclosed by Perchonock etal., J. Med. Chem., 28, 1145 (1985). In general, these methods employ reagents which functionally displace substituents upon the aryl ring. Methods for adding an ortho substituent to an aryl ring by rendering the aryl ring nucleophilic are also known. Org. Reactions, 26, 43-61 (1979) discloses that certain functional groups which contain nitrogen heteroatoms and are attached to phenyl rings can
