<ABSTRACT>
A fax gateway (10) improves the efficiency of long-distance fax 
communications by simultaneously receiving a plurality of low-speed (G3) faxes, 

bundling them into a single fax for transmission to a common distribution, and 
transmitting the single fax as a high-speed (G4) fax to the destination. At the 

destination, the high-speed fax is received, unbundled into its constituent faxes, and 
the constituent faxes are distributed as low-speed (G3) faxes to a plurality of 

recipients.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to facsimile telecommunications systems.As facsimile (fax) telecommunications have become ubiquitous in the
business world, fax equipment providers have come under pressure from large-volume
fax end-users and fax service providers to improve the efficiency of fax
telecommunications provided by the equipment, as a means for the equipment users
to reduce their costs. The equipment providers have responded with various
improvements, including fax servers that provide store-and-forward fax services
with receipt-of-fax notification, automatic fax-send retry in case of the destination
equipment being busy or indicating failure of reception, automatic broadcasting of a
fax to a list of recipients, delayed fax transmission to take advantage of reduced rates
during off-peak-use hours, high data-rate transmissions of a plurality of faxes at one
time in a continuous batch to a destination fax server, and distribution of the batch of
faxes to their final recipients by the destination fax server. One example of such a
server is the AT&T FAX Attendant Systemâ„¢. Another example is disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 4,994,926. Illustrative batch transmission schemes are disclosed in
this patent and in U.S. Patent No. 5,084,770, and in published European Patent
Application publication no. 0 480 634 A2. And examples of high-data-rate
transmission schemes may be found in U.S. Patent No. 4,910,610,
U.S. Patent No. 5,117,453, and U.S. Patent No. Re. 31,182.
Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 13, No. 23 (E-75), 19 January 1989, referring to JP-A-63
227 172 (Fujitsu LTD) 21.9.1988, discloses a fax communication method
comprising the steps of collecting a plurality of faxes, combining the plurality of
faxes into a single file, and transmitting the single file. Furthermore, the Ricoh
FAX7000D is capable of bundling a plurality of sequentially-received Group 3 faxes
into a single Group 4 fax for transmission, and printing the constituent faxes of a
bundled Group 4 fax.We have recognized that continuing inefficiencies in fax
telecommunications result from the prior art's persistence in either treating
individual faxes as individual faxes for purposes of inter-server transmissions of the
faxes, even in the batch and high data-rate transmission modes, or in treating
individual faxes as sequential communications for purposes of their collection and
distribution. According to our invention, therefore, a plurality of low-speed faxes,
such as Group 3 faxes, is simultaneously collected, through one or more channels,
and
