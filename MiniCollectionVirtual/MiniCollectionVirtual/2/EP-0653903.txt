<ABSTRACT>
A cold cathode fluorescent tube assembly comprises a 
cold cathode fluorescent tube (1) having first and second 

terminals (2,3) and a voltage source (7) connected to the 
terminals to generate a voltage therebetween. The first 

terminal extends (4) along the tube and is arranged such 
that progressively varying the voltage applied to the 

terminals by the voltage source causes fluorescence to 
occur in a corresponding progressive manner along the tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cold cathode fluorescent 
tube assembly and a method of controlling a cold cathode 
fluorescent tube. When driving cold cathode fluorescent (CCF) lamps as 
used for the illumination of liquid crystal displays in 
applications such as lap-top computers and other 
information devices etc, the application often requires the 
ability to smoothly adjust the fluorescent lamp's 
brightness level between the fully on, and the fully off 
conditions. However, conventional fluorescent tubes normally 
exhibit a pop-on effect in terms of illumination levels 
when the tube first strikes following the application of 
sufficient voltage, and similarly exhibit a tendency to 
pop-off in terms of illumination level, when the supplied 
voltage is sufficiently reduced. This sudden turning on and turning off in terms of 
illumination levels, is apparent when a fluorescent lamp is 
driven by applied voltage or current control circuitry. These effects prevent absolute control of the tube's 
output brightness, and this applies both for single and in 
particular multi-tube drive applications, where one tube 
may illuminate and deprive power from other tubes in the 
system; until sufficient power is applied that the 
remaining tubes also illuminate, resulting in erratic and 
poor illumination control between the lamps. Conventionally, the solution to this has been to 
provide multiple circuits which operate fluorescent tubes 
or ordinary incandescent bulbs according to the required 
light level. This adds to the cost in both components and 
the manufacturing process. GB-A-1250376 describes a linear gas-discharge 
indicator for indicating the variation in a parameter. 
This makes use of a gas discharge tube having a pair of 
electrodes and a third electrode which extends alongside  
 
the tube and which is maintained negative with respect to 
the first electrode by a steady voltage of sufficient 
magnitude to start a glow discharge providing preionisation 
within the tube. A much lower second voltage 
difference is then applied between the third and second 
electrodes to cause a glow discharge along a portion of the 
second electrode. This is a relatively complex system 
requiring the use of three electrodes and the application 
of two different voltages and in practice would not 
generate sufficient light for illuminating other objects. In accordance with a first aspect of the present 
invention, a cold cathode fluorescent tube assembly 
comprises a cold cathode fluorescent tube having first and 
second
