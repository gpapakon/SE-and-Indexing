<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus 10 for grinding tapers and points on 
elongated needle workpieces having frame means 12 and needle 

workpiece transport means 20 associated with the frame means for 
transporting a plurality of the workpieces. The workpiece 

transport means has a predetermined curvature and workpiece 
feeder means 120 is mounted adjacent the frame means for feeding 

workpieces to the workpiece transport means. The grinding means 
is preferably a grinding wheel 14 disposed adjacent the 

workpiece transport means to engage workpieces while supported 
by workpiece supporting means and has a major diameter at a 

first end 96 and a minor diameter at a second end 98, the major 
diameter being greater than the minor diameter. The diameters 

are connected by a curved grinding surface the diameter of which 
increases progressively therebetween. The curvature of the 

grinding wheel in the first third portion between the major and 
minor diameters is of greater mean curvature than the mean 

curvature of the corresponding opposed portion of the workpiece 
transport means. The second third portion of the grinding wheel 

is of greater mean curvature than the mean curvature of the 
corresponding opposed portion of the workpiece transport means. 

The mean curvature difference therebetween is less than the 
difference of the first portion with respective to the first 

portion's corresponding opposed portion of the workpiece 
tranport means, and the third portion being of lesser mean 

curvature than the corresponding opposed portion of the 
workpiece transport means such that a surface portion of a 

workpiece which contacts the grinding surface varies relative to 
the position of the workpiece with respect to the grinding 

surface. A method of grinding needle workpieces is also 
disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and method for
grinding tapers on elongated stock and more particularly for
grinding points on needle stock.The production of quality needles from raw stock
involves many different processes and machinery. These varying
processes and machinery become more critical in the preparation
of surgical needles where the environment of intended use is in
humans or animals. Some of the processes involved in the
production of surgical grade needles include, inter alia:
straightening spooled wire stock; cutting needle blanks from raw
stock; providing a bore for receiving suture thread at one end
of the blank; tapering or grinding points at the other end of
the blank, flat pressing a portion of the needle barrel to
facilitate easier grasping by surgical instrumentation; and,
where curved needles are desired, curving the needle. During
each of these several steps, extreme care must be taken to
ensure that only the intended working of the needle is performed
and that the other parts of the needle remain undisturbed.Machines for grinding points of needles are known.
Such machines include the Type NS 6, 8, 11 and 15 automatic
point grinding machines available from SCHUMAG Machinery, Inc.
of Norwood, N.J. Those machines utilize, for example, a
transport wheel and saddle arrangement to present wire shafts to
a grinding wheel so as to grind points on the ends of the
shafts. A notched wheel is provided for spacing apart the wire
shafts and presenting them to the grinding wheel surface.
Different sized notched wheels are required for different wire
shaft diameters. Thus, in order to change diameter shafts being
ground, the appropriate notched wheel must first be installed
before grinding of the differing diameter shaft needle blanks 
can take place. This requires shutting down production and fitting the machine with the
appropriate notched wheel each time stock having a diameter not appropriate for the current
wheel is to be ground.Additionally, to operate efficiently, these machines require that the minimum wire
shalt length must be longer than many of the surgical needles presently in use, thus necessitating
additional finishing steps to refine the dimensions of the needles. Therefore, in order to form a
finished needle, for example, having a length of 22.23 mm (0.875 inches), stock of at least 44.45
mm (1-3/4 inches) would have to first be ground and then be clipped to the desired length. By
performing the grinding first and then having to clip the needle shaft to the desired length,
