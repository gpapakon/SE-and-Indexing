<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical information processing system
functionally comprised of coding means to individually code a plurality of optical
information carrier waves, and processing means coupled to the coding means and
operative to process the plurality of coded information carrier waves.The benefits from optical information processing, i.e., performing
calculations and transmission, are manifold when compared to electronic equivalents.
First, parallel I/O and connectivity can be greatly increased without substantial penalty
in terms of system size, as optical implementations permit large fan-in and fan-out
operation and has innate parallelism and dense interconnection capabilities. In contrast,
electrically conductive interconnections in electronic computers must be separated by at
least a minimum critical distance to avoid interference. Second, optical arrangements
are not confined to the restrictions of the, basically, planar configurations inherent to
integrated electronic circuitry, thus permitting use of all three dimensions to create a
compact system. Third, the operation of optical devices is not susceptible to parasitic
effects and system delays to the same extent as electronic devices. The latter's
functioning is ultimately determined by parasitic capacitances that have a progressively
more pronounced influence as the electronic device's dimensions are further reduced.
Accordingly, purely optical processing and transmission is, by its very nature, faster
than electronic information handling. Typically, optical processing reigns in the picosecond
domain, whereas the electronic systems of today meet their limits typically in
the nano-second domain.For an indication of what is achievable in optical computing see, for
example, Electronic Engineering, April 1990, pages 18 and 21. Switches, simple logic
gates and memory cells can be implemented with optically operating devices. 
A typical example of a known optical information processing system using
a light source and an encoding means for controlling a light intensity of the emitted
light is discussed in "Variable Sensitivity Photodetector for Optical Neural Networks",
J. Ohta et al., Journal of Lightwave Technology, Vol. 9, No. 12, pp. 1747-1754,
December 1991. This prior art reference relates to a partly optical implementation of a
neural net.In general, a neural net is an information handling system for mapping an
input representation onto an output representation, using distributed and highly parallel
processing by densely
