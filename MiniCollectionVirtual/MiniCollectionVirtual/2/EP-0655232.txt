<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an emergency cervical orthesis of the neck collar type. This orthesis comprises a band (1) of a semi-rigid material such as a plastic foam, this band having an essentially continuous and rigid central part (5) adjoined on each side by flexible tongues (4) which extend from this central part (5) to the edges of the band, the latter being intended to enclose and support, via its central part (5), the neck of a patient, optionally with at least partial covering of the extremities, while the adjoining tongues (4) deform so as to match the profile where the neck merges with the trunk and where it merges with the head of the patient.

An emergency cervical orthosis of the cervical
collar type, comprising a first band (1) having a

substantially continuous semi-rigid central part (5) with
which flexible tongues (4) are contiguous on either side,

which tongues extend from this central part (5) up to the
edges of the band, the latter being intended to enclose,

while supporting it, with its central part (5), the neck of
a patient, optionally with at least partial overlapping of

its ends, whereas the contiguous tongues (4), by deforming,
adapt to the profile connecting the neck to the body and to

the head of the patient, said orthosis being characterised
in that the first band (1) is made of a foam of plastics

material and has one flat surface and one slightly convex
surface, the thickness of this first band (1) decreasing

from its central part (5) up to the ends of the tongues (4),
and in that a second band (2) of a more flexible material is

provided in extension of the first band (1) and adjoins one
end thereof in such a way that it can be wrapped around it.
