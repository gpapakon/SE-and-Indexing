<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of 3,7-dihydro-3,7-dimethyl-1-(5-oxohexyl)-1H-purine-2,6-dione 
(generic 

name: pentoxifylline) and/or 1-(3',4'-diethoxybenzyl)-6,7-diethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolinium 
theophylline-7-acetate 

(Depogen) or monohydrate thereof for preparing a 
pharmaceutical composition suitable for improving the 

tissue antioxidant status. This status plays an important 
role in complications, occurring as a consequence 

of pathologically developed or artificially 
established anastomoses, particularly anastomosis of 

oesophagus and colon since these organs possess a very 
weak antioxidant protective system. 
The invention furthermore relates to the preparation 
of the above pharmaceutical compositions. 
The above active ingredients promote and accelerate 
the healing process of anastomoses by improving the 

tissue antioxidant status and besides, they retain their 
good inhibitory effect on the adhesion of anastomoses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition 
containing as active ingredient 3,7-dihydro-3,7-dimethyl-1-(5-oxohexyl)-1H-purine-2,6-dione 
and/or 
1-(3',4'-diethoxybenzyl)-6,7-diethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolinium 
theophylline-7-acetate or its monohydrate 
and a process for the preparation thereof. According to 
this process 3,7-dihydro-3,7-dimethyl-1-(5-oxo-hexyl)-1H-purine-2,6-dione 
and/or 1-(3',4'-diethoxybenzyl)-6,7-diethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolinium 
theophylline-7-acetate 
or its monohydrate prepared in a manner known 
per se are mixed together with filling, diluting agents 
and other auxiliaries (additives) commonly used in the 
drug manufacture and the mixture obtained is converted to 
a pharmaceutical composition useful for improving the 
tissue antioxidant status. Furthermore, the invention also relates to the use 
of 3,7-dihydro-3,7-dimethyl-1-(5-oxohexyl)-1H-purine-2,6-dione 
and/or 1-(3'4'-diethoxybenzyl)-6,7-diethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolinium 
theophylline-7-acetate or its 
monohydrate as active ingredient for the preparation of a 
pharmaceutical composition useful for improving the 
tissue antioxidant status; as well as to a method of 
improving the tissue antioxidant status, which comprises 
using a therapeutically effective amount of 3,7-dihydro-3,7-dimethyl-1-(5-oxohexyl)-1H-purine-2,6-dione 
and/or 
1-(3',4'-diethoxybenzyl)-6,7-diethoxy-3,4-dihydroiso-quinolinium 
theophylline-7-acetate or the monohydrate 
thereof.  The preparation of 3,7-dihydro-3,7-dimethyl-1-(5-oxohexyl)-1H-purine-2,6-dione 
(TRENTALR; generic name: 
pentoxifylline) and 1-(3',4'-diethoxybensyl)-6,7-diethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolinium 
theophylline-7-acetate 
(Depogen) or its monohydrate, respectively is described 
interalia in the following patent specification: GB No. 
1,079,267; German No. 2,234,202; Czechoslowak No. 
164,343; as well as Hungarian No. 167,246 and Hungarian 
No. T/42449 made open to public inspection. It is known that both pentoxifylline and Depogen 
improve the microcirculation of the blood [Angiology 36, 
pages 2226-2234 (1984); as well as Hungarian patent 
specification No. 197,207]. Anastomosis insufficiency is the most severe complication 
of chirurgical interventions made in the 
gastrointestinal system. In spite of the modern suture 
techniques and up-to-date antibiotic treatments, the 
occurrence of this complication is very frequent, significantly 
prolongs the period of hospital treatment and 
increases the rate of mortality. Complications most frequently occur at anastomoses
