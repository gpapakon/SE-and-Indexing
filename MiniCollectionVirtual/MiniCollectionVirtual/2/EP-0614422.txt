<ABSTRACT>
A vehicular suspension system incorporates, at each wheel (14), a liquid spring (12) which internally utilizes a compressible liquid to generate spring and damping forces that yieldingly resist vertical wheel deflection relative to the vehicle frame. The liquid spring includes a dual piston assembly (36) which divides a main cylinder into bounce (38) and rebound (40) chambers. A rotary metering valve (80) is interposed between the bounce (38) and rebound (40) chambers for controlling the flow of compressible liquid from one chamber to the other during bounce and rebound. The dual piston assembly includes a tubular piston (48) having a modulation chamber (52) coupled in flow communication with the bounce chamber (38). The spring and damping characteristics of each liquid spring are computer adjusted during vehicle operation by modulating the bounce chamber pressure in response to sensed variations in various liquid spring and vehicle operating parameters.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to suspension systems
for land vehicles and, in a preferred embodiment thereof,
to a liquid spring suspension system in which the spring
and damping characteristics of each liquid spring are
computer adjusted, during vehicle operation, in response to
sensed variations in liquid spring and vehicle operating
parameters.Various proposals have been made for replacing the
conventional hydraulic shock absorber and exterior coil
spring assemblies in vehicular suspension systems with more
compact devices known as liquid springs. A conventional
liquid spring includes a cylindrical housing having an
internal chamber with a compressible liquid therein, a
piston reciprocally disposed in the chamber, a rod
structure secured to the piston and axially movable into and
out of the chamber, and having an external strut projecting
outwardly of one of the housing ends. With the liquid
spring operatively interconnected between the vehicle frame
and an associated wheel support structure, the compressible
working liquid generates both spring and damping forces in
the suspension system in response to relative axial
translation between the rod structure and housing of the 
liquid spring caused by relative vertical displacement
between the wheel and the frame.The compressible working liquid permits the system to
exhibit a non-linear force/deflection curve. This non-linear
behavior is important because it offers lower spring
rates during normal operation and higher spring rates when
the vehicle strikes a bump. Non-linearity in the system is
provided by the compressibility of the silicone-based
working liquid, which is approximately 1.5 to 2 times more
compressible than conventional hydraulic fluid. In
operation, the non-linear system provides a spring rate
which increases exponentially when the strut moves from its
normal static position to full compression. This increase
permits the suspension unit to absorb sharp bumps without
bottoming out. In contrast, if the spring rate were
linear, a substantially greater piston stroke would be
required to enable the suspension unit to absorb comparable
bounce forces.Conventional liquid spring suspensions can be tuned
and readily adjusted for differing vehicle weights
(springing force) and different ride characteristics
(dampening). It will be appreciated that non-linear struts
that utilize a compressible working liquid for both
springing and dampening have a potential for superior
performance.Various arrangements have been proposed for
selectively adjusting
