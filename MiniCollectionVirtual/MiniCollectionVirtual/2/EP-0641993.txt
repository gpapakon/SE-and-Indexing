<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image processing
method and apparatus and more particularly to a method
and apparatus for processing data defining 3-D
geometrical shape using triangular patches.There have been suggested a variety of so-called 
range finders, which are designed to radiate a beam to a
target object (an object to be measured) to determine a
distance to the object by taking advantage of the beam
reflected from the object and by carrying out two-dimensional
optical scan over the entire object, thus
obtaining the distance information on the object.As the methods for measuring a distance to an
object, which are employed in the aforesaid range
finders, there is a method, wherein an optical pulse is
emitted to the object and the distance is determined by
measuring the time required for the optical pulse to
reflect back from the object, and there is another
method, wherein a beam with its intensity modulated into
a sine wave is launched into a target object and the
distance to the target object is determined by detecting
the phase difference between the beam reflected from the
object and the original beam. The recent progress in
semiconductor lasers and the high-frequency circuit
technology has enabled these methods to measure
distances with a resolution of 1 mm or less and they are
used for measuring the position of an object located at
a short distance, identifying an object and the like.There has also been proposed a shape measuring
apparatus which is designed to emit a beam from a light
source to an object via reflecting mirrors, and at this
time, the reflecting mirrors are driven by driving means 
to two-dimensionally scan the object with the beam in
order to detect the changes in the optical path length
by utilizing the beam reflected from the object, thus
measuring the shape of the object (references:
OPTOELECTRONICS (1985, No. 12, pp. 59, by Seiji
Inokuchi, et al.).In the aforesaid shape measuring apparatus, an
object to be measured is spatially held or rested. This
makes it necessary to have the object undergo two-dimensional
optical scanning from restricted directions,
presenting a problem in that the rear, top or bottom
surface, etc. of the object cannot be measured.The image distance information obtained by using
the shape measuring apparatus described above is
referred to as a range image. More specifically, in the
range image, the information on depth and position is
stored in each picture element position thereof, while
in a variable-density image or color image taken by a
typic
