<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a check valve of the type mentioned 
in the first part of claim 1. Such a check valve has 
applicability in portable painting equipment, particularly for 
venting a paint cup attached to an HVLP (High Volume Low 
Pressure) paint sprayer. In the past, check valves for air lines 
have included a two-piece housing (as shown in 
Figure 1) with the two pieces permanently joined 
together. Such prior art check valves also included 
a resilient disc captured between the inseparable 
halves to provide the one-way flow characteristic. Such prior art check valves were not 
serviceable and required replacement of the entire 
check valve in the event of contamination or wear 
out of any of the parts of the valve. A check valve of the type as described in the first part of 
claim 1 is known from US-A-4 765 372. Whereas also in that 
known check valve the two housing portions preferably are 
permanently connected by e.g. ultrasonic welding, they can 
also be screwed together in a fluid-tight manner for the 
purpose of exchanging the flexible disc in order to modify the 
fluid flow properties. It is the problem of the present invention to provide an 
easily serviceable check valve. This problem is met by claim 
1. Figure 1 is a prior art check valve 
assembly shown in section. Figure 2 is an end-on view of the disc-like 
diaphragm of the prior art check valve of 
Figure 1. Figure 3 is an end on view of a first 
housing portion of the prior art check valve 
assembly of Figure 1. Figure 4 is an end on view of a second 
housing portion of the prior art check valve 
assembly of Figure 1.  
 Figure 5 is an exploded section view of 
the parts of the prior art check valve assembly 
shown in Figures 2-4. Figure 6 is an end-on view of a check 
valve according to the present invention. Figure 7 is an end-on view from the 
opposite end of the check valve of the present 
invention. Figure 8 is a section view taken along 
line 8-8 of Figure 6. Figure 9 is an end on view of the first 
housing portion of the check valve of the present 
invention. Figure 10 is a section view taken along 
line 10-10 of Figure 9. Figure 11 is an end-on view of a check 
valve element useful in the practice of the present 
invention. Figure 12 is a side view partially in 
section of the check valve element of Figure 11. Figure 13 is an end-on view of a second 
housing portion of the check valve of the present 
invention. Figure 14 is a section view along line 14-14 
of Figure 13. Figure 15 is a section view of the check 
valve

<CLAIMS>
Check valve of the type having a relatively rigid inflow 
housing portion (38) with an inflow bore (40) therethrough, 

a relatively rigid outflow housing portion (42) 
with an outflow bore (44) therethrough, and a relatively 

flexible disk (46) retained between the inflow and 
outflow housing portions (38, 42) for permitting fluid 

flow from the inflow bore (40) to the outflow bore (44) 
and for blocking fluid flow from the outflow bore to the 

inflow bore, interengaging threads (64, 66) being 
provided on the inflow and outflow housing portions (38, 

42) for threadably retaining the inflow and outflow 
housing portions together and interengaging circumferential 

tongue and groove means (68, 70) on the inflow 
and outflow housing portions (38, 42) for providing a 

circumferential seal between the inflow and outflow 
housing portions, characterized in that the tongue and 

groove means (68, 70) have nesting trapezoidal cross 
sections. 
Check valve of claim 1 further comprising a concave seat 
surrounding the central bore in the inflow housing 

portion (38) and wherein the disk seals against the seat 
to prevent fluid flow from the outflow portion of the 

inflow portion. 
Check valve of claim 2 further comprising a plurality of 
convex ribs (56) surrounding from the central bore in the 

outflow housing portion (42) and wherein the disk is 
supported by the ribs to permit fluid flow from the 

inflow portion to the outflow portion.  
 
Check valve of claim 3 further comprising a predetermined 
clearance between the ribs and the disk when the disk is 

resting against the seat in the inflow housing portion. 
Check valve of one of the preceding claims wherein the 
relatively flexible disk member (46) further comprises a 

stem (48) formed integral with and extending generally 
out of the plane of the disk and received in the central 

bore of one of the inflow and outflow housing portions 
such that the flexible disk is restrained from radial 

misalignment by the reception of the stem in the bore. 
Check valve of one of the preceding claims wherein the 

trapezoidal cross sections of the tongue and groove means 
(68, 70) are not congruent. 
Check valve or claim 6, wherein the trapezoidal cross 
section of the tongue (68) has a taper angle larger than 

a taper angle of the trapezoidal cross section of the 
groove (70). 
Check valve of claim 7, wherein the tongue (68) circumferentially 
seals against the groove (70) when the inflow 

and outflow housing portions are threadably secured 
together. 
Check valve of claim 8 wherein the tongue and groove 
means (68, 70) deforms to a common taper angle along a 

portion of the nesting cross sections in contact with 
each other.
