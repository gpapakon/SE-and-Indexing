<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a combination (100) of an intra-uterine contraceptive device (IUD) (1), a corresponding hollow applicator (2) suitable for introducing the IUD into the womb and a piston (3) movable in relation to the applicator, the cranial end of which bears on the caudal end of the IUD. The IUD (1) consists of a cylindrical body (4) and two flexible arms (6 and 6') secured to one end of the body. At its cranial end, the applicator (2) has a longitudinal aperture (12) and an elastic web (14) which thickens towards its cranial end (16). The web (14) has a guide for the IUD (1). The applicator (2) and the piston each have a holder (13 and 19) at their cranial ends. The combination is designed to improve ease of handling during the fitting of an IUD and to reduce the risk of injury.
