<ABSTRACT>
A roller bearing installation, in which one or more 
roller bearing assemblies (30A, 30B, 30C) are 

prepackaged in a housing (18) having corresponding 
recesses (28A, 28B, 28C) receiving each bearing assembly 

(30A, 30B, 30C). An angled gib plate (52A, 52B, 52C) is 
bedded in each recess, each gib plate (52) including an 

inclined section (54) mating with an inclined surface 
(58) on a bearing assembly cover (72) to allow a bearing 

depth adjustment by lengthwise adjustment of the bearing 
assembly (30) in its recess, enabling position 

adjustment of the supported structure (10) and bearing 
preload adjustment. Accurate alignment of the bearing 

assembly (30) is achieved by a ball plunger (100) urging 
the same against a guide surface (57) of the gib plate 

(52). A fixture (110) is used to precisely locate each 
gib plate (52A, 52B, 52C) in a recess (28) while a 

moldable bonding material (109) in which each gib plate 
(52) is bedded sets up. Electromagnetic coils (146, 

148) are used to releasably hold each gib plate (52) on 
a respective locator arm (134, 136) during the process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns installation of way 
bearings as are used in supporting machine tool 
structures for linear motion on way surfaces, and more 
particularly installations of way bearings of the 
recirculating roller type. In machine tools and other similar machines and 
apparatus it is often necessary to support relatively 
heavy structural components for precision movement along 
way surfaces. The accuracy of machining depends on the accuracy 
of the motion of such components along their respective 
axis. Simple plain bearings, used for many years, have 
more recently been replaced by various linear roller 
bearings in order to reduce friction. A successfull 
version of such bearings is the so called recirculating 
roller bearing in which a series of roller elements move 
about a circulation path accurately ground into the  
 
periphery of a track member, with a surrounding and 
enclosing bearing cover confining the rollers in their 
recirculation path. The roller elements are exposed on 
one side of the bearing assembly such as to enable 
rolling movement along a way surface with the supported 
structure mounted to the bearing cover. In order to achieve the accurate linear motion, the 
axis of the bearing assembly must be precisely aligned 
with the desired direction of motion of the supported 
structure, and this also prevents skewing forces tending 
to reduce bearing life. In US-A-4 544 211 
there is disclosed an improved recirculating 
roller bearing in which skewing forces are minimized in 
the bearing assembly. Two sets of roller elements each circulate about 
the track member on either side of a central divider. Installation of such bearing assembly in the 
supported structure typically involves precision 
machining of locating surfaces in order to properly 
align the bearing assembly within the supporting 
structure. There is oftentime a need to provide adjustability 
of the bearing depth and in such instances a gib wedge 
plate package is provided in which a pair of plates 
having matching inclined surfaces are adjusted 
lengthwise relative to each other in order to provide a  
 
adjustment of the depth of the installed bearing 
assembly. Such bearing assemblies are typically installed in 
sets, each comprised of a number of variously facing 
bearings such as to engage a series of surfaces on the 
supporting structure, such as above and below a way 
surface and along a lateral edge. In such instances it 
is usual to provide such bearing adjustment for enabling 
precision adjustment of a
