<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for removing paint from used parts or reject parts, in particular made from polycarbonate (PC) or a polycarbonate blend, preferably with polybutylene terephthalate (PBT/PC), in order to recycle the plastic. In this process, the plastic parts are first mechanically comminuted to a pourable part size and then circulated in bulk together with anhydrous alkalinised diethylene glycol or propylene glycol with mutual abrasion of the plastic chips at elevated temperature (at least 50 DEG C, preferably at from 80 to 100 DEG C) until all the paint has been removed. The stripped plastic chips are then separated from the paint remover, rinsed and subsequently dried. The amount of glycol added corresponds to from 1 to 10% by volume of the volume of bulk material to be treated, in such a way that the circulated parts are merely wetted by the glycol, but paint remover from a larger stock is constantly circulated through the treatment space of the bulk material. The circulation of the bulk part is preferably carried out in a sealable free-fall or forced mixer or in a rotary mixer. During the abrasive circulation, abrasive particles whose specific density approximately corresponds to the specific density of the plastic parts are preferably added to the plastic parts.

Process for the stripping of used parts or reject
parts of plastic - called plastics parts for short

hereinafter - with the aim of recycling the stripped
plastic, in which the plastics parts are first mechanically

comminuted to a pourable size, in which the
plastics chips are circulated at elevated temperature

together with an alkalified glycol, and in which after a
certain treatment time the stripped plastics chips are

separated from the stripping agent, flushed and then
dried, characterized in that in order to strip coated

plastics parts they are circulated together with an
anhydrous, alkalified diethylene glycol or propylene

glycol - together called "stripping agent" hereinafter -
in a mass with mutual abrasion of the plastics parts at

at least 50°C, the quantity of stripping agent added
being from 1 to 10 % of the volume of the mass to be

treated, so that the circulated parts are only wetted by
the stripping agent.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the circulation of the plastics parts is carried out

at from 80 to 100°C.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that plastics parts of polycarbonate (PC) or of a polycarbonate

blend, preferably with polybutylene terephthalate
(PBT/PC), are stripped.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the stripping agent is conveyed from a reservoir

continuously through the treatment space of the mass and
is circulated in a circuit. 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the circulated reservoir of stripping agent present

in the circuit corresponds in volume terms to from 0.3 to
5 times the mass which is located in the treatment space.
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in
that in volume terms from 0.7 of 2 times the mass of

stripping agent which is located in the treatment space
is circulated.
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the process heat of the circulated mass, which is

necessary for the stripping operation, is supplied at
least in part indirectly by way of the circulated

stripping agent, this stripping agent being heated
outside the treatment space in the circulation system.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the plastics parts are first mechanically comminuted

to a size such that the largest edge length or overall
length of the parts measures less than 20 cm for about

90 % by weight of the parts and measures greater than
1 mm for at least 99 % by weight of the parts.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the plastics parts are first mechanically comminuted

to a size such that about 90 % by weight of the parts
weigh less than 50 g each and at least 99.5 % of the

parts weigh more than 5 mg each.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the plastics parts are circulated in a closable

free-fall mixer or positive mixer or in a rotary tube
mixer.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the plastics parts are circulated in the presence of

abrasive particles which are produced from a material
which is resistant to alkali and glycol.
Process according to Claim 11, characterized in
that the plastics parts are circulated in the presence of

abrasive particles which are produced from stainless
steel plate.
Process according to Claim 11, characterized in
that the co-circulated abrasive particles have a specific 

apparent density which corresponds to from 0.2 to 5 times
the specific apparent density of the plastics parts.
Process according to Claim 13, characterized in

that the specific apparent density of the abrasive
particles corresponds to from 0.5 to 2 times the specific

apparent density of the plastics parts.
Process according to Claim 11, characterized in

volume of the mass - the proportion of abrasive particles

is from 1 to 20 % by volume thereof.
Process according to Claim 15, characterized in
that the proportion of abrasive particles is from 5 to
