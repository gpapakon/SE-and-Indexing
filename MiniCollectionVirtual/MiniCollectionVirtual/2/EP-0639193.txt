<DESCRIPTION>
 ESTERS OF ANTIBACTERIAL CONDENSED CARBAPENEME DERIVATIVESThis invention relates to heterocyclic derivatives having antibacterial activity , to processes for their preparation to compositions containing them and to their use in medicine .Thus the present invention provides compounds of the general formula (I )in which R^ represents the group CHθαθ)pR5R 4 Owherein R^ represents a hydrogen atom or a Cj^^alkyl group; p is zero or one, and R5 represents a group selected from C1_6alkyl, C5_gcycloalkyl optionally substituted by a C1_3alkyl group, phenyl, or C^^alkyl substituted by a C^^alkoxy group.R2 represents a C1-3 alkyl, hydroxy, or hydroxymethyl group or 2 represents the group XR3 wherein X is oxygen and R3 represents a c3_7 cycloalkyl or phenyl group or X is the group S(0)n wherein n is zero or the integer 1 or 2 and R3 is C1_ςalkyl, C3_7cycloalkyl or phenyl.In addition to the fixed stereochemical arrangement as defined in formula (I) the molecule contains a further asymmetric carbon atoms at the 8 and another at the 4 position. Also the group ^ contains at least one asymmetric carbon atom when R4 is other than hydrogen. It will be appreciated that all stereoisomers including mixtures thereof arising from these additional asymmetric centres, are within the scope of the compounds of formula (I).The general formula (I) as drawn includes at least 4 stereoisomers and mixtures thereof and these may be represented by the formulae (la, lb, lc and Id). 
The wedge shaped bond ^ indicates that the bond is above th plane of the paper. The broken bond . m indicates that the bond i below the plane of the paper.The configuration shown for the carbon atom at the 8-positio in formulae la and lb is hereinafter referred to as the β configuration and in formulae lc and Id as the a- configuration.The configuration shown for the carbon at the 4-position in f ormu lae lb and I d is hereina f ter ref erred to a s the a- configuration and in formulae la and lc as the R configuration .In general , in the specific compounds named below, the j3- configuration at the 8-position corresponds to the S isomer and the β-conf iguration at the 4-position to the R isomer . The a- configuration at the 8-position corresponds to the R isomer and the a- configuration at the 4-position corresponds to the S isomer . The assignment of the R or S configuration at the 4- and 8-positions has been made according to the rules of Cahn . Ingold and Prelog , Experientia 1956, ____, 81.The term alkyl as usual herein refers to a straight or branched
