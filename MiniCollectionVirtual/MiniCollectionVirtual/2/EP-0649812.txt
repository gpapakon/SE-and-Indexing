<ABSTRACT>
A mechanical limit control device for adjustably halting 
the operation of a winch (102) at preset points including 

a proportionally driven flexible cog belt (17) providing a 
compact conformable configuration having projections (27) 

which operate a snap action air valve (3) to limit the 
deployment extent of a pneumatically operated winch.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a directional control 
assembly for a winch and more particularly to a mechanical 
limit device for adjustably halting the operation of a 
winch at a preset point in the machine cycle. A mechanical limit device can be generally described as a 
device that halts the operation of a machine at a preset 
point in the machine's cycle and prevents further operation 
until the device is reset by some action. A device of this 
type is often used on a winch to limit the raising and 
lowering point extent of a load. Once the limit has been 
reached, the operator would normally be required to reverse 
the winch for a certain distance in order to reset the 
device. Two common types of mechanical device in current use today 
are either rotary or linear devices driven through gear 
reduction by the machine. Rotary devices are geared to 
track the movement of the machine in less than one 
revolution of a cam which is used to activate a switch to 
turn off the machine. Similarly, a linear device is geared 
to track the movement of the machine by employing a 
threaded nut travelling along a lead screw to activate a 
switch. The closer the tracking movement is to the 
movement of the machine, the greater will be the accuracy 
of the device and this determines the. exact stopping point 
at each present limit and the minimum operating distance 
between the limits. For increased tracking movement, it is 
desirable to make the cam in a rotary device as large a 
diameter as possible and the lead screw in a linear device 
as long as possible. Rotary devices are generally 
preferred since they will continue to rotate beyond one 
revolution should the switch fail to stop the machine as  
 
intended. If the switch on a linear device should fail to 
stop the machine, the travelling nut will eventually reach 
the end of the lead screw. At this point it must disengage 
to avoid damage to the components. Once disengaged, it 
will require retiming before it can function again. According to the present invention, there is provided
 
   a directional control assembly characterised by
 
   a means for producing a first signal of a ratioed 
position indicating proportionality;
 
   a means for producing a second signal indicative of an 
adjustable preset limit of said first signal; and
 
   said means for producing said first signal including 
an endless belt. For a better understanding of the invention and to show how 
the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be 
made, by way of example,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A directional control assembly (100) characterised by 
   a means for producing a first signal of a ratioed 

position indicating proportionality;

for producing said second signal further comprises a 

discontinuity (27) of said endless belt. 
An assembly according to claim 2, wherein said 
discontinuity (27) includes means for activating a control 

valve (3). 
An assembly according to claim 2 or 3, wherein said 
discontinuity comprises a raised portion (27) on the 

exterior of said endless belt. 
An assembly according to claim 3 or 4, wherein said 
control valve is a snap action poppet valve (3). 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein said endless belt is a toothed belt. 
An assembly according to claim 6, wherein a cog wheel 
(5) is adjustable in rotary position relative to said shaft 

(23) on which it is mounted.
