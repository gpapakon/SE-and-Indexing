<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a centralized command system for a telecommunications network, in which system a central exchange (1) of a telecommunications network and network elements (3a-3c), such as local concentrators, under its control form an entity which is controllable in a centralized manner from the central exchange (1) by means of user interfaces of individual concentrators. The system comprises a program command structure in which the command sequences required by each task and directed to the central exchange and/or one or more network elements are combined so as to form a single logical task entity, or macro, on the basis of which the system automatically initiates embedded terminal sessions with the necessary network elements (3a-3c) and executes the commands necessary for performing the given task.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a centralized command
system for a telecommunications network, in which system
a central exchange of a telecommunications network and
network elements, such as local concentrators, under its
control form an entity which is controllable in a
centralized manner from the central exchange by means
of user interfaces of individual concentrators.It is becoming more and more general to use
concentrators of different levels in connection with
digital exchanges in public telecommunications networks.
By the use of concentrators, subscribers can be effectively
gathered from a wide area to a large tandem or
regional exchange. Concentrators are placed in villages
and, as the capacity increases, presently even in small
towns.A central exchange with its concentrators can
thus offer digital telephone services over a wide area.
From the point of view of an operator, such a concept
has several advantages. Subscribers can be numbered
freely on the entire wide exchange area. The operation
of the exchange is centralized, and the whole large
entity can be treated as one exchange. All management
tasks, such as the control of subscribers, or the updating
and changing of software, can be effected in a
centralized manner.The central exchange and its concentrators are
operated in a centralized manner from the central
exchange. On the other hand, the concentrators are
required to operate very independently, particularly
when connections to the central exchange are broken. A
concentrator must be capable of switching internal
traffic without the control of the central exchange, and 
it must be possible to store the computed data produced by
it during the break.There are two alternative ways of implementing
concentrators. A concentrator can be developed from an
independent exchange or from a simpler subscriber level.
When it is developed from an independent exchange, a large
number of features of independent operation can easily be
included in it. The problem is rather how to arrange
uniform operation functions in such a manner that a
plurality of entities "independent" from an operational
point of view are seen by the user as in a single large
exchange.In practice, this often means that the operation
and control tasks pertaining to the entire network are
divided into several subtasks to be carried out in
different parts of the network (i.e. in concentrators).
The management of the whole task requires strict control
of the subtasks and ability to cope with many fault
situations, which may occur when only part

<CLAIMS>
A centralised command system for a telecommunications
network, comprising:


a central exchange (1) located within the network; and
concentrators (3a-3c; A-E) distributed within the network
located separately from the central exchange, the

concentrators and the central exchange constituting an
entity which is controllable in a centralised manner from

the central exchange by means of operation control interfaces of
individual concentrators wherein operation and control

tasks of the network are divided into subtasks involving
one or more of the concentrators;
characterised in that
 the centralised command system
comprises a program-based command structure in which the

command sequences required by each subtask and directed to
the central exchange and one or more of the concentrators

are combined so as to form a macro, the program-based
command structure being configured to automatically

initiate embedded terminal sessions with the central
exchange and one or more of the concentrators (3a-3c; A-E)

necessary for performing the macro and to execute the
command sequences required by each subtask.
A system according to claim 1, comprising means for
opening the terminal sessions with each target

system of the macro before the macro tasks are
started, and all of the connections established are

maintained in parallel during the execution of the
whole macro, and that before the tasks are started,

a network element status query command is run in
each system to ensure the connection and the status

of the network element.
A system according to claim 1 or 2, comprising means for
executing the macro commands in two steps in such a manner

that in the first step, all commands are run through in the 
different concentrators (3a-3c; A-E) without the

concentrators committing themselves to the changes required
by the commands until all concentrators have been gone

through, and in the second step, the concentrators (3a-3c;
A-E) commit themselves to the commands executed in the

first step.
A system according to claim 3, 
characterised in that

if the execution of a macro task fails in a concentrator in
the second step, the changes caused by the commands

executed in the first step are cancelled with regard to the
concentrator.
A system according to any of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 the system comprises a
concentrator specific transaction log which keeps a

register of the commands executed in each element and
attempts to execute the commands, whereby the log keeps a

record of commands which for some reason have not been
executed, and that the concentrator specific transaction

log is stored in an executable form, which can be run as
such, for the execution of commands that have not been

executed in the corresponding concentrators (3a-3c; A-E).
A system according to claim 5, 
characterised in that

the system comprises a buffer memory (6) for buffering
concentrator specific tasks, such as individual macro

commands, for subsequent execution, and operation states
controlling the further execution of delayed tasks.
A system according to claim 6, 
characterised by

comprising two operation states controlling further
execution of delayed tasks, one of them transferring the

commands to be run immediately as soon as possible, and the
other keeping the commands in a wait state until the system

operator issues an execution command.
