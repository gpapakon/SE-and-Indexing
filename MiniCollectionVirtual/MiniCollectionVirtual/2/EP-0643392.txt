<ABSTRACT>
A recording and/or reproducing apparatus which employs a disc (200, 201) as a 
recording medium and in which a recording and/or reproducing unit is supported in a 

floating state via plural damper units (14) and elastic members (61, 62). The recording 
and/or reproducing apparatus includes a recording and/or reproducing unit mounted on 

a base member (4) via plural damper units (14) and a closure member (700) rotatably 
mounted on the base member (4) for covering the recording and/or reproducing unit. 

Between the closure member (700) and the recording and/or reproducing unit, there is 
mounted a spring plate (61, 62) for biasing the recording and/or reproducing unit 

towards the base member (4). When the closure member (700) is at a position of 
sheathing said recording and/or reproducing unit, the recording and/or reproducing unit 

is maintained at a position in which the weight of the recording and/or reproducing 
unit, the elastic force of the damper means (14) and the elastic force of said first elastic 

member (61, 62) counterbalance one another. The damper unit (14) supporting the 
recording and/or reproducing unit on the base member (4) has a vibration absorbing 

member (334) and a further elastic member (333) fitted on the outer side of the 
vibration absorbing member (334). There is also provided a supporting member (55) on 

which is arranged the recording and/or reproducing unit. A further elastic member (67) 
constituting the damper unit is provided between the base member (4) and the 

supporting member (55) for biasing the recording and/or reproducing unit toward the 
closure member (700) against the bias of a spring plate (61, 62).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a recording and/or reproducing
apparatus employing a disc such as a magneto-optical disc or an
optical disc as a recording medium for information signals. More
particularly, it relates to such apparatus in which its recording
and/or reproducing unit is supported within a main body of the
apparatus in a floating state via a plurality of damper units and
elastic members.Up to now, a recording and/or reproducing apparatus
employing a recording medium such as a magneto-optical disc or
an optical disc for information signals has been proposed. The
magneto-optical disc or the optical disc, employed as a recording
medium for such recording and/or reproducing apparatus, is
contained in a main cartridge body to form a disc cartridge and
loaded in such state in the recording and/or reproducing
apparatus.The recording and/or reproducing apparatus has an optical
pickup and a magnetic head as means for writing and/or reading
information signals on or from the magnetic recording medium.
The optical pickup and the magnetic head are mounted on a chassis
provided in the main body of the apparatus to constitute a
recording and/or reproducing unit. On the other hand, the disc
cartridge having a disc cartridge having the magneto-optical disc
or the optical disc therein as a recording medium, is loaded at 
a cartridge loading position in the recording and/or reproducing
apparatus so as to be positioned relative to the recording and/or
reproducing unit provided in the recording and/or reproducing
apparatus. By the disc cartridge loaded at the cartridge loading
position, information signals are recorded on the magneto-optical
disc, with the aid of the optical pickup and a magnetic head, or
the information signals recorded on the magneto-optical disc or
the optical disc are reproduced.It is noted that, if impacts are applied to the main body
of the apparatus to produce vibrations in the recording and/or
reproducing unit, it becomes impossible to record or reproduce
information signals on or from the recording medium. That is, if
the recording and/or reproducing unit is subjected to vibrations,
the optical pickup is deviated in its position relative to the
recording medium, such that it becomes impossible for the light
beam radiated by the optical pickup to follow the recording track
formed on the recording medium, thus rendering it impossible to
record/reproduce information signals. Above all, when writing
information signals on the magneto-optical disc, the information
signals and table-of-contents
