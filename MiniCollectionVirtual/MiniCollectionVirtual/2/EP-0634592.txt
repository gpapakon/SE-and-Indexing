<ABSTRACT>
A motor vehicle having a manual transmission 
(16) includes means for indicating to the driver a 

point in operation for upshifting to the next higher 
gear from the present gear. The shift point is 

determined on the basis of actual operating parameters 
of the motor vehicle effecting current wheel torque 

and predicted wheel torque in the next higher gear. 
Calibration to a single value representing the ratio 

of predicted wheel torque to current wheel torque 
allows simple balancing between fuel economy and 

performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of
providing an indication of a required gear change in a
motor vehicle and to gear change indication apparatus.Gear change or shift indicators are commonly
used in manual transmission vehicles to assist
non-expert drivers in determining when it is
appropriate to shift the transmission to a higher gear
in order to maximise driving fuel economy. A system
calibrated such that absolute maximum fuel economy
would be obtained if a shift occurs at the point
indicated may exhibit a noticeable sag in axle torque
at the shift and therefore result in an unpleasant
shift feel to the driver. In such situations, drivers
quickly learn to ignore the shift indicator, thus
rendering it ineffective for its intended purpose of
maximising fuel economy. Fuel economy figures
required to be displayed on new vehicles for sale in
the United States are arrived at through a customer
usage weighting of the fuel economy obtained on
vehicles tested using the upshift indicator light and
fuel economy obtained without using the upshift
indicator light.Conventional shift indicator calibration
typically involves setting manifold absolute pressure
(MAP) thresholds at a variety of speeds. Such a
method can be time consuming and result in non-optimal
shift points. Additionally, as actual engine torque
changes due to spark retardation for control of engine
knock as may be practised in the engine control, the
calibrated shift points based on MAP thresholds may no
longer be appropriate, thereby exacerbating the
aforementioned axle torque sag and leading to driver
disregard of the shift indicator and reduced fuel
economy. EP-A-0512596 discloses a method in accordance with the
preamble of Claim 1.The present invention seeks to provide improved gear shift
indication.A method of providing a signal of a required gear change
according to the present invention is characterised over EP-A-0512596 by the
features specified in the characterising portion of claim 1.It is possible in preferred embodiments to balance the comfort
of the shift at the point indicated by the shift indicator with the fuel economy
benefits at the shift point since this will tend to result in higher driver usage,
higher actual fuel economy and higher fuel efficiency ratings for a particular
vehicle.It is also possible to adapt shift indication for actual engine
torque conditions, to simplify the calibration of a shift indicator and to allow
for flexible indexing of the indicator according to desired fuel economy versus
performance profiles.A
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of providing a signal of a required gear change in
a motor vehicle comprising the steps of calculating
 a torque ratio of a
predicted wheel torque for a next higher gear to a present wheel torque for the

engaged gear (450); comparing the torque ratio to a predetermined threshold
(532,533); and outputting a signal (339) when the torque ratio exceeds the

predetermined threshold; characterised in that the signal (339) provides an
indication of a required gear change; and in that the predetermined threshold

corresponds to a torque ratio intended to maximise fuel economy at the next
higher gear.
A method according to claim 1, wherein the predicted
wheel torque substantially corresponds to a maximum wheel torque.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the step of
calculating the torque ratio includes the steps of calculating a current engine

torque value for the engaged gear from predetermined engine parameters
(417); calculating a predicted engine torque value for the next higher gear

from the predetermined engine parameters (439); establishing a current wheel
torque value from the current engine torque value for the engaged gear and

the gear ratio corresponding thereto; and establishing a predicted wheel torque
value from the predicted engine torque value in the next higher gear and the

gear ratio corresponding thereto.
A method according to claim 3, wherein the predetermined
engine parameters include spark retard.
A method according to claim 3 or 4, wherein the
predetermined engine parameters include exhaust gas recirculation. 
A method according to claim 3, 4 or 5, wherein the
predetermined engine parameters include fuel composition.
