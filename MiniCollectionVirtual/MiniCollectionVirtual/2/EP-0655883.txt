<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a general-purpose lead
working machine useful in performing various working processes
such as lead forming in the fabrication of semiconductor
devices.The fabrication of plastic-molded semiconductor devices
includes the steps of placing semiconductor chips on to
leadframes, molding them with plastics and performing the
necessary working processes such as resin removal, dam bar
cutting, lead tip cutting and lead forming. The lead working
machine is used at this post-die-processing stage to perform
lead forming and various other working steps.The lead working machine is usually operated with more
than one die. The working operation is performed in two
different ways: in one case, the leadframe is worked as it is
transported in a strip form and piece parts are separated from
it at the final stage and in the other case, lead cutting and
dam bar cutting are first conducted and then the product
portions are separated as piece parts from the leadframe and
transported to the bending step. The primary reason for
adopting these two different methods of transport is as 
follows: in the case where the leadframe is transported in a
strip form, a simple transport apparatus will do since the top
and bottom rails of the leadframe can be utilized as transport
guides; however, with product portions that are not suspended
from the top and bottom rails by means of hanger pins (i.e.,
pinch leads for suspending the packages) or with products that
are suspended by means of hanger pins but which may drop during
transport owing to the insufficient strength of the pins,
transport of the leadframe for bending or otherwise working the
leads is sometimes impossible unless it is separated into piece
parts.Figs. 19, 20 and 21 are illustrations showing the
layout of a prior art lead working machine. Fig. 19 shows an
apparatus that performs working processes up to the bending
stage as a leadframe in a strip form is fed consecutively with
pins inserted into the rail holes in the leadframe. In this
apparatus, the leadframe generally indicated by 5 is worked as
it is supplied from the left side of the apparatus into a first
die 7 and a second die 8 on a platform 6. A feed unit 10 which
allows the leadframe to be fed consecutively with pins inserted
into the rail holes is positioned parallel to the train of
dies. In the final step following the bending process, piece
parts 11 are separated from the product, transported from the
second die and replaced in a receiving portion 12. The
unwanted frame which
