<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a gas-shielded-arc welding apparatus having a metal nozzle body guiding a welding wire, a sleeve surrounding the nozzle body at a distance, and a protective body attached to the open end of the sleeve or formed in one piece with the sleeve, the protective body having an end wall which has a single opening of such a diameter that the simultaneous discharge of the welding wire and a shielding gas becomes possible.

<CLAIMS>
A shield gas welding apparatus including a metallic
nozzle body (5) guiding a welding wire, a sleeve (9) surrounding

the body in spaced relationship, and a protective
body (15, 15') mounted at the open end (11) of the sleeve (9)

or formed integrally therewith and having an end wall (17),
characterised in that the end wall (17) has a single opening

(21) of a diameter that permits the welding wire and a shield
gas to pass simultaneously therethrough.
The apparatus of claim 1, characterised in that the protective
body (15) is non-metallic.
The apparatus of claim 2, characterised in that the protective
body (15) is made of a boron nitride composite ceramic

material containing oxide and/or carbide.
The apparatus of claim 1, characterised in that the protective
body (15') is metallic and preferably formed integrally

with the sleeve (9).
The apparatus of claim 4, characterised in that a water
cooling (23) is located next to the inner wall of the sleeve

(9).
The apparatus of claim 5, characterised in that the
water cooling (23) is in the form of a reflux cooling.
The apparatus of any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised
in that the diameter of the opening (21) is smaller than or

equal to the diameter of the nozzle body (5).
The apparatus of any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised
in that the diameter of the opening (21) is larger than the

diameter of the nozzle body (5).
