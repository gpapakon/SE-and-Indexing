<ABSTRACT>
The operation of a catalytic metal oxide reactor (24) is described which is capable of the complete mineralization of a gaseous stream including several organic pollutants. Several of the reaction constraints individually improve reaction completion and combinations of these factors permit complete degradation of the input gaseous contaminants in a manner not demonstrated previously. The factors include the nature and physical form of the catalyst, the lowering of the humidity in the input gaseous stream, the heating of the input gas stream and the reactor (24), and increasing the space time of the reactants in the reactor (24) beyond that necessary to degrade the initial contaminants.

<DESCRIPTION>
 GAS PHASE DEGRADATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDSStatement Regarding Federally Sponsored ResearchThis invention was made with United States Government support awarded by the Department of Energy (DOE), Grant No. PO AX0798826-1. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.Field of the InventionThis invention relates to the field of detoxification of inorganic and organic pollutants, and in particular to the field of gas phase, catalytic photo-oxidation of pollutants.Background of the InventionCeramic membranes are used currently in industry and science for a variety of processes and purposes, the most common of which involve separation processes, catalysis, and adsorption. Ceramic membranes have increased in popularity because they offer several advantages over organic membranes. Ceramic membranes have a greater chemical stability since they are resistant to organic solvents, chlorine, and extremes of pH. Ceramic membranes are also stable at very high temperatures which allows for efficient sterilization of process and pharmaceutical equipment often not possible with organic membranes. 

Because ceramic membranes are inorganic, they are generally quite stable to microbial or biological degradation which can occasionally be a problem with organic membranes. Ceramic membranes are also mechanically very stable even under high pressures. The temperature, chemical, and mechanical stability of ceramic membranes allows them to be cleaned more effectively than other less durable membrane compositions.One of the desirable attributes of many metal oxides formed of transition metals is that the transition metal can have catalytic properties desirable for certain photochemical or electrophotochemical reactions. These materials are also effective adsorbents. Metal oxide porous ceramic materials thus are potentially attractive candidates for use as catalytic or adsorbent agents in industrial scale chemical reactions.Metal oxide ceramic materials are generally created through what is referred to as a sol-gel procedure. In such a procedure, the metal alkoxide is initiated into solution in a solvent, in a reaction vessel in which the solvent is rapidly being stirred. Depending on the process, the solvent may be alcoholic or aqueous. Whichever solvent is used, the metal alkoxide in solution is then hydrolyzed to create metal hydroxide monomers, dimers, polymers and/or particles depending on the quantity of water used. The hydrolyzing metal oxide particles in the solution tend to aggregate and to readily
