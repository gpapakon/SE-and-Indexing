<ABSTRACT>
An article of headwear (10) includes a solid transparent fully carbonate block (18). The block lies on top of the wearer's head and defines a non-straight light path to the wearer's eyes. The block does not obscure the majority of the normal field of vision for the wearer but can be seen when the wearer looks upwards. The upper surfaces (24) of the block allow internal reflection of light through the block and the rear end of the block is open and faces backwards so that by looking upwardly into the block a wearer can obtain a view of what is behind him. The article of headwear may be a motorcycle helmet for example. In another embodiment of the invention a display screen is located at the rear of the block so that it can be seen through the block when the wearer looks upwardly into the block.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an article of headwear.Articles of headwear are known in the form of
motorcycle helmets allowing the wearer to see
backwards. However, these helmets incorporate
individual convex lenses and flat mirrors to direct
light through air. The lenses and mirrors being
arranged often approximately radically to a wearer's
head may cause damage on impact to the helmet by
presenting a low surface area of applied load to the
head.FR 2631789 discloses a helmet with an open, hollow
channel through the helmet over the wearer's head.
The helmet has two mirrors on the upper side of the
channel and one mirror on the lower side of the
channel. The mirrors direct light from behind a
wearer to the wearer's eyes.EP 0007432 discloses a helmet including a series of
convex lenses and an optical fibre in the helmet to
enable a wearer to see behind themselves. Three of
the lenses are arranged radially to the wearer's head.
The slim optical fibre is on slim radial mountings.
The channel through the helmet is hollow and open to 
air.A further helmet is known from US-A-3 059 519, in which a display
is provided, along with non-straight path means allowing a user
to see the display. According to one aspect of the invention there is
provided an article of headwear, the article not
obscuring the majority of the normal field of vision
for the wearer, characterised in that the article
includes path means through the article, the path
means defining a non-straight light path to the
wearer's eyes, the path means through the article
being at least 75% continuous and comprising at least
one transparent block.Preferably the path means is at least 90% continuous,
most preferably entirely continuous.Preferably the path means comprises a single
transparent block.In this way, the article of headwear does not include
potentially dangerous radially arranged optical
elements. The inner surface of the body may be shaped to follow
the approximate contour of at least part of a wearer's
head. In this way any applied impact will be spread
by the body over a larger surface area of the wearer's
head.Preferably the continuous body is the entire path
means. The or each block or the body may be made from
any suitable material. Preferably the material has
substantial toughness and the material may be
polycarbonate.The article of headwear may be a protective helmet
such as a motor cycle helmet. In that case the path
means may be provided inside or outside a shell of the
helmet but preferably lies inside the shell. The
article of headwear
