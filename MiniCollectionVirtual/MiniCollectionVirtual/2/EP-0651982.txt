<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a mask intended to be interposed in a laser beam in order to apply a determined treatment, in particular surface ablation, to an organ or an object, in particular a cornea, a lens or a corneal implant, as well as a method and a device employing such a mask. This mask (18) has, in addition to a region (44) which is opaque to the wavelength of the laser beam, a region (43) which is transparent to this wavelength, designed so as to form a fractal set. This mask (18) may, in particular, find its application in refractive surgery, for correcting myopia or hyperopia (hypermetropia) with or without astigmatism or for carrying out ablations with constant depth, and it may also be used for surface machining of any sort of object, and in particular optical lenses of natural or synthetic origin.
