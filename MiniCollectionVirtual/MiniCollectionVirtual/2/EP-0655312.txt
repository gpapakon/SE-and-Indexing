<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for producing pipes or hoses from a hollow strand of thermoplastic material, comprising a film blowing die, which has at least one connected extruder, feeding in the polymer material, and at least one mandrel, arranged in the barrel of the said extruder, there being formed at least between the mandrel and the barrel a flow space for the hollow strand, to which space the polymer material is fed via at least one heart-shaped groove, permits a more uniform distribution of the material and consequently improved hollow strands if the run-out regions (19,20) of the channel branches (15,16) of the heart-shaped-groove distributor overlap one another in the manner of a spiral mandrel distributor.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for producing pipes or hoses from thermoplastic
material, consisting of a blow head (1) which has at least one

connected extruder feeding the plastic material and at least
one mandrel or spreader sleeve (8) located in its housing (2),

whereby a flow space or annular gap (9, 11) for the hollow
strand is formed at least between the mandrel (8) and the

housing (2), to which strand the plastic material is fed via at
least one cardioid (17) of a cardioid spreader,
characterized in that

each cardioid (17) is composed of two channel branches (15,
16) located offset by 180° at one and the same mandrel or

spreader sleeve (8), wound in the same direction round the
mandrel or spreader sleeve (8), with overlapping discharge

areas (19, 20) in the nature of a helical spreader. 
Apparatus according to claim 1,
characterized in that

a first helical-type cardioid spreader with overlapping channel
branches (15, 16) is integrated into a first spreader sleeve (8)

concentrically enveloping a tie rod (7), and a second helical-type
cardioid spreader with overlapping channel branches

(15, 16) into a second spreader sleeve (10) concentrically
enclosing the first spreader sleeve (8) while forming an annular

gap or flow space (9).
Apparatus according to claim 2,
characterized in that

the two helically formed cardioid spreaders are offset from
each other by 180°.
