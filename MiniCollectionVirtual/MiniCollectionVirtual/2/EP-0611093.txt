<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
knee brace having good stability. Whilst the knee brace is primarily intended for 
orthopaedic use, the brace may be used as a prophylactic 
device for use in sport, for example, in skiing and 
wherein two joint means are provided one either side of 
the knee joint. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an improved knee brace wherein the lateral 
stability is enhanced and preferably one wherein the 
movement more closely proximates that of a knee joint. According to the present invention there is 
provided an improved knee brace comprising upper and 
lower leg-engaging/embracing parts (thigh and calf 
pieces) connectable around upper and lower parts of the 
leg above and below the knee joint with the upper and 
lower leg embracing parts having upper and lower brace 
members respectively interconnected by at least one 
joint means, characterised by the feature that said 
joint means each comprises at least one link member 
pivotally connected to each of said brace members for 
holding said brace members together, wherein first and 
second gear means are provided on the upper and lower 
brace members and lie on arcs with the arc of the upper 
brace member having a smaller radius than the arc of the 
lower member and the gear means are such that the upper 
brace member rotates at a faster angular velocity than 
the lower so as to closely resemble the movement of a 
knee joint.  Also according to the present invention there is 
provided an improved knee brace comprising upper and 
lower leg-engaging/embracing parts (thigh and calf 
pieces) connectable around upper and lower parts of the 
leg above and below the knee joint with the upper and 
lower leg embracing parts having upper and lower brace 
members respectively interconnected by at least one 
joint means, characterised by the feature that said 
joint means each comprises at least one link member 
pivotally connected to each of said brace members for 
holding such together, wherein the end region of the 
normally upper brace member has a slot or passage 
therein defined between two arm portions of said member 
and in which slot a first gear means is provided 
comprising a series of cross members, preferably in the 
form of short cylinders or pins, arranged on an arc on a 
first radius which does not extend beyond the end of 
said upper member and wherein the end region of the 
lower brace member is provided with a second gear means 
formed as a series of recesses cooperably receiving said 
cro

slot and pin action. 
A brace as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 3, in

such forming the gear means portions are not in rolling 
abutment. 
A brace as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 5, in
