<ABSTRACT>
An electrostatic discharge (hereafter referred to as 
"ESD") protection device is disclosed for use with 

semiconductor chip packaging (hereafter referred to as 
"SCP". The electrostatic protection device comprises 

electrically conductive shorting devices (186) that may be 
removably connected to the SCP during the manufacture to 

short selected pins (22') from the SCP. The ESD protection 
devices remain in place to provide ESD protection during 

all phases of handling and shipping and may be manually 
removed during final assembly when the SCP is installed in 

its end product.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrostatic discharge
(hereafter referred to as "ESD") protection device for
various semiconductor chip packages (hereinafter referred
to as "SCP") of the type having a plurality of connector
pins which are either (a) continuously shorted and then,
upon insertion of the connector pins into complementary
receptacles, automatically unshorted or (b) continuously
shorted until the physical removal of the ESD protection
device from the SCP.For a plurality of connector pins of a SCP which mates
with a corresponding plurality of receptacles in a
connector, typically, a printed circuit board, it is
frequently necessary to short together the connector pins
of the SCP until they are inserted into complementary
receptacles in the connector in order to protect the
semiconductor's circuity from ESD. Present ESD protection
devices consist primarily of ESD packaging of the SCP in
electrically conductive strips, pellets, boxes and plastic
tubing which provides effective ESD protection until the
user is about to insert the connector pins of the SCP into
the complementary receptacles in the connector. At that
point, however, the user must remove this ESD packaging
from the SCP, thus rendering the SCP vulnerable to ESD, in
order to position and insert the connector pins into the
receptacles. Accordingly, as the user inserts the
connector pins of the SCP into the receptacles, the
semiconductor dies housed within these SCP's could be
destroyed by ESD and would have to be replaced. Moreover,
certain types of SCPs typically EPROMs, UVPROMS, and DRAMs,
are plug-in devices which have connector pins which are
repeatedly inserted into and then removed from the
receptacles. These types of SCPs require ESD protection
during the repeated insertions into and removals from the
receptacles. Specifically, the connector pins of these
SCPs require ESD protection from the moment that their
connector pins are removed from the receptacles till their 
connector pins are again inserted therein. Consequently,
a need still exists within the semiconductor chip packaging
industry for a true ESD protection device, rather than ESD
packaging, which effectively protects the semiconductor die
from ESD until the connector pins of the SCP are inserted
into the receptacles of the connector and then protects the
semiconductor die from ESD again when the connector pins
are removed form their respective receptacles.DE-OS-2348630 describes a method and device for
protecting devices from damage due to electrostatic charges

<CLAIMS>
An electrostatic discharge protection device (182) in combination
with a semiconductor chip package (12') of the type

having a top surface (14') and opposite bottom surface
(16') and a pair of interface surfaces (18', 20') disposed

between the top and bottom surfaces, each interface surface
having a plurality of connector pins (22') disposed thereon

in a substantially parallel and spaced apart relationship
with respect to each other, each connector pin having a

portion extending outward from the interface surface and
downward at its distal end so as to extend beyond the

bottom surface, the electrostatic discharge protection
device including:


a) a base section (184) having a planar surface
overl
aid on and secured to the top surface of the
semiconductor chip package;
b) a plurality of shorting arms (186) integral to
the base section and extending outward therefrom in spaced

apart relationship with respect to each other, each
shorting arm being in electrical engagement with a

connector pin for shorting between the plurality of
connector pins via the shorting arms and the base section,

each shorting arm having at least a first portion (198)
integral to the base section and extending outwardly and

downwardly therefrom to define a transverse edge
portion (200) at its distal end, the edge portion being

moveable into engagement with respect to a
respective connector pin;

   characterised in that slots (202) bifurcate select
shorting arms so as to separate a pair of lateral edge

portions within each select shorting arm from each other, thereby providing each adjacent transverse edge portion (200) with the ability to move independently of the other so as to independently engage the first portion (198) of the connector pin (22').
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that
the base section further comprises a stiffening rib

disposed integrally within the base section, the stiffening
rib (192) having end portions which extend beyond the

opposite end portions of the base section, each end portion 
of the stiffening rib defining a tab (194,196) which can be

gripped so that the electrostatic discharge protection
device can be easily removed from the top surface.
A device according to claim 1 or claim 2,
characterised by an adhesive for securely mounting the base

section to the semiconductor chip package.
A device according to claim 1 or claim 2,
characterised by end portions extending from opposite ends

of the base section and integral therewith, each end
portion defining a clip (188,190) which can be removably

secured around the top and bottom surfaces of the
semiconductor chip package so that the base section is

securely mounted to the semiconductor chip package.
