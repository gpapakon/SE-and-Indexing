<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to (1) a method of
identifying an individual at an increased risk for
developing cancer, (2) a method for determining a
prognosis of patients afflicted with cancer, and (3) a
method for determining the proper course of treatment for
a patient afflicted with cancer.Lung cancer claims more lives in the United
States than any other neoplasm (R.S. Finley, Am. Pharm.
NS29, 39 (1989)), and of the various forms lung
adenocarcinomas have one of the worst prognoses (T.P.
Miller, Semin. Oncol. 17, 11 (1990)). The incidence of
adenocarcinoma of the lung (ACL) in the United States is
also quickly rising (I. Linnoila, Hematol. Oncol. North.
Am. 4, 1027 (1990); J.B. Sorensen, H.H. Hansen, Cancer
Surviv. 8, 671 (1989)). In order to gain insight into
this complex and deadly disease, a model system for its
study has been developed. For such a model to provide
clinically relevant data several criteria must be met.
The tumors produced should be histologically equivalent to
their human counterparts, tumor induction must be reliable
and reproducible, and the numbers generated must be great
enough to provide statistical significance. To satisfy
these conditions a system has been created which uses two
inbred mouse strains (NFS/n and AKR) along with 
transplacental exposure to the potent carcinogen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea
(ENU) and promotion with the antioxidant
butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). The resulting tumors were
examined for altered expression or structural mutations of
genes implicated in lung tumor development such as ras
myc, and raf oncogenes (C.D. Little et al., Nature 306,
194 (1983); P.E. Kiefer et al., Cancer Res., 47, 6236
(1987); E. Santos et al., Science 223, 661 (1984); S.
Rodenhuis, N. Enal. J. Med. 317, 929 (1987); M. Barbacid,
Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 20, 225 (1990); U.R. Rapp et al., J.
Int. Assoc. for the Study of Lun Cancer 4, 162 (1988);
M.J. Birrer et al., Ann. Rev. Med. 40, 305 (1989); G.
Sithanandam et al., Oncogene 4, 451 (1989)).raf proto-oncogenes are evolutionarily highly
conserved genes encoding cytoplasmic serine/threonine
specific kinases, which function in mitogen signal
transduction (reviewed in U.R. Rapp et al., The Oncogene
Handbook, T. Curran et al., Eds. (Elsevier Science
Publishers, The Netherlands, 1988), pp. 115-154; U.R.
Rapp, Oncogene 6, 495 (1991)). The three known active
members in the raf family encode phosphoproteins of
similar size (72/74 kD for Raf-1; 68 kD for A-Raf-1, and
74 kD for B-Raf (U.R. Rapp et al., in Retroviruses and
Human Pathology, R.
