<ABSTRACT>
An environmentally protected electrical socket (20) and plug (50) assembly retains environmental security throughout repeated connections and disconnections. The socket and plug assembly includes a socket containing an electrical conductor and adapted to insertably receive a plug, an environmental sealant (90) at least partially filling the socket so that the sealant is at least partially displaced from the socket when the plug is inserted into the socket, and an elastomeric containment means (30) for containing displaced sealant when the plug is inserted into the socket and for urging the sealant back into the socket when the plug is removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of
electrical connectors, especially for telephone
communication equipment, and more particularly to
environmentally protected electrical connections. Most
particularly, in one embodiment the present invention
provides a method and apparatus for protecting telephone
jacks from moisture and corrosion, such as often found in
coastal regions, islands, and the like.Telephone line connections at subscriber
locations are commonly made with the RJ11 type of plug
and socket connector. These connectors are exemplary of
electrical connections susceptible to failure from
oxidation, corrosion, humidity, salt, and the like,
especially in the presence of a live voltage on the
conductors within the connector.For example, it is sometimes difficult to
establish and maintain an adequate environmental seal in
a removable male RJ11 plug, particularly when wires lead
from the male RJ11 plug. Accordingly, moisture and other
environmental contaminants are allowed to enter such
plugs, sometimes resulting in corrosion and/or failure of
the connection of the tip and ring connections in the
socket/plug combination. RJ11 sockets are likewise
subject to moisture contamination and corrosion, as well
as being subject to dust buildup. In hot, humid 
environments such as in Florida and along the Gulf Coast of Texas, failure can occur
within several months of installation. Servicing these failures is costly for the
consumer or the telephone company.Sometimes problems have also arisen in connection with test ports for
customer telecommunications equipment such as remote terminals at customer
facilities, described in the parent application, and the like. It is often desirable to
provide an RJ11 connector of the type well known to those of skill in the art, or other
such connector, at an external location at subscriber facilities such as a junction box
leading to a house or a remote terminal of the type described above. Previously, such
access is provided by installing a female RJ11 socket at such locations which is
normally connected to a male RJ11 plug. The tip and ring wires (among other wires
in some cases) lead from the female RJ11 socket, and connect to tip and ring
connections in the male RJ11 plug, thereafter leading into the subscriber facility.
When it is desired to connect test equipment to the RJ11 female socket, the plug is
removed, and another male RJ11 is inserted into the female socket, thereby providing
tip and ring connections for the test equipment. Even though the equipment may

<CLAIMS>
An environmentally sealed electrical connector receptacle (10), comprising:

(a) a socket (20) capable of receiving an electrical plug (50) and forming an
electrical connection therewith upon insertion of the plug into the socket;
(b) an environmental sealant (70) disposed within the socket;
(c) an elastomeric diaphragm (30) expandable to receive any sealant displaced
by insertion of the plug and providing sufficient force opposing

displacement to seal the inserted plug; and
(d) at least one passage (30c) within the diaphragm;

characterised in that:

(e) the elastomeric diaphragm (30) is mounted to the socket (20) opposite a
side of the socket capable of receiving the plug (50); and
(f) at least one wire (45) passes through said at least one passage (30c) and
connects with said socket (20).
The electrical connector receptacle (10) of claim 1, wherein said
environmental sealant (70) comprises silicone gel.
The electrical connector receptacle (10) of claim 1, wherein said socket (20)
further comprises at least one electrical contact (40) having a front portion coated with

a silicone rubber adhesive (100), said contact connected to said at least one wire (45). 
The electrical connector receptacle (10) of claim 1, further including an
expansion slot (80) in communication with said socket.
The electrical connector receptacle (10) of claim 4, further including a
displacement insert (90) within said expansion slot (80).
The electrical connector receptacle (10) of claim 1, wherein said
environmental sealant (70) has a Voland hardness of about 25 g to about 35

g.
The electrical connector receptacle (10) of claim 1, wherein said
environmental sealant (70) has a tack of about 12 g to about 22 g.
The electrical connector receptacle (10) of claim 1, wherein said
environmental sealant (70) comprises material selected from the group of aliphatic

urethanes and styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrenes.
The electrical connector receptacle (10) of claim 1, wherein said elastomeric
diaphragm has a Shore A hardness from about 45 g to about 75 g.
A method of sealing an electrical socket and plug connector, the socket
capable of receiving the plug in a region at a side of the socket, said method

comprising the steps of:

(a) attaching an elastomeric diaphragm to the socket opposite the side of the
socket capable of receiving the plug, the diaphragm being in communication

with the region for receiving the plug;
(b) depositing a sufficient amount of gel sealing material within the socket
whereby upon insertion of the plug into the socket, gel sealing material is 

displaced into the elastomeric diaphragm causing the diaphragm to
expand, said diaphragm thus providing an urging back pressure on the gel

sealing material to seal the socket and plug connection.
The method of claim 10, wherein the step of depositing gel sealing material
comprises the steps of:


(a) releasably mounting said socket, having the diaphragm attached thereto,
on a gel filling fixture;
(b) depositing uncured silicone gel sealing material within said socket and
diaphragm;
(c) curing said silicone gel sealing material within said socket; and
(d) removing said socket from said gel filling fixture.
