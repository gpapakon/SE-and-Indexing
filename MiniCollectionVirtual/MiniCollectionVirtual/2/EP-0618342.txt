<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to wellbore lock
systems and to methods and apparatus for their use in tubular
members disposed within a wellbore; and more particularly relates
to such wellbore lock systems of a design particularly useful in
relatively large or "full bore" applications.Many types of locks are known for use in engaging tubular
members within a wellbore, and for facilitating flow control
operations or the placement of other equipment in the wellbore.
Of particular interest are wellbore locks which can engage a
relatively large, or "full bore", nipple within a string of
casing or other tubular member (such as tubing, drill string,
work string, etc.). A current trend in the drilling of wells is
that of "slim hole drilling", which entails the drilling of the
smallest diameter hole which is feasible. The subsequent
performing of operations in such an operation requires that any
restrictions in the casing, such as seal bores, nipples, etc.,
be minimal, and that the largest possible bore be maintained
through the tubular string.Typically, locks are run into the wellbore on either
wireline or slickline. To facilitate this running-in process,
it is desirable that the lock configuration provide minimal drag
against the tubular string as the lock is inserted within the
string. It is also desirable that the lock be capable of being
set relatively simply, and therefore relatively inexpensively.Conventional locks suitable for full bore applications,
however, have included engagement members (commonly known as
"latching dogs"), which will locate recesses within a profile or 
nipple by riding, or "dragging" against the interior of the tubular string as
the lock is placed in the wellbore, and thereby engaging the recesses as
the latching dogs pass through the profile. Additionally, such
conventional locks typically include stationary sealing elements, such as
conventional chevron-type seals, which will sealingly engage the profile.
However, locks with such a sealing arrangement inherently require a
reduced diameter section within the profile to facilitate establishing a
sealing engagement with the lock, and thereby present an undesirable flow
restriction within the tubular string.In US-A-4116277 there is described a downhole assembly
comprising a lock assembly for a wellbore which comprises a housing
assembly; an actuation assembly operatively associated with said housing
assembly and movable in relation to said housing assembly; at least one
engagement member coupled to said housing assembly,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A lock assembly for a wellbore which comprises a housing
assembly (14); and actuation assembly (28,72) operatively associated

with said housing assembly (14) and movable in relation to said housing
assembly (14); at least one engagement member (24) coupled to said

housing assembly (14), the or each engagement member being movable
from a first position wherein the or each engagement member is

substantially radially retracted relative to said housing assembly, to a
second position wherein the or each engagement member is operatively

extended relative to said housing assembly; and a sealing assembly (78)
coupled to said housing assembly, said sealing assembly comprising an

expandable seal element (80) having an interior surface, said sealing
assembly operatively associated with said actuation assembly to facilitate

radial expansion of said interior surface of said seal element upon
predetermined movement of said actuation assembly, wherein said

actuation assembly includes a first sleeve (28) which is movable from a
first position to a second position, said sleeve operatively coupled to the

or each engagement member to facilitate movement of the or each
engagement member from s
aid first, substantially radially retracted
position, when said sleeve is in said first position, to said second,

operatively extended position, when said sleeve is in said second position,
characterised in that said sleeve is further movable to a third position

wherein said sleeve is proximate the or each engagement member to
secure the or each engagement member in said operatively extended

position, and in that said sealing assembly further comprises an
expandable backup member (82) having an interior surface, said interior

surface of the backup member (82) being arranged to radially expand upon
said predetermined movement of said actuation assembly. 
A lock assembly according to claim 1, wherein said actuation
assembly (28,72) is longitudinally movable in relation to said housing

assembly (14).
A lock assembly according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said at
least one engagement member (24) is movable from a first position

wherein said engagement member is radially retracted substantially
entirely within the outer diameter of said housing assembly (14), to a

second position.
A lock assembly according to claim 1, 2 or 3, further
comprising a second expandable backup member (82) coupled to said

housing assembly (14) proximate said expandable seal element (80), said
second expandable backup member also operatively associated with said

actuation assembly to facilitate radial expansion of both said backup
members upon predetermined movement of said actuation assembly

(28,72).
A lock assembly adapted to traverse an assembly of tubular
members disposed in a wellbore and to selectively engage a profile

including recesses installed within said tubular member assembly, which
lock assembly comprises a housing assembly (14); an actuation assembly

movable relation thereto; a plurality of engagement members (24)

operatively coupled to said housing assembly, said engagement members
movable from a first position wherein said engagement members are

substantially radially retracted relative to said housing assembly and
facilitate traversal of said lock through said tubular member assembly, to

extended relative to said housing assembly to operatively engage said

recesses in said profile; an annular seal element (80) operatively
associated with said housing assembly and said actuation assembly, said

annular seal element movable from a first condition wherein the exterior
diameter of said seal element facilitates the traversal of said lock through

said tubular member assembly, to a second condition wherein the exterior
diameter of said seal element is expanded to sealingly engage said profile,

said association of said seal element with said actuation assembly

said seal element through longitudinal movement of said actuation
assembly relative to said housing assembly, wherein said actuation

assembly comprises a first sleeve (28) which is movable from a first
position to a second position, said sleeve operatively coupled to said

element actuation sleeve having a section of a first relatively smaller
diameter which is radially proximate said annular seal element (80) when
