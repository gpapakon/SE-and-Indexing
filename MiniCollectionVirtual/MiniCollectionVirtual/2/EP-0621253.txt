<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a cyclopentenone by 
forming a two-phase mixture of a 1,4-diketone, a water 

immiscible organic solvent, and an aqueous base solution, 
and heating the mixture so as to convert the 1,4-diketone 

to a cyclopentenone which collects in the organic solvent 
phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
This process relates to the preparation
of 3-methylcyclopent-2-en-1-one
from a 1,4-diketone.Cyclopentenones are useful compounds for
preparing hydrocarbyl substituted cyclopentadienes which
can be reacted with transition metal salts to form
metallocene catalysts for olefin polymerization. It is
known to make cyclopentenones, such as 3-methylcyclopent-2-en-1-one,
by heating a 1,4-diketone, such as acetonylacetone,
with base, such as NaOH. The product is unstable
in the presence of base. Consequently, either care must be
taken to avoid excessive tar formation or the product must
be removed as it is formed, for example, by distillation as
described in U.S. Patent No. 3,907,896. U.S.-P-5,276,199 relates to a process for preparing a cyclopentenone by forming a two-phase
mixture of a 1,4-diketone, a water immiscible organic solvent and an aqueous base
solution and heating the mixtures so as to convert 1,4-diketone to a cyclopentenone
which collects in the organic solvent base. We have now discovered an improved process for
preparing 3-methylcyclopent-2-en-1-one, which can be carried out at
lower temperatures and does not involve the contemporaneous
removal of product from the reaction mixture. This invention
also provides a practical process in which the
reactor-loading can be 5-10 times higher than in the
process according to the above mentioned patent.In accordance with this invention there is
provided a process for preparing 3-methylcyclopent-2-en-1-one, which
process comprises forming a two-phase mixture of acetonylacetone,
a water immiscible organic solvent and an aqueous
base solution, and heating the mixture
to a temperature of from 50 to 100°C so as to convert the
acetonylacetone to 3-methylcyclopent-2-en-1-one which collects in the
organic solvent phase. The 1,4-diketone reactants for use in the process
of the invention can be prepared as known in the art, for
example, see Rosini G. et al. Tetrahedron, 39 (24) 4127-32
(1983).The reaction mixture is a two-phase system which
includes an aqueous phase and an organic solvent phase.The aqueous phase comprises an aqueous solution
of a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide solution, for
example, sodium or potassium hydroxide. Preferably, sodium
hydroxide is used in amounts to provide a 0.5 to 5 molar
aqueous NaOH solution.The organic solvent phase comprises a substantially
water immiscible organic solvent, preferably hydrocarbyl
or hydrocarbyl halide solvents and mixtures thereof
having a boiling point of from 25 to 250°C. Non-limiting
examples of solvents
