<ABSTRACT>
The method for obtaining expulsion tubulars where 
are guided the corresponding expellers used in moulds, for 

example injection moulds, comprises a series of operations 
which are carried out on a tube (1), the first operation 

consisting in cutting a portion of the tube (1) to the desired 
length, with an excess of diameter to allow for an eventual 

grinding. In a second phase, a reduction of diameter is 
carried out in an extreme region (2), in order to proceed, 

in a third phase, to an external pre-grinding (3), the fourth 
phase consisting in an internal machining of the extreme 

region (2) with a total concentricity. In the fifth phase, 
an inductive tempering is effected, and continuously, in 

a sixth phase, an external grinding is performed in order 
to obtain the desired external diameter, the seventh phase 

consisting in an internal grinding on the internal diameter 
of the area (2), and finally the eighth phase consists in a 

frontal facing (6), thereby obtaining an expulsion tubular 
(1) for moulds, in general. Optionally, a swaged head may 

be obtained at the posterior extremity of the tubular (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a procedure for making an ejector 
tube for moulds in general, though it is intended for 
application in particular with injection moulds, the 
procedure being based on a series of stages of work carried 
out on a length of tubing of suitable length and diameter, 
this tubing being the starting point in achieving, through 
the minimum number of operations, the shaping of the 
ejector tube which serves as the guide for the ejectors 
used in moulds, with both the ejector tube and the ejector 
being held in place by a fixing head. The ejector tubes used as guides for ejectors linked to 
their fixing heads and included in injection moulds are 
conventionally produced from a bar or rod which is 
subjected to a series of processes: first, one of the ends 
is worked to produce the head, which is oversized with 
respect to the rest of the body; next, an axial bore is cut 
all the way through, and then suitably machined to give two 
diameters; it is then trued, and further operations such as heat 
treatment and subsequent truing are performed until the ejector tube 
sought is obtained. As stated, in producing the ejector tube in the 
conventional manner, the starting point is a solid bar 
which, since its bore has to be drilled out, entails a loss 
of material, and furthermore this bar initially is very 
heavy. For example, to produce a standard ejector tube 
measuring 400 mm in length with a bore diameter of 8 mm and  
 
an outside diameter of 12 mm, the starting point is a bar 
of metal whose total weight is approximately 1,290 grams. Furthermore, special machine tools are needed to produce 
it. As a consequence of all this, fourteen to sixteen 
different operations have to be performed - a long and 
laborious process. It must also be borne in mind that, since material has to 
be removed to produce the bore, molecules will be broken, 
thereby reducing elasticity in the mechanical strength of 
the end product. Another physical problem which cannot be eliminated arises 
during the heat treatment, since the various molecular 
masses which make up the product have varying thicknesses, 
and this makes the cooling stage in the hardening fragile, 
plastic deformations arising which require a special, 
additional truing process. Finally, it must be pointed out that, in conventionally 
produced ejector tubes, when the tube has to be cut to 
length, the cut has to be made at the upper end, since 
naturally this operation is performed after attaching the 
piece to the appropriate fixing head;

A manufacturing procedure for making an ejector tube for 
moulds which, taking a length of a tube (1) as the starting 

point, consists of the following operating stages: 

cutting the tube (1) to the desired length, with the 
inside and outside diameters slightly oversized with 

respect to the final diameters; 
deforming one end section (2) of the tube (1), from the 
outside in, to reduce the inside diameter of that end section 

(2); 
pre-truing of the outside (3) to bring the diameter of 
the tube (1) down to the desired value; 
machining the inside of the deformed end section (2), 
ensuring total concentricity; 
treating the tube (1) by induction hardening; 
external truing (4) of the tube (1) to bring its diameter 
to the desired value; 
internal truing (5) of the diameter of the deformed end section 
(2) to obtain the diameter desired for this end section; 
truing the front end (6) of the deformed end section (2), 
with optional nitriding;
 
and a final complete check of the tube thus obtained. 
A manufacturing procedure for making an ejector tube for 
moulds, as in claim 1, characterized in that optionally, 

between the seventh and eighth stages of the previous 
claim, a butt (7) may be heat-formed on the rear end of the  

 
tube (1), this operation being performed by compression, 

with the tube heated by induction, to obtain a pre-established 
circular shape (8) by means of a mould of the 

appropriate shape.
