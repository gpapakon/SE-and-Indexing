<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to coating compositions which are suitable for the production of pigmented or transparent top coats, based on hydroxy-functional (meth)acrylic copolymers, aliphatic and/or cycloaliphatic polyisocyanates, solvents and optionally additives and pigments which are conventional in coating compositions (paints, enamels, varnishes, lacquers). They are free from epoxy resins and nitrocellulose and contain, as binder (vehicle),   A) one or more hydroxyl-containing (meth)acrylic copolymers built up from     a1) 47 - 53% by weight of one or more aromatic vinyl compounds,   a2) 28 - 33% by weight of one or more hydroxyalkyl methacrylates,   a3) 14 - 19% by weight of one or more alkyl (meth)acrylates, and   a4) 0.5 - 2% by weight of acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid, having a hydroxyl number of 120 - 160 mg of KOH/g, an acid number of from 5 to 15 mg of KOH/g, a weight average molecular weight of from 10,000 to 20,000 and a glass transition temperature of from +40 DEG C to +60 DEG C, and B) an aliphatic and/or cycloaliphatic polyisocyanate or a mixture of such polyisocyanates in such an amount that from 0.5 to 2.0 isocyanate groups are present per hydroxyl group from component A).

A process for refinishing automotive bodies or parts
thereof, 
characterised in that
 a pigmented top coat
layer is applied or a base coat layer of a solvent-borne

or water-borne base coat is applied and the base
coat layer is provided with an unpigmented, transparent

coating layer, wherein the pigmented top coat layer is
produced or the unpigmented, transparent coating layer

is produced using a coating composition based on
hydroxy-functional (meth)acrylic copolymers, aliphatic

and/or cycloaliphatic polyisocyanates, solvents,
optionally together with additives and pigments

conventional in coatings, which coating composition
contains neither epoxy resins nor nitrocellulose and

contains as binder:

A) one or more (meth)acrylic copolymers which contain
hydroxyl groups, prepared from


a1)
47-53 wt.%
of one or more aromatic vinyl compounds,
a2)
28-33 wt.%
of one or more hydroxyalkyl methacrylates,
a3)
14-19 wt.%
of one or more alkyl (meth)acrylates, and
a4)
0.5-2 wt.%
of acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid,

with a hydroxyl value of 120-160 mg KOH/g, an acid
value of 5 to 15 mg KOH/g, a weight average

molecular weight of 10,000 to 20,000 and a glass
transition temperature of +40°C to +60°C,
B) an aliphatic and/or cycloaliphatic polyisocyanate
or a mixture of such polyisocyanates.in an amount

such that there are 0.5 to 2.0 isocyanate groups
per hydroxyl group of component A).
A process according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the component A) used is a (meth)acrylic copolymer, in
which


component a1) is a styrene or a styrene derivative,
component a2) is a hydroxyethyl methacrylate, and
component a3) is n-butyl (meth)acrylate.
A process according to claim 1 or 2, in which
component A) is obtainable from


a1) 47.5-52.5 wt.% of styrene
a2) 28.0-33.0 wt.% of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate
a3) 14.0-19.0 wt.% of n-butyl acrylate and
a4) 0.5-1.5 wt.% of acrylic acid.
A process according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised
in that
 component B) is an aliphatic and/or
cycloaliphatic polyisocyanate with a functionality

greater than or equal to 3 and an NCO value of 15
to 25.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 the transparent coating
composition is applied wet-in-wet onto the base coat

layer and is cured jointly therewith.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that
 the pigmented top coat layer or
the unpigmented coating layer is sprayed to a film

thickness of up to 120 µm in a single spray pass. 
A process according to one of claims 1 to 6,
