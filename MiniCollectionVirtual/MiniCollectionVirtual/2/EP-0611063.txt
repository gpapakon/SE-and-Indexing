<ABSTRACT>
A stapling apparatus for an office machine includes a housing having a fixed position 
output providing a sequential source of sheets. An output tray (77) is mounted on the housing 

adjacent the output for supporting the sheets. A compiler shelf (70) is located on the housing 
adjacent the output tray. A compiling mechanism (60) is mounted on the housing. A stapler 

(90) is movably mounted on the housing and is longitudinally reciprocable in relation to the 
shelf (70) and the compiling mechanism, i e. transversely of the process direction. The stapler 

and the compiler mechanism are so located in relationship to each other that the stapler has a 
strictly linear motion along an edge of the sheets.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to office machines and specifically to a finishing
station of an electrophotographic printing machine. More particularly, the present invention
relates to a stapler system of such a machine.In a typical electrophotographic printing process, a photoconductive member is
charged to a substantially uniform potential so as to sensitize the surface thereof. The charged
portion of the photoconductive member is exposed to a light image of an original document
being reproduced. Exposure of the charged photoconductive member selectively dissipates the
charges thereon in the irradiated areas. This records an electrostatic latent image on the
photoconductive member corresponding to the informational areas contained within the
original document. After the electrostatic latent image is recorded on the photoconductive
member, the latent image is developed by bringing a developer material into contact
therewith. Generally, the developer material comprises toner particles adhering
triboelectrically to carrier granules. The toner particles are attracted from the carrier granules
to the latent image forming a toner powder image on the photoconductive member. The
toner powder image is then transferred from the photoconductive member to a copy sheet.
The toner particles are heated to permanently affix the powder image to the copy sheet.In a commercial printing machine of the foregoing type, it is often desirable to stack
the discharged copy sheets, numbering from two sheets up to a large number of sheets, in sets
with very close stack registration so as to avoid a ragged or uneven looking stack edge in
finished, bound or stapled copy sets. It is further desirable when stapling or binding a set of
sheets to so locate or move the stapling or binding device that it can act upon the stack without
disturbing the stack registration.It is known in such office machines to provide a stapler mechanism which staples the
registered stack of sheets together. Such staplers can be mounted on a carriage which is moved
along one of the edges, the bind edge, of the stack of sheets in order that such stapling can
take place. However, in the conventionally known stapler systems associated with a compiler
of a copier, the stapler is a separate mechanism that needs to be moved in and out in order to
perform the stapling operation. Even in those staplers which are so positioned in relationship
to the compiler as to not need a movement of the stapler in order to perform the stapling
operation, the stapler if it is

<CLAIMS>
A compiling and stapling apparatus for an office machine, comprising:

a housing including a fixed position output (52) providing a succession of sheets in a
process direction;
an output tray (77) mounted on said housing adjacent said output (52) for holding the
sheets;
a compiler shelf (70) located on said housing adjacent said output tray (77), said compiler
shelf partially supporting said sheets;
a compiling mechanism (60) mounted on said housing; and
a stapler (90) movably mounted on said housing and being reciprocable longitudinally of
said shelf and said compiling mechanism (60) and transversely of the process direction;

characterized in that the apparatus further comprises at least one back wall section (100,
102), which is connected to the stapler (90) and travels therewith as the stapler (90) moves, for

stabilizing sheets as they are compiled; and in that said stapler (90) and said compiler mechanism
(60) are located relative to one another that said stapler (90) has a strictly linear motion along a bind

edge of the sheets to provide a plurality of stapling positions along said bind edge.
The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising two back wall sections (100, 102)
spaced apart from each other.
The apparatus of claim 2 wherein the two back wall sections (100, 102) are located
on respective sides of the stapler (90).
The apparatus of any one of claims 1 to 3 further comprising resilient means (104,
106) for connecting each back wall section (100, 102) to the stapler (90).
The apparatus of claim 4 wherein the resilient means (104, 106) comprise springs.
The apparatus of any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein each back wall section (100,
102) comprises a U-shaped member facing said output tray (77) so that said bind edge of the

sheets is located in said U-shaped member.
The apparatus of any one of claims 1 to 6 further comprising a tamping assembly
(76) located in said housing.
