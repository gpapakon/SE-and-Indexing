<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power connector comprising 
at least one contact member provided with a contact end, surrounded 
by a housing, and with an elongated connection portion of electrically 
conducting material for connecting the power connector to a 
printed circuit board. Such a power connector is known from United States patent 
4.702.707. The problem to be solved in that patent is to provide a 
power connecter having a removable mating component so that a damaged 
component can be easily replaced. To solve this problem a 
connector is provided with a base provided with a threaded bore 
opening out onto opposing surfaces and terminal pins for being 
soldered in holes in a printed circuit board for electrical engagement 
with power circuits thereon. By means of a screwdriver the 
mating component can be removed and replaced from the base. United States patent 3.426.311 discloses a transition device 
for connecting a coaxial transmission line to a strip line. In 
order to provide a reasonable rigid and dimensionally accurate 
structure to obtain minimum electrical discontinuity, the disclosed 
transition device comprises means for clamping the outer conductor 
of the coaxial line in abutting relation with the ends of shield 
plates of a strip line. The coaxial line comprises an inner conductor 
provided with a slot for receiving the end of a center conductor 
of the strip line and, preferably, being soldered thereto. A connector module generally comprises a housing of electrically 
insulative material which accommodates a plurality of contact 
elements or terminals arranged in rows and columns. The contact 
elements have a base section and a contact end and connecting end 
extending from opposite ends of the base section. The connecting 
ends project outside one side of the housing and are connected to a 
printed circuit board. There have long been attempts to accommodate electronic circuits 
in as modular a design as possible on printed circuit boards 
of standard dimensions. The interconnections between the individual 
modules and components, such as recorders, playback devices, etc., 
are preferably made via electronic connectors. As a consequence of 
miniaturization and due to the high density of present day integrated  
 
circuits, a large number of electronic components can be 
mounted on a printed circuit board so that a large number of functions 
can be carried out by a module of this type. The number of 
terminals needed for connection to other modules has, likewise, 
increased.
