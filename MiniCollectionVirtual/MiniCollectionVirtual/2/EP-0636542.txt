<ABSTRACT>
An aircraft life raft escape slide assembly for evacuating passengers 
from an aircraft and thereafter for providing a floating support when the 

evacuation is over water. Such assembly has an inflatable slide structure 
releasably connected to an inflatable boarding slide structure to define an 

integral unit but each structure being independently inflatable. The slide 
structure is inflated and deployed to operate as a slide and upon release of the 

inflatable slide structure from the aircraft and upon deployment of the boarding 
slide as a chute or slide, the inflatable slide structure operates as a raft.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to an aircraft escape
slide raft apparatus and more particularly to an inflatable
slide raft assembly that can be used both as a
slide for land evacuation of passengers and can also be
used as a slide raft for water evacuation of passengers.In the event an aircraft lands under emergency conditions
on land or sea as forced landings or "ditched" at
sea, escape apparatus must be provided so that the passenger
and crew evacuation can be done safely in as
quick a time as possible.In FR-A-7 332 435 an escape slide and a raft are disclosed.
The head end of the escape slide is, for example,
connected to an egress door of an aircraft. At the
toe end of the escape slide the raft is attached. The
slide and the raft are separate parts, which are connected
to each other. Both, the escape slide and the
raft, are pneumatically inflatable. The raft is provided
to carry passengers and crew members of the aircraft
when an aircraft lands under emergency conditions on
sea.When using an escape slide on land, there is a considerable
height requirement as from an aircraft that has
more than one passenger deck or where such type of aircraft
is ditched in water. In the last condition of use
where the slide raft assembly is deployed from the upper
deck, the slide raft cannot be loaded over its entire
length because a portion of it is so high off the water
and must be used as a slide which means a portion of its 
length cannot be used as raft capacity. This condition
would result in the need to carry supplemental rafts to
make up for the difference in capacity.It is an object of the present invention to provide an
aircraft life escape slide assembly that may be used on
land and on water.The aircraft life escape slide assembly of the invention
is defined by claim 1.The present invention provides an integral boarding
slide that permits release of the entire slide raft for
use as a raft and of itself permits the rapid evacuation
from the airplane onto the entire length of the raft.An aircraft life raft escape slide assembly of the invention
is for use in evacuating passengers and crew
members from an aircraft over land or water. The assembly
has interconnected a first inflatable structure and
a second inflatable structure. The first and second
structures each have a head end and a toe end. The head
end of the second inflatable structure is secured to the
aircraft adjacent to an egress door. The toe end of the
second inflatable structure is releasably connected to
the head end of the first inflatable
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An aircraft life raft escape slide assembly for use
from an egress door (12) of an aircraft, comprising:


a first inflatable structure (10) in the inflated
condition having a head end (17) and a toe end (18),
a second inflatable structure (35) having a head end
and a toe end (36), which head end is secured to the

aircraft adjacent the egress door (12) and which toe
end (36) is releasably connected to said head end

(17) of said first inflatable structure (10), and
pressurizing means (30,50) connected to said life
raft escape slide assembly and operative upon actuation

to pressurize said first inflatable structure
(10) and said second inflatable structure (35),
characterized in that
the head end (17) of the first inflatable structure
is releasably connected to the aircraft adjacent the

egress door (12) so as to allow the following conditions
of the escape slide assembly:
a first condition wherein both head ends (17) are
secured to said aircraft adjacent to said egress

door (12) and remain connected to the aircraft upon
deployment of said first inflatable structure (10)

as slide, and
a second condition wherein the connection between
the aircraft and said head end (17) of said first

inflatable structure (10) is released and said second
inflatable structure (35) which is arranged between

the aircraft and said first inflatable structure 
(10) is deployed so that said first inflatable

structure (10) is used as a raft and said second
inflatable structure (35) is used as a slide.
An aircraft life raft escape slide assembly as set
forth in claim 1, wherein said pressurizing means

(30,50) is operable to inflate said first inflatable
structure (10) and said second inflatable structure

(35) wherein said first structure (10) is deployable
as a slide or raft while said second structure (35)

is deployable as a slide.
An aircraft life raft escape slide assembly as set
forth in claim 1 or 2, wherein the releasable

connection between said toe end (36) of said second
inflatable structure (35) and said head end (17) of

said first inflatable structure (10) has release
means (41,42,43) for interconnecting said head end

(17) of said first inflatable structure (10) to said
toe end (36) of said second inflatable structure

(35) and is operative to release said first inflatable
structure (10) from said second inflatable

structure (35).
An aircraft life raft escape slide assembly as set
forth in claim 3, wherein said release means

(41,42,43) is a quick release means.
An aircraft life raft escape slide assembly as set
forth in one of claims 1-4, wherein the overall

length of said second inflatable structure (35) is
less than one-half the length of said first inflatable

structure (10).
An aircraft life raft escape slide assembly as set
forth in one of claims 1-5, wherein said first inflatable

structure (10) has at least two separate 
longitudinally extending slide paths (26) for simultaneous

passages of evacuees.
An aircraft life raft escape slide assembly as set
forth in one of claims 1-6, wherein said pressurizing

means (30,50) is located within said aircraft to
minimize the weight of said first inflatable structure

(10).
An aircraft life raft escape slide assembly as set
forth in one of claims 1-7, wherein said pressurizing

means (30,50) comprises a first pressurizing
means (30) and a second pressurizing means (50),

said first pressurizing means (30) operative upon
actuation to inflate and deploy said first inflatable

structure (10) as an escape slide, and said
second pressurizing means (50) operative upon actuation

to inflate said second inflatable structure
(35) as a slide and deploy said first inflatable

structure (10) as a raft.
An aircraft life raft escape slide assembly as set
forth in one of claims 1-8, wherein said first inflatable

structure (10) comprises at least two inflatable
side tubes (20,22) and two inflatable

transverse tubes (27,29), which join the ends
(17,18) of said side tubes (20,22) and a strip of

flexible material secured to said tubes to provide a
