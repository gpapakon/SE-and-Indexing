<DESCRIPTION>
Flexible, combustion-modified polyurethane foams are 
known. See, e.g., U.S. Patents 4,381,351 and 4,546,117. It is 
also known to produce such foams by reacting isocyanates with 
polyether polyols in the presence of melamine and, optionally, 
in the presence of various phosphorous flame retardants. See, 
U.S. Patents 4,644,015, 4,745,133, 4,757,093, 4,757,094, 
4,803,229, and 4,826,884, and British Patents 2,163,762 and 
2,177,405. U.S. Patent 4,258,141 describes the production of 
flexible, combustion-modified polyurethane foams by reacting 
polyether polyols with a polymethylenepoly(phenyl isocyanate) 
containing from 40 to 90% by weight of methylene-bis(phenyl 
isocyanate), in the presence of melamine. U.S. Patents 4,822,517 and 4,900,760 describes the 
production of flexible polyurethane foams using a specific 
polyisocyanate mixture which comprises: (a) from 73 to 77 
percent by weight of methylene-bis(phenyl isocyanate), having 
an isomer distribution of from 30 to 34% by weight of the 
2,4'isomer, from 60 to 66% by weight of the 4,4'-isomer and 
from 3 to 7% by weight of the 2,2'-isomer, and (b) from 23 to 
27% by weight of higher functional methylene-bridged polyphenyl 
polyisocyanates. The foams described in these references did 
not contain flame retardants.  
 EP-A-0485953 describes the production of a flexible polyurethane foam using an isocyanate-terminated 
prepolymer prepared from a polyisocyanate comprising 4,4'-methylene 
diphenyldiisocyanate and polyoxyalkylene polyol wherein the polyol has an average 
functionality of from 2 to 4, a hydroxy equivalent weight of from 2200 to 3500 and contains 
oxyethylene residues in an amount of from 40 to 68 percent by weight. Melamine is optionally 
used as flame retardent.  
 While many of the flexible combustion-modified 
polyurethane foams known in the art have met with some 
commercial success, such foams are generally deficient in one 
or more properties and are thus not useful for many 
applications. It was an object of the present invention to 
produce a foam having (i) excellent flame properties as 
measured by the Oxygen Index Test (ASTM D2863) and the Radiant 
Panel Test (ASTM 162), (ii) good tear strength as measured by  
 
ASTM Tests D3574 and D1938, (iii) good compression set and 
particularly good 50% set, and (iv) good softness properties. The present invention is directed to a flexible, 
combustion modified polyurethane foam prepared by reacting: 
a) one or more polyoxyalkylene polyols having hydroxy 
functionalities of from 2 to 3
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A flexible, combustion modified polyurethane foam 
prepared by reacting: 


a) one or more polyoxyalkylene polyols having hydroxy 
functionalities of from 2 to 3 and OH numbers of from 

10 to 170, with 
b) a polymethylene poly(phenyl isocyanate) having a 
methylene-bis(phenyl isocyanate) content of from 70 to 

77% by weight, wherein said methylene-bis(phenyl 
isocyanate) consists of no more than 6% by weight of 

the 2,2'-isomer and up to 100% by weight of a mixture 
of the 4,4'-isomer and the 2,4'-isomer, with the weight 

ratio of the 4,4'-isomer to the 2,4'-isomer being from 
2.3:1 to 7.0:1, in the presence of 
c) melamine, in an amount such that the total amount of 
melamine in said foam is from 17 to 33% by 

weight, 
d) a phosphorous flame retardant in amount such that the 
elemental phosphorous content in said foam is from 

0.15 to 1.0% by weight, and 
e) water as the sole blowing agent, 
 
the ratio of component a) to component b) being such that the 

isocyanate index is from 80 to 105. 
The foam of Claim 1, wherein said weight ratio is from 
2.4:1 to 3.8:1. 
The foam of Claim 1, wherein said polymethylene 
poly(phenyl isocyanate) has an isocyanate group content of from 

30 to 35% by weight. 
The foam of Claim 1, wherein said polyol has an OH number 
of from 25 to 50.
