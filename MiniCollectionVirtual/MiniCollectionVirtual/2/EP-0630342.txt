<DESCRIPTION>
Many polymer compositions are packaged in 
flexible packages such as paper and plastic bags. The 
bags are generally sealed at one end, placed under the 
exit orifice of a polymer manufacturing line, filled 
with polymer and sealed. Sealing means used include 
thread (e.g., cotton), various adhesives and, in the 
case of plastic bags, heat sealing. In the case where the polymer compositions 
are to be melt processed or masticated at high 
temperature, it has been desirable to package the melt 
processible polymer in a bag made from a plastic that, 
when processed along with the polymer composition, 
does not adversely affect the desired properties of 
the polymer composition. The advantages of such a 
combination are that the bag and polymer contents can 
be added to the processor together without having to 
open and empty the bag; and, of course, there are no 
empty bags to dispose of. The sealing means for such 
plastic bags have varied, the most common being heat 
sealing. Heat sealing is, however, not useful in 
situations where the polymer composition to be 
packaged is heat-sensitive, or where the polymer 
composition to be packaged contains powdery fines, or 
talc (hereinafter a heat seal sensitive polymer). For 
example, neoprene, a well-known homopolymer of 
chloroprene, or copolymer of chloroprene with other 
unsaturated monomers, is sold as unvulcanized chips 
that are quite tacky. To reduce the tackiness for 
ease of handling, the surface of chips is treated with 
the talc. The talc, however, interferes with heat-sealing 
processes. One way to overcome this  
 
problem is disclosed in U.S. 4,190,156 (Adam) whereby 
a thermoplastic bag is closed using synthetic polymer 
thread. The bag material and thread are said to be 
readily dispersible in the neoprene at the blending 
temperature to give homogeneous dispersion. The 
thread used is made from polyvinyl alcohol having a 
melt temperature of 213° (well above the 
processing/compounding temperature of neoprene, i.e, 
100-120°C) and is said to have sufficiently low 
strength so as to break and disperse readily in the 
polymer at the blending stage. However, in some 
applications, dispersed particulate polymer such as 
polyvinyl alcohol is undesirable in that it interferes 
with the processing of the polymer. Therefore, there remains a need for a 
bag/seal packaging system, for heat-seal sensitive 
polymers, where the bag/seal can be introduced into 
the polymer melt processor unopened, and where the 
bag/seal composition will not interfere
