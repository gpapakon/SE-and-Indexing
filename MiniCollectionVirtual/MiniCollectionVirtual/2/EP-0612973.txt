<ABSTRACT>
A displacement transducer consists of an electrometer 
through which charge transport is limited by Coulomb 

blockade and a displacement member which degenerates 
the Coulomb blockade effect as a function of 

displacement. The electrometer comprises a 
nanofabricated conductive island (1) with a source and 

drain (2, 3) coupled to the island through tunnel 
junctions (T1, T2). A movable metallic element (4) 

forms a capacitive coupling (Cg) with the island, 
which degenerates the Coulomb blockade as a function of 

displacement (δx), so that the current flow between 
the source and drain is a function of the displacment 

of the element (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a displacement transducer which
may resolve displacements of the order of fractions of an
angstrom unit.Displacement transducers which utilise a conventional FET
are known from US-A-4 767 973, in which a movable member
forms a capacitative coupling with the gate of the FET,
so as to control its source/drain current as a function
of displacement of the movable member. The current that
flows is a conventional current consisting of very large
numbers of electrons.Coulomb blockade electrometers have previously been
proposed - D. V. Averin and K. K. Likharev, Journal Low
Temperature Physics 62, 345 (1986); T. A. Fulton and G.
J. Dolan, Physics Review Letters 59, 109 (1987). A
Coulomb blockade electrometer is a three terminal device
which provides a direct method of converting a small
charge variation on the plate of a capacitor into a
change of current passing through the device. Currently,
Coulomb blockade electrometers have demonstrated a
sensitivity which is several orders of magnitude greater 
than current commercial electrometers. The Coulomb
blockade electrometer typically consists of a nanometrescale
conducting island, formed on a substrate to which
source and drain connections are formed through
respective tunneling barrier junctions. A further
capacitive coupling to the island is provided to allow
charge to be applied thereto. The applied charge alters
the current flowing between the source and drain
connections. When the conducting island is made
sufficiently small, the current flow between the source
and drain can be characterised in terms of single
electrons, and when one electron flows from the source
onto the island, another electron is caused to flow from
the island to the drain. The rate at which this process
occurs is dependent upon the charge applied through the
capacitive coupling to the island.In accordance with the present invention, it has been
appreciated that such an arrangement may be modified in
order to provide a displacement transducer.Broadly stated, in accordance with the present invention
there is provided a displacement transducer comprising
means for providing a charge storage region, a source and
a drain for charge carriers to the region, charge flow
from the source to the drain through the charge storage
region being limited by Coulomb blockade, and a movable
member that forms a capacitative coupling with the charge 
storage region to affect the conductivity between the
source and drain as a function of the displacement (δx)
of the member.In order
