<ABSTRACT>
A barcode printer system is shown having a 
host processing system in communication with a 

barcode printer. The host processing system 
converts multi-level user input printer commands 

into a data stream in the printer control language 
of the barcode printer for transmission to the 

printer. The host processing system stores a 
number of printer command function routines, each 

of which is associated with a number of multi-level 
user input printer commands. Each user input 

printer command includes format and data 
information in a single command. A low level user 

input printer command, however, may include only a 
user readable word and data, the host processing 

system automatically utilizing stored default 
values for the format information when converting 

the command. A higher level user input printer 
command may include an abbreviation designating the 

command and values for one or more format variables 
as well as data. The multi-level user commands are 

not fixed in length so as to be user friendly for 
low level users but flexible for higher level 

users.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a
barcode printer system including a
host processing system and means for converting multi-level
user input printer commands into a data stream in a
predetermined printer language for communication to a
barcode printer.A known barcode printer for printing on tags,
labels, etc. receives, from a host processing system,
a data packet and a format packet that controls a
printing operation of the barcode printer. The format
packet defines the various fields to be printed on
the tag or label, the position of each field on the
tag or label, the font type and size, as well as
other attributes of the tag or label to be printed.
The data packet defines the information to be printed
in the various fields defined by the format packet.
The problem with the above is that in order to print
a job on this barcode printer, a user is typically
required to create a format record and a separate
data record for each field in a very cryptic printer
language with each character of the respective record
specifically defined in a programmer's manual. This
is a time-consuming, laborious task even for a user
familiar with the printer language. Further, because
the creation of the format and data records is not a 
user-friendly operation, users with a low-level of
printer language knowledge find the task difficult to
accomplish.EP 0 578 924 A1 (which falls within the terms of Article 54(3) EPC) discloses a host communication
message manager for a label printing system. This
system allows one or more host processing systems to
communicate with a local system to control the
maintenance of data, including barcode data stored in
the local processing system.WO 89/10601 discloses a label generation apparatus
which enables a user to create a label of a desired
size and shape and which has a unique identifying
characteristic with respect to other lables in a
series of such labels. The apparatus uses a templare
generator for providing a basic label format with one
or more writable indicia fields. The apparatus also
uses an indicia generator for producing individual
identification characters of each label. The data
from each generator is then combined and used to
drive a printer which transfers the individually
identified labels onto label material.EP 0 550 269 A2 (which falls within the terms of Article 54(3) EPC) discloses a printer that can
simultaneously print barcodes and alphanumeric
numbers or other characters. The printer includes a
data input means, a data storage means and a data
convertion

<CLAIMS>
A barcode printing system comprising:

a barcode printer (11) responsive to a printer command data
stream received in a predetermined printer language to print a

barcode (21) with or without alphanumeric information (23) on a
web (25) of record members (27); and


a host processing system capable of communicating with
said barcode printer (11) and having a user operable input

device, said host processing system including
means for correlating each printer command function of a plurality of printer

command functions with a plurality of associated user input
printer commands including a low level user input printer

command that specifies a command word, data and little or no
format information and a high level user input printer command

that specifies an abbreviation for a command word, data and
more format information wherein the user input printer commands

are enterable via said input device and each of said user input
printer commands associated with a given printer command

function requires a different level of information to be
entered by a user for a given printer command function; and
means responsive to said correlating means for converting
an entered user input printer command into a printer command

data stream in said predetermined printer language.
A barcode printer system as recited
in claim 1 wherein said low level user input printer command

includes a user readable word and said high level user input
printer command includes an abbreviation of said word.
A barcode printer system as recited
in claim 1 wherein each printer command function has a

plurality of associated format variables defining attributes of
said function, and further including means for storing default

values for each of said variables to allow a user to enter for 
a printer command function a low level user input printer

command that does not include values for each of said variables
or a higher level user input printer command that does include

values for at least one of said variables.
A barcode printer system as recited
in claim 1 wherein one of said printer command functions
