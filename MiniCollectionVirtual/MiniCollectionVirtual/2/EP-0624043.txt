<ABSTRACT>
A cable management system provides routing of 
wired services between service lines (16) and user lines 

(18) under computer control. Each service line (16) enters 
the cable management system at a service termination 

unit card (22) which also holds a portion of a 
crosspoint switch matrix. Each user line (18) enters the 

cable management system at a line termination unit card 
(20). The service termination unit cards (22) are all 

mounted to a first side of a centerplane board (24) as a 
vertically oriented stacked array and the line 

termination unit cards (20) are mounted to tne other side of 
the centerplane board (24) as a horizontally oriented stacked 

array. Pins extending through the centerplane board (24) 
interconnect the cards (20,22) so that any service line (16) can be 

connected to any user line (18). A management station 
computer (14) is provided, by means of which an operator 

can control the system to connect a specified service 
line (16) to a specified user line (18) and also to disconnect a 

specified service line from a specified user line.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the distribution of 
wiring and, more particularly, to a cable management 
system which provides routing of telephony, low and high 
speed data, power and video, between service lines and 
user lines under computer control. When wiring a commercial building, it is 
conventional that all of the services carried by wire, 
such as telephony, low and high speed data, power and 
video, enter the building for termination at respective 
patch panels. The patch panels are typically located 
within wiring closets and include a first array of 
terminations for the service lines which enter the 
building and a second array of terminations for the user 
lines which extend within the building to various user 
stations. Within each patch panel, the connections 
between the service lines and the user lines are made 
manually via jumper wires extending between the first 
array of terminations and the second array of 
terminations. In an ideal situation, records would be 
maintained as to where each wire goes within the 
building and to what it is connected. However, since 
the real world is not ideal, such records are not always 
properly maintained. In addition, wires are often 
tagged at the patch panels and the tags are lost or 
become outdated because of lack of updating. Therefore, 
when a technician is given a service order to add, move 
or change a connection, the technician must first 
determine exactly which physical wires are involved. 
This has proven to be a very time consuming and labor 
intensive chore. It is therefore an object of the 
present invention to provide a cable management system 
with automatic record keeping capability. In addition to the record keeping problem, the 
conventional patch panel approach results in a jumble of  
 
wires which makes it difficult physically to access the 
service line and user line termination arrays. It is 
therefore another object of the present invention to 
provide a cable management system which eliminates the 
use of jumper wires to cross-connect the service and 
user lines. It is a further object of the present invention to 
provide a cable management system wherein different 
types of services can be accommodated and connected to 
only those user lines suitable therefor. It is yet another object of the present invention 
to provide a cable management system wherein after a 
building has been initially wired, subsequent additions, 
moves and changes can be effected remotely without 
requiring a technician manually to make
