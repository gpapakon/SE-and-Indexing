<ABSTRACT>
The subject-matter of the invention is a hydrodynamic high-pressure rotor seal. The object of the invention is to ensure that lubrication of the sealing surface by means of the operating medium is sufficient at all times. The solution to this object is to provide at least one axial deviation ( alpha ) of the sealing surface (16) from a virtual radial plane (M), with the result that the (mutually accompanying) sealing edges (26 and 28) meander. The advantage of this solution is the continuously repeated entrainment of the axially available operating medium into the sealing gap by means of the sealing edge/s.

Hydrodynamic high-pressure seal for liquid operating
media with an elastomer ring (10) as static sealing

element for the radial prestress of a possibly elastomer
slide ring (12) as dynamic sealing element which is

provided with a radially acting sealing surface (16)
at the circumference of the slide ring (12) with two

ring-shaped sealing edges (26, 28) for axial limitation
of the sealing surface (16) whereby said sealing surface

(16) has at least one axial sealing edge deviation
from a virtual radial plane in such a way that

different sections of said sealing surface (16)
connected in direction of the circumference of the

sealing surface, show at one and/or the other sealing
edge (26, 28) a different course of the edge sections

pertaining to said surface sections ,

characterized in that
 with respect to
the developed view of the slide ring (12) at least

one of the two sealing edges (26, 28), preferrably
both sealing edges, have a zigzag-shaped periodic course,

whereby said zigzag-shaped course of the laid-out sealing
edge (26, 28) consists of straight-lined sections.
High-pressure seal as set forth in claim 1 wherein
the two sealing edges (26, 28) of its slide ring (12)

have a zigzag-shaped periodic course, and the axial
width of the sealing surface (16) is constant. 
High-pressure seal according to claims 1 or 2

characterized in that
 the zigzag-shaped sections of the
sealing surface (16) are of equal length and/or form

pairwise equal obtuse angles (180° - 2 ∝) between two
successive sealing surface sections of the developed

view of the slide ring.
High-pressure seal according to claim 3, 
characterized
in that
 the axial inner tangents (T) to one or the
other sealing edges (26/28) coincide (Fig. 4) or show

a negative axial distance from each other so that the
laid-out sealing surface (16) along the middle line

(M) of the two tangents (T) seems to be
interrupted.
High-pressure seal according to one of the claims 1
to 4 
characterized in that
 both rings (10 and 12) are
formed in one piece.
High-pressure seal according to one of the claims 1
to 5 
characterized in that
 the elastomer ring (10)
has a rectangular profile.
