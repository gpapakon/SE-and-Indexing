<ABSTRACT>
A loading control system (12) for a cyclical centrifugal machine (10) operates with a rotary cylindrical basket (14) and a loading gate member (23) to control delivery of charge material into the basket (14) and includes controls (4-6) for moving the loading gate member (23) from a closed position to a full open position that is variable in extent to adapt it for various loading properties of the charge material, together with a controller (40) for moving the loading gate member (23) from the full open position to a pinch position to slow delivery of charge material into the basket (14) and for determining the pinch position in predetermined relation to the extent of gate member (23) opening in the preceding gate member (23) full open position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for controlling the flow of material through a
loading gate into a rotating centrifugal basket in order
accurately and quickly to deliver into the basket a
certain desired amount of the material to be treated in a
cycle of operation of the centrifugal machine.More specifically, the invention relates to a
system for automatically adjusting the extent of opening
of a loading gate as material is being delivered through
the gate to form a charge wall in a centrifugal basket,
so that before the desired final charge wall thickness is
reached and the gate then closed, a flow pinching
position of the gate is established which will depend in
extent upon the extent the gate is open when in a full
open position employed for the principal part of a basket
loading operation. The flow pinching position thus is
varied in different basket loading operations in accordance
with changes of the gate full open positions
employed for these operations and, accordingly, in
desirable relation to variations of the loading properties,
such as the fluidity or viscosity of the charge
material to be processed in the machine. The system of the present invention has application
especially in connection with the operation of heavy
cyclical centrifugal machines of the type used in the
manufacture and refining of sugar.The known systems for controlling the loading of
charge material into the baskets of such machines do not
adequately enable compensation for variations in the
loading properties of the charge material to be processed.
Such variations often occur from one batch to
another, and even between earlier and later operations
with different portions of the same batch, of a charge
material such as sugar massecuite. When they occur they
may adversely affect the uniformity of basket loading
needed from cycle to cycle for efficient centrifugal
processing. For example, a high fluidity can lead to
overfilling of or even spillage of charge material from
the basket; while with a viscous, slowly flowing charge
material a sudden gate closing can leave the basket
unevenly loaded, thus causing rough, unbalanced running
of the machine.Variations of loading properties of the charge
material are often difficult or even impossible to
avoid. In the case of sugar massecuites, for example,
their amenability to being loaded into and processed in
centrifugal machines will vary with numerous factors
among which are the massecuite temperature, sugar grain
size, degree of crystallization, syrup

<CLAIMS>
A centrifugal apparatus (10) including a rotary
centrifugal basket (14), a loading gate (20) movable between

closed and open positions to control the delivery of charge
material through said gate for loading the basket and control

means (12) operative in response to each opening of said gate
for closing said gate when a certain final volume of charge

material is accumulated in the basket, characterized in that
said control means comprises:


means (40, P1, A11, 80) for moving said gate from a
closed position to a gate full open position that is variable

in extent to adapt it for loading properties of the charge
material;
means (40, A9, 92) operative in response to the load in
the basket approaching said final volume for moving the gate

from the gate full open position to a pinch position to slow
said delivery;
means (40, P3, A10, 80) operative in response to the
load reaching the final volume for moving the gate from the

pinch position to the closed position; and
means (P2, TP2) operative in response to a variation of

position to adjust automatically the extent the gate will be
open when in said pinch position.
Centrifugal apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
pinch position adjusting means (40) includes means (42) for

producing a signal proportional in magnitude to the extent

Centrifugal apparatus according to claims 1 or 2,
wherein said pinch position adjusting means (40) includes

means (112) for adjusting the proportional relationship
between the extent the gate is open in said gate full open

position and the extent the gate will be open in said pinch
position. 
Centrifugal apparatus according to claim 3, in which
said means for adjusting the proportional relationship

includes a pinch position circuit (112) operative in response
to an extent of movement of said gate to said gate full open

position within a certain range of extent of said movement to

Centrifugal apparatus according to claim 7, wherein said
load signal diminishes in magnitude with increase of said
