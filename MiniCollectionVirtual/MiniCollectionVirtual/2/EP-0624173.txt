<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to catalysts for the reaction of reactive hydrogen-containing compounds or acid
anhydrides. particularly phenolic hydroxyl- and carboxyl-containing compounds with epoxides, compositions containing
such catalysts, to processes employing such catalysts and curable and cured products or articles.High molecular weight epoxy resins have been previously prepared by reacting phenolic compounds with epoxide
compounds in the presence of such catalysts as inorganic bases, amines, ammonium salts. phosphine and phosphonium
salts such as described in U.S. Patents 3.284,212: 3,547,881: 3,477,990: 3,948,855 and 4,438,254, in EP-A-19852
and 209174 and in FR-A-2 497 219. However, most of these catalysts while being suitable for catalyzing the
reaction between phenolic hydroxyl-containing compounds and epoxides, possess some undesirable features such as
poor reactivity which requires high catalyst levels and long reaction times: poor selectivity to the reaction of phenolic
hydroxyl groups with epoxides, or difficulty in deactivation.In batch processes or in a continuous process for the production of advanced resins such as by the extruder
process disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,612.156 it would be highly desirable to have available for use in that process a
catalyst which would be highly active, highly selective to the reactive hydrogen atoms, particularly phenolic hydroxyl
groups, and easily deactivated.It would also be desirable to have a catalyst which will result in fast cure when an epoxy resin is cured with a
curing agent, particularly with acid anhydrides.One aspect of the present invention pertains to an improvement in a precatalyzed composition comprising (A) at
least one compound containing an average of at least one vicinal epoxide group per molecule and (B) at least one
phosphonium or phosphine catalyst: characterised by employing in this precatalyzed composition as the phosphine
catalyst, one represented by the following general formula I,

wherein each R is independently a C1 to C4 alkyl phenyl group, and as the phosphonium catalyst one represented
by the following general formulae II or III

wherein each R is independently a C1 to C4 alkyl phenyl group;
R' is independently hydrogen, a halogen or a nitro or cyano or hydroxyl
or alkyl or alkoxy or halogen substituted hydrocarbyl group having from
1 to 20 carbon atoms, a monovalent unsaturated aliphatic group, an
unsaturated cycloaliphatic, aromatic, aryl substituted aliphatic or
cycloaliphatic group or an unsaturated aliphatic or
