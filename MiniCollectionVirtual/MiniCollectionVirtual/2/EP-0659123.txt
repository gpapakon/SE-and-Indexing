<ABSTRACT>
In order to strip paint from the skin (10) of an aircraft, the invention proposes a device with a work head (12) with a treatment chamber (34) which can be placed close (38) against the skin of the aircraft. Located in the treatment chamber is a heat-exchange unit (40) whose curved end surface (42) matches the curvature of the aircraft skin (10) and is brought into thermal contact with the paint layer on the skin directly or through a layer (52) of heat-conducting gas. Liquid nitrogen (48) is allowed to evaporate in the heat-exchange unit. The resulting coolant gas is led away from the work head (12) through a common main.
