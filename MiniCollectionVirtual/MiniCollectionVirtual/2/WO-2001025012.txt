<ABSTRACT>
There are disclosed methods and systems for the process of on-press plate imaging, including automatic processes for plate preparation, that compensate for registration and print-length errors (plate loading is performed before imaging). As a result of these processes, the position accuracy is determined by the imaging system. The system of the present invention creates deformed images on the plates during the imaging stage, these deformed images, being such that the separations will be in register (coordinated) after printing.

 DIGITAL OFFSET PRINTING REGISTRATIONCROSS REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThis patent application claims priority from and is related to U S ProvisionalPatent Application S/N 60/157,856, entitled DIGITAL OFFSET PRINTINGREGISTRATION, filed on October 6, 1999, this Provisional Patent Application incorporated by reference in its entirety hereinFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is directed to lithography, and in particular, to compensating for deformities in color separations by imaging correspondingly deformed images on printing plates, such that these plates will print the color separations in registerBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONConventional lithography processes typically replicate images by transferring ink from a previously prepared plate onto a substrate, typically paper In offset printing, this transfer is done indirectly by a soft blanket that is stamped by the plate This soft blanket then impresses this image onto paperColor images are obtained by separating the image into four color process plates, these four colors corresponding to Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black, commonly known as "CMYK", that are then combined on paper If an image is to be accurately represented, all four color separations must have the same length, scale and position when impressed on the paper However, this is difficult, as there may be misalignment and scale errors, these errors being classified as either fixed errors or paper errors Fixed errors are errors in misalignment and scale that do not change from image to image These errors are typically caused by tolerances of the prepress imaging devices, errors produced during development of the imaged plates, errors in mounting the plates on the printing press cylinders, and errors of the printing press mechanisms Errors of the printing press mechanisms typically 

include plate cylinders having lost their roundness from wear or the like, and loosening of gears, bearings, etc , typically from wear over timePaper errors typically result from paper wetting by fountain solution and ink, and by forces applied on the paper by the printing press, that tend to deform the paper With the paper deformed, data is printed at undesired or unintended locations Even when the deformation forces on the paper are released, the paper does not usually recover to its original configuration, and thus, there is a difference between the data (on the imaged printing plate) and the resultant printed image Paper deformation effects, that result in paper errors, are explained byFigs 1A - 1 C

<CLAIMS>
What is claimed is:
1. A system for elimination of printing registration errors, comprising: a processor programmed for: predicting registration errors; and computing distortion parameters based on said registration errors for creating distorted images; and an exposure system in communication with said processor, said exposure system configured for exposing said distorted images.
2. The system of claim 1 , wherein said processor is additionally programmed for receiving input data including: paper data, at least one machine parameter, at least one fixed error map, and the ink distribution data.
3. The system of claim 2, wherein said ink distribution data is from a low resolution image file.
4. The system of claim 1 , where said exposure system includes a strobe card configured for changing timing signals.
5. The system of claim 1 , wherein said exposure system includes means for changing the resolution of an image.
6. A method for preparation of printing members comprising: providing a reference image; calculating errors for substantially all of the pixels for at least one separation in said reference image; and utilizing at least one of strobe data or data manipulation card in combination with said calculated errors to control the rate of imaging to create a distorted image. 7. The method of claim 6, wherein said step of providing a reference image includes providing said reference image in a low resolution file.
8. The method of claim 6, additionally comprising: providing a printing member; and placing said distorted image onto said printing member.
