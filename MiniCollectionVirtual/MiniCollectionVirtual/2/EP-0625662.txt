<ABSTRACT>
A clamp for mounting a tube to a support plate in a gas turbine engine includes a 
base plate and a capture plate for capturing the tube therebetween, with a fastener 

positionable through the base and capture plates for clamping them together and mounting 
the tube to the support plate. The base plate includes a first recess therein for receiving 

the tube, which recess includes three adjoining sides sized and configured for contacting 
the tube at two points.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to gas turbine engines, and, more 
specifically, to a clamp for securing tubes within the engine against movement, including 
vibratory movement, therein. A gas turbine engine such as that used for powering an aircraft in flight, for 
example, includes numerous tubes for channeling various fluids through the engine during 
operation. Conventional clamps are used for mounting the tubes to the engine casing, at 
standoff brackets for example, to accurately position the tubes and prevent their movement 
during operation of the engine. Since the gas turbine engine includes various rotating components, the tubes are 
subject to vibratory excitation which must be controlled for preventing vibratory fatigue 
damage thereto. One exemplary conventional tube clamp used in an aircraft gas turbine 
engine has two clamp halves pivoted together at respective first ends thereof so that the 
clamp halves may be opened for inserting one or more tubes therebetween, and then 
pivoted together to capture the tubes. Each clamp half typically includes a generally 
semicircular recess which collectively surround a respective tube, and a fastener hole 
extends through the tube clamp halves so that a suitable fastener, such as a bolt, may be 
inserted through the holes, with a complementary nut joined to the bolt for clamping 
together the two clamp halves around the one or more tubes therein. The fastener typically 
also extends through an engine mounted bracket for joining the tube clamp and the tubes 
therein to the engine casing. Conventional tube clamps are typically made of suitable metals such as aluminum 
stainless steel, or Inconel which are selected for use in the engine depending upon the 
temperature of the individual location from relatively cool near the fan of the engine to  
 
relatively hot near the combustor and turbines thereof. Since metal tube clamps are known 
to abrade or chafe the tubes contained therein due to vibratory excitation of the tubes 
during engine operation, a conventional wear sleeve, made of epoxy for example, is 
positioned between the tube and the tube clamp to prevent undesirable-wear of the tube 
during operation. These conventional tube clamps including wear sleeves are relatively complex in 
structure, manufacture, and assembly thereof, and collectively add substantially to the 
weight of the engine. The wear sleeve is an additional part and must be suitably secured 
to the tube to prevent its liberation therefrom during operation of the engine

<CLAIMS>
A clamp for mounting a tube to a support plate in a gas turbine engine comprising: 
   a base plate including a lower surface disposable on said support plate, a flat upper 

surface having a first recess therein for receiving said tube, and a first hole spaced from 
said first recess and extending through said base plate from said lower to upper surfaces 

thereof; 
   a capture plate including a lower surface facing said base plate upper surface, an 

upper surface, and a second hole extending through said capture plate from said lower to 
upper surfaces thereof; 

   said base plate and said capture plate being joinable together for aligning together 
said first and second holes; 

   a fastener positionable through said first and second holes into said support plate 
for clamping said capture plate to said base plate, with said capture plate lower surface 

being effective for clamping said tube against said first recess; and 
   said first recess including at least three adjoining sides defined by a left seat, a right 

seat, and a middle seat disposed between said left and right seats, said left and right seats 
being sized and configured to contact said tube at two points, and said middle seat being 

spaced away from said tube without contact therewith. 
A clamp according to claim 1 wherein: 
   said tube has an outer diameter; and 

   said left and right seats define with said capture plate lower surface a circle having 
a diameter less than said tube outer diameter preselected for providing a predetermined 

compressive load on said tube when said fastener clamps together said base and capture 
plates. 
A clamp according to claim 2 wherein said left and right seats are inclined 
symmetrically relative to said middle seat. 
A clamp according to claim 3 wherein said left, right, and middle seats are 
substantially straight, with said middle seat being disposed parallel to said base plate upper 

surface. 
A clamp according to claim 2 wherein said capture plate lower surface has a second 

recess therein spaced from said second hole for receiving said tube, said second recess 
including at least three adjoining sided defined by a left cover, a right cover, and a middle 

 
cover disposed between said left and right covers, said left and right covers being sized and 

configured to contact said tube at two points, and said middle cover being spaced away 
from said tube without contact therewith. 
A clamp according to claim 5 wherein said left, right, and middle covers are 
substantially straight, with said left and right covers being inclined symmetrically relative 

to said middle cover, and said middle cover being disposed parallel to said capture plate 
lower surface and said middle seat. 
A clamp according to claim 2 wherein said first recess is sized for receiving said 
entire tube outer diameter. 
A clamp according to claim 7 wherein said capture plate includes a distal end 
positionable adjacent to said tube, and said capture plate lower surface, including said 

capture plate lower surface at said capture plate distal end, is completely flat. 
A clamp according to claim 7 wherein said capture plate includes a distal end in the 
form of a lip extending toward said base plate upper surface and positionable adjacent to 

said tube on an opposite side thereof relative to said capture plate second hole and said 
fastener positionable therethrough, said lip having a lip depth less than said tube outer 

diameter for preventing rotation of said capture plate about said fastener when said capture 
plate abuts said base plate. 
A clamp according to claim 9 wherein; 
   said base plate includes a pair of said first recesses disposed on opposite sides of 

said base plate first hole for receiving a pair of said tubes, respectively; 
   said capture plate includes a pair of said lips on opposite sides of said capture plate 

second hole; and 
   said capture plate is effective for clamping said pair of tubes to said base plate upon 

loading of said fastener.
