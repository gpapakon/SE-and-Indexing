<ABSTRACT>
A process for forming a diffusion aluminide coating (12) on a
substrate (10), such as a component for a gas turbine engine. The

process generally entails placing the substrate (10) in a suitable coating
chamber, flowing an inert or reducing gas into and through the coating

chamber, and then aluminizing the substrate (10) using an aluminizing
technique with a substantially constant aluminum activity, such as a

vapor phase deposition process. During the aluminizing process, the
amount of unreacted aluminum within the coating chamber is

controlled by altering the flow rate of the gas through the coating
chamber so that a portion of the unreacted aluminum is swept from the

coating chamber by the gas. The amount of unreacted aluminum swept
from the coating chamber is regulated by metering the gas flow rate in

order to control the aluminizing rate and aluminum content of the
resulting aluminide coating (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes for forming protective diffusion
aluminide coatings. More particularly, this invention relates to a process for
controlling the thickness and aluminum content of a diffusion aluminide
coating by controlling aluminum activity during the coating process.The operating environment within a gas turbine engine is both thermally and
chemically hostile. Significant advances in high temperature capabilities
have been achieved through the development of iron, nickel and cobalt-base
superalloys and the use of oxidation-resistant environmental coatings
capable of protecting superalloys from oxidation, hot corrosion, etc.Diffusion aluminide coatings have particularly found widespread use for
superalloy components of gas turbine engines. These coatings are generally
formed by such methods as diffusing aluminum deposited by chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) or slurry coating, or by a diffusion process such as pack
cementation, above-pack, or vapor (gas) phase deposition. As depicted in
Figure 1, a diffusion aluminide coating 12 generally has two distinct zones,
the outermost of which is an additive layer 16 containing an environmentally-resistant
intermetallic represented by MAI, where M is iron, nickel or cobalt,
depending on the substrate material. The MAI intermetallic is the result of
deposited aluminum and an outward diffusion of iron, nickel or cobalt from
the substrate 10. Beneath the additive layer 16 is a diffusion zone 14
comprising various intermetallic and metastable phases that form during the
coating reaction as a result of diffusional gradients and changes in elemental
solubility in the local region of the substrate 10. During high temperature
exposure in air, the additive layer 16 forms a protective aluminum oxide
(alumina) scale or layer (not shown) that inhibits oxidation of the diffusion
coating 12 and the underlying substrate 10. Diffusion processes generally entail reacting the surface of a component
with an aluminum-containing gas composition. Examples of such processes
are described in EP 0 731 187A, US 5,368,888 and US 5,658,614. In pack
cementation processes, the aluminum-containing gas composition is
produced by heating a powder mixture of an aluminum-containing source
(donor) material, a carrier (activator) such as an ammonium or alkali metal
halide, and an inert filler such as calcined alumina. The ingredients of the
powder mixture are mixed and then packed and pressed around the
component to be treated, after which the component and powder mixture

A process for forming a diffusion aluminide coating (12), the process
comprising the steps of:


placing a substrate (10) in a coating chamber;
providing within the coating chamber, an aluminum-containing vapor
having a substantially constant aluminum activity;
flowing an inert or reducing gas into and through the coating chamber;
and
producing a diffusion aluminide coating (12) on the substrate (10) by
contacting the substrate with the aluminum-containing vapor to cause a

portion of the aluminum-containing vapor to react with and deposit aluminum
on the substrate while maintaining the substantially constant aluminum activity

of the aluminum-containing vapor within the coating chamber, and while
controlling the rate at which the aluminum is deposited on the substrate by

altering the flow rate of the gas through the coating chamber so that a portion
of the unreacted aluminum-containing vapor is swept from the coating

chamber by the gas, and so that greater amounts of the unreacted aluminum-containing
vapor are swept from the coating chamber with higher gas flow

rates.
A process according to claim 1, wherein the process is a vapor phase
deposition process.
A process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the substrate (10) is a
superalloy.
A process according to claim 2 wherein the vapor phase deposition
process is performed at 950°C to 1150°C for a duration of two to ten hours.
A process according to any preceding claim, wherein the substrate (10)
is a gas turbine engine component.
A process according to claim 2, wherein the gas flow rate through the
coating chamber is decreased while the diffusion aluminide coating (12) is

produced, such that the diffusion aluminide coating (12) has a higher 
aluminum content at an outer portion thereof than at an inner portion thereof.
A process according to claim 2 wherein, prior to the aluminizing step, a
first surface portion of the substrate (10) has a diffusion aluminide coating (12)

and a second surface portion of the substrate (10) is free of any diffusion
