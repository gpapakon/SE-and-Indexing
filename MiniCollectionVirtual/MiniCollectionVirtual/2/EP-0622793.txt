<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related with an apparatus for 
reproducing an optical recording medium, such as a CD (Compact 
Disc) and a LD (Laser Disc), on which signals of various 
information such as audio and image information are recorded, 
and also a method of reproducing the same. More particularly, 
the present invention is related with an apparatus for and a 
method of reproducing an optical recording medium, on which 
information is recorded by a high density. A recording disc has a center hole at its central 
portion. Information is recorded as one track connected with 
the outer circumference of this center hole in a spiral shape. 
This kind of recording disc is constituted as shown in FIG. 7A. 
Namely, a phase pit portion 52 in a concavo-convex form 
corresponding to information, is formed on a transparent disc 
substrate 51, made from acrylic resin (Polymethyl 
methacrylate; PMMA) etc.. An aluminum film 55 having a high 
reflection coefficient, is vapor-deposited on the disc 
substrate 51 on which the phase pit portion 52 is formed. And, 
a protection layer 54 made from plastic etc., is formed on the 
aluminum film 55.  When reproducing information from the recording disc 
having the above mentioned constitution, a laser beam 60 as a 
reading light is irradiated onto the phase pit portion 52 of 
the track, which becomes an object for reproduction, from the 
side of the transparent disc substrate 51. As shown in FIG. 
7B, a reflected light 61, which is reflected by a mirror 
finished surface portion between the pits where no phase pit 70 
exists, is detected as "bright". On the other hand, the 
reflected light 61, which is reflected by the phase pit portion 
52, is detected as "dark". In this manner, the information 
corresponding to each record pit i.e. phase pit 70 of the 
information pit portion 52, is reproduced by the "bright" and 
"dark" reflected lights. Apart from that, since the diameter of the beam spot is 
determined in dependence on the wavelength of the light beam, 
there is a certain limit to reduce the diameter of the light 
spot in order to increase the recording density. Therefore, in case of recording the information by use 
of a narrow track pitch between adjacent record tracks (at the 
time of high density recording), if the information is recorded 
with a narrow track pitch exceeding the limit of the reduction 
of the diameter of the light spot, the light beam would be 
projected onto two or more tracks. As a result, there arises 
a problem that a correct information cannot
