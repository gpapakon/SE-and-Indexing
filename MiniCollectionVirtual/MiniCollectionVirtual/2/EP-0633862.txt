A process for checking refuse, which has been collected in a 
refuse container (12), for metal contents, 
characterized in 
that
 the refuse container (12) is screened at the refuse 
source prior to emptying and collection by a refuse collection 

vehicle (10), by means of at least one metal probe (13, 15) 
which is connected to the vehicle and which generates an 

electrical and/or acoustic and/or optical signal on detection of 
metal. 
A process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
, on 
collection of the refuse by means of a vehicle (10) with at 

least one lifting mechanism (11) for refuse containers (12) the 
respective lifting mechanism is blocked on detection of metal 

by the at least one probe (13, 15). 
A process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a code 
attached to the refuse container for identification of the refuse 

source is read and the number of metal detections in a 
specified period of time per refuse source is stored. 
A refuse vehicle, 
characterized by
 a device for examining 
refuse which has been collected in containers (12) for metal 

contents. 
A refuse vehicle according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
 
the device comprises at least one metal probe (13, 15) and 

an indicating device (25). 
A refuse vehicle according to claim 5, 
characterized in that
 
the metal probe (13, 15) and the indicating device (25) are 

connectible to the power supply of the refuse vehicle.  
 
A refuse vehicle according to claim 5 or 6, 
characterized in 
that
 the at least one metal probe (13) is a hand tool which can 
be removed from the refuse vehicle (10). 
A refuse vehicle according to one of claims 5 to 7, 
characterized 
in that
 the metal probe (15) is arranged on the refuse 
vehicle (10) in the area of a refuse-container lifting 

mechanism (11) or on the lifting mechanism (11) itself. 
A refuse vehicle according to claim 8, 
characterized in that
 
the at least one metal probe (15) is 
movably guided on the 
refuse vehicle (10) or on the lifting mechanism (11). 
A refuse vehicle according to claim 5, 6, 8 or 9, 
characterized 
in that
 the at least one metal probe (15) is coupled to 
the drive unit of a lifting mechanism (11) of the refuse vehicle 

(10). 
A refuse vehicle according to one of claims 5 to 10, 
characterized 
in that
 the at least one metal probe (13) is of annual 
design and with a diameter which is larger than the outside 

diameter of the refuse container (12). 
A refuse vehicle according to one of claims 5 to 10, 
characterized 
in that
 the at least one metal probe (15) is of 
rodshaped design, and the length of the rod corresponds at 

least with the height of the refuse container (12). 
A refuse vehicle according to one of claims 5 to 10, 
characterized 
in that
 the at least one metal probe (15) is of 
plateshaped design. 
A refuse vehicle according to one of claims 5 to 13, 
characterized  
 

in that
 the at least one metal probe (13, 15) 
generates a pulsed or continuous eddy-current field. 
A refuse vehicle according to one of claims 5 to 13, 
characterized 
in that
 the at least one metal probe (13, 15) passes 
electro-magnetic waves through the refuse container (12). 
A refuse vehicle according to one of claims 4 to 15, 
characterized 
in that
 it comprises devices (32) for compensating 
influences of metal objects outside the refuse container (12). 
A refuse vehicle according to one of claims 4 to 16, 
characterized 
in that
 it comprises a reading unit (20) for receiving a 
user and/or refuse-type identification code on a refuse 

container (12). 
A refuse vehicle according to claim 17, 
characterized in that
 
the reading unit (20) and the at least one metal probe (23) are 

connected to a data-processing unit (22) with a memory (24). 
A refuse vehicle according to one of claims 4 to 18, 
characterized 
in that
 it is connected to a label dispensing device 
(28). 
A refuse vehicle according to one of claims 5 to 19, 
characterized 
in that
 the sensitivity of the metal probe (23) and its 
selection behaviour are adjustable.
