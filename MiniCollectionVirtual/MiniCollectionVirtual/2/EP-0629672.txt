<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aqueous based paints comprising all acrylic, 
styrene/acrylic and vinyl/acrylic latexes polymerized with imidazolidinones to 
promote adhesion to alkyd substrates. Latex based paints for both indoor and outdoor use possess a number of 
advantages, such as, low odor, easy clean-up, and fast drying time, over solvent 
based paints, but they suffer from the drawback of exhibiting poor wet adhesion. The term wet adhesion is used in the paint industry to describe the ability 
of a paint to retain its adhesive bond to a substrate under wet or high humidity 
conditions. A deficiency of wet adhesion properties limits the utility of latex 
paints in areas where humid environments might be encountered, for example, 
exteriors, bathrooms and kitchens. It also makes surfaces painted with latex 
paints less scrub resistant than those painted with organic solvent based paints. The emulsion polymers used in formulating latex paints usually are all 
acrylic copolymers comprising alkyl esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid with 
minor amounts of acrylic and methacrylic acid, or they are vinyl/acrylic polymers 
comprising vinyl containing monomers or polymers in combination with softer 
acrylic monomers. The all acrylic paints produce hard coatings resistant to scrubbing and 
provide good water resistance and wet adhesion; but because of the cost of the 
acrylic monomers, they are expensive. The vinyl/acrylic paints are less 
expensive and produce films that are hard, but they tend to have a much lower wet 
adhesion than their acrylic based counterparts. In recent years improvements in wet adhesion properties have been obtained 
by the incorporation of amine, amide, and acetoacetate functionalities into the 
latex polymers. For example, cyclic ureido derivatives have been described in 
United States patents 4,104,220, 4,111,877, 4,219,454, 4,319,032 and 4,599,417 
as imparting wet adhesion properties. However, these wet adhesion monomers are  
 
very expensive and their inclusion results in a drastic increase in the cost of 
the vinyl-acrylic polymers and all-acrylic polymers used in the latex based 
paints. The present invention utilizes polymerizable imidazolidinones to impart 
excellent wet adhesion and scrub resistance properties to all acrylic and vinyl-acrylic 
latex based paints. Synthesis of these monomers is described in United 
States patent 4,577,031. These compounds have the general structure: 
 
in which 
R1 is hydrogen or a C1-C6 linear or branched alkyl group or hydroxyalkyl; X
