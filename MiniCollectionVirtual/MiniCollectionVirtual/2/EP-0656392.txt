<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to reinforced 
thermoplastic polyolefin compositions. More specifically the present invention relates to 
reinforced thermoplastic polyolefin compositions having 
improved rheological properties and suitable for the 
production of moulded articles having mechanical 
resilience properties, especially at temperatures lower 
than 0°C, which are much higher than those of corresponding 
non-reinforced polyolefin compositions. It is known that polyolefins are used in a wide 
range of applications which comprise films, fibres, 
moulded or thermoformed articles, pipes, linings etc. 
In some of these applications, especially in the 
production of articles formed by moulding, the product 
to be moulded must have properties of rigidity and/or 
shock resistance which are higher than those of the 
starting polyolefin. Many techniques for modifying the properties of  
 
polyolefins are known and described in literature; 
these comprise cross-linking of the polymer or the 
incorporation of additives, for example elastomers, or 
fillers, for example glass fibres, kaolin, mica, 
oxides, carbonates of metals of the second or third 
group of the Periodic Table, etc., in the polymeric 
matrix. Reinforced polyolefinic compositions with loads 
generally tend to have a higher rigidity with respect 
to that of the simple starting polymer as well as an 
improved dimensional stability of the end-products. It is known, however, that polyolefins, owing to 
their apolar nature, are not suited to being reinforced 
with fillers or inorganic additives; in fact, the increase 
in rigidity and dimensional stability is usually 
accompanied by a lowering of other properties such as 
impact strength, resilience, etc. To avoid this drawback proposals have made to 
modify the olefinic polymer either by grafting monomers 
having polar groups onto the hydrocarbon chain, or 
using a so-called "adhesion promoter", i.e. a compound 
which gives better adhesion or bond between the filler 
and polymeric matrix. For example English patents No. 1.110.930 and 
1.177.200 describe reinforced compositions comprising 
a polyolefin, an inorganic filler and an organo-silane  
 
containing a hydrolizable group capable of reacting 
with the hydroxylic groups present in the inorganic 
filler. Czechoslovakian patent 192.875 discloses mixtures 
of polyethylene and kaolin modified with an aminic 
silane. U.S. patent 3.956.230 describes polymeric compositions, 
for example polyolefins, reinforced with a 
filler containing hydroxylic
