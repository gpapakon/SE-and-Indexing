<ABSTRACT>
Methods and compositions for treating allergic reactions, including cutaneous, ocular, nasal and bronchial allergic disease, are disclosed. Interleukin-1 and Tumor Necrosis Factor receptors, and analogues thereof, are employed which bind the respective effector competitively and thereby suppress allergic reactions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical
compositions for the treatment of late phase inflammatory reactions, and, more
particularly, for treating bronchial asthma, rhinitis,
rhinoconjunctivitis, conjunctivitis, and dermatitis.An allergic reaction is any abnormal or altered
reaction to an antigen (or "allergen"). Typically such a
reaction is characterized by hypersensitivity of the body
to specific substances, whether protein, lipid or
carbohydrate in nature. Allergic reactions may be local,
e.g. contact dermatitis, or systemic, e.g. anaphylaxis.Among allergic diseases, bronchial asthma is one of
the most significant. In most urban hospitals, it is the
leading cause of admission of children. Current medical
practice accepts asthma in afflicted individuals to be an
unavoidable, incurable illness. While suppression of
symptoms is achieved to a degree sufficient to avoid
death, urgent medical visits, disturbed sleep, and days
lost from work are typically unavoidable.The disease is generally associated with dyspnea,
wheezing, and cough, as well as reversible airway
obstruction and airway hyperreactivity to nonspecific
stimuli. These responses have been observed in two
phases, early and late (Lemanske, Jr., R.F. and M.A.
Kaliner, In: Allergy, Principles & Practice (3rd Ed.)
pp. 224-246 (1988). See also Kaliner, M.A., Hosp. Prac.22:73 (1987); Larsen, G., Hosp. Prac.23:113 (1987)).Inhalation of allergens by sensitized subjects
typically results in an early phase response
characterized by bronchoconstriction within 10 minutes of
inhalation, reaching a maximum within 1 to 2 hours. In 
some subjects, the airway narrowing recurs after 3 to 4
hours (i.e. a late phase response), reaching a maximum
during the next few hours (O'Byrne, P.M. etal., Am. Rev.
Respir. Dis.136:740 (1987)). This late phase reaction
is thought to be due to the cellular phase of
inflammation (Hargreave, F.E. et al., Eur. J. Respir.
Dis.69(Suppl 147):16 (1986); O'Byrne, P.M., Chest90:575
(1986); Dolovich, J. et al., J. Allergy Clin. Immunol.83(Suppl):521 (1987)).No complete, long-lasting remissions of asthma have
been described in response to any existing therapeutic
strategies. For example, systemically administered
glucocorticosteroids are potent antiasthmatics; however,
the symptoms of the disease are only temporarily
suppressed and this is at the cost of well-known side
effects, including osteoporosis, weight gain,
hypertension, and diabetes (Barnes, P.J., New Eng. J.
Med. 321:1517 (1989)). Inhaled steroid therapy also has
complicatio

composition further comprises a therapeutically

effective amount of at least one corticosteroid.
The composition of claim 2, wherein said
corticosteroid is covalently bound to said IL-1 or TNF

receptors.
A hybrid fusion molecule comprising a TNF

receptor moiety and an IL-1 receptor moiety.
Use of at least one member selected from the
group consisting of IL-1 receptors, TNF receptors, and

receptor analogues thereof which are capable of
binding either IL-1 or TNF in the manufacture of a

medicament for treating tissue subject to reactions
characterised as having late phase inflammatory

responses.
Use according to claim 5 wherein the
inflammatory reaction is selected from the group

consisting of cutaneous, ocular, nasal,
gastrointestinal and bronchial reactions.
Use according to claim 5 wherein the
inflammatory reaction is selected from the group

consisting of contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, 
urticaria, conjunctivitis, rhinitis,

rhinoconjuctivitis, bronchial asthma, hay fever,
chronic bronchitis and inflammatory lung disease.
