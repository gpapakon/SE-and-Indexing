<ABSTRACT>
A lock cylinder comprises a cylinder body wherein a 
cylinder plug (1) comprising a clot (2) for the key (18) 

of the lock is rotatably arranged. The profile of the 
key slot and therefore also of the key is determined by 

profile forming elements in the form of rotation bodies 
(6,7) which are inserted in bores (4,5) extending 

through the cylinder plug (1) parallel to and adjacent 
to the middle plane (10) of the key slot (2). The 

profile elements (6,7) may be made of hardenable steel, 
for instance by turning, and may comprise a number of 

portions of different diameter so that the total number 
of key profiles obtainable becomes high while permitting 

the key profile to be made very thin and correspondingly 
difficult to copy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lock cylinder comprising 
a cylinder body wherein a cylinder plug is rotatably 
arranged, said cylinder plug being provided with bores for 
tumbler pins and comprising a slot for the key belonging to 
the lock cylinder, said key slot having at least one 
portion provided with a cross-sectional profile which is 
adapted to the profile of the key, said cross-sectional 
profile at least partly being formed by two profile elements 
constituted by rotation bodies arranged axially immovably in 
bores in the cylinder plug substantially on either side of 
the middle plane of the key slot, the profile elements 
having varying diameter and being arranged substantially 
parallel to and near the middle plane of the key slot. It is known to make the cylinder plug for different key 
profiles as an element or a major part of a lock system. 
Also for other reasons, i.a. due to safety considerations, 
it is desirable to make many different profiles. The larger 
the number of different profiles, the higher the number of 
key variations that can be made. The most common method for making key hole profiles today is 
to broach the channel with a toothed steel broach in a 
machine made especially for this purpose. The broach is 
often about one meter long and is driven through the 
cylinder plug while the teeth on the broach are cutting 
chips from the cylinder plug. This method has many 
drawbacks and deficiencies but is nevertheless the method 
most widely used today. Among the drawbacks are that the machine and broach are 
relatively expensive equipment. The long broaches are also 
cumbersome to replace in the machine and there is therefore 
a limit to the practicable number of different profiles 
(broaches) available. Another deficiency is that the key slot must have a certain 
minimum cross-section at all points determined by the  
 
strength of the teeth of the broach. The profile of the key 
slot is also in other respects shaped in accordance with the 
limits of the broach. For instance, the pitch angle of the 
grooves of the profile must be such that abrupt cross-sectional 
changes are avoided. If the profile has abrupt 
cross-sectional changes, the teeth of the broach will easily 
break. In other words, the shape is governed by the tools 
and method rather than the desired function. There is known a number of suggestions that aim at avoiding 
the above drawbacks by placing exchangeable profile 
determining elements at the front of the cylinder plug. 
However, none of these
