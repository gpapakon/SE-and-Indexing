Print substrate, especially of paper, having on one or both sides a coating which 
contains as coating-pigment ungelatinised starch grains and kaolin and optionally one or 

more further mineral pigments and also contains binder, characterised in that 

the starch grains are present in an amount of from 2 to 25 % by weight, based on 
the total coating-pigment,
