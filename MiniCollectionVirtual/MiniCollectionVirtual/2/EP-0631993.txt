<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for simultaneously pushing a number of glass objects supplied on a first transport belt at a speed v1 on to a second transport belt which runs transversely to the first transport belt and runs at a lower speed v2 than the first transport belt, with the aid of a pushing beam which carries out a movement which consists of superposed movement components in the X and Y direction, the X direction running in the transport direction of the first transport belt and the Y direction in the transport direction of the second transport belt. To reduce the movement space, the pushing beam performs its movement exclusively in the X/Y plane.
