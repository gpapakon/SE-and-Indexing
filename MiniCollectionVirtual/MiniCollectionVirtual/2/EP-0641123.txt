<ABSTRACT>
An image movement compensation apparatus (MC) 
maintaining high image quality is achieved using a filed 

memory (4) having more pixels than the number of final output 
image (Svc) which is determined according to the broad cast 

system or the system operation clock. The image movement 
compensation apparatus (MS) further has an image pick-up 

device (1) having more pixels than the filed memory (4), an 
image movement detector (5), and an image movement predictor 

(6). The image (Ia) obtained by the image pick-up device (1) 
is cropped according to the image movement predicted by the 

image movement predictor (6). The residual movement component 
left in the image (Svb) read from the image pick-up device (1) 

is then detected by the image movement detector (5), and is 
next removed by image movement compensation using the field 

memory (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image movement compensation apparatus for compensating 
the movement of an image representing an object, said apparatus comprising: a 
video signal producing means for producing a first image of said object expressed by a 
first predetermined number of pixels and reading out a second image from said first image 
to produce a first video signal, said second image being expressed by a second predetermined 
number smaller than said first predetermined number of pixels; a memory means for 
storing said first video signal; an image movement detecting means for detecting the 
movement of said second image at intervals of a predetermined period and producing a 
movement vector signal; a first control means for controlling said memory means to read 
out a third image from said second image and producing a second video signal, said third 
image being expressed by a third predetermined number smaller than said second predetermined 
number of pixels; and a second control means for controlling said image signal 
producing means to change the address from which said second image are read out. This image movement compensation apparatus is being used to compensate for handmovement 
of the image recording apparatus during recording. When subjects are imaged using an image recording 
apparatus that is held by hand or is mounted on a moving body 
such as a motor vehicle, movement of the image recording 
apparatus during recording also appears in the recorded image. 
Image movement compensation, also known as image 
stabilization, apparatuses that detect this image movement and 
adjust the recorded image position based on the detected 
movement information have therefore been developed and are 
today commonly available in consumer products. Such a conventional image movement compensation 
apparatus has been described in 
"Electronic Image Stabilizer for Video Camera Use" (T. 
Kinugasa, et al., IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, 
Vol. 36, No. 3, August 1990 (pp. 520 - 525)). Another conventional image movement compensation apparatus is disclosed in 
"Automatic Image Stabilizing System by Full-Digital Signal Processing" 
(K. Uomori, et al., IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, 
Vol. 36, No. 3, August 1990 (pp. 510 - 519)).  
 In the "Automatic Image Stabilizing System by Full-Digital 
Signal Processing" described by K. Uomori et al., 
image movement is detected from the video signal of the 
current field obtained from a solid-state image pick-up 
device, and image movement
