<ABSTRACT>
A botulinum toxin pharmaceutical composition free of blood derived albumin, comprising a botulinum toxin, sodium chloride or water and a polysaccharide such as a hydroxyethyl starch and/or an amino acid, the pharmaceutical composition being suitable for therapeutic administration to a human patient. Alternately, the polysaccharide and amino acid can be replaced by recombinant albumin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions. In
particular, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical
compositions containing a botulinum toxin and to methods for making
the pharmaceutical compositions.A pharmaceutical composition is a formulation containing one or
more active ingredients as well as one or more excipients, carriers,
stabilizers or bulking agents, which is suitable for administration to a
human patient to achieve a desired diagnostic result or therapeutic
effect.For storage stability and convenience of handling, a pharmaceutical
composition can be formulated as a lyophilized (i.e. freeze dried) or
vacuum dried powder which can be reconstituted with saline or water
prior to administration to a patient. Alternately, the pharmaceutical
composition can be formulated as an aqueous solution. A
pharmaceutical composition can contain a proteinaceous active
ingredient. Unfortunately, proteins can be very difficult to stabilize,
resulting in loss of protein and/or loss of protein activity during the
formulation, reconstitution (if required) and during the storage prior to
use of a protein containing pharmaceutical composition. Stability
problems can occur because of protein denaturation, degradation,
dimerization, and/or polymerization. Various excipients, such as
albumin and gelatin have been used with differing degrees of success
to try and stabilize a protein active ingredient present in a 
pharmaceutical composition. Additionally, cryoprotectants such as
alcohols have been used to reduce protein denaturation under the
freezing conditions of lyophilization.Albumins are small, abundant plasma proteins. Human serum
albumin has a molecular weight of about 69 kiloDaltons (kD) and has
been used as a non-active ingredient in a pharmaceutical composition
where it can serve as a bulk carrier and stabilizer of certain protein
active ingredients present in a pharmaceutical composition.The stabilization function of albumin in a pharmaceutical
composition can be present both during the multistep formulation of
the pharmaceutical composition and upon the later reconstitution of the
formulated pharmaceutical composition. Thus, stability can be
imparted by albumin to a proteinaceous active ingredient in a
pharmaceutical composition by, for example, (1) reducing adhesion
(commonly referred to as "stickiness") of the protein active ingredient to
surfaces, such as the surfaces of laboratory glassware, vessels, to the
vial in which the pharmaceutical composition is reconstituted and to the
