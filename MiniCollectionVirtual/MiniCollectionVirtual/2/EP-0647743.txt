<ABSTRACT>
A siphon for a discharging installation with an odour seal exhibits a housing (1) which exhibits a side wall (3) with a liquid-inlet opening (2) and in whose base region (4) there is provided a liquid-outlet opening (5), the odour seal exhibiting a partition wall (10) which, with the housing walls (3, 13), forms a down channel (15) leading, initially downwards, from the inlet opening (2) to the base region (4), an adjoining upwardly extending rise channel, a deflecting channel (18) which adjoins said rise channel and passes via the inlet opening (2), and finally an outflow channel which opens downwardly into the outlet opening (5) and adjoins the deflecting channel (18). In order to avoid the undesired intake of fresh liquid fed to a household appliance, as a result of a suction effect emanating from the discharging installation, the siphon is provided with an air-supply valve (25) which is known per se (Figure 1).

Concealed siphon for a discharging installation, in particular a concealed siphon for 
washing machines, comprising a housing (1) provided with an air trap, said housing being 

provided with a sidewall (3) having a liquid intake orifice (2) and being provided with a liquid 
discharge orifice (5) arranged in its bottom region (4), wherein said air trap comprises a 

partition wall (10) which with the walls (3, 11, 12, 13) of the housing forms a fall down 
conduit (15) that first leads downward from the intake orifice (2) as far as to the bottom region 

(4), an upwardly extending rising conduit (16) adjoining the same, a diverting conduit (18) 
adjoining the latter and passing above the intake orifice (2) and finally an outflow conduit (19) 

opening downwards into the discharge orifice (5) and following upon the diverting conduit 
(18), characterized in that the siphon is provided with a ventilation valve (25) known per se 

and that there is provided a covering hood (29) surrounding the ventilation valve (25) at a 
distance (30). 
Siphon according to claim 1, characterized in that the ventilation valve (25) is mounted 
on a pipe connection (27) opening into the interior of the housing. 
Siphon according to claim 2, characterized in that the ventilation valve (25) is 
provided with a section of pipe (26) equipped with an O-ring seal (26') and by this section of 

pipe (26) is inserted in the pipe connection (27) and is fixed thereto by means of a union nut 
(26"). 
Siphon according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that the pipe connection (27) by one 
orifice (24) opens at least partially into a descending leg (18') of the diverting conduit (18) 

and/or the outflow conduit (19) connected thereto. 
Siphon according to one or several of claims 2 to 4, characterized in that to the intake 
orifice (2) there is connected a roughly horizontal intake connection (6) projecting outward 

from the housing (1) and that the pipe connection (27) is arranged so as to be partially 
supported at the housing (1) and partially at the intake connection (6). 
Siphon according to one or several of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the covering 
hood (29) by means of a snap connection (33, 34) is attached to retention elements (32) 

arranged at the housing (1) and projecting outward from the same.  
 
Siphon according to one or several of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the covering 
hood (29) is open toward the front, that is, toward the sidewall (3) of the housing (1), at which 

the intake orifice (2) or the intake connection (6) attached to the intake orifice (2) are 
arranged. 
Siphon according to one or several of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that there is 
provided a protective hood (35) covering the covering hood (29) and at least the portion of the 

housing (1) that carries the intake orifice (2) or the intake connection (6) connected to the 
intake orifice (2). 
Siphon according to claim 8, characterized in that the protective hood (35) comprises a 
free rim (36) by which it can be slid over the covering hood (29) and at least partially over the 

housing (1). 
Siphon according to claim 8 or 9, characterized in that sidewalls of the protective hood 
(35) are provided with several grooves (39) that are parallel with respect to each other and 

with respect to the front wall (37) of the protective hood (35). 
Siphon according to one or several of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the grooves 
(39) are interrupted by slot-like recesses (39') piercing the sidewalls. 
Siphon according to one or several of claims 1 to 11, characterized in that there is 
provided a covering plate (41) which has an orifice (42) for the passage of an intake 

connection (6) connected to the intake orifice (2) and which is fixable by means of a nut (43) 
that screws onto the intake connection (6), wherein the nut (43) by a ring-shaped distance 

flange (44) is rested against the covering plate (41) and the covering plate (41) is provided 
with one or several air passage opening(s) (45) disposed behind the nut (43) and peripherally 

surrounding the opening (42) of the intake connection as well as the distance flange (44) of 
the nut (43). 
Siphon according to one or several of claims 1 to 12, characterized in that, starting 
from the bottom region (4) of the housing (1), the anterior sidewall (13) of the housing (1), 

which wall is provided with the intake orifice (2), is arranged so as to be inclined backwards 
towards the rear wall (13) of the housing (1), accompanied by a narrowing of the cross section 

of said housing (1).
