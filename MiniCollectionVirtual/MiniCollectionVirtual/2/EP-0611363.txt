Automatic bobbin-changing device (10) for winding machines 
with a vertical winding axis, in which bobbins (1, 2) are wound, 

which comprise a winding core (1c, 2c) as well as a lower flange 
(1b, 2b) and which is provided for winding and unwinding rod-like 

material, such as wire, wire coils, strands, glass fibres and the 
like, the bobbin-changing device comprising a bobbin-carrying 

device (12) able to rotate about a vertical axis (13) and which 
is vertically adjustable by means of a lifting device (54, 55), 

which device (12) comprises a first bobbin-holding position for 
holding a first bobbin (1), as well as a second bobbin-holding 

position for holding a second bobbin (2), this second bobbin-holding 
position being staggered by approximately 180° with 

respect to the first bobbin-holding position, characterised in 
that the bobbin-carrying device (12) comprises a first gripping 

arm (20), a second gripping arm (26), a third gripping arm (27) 
and a fourth gripping arm (28) each with a first inner end, which 

is mounted to rotate in the vicinity of this vertical axis, the 
axis of rotation of each gripping arm being parallel to this 

vertical axis, that located at the outer end of each gripping arm 
(25, 26, 27, 28) is at least one bobbin support (29), that a 

driving device (36, 38) is provided, which brings about a rotary 
movement of these gripping arms about these axes of rotation, 

that the first and the second gripping arm (25, 26) are connected 
to each other by way of a coupling device (34) so that they hold 

the first bobbin with these bobbin supports (29) in this first 
bobbin-holding position, that the third and fourth gripping arm 

(27, 28) are connected to each other by way of a coupling device 
(34) so that they hold this second bobbin (2) with these bobbin 

supports (29) in the second bobbin-holding position, that a 
control device is provided, which controls the bobbin-changing 

device, this control device, these gripping arms, this lifting 
device and this driving device being provided so that this first 

bobbin is gripped, in that the first and the second gripping arm 
(25, 26) is moved with respect to the first bobbin so that the 

bobbin support (29) engages below the lower flange (1b) of the  
 

bobbin (1), that the second bobbin is gripped, in that the third 
gripping arm and the fourth gripping arm (27, 28) is moved with 

respect to the second bobbin so that the bobbin support (29) 
engages below the lower flange (2b) of the second bobbin (2), and 

that for carrying out the bobbin change, the bobbin-carrying 
device (12) with the four gripping arms altogether is lifted by 

the lifting device (54, 55), tilted about the latter by 
approximately 180° and lowered. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that each 
gripping arm (25, 26, 27, 28) is non-rotatably connected to a 

pinion (34), which is arranged so that it meshes with the 
corresponding pinion of the gripping arm associated kinematically 

with this gripping arm. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterised in that these 
two gripping arms (25, 26; 27, 28) associated kinematically with 

each other are connected to each other by a double-acting 
piston/cylinder unit (36; 38) so that upon actuation of the 

piston/cylinder unit, the two gripping arms can be moved away 
from each other and towards each other. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that all 
four gripping arms are kinematically connected to each other. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
kinematic connection of the gripping arms is brought about by 

four gear wheels, which are each arranged concentrically with 
respect to the axis of rotation of the gripping arms and are non-rotatably 

connected to the latter, the gear wheels of adjacent 
gripping arms meshing with each other. 
Device according to Claim 4 or 5, characterised in that 
a double-acting piston/cylinder unit is provided, which is 

connected to two gripping arms, in order to bring about a tilting 
movement of all four gripping arms.  

 
Device according to at least one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the bobbin supports (29) are respectively 

connected to a jaw (30), which bears against the outer diameter 
of the bobbin flange (1b, 2b), when the support is positioned 

below the bobbin flange. 
Device according to at least one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the lifting movement is brought about by 

two piston/cylinder units (54, 55), which are arranged 
symmetrically with respect to this vertical axis. 
Device according to at least one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the rotation of the bobbin-carrying device 

(12) about this vertical axis (13) is brought about by a rotary 
cylinder (62). 
Device according to at least one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the tilting angle of the gripping arms is 

dimensioned such that the opening angle between two kinematically 
associated gripping arms (25, 26; 27, 28) amounts to 

approximately 180°.
