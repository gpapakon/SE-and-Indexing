<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor substrate (48) and a block of optical 
quartz (50) are simultaneously polished. An interferometer (22), 

in conjunction with a data processing system (16), are then used 
to monitor the thickness and the polishing rate of the optical 

quartz block. This allows the endpoint of the polishing process to 
be automatically and reproducibly detected, and it also allows the 

polishing rate of the semiconductor substrate (48) to be 
automatically adjusted during the polishing process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to integrated circuits, and 
more specifically to a polishing process for the formation of 
semiconductor integrated circuits. Polishing processes, and more specifically chemical-mechanical 
polishing processes, have been used in the 
semiconductor industry to prepare both single crystal substrates 
and silicon on insulator substrates. In addition, chemical-mechanical 
polishing processes have also been used to planarize 
various conductive and insulating layers subsequently deposited 
on these substrates, during the integrated circuit fabrication 
process. For example, chemical-mechanical polishing has been 
used to planarize interlevel dielectric layers that lie in between 
two different levels of metal interconnect. Planarizing the 
interlevel dielectric layer, prior to the formation of the next 
level of interconnect, is highly desirable because it allows the 
next level of interconnect to be subsequently patterned and 
etched without the formation of conductive metal stringers, 
which can electrically short adjacent metal lines, and without 
the formation of thinned or notched metal lines, which can 
adversely effect device reliability. In addition, chemical-mechanical 
polishing has also been used to form trench isolation. 
In this process, trenches are formed and then subsequently filled 
with a deposited dielectric layer, such as silicon dioxide. The 
dielectric layer is then polished back to form dielectric filled 
isolation trenches, which are nearly planar with the adjacent 
active regions. In addition to being planar, the resulting trench 
isolation is also desirable because it allows the space separating 
adjacent active regions to be minimized, and thus allows 
integrated circuits with high device packing densities to be 
fabricated. Unfortunately, it is difficult to accurately and reproducibly 
polish semiconductor substrates, and the materials subsequently 
deposited on them. One of the main reasons for this difficulty is  
 
that accurate endpoint determination, or detecting when a given 
polishing process should be stopped, is difficult to achieve. As a 
result, the materials being polished may be either under-polished 
or over-polished. Both of these results may adversely effect the 
functionality of an integrated circuit. For example, if the 
interlevel dielectric layer lying between the two levels of metal 
interconnect is over-polished, then its thickness may be 
insufficient to prevent the two levels of interconnect from being 
electrically shorted
