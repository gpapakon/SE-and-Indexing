<ABSTRACT>
A chuck mechanism is described, which is easy to 
handle with a chuck clamping handle (32) of increased 

diameter and is capable of achieving smooth movement of 
its reciprocally movable portion of reduced weight and 

assures safe operation with the least exposure of 
outwardly moving portion. Rotating a knurled portion (32a) 

of a body case (32) rotates an intermediate transmission 
member (33) which in turn rotates a slide shaft stopping 

member (30) to tighten or loosen its engagement with a slide 
shaft, causing clamping or releasing a collet chuck (31). 

The slide shaft, slide shaft locking member, chuck and 
a saw can reciprocally move as a single unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chuck mechanism 
and more particularly to a chuck mechanism for 
removably chucking a jig on a reciprocally-movable 
member. In dental treatment, tooth cutting is carried out by 
using a cutting tool to be driven by a micromotor 
rotating at high speed. In recent years, with the 
progress of subdivision of medical areas and 
specialization of medical technology, there have 
appeared specialists being engaged, for example, in 
medical treatment of hands or feet only. In medical 
treatment of hands or feet, it is also necessary to 
carry out operations such as bone amputation or 
cutting, but no cutting device which is suitable for 
use in medical treatment of hands or feet, has been 
developed. Every specialist feels inconvenienced not 
having it. In view of the foregoing, the present applicant 
previously proposed a cutting device which is suitable 
for amputating and/or cutting fine bones of hands and 
feet of human and animals. The proposed cutting device 
has a chuck mechanism for converting rotational  
 
movement of a shaft into linear reciprocal movement of 
a member reciprocally movable in an axial direction of 
the shaft and for removably chucking a jig to the 
reciprocally movable member to conduct various kinds of 
operation by use of the jig. In the above-mentioned cutting device, the chuck 
clamping member has an increased diameter to be easily 
tightened or loosened when mounting or removing of a 
saw in or from the chuck. However, provided that the 
chuck clamping member has a small diameter, it is hard 
to handle the chuck to clamp or release when mounting 
or removing of the sawing plate in or from the chuck. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a chuck mechanism comprising of a chuck clamping member 
having a grasping portion of a large diameter which is 
easy to handle when clamping or releasing a collet 
chuck and the reciprocating portion which has a reduced 
mass to ensure a smooth movement. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a chuck mechanism which is safe to use by its 
moving portion of a least partial exposure. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a chuck mechanism which has a small diameter  
 
not to hit a part of human body or animal's body or 
other object during the medical treatment. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a chuck mechanism which is useful for cutting 
device used for amputating and/or cutting bones of 
human and animals or other kinds of

<CLAIMS>
A chuck mechanism for converting rotational movement 
of a shaft into linear reciprocal movement of a member 

reciprocally movable in an axial direction of the shaft 
and removably chucking a jig (10) to the reciprocally 

movable member to conduct various kinds of operation by 
use of the jig, which comprises a chucking mechanism 

for removably securing the reciprocally movable member, 
said mechanism including an externally threaded slide 

shaft whereto the reciprocal movement is transmitted, a 
collet chuck (31), a slide shaft locking member (30) 

accommodating the collet chuck (31) therein and having a 
head (30a) for clamping the collet chuck at one end and an 

internally threaded portion at the other end for 
threadedly engaging with the slide shaft (29), characterized in 

that a body 
case (32) which is secured to the slide shaft locking means (30) 

to be movable in an axial direction but not to be 
rotatable in a circumferential direction thereof and is 

secured to a fixing member not to be movable in an 
axial direction but to be rotatable in a 

circumferential direction thereof, 
and that clamping and releasing collet chuck may be 

achieved by adjusting the threaded engagement between 
the slide shaft (29) and the slide shaft locking member (30) by 

rotating the body case (32) against the fixing member.  
 
A chuck mechanism according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that a periphery of the collet chuck 

clamping head of the body case is knurled. 
A chuck mechanism according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the slide shaft has a hexagonal 

external profile and the body case has a hexagonal 
internal profile and they are coupled with each other 

to be relatively movable in the axial direction but not 
to be relatively rotatable in the circumferential 

direction. 
A chuck mechanism for converting rotational movement 
of a shaft into linear reciprocal movement of a m
ember 
reciprocally movable in an axial direction of the shaft 

and removably chucking an cutting tool (10) to the 
reciprocally movable member to conduct cutting and/or 

amputating operation by use of the tool, which 
comprises a chucking mechanism for removably securing 

the reciprocally movable member, said mechanism 
including an externally threaded slide shaft whereto 

the reciprocal movement is transmitted, a collet chuck, 
a slide shaft locking member accommodating the collet 

chuck therein and having a head for clamping the collet 
chuck at one end and an internally threaded portion at 

the other end for threadedly engaging with the slide 
shaft, characterized in that a body case which is secured to the slide 

shaft locking means to be movable in an axial direction  
 

but not to be rotatable in a circumferential direction 
thereof and is secured to a fixing member not to be 

movable in an axial direction but to be rotatable in a 
circumferential direction thereof, 

and that clamping and releasing collet chuck may be 
achieved by adjusting the threaded engagement between 

the slide shaft and the slide shaft locking member by 
rotating the body case against the fixing member. 
A chuck mechanism according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the cutting tool is a sawing 

plate.
