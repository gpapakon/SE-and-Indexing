<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preheating of scrap, in which gaseous media are heated up by afterburned and purified flue gas. In this case, the flue gas is afterburned at more than 1200@C and the hot gases are passed, unpurified, through a heat exchanger, by means of which external air drawn in is heated up, and the hot air is then divided, one part being passed through the scrap and another part being made available as hot air to the afterburner and/or being admixed to the afterburned hot gases.

A method for preheating scrap, in which gaseous 
media are heated using the sensible heat of flue gas 

which is after-burned in a combustion chamber and is 
then purified in a filter,
 
characterised by the following steps: 


a) the flue gas is after-burned at a temperature 
above 1200°C; 
b) the after-burned hot gases are guided, unpurified, 
through a heat exchanger; 
c) in the heat exchanger, freshly drawn-in external 
air is heated with the sensible heat of the after-burned 

hot gases; 
d) a first portion of the hot air is passed, at a 
temperature which is above the ignition 

temperature of organic substances, adjustably in 
terms of quantity through at least one basket 

filled with scrap; 
e) another portion of the hot air leaving the heat 
exchanger is made available to the after-burner as 

hot air, adjustably in terms of quantity, and/or 
is admixed to the after-burned hot gases. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that additionally gaseous substances and/or oxygen are 

supplied to the burned gases and the hot air in the 
combustion chamber.  

 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the hot air leaving the heat exchanger is supplied 

to the scrap at a temperature of above 500°C. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the hot gases leaving the combustion chamber are 

passed through already preheated scrap in an additional 
scrap preheating station. 
A method according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that the after-burned hot gases are passed through the 

scrap preheating stations filled with preheated scrap 
before flowing through the heat exchanger. 
A plant for performing the method according to 
Claim 1, comprising a scrap melting furnace, a 

combustion chamber in which the flue gas of the furnace 
can be after-burned, at least one scrap preheating 

station and a filter means connected to the combustion 
chamber via a flue gas line, characterised in that a 

heat exchanger (24) is provided in the flue gas line 
(21) between the combustion chamber (22) and the filter 

means (29), through which exchanger a fresh air line 
(32) passes, to which the scrap preheating station (40) 

is connected with at least one scrap basket (41), 
that an exhaust gas line (37) is connected to the scrap 

basket (41), which line leads to a combustion chamber 
(52) arranged separately from the combustion chamber 

(22) and through which the flue gas from the scrap 
preheating stage (40) can be passed, 

that a heat exchanger (54) is provided in the direction 
of flow after the combustion chamber (52), through 

which exchanger a fresh air line (62) passes which is 
connected to the scrap preheating stage (42) in 

parallel or alternately with fresh air line (32).  
 
A plant according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that an additional scrap basket (44) is arranged 

parallel to the scrap basket (41), and that fittings 
(38, 39) are provided which permit switching to 

individual or parallel operation of the scrap baskets 
(41, 44) in each case. 
A plant according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that gate valves (34, 64) are provided in the fresh air 

lines (32, 62). 
A plant according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that fittings (36, 66) are arranged in the fresh air 

lines (32, 62), which fittings guide the heated fresh 
air to the scrap baskets (41, 44) and/or to a branch 

(33) and from there into the combustion chamber (52) or 
into the flue gas line (51) after the burner (52). 
A plant according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that a scrap basket (42) is provided which is connected 

via a bypass line (43) provided with fittings (46, 47) 
to the flue gas line (51) which bears a fitting (58). 
A plant according to Claim 10, characterised in 
that the bypass line (43) is connected to the flue gas 

line (51) in the region between the combustion chamber 
(52) and the heat exchanger (54).
