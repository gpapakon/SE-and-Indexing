<ABSTRACT>
Transplants are coated with an insoluble immunological barrier membrane. The membrane can comprise a non-cytotoxic first layer of agarose and cationic amino acid polymer and a non-cytotoxic second layer chemically bonded to said first layer, the second layer comprising an anionic amino acid polymer. The molecular weight of the anionic amino acid polymer is preferably in the range of 2,000 to 500,000 daltons, and the thickness of the total membrane coating is within the range of 1 and 100 microns. Alternatively, the membrane can comprise a non-cytotoxic first layer of a cationic amino acid polymer. A non-cytotoxic second layer chemically bonded to the first layer comprises agarose and an anionic amino acid polymer. A non-cytotoxic optional third layer chemically bonded to said second layer comprises a cationic amino acid polymer. The molecular weight of the cationic acid polymer of the third layer is in the range of from 2,000 to 500,000 daltons and the thickness of the total coating is between 1 and 100 microns. The transplants can be allografts of endocrine cells or tissues such as pancreatic islets. The preferred cationic amino acids are L-lysine, poly-L-arginine, and mixtures thereof, and the preferred anionic amino acids are L-aspartic acid, L-glutamic acid, and mixtures thereof. The coatings are formed by applying corresponding successive solutions to the cells or tissue of the transplant and by forming droplets in immiscible oils.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of medical
transplants of cells and tissues and their manufacture.
More particularly, it relates to transplants that have been
coated with an immunological barrier comprising agarose to
render them suitable for transplantation and processes for
their manufacture.Transplants between immunologically incompatible
individuals (called xenografts when the donor and recipient
or host are of different species or allografts when the
donor and recipient are of the same species) normally
induce an immune response in the recipient individual. The
immune response often leads to rejection or destruction of
the transplant or, if the transplant contains
immunocompetent cells, to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).Various techniques have been used in an attempt to
reduce or eliminate the immunogenicity of transplants. For
instance, transplants have been manipulated by culturing
under conditions that cause selective elimination or
deactivation of cells that stimulate the immune response or
by treating the transplant with antisera that recognize
receptors on such cells as disclosed in Transplantation
Proceedings (1982) 14 (4) : 714-723. Pancreatic islets have
also been placed in semipermeable polymeric containers,
called "diffusion pouches" in attempts to make an
artificial pancreas as described in Diabetes (1977)
26:1136-9 and Trans.Am.Soc.Artif.Intern.Organs. (1979)
25:74-76. Biological objects have also been passively
trapped in a gel which has no affinity for the living
biological object tissue. The gel layer must necessarily
be thick in order to completely surround the biological
object. U.S. Patent No. 4,663,286 (Tsang et al.) discloses a
gel system wherein viable cells are encapsulated using an
alginate polymer. The gel layer is subsequently crosslinked
with a polycationic polymer such as polylysine. A
second membrane layer can be formed by contacting the
capsules with a second polycationic polymer, such as
polyornithine solution, or by exposure to a more highly
charged density polymer such as polyvinyl amine. The
second layer can, in turn be coated with alginate.U.S. Patent Nos. 4,806,355, 4,689,293, and 4,673,566
to Goosen et al., describe the microencapsulation of islets
in a hydrogel for subsequent transplantation. The
microcapsules are composed of an alginate first layer which
is crossed-linked using a polyamino acid such as
polylysine. Finally, a second outer, negatively charged
gel layer is present and is preferably composed of sodium
alginate.U.S. Patent Nos. 4,409,331,
