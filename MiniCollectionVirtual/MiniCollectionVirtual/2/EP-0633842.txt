<ABSTRACT>
An envelope opening mechanism for an inserter apparatus comprises post-like abutments (25) against which envelopes (10) are successively fed, with the hinge edge leading, over a guide surface (22) with an inclined portion (24), to initiate envelope flap opening movement by buckling of the envelope. Additionally or instead the posts (25) can be movable downwardly to engage head portions (27) thereof with the flap portion. The envelopes are then fed in the direction of the hinge edge past and edge member (30) shaped to enter between the envelope flap and body portions and to complete the flap movement into alignment with the body portion for reception of insert material at an insert station (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an envelope opening mechanism
for an inserter apparatus, that is, an apparatus for
effecting insertion of desired insert material into each of a
series of envelopes.Such apparatus comprises conveyor means defining a flow
path along which envelopes are conveyed successively from a
stack or other supply source through an opener station, at
which each envelope is opened, to an insert station at which
desired insert material, comprising one or more items usually
in the form of printed cards or sheets, which may or may not
be folded, is placed inside each opened envelope. The filled
or loaded envelope is then conveyed from the insert station
to be closed, and sealed if required.Where the insert material is to comprise a plurality of
items, a second conveyor means can be provided along which
the two or more insert items are assembled into a stack, as
by depositing, on each first item, the or each additional
item from separate feeder devices, some or all of which can
include folding equipment, located along the flow path
provided by the second conveyor means. This path ends at the
insert station, where each assembled stack is loaded into a
respective envelope carried there by the first-mentioned
conveyor means.The envelopes typically comprise panels folded and
secured together to form a rectangular pocket or body portion
open along one edge at which an integrally formed flap
portion is hinged. The flap portion may be generally
triangular or rectangular with end edges converging away from
the body portion. Initially, the flap portion overlies the
body portion, so to enable insert material to be loaded into
the body portion, the envelope has to be opened, by turning
of the flap portion about the hinge line to a position at 
which the flap portion extends at least approximately in
the plane of the panel of the body portion with which it
is integrally formed. The opening mechanism of an
inserter apparatus is of course required to operate
reliably, and is desirably simple in construction.US 3 474 711 discloses an apparatus in which opening
of the flap is effected by conveying the envelope past a
bevelled roller, which presses on the hinge to effect
initial opening of the envelope, and then past a shaped
unfolding element.According to the present invention there is provided
an envelope opening mechanism for envelopes each having a
body portion and a flap portion overlying the body
portion and hinged thereto along a hinge edge of the
envelope, the opening mechanism comprising conveyor means

<CLAIMS>
An envelope opening mechanism for envelopes each
having a body portion and a flap portion overlying the

body portion and hinged thereto along a hinge edge of the
envelope, the opening mechanism comprising conveyor means

(5,6) for moving each envelope (10) firstly to engage a
first device (25, 27), the first device being arranged to

cause buckling of the envelope and consequential initial
opening movement of the flap portion relative to the body

portion and subsequently to a second device (30) arranged
to effect sufficient opening movement of the flap portion

relative to the body portion to permit entry of insert
material into the body portion, characterized in that the

conveyor means (5,6) is arranged to move each envelope
(10) to engage the first device with the hinge edge

leading.
A mechanism as claimed in claim 1 wherein the first
device comprises abutment means (25) and a support (22,

24) for the envelope upstream of the abutment means, the
support having a portion (24) shaped to promote the

buckling of the envelope.
A mechanism as claimed in claim 2 wherein the
support portion (24) provides a support surface for the

envelope which is inclined downwardly in the direction of
envelope movement towards the abutment means (25).
A mechanism as claimed in claim 3 wherein the
abutment means (25) has a head portion (27) which

overlies the flap portion (11) of the envelope, the
abutment means being movable so as to engage the head

portion with the flap portion to bend the part of the 
body adjacent the flap portion towards the downwardly

inclined support portion (24).
A mechanism as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein the first device is arranged to engage the flap

portion to effect the initial opening movement by causing
buckling of the envelope.
A mechanism as claimed in claim 5 wherein the first
device comprises a member (27) movable to cause the

buckling of the envelope adjacent the hinge over an edge
between relatively inclined support surfaces (22, 24) for

the envelope.
A mechanism as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein the movement of the envelope to the second device

is substantially in the direction of the hinge edge of
the envelope.
A mechanism as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein the conveyor means (5, 6) is arranged to move the

envelope (10) to the second device in a direction
laterally of the direction of movement to the first

device.
A mechanism as claimed in any one of claims 1-8
wherein the second device comprises an opening member

(30) having a first portion arranged to enter between the
flap and body portions (31), a second portion (35)

providing an edge (34) engageable with the flap portion
to effect progressive opening thereof relative to the

body portion and a third portion (36) maintaining the
flap portion in the opened position caused by the second 

portion.
A mechanism as claimed in claim 9 wherein the second
portion edge (34) is inclined to the direction of

relative movement in a direction from the envelope body
portion to the flap portion.
A mechanism as claimed in claim 9 or 10 wherein the
second portion edge (34) is curved upwardly away from the

envelope body portion and the third portion (36) is
inclined downwardly from the second portion (35).
