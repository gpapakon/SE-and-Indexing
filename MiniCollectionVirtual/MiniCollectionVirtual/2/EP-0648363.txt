<ABSTRACT>
An electronic information aid displays and calculates the relationships between a series of individual integers which may comprise alphabetical and/or numerical indicia or a series of visual and/or aural indicia or a combination of any one or more of the integers. The aid has a number of reference rings (23a-23g) each of which is independently rotatable but maintained in a predetermined spatial relationship with each other. Each reference ring (23) includes a number of segments each of which displays indicia which corresponds to an integer. When the rings (23a-23g) are rotated so the segments are aligned into an active strip in accordance with a coding system, the segments will display the interrelationship between the integers. Each segment within the active strip can be activated to initiate an aural or a visual response.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electronic information aid. In particular the device 
relates to an aid which can be used to assist in the display and calculation of the relationships 
between a series of individual integers and which can provide an aural or visual reproduction 
of a specific integer and/or the relationship between integers. The integers may comprise 
alphabetical and/or numerical indicia or they may comprise a series of visual and/or aural indicia 
or a combination of any one or more of the integers. In a highly preferred form, the invention relates to a device which can be used 
to assist in the calculation of various forms of musical scales and which can display the scales 
in all keys simultaneously and which can provide an aural reproduction of a selected musical 
note or a series of notes or a chord of musical notes of the calculated scales. One form of 
device which will provide a visual reproduction of the relationship between musical notes is 
described in United States Patent Specification 4,134,326. Such a device had a number of 
annular rings rotatably mounted on an axle. The names of the notes of the musical scale were 
printed on the peripheral surface of each ring so that when the rings are appropriately aligned, 
musical relationships can be determined. The primary purpose of this prior art device is to 
assist in the transposition of chords. To use the device, the key or tonic note for a particular 
chord is selected on a particular ring and each successive ring is aligned with the other notes 
on the chord. The rings are then locked in place and the rings rotated as a unit so the 
corresponding type of chord of another key can be read off the device with the assistance of a 
moveable viewing screen.  
 In British Patent Specification 2119154A there is described a musical scale indicator 
having two faces. One face the obverse face and is comprised of eight concentric circles which 
overlap each other. The circles are divided into twelve segments of each size and each segment 
is marked with the name of a note or notes. The second face, the reverse face has a window 
through which a number corresponding to the name of the note on the obverse face can be 
viewed. United States Patent Specification 4961362 describes a device which can be used 
to calculate the chord and key construction for a musical composition. This device uses a fixed 
wheel which has a number of segments which contain indicia. Specific segments can be viewed 
through a window in a window mask which is

<CLAIMS>
An electronic information aid comprising: 

a plurality of reference rings (23) each of which is 
independently movable and maintained in a predetermined spatial 

relationship, each reference ring (23) having a plurality of 
segments (28) each of which is identifiable by a predetermined 

coding system, an indicator (50) such that when selected 
segments (28) of the reference rings (23) are aligned with 

respect to said indicator and in accordance with the 
predetermined coding system into an array of aligned segments, 

the aligned segments will occupy and form an active strip and 
can then operate as an active strip; 
activation means (29) where one or more of only the 
segments in the array of aligned segments are activatable; and 
response means wherein a visual or audible response can be 
initiated by the activation of one or more of only the segments 

in the array of aligned segments. 
The information aid of claim 1, wherein each segment (28) 
displays indicia representing a musical note on the chromatic 

scale, the construction and arrangement being that when the 
segments (28) are aligned in the array of segments in 

accordance with the coding system, the segments within the 
array will represent the notes of a musical scale. 
The information aid of any one of claims 1 or 2, including 
more than one array of segments (28). 
The information aid of claims 2 and 3, wherein when the 
segments (28) are aligned in the array of segments to represent 

the notes of the musical scale, corresponding segments (28) of 
each successive ring (23) will also represent the notes of a 

musical scale.  
 
The information aid of any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein 
the audible response comprises the production of a single note. 
The information aid of claim 5, wherein the audible 
response includes a tone program which comprises the production 

of a series of notes. 
The information aid of claim 5, wherein the audible 
response includes a tone program which comprises the production 

of a chord. 
The information aid of any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein 
the predetermined coding system comprises a unique tactile 

pattern applied to each of the segments (28). 
The information aid of any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein each reference ring (23) comprises a sleeve mounted for 

individual rotation on a housing (20), means (20a and 20b) 
being provided on the housing (20) to maintain each reference 

ring (23) in a predetermined spatial relationship with the 
remainder of the reference rings (23). 
The information aid of any one of claims 1 to 9, wherein 
the means to produce an audible response comprises a software 

program having a chordal mode of operation, a sequence mode of 
operation and a play mode of operation.  

 
The information aid as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims including a metronome facility. 
The information aid as claimed in claim 11 wherein the 
metronome facility acts as a time controller.
