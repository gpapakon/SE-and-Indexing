<ABSTRACT>
A liquid antithrombin III (AT-III) preparation comprising AT-III and a stabilizer such as an organic acid, 
a salt thereof, a sugar sulfate or a surfactant, and having a pH value of 9 to 10. It is stable even when stored for 

long and is clinically nonproblematic at all in respect of both the pharmacological effect and the safety. Further it is 
advantageous in that it can readily be administered because it need not be dissolved in distilled water for injection 

unlike dried preparations. Therefore this preparation is extremely useful from the clinical viewpoint.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid preparation of 
antithrombin-III, which is stable during a long-term storage, 
and a method for stabilizing the liquid preparation of 
antithrombin-III. An antithrombin-III (hereinafter referred to as AT-III) is 
a kind of sugar protein belonging to α₂ globulin present in 
plasma and has a molecular weight of 65,000-68,000. An AT-III 
has a protease inhibitory activity and shows a strong inhibitory 
action on coagulation activity of thrombin, as well as an 
inhibitory action on other blood coagulation factors, activated 
X factor, activated IX factor and the like. It has been 
reported that AT-III also shows an inhibitory action on plasmin 
and trypsin. These inhibitory actions are known to generally 
proceed faster in the presence of heparin. An AT-III having such pharmacological actions is used for 
the correction of abnormally enhanced coagulation, specifically 
for the treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation 
(DIC). AT-III shows poor stability when dissolved and causes 
side effects in intravenous administration by polymerizing. 
Accordingly, AT-III has been formulated into lyophilized 
preparations.  Incidentally, liquid preparations are more advantageous 
than lyophilized preparations in that they do not require 
dissolution in injectable distilled water when in use, thus 
making administration easy, and are produced economically with 
no need for a freeze-dry step in the production thereof. 
However, practical formulation of AT-III into liquid 
preparations has gotten behind due to the poor stability of AT-III 
in a solution state. There has been only one report in the 
field of reagent that confirms possible 7 day storage of AT-III 
in a solution state at 4°C in the presence of heparin (Japanese 
Patent Unexamined Publication No. 103463/1980). An object of the present invention is to improve the 
stability of AT-III in a solution state and provide a liquid 
preparation of AT-III, which permits a long-term storage, 
stability during a long-term storage, particularly at a 
temperature ranging from 4°C to room temperature, and easy 
administration thereof. Another object of the present 
invention is to provide a method for improving the stability of 
a liquid AT-III preparation during storage. With the aim of solving the aforementioned problems in the 
prior art, the present inventors have conducted a wide range of 
studies regarding stabilization of AT-III in a solution state, 
and found that the use of an organic acid, a salt thereof, a 
sugar
