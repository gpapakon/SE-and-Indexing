<ABSTRACT>
A liquid 
crystal display element (12) is disposed between a pair of 

polarizing plates (10,11). The liquid crystal display 
element (12) is of a TN type, the liquid crystal molecules 

of which are oriented with a twist of 90° between a pair of 
light transmitting substrates (2,3). The product d·Δn of 

the thickness d of a liquid crystal layer (9) and the 
refractive anisotropy Δn of the liquid crystal molecules is 

selected from values in the range of from 1.80 to 2.00 µm. 
The angle α contained by an orientation axis of the liquid 

crystal molecules closest to one (2) of the pair of light 
transmitting substrates (2,3) and an absorption axis of one 

(10) of the pair of polarizing plates (10,11) is set to be 
in the range of from -5 to 5°, and the angle β contained 

by an orientation axis of the liquid crystal molecules 
closest to the other (3) of the pair of light transmitting 

substrates (2,3) and an absorption axis of the other (11) of 
the pair of the polarizing plates (10,11) is set to be in 

the range of from 85 to 95°. Consequently, not only the 
color change in relation to a viewing angle, but also the 

coloring due to the ununiformity of liquid crystal layer 

thicknesses is decreased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a twisted nematic
(hereinafter described as "TN") type liquid crystal display
device, which is preferably applied to black-and-white
display means of various equipment mounted on vehicles.Fig. 12 is a sectional view illustrating the
constitution of a liquid crystal display device 21 of the
prior art. The liquid crystal display device 21 comprises
light transmitting substrates 22, 23, transparent electrodes
24, 25, an adhesive material 26, a liquid crystal layer 27
and polarizing plates 28, 29. The light transmitting
substrates 22, 23 (e.g., made of glass) are disposed so that
one surface 22a of the light transmitting substrate 22 and
one surface 23a of the transmitting substrate 23 are opposed
to each other. The liquid crystal layer 27 is interposed
between the substrates 22, 23, which are bonded by the 
adhesive material 26. At least the transparent electrodes
24 are formed on the inner surface of any one of the two
substrates 22, 23. Herein, for convenience of explanation,
the substrate 22 is considered as one substrate where the
transparent electrodes 24 are formed and the surface 22a is
considered as the inner surface. The transparent electrodes
24 are of, for example, a segment type shaping a character.
On the other hand, irregularities are formed on the entire
of the inner surface 23a of the other substrate 23 and
besides the transparent electrode 25 is formed thereon. The
transparent electrode 25 is a common electrode which is
formed, for example, on the entire of the inner surface 23a
of the substrate 23.Orientation treatment is applied to the inner surface
22a of the substrate 22 on which the transparent electrode
24 are formed and to the surface of the transparent
electrode 25. The orientation treatment includes rubbing
treatment of a surface coated with an organic material
(e.g., polyimide resin) and formation of an inorganic film
by oblique evaporation coating. Liquid crystal molecules
27a of the liquid crystal layer 27 are oriented in a
predetermined direction by the orientation treatment.
Further, liquid crystal molecules 27b which are the closest
to the irregular surface 23a of the substrate 23 are
oriented along the irregularities in one direction as shown 
in Fig. 12. The polarizing plates 28, 29 are arranged on
the other surfaces 22b, 23b of the substrates 22, 23,
respectively.The above-mentioned liquid crystal display device 21,
which is disclosed in the Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication (KOKAI) No. JP-A 61-137132 (1986), prevents a
coloring
