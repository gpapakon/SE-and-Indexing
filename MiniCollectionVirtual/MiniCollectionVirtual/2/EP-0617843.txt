<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF FABRICATING INTEGRATED INFRARED SENSITIVE BOLOMETERSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention disclosed herein relates generally to detectors for detecting thermal radiation and particularly to the class of detectors where the energy of the absorbed radiation raises the temperature of the detecting element and as a result changes the properties of the detector. Bolometers are resistive elements fabricated from a material having a large temperature coefficient so that the absorbed radiation changes the value of electrical resistance.In the past bolometers have typically used infrared sensitive thin film materials which are not normally used in integrated circuits such as permalloy. The use of materials such as permalloy complicates the fabrication of bolometers in that numerous completely independent masks are required for the underlying integrated circuits and for the bolometer element and interconnection.Thus, a need exists for a method of making an integrated infrared sensitive bolometer element from a material that is also typically used in integrated circuits.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention solves these and other needs by providing a method for fabricating an infrared sensitive bolometer. An oxide layer is deposited on an insulating layer over a silicon substrate. The oxide layer is masked and etched to form a remaining oxide region. A first polysilicon layer is deposited and etched at said remaining oxide region to define a location for a bolometer element. A second polysilicon layer is deposited and doped to achieve a predetermined temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) . The second layer of polysilicon is etched to provide openings at the remaining oxide region. 

 The remaining oxide region is etched away with etchant introduced through openings in the second polysilicon layer. The resulting structure is a thin membrane of second polysilicon. This membrane has small thermal conductance so that the thermal time constant is low. The resistance has a high TCR and the responsivity which is inversely proportional to thermal conductivity is high. When the membrane is biased at a given current the absorbed infrared energy will heat the membrane to produce a change of resistance and the resulting signal of the current times the change of resistance is sensed by circuitry in the silicon substrate.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a plot of the temperature coefficient of resistance of several polysilicon samples as a function of the implant dose of arsenic.FIG. 2
