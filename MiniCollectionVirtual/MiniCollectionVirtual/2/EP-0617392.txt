<ABSTRACT>
A measuring system comprises:
 

   an input unit which is adapted for connection to a 
number of sensors for respective quantities for measuring, 

which sensors are each adapted to generate a measurement 
signal representative of the value of the relevant quantity;

 
   a central signal processing unit which is connected to 

this input unit and which comprises marking means for marking 
the measurement signals;

 
   a transmitter which is connected to this central signal 

processing unit and which can transmit radio signals 
containing the marked measurement signals;

 
   a number of portable receivers which can receive these 

radio signals, which receivers each comprise detection means 
which are adapted to detect at least one measurement signal 

with a preselected marking; and
 

   display means connected to these selection means for 
displaying the relevant measurement value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention lies in the field of simultaneous
measurement of a number of variable quantities.The invention has for its object to embody a measuring
system such that a number of users can acquire permanent
insight into measurement values relevant to them, while each
user is nevertheless free to move at a distance from the
object being subjected to measurement. For this purpose the
invention generally provides a measuring system according to claim 1.This system according to the invention makes use of the
basic principle applied in paging systems. The system
according to the invention can transmit measurement values in
wireless manner to a relevant official. The receiver can in
this way be considered a wireless measuring instrument on
which the user can read the information of importance to him
at any desired moment.As is known, paging is a means of communication which
is suitable for transmitting limited amounts of information
directed at a specific user or group of users.
For example, from GB-A-2 219 423 a paging system is known for
receiving data whose value may change periodically. When used as
a
portable measuring instrument there is the danger of the 
paging communication channel becoming overloaded. To prevent
this the invention as defined by claim 1 provides:
a memory for successively storing the values of the
measurement signals; and comparing means for determining the difference
between the current value of a measurement signal
and the associated value stored in the memory and
feeding the relevant difference to the marking
means;
and wherein each receiver comprises:
a memory for storing and feeding to the display means
the most recent value of the second signal. The central
signal processing unit evaluates in this embodiment whether
the provided measurement data differs from the previously
provided information. If this is indeed the case, then only
the difference relative to the preceding measurement value is
transmitted remotely to the receiver. The latter processes
this change and the display means show the new measurement
value.In another embodiment the measuring system comprises a
signal processing unit which is connected between the input
unit and the display unit and which has a memory for storing
a preselected value of a measurement signal;
comparing means for determining the difference between
the current value of this measurement signal and the
associated content of the memory and for generating an alarm
signal when a difference is detected; andreproducing means present in a receiver
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Measuring system comprising:

a first input unit (7) which is connected to a
number of sensors (1-5) for respective quantities for

measuring, which sensors are each adapated to generate a
measurement signal representative of the value of the

relevant quantity,
a first signal processing unit (8) which is
connected to this input unit (7) and which comprises

marking means for marking the measurement signals, a
first memory (12) for successively storing the values of

the measurement signals and first comparing means, such
as an adjusting unit (11), for determining the difference

between the current value of a measurement signal and the
associated value stored in the first memory (12) and

feeding the relevant difference to the marking means,
a transmitter (9) which is connected to this first
signal processing unit (8) and which can transmit radio

signals containing the marked measurement signals,
portable receivers (21), such as pagers, which can
receive these radio signals and which each comprise

detection means detecting at least one measurement signal
with a preselected marking and
display means (19, 20) which are connected to these
detection means for displaying the relevant measurement

value.
Measuring system as claimed in claim 1,
comprising:


a second signal processing unit (15) which is connected
between a second input unit (14) and the display

means (19, 20) and which has a second memory (17) for
storing a preselected value of a measurement signal, 
second comparing means (16) for determining the
difference between the current value of this measurement

signal and the associated content of the second memory
(17) and for generating an alarm signal when a positive

difference is detected and
reproducing means present in the receiver (21) which
are adapted to reproduce this alarm signal.
Measuring system as claimed in claim 1,

wherein the marking means are controlled by the
first comparing means (11).
Measuring system as claimed in claim 2,

wherein the display means comprise two display parts
(19, 20), the first of which (19) displays a measurement

value and the second of which (20) is controlled by the
associated marking and displays an identification of the

relevant sensor (1-5).
