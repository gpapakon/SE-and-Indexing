<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for guiding multiple layers of a liquid down a hopper slide (23) surface are disclosed. The continuous edge guide includes an edger arm (20) extending across the length of the slide surface (23) and having a side facing the slide surface (23). A continuous edge pad (22) is abutted to the contact side which sealingly mates with the slide surface (23). The continuous edge guide is capable of being positioned anywhere across the width of the slide surface. In one embodiment biasing means (31) are positioned along the edger arm to force the edge pad into contact with the slide surface. In an alternate embodiment, the edge pad has a slot at a point above the first or second hopper element to provide good contact between the edge pad and slide surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns coating
multiple layers of material onto a moving substrate.
More specifically, the present invention teaches a
method and apparatus for coating multiple layers of
photographic materials onto a photographic support.In the coating of photographic layers onto a
support such as film base or paper, a number of
individual layers are coated onto the support by means
of a coating hopper. One type of coating hopper is
known as the multiple slide hopper, which is composed
of individual slide elements separated by slots and
cavities. By introducing the individual coating
liquids into separate cavities, the liquids are
distributed to the desired width in a uniform fashion
by flowing through the separate narrow slots. Upon
exiting the slots, the layers flow down the slide
surface by gravity. Layers of different coating
liquids become superimposed on one another as layers
from upstream slots flow over layers from the
downstream slots. It is often advantageous to have
steps between adjacent slide elements. These steps or
slide offsets generally range from 0,127 - 2,54 mm (0.005-0.100 inches).
At the end of the slide surface at a lip, the
superimposed layers of liquid coating flow off of the
slide surface and are coated onto the moving web.In general, the width of the coating layers
can be less than the width of the hopper slide or web
to be coated. It is generally necessary to provide
some means of lateral confinement of the coating
liquids on the hopper slide in order to achieve the
desired width of coating layers on the web. Confining
the liquid layers on the hopper slide is achieved by 
devices known in the art as edge guides. Preferably,
edge guides should be designed such that surface
tension or inertial effects do not create non-uniformities
in the thickness of the layers of the
coating composition in the longitudinal (parallel to
direction of web travel) edge portions. Such non-uniformities
in the coated layers can be a cause of
coated waste or problems in drying the longitudinal
edge portions of the coating as well as problems in
conveying or winding the coated support.The prior art of edge guides is exemplified
by U.S. Patent 3,289,632 (Barstow) and German Patent
3,037,612 Al (Koepke et al). There are several
problems associated with the technology that is
described in these patents. In particular, the edge
guides described by these patents do not comprise a
method for achieving widthwise adjustability of the
edge guides on the hopper surface, which is important
in minimizing

<CLAIMS>
A slide hopper including at least one edge guide and having a
plurality of hopper elements (11) forming a slide surface terminating at a lip

characterized in that it comprises :

at least one edger arm (20) extending along the length of the slide
surface, the edger arm having a contact side facing the slide surface ;
a continuous edge pad (22) abutted to the contact side of the edger arm
and sealingly mating along the length of the slide surface; and
adjustable mounting means (28) for positioning the edger arm across
the width of the slide surface.
The slide hopper according to claim 1, wherein the contact side of
the edger arm facing the slide surface being relieved at a point over the second hopper

element from the lip.
The slide hopper according to any of the preceding claims wherein
the continuous edge pad is sealingly mated with and over the length of the slide

surface, the edge pad having a slot (12) at the first or second hopper element from the
lip and approximately perpendicular to the slide surface.
The slide hopper according to any of the preceding claims further
comprising:


a plurality of biasing means (31) positioned along the edger arm so that
the biasing means exert force on the edge pad.
The slide hopper according to claim 4 wherein each one of the
plurality of biasing means (31) is positioned approximately over the center of one of

the plurality of hopper elements (11).
The slide hopper according to any of claims 4 and 5 wherein the
plurality of biasing means (31) are ball spring plungers (51).
The slide hopper according to any of the preceding claims wherein
the edger arm (20) is relieved to a depth of between about 0.254 mm (0.01 inch) to 

about 2.54 mm (0.10 inch) at a point over the second hopper element (20) from the
lip.
