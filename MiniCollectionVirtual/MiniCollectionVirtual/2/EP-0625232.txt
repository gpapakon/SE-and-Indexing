<ABSTRACT>
A building construction method wherein a vertical framework (7) is erected on a base, supporting members for a vertical concrete cladding (12) are attached to the framework and the cladding is applied to the support by wet spraying the concrete. The method is characterised in that the supporting members are provided as members with a substantially planar supporting surface (33), said members are attached to the framework (7) by means of quick fastening devices (43), and concrete capable of adhering to the supporting surface and flexible enough to prevent cracking is sprayed onto said surface. The method is useful in building construction.
