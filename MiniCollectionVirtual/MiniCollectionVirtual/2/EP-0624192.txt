<DESCRIPTION>
 NOVEL PROTEIN TYROSINE KINASESDescriptionBackground of the InventionTransduction of signals that regulate cell growth and differentiation is regulated in part by phosphorylation of various cellular proteins. Protein tyrosine kinases are enzymes that catalyze this process. Moreover, many act as growth factor receptors.Summary of the Invention The present invention relates to novel protein tyrosine kinase genes present in human megakaryocytic and lymphocytic cells, the proteins encoded by these genes, antibodies specific for the encoded proteins, RNA nucleic acid sequences which hybridize to the genes and methods of use therefor.The genes isolated as described herein are referred to, collectively, as protein tyrosine kinase (pTK) genes. The nucleic acid sequences of these genes, isolated as discussed herein, show significant homology with previously identified protein tyrosine kinases containing extracellular domains which function as growth factor receptors. The pTK genes have been shown to be present in both megakaryocytic and lymphocytic cells.The pTK genes of the present invention show significant sequence homology with members of the c-kit subgroup of growth factor receptors with protein tyrosine kinase activity. The c-kit subgroup of receptor tyrosine kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of exogenous substrates, as well as tyrosine residues within their own polypeptide chains. (Ullrich, A. and Schlessinger, J. , Cell. 61:203 (1990)). Members of the c-kit subgroup include FLT/FLK (Fetal Liver Kinase) , FGF (Fibroblast 

Growth Factor Receptor) and NGF (Nerve Growth Factor Receptor) .In particular, fourteen pTK genes have been identified. Two pTK genes, referred to as SAL-SI and SAL- D4 (also referred to as megakaryocyte derived FGF-like receptor tyrosine kinase) were identified in megakaryocytic cells. Five pTK genes, referred to as LpTKs, were identified in lymphocytic cells and have been shown to be present in megakaryocytes as well. One pTK gene, referred to a HpTKs, was identified in human hepatoma cells. Six pTK genes, referred to as bpTK genes, found in human brain tissue.SAL-SI is related to the FLT/FLK family of pTKs. SAL-D4 is related to the FGF receptor family of pTKs, and one LpTK (LpTK 3) is related to the NGF receptor family of pTKs.The pTK genes, which are the subject of the present invention, were identified using two sets of degenerative oligonucleotide primers: a first set which amplifies all pTK DNA segments (SEQ ID NOS:1-2), and a second set which amplifies highly conserved
