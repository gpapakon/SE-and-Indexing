<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for testing the working accuracy of an NC-machine by comparing a circular set path with a real orbit that describes the actual movement of an NC-machine with at least two axes and at least two axis drives for guiding each a slide according to a position guiding signal which describes the set path of movement, as well as servoregulation circuits having a position sensor for sensing and feeding back the position of the slide. The real orbit RM is derived from the position signals (XM) supplied by the position sensor (33, 43); each position signal (XM) measured by the position sensor (33, 43) is preferably compared with the corresponding position guiding signal (WNC).

Method for testing the operational accuracy of an 
NC machine by comparing a circular desired path (R
NC
) with 
an actual circular path (R
M
), which describes the actual 
machine movement, for an NC machine having at least two 

axes and at least two servo-control circuits (30, 40), 
which each have an axle drive (31, 41) for guiding a 

slide (32, 42) in accordance with the position guidance 
signal (w
NC
) describing the desired movement path (R
NC
), as 
well as a displacement-measuring system (33, 43) for 

detecting and feeding back the position of the slide (31, 
41), the actual circular path (R
M
) being formed from the 
position signals (x
M
) supplied by the displacement-measuring 
system (33, 43), characterized in that the position 

guidance signal (w
NC
) fed to the servo-control circuits 
(30, 40) is subjected to velocity precontrol so that the 

actual position (x
M1
, x
M2
) associated with a desired 
position (x
1
, y
1
) is assumed simultaneously therewith, and 
in that desired and actual position signals each detected 

at the same instant are compared with one another. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the position guidance signal (w
NC
) is additionally 
subjected to acceleration precontrol. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the output signal (x
M
) of the displacement measuring 
system (33, 43) is subtracted from the output signal (w
NC
) 
of the interpolator (10), and the result is subsequently 

subtracted from a reference signal (R
Ref
) and displayed on 
a screen (70). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the output signal (x
M
) of the displacement measuring  
 

system (33, 43) is subtracted from the output signal (w
NC
) 
of the interpolator (10), and the result is subsequently 

added to a reference signal (R
Ref
) and displayed on a 
screen (70). 
Method according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized 
in that the reference signal (R
Ref
) is a circular path 
with a prescribable radius. 
Method for testing the operational accuracy of an 
NC machine by comparing a circular desired path (R
NC
) with 
an actual circular path (R
M
), which describes the actual 
machine movement, for an NC machine having at least two 

axes and at least two servo-control circuits (30, 40), 
which each have an axle drive (31, 41) for guiding a 

slide (32, 42) in accordance with a position guidance 
signal (w
NC
) describing the desired movement path (R
NC
) as 
well as a displacement-measuring system (33, 43) for 

detecting and feeding back the position of the slide (31, 
41), the actual circular path (R
M
) being formed from the 
position signals (X
M
) supplied by the displacement-measuring 
system (33, 43), characterized in that, in a first 

step (21), the values given at the same instance (t
1
) for 
the desired position and for the actual position (x
M
) 
measured by the displacement measuring system are 

detected, and in that, in a second step (22), the desired 
positions determining the actual position are determined 

from these values taking account mathematically of the 
following error.
