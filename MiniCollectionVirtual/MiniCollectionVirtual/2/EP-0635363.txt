<ABSTRACT>
An inking arrangement for printing presses 
comprises an ink fountain member (5) having at least one 

fountain-forming face (7a-7d) for forming an ink fountain, an 
ink fountain roller (1) defining an ink channel (9) together 

with the fountain member and having an outer peripheral 
surface to be inked through the channel, a plurality of 

rollers (2,3) for supplying the ink applied to the peripheral 
surface of the fountain roller (1) to a printing portion, 

and a cleaning tank (11) disposed below the fountain member (5). 
The cleaning tank (1) is provided with a cleaning blade (12) at 

least alternatively shiftable to a cleaning position 
in which the blade is pressed against the peripheral 

surface of the fountain roller (1), or to a stand-by 
position in which the blade (12) is away from the fountain 

roller. The ink applied to the peripheral surface of 
the fountain roller through the channel (9) is scraped off 

by the blade (12) in the cleaning position and collected in 
the tank (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to inking arrangements for printing presses according 
to the preamble of claim 1. A printing press of this kind comprising a fountain member, an ink fountain 
roller defining an ink channel together with the fountain member and a 
cleaning blade in connection with a cleaning tank which blade is alternatively 
shiftable to a cleaning position and a stand-by position as the main elements 
is disclosed by the GB-A 2 262 716. The US-A 5 184 556 discloses a printing apparatus and method having a turret 
forming a plurality of fountain and doctor blade assemblies which are indexably 
mounted adjacent to an ink transfer roll. The changeover of doctor 
blade and fountain assemblies is proposed for saving time when a new printing 
job is started. Cleaning of the doctor blade holder and the doctor blades 
may be postponed until all the doctor blade and fountain assemblies have 
been used. Usual printing presses have an ink fountain 
roller disposed close to an ink fountain member forming 
an ink fountain, from which ink is applied to the outer 
peripheral surface of the fountain roller, then transferred 
by a vibrating roller to an ink distributing 
roller and further supplied to the printing surface 
via a plurality of other ink distributing rollers. The ink fountain member, which is usually in 
the form of a plate, and the fountain roller define an 
ink channel, through which the ink in the fountain is 
applied to the outer peripheral surface of the fountain 
roller. With the printing press described, the kind 
of ink to be used is changed depending on the print to 
be made. In such a case, completion of the preceding 
printing operation is followed by a procedure for 
replacing the ink within the fountain by the one to be 
used for the subsequent printing operation. This 
replacement procedure includes collection of the old  
 
ink from inside the fountain and cleaning of the 
fountain member and the rollers. With the conventional printing press, the 
vibrating roller and the ink distributing rollers are 
automatically cleaned by so-called inker cleaning, 
whereas the fountain roller and the fountain member 
are difficult to clean automatically and are therefore 
cleaned manually in the following manner. After the 
preceding printing operation has been completed, the 
old ink remaining in the fountain is removed by 
manual work with the fountain roller at rest, and the 
portions of the fountain roller and the fountain 
member in contact with the ink are manually cleaned.

<CLAIMS>
An inking arrangement for a printing press comprising an ink fountain 
member (5) having a fountain-forming face (7) for forming an ink fountain, an 

ink fountain roller (1) defining an ink channel (9) together with the fountain 
member and having an outer peripheral surface to be inked through the 

channel (9), a cleaning blade (12) alternatively shiftable to a cleaning position 
in which the cleaning blade is pressed against the peripheral surface of the 

fountain roller (1) or to a stand-by position in which the cleaning blade is 
away from the fountain roller, and a cleaning tank (11) 

disposed below the fountain member, 
the ink applied to the 

peripheral surface of the fountain roller (1) through the channel (9) being 
scraped off by the cleaning blade in the cleaning position and collected in the 

cleaning tank (11), the ink arrangement being 
characterized
 in that a plurality 
of rollers (2,3) is provided for supplying the ink applied to the peripheral 

surface of the fountain roller (1) to a printing portion, and that the fountain 
member (5) is positionable in a plurality of work positions by being rotated 

about an axis of rotation parallel to the fountain roller (1) and has a plurality of 
fountain-forming faces (7a,7b,7c,7d) arranged along the periphery thereof in 

the direction of rotation and each having an ink channel-defining portion (8a, 
8b,8c,8d) at one end thereof, each of the fountain-forming faces (7a,7b,7c, 

7d) forming the ink fountain with its channel-defining portion positioned 
close to the peripheral surface of the fountain roller when the fountain member 

is in the corresponding work position. 
An inking arrangement as defined in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the 
fountain member (5) is approximately in the form of a quadrangular prism 

and has four fountain-forming faces (7a,7b,7c,7d) along its periphery. 
An inking arrangement as defined in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the 
plurality of fountain-forming faces (7a,7b,7c,7d) are different from one another 

in the distance from the axis of rotation of the fountain member (5) to 
the channel-defining portion (8a,8b,8c,8d). 
An Inking arrangement as defined in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the 
positioning angle of the fountain member (5) in each of the work positions is 

finely adjustable.  
 
An inking arrangement as defined in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the 
fountain roller (1) and the fountain member (5) are each at least partly made 

of a magnetic material and which further comprises barrier plates (10) including 
a permanent magnet having a face for magnetically attracting the 

fountain roller (1) in intimate contact with the peripheral surface thereof and 
a face for magnetically attracting the fountain member (5) in intimate contact 

with the fountain-forming face forming the ink fountain. 
An inking arrangement as defined in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the 
cleaning tank (11) is provided with the cleaning blade (12).
