<ABSTRACT>
An output driver is implemented by a complementary 
inverter circuit (23) responsive to an output data signal 

(S1) for selectively charging and discharging an external 
capacitive load (LC), and the complementary inverter 

circuit has a p-channel enhancement type field effect 
transistor (26) formed in an n-type well (33) defined in a 

p-type silicon substrate (21) reversely biased and an n-channel 
enhancement type field effect transistor (27) 

formed in a p-type well (34) nested with a reversely biased 
n-type well (32) defined in the p-type silicon substrate in 

spacing relation to the n-type well assigned to the p-channel 
enhancement type field effect transistor, thereby 

perfectly isolating the p-channel enhancement type field 
effect transistor from a noise propagated from a ground 

voltage line (Lgnd1) to the p-type well assigned to the n-channel 
enhancement type field effect transistor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an integrated circuit 
device and, more particularly, to an integrated circuit 
fabricated on a semiconductor substrate blocking power 
supply lines from a noise. A typical example of the integrated circuit device is 
illustrated in Fig. 1 of the drawings, and is fabricated on 
a lightly doped p-type silicon substrate 1. In this 
instance, two complementary inverter circuits 2 and 3 are 
respectively assigned to separate two pairs of active areas 
4 and 5 defined in a major surface of the silicon substrate 
1. An n-type well 6 is formed in one of the active areas 
4, and a p-type source region 7a, a p-type drain region 7b, 
a gate oxide film 7c and a gate electrode 7d form a p-channel 
enhancement type field effect transistor 7. An n-type 
source region 8a an n-type drain region 8b are formed 
in the lightly doped p-type silicon substrate of the other 
of the active areas 4 in spacing relation, and the n-type 
source region 8a, the n-type drain region 8b, a gate oxide  
 
film 8c and a gate electrode 8d as a whole constitute an n-channel 
enhancement type field effect transistor 8. Two 
input nodes 9a and 9b of the complementary inverter circuit 
2 are respectively connected with the gate electrodes 8d 
and 7d, and an output node 9c is connected with the p-type 
drain region 7b and with the n-type drain region 8b. The 
p-type source region 7a is connected with a positive power 
voltage line Vdd, and a ground voltage line GND is 
connected with the n-type source region 8a. The n-type well 6 further has a heavily doped p-type 
contact region 7e, and a positive power voltage line Vdd 
biases the n-type well 6 through the heavily doped p-type 
contact region 7e. Similarly, a heavily doped n-type 
contact region 8e is formed in the lightly doped p-type 
silicon substrate 1, and the lightly doped p-type silicon 
substrate 1 is grounded through a ground voltage line GND. The p-channel enhancement type field effect 
transistor 7 and the n-channel enhancement type field 
effect transistor 8 are large-sized, and, accordingly, the 
complementary inverter circuit 2 has a large current 
driving capability. For this reason, the complementary 
inverter circuit 2 is usually used as an output driver of 
the integrated circuit, and the output node 9c is connected  
 
with a pad 14 as shown in Fig. 2. In-phase output data signals S1 and S2 are applied to 
the gate electrodes 7d and to the gate electrode 8d, and 
the p-channel enhancement type field effect transistor 7 
and the n-channel
