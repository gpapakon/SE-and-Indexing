<ABSTRACT>
The invention presented relates to a process and composition for the reduction of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides in the effluent from the combustion of a carbonaceous fuel. The composition is a slurry which includes calcium hydroxide effective for the reduction of sulfur oxides in the effluent; a nitrogenous treatment agent effective for the reduction of nitrogen oxides in the effluent; and water. The process permits reductions of sulfur dioxide beyond those found when calcium hydroxide is used alone, without sacrificing nitrogen oxides reductions.

<DESCRIPTION>
 -1-DESCRIPTIONPROCESS AND COMPOSITION FOR NOχ AND SOχ REDUCTIONTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to a novel process and composition for achieving superior reductions in the levels of both nitrogen oxides (NOχ, where x is an integer, generally 1 or 2) , and sulfur oxides (SOχ, where x is an integer, generally 2 or 3) , in the effluent from the combustion of a carbonaceous fuel.When fossil fuels are used in suspension fired boilers, such as large utility boilers, temperatures above about 2000°F and typically above 2200°F are generated. At these temperatures, both nitrogen and sulfur present in the fuels can be oxidized to form acidic combustion gases. Such high temperatures also tend to cause the production of NOχ from nitrogen in the atmosphere, the temperatures being so high that free radicals of oxygen and nitrogen are formed and chemically combine as nitrogen oxides. These pollutants can also form in the effluent streams of other combustors, such as municipal waste combustors and industrial or process boilers or heaters. In fact, any combustion source in which the fuel contains sulfur will yield sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the effluent. 

 -2-Both nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides are troublesome pollutants which are found in the combustion streams of boilers when fired as described above, and comprise major components of acid rain. It is further believed that nitrogen oxides can undergo a process known as photochemical smog formation, through a series of reactions in the presence of some hydrocarbons. They may also impact on the warming of the atmosphere commonly referred to as "the greenhouse effect."What is desired, therefore, is a composition effective for achieving both nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides reductions in a combustion effluent via a single treatment agent introduced in an efficient and practical manner not heretofore seen.Background ArtCompositions and processes for the reduction of NOχ and/or SOχ from combustion effluents have been studied extensively. Due to the increased importance given environmental matters recently, it is expected that such research will continue to be extensively pursued.In the past, several useful processes for achieving nitrogen oxides reductions via selective gas phase reactions have been disclosed. For instance, Lyon, in U.S. Patent 3,900,554 discusses the reduction of NO in a combustion effluent by the use of aqueous solutions of ammonia, optionally with a further reducing agent such as hydrogen, at temperatures which can range up to
