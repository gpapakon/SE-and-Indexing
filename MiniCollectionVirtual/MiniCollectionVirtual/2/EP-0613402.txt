<ABSTRACT>
A centrifuge rotor lid (44) assembly which includes a handle (64) which allows convenient handling of a centrifuge rotor (30) and provides a means of releasing the lid (44) from the rotor (30) after centrifugation. In the described embodiment, the lid (44) is provided with a lid knob (48) and a spindle knob (50) in a coaxial sliding arrangement. The lid knob (48) is used to tighten the lid (44) on the rotor body (30) and the spindle knob (50) is used to tighten the rotor (30) to the centrifuge drive spindle (36). The upper end of the inner knob (50) is provided with a handle (64) which extends perpendicular to the axis of the knob. This handle (64) is used for lifting the rotor (30) after the spindle knob (50) has been unscrewed from the spindle (36) and for unscrewing the lid knob (48). The lower end of the spindle knob (50) has a pin (66) which cooperatively engages the lower end of the lid knob (48) when the spindle knob (50) is lifted from the rotor (30) and is turned in a direction to unscrew the lid knob (48). The handle provides the necessary mechanical advantage for a person to exert sufficient torque to unscrew the lid knob (48) without the use of external tools.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 
centrifugation, and more particularly to centrifuge 
rotors and lids. Fig. 1 shows the sectional view of a prior art 
"fixed angle" centrifuge rotor 10. The rotor has an 
axially symmetric body provided with several cavities 12 
about the rotor axis. Each cavity is sized and shaped to 
receive a centrifuge tube 13 containing the sample to be 
centrifuged. A lid 14 is provided to cover the opening 
15 of the rotor to contain aerosol. A lid knob 16 having 
a threaded end is provided for bolting the lid 14 on the 
rotor 10. A spindle knob 18 having a shaft is provided 
for bolting the rotor 10 to the spindle 20 of a 
centrifuge drive. Several O-ring seals 21-24 are 
provided for sealing adjoining structures as shown. Prior to centrifugation, the rotor is 
positioned on a laboratory bench and centrifuge tubes 13 
containing samples are loaded into the rotor cavities 12. 
Typically, there may be locking and sealing mechanisms 
for each cavity (not shown). The lid 14 is placed to 
cover the rotor opening 15 and the lid knob 16 is hand 
tightened to secure the lid 14 on the rotor 10. The 
rotor is then carried to the centrifuge and lowered onto  
 
the spindle 20. The spindle knob 18 is hand tightened to 
secure the rotor hub against the spindle. For some applications, the rotor may be used in 
a centrifuge which draws a vacuum in the centrifuge 
chamber. In bioresearch applications, one approach to 
centrifugation is to suspend the sample in a cesium 
chloride density gradient forming solution, a technique 
well known in the art. Upon centrifugation, the sample 
components separate into regions or bands parallel to the 
axis of rotation, and at distances from the axis 
depending on their relative densities. When centrifugation has been completed and the 
rotor comes to rest in the centrifuge, air is let into 
the vacuum chamber when the door to the chamber is 
opened. The rotor 10 is lifted from the spindle 20 and 
carried to the laboratory bench where the lid 14 and the 
centrifuge tubes 13 are removed from the rotor cavities. 
The handling of the rotor 10 at the end of centrifugation 
requires special attention. The rotor must be handled 
carefully in a way such that the separated sample 
component bands are not disturbed by vibration. 
Otherwise, mixing of sample components occurs which 
defeats the principle of centrifugation. In the past, 
the rotor is handled by holding the bottom and sides of 
the rotor using both hands of the user. It becomes 
physically demanding on
