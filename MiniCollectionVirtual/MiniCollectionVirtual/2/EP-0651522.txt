<ABSTRACT>
The circuit arrangement according to the invention utilizes 
both outputs of 

an image rejection, whereby one of the desired 
frequency bands is 

obtained from a "signal port" and the other desired frequency 
band from the 

image "signal port". Thus a desired intermediate frequency 
signal band (IF) 

corresponding to the radio frequency input signal (RF) can be 
selected using a 

switch (24), the intermediate frequency signal band (IF) being 
filtered by an 

intermediate frequency filter (20,22). The frequency (LO) of 
the local oscillator is 

selected to be in the middle of the radio bands (RF).

<DESCRIPTION>
Various methods are used in radio communications systems for duplex operations.
Conventional analog systems generally employ Frequency Division Duplex (FDD).
Two different frequency bands are used; one for reception and one for
transmission.Time Division Duplex (TDD) is viable in digital systems. For example, the DECT
system (Digital European Cordless Telecommunications) uses TDD. In this case the
transmitter (Tx) and the receiver (Rx) operate on the same frequency band, only in
different time slots.In some future telecommunications systems such as the UMTS (Universal Mobile
Telecommunication System) the system may have to be able to switch from the
FDD state into the TDD state and vice versa. Two FDD bands would most likely be
used in actual systems, the one upwards (uplink) to the base station and the other
one downwards (downlink) from the base station to a mobile phone, for instance,
and a third frequency band for TDD operations. Thus both the receiver and the
transmitter must switch their operating frequencies when the radio part is coupled
from the FDD state to the TDD state and vice versa. In the intermediate frequency
a different bandwidth is typically used in the FDD state than in the TDD state. This
means that the receiver must also switch the bandwidth of the intermediate
frequency at the same time as the band of the operating frequency is switched.Where the receiver must switch its operating frequency band between two
frequency bands, the changing over can be carried out by switching the frequency
of the local oscillator. At the same time, the passband of the bandpass filter of
radio frequency preceding the mixer should be switched so that it passes the right
frequency band. Alternatively, two bandpass filters can be used, one of which is
respectively coupled to the signal route using two switches. The switching of the 
frequency of the local oscillator can be considerable and it is not easy to
implement using the same synthesizer. On the other hand, using two switchable
synthesizers in the local oscillator is a far more complicated task.The switch of the bandwidth of the intermediate frequency is normally carried
out using two filters and two switches through which the required filter is coupled
to the signal route. Alternatively, filters with different bandwidths can be coupled
in series, as disclosed in US patent 4,385,402.An image reject mixer comprises a 3 dB radio frequency hybrid coupler with a
90 degree phase switch, an inphase power divider of the local oscillators, two
mixers, and
