<ABSTRACT>
An endotracheal tube (10) adapted for aerosol generation at the distal end (14) thereof and which is a modification of existing endotracheal tubes. The improved tube (10) incorporates first (20A) and second (20B) conduits along the length thereof in order to deliver a liquid to be aerosolized and a high velocity gas at the distal end (14) of the endotracheal tube (10) so as to create an aerosol within the lungs. The distal end of the gas conveying catheter (20B) is configured to direct the high velocity gas transported therethrough across the pathway of the liquid solution exciting the distal end of the first conduit (20A) to facilitate the creation of an aerosol for high efficiency delivery of the liquid solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
endotracheal tubes, and more particularly to an
endotracheal tube designed to allow for the generation of
an aerosol at the distal end thereof for direct delivery
to the lungs.Aerosol delivery to the lungs is an important
therapeutic modality in respiratory medicine. Through
aerosols a variety of solutions can be delivered directly
to the lung tissue for various purposes such as to dilate
airways, treat infections and to replace surfactant.
Conventional aerosol generators are of the "jet" variety
wherein a jet of gas is placed over the solution to be
aerosolized and particles of about 1.0-5.0 micrometers are
created. Unfortunately, actual lung delivery of
aerosolized solutions from these devices is quite low. As
is well known to those skilled in the art, even with the
best of technique, standard aerosolization devices
(nebulizers) with appropriate mouthpieces deliver only
about 5.0-20.0% of their material into the lungs, and the
remainder is wasted in the mouth or exhaled back out into 
the environment.The inadequacies of conventional aerosol delivery to
the lungs is made even worse when an endotracheal tube is
placed into a patient's airway and connected to a
mechanical ventilator at the proximal end thereof. Once
this procedure is accomplished, aerosol delivery through
the tube (which is typically about 6.0-10.0 millimeters in
diameter and about 30.0 centimeters long) is reduced to
less than 5% since the tube is narrow and bent and many
times is partially filled with mucus or other respiratory
secretions. All of the circumstances serve as a
significant barrier to aerosol delivery into the lungs
when a patient has been intubated with an endotracheal
tube. Therefore, it is a common practice to substantially
increase the solution dose being applied by a nebulizer to
an endotracheal tube to compensate for the fact that the
endotracheal tube will limit aerosol delivery and
deposition within the lungs. Thus, there is a long-felt
need for a device which will provide for increased aerosol
delivery to mechanically ventilated patients with
endotracheal tubes (intubated patients) since such a
device would provide higher efficacy of aerosol delivery
and would be very cost effective in use.A number of attempts have been made to overcome the
shortcomings inherent in the use of conventional
nebulizers to deliver an aerosol through an endotracheal
tube to the lungs of a mechanically ventilated patient.
The most common approach to the problem is the 
aforementioned increase
