<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a cabin pressure regulation system for aircraft, having a regulator for required/actual comparison of the cabin pressure and a drive, which is dependent thereon, for the air outlet valve, it is provided according to the invention, for simple design and in order to reduce the susceptibility to defects, that the valve (11) has a speed-regulated drive (10) and that feedback to the regulator (7) takes place just via the actual cabin pressure which is newly being set, without any position feedback from the valve (11).

<CLAIMS>
Cabin pressure regulator for aircraft with a controller 
(7, 40, 50) for desired/actual comparison of the cabin 

pressure and an activator, dependent thereon, for an 
air outlet valve (11, 44, 47), characterized in that 

the valve (11; 44, 47) has a speed-controlled drive 
(10; 46, 52; 43, 54) and in that, without position 

feedback from the valve (11; 44, 47), feedback to the 
controller (7; 40, 50) is effected merely by the newly 

adjusted actual cabin pressure. 
Cabin pressure regulator according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the control signals from the 

controller (7; 40, 50) can be transmitted to the drive 
(10; 46, 52; 43, 54) via a digital data bus (8; 41, 45; 

51, 53). 
Cabin pressure regulator according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the digital data bus (8; 41, 45; 

51, 53) is designed according to the Arinc-429 
standard. 
Cabin pressure regulator according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the power supply (21) to the 

drive (11) is switched directly by the control logic 
element (7). 
Cabin pressure regulator according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that information about the current 

status of the drive (10), in particular fault messages, 
results of self tests and limit switch status, is 

combined via a data bus (22, 23, 24). 
Cabin pressure regulator according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that a manually activated driving  

 
motor (30; 55; 56) is provided in addition to the 

controlled drive (10; 46, 52; 43, 54). 
Cabin pressure regulator according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that two controllers (40, 50) with a 

respective control channel and a respective drive are 
provided for the common valve and alternately activate 

and control the drive as a function of external 
parameters. 
Cabin pressure regulator according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that each controller (40, 50) 

cooperates with two respective separate valves (44, 
47).
