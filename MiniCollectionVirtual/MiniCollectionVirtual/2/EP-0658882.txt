<ABSTRACT>
A disk device for moving an arm (2) which supports a head slider (12) and for 
positioning the head slider (12) at a predetermined position of a disk (40), includes a 

suspension (8) fixed at one end to the arm (2); a flexure (10) which is provided in the 
vicinity of the other end of the suspension (8) and on which the head slider (12) is 

mounted; a spherical projection (16) provided to project toward the disk (40) at the end 
beyond the flexure mount position of the suspension (8); a slant base (20) provided with 

a slant surface (24) having an increasing distance from the disk (40) in accordance with 
a radial outward distance of the disk (40) ; and a drive source (36) for moving the 

arm (2) so that the projection (16) is moved in engagement with the slant surface (24) in 
loading and unloading.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disk device for
moving an arm which supports a head and for positioning the
head in a desired position.Now, a CSS (Contact Start Stop) system is applied to
a generally used magnetic hard disk device. In this system,
when a magnetic hard disk is stopped, a magnetic head is in
contact with a disk surface, and the magnetic head is
lifted in accordance with the rotation of the disk.USP 4,933,785 discloses an N-CSS (Non-Contact Start
Stop) type magnetic hard disk device. In the device, a cam
follower member is provided inside a head slider on a
surface, on a disk side, of a head support suspension of a
rotary actuator assembly (i.e., on an actuator coil side),
and a cam surface assembly is provided in the vicinity of
an outer peripheral portion of the disk. During the
unloading, the rotary actuator assembly is moved outside
the disk and the cam follower member is brought into
contact with the cam surface. Thereafter, the rotary
actuator assembly is moved along the cam surface and is
held stationary in a lock position. Also, USP 5,027,241 discloses an N-CSS type magnetic
hard disk device. In this device, a cylindrical loading tab
is provided at a tip end of a head supporting suspension of
a rotary actuator assembly, and a loading slant structure
is provided in the vicinity of an outer peripheral portion
of the disk. During the unloading, the rotary actuator
assembly is moved to outside of the loading slant structure
and the loading tab is brought into contact with the
slanted surface of the loading slant structure. Thereafter,
the rotary actuator assembly is moved along the slant
surface and is held stationary in a parking region.The Japanese Mechanical Association (No. 900-52)
Lecture Paper (1990, August 23 and 24, Tokyo,
Mechatronics), 204, entitled "The Load/Unload Dynamics for
In-line Type Flying Head Systems in Magnetic Disk Storage"
shows measurement examples relating to the contact/non-contact
in an N-CSS system. In the measurement examples,
however, the load/unload operation of the slider is carried
out by an arm which carries a suspension. This system is
different from that of the present invention. Also, the
paper shows the measurement examples in which it was
measured whether or not the slider was brought into contact
with the disk surface at a loading speed of 80mm/s and
40mm/s and at an unloading speed of 5mm/s. However, the
paper is silent with respect to the preferable numerical 
range. With respect to the posture of the slider, the paper
describes that it is

<CLAIMS>
A disk device for moving an arm (2) which supports a head slider (12) and for
positioning said head slider (12) at a predetermined position of a disk (40), comprising:


a suspension (8) fixed at one end to said arm (2);
a flexure (10) which is provided in the vicinity of the other end of said
suspension (8) and on which said head slider (12) is mounted;
a slant base (20) provided with a slant surface (24) having an increasing distance
from said disk (40) in accordance with a radial outward distance of said disk (40);

characterized by
a spherical projection (16) by the formation of a dimple provided to project

toward said disk (40) at the end beyond the flexure mount position of said
suspension (8); and

   a drive means (36) for moving said arm (2) so that said projection (16) is moved
in a sliding point contact with said slant surface (24) in loading and unloading operation.
The disk device according to claim 1, wherein said projection is formed on a
projection (16) carrying plate (14) which is discrete from said suspension (8), said

projection carrying plate (14) being fixed to said suspension (8).
The disk device according to claim 1, wherein said projection (16) is formed
integrally with said suspension (8).
The disk device according to claim 3, wherein said suspension (8) has flanges
(9) at its periphery, and a flat region, provided with no flanges, between said flexure

(10) and said spherical projection (16).
The suspension (8) according to one of the claims 1 to 4, wherein an angle for
the head slider mount surface of said flexure region is selected so that a spaced distance of a

leading end (LE) of said head slider (12) relative to said disk (40) is longer than a
spaced distance of a trailing end (TE) of said head slider (12) relative to said disk (40).
The suspension (8) according to claim 5, wherein the angle for said head slider
mount surface of said flexure region is approximately 0.3 degrees.
