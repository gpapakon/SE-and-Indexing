<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of human
Interferon-β for the preparation of pharmaceutical
compositions for treating chronic myeolid leukemia (CML).All peripheral blood cells arise from a common progenitor cell known as
the pluripotent hemopoietic stem cell. An important property of stem
cells is self-renewal, which ensures a continuous supply throughout the
lifetime of the individual. When required, a pluripotent cell can begin
to differentiate, and with successive divisions it loses the capacity
for self-renewal, and its progeny becomes committed to a particular line
of development. These progenitors will then give rise to all the blood
cells capable of functional purposes.The formation of mature blood cells comes at the end of a process which
comprises the proliferation and maturation of specifically commited
progenitor cells from each lineage. Pluripotent cells are thus capable
of producing a clone consisting of a number of red cells, granulocytes,
platelets and lymphocytes, together with their intermediate progenitor
cells. Under normal circumstances, the marrow is able to respond quickly to an
increased demand for a particular type of cell. How it does so is the
subject of much current research. It is known that the process of
proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells is under the
control of several growth stimulants known as hematopoietic hormones,
e.g. erythropoietin and several colony-stimulating factors.Erythropoiesis consists of a process that begins at the stage of early
BFU-E (burst-forming unit - erythroid, the earliest red cell precursor)
formation, mainly governed by interleukin-3 (IL-3) and subsequently
further maturation to CFU-E (colony-forming unit - erythroid) and
normoblasts by erythropoietin. Normoblasts mature to reticulocytes and
then to erythrocytes, the mature blood cells.It is known that there may be differences in the age of circulating and
bone marrow progenitor cells. The effects of all three types of
interferons - alpha, beta and gamma, have been studied by several groups
on normal bone marrow progenitor cells. It was found that all three
interferons exert a suppressive effect on growth of colony-forming cells
from normal bone marrow (Broxmeyer, Hal E. et al. (1983) Comparative
analysis of the influences of human gamma, alpha and beta interferons on
human multipotential (CFU-GEMM), erythroid (BFU-E) and granulocyte-macrophage
(CFU-GM) progenitor cells, J. Immunol. 131:1300-1305). Thus,
they have been implicated in the suppression of in vitro colony
