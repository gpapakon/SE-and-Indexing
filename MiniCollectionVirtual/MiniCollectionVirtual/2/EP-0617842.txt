 THERMAL TRANSFER POSTS FOR HIGH DENSITY MULTICHIP SUBSTRATES AND FORMATION METHODField of the InventionThe present invention relates to methods for forming thermal transfer posts fo conducting heat between an integrated circuit chip mounted on and connected to a high densit interconnect substrate.Background of the InventionMulti-layer thin film high density interconnect structures for interconnectin integrated circuit chips provide many apparent advantages to the electrical circuit designer. Th high density interconnects provide very tight packaging of the circuit chips with shorte external conductor paths and resultant improvements in signal path speeds. However, a interconnect path densities increase at the substrate, difficulties arise in conducting hea generated within the integrated circuit chip during its operation to the substrate (or to a meta plane formed on the substrate) from which it may then be carried away or dissipated by a hea sink, etc.High density interconnects are multi-layer, very fine feature printed circui boards which are typically fabricated by using techniques employed in the manufacture of the integrated circuit chips themselves. In one typical arrangement, the interconnect structure wil include a substrate of thin film ceramic, crystalline silicon, or metal upon which multiple layers of thin film conductors are formed. The conductors within a particular layer, and the conductors from layer to layer, are separated by a polymer dielectric, such as polyimide. A continuous ground plane layer of metal is typically deposited onto a planarized thin fil substrate.Following formation of the metal ground plane layer, alternating layers o polymer dielectric and thin film metal conductors are laid down (typically forming e.g. x- dimension signal plane layer, y-dimension signal plane layer, power plane layer and top metal layer). The metal conductors are conventionally patterned with photolithographic techniques including applying a metal plane, and then applying, patterning and developing a photoresist in order to pattern the metal plane. One increasingly popular form of high density interconnect structure is known as a multichip module. A multichip module is one form of hybrid circuit and comprises 

 single substrate to which two or more integrated circuit chips are mounted and interconnected. In order to minimize the size of the module, it is desirable to mount the circuit chips on top o the multilayered support substrate in a manner wherein at least some of the signal and powe paths
