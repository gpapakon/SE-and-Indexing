<ABSTRACT>
A lamp-within-a-lamp headlamp unit includes an inner 
lamp body (102) which is adjustably received within a first 

end of an outer lamp housing (104). A second end of the 
outer lamp housing defines a lens (104F) through which light 

is projected from the headlamp unit. The inner lamp 
body (102) sealably receives a lamp bulb (108) through a 

bulb access opening in a first end of the lamp body (102) 
which is accessed through the first end of the outer 

housing ((104). Light is projected from the second 
end (102b) of the lamp body (102) which can be open if 

appropriate focusing reflectors are provided adjacent the 
lamp bulb (108) or closed by an internal lens. An area 

surrounding the second end (102b) of the lamp body (102) is 
sealed to the outer lamp housing (104) by a flexible inner 

seal (102) which extends between the lamp body and an inner 
portion of the outer lamp housing. The flexible inner 

seal (106) permits the inner lamp body (102) to be adjusted 
relative to the outer lamp housing (104) which is secured to 

a motor vehicle for aligning or aiming the light beam 
projected from the headlamp unit. At the same time, the 

flexible inner seal (106) is sufficiently resilient so as to 
provide shock adsorbing support for the inner lamp body. 

The inner sealed headlamp permits alignment or aiming 
devices for the headlamp to be open to the atmosphere. A 

one-way vent (136) may be installed in the outer lens of the 
outer lamp housing (104) or a lens extension which extends 

between the outer lens (104F) and the first end of the outer 
lens housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to headlamps
for a motor vehicle and, more particularly, to an improved
lamp-within-a-lamp headlamp design having an inner seal
between an inner lamp body and an outer headlamp housing.Headlamps for motor vehicles have evolved from sealed
beam systems wherein self-contained headlamp units each
include one or two filaments, a reflector and a lens, all of
which are formed into a glass shell with terminals extending
out the back of the unit for electrical connections to the
filament or filaments. Such sealed headlamp units are
mounted into support frames which are adjusted typically
from the front of the vehicle to properly align or aim the
light beams projected from the vehicle.To simplify headlight installation in a vehicle,
adjustment of headlamp alignment and replacement of burned-out
headlamp filaments, headlamp units have been designed
which are adjustably supported within a vehicle for
receiving a headlamp bulb, typically a halogen bulb, from
the rear of the unit. Such improved headlamp units
eliminate substantial amounts of waste when headlamp
filaments burn out and must be replaced. Headlamp alignment
or aiming is simplified and typically performed from the
rear of the headlamp unit. Exemplary headlamp units of this
form are disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 4,471,413 and No.
4,569,007.Another form of improved headlamp unit is disclosed,
for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,574,334. This form of
headlamp unit includes a lamp-within-a-lamp, i.e. a
reflector which supports a bulb is adjustably supported
within a lamp housing.
The known headlamp comprises an access opening for inserting a
headlamp bulb within the housing, and horizontal lamp body orientation
adjustment means accessible from a rear end of the housing. 
As is apparent from this patent, the
inner lamp or reflector is supported near the ends of
adjustment screws, pivot members and the like such that it
is subject to being deflected due to forces produced as the
vehicle including the headlamp unit is driven. Further, the
lamp housing is sealed such that dirt and moisture cannot
accumulate on the lens which is on the front of the 
reflector. Since the lamp housing is sealed, all alignment
adjusters must also be sealed where they enter the housing or
else the housing seal will be compromised. The added complexity
required by sealing the alignment adjusters is also apparent
from a review of this patent.A headlamp unit as set forth in the preamble of claim 1
is disclosed in US-A 3 018 364. One headlamp unit

<CLAIMS>
A headlamp unit for a motor vehicle comprising:

a lamp body (102) defining an inner cavity for receiving
and supporting a headlamp bulb (108) in a first end (102a) of

said inner cavity and projecting light generated by said bulb
from a second end (102b) of said inner cavity opposite to said

first end (102a);
a housing (104) having an interior for adjustably
receiving said lamp body (102) in a first end (104R) thereof

and defining a lens (104F) in the second end thereof opposite
to said first end such that light projected from said lamp body

(102) is projected through said lens (104F); and
flexible inner seal means (106) extending between said
second end (102b) of said lamp body (102) and said housing

(104) for sealing to said inner cavity of said lamp body a
portion of the interior of said housing (104) extending from

said lens (104F) approximately to said lamp body (102),
