An orthodontic aid, in particular a bracket or buccal tube, 
produced on a plastics basis, comprising a reinforcement 

increasing the mechanical strength and being arranged at 
least in areas acted upon by tooth correcting forces, 

characterized in that the reinforcement is produced with the 
use of a ceramic material. 
Orthodontic aid as defined in claim 1, characterized in that 
the ceramic material is an oxide ceramic material. 
Orthodontic aid as defined in claim 2, characterized in that 
the reinforcement comprises a ceramic part, in particular 

made of sintered polycrystalline alumina. 
Orthodontic aid as defined in claim 3, characterized in that 
the ceramic part is held in a force fit in the aid. 
Orthodontic aid, as defined in claim 3, characterized in that 
the ceramic part is spray-coated with plastic. 
Orthodontic aid as defined in claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the reinforcement is a polymer part filled to a 

considerable extent with particulate ceramic material.  
 
Orthodontic aid as defined in claim 6, characterized in that 
the aid and the reinforcement are designed in one piece. 
Orthodontic aid as defined in any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the reinforcement is designed and 

arranged such that it essentially forms the surface regions 
of the aid, via which the correction forces are transferred 

to the aid. 
Orthodontic aid as defined in any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the reinforcement is produced from a 

translucent material. 
Orthodontic aid as defined in any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the plastic comprises a polycarbonate, 

polyethylene, polyester or polyacrylic resin portion or 
copolymer portions derived therefrom. 
Orthodontic aid as defined in any of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the particulate ceramic material 

comprises zirconia, silicon dioxide, in particular as 
powdered quartz or cristobalite, or alumina, in particular 

in the form of the trihydrate. 
Orthodontic aid as defined in claim 11, characterized in 
that the average particle size of the ceramic material is 

approximately 5 µm to 100 µm. 
Orthodontic aid as defined in any of claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the aid is a bracket comprising a base 

for direct bonding of the aid to a tooth surface and that 
the reinforcement is designed such that the mechanical 

strength of the base is essentially not influenced.  
 
Orthodontic aid as defined in claim 13, characterized in 
that the reinforcement is present only in the region of the 

slot provided for accommodating an arch wire. 
Orthodontic aid in the form of a bracket, produced from a 
plastic filled to a considerable extent with particulate 

ceramic material.
