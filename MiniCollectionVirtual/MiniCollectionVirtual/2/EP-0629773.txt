<ABSTRACT>
In a diagnostic method for motor vehicles, having a diagnostic device for testing electronically controlled systems, in which a fault memory which is provided in an electronic control device is interrogated and in which test steps which are to be carried out are prescribed in accordance with the information of the fault memory, the test steps which are carried out in response to the prescribed test steps are detected.

<CLAIMS>
A method of diagnosis for motor vehicles comprising a diagnostic device for 
checking electronically controlled systems, wherein a fault memory provided in an 

electronic control device is interrogated and wherein required test steps are preset 
and the test steps carried out in response to the preset test steps are at least partly 

detected, characterised in that the detected test steps are compared with a 
selection of the required test steps and a report is displayed and/or stored if a 

required test step is not included in the detected test steps. 
A method of diagnosis for motor vehicles comprising a diagnostic device for 
checking electronically controlled systems, wherein a fault memory provided in an 

electronic control device is interrogated and wherein required test steps are preset 
and the test steps carried out in response to the preset test steps are at least partly 

detected, characterised in that the detected test steps are recorded in the 
sequence in which they occur, the detected test steps are compared with a 

selection of the required test steps, and a report is displayed and/or stored if the 
detected test steps differ in their sequence from a preset sequence in which the 

test steps are to be carried out. 
A method of diagnosis according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
test steps carried out and detected and/or the report are stored in non-volatile 

manner in the control device under test.
