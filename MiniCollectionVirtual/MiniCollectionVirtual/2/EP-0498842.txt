<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dithered angular rate 
sensor according to the preamble of claim 1 in 
which a dithering bias is used to minimize the effects 
of lock-in inherent in such sensors. More 
particularly, this invention relates to a 
mechanization for removing the dither signal from the 
sensor rotation output signal. The behavior of ring laser angular rate 
sensors, usually referred to as ring laser gyros, is 
well understood. Inherent in such sensors is the 
phenomena known as lock-in in which 
counter-propagating laser beams tend to lock together 
to a common frequency. The lock-in phenomena causes 
performance errors which have deleterious effects in 
navigational systems. To avoid or reduce the effects of lock-in, 
the ring laser gyro may be biased by an alternating 
bias technique such as that shown and described in  
 
U.S. Pat. No. 3,373,650. The alternating bias technique is 
usually referred to as dithering, and may be 
implemented by a variety of ways including 
electro-optical and mechanical schemes. Since 
dithering, by either of these mentioned techniques and 
the like, directly affects the behavior of the 
counter-propagating laser beams, the sensor readout 
signal will contain not only inertial rate 
information, but will also contain a signal component 
directly related to the dithering (alternating bias) 
of the sensor. In situations where the gyro is mounted to an 
inertial platform or mounting base, and mechanical 
dithering is applied, the gyro output will consist of 
the sum of the base angular motion and the gyro 
dither motion relative to the mounting base. This is 
true whether the sensor readout is mounted directly on 
the sensor (laser block mounted) or fixed relative to 
the sensor mounting base (case mounted) like that 
shown in the aforementioned patent. The signal contribution in the sensor readout 
signal due to the alternating bias is herein referred 
to as the dither signal component. For low noise 
navigational systems, the dither signal component in  
 
the readout signal generally needs to be minimized or 
removed to avoid control problems, particularly in 
block mounted readout systems. Prior art solutions to remove the dither 
signal component include, among others, notch 
filters. However, such notch filters generate gain 
and phase shift disturbances which can affect the 
stability of any control loops or any readout signal 
processing systems. Another solution utilizes a 
digital pulse subtraction technique as taught in U.S.
