<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for transmitting a digital television signal using a 
single QAM (quadrature amplitude modulated) carrier which provides audio and video 

data packets at respective complex symbol data rate levels. One purpose of the 
invention is to provide a digital television signal which resembles the audio vs. video 

reception characteristics exhibited by conventional analog television (i.e. NTSC). way 
communication path.

<DESCRIPTION>
The Federal Communications Commission and cable television testing 
organizations such as Cable Labs, have been evaluating digital television delivery 
systems in order to choose a new television "standard" which someday will replace 
NTSC in the United States. These systems all involve digital coding and data 
compression techniques, for example those utilizing the MPEG algorithm or variations 
thereof. Such systems utilize other digital compression schemes, for example 
MUSICAM, to digitally code audio. MPEG is discussed in U.S. serial No. 774,006, 
filed October 8, 1991 which is incorporated by reference herein. Several systems, such as those demonstrated by the Advanced Television 
Research Consortium and the American Television Alliance, propose using quadrature 
amplitude modulation (QAM) in the transmission of the coded television information. 
QAM has demonstrated robust performance during the tests conducted by the ATTC 
(Advanced Television Testing Committee). Conventional analog broadcasts (i.e. NTSC) provide the audio portion of 
the television signal as a frequency modulated signal while using amplitude modulation 
for the video signal. One desirable feature of NTSC is that a relatively clear audio 
signal can be received even when the video signal is marginally viewable. Certain digital television systems, for example the DIGICIPHER system 
proposed by the American Television Alliance, utilize a single quadrature amplitude 
modulated carrier to provide both video data and audio data. An undesirable 
characteristic of such single carrier systems however, is that there is no gradual roll off 
in signal reception as with NTSC. Instead reception tends to abruptly "cut off" once 
the receiver-to-transmitter distance reaches the point where error correction and 
concealment processes cannot accurately compensate for the increased BER (bit error 
rate) and reduced C/N (carrier to noise). One goal of another of the proposed digital television systems is to 
provide a transmitted television signal which imitates the gradual reduction in overall 
reception quality provided by conventional television signals. Toward this end, the  
 
Advanced Television Research Consortium has proposed quadrature amplitude 
modulating two separate carriers with separate data streams having different priority 
levels. One data stream provides video and audio information necessary to receive a 
"basic" television signal, and is transmitted on a first QAM carrier having the more 
robust transmission characteristic. A
