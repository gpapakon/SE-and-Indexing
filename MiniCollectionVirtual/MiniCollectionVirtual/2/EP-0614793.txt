<ABSTRACT>
A railway vehicle has a frame which is suspended on wheelsets (10) each 
having a live axle (11). The ends of the axles (11) are mounted in 

axleboxes (12). Couplings (17 to 21) are provided which are attached to 
the vehicle frame (13) and which couple an axlebox (12) of one wheelset 

to an axlebox (12) of another wheelset. The couplings are such as to 
constrain relative movements between the wheelsets (10) in a lateral 

plane. In addition, each coupling includes a crank lever (19) which 
operates to uncouple lateral movements of the frame (13) from the 

movements of the wheelsets (10), thereby providing shear stiffness to the 
vehicle and reducing vehicle hunting at speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS invention relates to railway vehicle suspensions.It is known that the wheelsets of railway vehicles which have live axles
and wheels with conical or profiled treads are prone to excite oscillations
of the vehicle in the lateral plane and such oscillations, often referred
to as hunting, become unstable beyond a certain critical speed. For safe
operation it is essential that this critical hunting speed is higher than the
maximum operating speed of the vehicle and as operating speeds of
trains have been steadily increasing in recent years novel railway vehicle
suspensions are required to cope with this hunting problem.An analysis of the hunting phenomenon shows that for the simplest
railway vehicle or railway bogie which has two wheelsets the critical
hunting speed decreases with increasing mass of the wheelsets and
increases with increasing stiffness of the suspension elements which
constrain the relative motions in the lateral plane of the two wheelsets,
namely the yawing motions of the two wheelsets in an equal and an
opposite sense of rotation and the relative lateral motions of the two
wheelsets. Conventionally the wheelset suspension consists of axle box springs and
wheelset guidance elements which are elastic in the lateral and
longitudinal directions. In this case the constraint to yawing motions of
the two wheelsets in an equal sense of rotation and the constraint to
relative lateral motions of the wheelsets (often referred to as shear
stiffness) is generated by the combined in series elastic effect of the
lateral and longitudinal stiffness of the elements which suspend the
wheelsets to the bogie frame. The constraint to yawing motions of the
two wheelsets in an opposite sense of rotation (often referred to as
bending stiffness) is generated by the longitudinal stiffness of the
elements which suspend the wheelsets to the bogie frame. Thus increases
in shear and bending stiffness which, as mentioned above, will increase
the critical speed of hunting, can be obtained by increasing the lateral
and longitudinal stiffness of the elements which suspend the two
wheelsets to the bogie frame. However, experience has shown that there
is a limit to this as an increase in the stiffness of the wheelset suspension
elements also causes the lateral and yaw oscillations of the bogie frame
and the wheelsets to be strongly coupled dynamically and this has a
de-stabilising effect on the vehicle.In order to avoid this de-stabilising coupling effect between the bogie
frame and wheelset oscillations it has been

cause the crank lever (70) to rotate in the second direction, thereby to reduce
the tension in the strap (80) and cause a consequential reduction in the

constraint to relative yawing motion between the coupled wheelsets.
