<ABSTRACT>
A syringe (5) used in DSA (Digital Subtraction Angiography) and PTCA 
(Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angiography) is provided with a 

syringe drive unit driven by a motor (61). The motor velocity is 
controlled by a manual controlled variable voltage (71). A time sequence 

of the variable voltage which has given a successful control is stored 
in a memory. When a similar syringe control is requested, the stored 

data is read out from the memory to produce a control voltage of the 
motor (61).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a syringe control system for 
DSA(Digital Subtraction Angiography) and PTCA(Percutaneous 
Transluminal Coronary Angiography). Diagnosis by DSA and medical treatment by PTCA have become 
popularized in these years. Throughout these medical operations of 
DSA and PTCA, the operated portion is observed by an X-ray monitor 
television display. In order to obtain a clear view of the operated 
portion on the display, contrast medium must be injected in blood 
vessels in the operated portion. And syringe manipulation for 
injecting the contrast medium has been a burden to the operator. In one example of PTCA, a guide catheter holding a balloon 
catheter within, is first inserted into the lumen of the coronary 
artery, and subsequently, a guide wire going through the through 
lumen of the balloon catheter is pushed through a target coronary 
artery. A balloon which is formed at an end of the balloon catheter 
is pushed along the guide wire to be placed in the stenosed coronary 
artery lumen. The balloon is then inflated to expand the stenosed 
portion. Throughout these operations of pushing the guide wire and the 
balloon catheter, contrast medium must be injected in the lumen, 
and since the contrast medium is dispersed in a short time, the 
injection must be so repeated that a clear display is obtained for 
each observation. For the injection of contrast medium, a syringe is pushed little 
by little by manually adjusting the push amount to inject contrast  
 
medium through the aperture between the guide catheter and the 
balloon catheter. The manipulation of pushing the syringe for contrast medium 
injection requires a very fine adjustment, and the pressure 
injection of the contrast medium requires a relatively large force 
for a hand-exerted force. Moreover, a similar manipulation must be 
repeated over and over again. Thus, the syringe manipulation has been a burden which gives the 
operator an extreme tension and exhaustion. And, the operator is exposed to a fairly large amount of 
radioactivity, as the operator must remain close by the patient. Therefore, an object of this invention is to provide a 
power-drive for a syringe, in which the drive unit is controlled 
through a hand-control or a foot-control. An electric circuit 
translates a fairly large displacement in the hand- or foot-control 
to a very fine displacement of the syringe piston. And, since the 
syringe piston is displaced by a motor of the syringe drive unit, 
the high pressure exerted on the syringe
