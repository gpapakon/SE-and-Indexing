<ABSTRACT>
A negative mask suitable for use in 
photographic printer. The negative mask, which has 

windows through which printing light passes, and 
which is used to cover a negative film (16), is 

characterized in that mask members (118, 122) used 
for covering the negative film (16) and each having 

the window through which the printing light passes 
and which is defined in a portion corresponding to 

each of image frames on the negative film (16), and 
cut-away portions (130, 132) each of which is formed 

in at least one side of the window so as to enlarge 
the window and through which portions of the negative 

film (16), which extend out from each image frame,

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a negative
mask for a photographic printer, which is used when
images on a negative film are printed/exposed onto a
photosensitive material and which is applied even to,
for example, a printer-processor which is a
combination of a photographic printer and a
processor. In particular, the present invention relates to a photographic printer in accordance with
the preamble of claim 1.A photographic printer of the aforementioned type is disclosed in JP-4-003045A. A printer-processor is a so-called "mini-laboratory"
and is used in a developing, printing and
enlargement (DPE) shop or the like. In the printer-processor,
a printer unit, which prints/exposes
images recorded on a negative film onto photographic
paper, and a processor unit, which effects
development processing of the printed and exposed
photographic paper, are combined into a single unit.
By simply setting an elongated photographic paper at
the printer-processor, the photographic paper can be
automatically conveyed to the printer unit and the
processor unit and processed thereat.Namely, in the printer unit of the printer-processor,
the images recorded on the negative film 
are enlarged to selected predetermined sizes and are
printed on photographic paper. The photographic
paper on which the images of the negative film have
been printed is continuously conveyed to the
processor unit where the negative film is subjected
to developing processing so that the images are
finished as photographic prints.When such a negative film is processed, in
addition to normal size image frames (hereinafter
called "full size image frames"), panorama-size image
frames, which have been used in recent years, exist
on the negative film. A panorama-size image frame is
a rectangular image surface which is narrower than a
full-size image frame.However, the conventional printer-processor
has not been able to judge, on at least a negative
mask for a panorama size, whether the size of the
image frame is full size or panorama size.
Therefore, first, an operator counts, from the
leading image frame of the negative film, the image
frames to determine the number of the image frame at
which there is a panorama size image, and then the
negative film is loaded into the printer-processor.
The panorama-size image frame is first skipped over
and only the full-size image frames are printed and
subjected to exposure. Thereafter, the negative mask
for full size is replaced with the negative mask for 
panorama size, which has a window smaller (narrower)
than

<CLAIMS>
A photographic printer, which has a negative mask for masking a
negative film (16), said negative mask having windows for passing

printing light, wherein

said negative mask includes a mask member (122) for masking the
negative film (16), and said mask member (122) has a said window

comprising a first portion corresponding to an image frame on the
negative film (16), and cut-away portions (130) defined in at

least one side of said first portion, whereby portions of the negative
film (16), which extend out from each image frame, are visually

confirmable through said window,
characterized in that
said negative mask includes a set of
substantially superimposed

mask members (118, 122) for
masking the negative film (16), each mask member having a said

window for passing printing light,
each of said windows comprises a first portion corresponding to an
image frame on the negative film (16), and cut-away portions (130,

132) defined in at least one side of said first portion, whereby
portions of the negative film (16), which extend out from each

image frame, are visually confirmable through said windows, and 
a light-shading member for blocking printing light, which escapes

from said cut-away portions (130, 132), is provided in the path of
light between a density measuring unit (56) and said negative

mask.
A
photographic printer

according to claim 1,
wherein said mask member (122) has a light-shading

member (140) which is provided so as to cover said
cut-away portions (130, 132) at positions where the

printing light transmitted through said cut-away
portions (130, 132) is blocked and which is formed in

such a manner that said cut-away portions (130, 132)
are confirmable from a diagonal direction.
A
photographic printer

according to claim 1, 
wherein said mask members (118, 122) respectively

have rectangular-shaped windows, each of said cut-away
