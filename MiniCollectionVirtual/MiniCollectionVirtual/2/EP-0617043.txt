<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein are a platinum compound employed as raw material of 
medicines having carcinostatic effects, and a process of preparing the 

platinum compound. The platinum compound (I) substantially free from 
impurities can be prepared through a reaction between the corresponding 

dihalogen compound and an organic dibasic acid employing an iodine compound 
utilizing the difference of solubilities between the desired compound and 

the iodine compounds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a platinum compound and a process of
preparing the same.Heretofore, compounds according to formulas
(I) and (II) below have been known as platinum compounds
having carcinostatic effects. DE-A-0 376 076 and GB-A-2 024 823
disclose the use of platinum complexes for
the treatment of cancer.
The compound (I) has been obtained by means of
the following procedures. At first,
according to the processes described
in US-A-4,169,846 and EP-A-376 076,
the compound (II) is prepared by reacting
K2Pt(II)X4 (X is Cl or Br) with a 1,2-cyclohexanediamine isomer. A silver
nitrate solution of two equivalents in respect to the compound (II) is added
to a solution prepared by dissolving the compound (II) into water under
boiling to precipitate chlorine or bromine as silver chloride or silver
bromide which is then filtered off. To the filtrate is added an organic
dibasic acid to obtain the desired compound (I).
However, this preparation process possesses a disadvantage that many
impurities such as the unreacted compound (II), compounds (III) and (IV) which
are by-products of the compound (II) and an unreacted silver ion remain in the
compound (I) prepared according to the above process.One of the reasons the impurities are contaminated in the desired
compound (I) is the low solubility of the compound (II) in water. For example,
when the compound (II) is a chloride of a trans-1-isomer, its considerably low
solubility in water is about 0.26 mg/ml and even if dissolved under boiling,
only about 0.5 mg/ml of the compound (II) dissolves. Because of the low
solubility of the compound (II), it is quite difficult to completely
dechlorinate the compound (II) from the viewpoint of its characteristics
resulting in the contamination of the above impurities.A remarkable problem also remains in the removal of the silver chloride
formed as a result of the above reaction. The solubility of the silver
chloride is relatively low so that almost all the silver chloride formed can
be removed in ordinary conditions. However, in the above reaction, a large
amount of water is required due to the low solubility of the compound (II) so
that the complete removal of the silver chloride may be impossible in such a
reaction employing a large amount of water.This tendency becomes worse when the bromide is employed.Many platinum compounds may possess physiologic activities such as
cytotoxity, and the contamination of the above unreacted compound (II) and the
by-products (III) and (IV) is not allowed in the raw material for

<CLAIMS>
A process of preparing a cis-platinum (II) complex of a
1,2-cyclohexanediamine isomer designated by a general formula (I)



(in the formula, the conformation of 1,2-cyclohexanediamine is cis, trans-d or
trans-1-isomer, and R
1
 and R
2
 form with each other a circular group selected
from the group consisting of the formulae (V), (VI), (VII), (VIII), (IX) and

(X))


which comprises adding to a dihalogen compound of a cis-platinum (II) complex
of a 1,2-cyclohexanediamine isomer designated by a general formula (II) a

silver ion solution containing not less than two equivalents of silver in
respect to the compound (II), removing silver chloride and/or silver bromide,

adding to the solution sodium iodide and/or potassium iodide to convert the
unreacted compound (II), the by-products of the compound (II) and an unreacted 

silver ion to their iodine compounds followed by the removal theroof and
thereafter adding an organic dibasic acid to the remaining platinum complex.
