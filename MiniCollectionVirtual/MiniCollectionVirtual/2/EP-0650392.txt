<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for cleansing air of its mercury vapour content includes a filter (14) having a very large surface against which mercury vapour molecules can impinge during their passage through the filter. The filter surface includes one or more precious metals, for instance platinum or gold, which are highly resistant to oxidation and to formation of other chemical compounds, such as sulfides. The arrangement may be included in dental drilling equipment, with the exit side of the filter (14) connected to a suction pump (15) typically found in dental drilling equipment, or may be included in a face mask (20) which is intented to be worn over the nose and mouth of the dentist when performing dental work, the mask being constructed so that air inhaled by the dentist is caused to pass through the filter (24). Alternatively, the arrangement may be included in air-purifying apparatus intended for a dental clinic and provided with one or more filters (34) through which air contaminated with mercury vapour and taken from one or more treatment rooms in the clinic is cleansed. The invention also relates to a method of cleansing mercury-vapour contaminated air at approximately room temperature with the aid of the air-purifying arrangement, and also to the use of the purifying arrangement at approximately room temperature for cleansing air from its mercury vapour content.

<DESCRIPTION>
AN ARRANGEMENT EOR REMOVING MERCURY VAPOUR FROM AIR.The present invention relates to an arrangement for cleansing air of its mercury vapour content in accord¬ ance with the preamble of Claim 1. The invention also relates to a method according to the preamble of claim 7 and to the use of the arrangement according to the preamble of Claim 8.There is a great general need to cleanse contaminated air of its contaminant content in different localities and also in outdoor environment. In the case of the car industry, this need has forced the development of engine exhaust purifying techniques by means of which much cleaner engine exhaust gases are obtained. These exhaust gas purifiers extract gases other than mercury fumes and are not normally effective until tempera- tures in excess of 250°C are reached.Methods for cleansing air of its mercury vapour con¬ tent are known to the art. According to one known method, air that contains mercury vapour is passed through a container which includes a seleniferous material in the form of small "stones". This container is both large and expensive to provide.According to another known method, mercury-containing air is passed through a honeycomb system of very thin, folded or pleated gold sheets.As far as is known, these methods have not been used in practice in conjunction with dental work, which constitutes an important application of the present invention. This is probably because of the very high costs entailed. 

In dental treatment, a tubular suction device is often used to remove the debris and particles formed when drilling an amalgam filling, and also the water which is used to cool the drill and which collects when drilling. There are indications which show increas¬ ingly that amalgam fillings and the treatment of such fillings can have a serious toxic effect on human beings and result, among other things, in headaches, giddiness and extreme tiredness. Consequently, the desire to extract effectively mercury vapours and amalgam dust by means of suction has grown progres¬ sively in recent times.Although advances have been made with regard to suck- ing away mercury fumes and amalgam dust during dental treatment, significant quantities of mercury vapour still escape into the surroundings of the dental room or surgery when treating amalgam fillings. Another source of mercury vapour in a dental surgery resides in the amalgam dust and the amalgam particles that are liable to collect in the surgery/dental clinic in conjunction with dental treatment. There is therefore a

Claims
1. An arrangement for cleansing air of its mercury vapour content, comprising a filter having a large surface against which the molecules of the mercury vapour can strike during their passage through tne filter, said surface containing a precious metal, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i that the filter includes a known catalyst body developed for the purification of vehicle exhaust gases and comprising a large number of passageways, where in the catalyst body is intended to work at normal room temperature and wherein the sur¬ face containing said precious metal is comprised of the combined surfaces of all said passageways.
2. An arrangement according to Claim 1, c h a ¬ r a c t e r i z e d in that the channel walls of the catalyst body are coated with a coating substance conventional in vehicle exhaust catalysts containing platinum and a further precious metal, preferably rhodium, in the approximate weight ratio of 5:1.
3. An arrangement according to Claim 1, c h a ¬ r a c t e r i z e d in that the passageways of the catalyst body are coated with gold.
4. An arrangement according to any one of Claims 1-3, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the arrangement is included in dental drilling equipment with the input side of the filter (14) connected to a suction source (10) for removal of particles, dust and vapour from the oral cavity of a patient, via apparatus for remov¬ ing water, dust and particles, and in that the output side of the filter is connected to the suction pump conventionally included in dental equipment.
5. An arrangement according to any one of Claims 1-3, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the arrangement is included in a face mask (20) which is intended to be 


worn over the nose and mouth of the dentist while performing treatment on the teeth of a patient, and in that the mask is constructed so as to cause the air inhaled by the dentist to pass through the filter (24).
6. An arrangement according to any one of Claims 1-3, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the arrangement is included in air-purifying apparatus intended for use in a dental clinic and is provided with one or more filters (34) into which air contaminated with mercury vapours is drawn from one or more treatment rooms of the dental clinic and cleansed in said filter(s) .
7. A method for cleansing air of its mercury vapour content, c h a r a c t e r i z e d by passing air contaminated with mercury vapour through a purifying arrangement according to any one of Claims 1-6 at least roughly at room temperature.
8. The use of a purifying arrangement according to any one of Claims 1-6 for cleansing air of its mercury vapour content at at least roughly room temperature.
