<ABSTRACT>
A Satellite News Gathering system, communicates between the TV studio 
and a mobile ground station, using an existing broadcast link through an 

existing TV transmitter for transmitting the TV studio sound to the 
mobile groundstation. The mobile groundstation uses a satellite link to 

transmit to the TV studio. 
In order to remove the reporters voice signal from the broadcast 
signal, which returns from the TV studio through the TV transmitter, as 

an echo signal, the reporters voice signal is delayed at the mobile 
ground station, and subtracted from the broadcast signal being received 

from the TV transmitter.

<DESCRIPTION>
A monitor receiving system and a monitor receiving 
device The present invention relates to a monitor receiving 
system and a monitor receiving device for a signal 
communication between a key station and a local place 
through a repeater station using a communications satellite 
line and a broadcasting line between the key station and 
the repeater station, and an art offering a monitor voice 
to make a reporter in a local place easy to talk. As being made a broadcasting technic to use a 
communications satellite fit for practical use as shown the 
outline in Fig.1, the present television broadcasting 
technic is used actively to broadcast many kinds of 
programs in each broadcasting company with use of the 
communications satellite. There are many methods of 
practical use for using the Satellite News Gathering 
(hereinunder called "SNG" in shortened expression). As an 
suitable example among them, a morning program "Zoom in 
Asa" broadcasted by Nippon Television Network Corporation 
can be introduced. The style of the program is a so-called 
"Kakeai(dialog)", in which the key station A and the 
repeater station B are connected with a SNG line as shown 
in Fig.1, a caster in the key station makes various kinds  
 
of questions and a reporter at the local place C in the 
repeater station B answers the questions. In the case of sending a speech signal sent to the 
key station A from the local place C through the 
repeater station B and the communications satellite line 
to the local place C through the television broadcasting 
line and the repeater station B and receiving the signal 
at the local place C, however, the reporter listens 
delayed his/her own voice as an echo and is very 
difficult to talk because the speach signal of the 
reporter in the local place C is delayed about 250ms 
while coming to the studio in the key station A through 
the repeater station B and the communications satellite 
line, the delayed signal is mixed with a speech signal 
added in the key station A and turned a television 
signal, the reporter in the local place C receives the 
television signal through the repeater station B. For avoiding the above problem, conventionally, so-called 
"N-1" system, that is a receiving system sending 
back a speech signal taken away the voice of the 
reporter in the local place from the mixed program 
speech signal in the key station A with a telephone line 
or other specially provided speech line to let the 
reporter in the local place C monitor the voice, is 
adopted. However, there is
