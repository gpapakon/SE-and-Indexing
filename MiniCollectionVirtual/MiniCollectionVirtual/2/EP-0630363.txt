<DESCRIPTION>
 RECOVERY OF ACETYL VALUES FROM ETHYLIDENE DIACETATEThis invention pertains to a process for the recovery of acetyl values from ethylidene diacetate (EDA) wherein EDA is subjected to an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis under boiling conditions to produce a vapor stream comprising acetaldehyde and acetic acid. The vapor stream is then catalytically oxidized to produce an acetic acid vapor stream.The preparation of acetic anhydride by contacting a mixture comprising methyl iodide and methyl acetate and/or dimethyl ether with carbon monoxide in the presence of a rhodium catalyst has been reported extensively in the patent literature. See, for example, U.S. Patents 3,927,078, 4,046,807, 4,374,070 and 4,559,183 and European Patents 8396 and 87,870. It is known, e.g., from U.S. Patent 4,374,070, that the inclusion of a minor amount of hydrogen in the carbon monoxide feed gas results in the formation of EDA.Although the amount of EDA formed per unit of acetic anhydride is low, the amount of EDA produced in a multi- million kilogram per year acetic anhydride plant is substantial. The crude or partially—refined product obtained from such acetic anhydride processes typically comprises a mixture of acetic anhydride, acetic acid and EDA as a result of the use of acetic acid as a process solvent anάVor the co—production of acetic acid by including methanol and/or water in the feed to the carbonylation reactor.EDA is a useful chemical intermediate for the production of vinyl acetate, e.g., according to the process described in British Patent 2,013,184. However, 

 the volume of EDA produced as a by—product in large acetic anhydride production systems is not sufficient for the investment required to purify the EDA and convert it to vinyl acetate. Thus, the EDA fraction of the crude product of acetic anhydride processes must be disposed, for example, by incineration.We have developed a process whereby EDA may be converted to valuable acetyl values by first hydrolyzing the EDA under boiling conditions to produce a vapor stream comprising acetaldehyde and acetic acid and then catalytically oxidizing the vapor stream to produce an a second vapor stream comprising acetic acid and water. Our invention therefore comprises the steps of:(1) feeding ethylidene diacetate and water to a liquid phase, hydrolysis zone containing a non—volatile, acidic catalyst and maintained under boiling conditions;(2) removing from the hydrolysis zone a vapor comprising acetaldehyde, acetic acid and water; (3) feeding the acetaldehyde, acetic acid and
