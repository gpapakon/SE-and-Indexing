<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an alkyl Grignard reagents in diethylene glycol 
dibutyl ether. The invention also relates to a novel method for preparing Grignard 

reagents comprising reacting an alkyl halide with magnesium metal in the presence 
of diethylene glycol dibutyl ether. Grignard reagents prepared in the presence of 

diethylene glycol dibutyl ether have improved yields and stability, including storage 
stability, at room temperature. The Grignard reagents are prepared without the use 

of a low boiling and/or flammable stabilizing agents such as benzene, toluene, 
tetrahydrofuran, and diethyl ether.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing Grignard reagents in the
diethylene glycol butyl ether and methods of making the same.Grignard reagents are prepared by the reaction of magnesium metal with an
organic halide. Grignard reagents have been prepared in the presence of ether
solvents and tetrahydrofuran. It is known that the preparation of Grignard reagents
are often quite difficult. Formation of these reagents is inhibited by the presence of
water and alcohols, ethers and halides and by impurities on the surface of the
magnesium turnings.U.S. Patent 2,552,676 relates to a method of manufacturing organometallic
compounds. This process involves reacting organic halides with magnesium in the
presence of glycol ethers. Alkyl Grignard reagents are described prepared from
ethylene glycol diethyl ether, diethylene glycol diethyl ether, and tetraethylene glycol
dimethyl ether. Aryl Grignard reagents are described which are prepared from
ethylene glycol diethyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol n-butyl
ethyl ether, diethylene glycol n-butyl ethyl ether, diethylene glycol diethyl ether,
ethylene glycol, dibutyl ether, and tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether.U.S. Patent 2,838,508 relates to a chemical process involving separating
Grignard reagents from saturated or ethylenically unsaturated cyclic ethers. The
process involves mixing a Grignard reagent, which is in the presence of
tetrahydrofuran, with ethylene glycol or polyethylene glycol. The ethylene glycol or
polyethylene glycol separates the tetrahydrofuran from the Grignard reagent and
allows removal of tetrahydrofuran.U.S. Patent 3,758,620 relates to a process for preparing Grignard reagents.
The process involves treating solvent systems such as ether solvents, diethyl ether,
tetrahydrofuran, dibutyl ether and 1,2 dimethoxyethane with reducing halides. The
addition of the halide reduces and or eliminates the induction period which occur
in most preparations of Grignard reagents. It is desirable to have a solvent which may be used in the preparation
of the Grignard reagent and not form precipitate upon cooling of the Grignard
reaction. Further, it is desirable to have high boiling solvents used in the
preparation of Grignard reagents.We have now devised a method of preparing Grignard reagents
which overcomes or reduces the problems associated with the prior art.The invention relates to a method of preparing Grignard reagents
comprising reacting an organic halide, preferably an alkyl halide, with magnesium
metal in the
