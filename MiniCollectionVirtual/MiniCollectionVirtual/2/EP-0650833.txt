<ABSTRACT>
Squeegee assembly, in particular intended for 
coating an substantially cylindrical object, such as metal, 

seamless screen printing cylinders, with a liquid or pasty 
material, at least comprising two substantially annular 

squeegees (5, 6) arranged at a distance from each other, 
between which squeegees (5, 6) material metering means open 

out for metering a material to be applied to the object 
(13) to be coated; which squeegees (5, 6) can form part of 

a wall which is resilient, at least in places, of an 
annular squeegee pressure chamber (3), which is provided 

with pressure fluid supply means (4), while an annular 
material-supply chamber (10) may be present in the squeegee 

pressure chamber (3) which is provided with openings (90) 
which open out between the squeegees (5, 6), and also 

comprises a material supply (11) which can be connected to 
a material source.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a squeegee 
assembly, in particular intended for coating a 
substantially cylindrical object, such as metal, seamless 
screen printing cylinders, with a liquid or pasty material, 
at least comprising two substantially annular squeegees 
arranged at a distance from each other. Such a squeegee assembly is known from the prior 
art and is frequently used in a coating device or also 
manually in order to provide substantially cylindrical 
objects with a coating of material. Such a squeegee 
assembly is used, for example, for coating a seamless metal 
rotary screen printing cylinder, which is, for example, a 
nickel cylinder having a wall thickness of between 50-500 
microns and comprising 20-200 holes per running cm, with a 
lacquer. After such a screen printing cylinder has been 
coated, that is to say the lacquer coating on the dams 
between the holes has a specific layer thickness and a 
suitable depth of penetration into the holes, said lacquer 
coating is removed in accordance with the pattern, while 
the remaining areas are hardened. Such a screen printing 
cylinder is then ready for screen printing, in which case a 
dye is pressed on a substrate to be printed through the 
open holes by means of an internal squeegee, as known from 
the prior art. The coating of cylindrical objects with the aid of 
the known squeegee assembly has a number of important 
disadvantages. Firstly, the displacement of such a squeegee 
along the cylindrical object has to be carried out in a 
very accurate manner, as differences in layer thickness and 
penetration depth of the material to be applied occur in 
the case of even the smallest eccentricity between the 
squeegee and the object. Furthermore, the choice of the 
shape of the squeegee and its rigidity, as well as the 
choice of the lacquer are relatively complicated and 
dependent on many factors. The layer thickness and 
penetration depth of the material to be applied to, for 
example, a screen printing cylinder are dependent on the 
rigidity of the squeegee, the speed of displacement of the  
 
squeegee and the properties of the lacquer, such as 
viscosity, solids content, surface tension, etc. Finally, 
supplying the material to be applied to the object to the 
squeegee assembly is an operation which is difficult to 
regulate and is carried out manually, so that it requires a 
skilful operator. In most cases, an excess amount of 
material is supplied between the squeegees, which causes 
substantial problems when it is removed after
