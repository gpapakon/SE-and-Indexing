<ABSTRACT>
A nonwoven fabric having a good processability in heat welding and suitable as the material of interlinings 
or cushions, and a binder fiber to be used for producing the fabric. The fiber is one made from an ε-caprolactone 

copolyester fiber having a melting point of 100 °C or above. The fabric comprises matrix fibers bonded to each 
other with the binder fibers by point bonding. The fabric is soft to the touch and excellent in the resistance to fatigue 

deformation when used for long or in a high-temperature atmosphere.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a conjugate binder fiber and a
nonwoven fabric using the fiber. Nonwoven fabrics using such a
fiber are suitable for use especially as cushion material
because they are so soft in hand that, even after prolonged use
or when used in a high temperature atomosphere, they are
unlikely to flatten and not liable to any appreciable decrease
in their adhesion strength.Hitherto, various known types of nonwoven fabrics in which
principal fibers are bonded with binder fibers have been used
in applications such as filters, interlinings, shoulder
paddings, furniture stuffings such as sofa cushion, chair back
cushion, and other cushion paddings, and cushion material for
beds and automotive seats.A binder fiber of the type which has hitherto been largely
used has its binder component comprised of polyester copolymer
including ethylene terephthalate and ethylene isophthalate.
This polyester has high rigidity and is a non-crystalline
polymer which does not exhibit any definite crystalline melting
point but begins to soften at temperatures above the glass
transition point (about 65 to 70°C ). Known nonwoven fabrics
which are manufactured by subjecting a combination of the
principal fiber and the binder fiber to the process of heat 
nonwoven fabric which incorporates the novel binder fiber so
that it has soft feel, is unlikely to flatten when used in a
high temperature atmosphere, and has good heat bondability.The present inventors reviewed possibilities of developing
such a novel binder fiber and a nonwoven fabric incorporating
the same and this led to the present invention.Accordingly, the present invention provides a conjugate binder fiber having a
first component comprising a polyester copolymer with which ε-caprolactone is
copolymerized and a second component comprising a polyethylene terephthalate, said
conjugate binder fiber is one selected from the group comprising a sheath-core with said
first component constituting the sheath and said second component constituting the core,
a side-by-side consisting of said first and second components, a sea-island with said first
component constituting the sea and said second component constituting the island and a
split fiber consisting of said first and second components, and said first component has a
melting point of not less than 100°C.The invention also provides a nonwoven fabric wherein a
principal fiber is bonded by a binder fiber,
said binder fiber is a conjugate binder fiber, said conjugate binder
fiber has a first component comprising
