<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an anchoring system employing a harpoon fixed under a helicopter and a grid (2) mounted in a platform. A harpoon head according to the invention consists of a spindle (1) including, near its end, fingers (5) which are oriented and movable radially between a retracted position and an extended position. The spindle (1) includes means for driving the fingers (5) and retaining them in extended position, these means acting from an armed state in response to penetration into the grid (2). It additionally includes means for unlocking the fingers (5) and rearming the drive and retaining means. The invention also relates to harpoons provided with such heads, which have the advantage of being light and simple, and thus adaptable to all types of helicopters.

A harpoon catching head in an anchoring system using a harpoon and a 
grid (2), and used for securing a vertical take-off and landing aircraft, including a 

shaft (1) having fingers (5) oriented and movable radially, means for moving and 
retaining the fingers (5) in the extented position, said means acting from a state 

activated in response to the penetration of the shaft (1) into a cell of the grid (2), 
after which the fingers (5) are brought under the level of the smallest diameter of 

said cell, and means for locking the fingers (5) and resetting said moving and 
retaining means, harpoon head characterised in that,
 
   the shaft is cylindrical with a convex end,
 
   the finger are near said end and are oriented and movable radially according 

to perpendicular axes with respect to axe of the shaft, between a retracted position 
inside the shaft and an extented position,
 
moving and retaining means consisting of a rod (6) mounted so that it is capable of 

sliding into an axial bore (3) in the shaft, into which open the radial holes (4) in which
 
   the fingers (5) are engaged, the rod cooperating via its conical lower end (6a) 

with the inner ends (5b), which are also conical,
 
   and locking and resetting means consisting of a trigger system including the 

rod (6), which is located above the fingers (5) and a sensitive to the passage into a 
cell of the grid (2). 
A harpoon head according to claim 1, characterised in that the fingers (5) are 
three in number, with an angular offset of 120°. 
A harpoon head according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the shaft (1) 
has a collar or peripheral shoulder (23) to limit its penetration into the grid (2). 
A harpoon head according to claim 3, characterised in that one of the 
descending or rising movements of the rod (6) in the bore (3) is provided by a 

spring (8). 
A harpoon head according to claim 4, characterised in that the rod (6) is 
returned towards the bottom by the spring (8), the return to the top position being 

obtained by traction on a pull cable (10) of which it is an integral part. 
A harpoon head according to claim 4, characterised in that the other 
movement of the rod (6) is provided by pneumatic means.  

 
A harpoon cooperating with a grid (2) in a securing system for vertical take-off 
and landing aircraft, characterised in that it comprises a catching head according to 

one of claims 1 to 6. 
A harpoon according to claim 7, comprising a catching head according to 
claim 6, characterised in that its arm is constitued by a jack (24), and in that the head 

or shaft (1) is located at the end of the rod (28) of the jack (24). 
A harpoon according to claim 8, characterised in that, in the shaft (1), the 
ascent of the rod (6) in the bore (3) is mechanical and its descent is pneumatic, the 

rod (6) being integral with a piston (20) movable in a bore (21), the upper 
chamber (21a) of which communicates with the upper chamber (24a) of the 

jack (24), the extension of the jack (24) and the catching in the grid being controlled 
by pressurisation of the chamber (24a) and, as a consequence, of the 

chamber (21a), and the releasing and the retraction of the harpoon being controlled 
by releasing of the pressure, the spring (8) thereby ensuring the raising of the rod (6) 

into the bore (3), and a spring (31) ensuring the raising of the piston (29) into the 
jack (24). 
A harpoon according to claim 8, characterised in that, in the shaft (1), the 
descent of the rod (6) in the bore (3) is mechanical and its raising is pneumatic, the 

rod (6) being integral with a piston (20) movable in a bore (21), the lower 
chamber (21b) of which communicates with a compressed air source via a flexible 

tube (32). 
A harpoon according to claim 10, characterised in that the jack (24) is 

extented by a spring (31), and is retracted by pressurisation of its lower 
chamber (24b), the retracted state being maintained by means of a lock (33). 
A harpoon according to claim 10, characterised in that the jack (24) is 
extented by pressurisation of the upper chamber (24a), and is retracted by the action 

of a spring (31). 
A harpoon according to one of claims 8 to 12, characterised in that, in the 
catching position, it is tensioned by pressurisation of the lower chamber (24b) of the 

jack (24).
