<ABSTRACT>
A dielectric filter (11) includes a couple of transverse
electric (TE)10-mode resonators (1a, 1b) connected in

series. Each resonator (1a, 1b) is such that a conductor
(3a, 3b) is formed on one substantially entire surface of a

dielectric body (6a, 6b). On the connection surfaces of the
resonators (1a, 1b) are formed grooves (2a, 2b),

respectively. On the inner round surface of the grooves
(2a, 2b), excluding the portions of central gaps (21a, 21b),

there are formed conductors (3a, 3b). Connecting the couple
of resonators (1a, 1b) combines the grooves (2a, 2b) to form

a coupling-adjustment hole (2) having an axis parallel to
the interface between the resonators (1a, 1b). The gaps

(21a, 21b) combine to form a coupling window (21). The
coupling window (21) is exposed in the coupling-adjustment

hole (2), which electromagnetically couples the couple of
resonators (1a, 1b).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to dielectric filters
and dielectric duplexers, and in particular, to a
dielectric filter and a dielectric duplexer used in a
microwave or milliwave-band communication apparatus or the
like.As shown in Fig. 14, there is a known conventional
dielectric filter 30 formed by connecting in series
transverse electric (TE)10-mode dielectric resonators 31a
and 31b in which conductors 33a and 33b are formed on
substantially entire surfaces of rectangular parallelepiped
dielectric bodies 36a and 36b. On the connection surfaces
of the resonators 31a and 31b, excluding the portions of
rectangular coupling windows 32a and 32b, the conductors
33a and 33b are respectively formed. Connecting the
resonators 31a and 31b causes the coupling windows 32a and
32b to correspond to each other, and the resonators 31a and
31b are inductively or capacitively coupled via the
coupling windows 32a and 32b. In this arrangement, the
connection surfaces of the resonators 31a and 31b have no
portions exposed from surfaces of the dielectric filter 30.
At ends of the resonators 31a and 31b are formed
input/output electrodes 34a and 34b so as not be conductive
to the conductors 33a and 33b. The resonators 31a and 31b
are also provided with external coupling holes 35a and 35b.
The central frequency of the dielectric filter 30 is
determined by dimensions in the length direction (x
direction denoted by an arrow in Fig. 12) and the width
direction (y direction denoted by an arrow in Fig. 12) of
the resonators 31a and 31b. In addition, characteristics
(the electromagnetic coupling amount, pass-band width, etc.
between the resonators 31a and 31b) of the dielectric
filter 30 are determined by the sizes of the coupling 
windows 32a and 32b and so forth.In general, when characteristic of a dielectric
filter are adjusted, characteristics such as a pass-band
width are measured, with a plurality of resonators
connected to one another, and the adjustment is performed
by changing the sizes of the coupling windows 32a and 32b
and so forth in accordance with the measured results.
However, according to the conventional dielectric filter
30, when the resonators 31a and 31b are connected to each
other, the coupling windows 32a and 32b cannot be exposed
from surfaces of the dielectric filter 30. Accordingly, by
disengaging the connection between the resonators 31a and
31b so that they are separate, the connection surfaces of
the resonators 31a and 31b on which the coupling windows
32a and 32b are formed must be exposed. In
