<ABSTRACT>
A process incorporating chlorine dioxide precursors into a polymer 
or oligomer film that is coated onto various substrates. Controlled release 

is accomplished by absorption of moisture from the environment. An 
amine (primary, secondary, 
or tertiary amines substituted with 2-hydroxy or 
2-carboxyamido ethylene groups) is dissolved or suspended into a melt 

consisting of monomers capable of strong hydrogen bonding. An apolar 
phase containing a water hydrolyzable acid anhydride or silane terminated 

acid is then blended with the polar amine containing phase to produce a 
two phase system of arbitrary degree of dispersion. Reacting dry chlorine 

dioxide or chlorine dioxide solutions in apolar solvents with the oligomer or 
polymer film produces an iminium chlorite salt. The chlorine dioxide is 

released when the iminium chlorite loaded polymer is hydrated by ambient 
moisture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a composition for reducing
bacterial and fungal growth and repelling insects, and more particularly to
an ionomeric composition having a biocidal or insect repelling releasing
agent and method for making same.Chlorine dioxide ("ClO2") is a well known bleach, disinfectant,
fumigant and deodorizer [W. J. Masschelin and Rip G. Rice, "Chlorine
Dioxide, Chemistry and Environmental Impact of Oxychlorine Compounds",
Ann Arbor Science, Ann Arbor, Mich.] The biocidal uses of chlorine
dioxide in packaging alone is a market of several hundred million dollars
a year. Especially sought after are coatings which can release chlorine
dioxide at surface concentrations of parts per million ppm over several
months. ClO2 has been incorporated in polymer [JP 63,296,758, NOK Corp,
1988; CA 111 P120181s] and ceramic beads [JP 63,274,434, Enkler
Busin.K.K., 1988; CA 111 P11975h], and in a calcium silicate wrapped in
non-woven cloth [JP 57,168,977, Enkler Busin.K.K., 1982; CA 98 P77552]
to be used as a deodorant. Food preservation is an application where a gel
form is preferred JP-A-57022102, Diamaru Kogyo Kaishi, Ltd., 1982; CA 97
22409].Chlorine dioxide generating gels have also been used as topical
applications for disinfection [A.J. Kenyon, S.G. Hamilton and D.M.
Douglas, Am.J.Vet.Res., 45(5), 1101 (1986)]. Typically the preparation
involves mixing component A (gel with suspended NaClO2) with component
B (gel with lactic acid) immediately prior to use. α-hydroxy carboxylic acids
(citric, tartaric, malic, glycolic) are especially useful for generating ClO2 by
the reaction:
H+ + NaClO2 → HClO2 + Na+
5HClO2 → 4ClO2 + HCl + 2H2O
[Ger.Offen. 2,817,942, H.Allinger, 1979; WO-A-88/08823, J. Mason,
1988, CA 110 P98205h]. Alternatively, NaClO2 and lactic acid have been
separately encapsulated in polyvinyl alcohol and then mixed with water to
generate ClO2 [Can. 959,238, Chemical Generators, 1974]. Formulations
involving sulfonic acids are also available [Europ. Pat. Appl. EP 287,074,
Alcide Corp., 1987; CA 111 P45299f].Food packaging with the incorporated disinfectant, chlorine dioxide,
brings up an important public health question pertinent to this practice:
Does chronic ingestion of residual levels of disinfectants result in a
significant genetic or carcinogenetic hazard to the human population? It is 
apparent from published pharmacokinetic studies aided by incorporation of
a chlorine radioisotope (36Cl) that skin patch (Alcide gel) administration of
chlorine dioxide and chlorite result
