<ABSTRACT>
This material includes a homogeneous matrix (1) of ceramic substance, for example of boron carbide B4C or of BN, in which are dispersed clusters which are calibrated or otherwise (3), for example pseudospherical ones from 100 to 500  mu m, consisting of refractory metals such as Mo, molybdenum boride and/or B4C. Mechanical properties which are improved when compared to those of pure B4C are obtained by virtue of the presence of these clusters.
