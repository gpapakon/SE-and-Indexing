<ABSTRACT>
A process for cracking polymers is proposed, in which the polymers used are cracked by the action of ultrasonics and the cracked products are converted in a directly following reaction to the compounds which can be isolated as the end products of the process. In this reaction, catalytic hydrogenation, saponification or hydrolysis, ammonolysis and alcoholysis are preferentially used.

Process for the cleavage of polymers, in particular
for the recycling of plastics materials, characterized in

that, in a first process step, the polymers are
introduced into a reactor which contains at least one

liquid phase and in that, in a second process step, the
polymers are broken up with ultrasound in the liquid

phase and the reactive polymer fragments thus obtained
are converted, in an immediately subsequent reaction,

with a coreactant already present in the reactor at the
time of the production of the polymer fragments, into

compounds which can be isolated as final products of the
process and whose reactivity is so low that they do not

enter into any crosslinking reactions under the process
conditions.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the reactive polymer fragments are catalytically

hydrogenated immediately after their production.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in that
the catalyst used for the hydrogenation is introduced

into the reactor before the second process step in the
form of a Raney alloy of aluminium and/or silicon

containing at least one metal from the group comprising
nickel, cobalt, iron, copper or molybdenum.
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in that
alkali hydroxides or oxides and/or alkaline-earth

hydroxides or oxides or an aqueous solution of said
compounds is introduced into the reactor before the

second process step.
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in that
the second process step is performed immediately after

adding the alkali compound or its aqueous solution so 
that the activation of the catalyst is accelerated by the

exposure to ultrasound and the hydrogen produced in this
process participates, at least partially, in the

hydrogenation of the polymer fragments.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
a dispersion of a Raney alloy composed of aluminium

and/or silicon containing at least one metal from the
group comprising nickel, cobalt, iron, copper or

molybdenum in an alkaline aqueous solution is introduced

performed.
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in that
the second process step is pe
rformed immediately after
the addition of the alkaline dispersion of the Raney

alloy so that the activation of the catalyst is
accelerated and the hydrogen produced in this process

participates, at least partially, in the hydrogenation of
the molecule fragments.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
an already activated Raney catalyst is introduced into

the reactor before the second process step.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
a hydrogenation catalyst which has already been used in

other processes and has reduced activity is introduced
into the reactor before the second process step.
Process according to one of Claims 5 to 9,
