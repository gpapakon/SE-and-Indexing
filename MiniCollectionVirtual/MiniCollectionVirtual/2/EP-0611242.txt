<ABSTRACT>
A system for the monitoring and detection of heat sources 
in open areas comprising an integrated assembly of 

observatories which include autonomous means (2) of 
infrared vision (11) and diurnal vision (12) and which 

are linked to a central control station (1) where the 
images are processed in real time for the automatic 

detection of heat sources, in particular fires, within a 
certain area of coverage. The system can be applied to 

the automatic detection of forest fires in areas of 
several square kilometres.

<DESCRIPTION>
One of the main problems associated with the fight against forest fires is
the delay before any action is taken, due in part to the lack of automatic
mechanisms which can provide early detection.Current procedures for the detection of forest fires are, in most cases,
based on the use of human means for monitoring zones in which fire is a potential
danger and only in rare cases on systems based on directional sensors which can
raise the alarm if the level of radiation exceeds a predetermined limit. These
systems suffer from a number of drawbacks, for example:
They are unable to process a given observation zone in parallel and in real
time.They are unable to identify and classify the heat sources.The information generated by the sensor is low quality, above all in terms
of spatial resolution. The information refresh frequency is low.It is impossible to display the information coming from the sensor to an
operator as a real time image on a screen.As a result of the above the detection efficiency of these systems is
reduced in terms of speed or response and the probability of the occurence
of false alarms.European Patent Application 117162 describes a heat source detection system which
is based on an infrared sensor element which makes a circular scan step by step.
The occurence of a heat source is detected by sending the information coming
from the sensor to a remote station where, for each point, the intensity of the 
signal from the sensor is compared with that which was recorded during the
previous scan, generating an alarm if a certain limit is exceeded.The need to displace the sensor mechanically and step by step over each
point of the zone being monitored. together with the unidimensional nature of the
sensor itself, means that the system is slow, low in resolution and liable to create
false alarms.PCT W091/09390 describes a fire fighting system based on
observatories which are also provided with infrared sensors with the addition of
diurnal cameras. Fires are detected at the observatory itself which is therefore
more complex and as such less reliable than if carried out at a remote control
station. The drawbacks associated with using infrared sensors instead of infrared
vision cameras are the same as those described with reference to the patent
EP117162.The article "A real time image processor for automatic bright spot
detection" presented at "Onzieme colloque sur le traitment du signal et des
images", GRETSI, (Nice, 1987), by G. Jacovitti and R. Cusani, discloses a
detection system based on

images which come from the vision subsystems (2) is centralised and where
the general operation of the system is monitored and controled, characterized in

that each said vision subsystem (2) consists of two vision cameras, infrared
