<ABSTRACT>
A digital signal recording and/or reproducing apparatus can 
maintain satisfactory continuity of a previously-recorded area and a 

postrecorded area by reducing the tracking displacement between the 
previously-recorded 
area and the postrecorded area. A signal from a 
playback amplifier (10) is supplied to a f1/f2 discriminating circuit 

(13), and a discriminated signal is supplied to a tracking information 
detector (14). A memory means (15) is controlled by a system 

controller (100). Tracking information from the detector (14) is 
supplied to the memory means (15) which independently memorizes 

tracking information signals of respective areas of a video signal, an 
audio signal, a subcode signal and an ITI signal. Tracking information 

signals of the respective areas memorized in the memory means (15) are 
selected by a selector means (16) formed of switches (16₁ to 16₄) and 

supplied to an averaging circuit (17). A tracking information signal 
averaged by the average circuit (17) is supplied to a servo circuit (8) 

which effects a tracking correction. For postrecording of a said area, 
tracking correction is performed using the tracking information for a 

predetermined area of said areas. A digital signal recording and/or 
reproducing method thereof also is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital signal recording
and/or reproducing apparatus and method for recording and/or
reproducing digital video/audio signals, for example, by using slant
tracks formed by a rotary head.A digital signal recording and/or reproducing apparatus is
known for recording and/or reproducing digital video/audio signals in
slant tracks formed by a rotary head. Such digital signal
recording/reproducing apparatus uses a recording format for one track
as shown in FIG. 1A of the accompanying drawings when digital
video/audio signals are recorded/reproduced.A rotary head (not shown) scans a magnetic tape in the
direction shown by an arrow x in FIG. 1A. In accordance with the
scanning direction of the rotary head, there are provided within one
track an information signal (ITI: insert and track information) area,
an audio signal area, a video signal area and a subcode signal area.
Respective margins are provided at the head tracing starting portion
and the head tracing ending portion. Further margins are provided
between the aforementioned areas.According to this recording format, the audio signal area,
the video signal area and the subcode signal area are arranged such
that so-called postrecording can be effected in the above-mentioned
areas independently. Specifically, a reference signal that is used as
a reference timing signal to switch the respective areas is provided in
the ITI area. The postrecording of each area is carried out by setting
the apparatus to the recording mode at the timing corresponding to each
area on the basis of the reference signal.However, in the digital signal recording and/or reproducing
apparatus using slant tracks formed by the rotary head, it is difficult
to obtain accurate linearity of the slant track. Specifically, it is
frequently observed that a slant track is shaped in a letter-S
configuration of a positive or opposite polarity as shown in FIG. 1B.
In this case, if the polarity of the S-shape of the slant track is
different for the recording apparatus and the reproducing apparatus,
there is then the risk that the recording apparatus and the reproducing
apparatus are not compatible with each other in use. In the digital signal recording and/or reproducing apparatus, a
displacement between the rotary head and the slant track (tracking displacement) is
constantly observed and the tracking is corrected by controlling the travel of the
recording medium (magnetic tape) so that displacements of the whole slant track are
averaged.However, in the digital
