<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a curable
composition for top coating, and more particularly to a
curable composition which has an improved excellent acid
resistance in addition to excellent other properties such
as water resistance, scratch resistance, appearance and
thermosetting property and which is suitable as top coat
for interior and exterior of buildings and for various
articles such as automobiles, industrial equipments, steel
furnitures, household electric appliances and plastic
products, particularly suitable as top coat for
automobiles.Paints containing a melamine resin such as
alkyd-melamine resin or acrylic melamine resin have
hitherto been mainly used for coating automobiles,
interior and exterior of buildings, industrial equipments,
steel furnitures, plastic products and the like. However,
these melamine resins involve the problems that harmful
formalin generates when curing the paints, and that the
cured coating films are damaged by acid rain because they
are poor in acid resistance. In particular, the problem
of acid rain resulting from air pollution assumes a
serious aspect in recent years, and there is observed a
phenomenon that etching, whitening or spotting occurs in
the coating films. JP-A-57 108 149 describes a curable composition
comprising a silanol-terminated polydiorganosiloxane, an organosiloxane and a
specific copolymer.It is known that vinyl copolymers having a
hydrolyzable silyl group or their blends with acrylic
polyols are curable and useful for the production of
paints having a good acid resistance and a good
weatherability, for instance, as disclosed in Japanese
Patent Publication Kokai No. 54-36395, No. 58-157810 and
No. 01-141952. These polymers or polymer blends have the
feature that since hydrolyzable silyl groups and alcoholic
hydroxyl groups form stable siloxane bonds or siloxy bonds
to cure, there can be formed coating films having good 
acid resistance and weatherability as compared with
melamine resins such as acrylic melamine resin and alkyd
melamine resin. Further, when the hydrolyzable silyl
groups are those shown by the formula (II):

wherein R3 is an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms,
R4 is H or a monovalent hydrocarbon group selected from an
alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, an aryl group
or an aralkyl group, and b is 0, 1 or 2, the coating films
are particularly superior in acid resistance and
weatherability, since the hydrolyzable silyl groups are
introduced into the polymer main chain through Si-C bond.The blend systems of a
