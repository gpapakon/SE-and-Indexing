<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to carbon fibers
and processes for preparing them. More specifically, it
relates to carbon fibers with excellent adhesion to
matrices and excellent composite properties, as well as
to processes for preparing them.Carbon fibers are used in composite reinforced
materials with a variety of matrices, and the adhesion of
the carbon fibers with a given matrix is important to
exhibit their characteristics in the reinforced material.Non-surface-treated carbon fibers generally
have insufficient adhesion to matrices, and they have
poor transverse properties such as delamination strength
and shear strength. Consequently, after carbonization or
graphitization carbon fibers are usually subjected to
oxidation treatment with electrolytic oxidation, gas or
liquid phase chemical oxidation, and an oxygen-containing
functional groups are introduced therein for the
improvement of wettability with the matrix.In regard to the surface characteristics of
carbon fibers by such oxidation treatment, in Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 4-361619 there
is a disclosed method of improving the adhesive strength
of a carbon fiber to a matrix by specifying functional
groups on the uppermost surface of the carbon fibers.
There are also disclosed carbon fibers which are
specified by not only surface oxygen concentration but
also surface nitrogen concentration as measured by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (for example, Japanese
Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 4-44016, and
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2-210059,
2-169763, 63-85167, and 62-276075). They do not
include a study of combinations with a sizing agent. 
Furthermore with mere specification of the surface
functional groups there have been drawbacks such as poor
adhesive force with matrices, particularly with low
reactive matrices.On the other hand, because carbon fibers and
graphite fibers are essentially stiff, brittle, lacking
in bindability, bending ability and abrasion resistance,
various types of sizing agents which prevent fluff
formation and thread breakage during processing
afterwards are normally added to carbon fibers to impart
bindability and improve the bending ability and abrasion
resistance. Thus, sizing agents have been developed and
used only as pastes or binders, to improve
processability, whereas virtually no research has been
conducted on the use of the sizing agents for the
improvement of adhesion to the matrices. Furthermore, no
studies have been made regarding adaptation of the
