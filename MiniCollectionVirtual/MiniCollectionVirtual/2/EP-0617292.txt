<ABSTRACT>
The conduction monitoring system includes at least one measurement module connected between two conductors of the network. A measurement cycle is divided into two periods. During the first period, the module measures (F1, F2) a first DC component (V1), representative of the stray DC components, of voltage applied to its terminals. During the second period, the measurement module injects a DC component of current into the network and measures (F3, F4) a second DC component (V2) of the voltage applied to its terminals. The difference (Vc) between the second and first components is used (F6) to detect a conduction fault, the line resistance upstream of the measurement module being proportional to this difference (Vc). The first and second components (V1, V2) are obtained by taking the mean, possibly weighted, of DC voltage samples measured during measurement periods (Tm1, Tm2) of duration less than or equal to the first and second periods.
