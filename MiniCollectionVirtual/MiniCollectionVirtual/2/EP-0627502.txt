<ABSTRACT>
A method of removing metal from a feedstock solution 
containing dissolved metal ions which comprises passing 

the feedstock through an annular gap, the inner surface 
of which is cathodic to the metal ion and the outer 

surface of which is anodic in such a way that the flow is 
turbulent. 
Also claimed is an apparatus for removing metal from 
a feedstock which comprises a reactor (20) afforded by an 

inner cathode tube (60), and an outer anode tube (70) spaced 
therefrom by a narrow annular gap, direct electric 

current supply means to the anode and cathode, pump means (15) 
for pumping feedstock into the said annular gap at high 

flow rates, a holding tank, pipe work connecting the 
holding tank (11) to the said pump means and pipe work 

connecting the end of the annular gap remote from the 
pump to the holding tank.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to recovery of metals
in metallic form from solutions of their salts. Such
processes are often referred to as "electrowinning"
processes. They have been used to recover metals from
ores as by treatment of leach solutions from ore dumps.
They have also been used to reduce metal ion content in
waste water from chemical processes and from industrial
processes such as electroplating and, recently, printed
circuit board manufacture, and from toxic metal
solutions.The invention will be described with particular
reference to removal of metal ions such as copper from
effluent from electroplating processes.One such prior art process which has found
considerable market acceptance in the UK is that
disclosed in GB 1423369. This passes the feedstock
effluent through an open topped tank containing flat or
curved rigid plane anodes of materials such as platinum
coated titanium mesh and cathodes of similar material or
stainless steel plate in the presence of small non-conductive
beads typically 0.5 to 2 mm in diameter.
These are described as forming a fluidized bed. A metal
foil is deposited on the cathode surfaces. When the
cathode is stainless steel plate there is a tendency for
the metal foil to peel away at the edges, contact a
neighbouring anode and short circuit the system. This
effect can be reduced in frequency by careful roughening
of the cathode surfaces by the operator before each
deposit cycle.The beads also tend to escape from the bath and flow
rates have to be kept below certain limits to stop this
happening. The system being open allows escape of any oxygen
hydrogen or chlorine generated by the electrolysis into
the atmosphere.GB 1423369 refers to limits on current density due
to the limiting effect of the rate of diffusion of ions
through the boundary layer. It also states that "it has
been proposed to use a fast flow of electrolyte through
the cell to break up the boundary layer". It also
mentions the use of rotating electrodes and as a third
approach forming the cathode as a fluidized bed of
conducting material.It also states that higher current efficiencies were
obtained using its system which were "far greater than
has been obtained at similar concentrations using cells
with fast flowing electrolyte ...". It does not state
what it means by fast flowing. GB 1423369 was published
on 4th February 1976 and this prejudice has persisted to
1993 since the process of GB 1423369 has substantially
the whole of the UK market.The present invention relates to a method of removing

<CLAIMS>
A method of removing metal from a solution
containing dissolved metal ions (hereafter the feedstock)

which comprises passing the feedstock through an annular
gap formed by a cathode and an anode, characterised in

that the gap is narrow such that the ratio of the length
of the gap (GL) to the initial gap width radially before

plating (IGWR) is in the range 50:1 to 500:1, and in that
the gap is formed between an inner cathode tube and an

outer anode tube, and in that the feedstock is passed
through the said gap at a flow rate which is turbulent

and which in conjunction with cross-section of the
annular gap provides a Reynolds number of the flow of at

least 2100, the inner surface of the gap being cathodic
to the metal ions in the solution and formed of an inert

metal which is smooth and is not attacked by the
solution, the outer surface of the gap being smooth and

anodic to the metal ions in the solution, and in that the
solution flow is inducted axially into the annular gap by

means of a pump coupled directly to the gap, whereby the
inflowing feedstock is distributed evenly to the annular

gap and passes therethrough at said turbulent flow rate,
and depositing the metal ions in the feedstock solution

on the cathodic surface.
A method as claimed in claim 1 in which the
ratio of the active cathode surface area of the cathode

in square decimetres to the volume in litres of the
annular gap (the reactor volume) is 100:1 to 5:1.
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 in
which the cathode is provided with at least one non-conductive

region extending along at least part of its
length such that metal deposited on the cathode has a

weakness region formed in it at the said non-conductive 

regions such as to facilitate removal of the deposited
metal as foil or sheet from the cathode surface.
Apparatus for removing metal from a feedstock
which comprises a reactor afforded by a cathode tube, and

an anode tube spaced therefrom by a annular gap, direct
electric current supply means to the anode and cathode to

effect deposition on the cathode of the metal in the
feedstock, pump means (15) for pumping feedstock into the

said annular gap, a holding tank (11), pipe work (14)
connecting the holding tank to the said pump means (15)

and pipe work (30,32,43) connecting the end of the
annular gap remote from the pump to the holding tank

gap formed between an inner cathode tube (60) and an

outer anode tube (70) spaced therefrom by the said narrow
annular gap, such that the ratio of the length of the gap

(GL) to the initial gap width radially before plating
(IGWR) is in the range 50:1 to 500:1,and in that the pump

means (15) are adapted to pump feedstock axially into the
said annular gap at turbulent flow rates, the said pump

means feeding the feedstock to the annular gap from a
pump outlet via an annular slot axially disposed relative

to the gap, whereby the said feedstock is distributed
axially and evenly to the said narrow annular gap and

passes therethrough at said turbulent flow rates.

axially disposed connector studs and the base of the
housing affords one or more co-operating axial holes for

the said studs, the studs being of a length such as to

which two or more connector studs are conductively 
secured at evenly spaced locations round the flange.
