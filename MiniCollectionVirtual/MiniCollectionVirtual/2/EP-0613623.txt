<ABSTRACT>
A trimming apparatus for a cigarette manufacturing 
machine comprises a pair of trimming disks(20) for 

trimming a cut tobacco layer formed on a tobacco 
band(6) by rotating, each disk having a plurality of 

pockets(22) on its peripheral edge, and a synchronizing 
device(42) in a power transmission line which 

leads to the disks(20). The synchronizing device(42) 
can adjust a rotational phase of the pockets(22) of 

the trimming disks(20) in accordance with the cutting 
timing for a formed cigarette rod during operation of 

the cigarette manufacturing machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
trimming a layer of cut tobacco formed on a tobacco
band of a cigarette manufacturing machine, and more
particularly, to a trimming apparatus for
intermittently increasing the thickness of the cut
tobacco layer in the traveling direction of the
tobacco band.In a cigarette manufacturing machine, a layer of
cut tobacco is first formed on a tobacco band running
in one direction. Then, the cut tobacco layer on the
tobacco band is adjusted to a predetermined thickness
by means of a trimming apparatus, and is fed from the
tobacco band onto a paper web traveling in the one
direction. As the paper web travels in this manner,
the tobacco layer thereon is wrapped in the web,
thereby forming a continuous cigarette rod. As the
cigarette rod passes through a cutting section of the
cigarette manufacturing machine at a predetermined
traveling speed, it is cut into individual cigarettes
with a given length.In order to prevent the cut tobacco from falling
off from the cut ends of each cigarette, the tobacco
filling density of those portions of the cigarette rod
in which the rod is to be cut is made higher than that
of the other portions. To attain this, the trimming apparatus has a
function to increase intermittently the filling
density of the cut tobacco in the cigarette rod to be
formed, along the axis of the rod. An example of the
trimming apparatus of this type is described in Japanese
Patent Publication(KOKOKU) No. 51-17200.This disclosed trimming apparatus comprises a
pair of trimming disks. The disks are arranged right
under the tobacco band with their respective
peripheral surfaces in rolling contact with each other
so that they are rotated in opposite directions. As
the cut tobacco layer, along with the tobacco band,
passes the pair of trimming disks, therefore, a
surplus of the tobacco layer is scraped off by the
rotating disks, whereby the thickness of the tobacco
layer is made uniform.However, each trimming disk has a plurality of
pockets on its peripheral edge, and each pocket of one
disk and its corresponding pocket of the other disk
cyclically meet each other right under the tobacco
band as the disks rotate. Thus, the thickness of the
cut tobacco layer on the tobacco band is not uniform
with respect to the traveling direction, and is
increased by a margin equivalent to the depth of each
pocket every time the corresponding pockets of the
pair of trimming disks meet just under the tobacco
band. In consequence, the cut tobacco layer fed from
the tobacco band

<CLAIMS>
A trimming apparatus for a cigarette manufacturing machine which includes a
tobacco band (6) travelling in one direction so that a layer cut tobacco is formed

on a lower surface of the bank (6), a forming section (8) for forming a
continuous cigarette rod from the cut tobacco layer and a paper web, and

delivering the formed cigarette rod at a predetermined speed, and a cutting
section (14) for cutting the formed cigarette rod into individual cigarettes and

outputting cutting signals, said trimming apparatus comprising a trimming disk
