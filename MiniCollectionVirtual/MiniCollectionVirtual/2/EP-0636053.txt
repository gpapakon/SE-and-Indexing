<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to manufacture of thin 
polymer film by a novel pulsed laser evaporation 
process. The technique of laser evaporation, known in the 
art as laser ablation, has been applied to a large class 
of materials ranging from polymers to semiconductors and 
dielectrics. This technique has been applied 
extensively to form thin films of inorganic material, 
such as ceramic oxides exhibiting superconductivity, to 
fill the demands of the electronics industry for device 
applications such as radio frequency and microwave 
technology, see, for example, D. Dijkkamp at al., Appl. 
Phys. Lett., 51, 619-621 (1987). Oriented silicon 
carbide films by laser ablation of silicon carbide 
targets are described by L. Rimai et al., Appl. Phys. 
Lett. 59 (18), 28 October 1991, pp. 2266-2268, wherein 
it is noted that the resulting films often contain 
material other than SiC. Japanese Patent 03166358 
describes a method for producing stoichiometric films of 
inorganic oxide, nitride and carbide by irradiating a 
target by a laser and depositing the clusters so formed 
onto a substrate to form a thin film, wherein plasma is 
generated synchronously with the laser irradiation. Laser ablation applied to organic materials, 
particularly polymers, has been confined primarily to 
etching, i.e., selective removal of polymeric material  
 
from a polymeric target to form a patterned surface on 
the target. For example, the photoetching of polyimide 
is described by S. Mihailov et al., J. Appl. Phys. 69 
(7), 1 April 1991, pp.4092-4102. Laser ablation of 
fluoropolymer composite laminates to render the 
laminates absorptive to ultra violet radiation is 
described in U. S. Patent 4,915,981. This invention provides for a process for producing a 
thin film of a first addition polymer on a substrate by 
bombarding a target consisting essentially of a second 
addition polymer comprising fluoropolymer or polyethylene, with radiation from a pulsed laser in 
a vacuum or gas atmosphere (i.e., gaseous fluorocarbon 
or inert gas) to form a plume of components of said 
second addition polymer; and depositing said plume on 
the substrate, whereby a film of said first addition 
polymer is formed. The first and second addition 
polymer may be identical or different. Figure 1 is a schematic view of an apparatus useful 
in the practice of this invention. The target materials used in the practice of this 
invention consist essentially of addition polymers. 
Addition polymers are polymers which are formed by 
radical chain
