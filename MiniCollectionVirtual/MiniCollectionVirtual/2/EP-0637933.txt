<ABSTRACT>
Provided are methods and compositions for detecting and treating normal, hypoplastic, ectopic or remnant tissue, organ or cells in a mammal. The method comprises parenterally injecting a mammalian subject, at a locus and by a route providing access to said tissue or organ, with a composition comprising antibody/fragment which specifically binds to targeted organ, tissue or cell. The antibody/fragment may be administered alone, or labeled or conjugated with an imaging, therapeutic, cytoprotective or activating agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of antibody-cytotoxic agent conjugates in ablating normal
cells or tissues.Normal tissues and organs have been imaged by magnetic resonance imaging techniques,
but not with the use of imaging-enhancing contrast agents, and not with antibody-conjugated
imaging agents.Methods of imaging tumors and infectious lesions using labeled antibodies and antibody
fragments which specifically bind markers produced by or associated with tumors or infectious
lesions have been disclosed, inter alia, in Hansen et al., U. S. Pat. No. 3,927,193 and Goldenberg,
U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,331,647, 4,348,376, 4,361,544, 4,468,457, 4,444,744, 4,460,459 and 4,460,561,
and in related pending applications U.S. Ser. Nos. 609,607 and 633,999. See also DeLand et al.,
J. Nucl. Med., 20,1243-50(1979).These methods use radiolabeled antibodies which specifically bind to markers produced
by or associated with tumors or infectious lesions, and result in a "positive" image, i.e., uptake of
radioactivity attached to the antibody in the structure involved with tumor or infectious lesion
and having the appropriate antibody target, thus permitting a visualization of the involved
structure. Further improvements in the specificity and resolution of these methods is achieved by
the use of various substraction techniques which are also disclosed in the aforementioned
references, and which enable background, non-specific radioactivity to be distinguished from
specific uptake by the tumor or lesion.A need continues to exist for therapeutic methods which are more sensitive and specific
and for organ therapeutic reagents and methods with high specificity for differentiation of
particular organs and tissues from surrounding structures.One object of the present invention is to provide agents for ablating normal
cells and tissues as part of a therapeutic intervention.Upon further study of the specification and appended claims, further objects and
advantages of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art.The present invention provides the use of a conjugate of an antibody or antibody fragment and a
cytotoxic agent in the manufacture of a medicament for parenteral use in ablating normal cells or
tissues:
in bone marrow ablation in a patient prior to regrafting with normal bone marrow
cells;in spleen ablation for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura; orin the treatment of endometriosis
   wherein:
said antibody or antibody fragment is specific to a marker associated with or produced by
the cell to be
