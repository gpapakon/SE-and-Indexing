<ABSTRACT>
A network architecture is designed to allow a communications service 
subscriber to select a signaling provider independently of a) the transport carriers 

which control the local loops for particular communications services, and b) the 
providers of those services. Upon the establishment of a signaling connection from a 

subscriber's terminal device to the signaling provider's network, the latter requests 
those services from the service providers selected by the subscriber for delivery over 

the local loops of the transport providers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to communication systems. For most communications services, prior art communications network 
architecture limits a subscriber's ability to freely select services and/or service 
providers. For example, most subscribers are constrained to receive their local 
communications services exclusively from the carrier e.g., a local phone company, 
or a cable television operator, serving the geographical area where those subscribers 
live. Thus, those subscribers are limited to the services provided by their serving 
local carrier(s) singly or in agreement with other carriers. For some other 
communications services, such as long distance or cellular communications services, 
subscribers typically have more freedom in the selection of service providers. 
However, the inflexibility of today's communications network architecture prevents 
subscribers from freely mixing and matching features from different carriers for a 
particular service. Thus, a problem of the prior art is a rigid communications 
architecture which does not allow subscribers to select feature and/or services from 
competing carriers on a call-by-call basis or on a subscription basis. Another problem of the prior art is the inability of end-users who have 
access/egress facilities to multiple competing carriers to specify a particular carrier 
from which they want to receive incoming communications services. We have realized that the root causes of the aforementioned prior art 
problems can be traced back to the logical dependency of end-user signaling systems 
on end-user switching points. Specifically, the end-user switching points originate, 
process and terminate signaling messages for end-user devices. Because of that 
dependency, the end points for user signaling are switching systems that are 
generally managed and owned by a single communications carrier, such as a Local 
Exchange Carrier (LEC), a cellular communications provider or a cable television 
operator. Thus, the communication carrier that controls the local loop associated 
with the terminal device of a subscriber also controls the nature and type of signaling 
messages for all communications services received and requested by that subscriber 
over that loop. Hence, the subscriber is at the mercy of the loop-controlling 
communications carrier (transport provider) for the type of communications services  
 
and features available to that subscriber. The present invention is directed to a communications network 
architecture in which, a subscriber is

<CLAIMS>
A communications network comprising 
   at least one signaling node for communicating unprocessed signaling 

messages to a subscriber's device, said signaling node operating under the control of 
a signaling provider pre-selected by the subscriber; 

   at least one service node for providing at least one communication 
service to the subscriber's device upon request from the signaling node, said service 

node operating under the control of a service provider selected by the subscriber; and 
   a transport system for delivering a) signaling messages from the at least 

one signaling node to the subscriber's device, and b) the at least one communications 
service from the service node to the subscriber's device, said transport system 

operating under the control of a transport provider logically independently of the 
signaling provider. 
The invention of claim 1 wherein said service provider is selected by 
said subscriber on a call-by-call basis. 
The invention of claim 1 wherein said service provider is pre-selected 
by said subscriber. 
The invention of claim 1 further comprising 
   means for exchanging signaling messages between said subscriber's 

signaling node and one or more other particular signaling nodes under the control of 
one or more other signaling providers pre-selected by one or more other subscribers 

associated with one or more other terminal devices to which said subscriber's 
terminal device wants to communicate; and 

   means for establishing one or more end-to-end routes for 
communications between said subscriber's terminal device and said one or more 

other terminal devices. 
The invention of claim 4 further comprising 
   means for determining service providers for incoming communications 

pre-selected by said one or more other subscribers for the establishment of said one 
or more end-to-end routes. 
The invention of claim 4 wherein said determining means includes
 

   means for identifying from a profile pre-stored in databases connected to 
the one or more other signaling nodes the addresses of the service providers. 
In a communication network, a method of completing a call between a 
caller and a service provider, said method comprising the steps of: 

   establishing a signaling connection from the caller to a node of a 
particular signaling provider preselected by the caller, th
e connection being 
established via a transport provider's node which communicates unaltered said 

caller's signaling messages to the signaling provider's node; 
   processing said signaling messages in said signaling provider's node by 

determining from the signaling messages a) at least one type of communications 
service requested by the caller, and b) an associated provider of said communications 

service; and 
   completing the call between said communications service provider and 

said caller via said transport provider node. 
The invention of claim 7 wherein said communications service 
provider is selected by said caller on a call-by-call basis. 
The method of claim 7 wherein the call is directed to one or more 
called parties, said method further comprising the steps of: 

   establishing a signaling connection from the caller's signaling node to 
called parties' signaling nodes identified by address information in the signaling 

messages; 
   determining at the called parties' signaling nodes addresses of transport 

providers pre-selected by the called parties for incoming communications services 
destined for said called parties; and 

   completing the call using the caller's service provider facilities and the 
called-parties-selected transport provider facilities.
