switching-on series (or compound) start of shunt normal operation 

according to the load discloses the operation of switch device (SW101) 
for auxiliary exciting power supply to excite series field winding 

(S101) during normal operation and further appear the characteristics of 
high-efficiency and low-loss shunt operation, while series or compound 

start or overload operation is formed to obtain excellent start or 
overload characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a DC motor having an
auxiliary excitation power supply which is switched on to
excite the series field winding of the motor during normal
operation, and to provide the motor with the characteristics
of high-efficiency and low-loss shunt operation, and series
or compound start or overload operation.Known DC motors of this type are described in FR-A-2
353 159 and US-A-4 171 506.The present invention provides a DC motor arrangement comprising a
main power source having first and second terminals; an
auxiliary power supply having first and second terminals; a
series field winding having first and second ends; and an
armature having first and second ends; the first end of the
armature being connected to the first terminal of the main
power source, and the second end of the armature being
connected to the first end of the series field winding; the
first and second terminals of the auxiliary power supply
being respectively connected to the first and second ends of
the series field winding; and the series field winding being
connected to the main power source via a switch having a
first switch terminal connected to the first end of the
series field winding, a second switch terminal connected to
the second end of the series field winding, and a third
switch terminal connected to the second terminal of the main
power source; the arrangement being characterised in that the first
switch terminal is connected to the third switch terminal
during normal motor operation, thereby to connect the second
terminal of the main power source directly to the armature,
that the second switch terminal is connected to the
third switch terminal during start-up or an overload
condition of the motor, thereby to connect the series field
winding in series between the armature and the second
terminal of the main power source, and that a
choking diode is connected in series between the auxiliary
power supply and the series field winding. The invention will now be described in greater detail, by
way of example, with reference to the drawings, in which:-
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram showing the principal elements
of a circuit according to a first preferred embodiment of
the invention;Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram showing a second preferred
embodiment of the invention; andFig 3 is a schematic diagram showing a third preferred
embodiment of the invention.A conventional series (or compound) motor often has
excellent current-to-torque characteristics during start-up
and overload operation. However, it is relatively
