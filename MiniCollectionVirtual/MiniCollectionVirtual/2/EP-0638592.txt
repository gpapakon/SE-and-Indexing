<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method for preparing anionic, cationic or non-ionic 
polymeric microemulsions comprising a multi-step process 

to achieve high solids and low emulsifier and oil content 
and/or small aqueous phase droplets. The polymeric 

microemulsions are useful in papermaking as retention aids, in 
solid-liquid separation as flocculants and in enhanced oil 

recovery as a drive fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing water-in-oil 
polymer microemulsions. Polymer-containing microemulsions are known to those skilled 
in the art. They are stable, transparent water-in-oil systems 
that are stabilized by surfactants. Water soluble polymers 
such as polyacrylamide are effective in papermaking to improve 
drainage, formation and retention. Fast drainage and greater 
retention of fines contribute to lower cost. In addition, they 
are useful in the flocculation of suspended solids, such as 
sewage sludge and in the thickening of cellulosic paper pulp 
suspensions. The increasing cost of materials has made it 
highly desirable to produce flocculating agents which produce 
higher separation at lower dose levels. Finally, they are used 
in enhanced oil recovery processes as drive fluids to push 
through underground oil reservoirs. Polymerization of monomers in emulsions is well known to those 
skilled in the art. Polymers produced by these techniques have 
found widespread industrial application. Further, some of the 
techniques described in the prior art disclose a variety of 
multi-stage addition techniques for use in emulsion 
polymerization methods. Typically, the prior art emulsion 
disclosures teach adding the second stage as an emulsion and 
have high aqueous content or no oil. The Rohm and Haas product literature entitled "Emulsion 
Polymerization of Acrylic Monomers" pp. 7, 14-18, teaches 
multi-stage emulsion polymerization of ethyl acrylate to 
achieve higher solids (43-46%), and to control heat. However,  
 
the reference discloses polymerization in an aqueous emulsion 
with the later steps comprising further addition of the 
aqueous emulsion. Naidus, "Emulsion Polymers for Paints," Industrial and 
Engineering Chemistry, v. 45, n. 4 (1953), discusses adding 
monomer, or monomer in an aqueous emulsion, continuously 
during polymerization to provide a homogeneous composition. 
The author teaches that the monomer addition technique gives 
emulsions of smaller aqueous droplet size because of a larger 
emulsifier to monomer ratio; and that the monomer emulsion 
addition technique is more stable with less coagulum since 
adequate emulsification is not dependent upon the agitation. Taft, United States Patent No. 3,297,621, teaches a two-step 
emulsion polymerization process to control heat wherein the 
first step comprises adding non-emulsified monomer to a 
reactor containing catalyst and an emulsifying solution and 
the second step comprises adding an aqueous
