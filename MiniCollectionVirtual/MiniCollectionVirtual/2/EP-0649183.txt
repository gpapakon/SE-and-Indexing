<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to radio broadcasting with the aid of rotatable antennae with wire dipoles. Two separate feed channels (G1, J, G4, Sg, Qg, Khg, Kbg; G2, J, G3, Sd, Qd, KHd, Kbd) start respectively from two transmitters (E1, E2) pass through the joint (J) which separates the fixed part from the moving part of the rotatable antenna, then leave horizontally, on either side of the mast, bearing on the support structure of the rotatable antenna, and then again rise vertically to the feed points of the dipoles of two separate vertical groups of dipoles; it is thus possible to carry out two simultaneous transmissions from the same rotatable antenna. Application to shortwave broadcasting.
