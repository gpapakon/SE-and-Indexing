<ABSTRACT>
A device for connecting the interior of the stomach 
through the wall to a location outside the stomach, for 

instance for feeding purposes, comprises a flexible hose and 
a holding member on the end of the hose for fixedly holding 

the hose on the inside of the stomach wall, in addition to a 
bracket placeable externally on the skin of the human body 

and engaging the hose. According to the invention the 
bracket has a part clampingly receiving the hose and a bend 

piece connecting through roughly a right angle onto the 
clamping part. The flexible hose is hereby bent roughly 

parallel to the body and the hose can be used as lever 
during placing and removal of the bracket, which reduces the 

load on the vicinity of the wound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a bracket for securing
a flexible hose protruding from the interior of an organ
of the human body, in particular the stomach, through an
opening in the wall to a location outside the body, said
bracket comprises a clamping part clampingly receiving
the hose, a bend piece connecting through roughly a right
angle to the clamping part, and a fixing part intended
for placing on the skin, in which said clamping part runs
roughly parallel to said fixing part and consists of
successive flexible cylindrical portions.Such a bracket is used for medical purposes,
particularly for patients who are not capable of taking
in food in the normal manner. In order to introduce food
directly into the stomach a flexible hose is introduced
via the oesophagus, which hose is carried to the outside
via an orifice in the stomach wall and in the tissue. On
the end part of the inserted hose a plate-like holding
member is arranged to hold the hose inside the stomach in
operationally reliable manner. The other end part of the
hose is secured in a bracket.GB-A-2147811 describes a bracket for anchoring
catheter tubing to the skin of a patient. The bracket
includes an arcuate passageway for receiving and
redirecting the tubing. The passageway is externally
accessible along its length by manually spreading the two
halves of the bracket along a slit. The slit is held
closed by means of a cable tie which is tightened in an
annular channel grooved into the circumference of the
bracket whereby the tubing is prevented from sliding
through or from the passageway. In order to enable
replacement or cleaning of the tubing and the bracket the
tie must be severed to permit removal of the tubing from
the passageway. Severing the tie is difficult as the
walls of the channel are obstructing the passageway of 
severing means in order to be placed under the cable tie.
Applying this known bracket is also difficult because at
the same moment the two halves of the bracket has to be
held closed, the cable tie has to be applied into the
channel and the free end of the tie must be pulled while
the tie has to be prevented from slipping in the channel.The invention has for its object to obviate
these drawbacks in a simple manner.This is achieved according to the invention in
that a gap is provided in the wall of each cylindrical
portion, said gaps extending parallel to the clamping
part and being arranged substantially diametrically
opposite each other in said successive cylindrical
portions.The bracket according to the invention can
