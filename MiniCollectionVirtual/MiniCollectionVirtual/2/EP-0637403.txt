<ABSTRACT>
A process for forming a three-dimensional structure etched in a substrate (501) with perfect convex corners includes partitioning the structure into two features (502-504, 505) such that the exterior corners are formed by the intersection (506) of the two features; etching the first feature (502-504); forming an etch mask on the surface and on the substrate of the etched first feature; opening a window in the etch mask on the substrate to define the second feature; and etching the second feature (505), thereby obtaining the desired structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MICROMACHINING PROCESS FOR MAKING PERFECT EXTERIOR CORNERIN AN ETCHABLE SUBSTRATEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThis invention relates to the field of forming three- dimensional structures in an etchable crystalline substrate material, in particular to the formation of perfect exterior corners intersected by features formed in the material using micromachining. Description of Prior ArtThe ability to fabricate precise, three-dimension structures in an etchable substrate material, particularly in silicon, relies to a large degree on the ability to perform so-called anisotropic etching of the single crystal silicon substrate. Anisotropic etches have the property of etching certain crystallographic planes of silicon much more rapidly than others by using some etchants such as mixtures of KOH and water or mixtures of ethylene diamine, pyrocatechol, and water. All of these etches etch the {111} silicon plane much more slowly than the other low order {100} or {110} planes.The two most common surface orientations of silicon wafers are (100) and (111) . Since the etch rate of {111} planes is so low, (100) silicon is the preferred orientation for device fabrication. In (100) silicon, a flat is provided on each wafer along a <110> direction. In this orientation, the {111} planes intersect the (100) surface parallel and perpendicular to the wafer flat, at an angle of 54.74Â° with respect to the surface as shown in Figure 1A in cross section.If an opening in an etch mask is opened to form a rectangle, an anisotropic etchant will etch down exposing the {111} planes, to form a V-grove as shown in Figure 1A 

and IB in a plan view.If a window in an etch mask is formed which is more complicated in shape than an rectangle, any convex protrusion will etch back to the "farthest" {111} plane, given enough time, as shown in Figures 2A and 2B.If one wants a convex corner, for example, at point A shown in Figure 2B, use this exact L-shape as the etch mask, and put the substrate in KOH and water, the corner is etched back as shown in Fig. 3A and the protruding mask feature breaks off. So if it is desirable to have a convex corner which is not etched back, a so-called corner compensation technique may be used, in which an additional mask feature is added to the corner, which etches back just the right amount to leave the desired three-dimension feature at the exterior corner. One such corner compensation pattern is to add a square protrusion at the exterior corner as shown in Figure 3B. As the etch proceeds

CLAIMS
What is claimed is:
1. A process for forming a three-dimensional structure having at least one exterior corner in an etchable substrate comprising: partitioning said structure into a first feature and a second feature, such that the exterior corners are formed by an intersection of the two features; etching said first feature; forming an etch mask on the surface and on the substrate of the etched first feature; opening a window in the etch mask on the substrate to define said second feature; and etching said second feature, thereby obtaining said exterior corner.
2. A process as defined in claim 1, wherein said window for the second feature surrounds at the substrate principal surface one end of the etched first feature.
3. A process as defined in claim 1, wherein said first feature is a set of parallel grooves and said second feature is a groove perpendicular to the set of parallel grooves.
