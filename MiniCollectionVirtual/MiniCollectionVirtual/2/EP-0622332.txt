<ABSTRACT>
A heat and flame resisting cushion material in which fire resisting short crimped fibers and elastic thermoplastic fibers are 
mixed and dispersed in an aggregate of short non-elastic crimped fibers with the interlacing points between the elastic fibers and 

other fibers thermally fused. The cushion material may consist of an inner layer of a fiber aggregate and an outer layer surrounding 

the inner layer and composed of the same cushion material as described above. These cushion materials are useful for a seat 
for a vehicle, such as an airplane and a racing car.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cushioning structure
having enhanced heat-resistance and flame-retardancy, and
a vehicle seat molded therefrom.In recent years, there is an increasing demand for
imparting enhanced heat resistance and flame retardancy to
cushioning articles used for, for example, household
furniture, beds, particularly beds in hospitals and
facilities for old people, and vehicle seats in transport
facilities including airplanes. Especially, as is well
known, very strict flame retardancy requirements for
airplane seats must be satisfied under Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) in the United States for saving a life
from the fire.To meet the above-mentioned demand, flame-retarded
polyurethanes are widely used which are made by
incorporating a phosphorus-containing flame retardant in a
polyurethane-forming material in the process of making
polyurethane. However, there is a problem such that, with
an enhancement of flame retardancy, a flame-retarded
polyurethane cushioning article becomes to feel hard and
becomes dense and heavy, and thus, the comfortableness
is reduced. Comfortableness and light-weight are always
required for cushioning articles, and especially, there is
recently a strong demand for light-weight seats of
automobiles and airplanes. Further, polyurethane cushioning
articles have a problem in industrial waste incineration.Cushioning articles comprising a wadding of polyester
fibers have also been recently used, in which the fibers are 
either bonded at intersecting points of fibers by a resin
binder or a low-temperature-melting fiber binder, or not
bonded. The cushioning articles of polyester fibers, which
are not bonded at intersecting points of fibers, are apt to
be deformed during the use because the wadding is not fixed
and the fibers are not restricted in movement, and their
bulkiness and resilience are reduced because the crimp of
fibers fades away. The cushioning articles of polyester
fibers, which are bonded at intersecting points of fibers,
also have similar problems to some extent because the
bonding at intersecting points of fibers is not stable and
the crimp of fibers fades away. Further, in these
cushioning articles, with an enhancement of flame-retardancy,
the bulkiness and resilience are reduced and the
comfortableness becomes lost.JP-B-55-30875 (corresponding to FR-A-23 46 487) discloses a
cushioning structure made of flame-retardant staple fibers and
non-elastic polyester staple fibers in the form of a web.WO-A-86/06114 discloses a cushion core or an aircraft
