<ABSTRACT>
A system for signalling the presence of selected 
ion species in a gaseous sample of an ion mobility sensor 

(10), having a unidirectional field provided between first 
and second electrodes (16, 18) positioned a selected 

distance apart. An ionization source (35) generates ions 
in the sensor and a trigger controller (42) allows ions to 

enter the region (12) between the first and second electrodes 
at a time t₁. The ions then arrive at the second 

electrode at a time t₂. A transimpedance amplifier (38) 
converts the ion charges to voltage signals. The presence 

of selected ion species is determined by circuitry that is 
activated by the trigger controller at t₂. The species are 

preferably analyzed by directing the amplifier output to an 
analog to digital converter (56) and then to a digital 

signal processor (58). The ions may alternatively be 
analyzed by generating a logic pulse representing a selected 

ion species when the amplifier output exceeds a preset 
value. An alarm signal is output when the logic pulse is 

coincident at an AND gate (46) with a logic pulse representing 
the species' travel time from the first electrode 

to the second electrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to devices for 
quantitatively measuring the concentrations of constituents 
of multicomponent gaseous samples, and more particularly to 
devices that conduct such measurements based upon the 
mobility of ions in a drift region. Ion mobility spectroscopy is a powerful and well 
known method for providing quantitative measurements of the 
composition of a gaseous environment. In this context, the 
ion mobility sensor is usually designed for operation at 
atmospheric pressure although in principle it can operate 
at higher or lower pressures. The ion mobility sensor 
typically is comprised of two identifiable regions: (i) an 
ionization region where ions are formed representative of 
the gas sample to be analyzed, and (ii) a drift region into 
which the ions are injected and allowed to drift in an 
electric field before collection. During the ions' drift in the drift region, the 
ions make many collisions with the sample gas and their 
motion in the electric field is characterized by the ion 
mobility. Since the ion mobility is a function of ion 
mass, ions of different mass segregate during their drift. 
Thus, by measuring the ion arrival time spectrum at the 
collector, a signature of the gas sample composition is 
obtained. Although positive ion spectra provide a selective  
 
signature for all gaseous species, the additional 
monitoring of negative ion spectra (for electronegative 
species) can provide supplementary information for either 
diagnostic or calibration purposes. In currently available commercial instruments, the 
dimensions of the ionization region are comparable in 
magnitude to those of the drift region. The ions are 
produced primarily through ion-molecule reactions, where 
the impurity molecules of interest are ionized as a result 
of collisions with primary ions not necessarily derived 
from the background sample gas but rather from carrier 
gases deliberately introduced into the reaction region. 
These primary ions are produced as a result of collisions 
of beta particles emitted from a Ni-63 radioactive source 
(located within the ionization region) interacting with the 
sample and/or carrier gas. Since the beta particles are 
produced continuously, the ion production process is 
continuous and the species present in the ionization region 
represent an equilibrium composition developed over a 
relatively long time and which includes (deliberately in 
the case of the use of a carrier gas) ions produced as a 
result of ion molecule chemistry. Thus, in
