<ABSTRACT>
The amount of small airbone particles of rice hull ash is minimized by treating the particles with a coating of vegetable oil and/or glyceride utilizing a screw conveyor (30) and spray nozzles (44). The coating is applied in and on the surface of the particles without filling the porous spaces within the rice hull ash particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rice
hull ash composition according to the precharacterising part of claim 1
and to a method of preparing a rice hull ash composition.Paddy rice harvested from the fields includes a
hull surrounding the rice grain. Rice hulls are
separated from the paddy rice, usually after the paddy
rice has been subjected to processing operations.There has been considerable effort to find
beneficial and profitable uses for the hulls which may be
considered as an inevitable product of all rice
processing. Rice hulls are disposed of by returning them
to the field, or using them in animal litter and in
animal feed, or as a carrier and in plastics, and other
assorted ways. One of the other major ways in which rice
hulls are used is as fuel. To use the rice hulls as
fuel, they are simply burned. The burned rice hulls
produce an ash which is also used in many ways including
in animal litter and in plastics. The ash is also used
as a component of refractory material and as a very
effective insulating material and to insulate molten
steel.In steel mills, rice hull ash is applied as an
insulating covering over ladles of molten steel and
tundishes while the molten steel is being held prior to
further processing. The insulation effect afforded by
this "blanket" of rice hull ash minimizes heat loss from
the molten steel.Use and treatment of rice hull ash has been an
active topic in the patent literature. There have been
numerous efforts to improve on the basic technology. For
example, U.S. Patent No. 4,442,130 teaches a method for
processing rice which utilizes the hulls. In the method,
rice hulls are fed into a burner unit where they are
burned in two stages to produce ash and relatively clean 
hot gases. The hot gases are cycled for use in a heat
treated phase of the rice.Unfortunately, one especially undesirable condition
persists. Rice hull ash includes small particles which
become airborne. These airborne particles can be very
irritating as they are essentially a black dust, and they
get into the eyes and nose of anyone in the vicinity of the
ash. Additionally, these black particles leave a dusty film.US-A-4295891 describes a blanket powder for covering a
molten metal bath comprising rice hull ash and from 5 to 50%
by weight of non-calcined rice hulls. The presence of the
non-calcined rice hulls results in reduced airborne particle
release. The blanket powder mixture may optionally also
contain a small amount of mineral oil, such as engine sump
drainage oil, to complete the supression of
