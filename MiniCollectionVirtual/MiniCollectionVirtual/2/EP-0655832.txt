<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a circuit arrangement for limiting levels of distortion of audio signals, which levels of distortion are produced during reproduction in a radio receiver having at least one output stage, a signal which characterises a predetermined degree of modulation can be picked off at the output stage. The signal which is conducted via an integration element forms a voltage describing the harmonic distortion factor (total harmonic distortion) and, by means of a predetermined characteristic, a manipulated variable which is forwarded to an actuator for amplifying the audio signals.
