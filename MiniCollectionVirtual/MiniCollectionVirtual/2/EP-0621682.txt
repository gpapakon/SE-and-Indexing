<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for dividing an input signal, with frequency f1, by a parametric number with ratio M/m in order to provide an output signal with frequency f2. This device employs a method of division by cycle stealing, and includes means for choosing the cycles to be withdrawn from the signal with frequency f1, so as to supply a signal with frequency f2 having phase jumps of minimum amplitude. Application to signal processing.

Device for dividing an electric signal of frequency f1 
by a number of ratio M/m in order to supply an electric signal 

of frequency f2, in which the frequency f2 is below the 
frequency f1, characterized in that it comprises: 


shaping means (10) receiving a signal of frequency f1 and 
able to emit a logic periodic signal at said frequency f1, 
means (1) for storing iterative values (... Ri, Ri+1, ...) 
having a first input (e1a) connected to the shaping means 

in order to receive the periodic signal emitted at the frequency 
f1, 
information determination means (2) having an input (e3) 
connected to an output (s1) of the storage means for receiving 

the iterative value Ri stored in said storage means, 
said determination means being able, on the one hand, to 

determine the polarity sign of the iterative value and convert 
said polarity sign into a binary information (I) which 

can be in a first or second state, said information being 
supplied to a first output (s3) and, on the other hand, 

determine a frequency signal (f2) on the basis of this information 
relative to the iterative value, 
arithmetic means (5) comprising: 

a conditional operation circuit (6) able to receive on a 
first input (e6a) connected to the first output of the 

determination means, the said binary information, on a 
second input the value m and optionally on a third input the 

value M and able to supply on an output, either the value 
m-M, or the value m as a function of the binary information 

state, and 
an adder circuit able to receive on a fourth input (e7b) 
connected to the output of the storage means, the iterative 

value and on a fifth input connected to the output of the 
conditional operation circuit the value m-M or m, and supply 

for each period of the frequency signal a new iterative  
 

value (Ri+1) transmitted to the storage means by an output (s7) 
connected to a second input (e1b) of said storage means; and in 

that the ration M/m is a parametrized value, in which m is a parametrized 
value and M is a particular value previously defined in 

the conditional operation circuit. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the information 
determination means incorporate a first logic circuit (3) 

able to determine the polarity sign of the iterative value and 
convert said polarity sign into a binary information (I). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the determination 
means incorporate a second logic circuit (4) able to 

determine the frequency at which the binary information is in its 
first state, said frequency corresponding to the frequency (f2). 
Device according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the conditional operation circuit comprises a circuit able 

to perform a subtraction of the values m and M. 
Device according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the conditional operation circuit comprises a circuit able 

to select, as a function of the binary information (I), the 
modification or non-modification of the signal of m in order to 

supply at the output of the conditional operation circuit, the 
value of m with an optionally modified sign. 
Device according to any one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that it comprises a frequency dividing circuit (8) having an 

input connected to the output of the determination means and ensuring 
a division of the frequency f2, obtained at the output of said 

determination means, by an integer K in order to have a division 
ratio (MxK)/m.  

 
Device for measuring a frequency f4 from the relation 
m = [(MXK)/f3)]
 x f4 in which (MxK)/f3 is a conversion factor 
between the measured frequency f4 and a digital data item m, 

characterized in that it is constituted by a device according to 
any one of the preceding claims.
