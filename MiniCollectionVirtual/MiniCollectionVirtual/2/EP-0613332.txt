<ABSTRACT>
A composite transversely plastic interconnect for a 
microcarrier produces a carrier-to-substrate bond having low 

electrical resistance and high mechanical strength, 
significant bond height to mediate TCE mismatch between 

dissimilar carrier and substrate materials, and sufficient 
gap between the carrier and the substrate to permit effective 

post solder cleaning of the interconnect. A contact array 
consisting of solder balls (24) is placed directly onto 

either of a carrier (30) or a substrate (20) interconnect 
surface with a stencil positioned to the chosen interconnect 

surface. The solder balls (24) may have a selected melting 
temperature. Add
itionally, the solder balls (24) may have a 
metallic coating, such as nickel or copper, or molten solder. 

The carrier (30) and substrate (20) are joined by mating an 
interconnect surface of each and applying heat. Solder paste 

(39) may be applied to one of the interconnect surfaces to 
add additional height to the joint and compensate for lack of 

coplanarity between the carrier (30) and the substrate (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to integrated circuits. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to integrated 
circuit carriers. Advances in integrated circuit technology continue to produce 
smaller and denser devices. As a result of such increased 
device density, the number of connections that may be made to 
an integrated circuit ("pin-out") has increased 
substantially, while the size of the integrated circuit has 
decreased substantially. Traditional approaches to 
integrated circuit packaging cannot accommodate these modern 
device pin-out densities. Accordingly, considerable effort 
is currently being expended to develop and improve integrated 
circuit packaging technologies.  One emerging packaging technology that is particularly 
promising is that of microcarriers. Fig. 1 is a partial plan 
view of a typical microcarrier 10, in which a carrier base 12 
includes rows of terminals 14 to which an integrated circuit 
(not shown) is connected. An array of bump-shaped pads 16 
provides a microcarrier pin-out. The microcarrier shown in 
Fig. 1 provides a microcarrier having a size of 2 cm (0.8 
inches) per side, and a pin-out of 408 pads having a 0.6 mm 
(24 mil) pitch. Microcarriers presently available are capable 
of providing a pin-out array of up to 1000 pads having a 0.25 
mm (10 mil) pitch. In early microcarrier applications, an integrated circuit 
was wire bonded to the microcarrier. The microcarrier was 
then mounted onto a substrate, such as a printed circuit 
board, using area array solder joints. In more recent 
microcarrier applications, the microcarrier may be designed 
to accept integrated circuits having either high density TAB 
or area array flip chip solder bump connections, in addition 
to wire bonds. Initially, microcarriers were made of alumina ceramics. Such 
microcarriers provided about 400 input/output terminals 
"I/O") in a package having dimensions of about 2.03 cm (0.8 
inches) per side. This compares quite favorably with other 
packaging technologies, such as pin grid arrays, which have 
dimensions of about 5.08 cm (2 inches) per side.  When first introduced, ceramic microcarriers were mounted 
onto multilayer ceramic substrates having matching pads by 
solder screen printing and IR reflow of the 
microcarrier/substrate assembly. Currently, microcarriers 
may be made of many different materials. For example, 
printed circuit board materials may be used for low cost 
applications having low to medium I/O count, whereas Cu/Pl on 
ceramic (such as alumina, aluminum
