<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a organic compound having pharmaceutical utility 
and to pharmaceutical formulations and their use in the treatment of disease 
conditions. More particularly, the present invention concerns a novel crystalline 
polymorph of 1-(4-amino-6,7-dimethoxy-2-quinazolinyl)-4-(2-tetrthydrofuroyl)piperazine 
monohydrochloride ("terazosin" hydrochloride) and to a soft 
elastic gelatin capsule formulation comprising terazosin hydrochloride and its use in 
the treatment of hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and congestive heart 
failure. The compound 1-(4-amino-6,7-dimethoxy-2-quinazolinyl)-4-(2-tetrahydrofuroyl)piperazine 
is known by the common name "terazosin" and is the 
subject of United States Patent 4,026,894. The compound is known to have utility 
for the treatment of hypertension ad benign prostatic hyperplasia, ad 
pharmaceutical compositions comprising terazosin and its salts are claimed in 
United States Patent 4,112,097. The dihydrate crystalline form of the hydrochloride 
salt of terazosin is disclosed and claimed in United States Patent 4,251,532, and is 
marketed under the trade name Hytrin®. The R(+)-enatiomer of terazosin is 
disclosed ad claimed in United States Patent 5,212,176. In the drawing:
