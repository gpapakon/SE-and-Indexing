<ABSTRACT>
An inflator comprising: a pressure vessel (10) for storing a quantity of stored inflation gas under pressure. The pressure vessel comprising a first burst disk (46) and a seal disk (310) both for selectively sealing same. The inflator (10) including a gas release mechanism (52, 300) for permitting the controlled, staged release of the inflation gas at determinable inflation rates. The gas release mechanism includes: a first pyrotechnic device, positioned outside of the pressure vessel and spaced from the first burst disk (46), including a piston (72) moved into a disk piercing position to rupture the first burst disk (46) in response to the buildup of pressure caused burning of a first quantity of propellant material (218). The bursting of the first burst disk permits the inflation gas to initially flow out of the pressure vessel at a determinable cold inflation rate, the piston thereafter provides a conduit to communicate the products of combustion of the burning propellent to the pressure means so as to increase the temperature of the inflation gas therein and thereby increase the rate of egress of the gas. The inflator (10) also includes a second pyrotechnic mechanism (300), positioned outside of the pressure vessel and spaced from the seal disk (310), for providing, when activated, additional products of combustion arising from burning of a second quantity of propellent material, the products of combustion opening the seal disk (310) and thereafter entering the pressure vessel to heat the inflation gas therein and thereby elevate the rate of egress of the inflation gas above the rate achievable by the first pyrotechnic device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an 
inflator for an air bag or cushion and more specifically 
to the type of inflator known as a hybrid inflator. It is known that if the early inflation rate of an 
air bag is too high, the resulting deployment forces can 
contribute to the possible injury of an occupant who is 
out of the normal seated (either driver or passenger) 
position. If, however, the air bag inflation rate is 
maintained at a relatively low value, primarily to reduce 
such deployment forces, full deployment of the air bag 
may not be timely achieved. It has for some time been appreciated that one goal 
of air bag inflator design is to provide an inflator 
which initially has a relatively low or soft inflation 
rate (for a relatively few milliseconds) primarily to 
protect the out-of-position passenger, such as a standing 
child, who would be subject to large deployment forces 
and thereafter to rapidly increase the inflation rate of 
the air bag to cause rapid and full inflation. United 
States Patent 3,758,131 illustrates one type of staged 
inflation device. The drawback of this inflator is that 
it utilizes three pyrotechnic elements. One element is 
used to open a burst disk to initiate inflation of an air 
bag by permitting inflation gas to exit in a cold 
unheated manner (cold inflation). Two other pyrotechnic  
 
elements are energized either simultaneously or 
sequentially to thereafter heat the stored inflation gas 
to provide increased, staged inflation or gas discharge 
rates of varying levels. In addition to the complexity 
of this design the cost of the inflator is prohibitive 
and also requires a three electronic activation circuits. 
The commonly owned United States Patent 5,022,674 
illustrates another type of hybrid inflator which using 
two pyrotechnic elements. This patent shows a 
means for achieving various levels of air bag inflation 
by energizing each pyrotechnic element. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an inflator which using two pyrotechnic heating 
elements and one which includes a cold inflation 
capability. The patent US 5022674 achieves a cold gas flow by opening 
a burst disk directly by the products of combustion of a closely spaced 
pyrotechnic element. Accordingly the invention comprises: an inflator 
comprising: a pressure vessel for storing a quantity of 
stored inflation gas under pressure. The pressure vessel 
means comprising a first burst disk and a seal disk both 
for selectively sealing same. The inflator including a 
gas

<CLAIMS>
An inflator (10) comprising: 

a pressure means (12, 14, 16, 20) for storing a 
quantity of inflation gas under pressure, the pressure 

means comprising a first burst disk (46) and a seal disk 
(310) both for selectively sealing the pressure means; 
gas release means (52, 300) for permitting the 
controlled, staged release of the inflation gas at 

determinable inflation rates, such gas release means 
including: 


first pyrotechnic means, positioned 
outside of the pressure means and spaced from the first 

burst disk (46), including a piston (72) moved into a 
disk piercing position to rupture the first burst disk 

(46) in response to the buildup of pressure caused 
burning of a first quantity of propellant material (218), 

the bursting of the first burst disk permitting the 
inflation gas to initially flow out of the pressure means 

at a determinable cold inflation rate, the piston 
thereafter providing a conduit to communicate the 

products of combustion of the burning propellent to the 
pressure means so as to increase the temperature of the 

inflation gas therein and thereby increase the rate of 
egress of the gas; 
second pyrotechnic means (300), positioned 
outside of the pressure means and spaced from the seal 

disk (310), for providing, when activated, additional 

products of combustion arising from burning of a second 
quantity of propellent material, the products of 

combustion opening the seal disk (310) and thereafter 
entering the pressure means to heat the inflation gas  

 
therein and thereby elevate the rate of egress of the 

inflation gas above the rate achievable by the first 
pyrotechnic means. 
The inflator as defined in Claim 1 wherein the first 
pyrotechnic means includes 


a hollow sliding piston (72) having an opening 
and including at one end thereof first means (74) for 

puncturing the first burst disk (46); 
a shear disk (80) having a stationary outer 
portion (87) and a central or inner portion (86), the 

central portion secured to one end of the piston (72) 
opposite the first means (74) and the central portion 

capable of separating from the outer portion and moving 
with the piston (72), the central portion functioning as 

a second burst disk; 
a propellant material (90) provided near the 
second burst disk (80), said propellant producing gaseous 

combustion products when burned; 
the piston being propelled into the first 
burst disk (46) after the central portion (86) of the 

shear disk separates from the outer portion in response 
to the build up of pressure generated due to the burning 

of a propellant (218), thereby permitting the egress of 
the stored inflation gas, the central portion (86) or 

second burst disk being ruptured by the continued build 
up of pressure due to the burning propellant material 

whereupon after the rupturing of the second burst disk 
the heated products of combustion resulting from the 

burning propellant material flow through the sliding 
piston (72) to increase the temperature of the stored 

inflation gas prior to its exit from the inflator. 
The inflator (10) as defined in Claim 1 wherein the 
volume of the pressure means, the pressure at which the 

inflation gas is stored, the first quantity of propellent 
material and the heat generated thereby are selected such 

that the volume of inflation gas communicated to a 
coacting air bag is sufficient to inflate the air bag to 

a partially full level during a vehicular accident above 
a threshold level and below a second level. 
The inflator (10) as defined in Claim 3 wherein the 
quantity of second propellent material and the heat 

generated thereby are selected such that the air bag is 
inflated to a more complete level during a vehicular 

accident of between the second level and a third level. 
The inflator as defined in Claim 4 wherein the 
threshold and second accident levels are each 

respectively in a range from approximately 10-18 and 
18-35 miles per hour (16 to 28.8 and 28.8 to 56 km/hr). 
The inflator (10) as defined in Claim 3 wherein the 
threshold level is chosen to correspond to the situations 

involving a statistically significant number of vehicle 
accidents.
