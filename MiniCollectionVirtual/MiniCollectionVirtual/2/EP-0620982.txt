<ABSTRACT>
Green, ripe vanilla pods (beans) are extracted to 
provide vanillin glycoside, which is used as a 

flavourising/aromatising agent in, for example, 
cigarettes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to the imparting of 
flavour and/or aroma properties to articles or substances. There have been made numerous proposals for the 
incorporation in smoking articles, cigarettes for example, 
of compounds which effect a modification in the sensory 
perception appertaining to the mainstream and/or the 
sidestream smoke of the smoking articles. An agent commonly proposed for use as a smoke 
modifying agent is vanillin. Vanillin may be obtained 
from cured vanilla pods (beans). In that vanillin is volatile, the application of 
vanillin simpliciter to the smoking material or other 
component of a smoking article is less than fully 
efficient. With a view to overcoming this problem, 
proposals have been made for the incorporation in smoking 
articles of synthetic, non-volatile or substantially non-volatile 
compounds which, during and as a result of the 
smoking conditions, yield vanillin or a vanillic or 
related substance. Examples of this approach are 
disclosed in the following patent specifications: EP 413 
162, EP 461 872, EP 470 766, EP 503 795, EP 506 231, EP 
510 817, EP 514 202, WO 88/09133 and WO 92/10107. US 4,941,486 to Duke et al describes a smoking 
article comprising a flavour precursor such as synthesised 
ethyl vanillin glucoside. The flavour precursor provides 
no substantial aroma to the cigarette prior to use, but  
 
releases the flavour during use. The flavour precursor 
may be applied to the smoking article wrapper. 
Alternatively, the flavour precursor may be incorporated 
into the filter element in the form of a flavoured pellet. It is also known to incorporate in smoking materials 
glycosides of tobacco or Stevia rebaudiana origin. See, 
for example, EP 154 235 and GB 1,508,616. The subject invention provides a method of modifying 
a smoking article, wherein vanillin glycoside is 
incorporated in a smoking article, said vanillin glycoside 
being of natural origin. The subject invention further provides a smoking 
article, which article 
comprises vanillin glycoside of natural origin. The term "vanillin glycoside of natural origin" is 
used herein to mean that the vanillin glycoside derives 
from a natural source, uncured pods of a vanilla plant 
(Vanilla plansfolia) for example, in which it exists as 
vanillin glycoside, as opposed to it being vanillin 
glycoside made by artificial synthesis. In accordance with the subject invention the vanillin 
glycoside may be incorporated with one or more of: smoking 
material, wrapping material, filter material and

<CLAIMS>
A method of modifying a smoking article, wherein 
vanillin glycoside is incorporated in a smoking 

article, said vanillin glycoside being of natural 
origin. 
A method according to Claim 1, wherein said vanillin 
glycoside is a product of extraction of vanilla pods. 
A smoking article or a smoking material, a wrapping material, 
a filter material, a wrapper adhesive, which 

article, material or adhesive comprises vanillin glycoside of 
natural origin. 
A smoking article or a smoking material, a wrapping material, 
a filter material, a wrapper adhesive according 

to Claim 3, wherein said vanillin glycoside is a 
product of extraction of vanilla pods.
