<ABSTRACT>
A monolithically integrated electroabsorption 
modulator/optical amplifier is described which is prepared 

using a lateral bandgap control technique with a planar 
III-V compund semiconductor substrate. The described 

device evidences a bandgap shift in excess of 60 
nanometers, so indicating its applicability for 

integration of modulators and lasers or amplifiers. The 
device is fabricated by atmospheric pressure metal organic 

condensed vapor deposition growth of gallium indium 
arsenise/gallium indium aresenide phosphide strained 

quantum wells on ridges deposited on the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to monolithically integrated 
devices and to a method for the preparation thereof. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to 
monolithically integrated DFB or DRB 
laser/electroabsorption modulator light sources prepared 
by the use of metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) on 
non-planar semiconductor substrates. During the past decade, there has been a birth of 
interest in a class of devices commonly referred to as 
monolithically integrated modulators with distributed 
feedback (DFB) lasers or distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) 
lasers. This spark of interest has been attributed to the 
fact that these structures evidence low wavelength chirp 
characteristics which are of particular interest for use 
in high speed lightwave communication systems. Heretofore, in the fabrication of such devices, it 
has been the practice of workers in the art to integrate 
modulators with active elements such as lasers or 
amplifiers by the use of either butt joint couplings or 
selective area epitaxy. The butt joint coupling technique 
is limited in that epitaxial growth required for 
fabrication of the device of interest must be effected in  
 
more than one procedural steps. Unfortunately, this type of processing ofttimes 
results in the introduction of rough interfaces on the surface of the structure, 
particularly at those sites where it is desirable to effect joinder of the laser with the 
modulator. This typically leads to the deleterious scattering of light in the finished 
device. Efforts to alleviate this difficulty focused upon the use of a technique 
commonly referred to as selective area epitaxy. In this process, a dielectric layer in 
the form of a thin film is deposited on the surface of the substrate prior to effecting 
growth of an epitaxial layer. This dielectric layer, which typically comprises silicon 
dioxide, also tends to introduce roughness upon the surface of the substrate and, 
more importantly, leads to the formation of a polycrystalline film grown on the 
surface of the dielectric which may interfere with further processing. Accordingly, 
workers in the art have continued their search for new techniques designed to 
eliminate the prior art deficiencies. IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, vol. 27, no. 6, 
June 1991, pages 1470-1475 discloses a monolithically 
integrated laser-electroabsorption modulator light 
source grown in a single step. Both the laser and the 
modulator are grown on the same ridge. Fourth International Conference on Indium Phosphide
