<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a holographic display for the holographic representation of three-dimensional images for use in CAD systems in the fields of computer vision, virtual reality and computer games, in medical technology as CT output as a head-up display and in other fields. Sufficiently coherent light is phase and/or amplitude modulated in each cell of the information substrate and radiated pointwise and hence at a wide angle. The light spots are distributed on a surface at irregular intervals, the optical allocation to the individual cells being maintained. A 3D image is generated which can be observed at a wide angle. The regularity of the cell arrangement in the information substrate is largely maintained. Hence image superimpositions caused by periodicity are suppressed within the angle of observation.

Holographic display for producing three-dimensional images, comprising

a light source,
with an inforrnation carrier (1) located in the illumination beam of the light source (2),
whose cells (2) have individually controllable transmission characteristics for the modulation

of the illumination beam with the information of the holographic image to be produced,
characterized in that
each cell (2) of the information carrier (1) is associated with an element (4), as the
apertures of a perforated mask (3) or as a lens mask, which produces light points

through a deflection mask (7) onto a surface (8), which radiates light transmitted by the
associated cell (2) in the manner of a point light source with a large angle, so that the image

is visible under large angles of observation,

and in that the elements (4) are distributed over the surface of the information carrier at
unequal distances apart so that practically no periodicity occurs within the angle of observation.
Holographic display as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the information carrier
(1) is associated with a perforated mask (3) with point apertures (4) and the positions

of most of the apertures (4) in the perforated mask (3) irregularly deviate from the
central position of their associated cells (2), their optical assignment to their cells (2) being

preserved. 
Holographic display as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the information
carrier (1) is associated with a lens mask (6) with focussing elements in a cell configuration

whose focal points lie on a surface (8) at unequal distances apart.
Holographic display as claimed in Claims 2 and 3, 
characterized in that
 the focal
points of the focussing and deflecting elements lie in the point apertures (4) of the aperture

mask (3).
Holographic display as claimed in Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 between the lens
mask (6) and the surface (8) in which the focal points of the focussing and deflecting elements

lie a deflection mask (7) is arranged with elements deflecting or aligning the optical
axes of the focussing cones about parallel to the image normal.
Holographic display as claimed in Claims 3 or/and 5, 
characterized in that
 the focussing
or/and deflecting elements are holographic optical elements.
Holographic display as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the aperture mask
(3) is associated with an amplitude mask (5) with apertures controlling the light intensity.
Holographic display as claimed in Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the focussing elements
are arranged in a microlens array.
