<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a high-pressure proportioning system in a high-pressure/low-pressure fire extinguishing pump system for extinguishing and cooling purposes, which system provides a supply of foam independent of low-pressure pumping. As a result, the cooling effect of the low-pressure pump is improved and the inaccuracies in the dosing of foam which arise from the hydrant pressure are eliminated. It is proposed according to the invention to provide in the high-pressure delivery line (9) a flow monitor (15) or flow meter (33) in addition to a temperature sensor (10) for the purpose of measuring temperature and flow. Automatically via a preferably pneumatic control device (20) for thermal relief (unloading) (20), a high-pressure pump is cooled by the output signals of the devices, and it is ensured that the driving water and the feeding of foam are shut off or stepless metering (23) is ensured, in order to achieve no overfoaming or an optimum proportioning. A further advantage consists in that this system can equally be used for the low-pressure pumping range.
