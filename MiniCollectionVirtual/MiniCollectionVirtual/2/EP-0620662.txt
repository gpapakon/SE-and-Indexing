<ABSTRACT>
The processing, serializing and synchronizing 
device includes a processing means (P) which is able to 

process a plurality of digital signals at a clock frequency 
f and is reset by a first reset signal (R1), a serializing 

and synchronizing circuit (S) which multiplexes the digital 
signals and generates a signal (OUT) synchronous with a clock 

signal (CLK) with frequency 4f and is reset by the second 
reset signal (R3), and a control circuit (C) which generates 

from the latter clock signal (CLK) and from a second reset 
signal (R2), a clock signal (CLK4BUF) with frequency f and 

controlling the processing means (P), and the first reset 
signal (R1) as well as a second reset signal (R3), the latter 

reset signal being used to reset the serializing and 
synchronizing circuit (S). The phase relation between the 

clock signals and the reset signals is such that signals (I0-I3) 
provided by the processing means (P) are stable when 

being applied to the serializing and synchronizing circuit 
(S), i.e. that the latter signals are not multiplexed at 

their value transitions. Moreover, thanks to the control of 
the delay circuit by both the first and the second clock 

signal, the multiplexing instants are independent of the 
relative phase shift of the clock signals provided that the 

latter shift is theoretically larger than 0 and smaller than 
3 clock periods of the first mentioned clock signal (CLK).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a processing, 
serializing and synchronizing device including a processing 
means able to process a plurality of digital signals under 
control of a first clock signal and to be reset by a first 
reset signal, a serializing and synchronizing circuit able to 
be reset by a second reset signal and including a 
multiplexing device to convert the thus processed plurality 
of digital signals to a serialized output signal synchronous 
with a second clock signal, and a control circuit generating 
said first and second clock signals. Such a device is for instance used in a 
telecommunication system to process an incoming data stream 
at a lower rate than its input rate and to derive from the 
thus processed stream an output data stream at an output rate 
equal or even higher than the input rate. More particularly 
the processing means for instance demultiplexes the incoming 
data stream to provide the plurality of digital signals which 
can then be processed at a lower rate than the input rate, 
i.e. at the rate of the first clock signal, and the 
serializing and synchronizing circuit multiplexes the 
processed digital signals at the rate of the second clock 
signal which is at least equal to the input rate. When the first reset signal is independent from the 
the second one and from the clock signals and when the 
serializing and synchronizing circuit operates without 
knowledge of the phase relationship between both the clock 
signals, it may happen that the processed digital signals 
supplied to the multiplexing device are undefined because the 
serializing and synchronizing circuit is for instance reset 
while the processing means is still supplying undefined data, 
or that the multiplexing of the processed digital signals 
occurs at transitions thereof. The latter situation can 
happen at start up or after a not known interval of time due 
to a shift of the first clock with respect to the second one 
because of , e.g., temperature variations. The processed  
 
digital signals have then to be synchronized for instance by 
a relative phase shift of the first clock with respect to the 
incoming signal, resulting in a possible value jump of the 
output data, i.e. a skipping of output data bits. Moreover, 
such a possible jump makes testing of the device rather 
difficult since the output signal can then not be uniquely 
defined with respect to the input signal because the instant 
at which the jump occurs is unknown. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
processing
