<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for manufacturing a strip of 
ply or belt stock reinforced with steel monofilaments fed 

from a plurality of reels (60,60',60'') mounted on the 

spindles (54) of a reel support structure (18). The article 
of manufacture which results from the method is a uniform 

strip of reinforced ply or belt stock of higher epi, smaller 
gauge and fewer splices than possible with prior method and 

apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
While the invention is subject to a wide range of
applications, it is particularly related to the method and
apparatus for manufacturing ply or belt stock. More
particularly, the present invention is directed to a method
and apparatus for manufacturing ply or belt stock of rubber
or elastomeric material used in the production of tires,
wherein the ply or belt stock is internally reinforced with
more than 12 ends per cm (epc) [30 ends per inch (epi)] of metal monofilaments or
cords.Conventionally, radial pneumatic tires for use in
passenger car and light truck applications have steel cords
embedded in the carcass ply forming the tires. These cords
are formed of steel filaments which are woven together and
act to increase the strength of the carcass ply. The steel
cords are oriented transversely or else obliquely with
respect to a major dimension of the ply itself. For reasons
of production economy, these plies are obtained by starting
with a continuous work piece in which the metal cords
constitute a kind of metal warp. This work piece is
subsequently reduced, by means of transverse or oblique
cuts, into a plurality of segments which are then positioned
along-side one another and spliced together along the
adjacent edges to form the plies.Such a method of the prior art is herein explained by 
referring to Fig. 1. Wire cords 10 are wound about reels 12
which are individually, rotatably supported on spindles 13
that project outward from oppositely facing surfaces 14 and
16 of a reel support structure 18. The cords 10 are paid
out toward a guide plate 20. The guide plate 20 is formed
with a number of small, equally spaced apertures arranged in
three rows spaced from each other. The cords 10 pass
through the apertures in each of the rows to be arranged in
three planes which intersect at the bite of a first pair of
cylindrical guide rollers 22 through which the cords 10 are
then introduced. The cords 10 emerge in an horizontal plane
and are next introduced through a second pair of cylindrical
guide rollers 24 to insure the stable feeding of the cords
into an extruder 26. The cords are then covered between two
sheets 28 and 30 of rubber or an elastomeric material and
pressed in extruder 26 to form a length of reinforced
carcass ply 32 used in the production of tires.Next, as illustrated in Fig. 5, the length of
spliceless ply 32 is reduced, by means of a transverse cut,
into a plurality of segments 34 which are carried by a
conveyor device 36 to a position along-side another segment
and then spliced together

<CLAIMS>
A method of covering the steel monofilaments or
cords (52) with rubber or elastomer for the manufacture

of a strip of ply or belt stock reinforced with steel
monofilaments or cords adapted for use in a tire,

comprising the steps of:

a. feeding a plurality of said steel monofilaments
or cords from a plurality of reels (60, 60', 60'')

freely rotatably mounted on spindles (54) secured at
an inner end to a reel support structure (50) so

that said plurality of said reels (60, 60', 60'') are
movably mounted on each of said spindles in an axial

direction;
b. applying an independent axial braking force to
outwardly facing sides of an adjacent one of said

plurality of reels (60,60',60'') whereby said steel
monofilaments or cords are fed from each of said

plurality of reels (60, 60', 60'') at a uniform
tension;
c. aligning said steel monofilaments or cords in a
predetermined spaced relationship one to another;
d. arranging said steel monofilaments or cords in
a horizontal plane;
e. covering said steel monofilaments or cords in a
horizontal plane with rubber or elastomer; and
f. pressing said covered steel monofilaments or
cords to form a length of reinforced spliceless ply

or belt stock (32) adapted for use in the production
of tires.
The method as defined in claim 1 including the
step of feeding said steel monofilaments or cords (52)

from each of said reels (60, 60' 60'') mounted on each of
said spindles in opposite directions from that of an 

adjacent reel.
The method as defined in any of claims 1 and 2
further including the steps of:


cutting said length of spliceless ply or belt
stock into a plurality of spliceless ply or belt stock

segments;
moving a cut one of said cut spliceless ply or
belt stock segments to a position along-side a prior cut

one of said spliceless ply or belt stock segments; and
splicing together said spliceless ply or belt
stock segments positioned along-side each other to form a

length of reinforced spliced ply or belt stock moving in
a direction of travel whereby said monofilaments or cords

are arranged transverse to the direction of travel of
said length of spliced ply or belt stock.
The method as defined in claim 3 wherein said
step of aligning said steel monofilaments or cords (52)

in a predetermined spaced relationship one to the other
includes the step of passing said steel monofilaments or

cords fed from said reels (60, 60' 60'') on each of said
spindles through a guide plate (20).
The method as defined in claim 4 wherein said
step of arranging said plurality of steel monofilaments

or cords (52) in a horizontal plane includes the step of
passing said steel monofilaments or cords, subsequent to

said step of aligning, through a pair of cylindrical
guide rollers (22).
An apparatus for feeding wire (52) during the
manufacture of reinforced ply or belt stock, including:


a spindle (54) secured at an inner end to a
reel support structure (50), said spindle having a collar

(78) located near said inner end;
a plurality of reels (60, 60' 60'') having said 
wire wound thereabout, said reels (60, 60' 60'') being

rotatably mounted on said spindle;
a first friction disk (71) mounted on said
spindle and abutted against said collar (78);
a first of said plurality of reels (60'')
abutted against said first friction disk (71);
one or more spring biased friction assemblies
(62) mounted on said spindle and disposed between each of

said plurality of reels (60, 60' 60'') located adjacent to
each other for applying an axial braking force to each of

said plurality of reels (60, 60' 60'');
a second friction disk (69) mounted on said
spindle and abutted against a second of said plurality of

reels (60) located adjacent an outer free end of said
spindle; and
a retaining device (70) at said free end of
said spindle abutting against said second friction disk

(69) for securing said plurality of reels (60, 60' 60'')
on said spindle and compressing said one or more spring

biased friction assemblies (62) whereby said axial

braking force is applied independently to each of said
plurality of reels (60, 60' 60'') and said wire (52) is

fed from each of said plurality of reels (60, 60' 60'')
with a uniform tension.
The apparatus of claim 6 further including a
third of said plurality of reels (60') mounted on said

spindle between said first (60'') and second (60) of said
plurality of reels (60, 60' 60'').
The apparatus of claims 6 and 7 wherein each of
said one or more spring biased friction assemblies (62)
