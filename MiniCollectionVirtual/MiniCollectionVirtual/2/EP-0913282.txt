<ABSTRACT>
A heat pump type air conditioning system (A) for air-conditioning
a passenger compartment of an automotive vehicle. The

air conditioning system comprises first and second units (10, 20).
The first unit includes a heater core (12) and a first evaporator (13)

while the second unit includes a second condenser (22) and a second
evaporator (23). A compressor (2) and a first condenser (3) are

disposed outside the first and second units which constitute a
refrigeration cycle including the first evaporator (13). A circuit

change-over valve (4) is provided to cause flow of the refrigerant
discharged from the compressor (2) to be changed over between a

refrigeration operation refrigerant circuit including the first
condenser and a heating operation refrigerant circuit including a

bypass passage for allowing the refrigerant to flow bypassing the
first condenser. A third evaporator (30) is disposed outside the first

and second units (10, 20). A flow control valve (31) is provided to
control a flow amount of the engine coolant circulating through the

third evaporator (30) in accordance with a thermal load condition of
the vehicle under control of an opening degree of the flow control

valve, during the heating operation of the air conditioning system.
The flow control valve (31) is set to take its fully closed state to

prevent the engine coolant from circulating through the third
evaporator (30) when a discharge pressure of the compressor (2)

rises to a level not lower a first set value which is lower than a
standard value to stop an operation of the compressor, and to take

its fully opened state to allow the engine coolant to circulate through
the third evaporator (30) when the discharge pressure of the

compressor (2) lowers to a level not higher than a second set value
which is lower than the first set value.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in a heat pump
type air conditioning system for an automotive vehicle in which a
passenger compartment can be heated and refrigerated under the
action of engine coolant and refrigerant, and more particularly to the
improvements to prevent a compressor from its damage upon an
excessive rise in discharge pressure.In recent years, a part of high quality cars and so-called
one box-type cars having a relatively large space of a passenger
compartment are recently equipped with an automotive air
conditioning system of a so-called dual air conditioning type
including a front unit for air-conditioning a front region (for example,
a front seat part) of the passenger compartment and a rear unit for
air-conditioning a rear region (for example, a rear seat part) of the
passenger compartment. Accordingly, the front and rear regions of
the passenger compartment can be independently air-conditioned so
as to achieve a comfortable air conditioning for the passenger
compartment.A typical example of the automotive air conditioning
systems of such a type is arranged as follows: During the heating
operation of the air conditioning system, the front unit uses engine
coolant as a heat source while the rear unit uses as a heat source a
high temperature and pressure refrigerant which is compressed by a
compressor. Such an air conditioning system is arranged to pump up
heat from the low temperature outside air in the circulating process
or refrigeration cycle of the refrigerant and uses it to heat the
passenger compartment. Accordingly, this air conditioning system is
called a "heat pump type air conditioning system". However, drawbacks have encountered in such air
conditioning system in case of carrying out the heating operation of
the passenger compartment of the automotive vehicle. For example,
when the temperature of the outside air is low, for example, in the
morning in winter, the temperature of the engine coolant is low at
the engine starting, and the temperature rise of the refrigerant is
not sharp. Consequently, it is difficult to put the air conditioning
system into such a state as to blow warm air into the passenger
compartment simultaneously with the starting of operation of the
air conditioning system, so that the air conditioning system is low in
quick or instant heating ability and is low in heating performance.
Particularly in the one-box type cars which provided with a diesel
engine and are large in space of the passenger compartment, the
rate of temperature rise of the
