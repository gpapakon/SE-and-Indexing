<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic ablation device for effecting ultrasonic ablation of intravascular obstructions such as plaque or thrombi. The ultrasonic ablation device has a) an elongate catheter body (12), b) a wave guide or ultrasound transmission wire (20) extending through the elongate catheter body (12), and c) a distal head or probe member (22) positioned at the distal end of the catheter body. A guidewire lumen or passageway (14) extends longitudinally through the catheter body (12) and a guidewire aperture or passageway (60) extends through the distal head or probe (22) such that a guidewire (34) may be passed through the distal head or probe (22) and through the catheter body (12). Also disclosed is an improved distal head or probe which may be incorporated in any elongate ultrasonic ablation device, the improvement comprising the formation of a concavity or indentation in the distal or frontal face (23) of the distal head or probe (22) to improve the cavitation created thereby.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to medical equipment
and more particularly to an improved ultrasonic ablation
device for effecting ultrasonic ablation of intravascular
obstructions.The use of ultrasonic energy to ablate obstructions
within blood vessels has been proposed as a viable
alternative to the commonly performed "balloon"
angioplasty procedures wherein the occlusive lesion is
dilated or compressed by inflation of a transluminally
inserted balloon. Ultrasonic ablation may also be used
to ablate thrombus within blood vessels.Methods and apparatus for effecting ultrasonic
ablation have been described in the prior art. One type
of ultrasonic ablation apparatus known in the prior art
comprises a flexible intravascular catheter having an
ultrasound transmission wire or waveguide which extends
longitudinally therethrough. A probe tip or distal head 
is formed on the distal end of the ultrasound
transmission wire or waveguide. Such probe or distal
head may protrude beyond the distal tip of the catheter.
The proximal end of the transmission wire or waveguide is
connected to an ultrasound generator. Sonic energy is
thereby transmitted through the transmission wire causing
the distal head or probe of the device to undergo
vibratory movement. Such vibratory movement of the
distal head or probe has been demonstrated to cause
ablation of vaso-occlusive atherosclerotic lesions
without damaging or perforating the surrounding blood
vessel wall.Examples of ultrasonic ablation devices and related
apparatus used in the performance of ultrasonic
angioplasty devices include those described in United
States Patent Nos. 3,433,226 (Boyd), 3,823,717 (Pohlman
et al.), 4,808,153 (Parisi), 4,936,281 (Stasz), 3,565,062
(Kuris), 4,924,863 (Sterzer), 4,870,953 (DonMichael et
al.); and other Patent Publications WO87-05739 (Cooper),
WO89-06515 (Bernstein et al.), WO90-0130, (Sonic Needle
Corp.); EP 316,789 (DonMichael, et al.); DE 3,812,836
(Schubert) and DE 2,438,648 (Pohlman).The efficacy of any intravascular ultrasonic
ablation procedure is inherently dependent upon the
ability of the operator to position the ultrasonic
ablation device in close spaced relation to occlusive
plaque or thrombus so that the ultrasonic energy of the 
device may successfully ablate the occlusive plaque or
thrombus.One means of facilitating proper advancement and
positioning of the ultrasound ablation device or catheter
is to initially insert and advance a flexible,
radiographically visible, guidewire through the
vasculature to a point where the
