<ABSTRACT>
A securing hole (12) in fittings (10), especially metal furniture fittings, in which a securing screw with a countersunk head (16) and, a threaded shank with a predetermined outside thread diameter can be pre-fitted, in which the securing hole (12) has a chamfer (18) matching the countersunk head (16) of the securing screw and adjacent thereto a substantially cylindrical section (20) for the shank of the screw. The inner diameter of the cylindrical section (20) is slightly smaller than the outside diameter of the shank of the securing screw (14) measured over the threads and a counter-thread (24) to take the thread of the threaded shank is made in the cylindrical section, the length of which measured in the screwing direction is shorter than the threadless shank section (28) of the securing screw (14) beneath the countersunk head (16).

<CLAIMS>
Method of producing a fastening bore (12), provided with a
complementary screw thread (24), in a fitting (10) of thin metal plate,

particularly a furniture fitting, in which a threaded section (22) of the
shaft of a fastening screw provided with a frusto-conical flat head (16)

may be pre-installed, the shaft of which has an unthreaded section (28)
between the threaded section (22) and the flat head (16), 
characterised in
that
 a bore of small diameter is firstly stamped in a flat metal plate blank
of the fitting (10) in the region of the fastening bore (12) to be produced

and the region of the metal plate adjacent to the bore is then pressed up
to form a cylindrical projection (30) projecting from the surface of the

metal plate blank, the free internal diameter of which is substantially
equal to the free internal diameter of a subsequent cylindrical bore

section (20), which for its part is somewhat smaller than the external
diameter of the screw shaft measured over the threads of the fastening

screw (40), and that at least a proportion of the portion of the cylindrical
projection (30) projecting beyond the surface of the metal plate blank is

expanded to the frusto-conical shape complementary to the head of the
fastening screw (14) by means of a die with conical pressing surfaces

forced into its interior, whereafter finally the complimentary thread (24)
is worked into the remaining cylindrical bore section (20) with a length

in the insertion direction which is shorter than the adjoining unthreaded
shaft section of the fastened screw below the flat head. 
Method as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the complementary
thread (24) is worked into the cylindrical bore section (20) in a non-cutting

manner.
Method as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the compleentary
thread (24) is cut into the cylindrical bore section (20).
