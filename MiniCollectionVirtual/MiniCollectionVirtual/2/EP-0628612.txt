<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention deals with preparing compositions as
dispersions for use in aqueous and non-aqueous media.It is known that dispersions comprising a non-polar organic liquid,
an alkaline earth metal salt of a fatty acid or substituted fatty acid,
and a dispersant effective as a rheology modifier for imparting plastic
flow to printing inks may be obtained. The foregoing disclosure is found
in United States Patent 3,819,386 issued June 25, 1974 to Higgins et al.
The Higgins et al patent further describes the dispersant as being
characterized by having at least one acyl, acyloxy or acylimidoyl group
wherein the dispersant is typically derived from a carboxylic acid having
at least about 50 carbon atoms and at least one radical containing a
nitrogen or oxygen atom connecting the acid-derived group to a
hydrocarbon or substituted hydrocarbon radical.Quinn, in United States Patent 4,642,330 issued February 10, 1987
describes dispersant salt compositions made by reacting a phosphorous-free
carboxylic solubilizer with sulfonic acid-free organic acids or
mineral acids. The carboxylic solubilizer is described as being made by
the reaction of a polycarboxylic acid acylating agent having at least one
hydrocarbon-based substituent of at least 8 to 500 carbon atoms with at
least one poly(alkyleneamine). The dispersant salts have good thermal
stability when mixed with a surfactant or hydrophilic organic solvent.
The compositions are stated to be useful with aqueous solutions to
disperse various fillers including carbon black, as well as to solubilize
various fluids.Forsberg, in United States patent 4,448,703 issued May 15, 1984
describes combinations of carboxylic solubilizers made by reacting an
acylating agent with an N-(hydroxyl-substituted hydrocarbyl) amine and
surfactants which are useful in incorporating 
oil-soluble, water-insoluble functional additives into
aqueous systems. In particular, the Forsberg patent describes
formulating into compositions anti-wear, extreme pressure and
load-carrying agents such as dithiophosphates into a water-based
hydraulic fluid.United States patent 5,034,508 issued July 28, 1991 to
Shiga et al describes dispersants for non-aqueous systems and
particular materials which can disperse insoluble fine powders
in non-aqueous liquids in a short period of time and give long-term
dispersions stability. The Shiga patent describes
avoiding the formation of a so-called hard cake. The dispersant
of Shiga consists essentially of a polyether compound
derived from the class consisting of
