A device is disclosed for treating liquid-containing, crushable waste, in particular for treating hospital waste. In order to treat waste in a simple, hygienic and technically economic manner, the device has feeding means (1) in which the waste is introduced, crushing means (2) arranged downstream of the feeding means (1), screening means (3) arranged downstream of the crushing means (2), in order to collect most solid materials and a drip container (4) arranged substantially below the screening means (3) for collecting the liquid. The screening means (3) and possibly the drip container (4) can be removed in order to be emptied.
