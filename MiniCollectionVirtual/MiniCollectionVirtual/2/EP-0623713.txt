<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method and a device for obtaining automatic 
circulation in waste water pump stations. 
On the pressure side the pump unit is provided with a valve (6) 
which during certain periods opens a connection between the pump 

and the pump station, thus obtaining a circulation in the latter. 
The valve (6) is opened and closed by a valve ball (10) which is 

controlled by the pump pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a device for providing circulation in pump
stations which are parts of a municipal sewage system.As is described in the Swedish Patent Application 7908743-3 sludge
banks occur in pump stations and other tanks in a sewage system as
the circulation is not good enough. Sludge banks mean a lot of
problems such as a bad smell, risk for explosions, corrosion problems
etc.According to the Patent Application mentioned, the problems have
been solved by arranging a valve in the pump outlet, which is
opened temporarily thus obtaining a circulation and flushing in
the pump station. The sludge banks are dissolved and the fluid is
homogenized.The adjustment of the valve has up to now been controlled by
electric means by help of a linear motor which acts upon a slide
in the valve. A disadvantage with this solution, in addition to a
relatively high cost, is that it easily becomes clogged as the
pumped medium normally contains large amounts of solid bodies such
as stones, rags and other objects. If a stone is stuck in the valve
slide, the electric motor may break down.Another disadvantage is that the motor of the valve is electrically
driven which means specific installation problems where explosive
gas may occur. Another way to solve the problem to control the valve by help of the pump pressure
is shown in Swedish Pat No 8900597-9 and EP - A - 0 472 509. Here the under
pressure created by the flow through the valve is utilized to move a valve element
into a closed position after a certain time. This solution has however the
disadvantage that the under pressure is not always sufficiently strong to be able to
move the element into closed position. The purpose of this invention is to obtain a device which in a
simple and reliable way controls the valve, independent of the
pressure situation in the surrounding area. This is obtained by
help of the method and the device stated in the claims.The invention is described more closely below with reference to the
enclosed drawings.Fig 1 shows a pump station with a pump unit and attached valve.
Figs 2 to 4 show the principle design of the valve in different
operating positions.In the drawings 1 stands for a pump station with a submersible
pump unit 2 connected to a pressure pipe 3. 4 stands for the pump
housing having an inlet 5, while 6 stands for a mixing valve mounted
on the pump housing 4. 7 stands for a valve housing and 8 its
outlet with a bend 9. 10 stands for a valve ball and 11 its seat.
12 and 13 stand for diaphragms, 14 and 15 cups, 16 a conduit,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method to control a valve for obtaining circulation in sewage water pump stations
containing one or several pump units, preferably centrifugal pumps of the

submersible type, one or several provided with mixing valves, which automatically,
during a certain limited time period (periods) connect the pressure side of a pump

with the pump station thus obtaining a circulation of the pumped medium and where
the alternate return connection to the pump station is carried out by help of a valve

comprising a valve housing connected to the pressure side of the pump and an
outlet nozzle, the control of the valve being obtained by help of a movable valve

element (10) which, in dependence of the pressure situation in the valve, in its one
rest position seals against a seat (11) in the valve housing (7) thus closing the latter

and which in its other rest position is contained within a diaphragm (12) arranged
outside the flow through the valve, characterized in that the valve element (10) is

acted upon to move from its first to its second rest position by gravity and from its
second to its first rest position by the pressure difference between the outlet part (8),

higher pressure, and the inner of the valve housing (7), lower pressure, caused by
the flow through the valve,the pressure in outlet part (8) acting upon two separate

diaphragms (12) and (13).
A device for carrying out the method according to claim 1, characterized in that it
comprises a valve housing (7) with an outlet part (8), the inner of the housing (7) as

well as the inner of the outlet part (8) being provided with one diaphragm each (12)
and (13) respectively, which delimit rooms (14) and (15) respectively communicating

via a conduit (16) and that the diaphragm (12) is arranged to be able to move the
valve element (10) in a closing direction towards a seat (11) in the valve housing (7)

thus interrupting the flow there through. 
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that a controlling device (17) is
arranged to control the flow through the conduit (16) which in its turn determines the

closing time for the valve.
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that the outlet part (8) is provided with
an interior shoulder (18) which adds to the pressure increase within the outlet part

(8),
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that the outlet part (8) is terminated
by a bend (9) which directs the flow from the valve and also adds to the pressure

increase within the outlet part (9).
