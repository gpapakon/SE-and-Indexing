<ABSTRACT>
A photographic film developing apparatus (1) includes 
a developing section (D) including a developing tank for 

developing a photographic film strip, a drying section (K) 
drying the developed film strip, and a film 

collecting/storing holder (5) disposed adjacent an exit of 
the drying section for collecting and storing the 

dried film strip from the drying section. The film 
collecting/storing holder (5) includes a film rolling 

device for rolling the film strip for the storage 
thereof within the holder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photographic
film developing apparatus.According to a photographic film developing
apparatus developed by the prior art, a film retrieved
from a cartridge is caused to pass, in succession, a
plurality of independent developing tanks and then the
developed film is dried for storage.Further, the dried developed film is temporarily
stored within a storage container commonly referred to
as a film stocker having a capacity sufficient for
preventing the stored film from being damaged through
physical contact. In this, the film is kept stored
under a naturally warped state thereof until the film
is withdrawn therefrom for a next processing step.For the next process, the warped film strip is
stretched straight and withdrawn under this state from 
the stocker to be subsequently conveyed to a site of
the next process.Therefore, the above-described convention requres
a relatively large space for the temporary storage of
the film. Further, since the film has to be once taken
out of the film stocker to be conveyed to the next
processing location, the transit operation of the film
is time consuming. In these respects, the conventional
art has room for improvement.In EP-0 502 665 however, is disclosed a
photographic film developing apparatus with a film
collecting/storing holder designed as an open spool.
Although this facilitates to handle the film the film
can still be damaged by physical contact.From US-A-3 507 195 is known a further film
collecting/storing holder, but this is not especially
designed for retrieving the film back from it at a
subsequent processing location.The present invention addresses to the above-described
inconveniences. A primary object of the
invention is to provide an improved developing
apparatus of the above type which is capable of storing
a dried developed film strip within a minimum space
which facilitates the transportation of the film to a
subsequent processing location thus achieving
improvement in overall operation efficiency. For fulfilling the above-identified objects, a
photographic film developing apparatus, according to
the present invention, comprises the features as
defined in claim 1.According to the construction as defined in claim
1, a developed and dried film strip is rolled by the
film rolling means to be stored within the holder, such
that the film under the rolled state may be stored in a
compact manner within the holder.According to the invention, the film
collecting/storing holder is detachable from the
apparatus body. As the film
