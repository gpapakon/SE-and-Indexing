<ABSTRACT>
In the production of an anti-copy film serving to cover documents (1) to prevent copying, opaque, strip-like covers (3) are applied to the individual layers of a transparent, multi-layer film (2) in a mutually offset arrangement for the printing process in such a way that the film appears to be opaque when viewed from above (4) but transparent when viewed obliquely (5). For this purpose, a web of film is printed with the covers in sections corresponding to the layers and the sections are subsequently folded relative to the layers.

A process for the production of an anticopy film, 
in which opaque, strip-like coverings (S1, S2) are 

applied by printing to both sides of the first layer of 
a transparent, multilayer film (2) in a regularly repeating 

manner and offset to one another in a defined manner, 
and similar coverings (S3) are applied by printing to the 

underside of at least one second layer, offset to the 
first coverings in a defined manner, wherein the 

coverings (S1-S3) are applied to a single film web (6) in 
the arrangements offset in a defined manner in adjacent 

or successive sections (I, II) conforming to the individual 
layers, the film web is then separated into the 

individual anticopy film formats, and the individual 
formats are folded along the section lines (7) in the 

layers of the anticopy film, it also being possible for 

the separation and folding to be carried out in the 
reverse sequence. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
coverings (S1-S3) are applied simultaneously to the film 

web (16) in a print run in the arrangements offset in a 
defined manner. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein, 
before the layers of the film (2) are folded onto one 

another, adhesive is applied to in each case at least one 
of the sides coming into contact, and a protective 

coating which protects against mechanical or chemical 
influences or prevents light reflection is applied to the 

other sides. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the coverings (S1-S3) are applied to a film which  

 
has been rendered matt and reduces light reflection on at 

least one side. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein radiation-curing printing inks which minimize 

geometrical changes during drying are used for the 
coverings (S1-S3). 
An anticopy film, in which opaque, strip-like 
coverings (S1, S2) are applied by printing to both sides 

of a first layer of a transparent, multilayer film (2) in 
a regularly repeating manner and offset to one another in 

a defined manner, and similar coverings (S3) are applied 
by printing to the underside of at least one second 

layer, offset to the first coverings in a defined manner, 
wherein the layers comprise sections (I, II) which are 

different from one another and are provided with strip-like 
coverings arranged on a single film web (6) in a 

geometrically successive manner, and wherein the 
regularly repeating arrangement of the coverings (S1-S3) 

offset to one another in a defined manner is formed by 
folding the film web (6) and arranging the various 

sections (I, II) of the film web (6) one on top of the 
other. 
An anticopy film as claimed in claim 6, wherein 
an adhesive is provided on at least one of the sides of 

the sections (I, II) of the film web (6) which come to 
lie one on top of the other by folding. 
An anticopy film as claimed in claim 7, wherein 
the sides of the sections (I, II) of the film web (6) 

which are not provided with adhesive are provided with a 
protective coating which protects against mechanical 

and/or chemical influences and/or prevents light reflection. 
An anticopy film as claimed in any of claims 6 to 
8, wherein the coverings (S1-S3) comprise radiation-curing 

printing inks which minimize geometrical changes 
during drying. 
An anticopy film as claimed in any of claims 6 to 
9, which comprises a transparent film web on which at 

least two sections (I, II) printed with strip-like  
 

coverings (S1, S2, S3) and arranged parallel to one 
another or after one another are provided in the 

longitudinal or transverse direction.
