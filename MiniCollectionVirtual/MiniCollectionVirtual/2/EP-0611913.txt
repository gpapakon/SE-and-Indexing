<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a heating system for conveyor pipes 
1. A long heating pipe 2 is laid along a conveyor pipe 1 and 

in contact with the outer surface thereof. The heating pipe 
is provided with an outer tube 3 which has an operating fluid 

hermetically contained therein, and a steam tube 4 which is 
inserted through the outer tube 3. A container 6 is provided 

to accumulate condensation created as a result of the 
liquefaction of vapor fed through the steam tube 4 of the 

heating pipe 2. This container 6 has a temperature sensing 
valve located therein. The temperature sensing valve is 

closed if the condensation within the container 6 rises more 
in temperature than predetermined, and this valve is opened 

if the condensation within the container 6 decreases more in 
temperature than predetermined. The temperature sensing valve 

is communicatively connected to the downstream side end 
portion of the steam tube 4 of the heating pipe 2, which is 

inserted into the container 6.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heating system for 
conveyor pipes which transport through them fluid such as a 
heavy oil or the like. In general, a heavy oil or other similar fluid which has 
solidifiability, or viscosity increasing property under a low 
temperature, and undergoes thermal decomposition or other 
chemical phenomenon at a high temperature deteriorates in 
fluidity thereof in the winter season in which an atmospheric 
temperature is lower, because it is increased in the viscosity 
thereof. Therefore, in order to allow such a fluid to be 
smoothly conveyed through a conveyor pipe under a lower 
atmospheric temperature, provisions are made to heat the 
pipe, thereby decreasing the viscosity of the fluid which 
tends to increase. In a conventional heating system for 
conveyor pipes, the steam-trace heating method is executed by 
using a trap. The steam-trace heating method is available as 
two types. One of these two types is that a heating pipe is  
 
installed, and it is only formed with a steam layer therein 
to use the latent heat of the steam for heating the conveyor 
pipe, and the other is that a condensation layer is allowed 
to stay within the separately installed heating pipe, thereby 
utilizing the sensible heat thereof as well as the latent 
heat of the steam which is allowed to exit in the form of a 
layer. However, in the former type heating method in which a 
steam layer is only formed within the heating pipe to use the 
latent heat of the steam, overheating is locally introduced 
on the contact surfaces of the heating pipe and the conveyor 
pipe with each other, or the heat to the conveyor pipe is 
excessively great in quantity, whereby it is difficult that 
the heating temperature to the conveyor pipe is held to a 
suitable range. Also, the latter type heating method in which a condensation 
layer is allowed to stay in the heating pipe, the 
condensation layer is subjected to a temperature gradient on 
the downstream side thereof, and therefore, it is substantially 
impossible to know a total of precise quantity of heat 
given to the conveyor pipe. For this reason, it is difficult 
to estimate temperatures of the conveyor pipe and fluid 
flowing therethrough such as a heavy oil, which are to be  
 
heated. This is a disadvantage of the heating method in 
which a condensation layer is allowed to stay in the heating 
pipe. Therefore, a counterproposal is made such as an electric 
heater system long in size which heats the conveyor pipe 
evenly at any longitudinal portion
