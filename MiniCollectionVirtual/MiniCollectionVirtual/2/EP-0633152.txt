<ABSTRACT>
A rubber composition suitable for use in inner 
liners of pneumatic tyres and having an improved gas 

impermeablity which comprises a rubber and 5 to 60 
parts by weight of an acrylonitrile thermoplastic 

resin per 100 parts by weight of the rubber. The 
composition provides inner liners having an 

excellent retainability of inner pressure of tyres, 
thus enabling to decrease the weight of tyres by 

decreasing its gauge or to increase the inner 
pressure of tyres to higher levels so as to achieve 

energy saving.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rubber
composition suitable for inner liners of pneumatic
tyres, and more particularly to the provision of
inner liners having an improved impermeability to
gases and suitable for use in tyres which are
required to have a high retainability of tyre inner
pressure, such as radial tyres for passenger cars,
bias tyres for passenger cars, tyres for
motorcycles, tyres for auto trucks and tyres for
buses.From the viewpoints of energy saving and resource
saving, use of materials of low hysteresis loss and
efforts for lightening have been made in automobile
tyres in order to achieve low fuel consumption.
Further, it is expected that in future it will
become more important to develop tyres which
contribute to low fuel consumption, with the
popularisation of electric vehicles.With respect to the weight reduction of tyres, it is
proposed or practised (1) to decrease the depth of
the grooves in the tread and the width of the tread
together with improvement of the abrasion resistance 
of the tread rubber, (2) to substitute fibres
materials such as Kevlar (aramid fibre) for steel
materials, (3) to decrease the gauge or thickness of
sidewall with improvement in the cut resistance, or
(4) to decrease the gauge of the inner liner
together with improvement to its inner pressure
retainability. However, a still further improvement
is desired with respect to the inner pressure
retainability of the inner liner, since it has been
recently studied to raise the inner pressure of
tyres in order to achieve a low rolling resistance
of tyres.The inner liner is applied inside a tyre carcass
which is generally reinforced by a textile or steel
wire web. It is important that the inner liner has
a good inner pressure retainability in order to
minimise air migration from the inflation chamber
into the carcass structure of the tyre. The
parameters which control the inner pressure
retainability of the inner liner are its air
permeability and its gauge. Generally the inner
liner is made from a butyl-type rubber such as butyl
rubber or a halogenated butyl rubber, since butyl-type
rubber has a good air impermeabillity.
However, a further improvement in the air 
impermeability of the inner liner based on butyl-type
rubber is required in order to achieve weight
reduction of tyres by decreasing its gauge or in
order to meet the demand of raising the inner
pressure of tyres. An inner liner based on butyl-type
rubber also has the disadvantage that it is
poor in covulcanisability with other diene rubbers,
thus it
