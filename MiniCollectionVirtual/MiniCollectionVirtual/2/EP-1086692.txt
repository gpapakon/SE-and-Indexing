<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to estrogen agonists and their pharmaceutical uses.The value of naturally occurring estrogens and synthetic compositions
demonstrating "estrogenic" activity has been in their medical and therapeutic uses.
A traditional listing of the therapeutic applications for estrogens alone or in
combination with other active agents includes: oral contraception; relief for the
symptoms of menopause; prevention of threatened or habitual abortion; relief of
dysmenorrhea; relief of dysfunctional uterine bleeding; an aid in ovarian
development; treatment of acne; diminution of excessive growth of body hair in
women (hirsutism); the prevention of cardiovascular disease; treatment of
osteoporosis; treatment of prostatic carcinoma; and suppression of post-partum
lactation [Goodman and Gilman, The Pharmacological Basis Of Therapeutics
(Seventh Edition) Macmillan Publishing Company, 1985, pages 1421-1423].
Accordingly, there has been increasing interest in finding newly synthesized
compositions and new uses for previously known compounds which are
demonstrably estrogenic, that is, able to mimic the action of estrogen in estrogen
responsive tissue.From the viewpoint of pharmacologists interested in developing new drugs
useful for the treatment of human diseases and specific pathological conditions, it
is most important to procure compounds with some demonstrable estrogen-like
function but which are devoid of proliferative side-effects. Exemplifying this latter
view, osteoporosis, a disease in which bone becomes increasingly more fragile, is
greatly ameliorated by the use of fully active estrogens; however, due to the
recognized increased risk of uterine cancer in patients chronically treated with
active estrogens, it is not clinically advisable to treat osteoporosis in intact women
with fully active estrogens for prolonged periods. Accordingly estrogen agonists
are the primary interest and focus.Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease, characterized by low bone
mass and deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility
and susceptibility to fracture. In the U.S., the condition affects more that 25 million 
people and causes more than 1.3 million fractures each year, including 500,000
spine, 250,000 hip and 240,000 wrist fractures annually. These cost the nation
over $10 billion. Hip fractures are the most serious, with 5-20% of patients dying
within one year, and over 50% of survivors being incapacitated.The elderly are at greatest risk of osteoporosis, and the problem is
