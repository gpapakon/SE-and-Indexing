<DESCRIPTION>
It is known that certain microorganisms such as
bacteria are potentially beneficial when added to
animal feeds. For example, bacteria are beneficial in
that they supply a natural intestinal microflora.
Some companies offer for sale direct fed microbials
which contain desirable bacteria. Direct fed
microbials, however, do have some difficulty in
maintaining a stable product. Typically, the direct
fed microbial is used at a fairly small level, added
to feed at perhaps a 1% level. However, unused direct
fed microbial containing feed or feed additive product
is often stored by the farmers for long periods of
time. This storage many times is under conditions
where there is some moisture. In many instances there
is just enough moisture that the bacteria are
activated or start to grow, but yet there is an
insufficient amount of moisture to sustain them. As a
result they die. Thus, the activity of the direct fed
microbial is stopped. In other instances, the
addition of antibiotics to the direct fed microbial
containing feed or feed additive adversely interacts
with the bacteria, particularly if there are small
amounts of moisture present and thus again bacteria
are killed. Thus, there is a significant problem of
long term storage stability for direct fed microbials.In another environment, where the direct fed
microbial is added to, for example chicken feed, it is
common to pelletize the material with the direct fed
microbial added before pelletizing. Moisture from 
steam used during pelletization partially activates
the bacteria, but may, as a result of insufficient
moisture to sustain them, kill them. Also heat during
pelletization may kill them. Then, too, there is the
problem of the-acid environment of the stomach
potentially inactivating bacteria before they really
reach the intestine. Thus, there is a continuing need
for direct fed microbials which will release the
organisms only at the proper time in the intestine,
without early release due to moisture conditions or
adverse pH conditions such as exist in the digestive
tract anterior to the small intestine.It is important to note for purposes of this
invention that the free fatty acid does not
individually encapsulate and form microcapsules of
microorganisms. Instead, the product of the process
of the present invention forms microspheres. A
microsphere refers to a fatty acid matrix in which a
plurality of microorganisms are incorporated. It is
different from a microcapsule in which individual
organisms are encapsulated. In a microsphere the
fatty acid
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process of preparing discrete individual fatty
acid matrix microspheres of microorganisms, said

microorganisms dwelling in a fatty acid matrix, said
process comprising:


preparing a first feed stream of fatty acid melt of
a C
12
 to C
24
 fatty acid;
preparing a second feed stream of microorganism
culture;
feeding separately said culture feed stream and
said fatty acid melt feed stream into a rotary disc

processor to provide a mixture which is from 50% to about
90% by weight of said fatty acid melt; and
rotary disc microsphere processing said mixture in
a rotary disc processor to provide free-flowing fatty acid

matrix microspheres of organisms.
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterised in
that the rotary disc operates at an rpm within the range of

2000 rpm to 4000 rpm.
A process as claimed in claim 2, characterised in
that the rotary disc operates at an rpm within the range

of from 2500 rpm to 3200 rpm.
A process as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3,
characterised in that the feed rate of material into the

rotary disc processor is from 50 grams per minute to 200
grams per minute.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim,
characterised in that the fatty acid is stearic acid.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim,
characterised in that, the microorganism is a bacteria and

is 
Enterococcus faecium.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim,
characterised in that the first feed stream and second feed

stream are kept separate until the feeds contact the disc.
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the first feed stream and second feed

stream contact each other for a short time sufficient to
preserve microorganism viability prior to contacting the

disc.
A process as claimed in claim 8, characterised in
that the first feed stream and second feed stream contact

each other for less than one minute prior to contacting the
disc.
