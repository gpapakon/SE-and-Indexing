<ABSTRACT>
In the vehicle brake system a rate of force increase (Fv ped) of the brake pedal is detected and the brake pressure boosted as a function thereof in that during braking a threshold value (Fv max) is continually assigned to an instantaneous rate of force increase (Fv ped) of the brake pedal (10) at any one time. The instantaneous actual value for the rate of force increase (Fv ped) is compared with the respective threshold value (Fv max) and the brake booster (28) adjusted as a function of the result of the comparison.

<CLAIMS>
A brake pressure boosting system for control of the brake 
pressure in a motor vehicle brake system equipped with an 

electronically adjustable brake pressure booster (13),
characterized
 in that a sensor (12) is provided to detect a 
braking force (F ped) which acts on a brake pedal (10) and a 

differentiator means (14) generating an output signal (Fv ped) 
is provided to differentiate the braking force (F ped) so as 

to detect a force increase gradient (Fv ped) at the brake 
pedal and in response thereto boost the brake pressure in such 

manner that, during a braking operation, respective threshold 
values (Fv max) are associated successively with respective 

instantaneous force increase gradients (Fv ped) at the brake 
pedal (10), each instantaneous actual value of the force 

increase gradient (Fv ped) is compared in a comparator means 
(29) with the corresponding threshold value (Fv max), and an 

output signal (B) of the comparator means (29) serves to 
control the brake pressure booster (13).
