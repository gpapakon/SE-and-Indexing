<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a melamine resin foam.
More particularly, the present invention relates to a melamine resin
foam which is improved in fragility and water absorbability.As well known, melamine-formaldehyde resins are thermosetting
resins obtained by reacting melamine and formaldehyde
and are a kind of amino resin, and those having a high molecular
weight are in use as tableware or as surface sheets of tables, etc. It is
also known that melamine-formaldehyde resin foams show excellent
flame retardancy as compared with other organic resin foams.Melamine-formaldehyde resin foams, however, are very
fragile. Particularly when they are highly expanded, the fragility is
striking and, in some cases, the excellent water absorbability leads to
moisture retention. Use of melamine-formaldehyde foams as a construction
material, etc. for their excellent flame retardancy, was investigated,
but such use is not yet practiced because of the above
drawbacks.The object of the present invention is to provide a
melamine resin foam which is improved in fragility and water absorbability
and in which the drawbacks of the prior art have been alleviated.According to the present invention there is provided a
melamine resin foam comprising a foam body obtained by foaming a 
resin composition composed mainly of a melamine-formaldehyde condensate
and a blowing agent, and hydrophobic component coated on
said foam body wherein the foam has substantially open cells and wherein the
surfaces of the skeleton of the foam body is coated with the
hydrophobic component.The present inventors made a study with a thinking that
when a melamine-formaldehyde resin foam is coated with a hydrophobic
component, not only the resulting foam may have improved
(lower) water absorbability but also the coating of the hydrophobic
component may dissipate the load applied on the foam, resulting in (a)
reduction in fracture of foam skeleton and (b) consequent improvement
in fragility. As a result, the present invention has been completed.The present invention is hereinafter described in detail.The melamine resin foam of the present invention is obtained
by coating a hydrophobic component on a known melamine-formaldehyde
resin foam body obtained by foaming a resin composition
composed mainly of a melamine-formaldehyde condensate and a
blowing agent. The components used in the present melamine resin
foam can therefore be the same as those conventionally used in production
of melamine-formaldehyde resins or their foams, except for
the hydrophobic
