<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an instrument holder for the inspection of a dynamo-electric machine having a stator (1) and a rotor (2) in which the rotor (2) is somewhat cylindrically arranged around a main shaft (3) and can rotate about it and is fitted in a cylindrical recess in the stator (1) in relation to the main shaft (3) leaving a gap (4). The instrument holder can be inserted and moved in the gap (4) along the main shaft (3) and comprises the following components: a frame component (5) circularly surrounding the main shaft (3) to which can be secured means (6, 7, 8) for making the inspection, a plurality of rollers (9) which, looked at in a plane perpendicular to the main shaft (3), are mutually staggered and each of which is secured to the frame component (5) to be rotatable about an appropriate axis of rotation (10), the axis of rotation (10) being substantially perpendicular to the main shaft (3). The instrument holder can be inserted into the gap (4) without removing the rotor (2) and can be fitted with any instruments and auxiliaries for performing the inspection. It can be moved in the gap (4) without any risk of jamming as it is directly supported on the stator.

Instrument carrier for inspecting a dynamoelectric 
machine which has a stator (1) and a rotor (2), 

the rotor (2) being arranged in an approximately 
circularly cylindrical fashion relative to a main axis 

(3), in a manner rotatable about the main axis (3) and 
leaving a gap (4) in a recess of the stator which is 

approximately circularly cylindrical relative to the main 
axis (3), which instrument carrier carries means (6, 7, 

8) for carrying out the inspection and has a multiplicity 
of rollers (9) which, seen in a plane perpendicular to an 

axis of the instrument carrier, which axis is brought 
into coincidence with the main axis (3) during the 

inspection, are offset with respect to one another, and 
of which each can rotate about an associated axis (10) of 

rotation aligned essentially perpendicular to the axis, 
characterized by a frame part (5) which surrounds the 

axis in an annular fashion and on which the means (6, 7, 
8) for carrying out the inspection and the rollers (9) 

are mounted. 
Instrument carrier according to Claim 1, whose 
frame part (5) can be expanded in a radially elastic 

fashion relative to the main axis (3). 
Instrument carrier according to Claim 2, whose 
frame part (5) has at least one spring element (11) which 

is elastic in the tangential direction relative to the 
main axis (3). 
Instrument carrier according to Claim 3, whose 
frame part (5) has two or three spring elements (11). 
Instrument carrier according to one of Claims 2 
to 4, whose frame part (5) has at least one expansion  

 
device (12) by means of which the frame part (5) can be 

radially expanded and which can be operated externally 
via associated connecting leads (13). 
Instrument carrier according to Claim 5, in which 
the expansion device (12) is a pneumatic sliding device 

(12) acting in an approximately tangential direction 
relative to the main axis (3). 
Instrument carrier according to one of the 
preceding claims, which has: 


a) a multiplicity of roller frames (14), each of which 
carries rollers (9) arranged one behind another relative 

to the main axis (3); and 
b) a multiplicity of bent rods (15) by means of which the 
roller frames (14) are interconnected. 
Instrument carrier according to Claim 7, which 
has between four and eight, preferably six, roller frames 

(14). 
Instrument carrier according to Claim 7 or 8, in 
which in each case two rods (15) which are approximately 

2parallel to one another connect two roller frames (14) 
to one another. 
Instrument carrier according to one of Claims 7 
to 9, in which each rod (12) comprises an elastically 

flexible material. 
Instrument carrier according to one of the 
preceding claims, in which each roller (9) is curved 

outwards belly-like in the manner of a barrel. 
Instrument carrier according to one of the 
preceding claims, in which in each case two rollers (9) 

arranged one behind another relative to the main axis (3) 
are tightly adjacent to one another. 
Instrument carrier according to one of the 
preceding claims, which has a first motor (16) with 

power-transmitting devices (17), by means of which at 
least one roller (9) can be driven, the first motor (16) 

being externally operable via an associated connecting 
lead (18). 
Instrument carrier according to Claim 13, in  
 

which the first motor (16) is installed in a roller frame 
(14) having a plurality of rollers (9) which are arranged 

one behind another relative to the main axis (3) and can 
be driven by the first motor (16). 
Instrument carrier according to one of the 
preceding claims, which has an instrument platform (19) 

which is held on the frame part (5) and can be moved 
along the frame part (5) about the main axis (3), and 

which carries the means (6, 7, 8) for carrying out the 
inspection. 
Instrument carrier according to Claim 15, in 
which the frame part (5) has at least one guide rail (20) 

on which the instrument platform (19) is held. 
Instrument carrier according to Claim 16, in 
which the instrument platform (20) has a second motor 

(21) , which is force-closed with the frame part (5), in 
particular with the guide rail (20), and by means of 

which the instrument platform (19) can be moved, the 
second motor (21) being externally operable via an 

associated connecting lead (22).
