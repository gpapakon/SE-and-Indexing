<ABSTRACT>
A variable compression ratio mechanism of a
reciprocating engine includes at least an upper link

connected at one end to a piston pin and a lower link
connecting the other end of the upper link to a crankpin.

At top dead center, when, of hypothetical connecting
points between the upper and lower links, to be able to

be supposed on both sides of a line segment connecting
a piston-pin center and a crankpin center, a first one

of the connecting points has a smaller inclination angle
measured in the same direction as a direction of rotation

of the crankshaft from an axial line of reciprocating
motion of the piston-pin center and formed between a line

segment connecting the piston-pin center and the first
connecting point as compared to the second connecting

point, the first connecting point is selected as an actual
connecting point.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a variable compression ratio mechanism of a
reciprocating internal combustion engine according to the preamble of
independent claim 1.Such a variable compression ratio mechanism of a reciprocating internal
combustion engine is known from prior art document US 5,595,146.In order to vary a compression ratio between the
volume in the engine cylinder with the piston at bottom
dead center (BDC) and the volume with the piston at top
dead center (TDC) depending upon engine operating
conditions such as engine speed and load, in recent years,
there have been proposed multiple-link type
reciprocating piston engines each employing a
multiple-link type piston crank mechanism (multiple-link
type variable compression ratio mechanism) composed
of three links, namely an upper link, a lower link, and
a control link.In a multiple-link type variable compression ratio
mechanism, assuming that an angle (an inclination angle
of an upper link) between an axial line of the upper
link and an axial line of the direction of reciprocating
motion of a piston pin center, becomes approximately 0°
nearby TDC, there are some drawbacks, for the reasons
discussed below.A piston side thrust force is dependent upon the
inclination angle  and combustion load, and thus an 
instantaneous energy loss based on a coefficient of
friction between the cylinder wall (major thrust face)
and the piston, piston speed, and piston side thrust force
is also dependent upon the inclination angle  of the
upper link. Therefore, it is desirable to properly set
the inclination angle  in particular at a timing point
that the product of piston velocity and combustion load
becomes maximum after TDC on the compression stroke, from
the viewpoint of reduced piston thrust face wear, reduced
piston slapping noise, and reduced energy loss.It is an objective of the present invention is to provide a variable compression
mechanism of a reciprocating internal combustion engine, wherein said
engine can be operated with high efficiency.According to the present invention, said objective is solved by a variable
compression mechanism of a reciprocating internal combustion engine having
the features of independent claim 1.Preferred embodiments are laid down in the dependent claims.Herein after, the present invention is illustrated and explained by means of
preferred embodiments in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. In
the drawings, wherein:

embodiment of the variable compression ratio
