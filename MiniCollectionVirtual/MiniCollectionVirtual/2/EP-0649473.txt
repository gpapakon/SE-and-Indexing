<ABSTRACT>
A method for amplifying infectious agents for (in vitro) diagnosis in a cell culture, wherein an ecosystem is used (in vitro) to amplify the conventional technique for the cell culture of viruses (e.g. HSV and RSV) and bacteria (e.g. Chlamydiae, Legionella and Hyteria). The method is particularly useful in searching for infectious agents, and, for this purpose, said cell culture is infected (in vitro) with mycoplasmata for inducing a cell response potentiated by the presence of the mycoplasma(ta) being used.

Method of amplifying infectious agents for 
in vitro
 diagnosis in cell cultures, 
characterised by the use of an ecosystem representing the pathological sphere 

concerned, reconstituted 
in vitro
 with cells receptive to the said agents, with the 
addition of living mycoplasmas as an element for facilitating viral or bacterial 

multiplication in a cell culture of viruses (e.g. HSV, RSV) and bacteria (e.g. 
Chlamydiae, Legionella, Listerria). 
Method of amplifying infectious agents for 
in vitro
 diagnosis in cell cultures 
according to claim 1, characterised in that the cell cultures are infected 
in vitro with
 
living mycoplasmas so as to induce a cell response facilitated by the presence of the 

living mycoplasma(s) used. 
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that for the research and 
amplification of infectious agents, cells and living mycoplasmas which are selected 

according to the sphere where sample is carried out and infectious agents being 
sought are used. 
Method according to either of claims 2 or 3, characterised in that the cell cultures 
are infected in a medium compatible with the dual viability of the cell and living 

mycoplasma with living mycoplasmas previously brought into a growth phase in their 
culture medium. 
Method according to claim 4, according to which the cells are cultivated in Petri 
dishes, characterised in that their infection or mycoplasmisation is carried out in the 

following manner: the Petri dishes are emptied of their floating surplus, are then 
infected with the medium containing the living mycoplasmas and with the cell culture 

medium, and are then incubated for about one hour with slow stirring, between 36 and 
39°C; the dishes complemented with the culture medium are monitored under a 

microscope; trypsin is added 2 to 3 days after infection, and the dishes are cultivated in 
their usual surroundings.  

 
Method according to any one of claims 2 to 5, characterised in that the signal 
increase due to the presence of living mycoplasmas in cell cultures is demonstrated by 

comparison between the levels of infection obtained with cells to which mycoplasma 
has been added and normal homologous cells; the infections taking place 

simultaneously with a homogeneous inoculant on cells at the same stage of 
confluence. 
Method according to claim 6, characterised in that disclosure of the infection is 
obtained by immunological marking on a membrane of a specific antigen of the 

infectious agent, detected by a monoclonal antibody directed against this antigen, and 
marked by an enzyme, itself disclosed by a chromogenic substrate; the intensity of 

colouration, expressed in + on a scale from 0 to 4+ (+/- representing the maximum 
value comparable to background noise), is proportional to the quantity of antigens 

present and makes it possible to evaluate the intensity of the infection; the level of 
detection being confirmed by conventional titration of the infectious strength by limited 

dilution on a microchip. 
Method according to either of claims 6 or 7 applied to the disclosure of a viral or 
bacterial infection, characterised in that the infection of the cell culture, prior to 

disclosure, is effected according to a standard protocol; the cells (both those with 
mycoplasma and those without and acting as a control) are emptied of their floating 

surplus and are inoculated with slow stirring for one hour at 37°C by the infectious 
agent in a small volume (dilution in cell culture medium without serum, referred to as 

supplement), supplement is then added, then the cells are incubated at 37°C for 3 
days.
