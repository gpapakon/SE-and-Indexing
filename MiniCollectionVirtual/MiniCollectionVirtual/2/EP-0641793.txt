<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel 5-amino-8-methyl-7-pyrrolidinylquinoline-3-carboxylic 
acid derivative, its stereoisomer and a 
pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof which have an excellent antibacterial 
activity and to the method of preparation thereof. The present invention also 
relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of the 
derivative which is useful in the treatment of infectious disease, and it also 
relates to a method of treatment and to synthetic intermediates. Ciprofloxacin is a well documented antibacterial agent with a quinoline 
nucleus in which a cyclopropyl group occupies position 1 (The Merck Index, 11th 
Edition, 2315). Efforts to improve ciprofloxacin have included preparations of numerous 
substituents at positions 5, 7 and 8, however the present invention relates to 
the first preparation to date of a quinolone compound with an amino group at 
position 5 and a methyl group at position 8 in combination with a pyrrolidinyl 
group at position 7. To date, the antibacterial activity of quinolone compounds has either been 
insufficient or when sufficient has been accompanied by severe adverse reactions 
such as phototoxicity, chromosomal aberration, convulsions, etc. and so these 
latter agents have posed safety problems. The following citations document the above problems of the quinolone 
antibacterial agents:  
 
1) "Quinolone Antimicrobial Agents", 2nd Edition, Chapter 26, ed. by D.C. 
Hooper and J.S. Wolfson, American Society for Microbiology, Washington D.C., 
1993, p.489 (concerned with phototoxicity, chromosomal aberration, convulsions, 
etc.) 2) Mutagenicity Tests, 2 (3), p.154 (1993) (Chromosomal aberrations, etc.) 3) Environ. Mol. Mutagen., 13, p.238 (1989) (Chromosomal aberrations, etc.) The following outlines the relation of particular characteristics of the 
substituents used at the individual positions with the above problems. For 
instance, it is understood that the placing of a relatively bulky substituent 
such as a chlorine atom or methyl group at position 8 of the quinoline nucleus 
is desirable for the antibacterial activity, but many of the compounds which 
have a chlorine atom as the substituent at position 8 give rise to severe 
adverse reactions such as phototoxicity or chromosomal aberrations, etc. while 
compounds with a methyl substituent give rise to severe adverse reactions such 
as chromosomal aberrations, etc. Such compounds pose great problems with regard 
to their safety. A substituent widely used for position
