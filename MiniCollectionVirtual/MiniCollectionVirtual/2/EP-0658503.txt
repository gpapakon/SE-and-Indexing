<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a sheet 
conveying apparatus wherein a pair convey rollers (6) 

arranged upstream of a registration means (8) for 
correcting a skew-feed of a sheet in a sheet conveying 

direction can be abutted against or separated from each 
other, or can be shifted in accordance with a length of 

the sheet in the sheet conveying direction. As the 
result, when the skew-feed of the sheet is corrected by 

the registration means (8), a trailing end of the sheet is 
not restrained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet
conveying apparatus according to the preambles of claims 1 and 5. Those sheet conveying apparatuses are used with an image forming
apparatus or image reading apparatus such as a copying
machine, a scanner, a printer and the like. More
particularly, it relates to a sheet conveying apparatus
wherein registration of sheet is effected at an
upstream side of an image forming portion or an image
reading portion.Conventionally, in image forming or image
reading apparatuses such as copying machines, scanners,
printers and the like, a registration device for
determining posture and position of a sheet is arranged
immediately in front of an image forming portion or an
image reading portion. As such registration devices,
for example, there has been proposed a registration
device of loop registration type wherein a tip end of a
sheet is abutted against a nip between a pair of
stopped rollers to form a loop in the sheet, so that
the tip end of the sheet is aligned with the nip,
thereby correcting skew-feed of the sheet, and a
registration device of shutter registration type
wherein a shutter member for stopping a tip end of a 
sheet is retractably arranged in a sheet conveying
path. After the tip end of the sheet is abutted
against the shutter member to correct skew-feed of the
sheet, the shutter member is retracted from the sheet
conveying path.However, recently, as such image forming or
image reading apparatuses have been changed into
digital design, a distance between sheets (referred to
as "sheet interval" hereinafter) has been shortened so
that a large number of sheets can be treated within a
short time period, thereby increasing substantial image
forming speed without increasing a process speed for
image formation.For example, in conventional digital copying
machines, when a copying operation is performed
continuously, since an optical system for exposing an
original must be reciprocally shifted by times
corresponding to the number of copies, the sheet
interval used in an image information copying operation
is necessarily determined. However, when the original
is digitally read and the image is digitally formed,
after the original was read once, the image information
is electrically coded to be stored in a memory. In the
image formation, the image information is read out from
the memory, and a latent image corresponding to the
image information is formed on a photosensitive member
disposed in the image forming portion by using an 
exposure device including a laser beam
