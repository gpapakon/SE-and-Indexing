<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a bead assembly for use in a 
pneumatic tire includes extruding a strip of green elastomeric 

material (1) onto a split or pair of steel supporting guide rings (2,3) 

where the ends of the extruded strip are cut at a bias angle 
and then spliced together to form an annular elastomeric 

member (23). The extruded strip and formed annular member has a 
pair of tapered longitudinal end members (10,11) joined by a central 

recess (12). An annular tire bead (26) is placed in radial alignment 
about the central recess of the annular member. Next, a 

segmented mandrel (8) carrying inflatable turnup bladders (5,6) is 
expanded outwardly, afterwhich the split guide ring is axially 

withdrawn. The mandrel and bladders then provide the support 
for the elastomeric member previously provided by the split 

annular ring, and traps the bead within the central recess. 
The two longitudinal end members of the extruded strip are 

then turned up about the bead by inflating the bladders to 
form the bead assembly (15), afterwhich the assembly is placed in 

a shaping mold (35). If desired, an annular strip of reinforcing 
material (30) may be placed concentrically about the bead before 

the end members are turned up about the bead, to provide 
internal reinforcement for the bead assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of forming a 
bead assembly according to the preamble of claim 1. Such a 
method is known from the teachings of the GB-A-1 003 712. One of the components of a pneumatic tire is the 
bead assembly which consists of an annular bead, usually 
formed of a wound metal band or cable, which is combined with 
an elastomeric bead filler usually having a generally 
triangular configuration. The bead assembly then is formed 
as part of the final tire and used for maintaining the 
inflated tire on its mounting rim. It is desirable when 
producing the bead assembly that it be as free as possible of 
nonuniform areas and any out of roundness or unwanted 
projections or depressions, all of which add to the 
nonuniformity of the final tire in which it is incorporated. 
Furthermore, it is desirable that the bead assemblies be 
produced as efficiently and inexpensively as possible in order 
to decrease the cost of the final tire. Many known methods for producing tire bead 
assemblies extrude the bead filler with its final triangular 
shape, afterwhich it is placed on the bead and secured thereto  
 
subsequent to curing. However, during these manufacturing 
methods it is difficult to handle the uncured green 
elastomeric bead filler due to its extreme flexibility, 
without distorting the bead filler. Even minor distortions 
can cause undesirable nonuniformity in the final tire. Examples of prior art methods and apparatus for 
forming tire bead assemblies are shown in the following 
patents. U.S. Patent No. 1,536,080 discloses a very early 
method of forming a tire bead in which a fabric is coated with 
a slow curing rubber and encloses a core ring and a filler of 
faster curing rubber, afterwhich the bead core is semi-cured 
to a degree which partially vulcanizes the filler and leaves 
the external coating soft and tacky whereupon the bead core 
can be incorporated into a tire casing. U.S. Patent No. 4,410,389 shows a bead filler 
assembly apparatus wherein the filler is extruded in a 
triangular configuration and is placed and attached to the 
bead. U.S. Patent No. 4,662,961 discloses a method of 
forming a bead assembly in which an elastomeric strip is 
extruded in order to impart a substantially circular cross-sectional 
configuration thereto with a square cross-sectional 
channel formed therein. An adhesive is then applied, 
afterwhich a wire is wound around the support until the 
channel is filled to form the final bead assembly. U.S. Patent No. 4,933,034 discloses another

<CLAIMS>
A method of forming a bead assembly (15) comprising 
a bead filler and an annular bead (26), wherein an elongated 

strip (1) of elastomeric material having a pair of longitudinal 
end members (10,11) and an intervening recess (12) is extruded 

and cut ends (20) of the strip are spliced together to form 
an annular elastomeric member (23), and the annular bead (26) is 

placed about the annular elastomeric member (23) in radial 
alignment with the recess (12), and then the two longitudinal 

end members (10,11) are turned around the bead (26) and into 
contact with each other to form the annular bead assembly (15) 

characterized by the steps of: 

winding a predetermined length of the strip (1) of 
elastomeric material about a rigid annular supporting structure 

(2,3) prior to forming the annular elastomeric member (23) and 
prior to the placement of the annular bead (26) thereabout; 
locking the bead (26) within the recess (12) of the 
strip (1) of elastomeric material by expansion of a segmented 

expandable mandrel (7,8); and 
withdrawing the rigid annular supporting structure
