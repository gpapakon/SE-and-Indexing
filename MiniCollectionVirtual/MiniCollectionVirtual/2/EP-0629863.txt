<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device for data-carrier controlled enabling of a current supply are introduced. The device preferably consists of an auxiliary device which is intended to be mounted on an electricity meter and has a power switch which can be driven by a control device, via which the current supply for the user or electricity customer assigned to the electricity meter is enabled in accordance with the data which can be supplied externally via the data carrier. The data carrier is written with an electricity meter number, current withdrawal data as well as a reference which is a measure for the processes of rewriting the data carrier. The control device compares this data and enables the current supply in the event of a positive comparison result by driving the power switch. The control device then changes its internal reference. Advantages:     - only one data carrier necessary   - high security
