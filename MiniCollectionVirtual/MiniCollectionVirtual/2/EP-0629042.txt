<ABSTRACT>
In an optical transmission system a signal received from a glass fibre (4) 
is fed to an optoelectrical converter (8). 
To reduce the influence of parasitic capacitors (9, 11) the two connecting 
points of the optoelectrical converter are connected to a reference potential 
via
 an equal-impedance 
element (24, 20, 22; 30, 32). As a result, a symmetrical signal voltage is 

developed across the optoelectrical converter, so that the influence of capacitors 9 and 
11 is reduced by a factor of 2.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical transmission system comprising an 
optical transmitter coupled over an optical channel to an optical receiver, the optical 
receiver comprising an optoelectrical converter and an amplifier while a first connecting 
point of the optoelectrical converter is coupled to a first input of the amplifier. The invention likewise relates to an optical receiver to be used in a system 
of this type. A transmission system as defined in the opening paragraph is known from 
the brochure "2610 B Broadband Photodiode Module", Ortel Corporation, May 1991. Such a transmission system is used, for example, for TV signal 
distribution over large distances. This takes place, for example, in cable TV networks 
for TV signal transmission from a remote header station to a cable TV main distribution 
network. The cable TV signal to be transmitted comprising a frequency multiplex 
of TV and radio signals is used for amplitude modulation of a light source. The light 
source will generally comprise a semiconductor laser. The modulated light signal is sent 
from an optical channel, for example, a glass fibre to the optical receiver. In the optical 
receiver the light signal is converted into an electric signal which can be further 
distributed in the cable network. The cable TV signal has a frequency range from Â± 80 MHz to 900 MHz. 
This means that the transmission system is to be suitable for broadband signals. A 
requirement frequently made on such transmission systems is a passband which is flat 
within several tenths of dB's or increases with a certain slope with increasing 
frequency. Although the transfer characteristic of the prior-art optical transmission 
system is flat within 1 dB, a flatter transfer characteristic is desired. It is an object of the invention to provide an optical transmission system 
as defined in the opening paragraph in which the flatness of the transfer characteristic is 
improved.  For this purpose, the invention is characterized in that the first connecting 
point of the optoelectrical converter is coupled to a reference potential via a first 
impedance element, and in that a second connecting point of the optoelectrical converter 
is coupled to a second input of the amplifier and, across a second impedance element 
equal to the first impedance element, to the reference potential. By the measures according to the invention the electric signal is fully 
balanced with respect to the reference potential. The influence of parasitic capacitances 
between the connecting
