<ABSTRACT>
Fuel injection device for internal combustion engines with a high pressure accumulator (9), fillable by a high pressure fuel pump (1), from which accumulator high pressure lines (13) lead off to the individual injection valves (15). At the same time control valves (17) are inserted in the individual high pressure lines (13) in order to control the high pressure injection to the injection valves (15), together with an additional pressure reservoir (19) between the said control valves (17) and the high pressure accumulator (9). In order at the same time to be able to modify the rate-of-discharge curve on the injection valve, the control valve (17) has a hydraulic restrictor (51) arranged on an additional flange (39) on the valve element (23) and a damping chamber (53) formed between the flange (39) and a flat valve seat (47), the restricted relief of which chamber retards the opening movement of the valve element (23) at the start of injection.

Fuel injection device for internal combustion
engines, with a fuel-pressure pump (1) which conveys

fuel out of a low-pressure space (5) into a high-pressure
collecting space (9) which is connected, via

high-pressure conduits (13), to injection valves (15)
which project into the combustion space of the internal

combustion engine to be supplied and the opening and
closing movement of which is controlled in each case by

an electrically activated control valve (17) arranged
in the high-pressure conduit (13) on the injection

valve (15), the control valve (17) having a piston-shaped
valve member (23) with two valve sealing

surfaces facing away from one another, characterized in
that a first conical valve sealing surface (31)

arranged on an annular web (33) co-operates with a
conical valve seat (35) and a second flat valve sealing

surface (34) arranged on a collar (39) co-operates with
a flat valve seat (47) surrounding a bore (45), and

with a pressure space (49) which is delimited by the
flat and conical valve seat (47, 35) and surrounds the

annular web (33) in the collar (39) and the wall of
which has, in the region of the collar (39), a small

clearance in relation to the circumferential surface of
the said collar, the clearance forming a throttle (51),

there being formed between the flat sealing surface
(43) on the collar (39) and the flat valve seat (47),

when the flat-seat valve is opened, a damping space
(53) which can be connected to a relief space (65) via 

a relief duct (55) of small cross-section which is
adjacent to the flat valve seat (47) and which is

formed between the bore (45) and the piston shank (41)
of the valve member (23), the said piston shank being

guided in the said bore.
Fuel injection device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that a first annular groove (37) is

provided on the valve member (23) between the collar
(39) and the annular web (33), the inside diameter of

the said annular groove being equal to the diameter of
a second annular groove (59) which adjoins the conical

valve sealing surface (31) of the valve member (23) and
which is delimited, at its end facing away from the

annular web (33), by a guide-piston part (61) on the
valve member (23), the said guide-piston part being

guided sealingly in a guide bore (63).
Fuel injection device according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the outside diameter of the

collar (39) is equal to the outside diameter of the
annular web (33).
Fuel injection device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that a pressure conduit (73) leads

away from the pressure space (49) to the injection
valve (15).
Fuel injection device according to Claim 2,
characterized in that an annular space (60), into which

the high-pressure conduit (13) opens, is formed, in the
region of the second annular groove (59), between the

valve member (23) and the wall of the guide bore (63).
Fuel injection device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the valve member (23) has an

axial passage bore (69) with a transverse bore (71)
which intersects the latter in the region of the relief

duct (55) and which connects the relief duct (55) to
the relief space (65) which is delimited by the guide-piston

part (61) and from which a return conduit (67)
leads away into the low-pressure space (5).
Fuel injection device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that, on each injection valve (15), an 

additional pressure accumulator space (19) is provided
in the high-pressure conduit (13) between the high-pressure

collecting space (9) and the control valve
(17).
Fuel injection device according to Claim 7,
characterized in that the pressure accumulator space

(19) is arranged in the housing (21) of the control
valve (17).
Fuel injection device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the valve member (23) of the

control valve (17) is arranged at right angles to the
axis of the valve member (79) of the injection valve

(15).
