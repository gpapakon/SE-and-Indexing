<ABSTRACT>
The radio means (BM, FM) effecting the wireless transmission to communication terminals (KE) are arranged in a base station (BS) and the switching means (ELIC) effecting the switching of the communication terminals (KE) wirelessly connected to the base stations (BS) are arranged in the communication system (KS). In addition, transmission means (OCTAT, DSAC), which are connected via link lines (VL) transmitting the digitised voice and signalling information in accordance with the time division method are provided in the communication system and in the base stations (BS). With the aim of reducing the number of linklines (VL) for a base station (BS), compression means (ADPCM) which compress and decompress and echo-suppress the digitised voice signals are provided in the communication system (KS). By dividing the switching means (ELIC), the radio means (BM, FM) and the transmission means (OCTAT, DSAC) and by using compression means (DPCM), a particularly economic program- and circuit-related tying of multicellular wireless telecommunication systems to a communication system can be achieved, taking into consideration considerable integration of these components into integrated circuits.
