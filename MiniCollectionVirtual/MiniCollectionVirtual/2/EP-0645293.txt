<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a freight waggon for forming a rail-bound freight train for combined rail and road transport. The latter has a tailgate-less loading platform (3) which serves to receive an interchangeable body for lorries which is positioned symmetrically over the rails (25) on four integrated stilts (4) at the level of a lorry flat bed. In addition, the said goods waggon contains built-in lifting means (5, 11) with which an interchangeable body can be lifted and lowered when stationary. The structure clearance of the empty goods waggons (1) is smaller in terms of height and width over its entire length when the lifting means (5, 11) are lowered than the structure clearance below the exchangeable body. By means of horizontal play in the longitudinal direction and in the transverse direction in the lifting means (5, 11), the interchangeable body which is received by the said means can be aligned in the raised state with the longitudinal central axis and the transverse axis of the freight waggon (1) to indexing precision. In order to be able to transfer interchangeable bodies of different standing heights using the goods waggon in a way which requires little space and is economical within a train configuration, according to the invention the following designs are provided: the loading platform (3) is constructed as a component which is separate from the waggon chassis and can be moved in relation to it and can not only be lifted and lowered using the lifting means (5, 11) but can also be moved horizontally in three degrees of freedom of movement by virtue of a horizontal floating guide (8). Two pairs of vertically aligned centring elements (9) - centring pin and centring funnel - which engage in one another in a centring fashion when the loading platform is lowered are arranged on the loading platform (3) and on the chassis of the waggon and are dimensioned to be larger than the degree of displacement of the loading platform (3).

A rail-mounted freight wagon (1) for long distance combined rail/road freight haulage, 
in which 


the freight wagon (1) comprises a sideless loading platform (3) for the secure-transit 
accommodation of an interchangeable superstructure (6) for lorries which 

is standing on four integrated stilts (4) symmetrically over the tracks (25) at 
platform truck height, 
the freight wagon (1) further comprises inboard elevating means with which an 
interchangeable superstructure (6) can be raised and lowered by a height of lift and 

preferably by at least 40 cm, 
the railway loading gauge of the empty freight wagon (1) over its entire length 
and when the hoisting means are lowered is smaller in height and width - but less 

so in the height direction by less than the aforesaid height of lift - than the railway 
clearance profile under the interchangeable superstructure (6) which is set down 

over the tracks (25), 
whereby, by virtue of horizontal manoeuvrability in the longitudinal and transverse 
directions, the interchangeable superstructure (6), once received and in the raised 

condition, can be aligned in relation to the longitudinal median and transverse axes 
of the freight wagon with indexing precision in respect of the wagon chassis (2), 
 
characterised in that 


the loading platform (3) which, in respect of the wagon chassis (2) is constructed 
as a separate part adapted for movement in relation to the said chassis (2) can be 

raised and lowered by means of inboard elevating means, 
the inboard elevating means are, at the top, connected via a horizontal floating 
guide (8) for horizontal movement with the loading platform (3) in three degrees 

of freedom of movement, whereby the floating guide (8) is so constructed that a  
 
displacement of the loading platform (3) in the longitudinal and transverse 
direction by in each case an amount which corresponds to the switching tolerance 

of the interchangeable super-structure (6) of the tracks (25) and a pivoting of the 
loading platform (3) about a vertical axis within the scope of the amount of 

displacement in any desired combinations of the three aforementioned movements 
are made possible, and 
whereby there are on the loading platform (3) and on the wagon chassis (2) during 
or after lowering of the loading platform (3) means which come into action for the 

power-assisted centring of the loading platform (3) which is under load and in 
relation to the wagon chassis (1) in the longitudinal and transverse directions. 
A freight wagon according to claim 1, characterised in that as a means of power-assisted 
and automatic centring during lowering of the loading platform (3) there are on 

the loading platform (3) and on the wagon chassis (2), spaced apart from one another in 
the horizontal direction, at least two centringly interengaging pairs of vertically aligned 

centring elements - centring spigots (10) and centring cups (9), the opening in the centring 
cups (9) being larger than the amount of displacement of the loading platform (3) in 

respect of the elevating means (air spring bellows 5, parallelogram guide 11) and whereby 
the centring spigots (10), in the raised state of the loading platform (3), have their tips 

axially in the region of the greatest inside diameter of the centring cups (9) and in the 
lowered state of the loading platform (3) axially outside the smallest inside diameter of the 

centring cups (9). 
A freight wagon according to claim 1, characterised in that as means for the power-assisted

compression webs (26) and on the wagon chassis (2) and co-operating with the 
compression webs (26), pressure rollers (27) with a vertical axis of rotation and each of
