<ABSTRACT>
A truck tractor and trailer electrical communication system having one 
electronic control unit (8) located in tractor and another electronic control unit 

(40) located in at least one trailer both respectively controlling the state of a 
plurality of switching devices (10A,10B,12A,12B,13A,13B,14,44,56,66) to 

establish the appropriate electrical connection into and out of a standard seven 
pin tractor/trailer electrical connector (22,24) where high speed data 

communication links are used for control and diagnostics.

<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation-in-part of application USSN:
07/804,302 filed December 9, 1991, now abandoned.This invention relates to a truck tractor and semi-trailer
electrical communication system and more specifically
to a tractor and semi-trailer electrical wiring
system that employs an electronic control unit associated
with the tractor to detect the presence or lack thereof of
a second electronic control unit associated with the semi-trailer
to set the state of a plurality of electrical
switches that control the operation of various devices and
subsystems.Prior to the invention and commercialization of new
electrical systems on heavy and medium duty over the road
trucks, the requirements for electrical communication
between the truck tractor and trailer or semi-trailer
could be accommodated with a seven (7) pin connector which
has become standard equipment in the industry. This connector
provided for the conduction of power to various
truck circuits including turn signals, side markers, stop
lamps and a ground reference. As a standardized connection
scheme, it allows for intermixed connection between various
types of tractors and trailers.The term "tractor" as used herein refers to any truck
vehicle which tows an attached vehicle. It therefore 
includes trucks and truck tractors. It also includes
trailers which are equipped to tow other trailers. The
term "trailer" as used herein refers to a towed truck
vehicle and includes full truck trailers and truck semi-trailers.The prior art seven pin connector in its standard
configuration does not supply any full time electrical
power to the trailer. Recently, advances in truck technology
have seen the introduction of advanced truck systems
such as antilock brakes, diagnostics, electronically
enhanced braking, trailer anti-swing control and fault
detection. All of these systems would benefit from input
power and output signal lines that cannot be handled over
the commonly used seven pin connector. Also, the pin and
socket dimensions of the standard connector (10 gauge) are
not adequate for high amperage connections since a single
standard pin and socket is limited in its power handling
capacity and multiple pin and sockets must be used to
conduct current levels as required when using the
aforementioned advanced systems. In addition, future
tractors and trailers will be equipped with a diagnostic
data bus and a high speed data bus probably using one of
the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) specified protocols
with each bus structure requiring two (2)

A tractor and trailer electrical communication
system including


a tractor electronic control unit (8) for generating
and receiving electrical signals connected to a tractor

electrical system (20), said tractor electronic control
unit (8) having a plurality of signal output lines (25A,

25B,26A,26B) and at least one power output line (VBATT); a
first plurality of switching devices (10A,10B,12A,12B,

13A,13B) for connecting and disconnecting said signal
output lines (17,25A,25B,26A,26B) and said power output

line (VBATT) to and from a first electrical connector
(22), said first plurality of switching devices (10A,10B,

12A,12B,13A,13B) controlled by said tractor electronic
control unit (8);
a second plurality of switching devices (16) for connecting
and disconnecting said tractor electrical system

(20) to and from said first electrical connector (22),
said second plurality of switching devices (16) controlled

by said tractor electronic control unit (8) where electrical
power from said power output line (VBATT) is selectively

routed to said first electrical connector (22)
being joined to a second electrical connector (24) at a

trailer,

where said tractor electronic control unit (8) generates
and outputs an inquiry code on one of said signal

output lines (17,25A,25B,26A,26B) and then closes or opens
each of said first plurality of switching devices (10A,10B,12A,12B,13A,13B) and each 

of said second plurality of switching devices (16)
according to receiving or not receiving

one or more predetermined responses thereto from said
trailer; and
a trailer electronic control unit (40) for generating
and receiving electrical signals,
said second electrical connector (24) from said
trailer being connected to at least two output switches

(56) and to a trailer electronic system (23), the state of
each of said output switches (56) being controlled by said

trailer electronic control unit (40),
said trailer electronic control unit (40) also controlling
the state of each of a third plurality of switching

devices (44) connecting said second electrical connector
(24) to a trailer electrical system (28) and
said trailer electronic control unit (40) also controlling
the state to each of a fourth plurality of

switching devices (66) connecting said trailer electronic
control unit (40) to said trailer electrical system (28)

a data bus network (77) carrying a data stream connected to and controlled
by said trailer electronic control unit (40) where said

data stream includes a marker code.
The tractor and trailer electrical communication
system of claim 1, wherein said marker code is regenerated

by each of said trailer electronic control units (40) by
incrementing or decrementing said marker code for identification

of said trailer by said tractor electronic control
unit (8).
The tractor and trailer electrical communication 
system of claim 1, further comprising a diagnostic bus

network (76) connected to and controlled by said trailer
electronic control unit (40).
