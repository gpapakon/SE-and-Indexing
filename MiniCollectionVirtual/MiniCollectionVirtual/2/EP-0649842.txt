<ABSTRACT>
Provided is a process for preparing carbonylated derivatives 
of amino- and haloamino-1,3,5-triazines by contacting the 

1,3,5-triazine, carbon monoxide and a metal catalyst system 
containing a metal promoter for promoting carbonylation, at a 

temperature, carbon monoxide pressure, and length of time 
sufficient to carbonylate at least a portion of the amino 

and/or haloamino groups of the 1,3,5-triazine. The product 
resulting from contacting these components is an isocyanate 

functional 1,3,5-triazine; however, the carbamate functional 
derivative can be readily produced by contacting these 

components in the further presence of a hydroxy compound, or 
by post-reacting the isocyanate functional product with such 

hydroxy compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing
derivatives of (halo)amino compounds by carbonylation.Various derivatives of (halo)amino-1,3,5-triazines are
described in the literature as being utilized in a wide
variety of fields. An important use of certain of these
derivatives, such as methoxymethyl derivatives of melamine
and guanamines, is as crosslinkers and/or reactive modifiers
in curable compositions which contain resins having active
hydrogen groups. While these methoxymethyl derivatives
provide excellent results in a number of aspects, they also
have the disadvantage of releasing formaldehyde as a volatile
by-product under curing conditions. It has long been a
desire of industry to find acceptable alternatives which do
not emit formaldehyde upon cure.One such alternative that has shown great promise is
carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazines which are disclosed in
US-A-4,939,213, US-A-5,084,541, US-A-5,288,865, EP-A-0604922
and EP-0624577. Specifically, the carbamate functional
1,3,5-triazines disclosed in these references have been found
to be particularly useful as crosslinkers in coating
compositions based upon hydroxy functional resins, with the
cured coatings possessing a wide range of desirable
properties.One hinderance to the commercial use of these carbamate
functional 1,3,5-triazines has been that the known
preparation methods can be somewhat cumbersome, difficult and
expensive. For example, in US-A-4,939,213 and US-A-5,084,541,
the 1,3,5-triazine carbamates are produced in a
two-step process by first reacting an 
amino-1,3,5-triazine with oxalyl chloride to produce an
isocyanate functional intermediate, then reacting this
intermediate with an alcohol. Further, in US 5,288,865,
carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazines are produced in a one-step
process by reacting a haloamino-1,3,5-triazine with an
acid halide. The primary disadvantages to these processes
include the use of certain costly halogenated starting
materials, production of substantial amounts of halogenated
by-products, and low ultimate yield of the desired products.Many of the problems with these processes have been solved by
the process disclosed in EP-0624577 wherein carbamate
functional 1,3,5-triazines are produced by reacting an at
least bis-amino 1,3,5-triazine with an acyclic organic
carbonate in the presence of a strong base. Disadvantages to
this process include, for example, that the strong base must
be neutralized to remove it from the end product, and that
certain aspects of the reaction must be carefully
