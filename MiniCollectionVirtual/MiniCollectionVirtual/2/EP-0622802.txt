<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor memory device includes a first 
RAM, a second RAM, a comparator, and an AND circuit. 

The first RAM simultaneously performs read and write 
operations in synchronism with a clock signal on the 

basis of write address data and read address data which 
is different from the write address data. The second 

RAM receives data identical to data input to the first 
RAM and simultaneously performs read and write 

operations in synchronism with a clock signal on the 
basis of write and read address data which are set 

independently of each other. The comparator compares 
read and write address data supplied to the second RAM 

and outputs a coincidence signal when the two address 
data coincide with each other. The AND circuit prevents 

destruction of stored data in the second RAM by stopping 
the input of a clock signal to the second RAM in 

accordance with the coincidence signal from the 
comparator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
semiconductor memory device constituted by a synchronous
RAM and, more particularly, to a semiconductor memory
device which is constituted by a plurality of
synchronous RAMs and capable of writing identical data
at arbitrary addresses and simultaneously reading a
plurality of data.In general, when data communication is to be
performed between remote areas, phase locking between
data is required. Fig. 3 illustrates a case wherein
data transmission is performed between areas A, B, and C
through a synchronous transmission network. In the
areas A, B, and C, data transmission is performed with
different phases. For this reason, when data is to be
transmitted from the area A to the area C via the area
B, a phase shift occurs. That is, the phase of the data
on the area A side is different from that of the data on
the area C side from the viewpoint of the area B.Fig. 4 shows a case wherein when a phase in
the area B is considered as a reference phase, the phase
of data a from the area A is shifted from the reference
phase by a phase 1, and the phase of data c to the area 
C is shifted from the reference phase by a phase 2. In
this case, there is a phase difference α = 2 - 1
between the data a from the area A and the data c to the
area C. For this reason, the positions of pointers
indicating the start data, of the respective data a and
c, which are indicated by the hatched portions in Fig. 4
differ from each other. Therefore, when the positions
of these two read pointers are different from each
other, the phase difference α between the data a and c
can be absorbed by correcting the phases of the two
data. For this purpose, the data exhibiting the phase
1 may be temporarily written in a memory, and an
address corresponding to the phase difference α may be
designated to read the data exhibiting the phase 92 from
the memory, thereby correcting the phase difference
between the phases 1 and 2.Fig. 5 shows a conventional semiconductor
memory device constituted by synchronous RAMs, which is
disclosed in Japanese Paten Laid-Open No. 5-100946.
This device is constituted by two two-port RAMs 21 and
22. Data inputs IN of the RAMs 21 and 22 are commonly
connected to a data input terminal 16. Second port
address inputs P2 of the RAMs 21 and 22 are commonly
connected to a write address terminal 18. First and
second port clock inputs CLK1 and CLK2 cf the RAMs 21
and 22 are commonly connected to a clock input terminal
20. A first port address input P1 of the RAM 21 is 
connected to a
