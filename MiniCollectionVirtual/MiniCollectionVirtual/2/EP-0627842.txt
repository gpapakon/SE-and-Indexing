<ABSTRACT>
An image pickup device comprises illuminating 
means for illuminating an object and an image pickup 

element for picking up an image of the object. An 
improvement is in that a drive circuit for driving the 

illuminating means and a control circuit for controlling 
the driving of the image pickup device are integrated 

with the image pickup device into one chip, in order to 
operate the image pickup device only a single power 

source and to minimize the device structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
pickup device for use as an image sensor for a copying
machine, a facsimile apparatus, a video camera or the
like, or a sensor for detecting the presence or absence
of a subject to be photographed or an object, and
particular to an image pickup device having a drive
circuit for illuminating means.Fig. 16 is a typical diagram showing a
conventional image pickup device, wherein a light
source 3 as illuminating means illuminates an object 1,
a reflected light from which is received by a solid
image pickup element 6 such as a CCD. Herein, 5 is a
lens as the optical system for illumination, and 4 is a
lens as the optical system for imaging, wherein the
light source 3 emits the light with a power supplied
from a power source 16 by means of a drive circuit 7.
On the other hand, the solid image pickup element 6 is
supplied with a power from another power source 15, and
driven by a drive circuit 8'. 8 is a controller for
controlling two drive circuits 7', 8' based on the
on/off of a power switch not shown. Of course, the
controller 8 itself is supplied with a power from a 
power source not shown.However, with the conventional devices, because
the light source 3 and the drive circuits 7', 8' for the
solid image pickup element 6 were constituted of
separate ICs, respectively, the number of wirings or
the packaging area was increased, which impeded the
reduction of apparatus size. And because the
controller 8 which was a control circuit was constituted
of still another IC, the further reduction of apparatus
size was impeded. And because the light source was
always lighted up, and the solid image pickup element
was driven only for a predetermined period of image
pickup, multiple voltage levels were required with
separate power sources 15, 16 provided.On the other hand, for the detection of a
minute object such as a medical camera, further
miniaturization is desired. Also, in the battery
driven apparatuses, it is desired to simplify the
power source and have lower consumption electric power. Moreover, document EP-0 456 451 A1 discloses an image reading
apparatus wherein a device for emitting light to an original is
provided in combination with a solid state image sensor (CCD
sensor) for receiving a light portion reflected from the
original (i.e. the object to be imaged), so that upon
generation of an electrical signal representing the object
image this information can be evaluated and processed. The
illumination of the object and the image reading process
carried out in the
