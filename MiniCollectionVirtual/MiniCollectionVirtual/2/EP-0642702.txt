<ABSTRACT>
A charging system (1) for a variety of batteries (nominal voltage, capacity, chemical components), stepping, and self-adjusting to the top-of-charge voltage of the battery (12a) by interacting with the terminal voltage of this battery in each one of a series of periodic intervals (steps). CONTROL means (2) are provided for enabling signals (4) in predetermined subintervals in each periodic interval, to control the charging process. The charging voltage parameter in the running periodic interval is set by REFERENCE VOLTAGE means (10), based on the sample of the terminal voltage of the battery taken by READING means (5) in the beginning of the running periodic interval and slightly amplified by a predetermined factor (25 %). Thereafter VOLTAGE REGULATOR means (15) regulate the voltage of the charging current according to, as this set, charging voltage parameter. Every time a sample of the terminal voltage of the battery is taken, COMPARATOR means (9) compare this sample with the one taken in the previous periodic interval and, then, the charging is proceeding when this comparison has a predetermined result (or alternately a combination or combinations of results from comparisons of more parameters), otherwise the charging process terminates.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to automatically regulated
battery charging systems for a variety of voltage, capacity and
chemistry types of batteries independently of their charging voltage characteristics, and more
particularly to a charging system that self-adjusts without any external support to
the different voltage and capacity type of the battery.As, it is non feasible for prior art chargers to recognize a
battery type only by the voltage that the battery is presenting
at its terminals and then accordingly, feed automatically every
different voltage/capacity type of battery, with the appropriate
electrical energy (amount of current under specific voltage),
these chargers are designed for predetermined battery types,
generally following two charging approaches:
a) mainly based on the capacity type of the batteries,
thereby being designed for sending some kind of constant or
quasi-constant amount of current of various forms (e.g. steady,
pulsed, variable duty cycle, trickle, etc.) within a certain range
related to the capacity type of the battery and the charging time
schedule design (C/rate) and wherein, in these chargers, it is
common practice that this constant or quasi-constant amount of
current is supplied under a high voltage so as to accommodate
different voltage type batteries, as long as they are of the same
capacity type (or within a confined capacity range), orb) mainly based on the voltage type of the batteries and
thereby being designed for allowing a high amount of current
under a constant voltage (including variations, such as with
current limitation, etc.) so that many capacity type batteries can
be accommodated, as long as they are of the same voltage type.There are some chargers and methods of charging
proposed in the prior art which claim to be capable of charging a
multiplicity of batteries like the ones disclosed in documents 
WO-A-93/05560 and US-A-5,157,320.US-A-5 157 320 discloses a battery charger with a
reference voltage generator which generates a reference
voltage equal to the battery voltage at the beginning of
charging. A comparitor compares the battery voltage with
the reference voltage and sends the result to a microprocessor.
If the battery voltage is greater than the
reference voltage the voltage generator is made to increase
the reference voltage by a predetermined increment.
If the battery voltage is equal to the reference
voltage for a predetermined time the system switches to
a trickle charge mode.WO-A-93/05560 discloses a battery charger which sequentially
