<ABSTRACT>
A branch joint box comprising: a casing (11) 
which is made of resin and includes a bottom wall (13); a 

plurality of connector blocks (15) which are provided on a 
front face of the bottom wall (13) and each include a 

plurality of terminals (17) erected from the front face of 
the bottom wall (13) such that distal ends (17a) of the 

terminals (17) are projected from a rear face of the bottom 
wall (13); and a sheetlike flexible printed circuit board 

(20) which is secured to the rear face of the bottom wall 
(13) and has a conductive pattern such that the distal 

ends (17a) of the terminals (17) are soldered to the 
conductive pattern of the flexible printed circuit 

board (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to branch
joint box used for branch connection of wiring harnesses of
a motor vehicle and more particularly, to a branch joint
box in which a plurality of connector blocks each having a
plurality of terminals are formed integrally with a bottom
wall such that the terminals are connected to each other by
a printed circuit board.A branch joint box in which a printed circuit
board is used for connecting terminals to each other is
known from, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication
Nos. 61-126783 (1986) and 63-265487 (1988) as shown in
Figs. 1 to 3. In Fig. 1, a plurality of connector blocks
3 are provided on an upper face of a bottom wall 2 of an
upper casing 1 of the branch joint box. In each of the
connector blocks 3, a plurality of pin type terminals 4 are
erected vertically on the upper face of the bottom wall 2.
A printed circuit board 5 for connecting the terminals 4 of
the connector blocks 3 is secured to a lower face of the
bottom wall 2 by screwing or resinous caulking.In Fig. 2, the connector blocks 3 are molded
integrally with the bottom wall 2 of the upper casing 1 by
resin and the bottom wall 2 serves also to support the
terminals 4 of the connector blocks 3. Each of the terminals
4 is inserted through the bottom wall 2 and the
printed circuit board 5 so as to project out of a lower 
face of the printed circuit board 5 and a distal end 4a of
the terminal 4, which projects out of the lower face of the
printed circuit board 5, is fixed to a conductive pattern
of the printed circuit board 5 by a solder portion A. The
printed circuit board 5 is generally produced by impregnating
a plain paper sheet with phenolic resin and hardening
the impregnated paper sheet to a thick platelike shape.
Meanwhile, the upper casing 1 is generally made of
polypropylene or the like and is reinforced by talc, etc.In addition to the above mentioned known branch
joint box shown in Figs. 1 to 3, Fig. 4 shows another
branch joint box in which a plurality of connector blocks
3 made of resin are provided separately from a thick
printed circuit board 5 so as to be secured to the printed
circuit board 5 by screws, etc.In the known branch joint box of Figs. 1 to 3 in
which the printed circuit board 5 obtained by hardening the
impregnated paper sheet to a platelike shape is secured to
the bottom wall 2 of the resinous upper casing 1 such that
wiring is performed among the terminals 4, coefficient of
thermal expansion of the resinous upper casing 1 is quite
higher, for example,
