<ABSTRACT>
There is described an intermediate sheet storing 
means which comprise: controlling and checking means (19) 

and signalling means (18) provided for the control of at 
least two groups of belt conveyors which embody a 

predetermined path provided for being followed by a sheet 
(4) during its handling. Particularly, the sheet (4) is 

forced to constantly take a curvilinear shape along the 
path, the same shape taken by the groups of belt 

conveyors. Moreover, the storing means comprises a first 
deverting element (16) and a second deverting element 

(17), each of these is arranged to take a first position 
that allows the sheet (4) to follow a predetermined path 

as far as a dwell position (15) and a second position 
that deverts the sheet from its path and send it or to a 

collecting cassette (6) or to an outlet slot (7) for 
returning it, respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to intermediate sheet 
storage means, in other words to a device for 
collecting sheets, particularly banknotes, for 
keeping or giving them back to an user. These 
storage means are generally inside equipments for 
accepting sheets and/or banknotes of different 
sizes, which are provided for automatic duties such 
as, for example, for dispensing tickets in railway 
and bus stations, for the gas deliver in automatic 
pumps of gas stations, etc.. As it is known, the above mentioned commercially 
available equipments basically consist of a body, 
wherein there is a sheet receiving device, an 
intermediate storing means connected to a sheet 
collecting cassette and a controlling and checking 
device provided for receiving instructions from an 
user, who wants to take advantage of the service 
provided by the equipments. In particular, the 
controlling and checking device is arranged to 
process the instructions received  
 
from the user, to send command signals to the 
receiving device, to the intermediate storage means 
and to one or more service dispensers connected to 
the equipment itself. The described equipments do not allow to stop the 
operation keyed on the keys of the controlling and 
checking device and the following recovery of the 
sheets or banknotes previously introduced, which are 
instead kept without delivering the service. Another disadvantage present in some of the 
previously equipments is that the sheets, along the 
path they follow inside the equipment itself, are 
mechanically stressed so that they are subjected to 
abrasions and also to tearings in addition to 
relative slidings with consequent misalignments 
which restrict the correct handling of the sheets 
collected in the intermediate storage means. Moreover, it occurs that the several passages of the 
sheets on sensors located in the equipment cause a 
decrease of their operation due to the presence of 
ink, dust or other substances present on the sheets 
and released on the sensors themselves. In particular, the Applicant is aware of the German 
patent N. 2619620, wherein there are described 
storage means for a short term collection of paper  
 
sheets. These storage means provide that the sheets, 
already stacked, are held in a packets between belt 
conveyors and are slided back and forward. The mentioned storage means show the shortcoming of 
mechanically stressing the sheets because of the 
relative movement of the belts. This is due to the 
fact that the sheets must follow a fairly long 
str
