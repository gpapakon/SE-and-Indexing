<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved process for
urea production, as well as to a method for retrofitting
pre-existing urea production plants in which a reaction
mixture leaving an urea synthesis reactor is submitted to
a stripping step with carbon dioxide (Stamicarbon
process).The invention also relates to a plant for implementing
the above mentioned process.As is well known, the need often arise of increasing the
urea production capacity of a pre-existing plant.To this end, various methods of enhancing the production
capacity have been proposed heretofore, such as that
described in European Patent application EP-A-0 479 103
by the same Applicant.EP-A-0 479 103 discloses a process wherein highly pure
ammonia and carbon dioxide are reacted in a first high-yield
"once-through" reactor, the reaction mixture thus
obtained is fed to a recovery section and a synthesis
reaction between less pure reagents, substantially
recycled from the recovery section (recovery mixture), is
carried out in the pre-existing reactor of conventional
type. In European patent application EP 0 497 215, the
Applicant has described an embodiment of the process
according to European application EP 0 479 103, wherein a
first part of the urea recovery section comprises two
decomposition stages operating in series.Each decompcsition stage consists of a decomposer (heat
exchangers for the distillation of reagents not
transformed into urea), yielding gas effluents
substantially consisting of NH3+CO2+H2O, which are fed to
a condensation system with direct heat recovery from the
process where the parcial condensation of said effluents
is carried out and then completed in a fractionating
column with a head condenser.In copending Swiss application 01477/92-0, the problem of
increasing the urea production capacity and reducing
energy consumptions in pre-existing plants according to
the Stamicarbon Process (STC), i.e. including a CO2
stripping section, is addressed by carrying out urea 
synthesis in the first high-yield reactor in adiabatic
conditions (in a so-called "Vulcan" reactor) and by
distilling the reaction mixture leaving the Vulcan
reactor so as to obtain unreacted ammonia and carbamate
streams recycled respectively to the Vulcan reactor
itself and to the pre-existing low-yield reactor.The process thus achieved appeared to-date to be
satisfactory and further improvements did not seem to be
possible.Continuing his research and experiments, however, the
Applicant was able to develop a new perfected revamping
process applicable
