<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polyacetal resin compositions
having excellent weather (light) resistant properties. More
specifically, an acrylic series resin, a specific oxyalkylene
polymer, a UV absorber and two kinds of specific hindered
amine series light stabilizers are used in combination with a
polyacetal resin to provide a polyacetal resin composition
having very excellent weather resistance and environment
resistance, which suppresses resin deterioration/discoloration
and crack formation due to exposure to light over an
extended period of time and discoloration caused by additive
bleeding. The initial molded product surface condition is
thereby maintained.As known well, in recent years, polyacetal resin has been
utilized in a very wide field as an engineering resin due to its
excellent physical characteristics such as its mechanical and
electrical properties and its chemical characteristics such as
its chemical resistance and a heat resistance properties.
However, expansion of the field in which the polyacetal resin
is utilized is accompanied with further requirements of a
specific material property changes. Further improvement in
weather (light) resistance is desired as one of such specific
property changes. For example, the environment in which the interior and
exterior parts for automobiles and the parts for electric
appliances are used under conditions of sun light, humidity
(rain and bedewing) and other aerial contaminants cause
discoloration of molded product surfaces and gloss
reduction attributable to loss of surface flatness. In addition,
such an environment generates cracks on the surfaces of
such parts thereby causing damage to their appearance.This necessitates the use of a composition blended with
various anti-weather stabilizers when the polyacetal resin is
used for parts exposed to sun light. Various blends of
anti-weather stabilizers are known. For example, there are
proposed combined use of a hindered amine series light
stabilizer and various UV absorbers (JP-A-5798545,
JP-A-59-133245, JP-A-60-195155 and JP-A-6136339) and
combined use of various UV absorbers, aliphatic ester and a
hindered amine series light stabilizer (JP-A-61-47744).However, the methods with these stabilizers can not
necessarily be satisfied, and in order to maintain a weather
(light) resistance over a long period of time, a large number of
such stabilizers must be added. Since polyacetal resin is a
high crystalline polymer, the additives tend to bleed due to
recrystallization caused by heat and temperature
