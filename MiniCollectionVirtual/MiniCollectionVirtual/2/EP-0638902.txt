circuit having a power circuit producing an internal power 

voltage lower than an external power voltage and including a 
reference voltage generator generating a reference voltage and 

a voltage source circuit responding to the reference voltage and 
supplying the internal power voltage to a memory cell array. The

terminal pad and an output line connected to the voltage source 
circuit, the terminal pad being supplied with a test voltage in 

a test mode of the memory circuit and brought into an open state 
in a normal operation mode of the memory circuit. The selector 

circuit responds the voltage at the second input node and forms 
an electrical path between the first input node and the output 

line in the test mode and between the second input node and the 
output line in the normal operation mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a selector circuit employed
in a semiconductor integrated circuit device and, more
particularly, to a selector circuit employed in a semiconductor
memory device having a power circuit responding to an external
power supply voltage applied to the device and generating an
internal power voltage lower than the external power supply
voltage.The increase in memory capacity of a semiconductor memory
device has been accelerated more and more. In accordance with
the increase in the memory capacity, an internal circuit of the
memory device is required to operate on a voltage lower than an
external power supply voltage applied to the device in order to
lower power consumption and enhance reliability thereof. For
this purpose, the recent memory device incorporates therein a
power circuit which responds to the external power supply voltage
and generates an internal power voltage lower than the external
power supply voltage.The power circuit incorporated into the memory device is in
turn required to generate the internal power voltage stabilized
against the variation of the external power supply voltage. For
this purpose, the power circuit includes a reference voltage
generator generating a reference voltage by utilizing threshold
voltages of MOS transistors. Although the threshold voltage of
the MOS transistor is stabilized against the variation of the 
external power supply voltage, it is influenced by the
manufacturing process of the transistor and thus deviated from
the designed value. Accordingly, the power circuit further
includes a voltage regulator coupled to the reference voltage
generator to regulate the reference voltage therefrom.Referring to Fig. 1, a reference voltage generator 40
according to the prior art employed in a power circuit of a
memory device includes a reference circuit 39 and a voltage
regulator 30. The reference circuit 39 generates a reference
voltage by utilizing the threshold voltages of MOS transistors
(not shown), as described above, and supplies it to an input node
32 of the regulator 30 which includes an operational amplifier
31, a P-channel MOS transistor Q5 and resistors R2 and R3
connected as shown. As each of the resistors R2 and R3 is
denoted as a variable resistor in Fig. 1, accordingly, a
regulated reference voltage is derived from an output node 33 of
the regulator 30 by adjusting the resistance values of the
resistors R2 and/or R3.It is of course impossible to form the variable resistor on
the semiconductor chip. Accordingly, each of the
