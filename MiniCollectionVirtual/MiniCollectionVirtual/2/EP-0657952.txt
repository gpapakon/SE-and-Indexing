<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a relatively
large rectangular sealed alkaline storage battery and a
module battery comprising the collected storage
batteries.At present, as for large storage batteries,
lead acid storage batteries are used as batteries for
SLI of automobiles and stationary batteries. As
electric sources for small home equipments, nickel-cadmium
storage batteries are used and recently,
alkaline storage batteries such as nickel-metal hydride
storage batteries superior in energy density have
spread.In recent years, environmental disruption has
rapidly advanced on a global scale and as one cause
thereof, waste gases from automobiles have become a
problem. In order to cope with the problem, development
of electric cars has been hastened and development of
electric sources holds the key to the attainment of the
development of the electric cars.As these driving electric sources, lead acid
storage batteries are mainly used at present. However, 
since the lead acid storage batteries are low in energy
density per unit weight, one charge distance range is
very short. Furthermore, since these batteries are of
an open type, troublesome maintenance such as electrolyte
addition are needed. Furthermore, nickel-cadmium
storage batteries or nickel-iron storage batteries high
in energy density and long in one charge distance range
are also partially used as electric sources for electric
cars, but these storage batteries are also not of a
sealed type and need troublesome maintenance such as
electrolyte addition.From the viewpoint of safety, too, sealed
batteries which require a minimum amount of an
electrolyte are desired.On the other hand, since the internal pressure
of sealed alkaline storage batteries increases owing to
the gas generated at the time of charging and
discharging, a safety vent is provided at the sealed
container and when this safety vent operates and mist of
electrolyte is released outside together with the gas,
the battery capacity decreases due to decrease of the
amount of an electrolyte.To solve these problems and realize increase
of one charge distance range and maintenance-free
batteries, development of new storage batteries of a
high energy and completely sealing type is demanded.The above storage batteries when subjected to
charging and discharging cause expansion and shrinkage 
of electrodes. When the structure is of rectangular
sealed type, the group of expanded electrodes is pressed
by the container wall to cause distortion of plates and
the distance between the facing plates
