<ABSTRACT>
A business form (10) has a self-contained ID card 
(19) which is mounted in such a way that the form has 

uniform thickness and can readily pass through an impact or 
non-impact printer, and indicia can be applied to both the 

top (25) and bottom (35) faces of the ID card by the 
printer. A first sheet (11) has a first cutout (22) and a 

first thickness, and an ID card (19) of the same shape and 
slightly less dimensions, and about the same thickness, is 

disposed within the cutout. The card is held in the cutout 
by a backing (27; 60, 61) overlapping at least part of the 

first cutout with readily releasable adhesive 936) disposed 
on the top face (28) of the backing overlapping the cutout 

and engaging the bottom of the card. The backing may be 
first and second parallel pieces of tape (60, 61), or it 

may be second sheet (27) with a second die cut out (31) in 
substantial alignment with the first cutout but having 

lesser dimensions.

<DESCRIPTION>
There are many uses for ID cards, and it is becoming
increasingly popular in the manufacture of business forms
to mount one or more ID cards on a form that is mailed to
a recipient. While significant amounts of pre-printed,
non-variable, data may be provided on the ID card and
mounting form, it is also highly desirable to provide at
least some variable data on the ID card and/or surrounding
form.In the construction of forms of the general type as
described above, it is highly desirable to be able to use
the form with both impact and non-impact printers with
minimum amount of difficulties, and to be able to print the
ID card with variable information on both the top and
bottom faces thereof.EP-A-0580280, having an earlier priority date than the
present application but published after the priority date
of the present application, discloses several forms of card
assembly. Although in EP-A-0580280 a card is located in a
cut out in a first sheet and is secured therein by adhesive
on a backing, the backing is a continuous sheet, although
preferably of transparent material, so that it completely 
covers the bottom face of the card and prevents printing
thereon.According to the present invention a business form,
and method of production thereof, are provided which have
the desirable attributes described above. In particular
the business form according to the present invention has
substantially uniform thickness throughout, allowing it to
pass easily through impact and non-impact printers without
hangups. Also, because of the uniform thickness the
business form according to the invention reduces or
eliminates uneven pads which develop in conventional ID
carrier business forms where a card is directly affixed to
(on top of) the surface of the carrier. Also, the
construction and method according to the invention allow
duplex printing (that is both the top and bottom faces) of
the card with variable information by the output printer.Accordingly in one aspect the present invention
provides a business form comprising:
a first sheet having top and bottom faces;means defining a first cutout in said first sheet
having a substantially quadrate configuration with first
length and width dimensions, and a first thickness;a card having a substantially quadrate configuration
with given second length and width dimensions, slightly
less than said respective first length and width
dimensions, and having a thickness substantially the same
as said first thickness;said card disposed in said first cutout and having top 
and bottom
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A business form (10) comprising:

a first sheet (11) having top and bottom faces (12,
13);
means defining a first cutout (22) in said first
sheet having a substantially quadrate configuration with

first length and width dimensions (20, 21), and a first
thickness;
a card (19) having a substantially quadrate
configuration with given second length and width

dimensions (23, 24), slightly less than said respective
first length and width dimensions, and having a thickness

substantially the same as said first thickness;
said card disposed in said first cutout and having
top and bottom faces (25, 35);
a backing (27; 60, 61) overlapping a part only of
said first cutout on the bottom face of said first sheet,

said backing having a top face (28) facing said cutout,
and a bottom face (29) facing away from said cutout; and
readily releasable adhesive (36), which will readily
release said card, disposed on said top face (28) of said

backing overlapping said cutout, so that said card is
held in said cutout by said readily releasable adhesive

with said card top face (25) substantially flush with
said first sheet top face (12), but with parts of the

bottom face of said card uncovered by the backing so that
it can receive printing.
A business form as recited in claim 1 characterised
in that said backing includes or consists 

solely of first and second, preferably parallel, pieces of
tape (60, 61) having adhesive (63) disposed on

substantially the entire top face thereof, and overlapping
different portions of said first cutout.
A business form as recited in claim 1
characterised in that said backing comprises a second sheet

(27), said second sheet having a second cutout therein in
substantial alignment with said first cutout, said second

cutout having third length and width dimensions (31, 32) at
least one of which is significantly less than said first

dimensions (20, 21), so as to provide a portion (34) of
said second sheet overlapping said first sheet at said

first cutout; said readily releasable adhesive (36)
disposed on said overlapping portion of said second sheet.
A business form as recited in claim 3
characterised in that both said third length and width

dimensions (31, 32) are less than said first dimensions
(20, 21), so that said overlapping portion of said second

sheet comprises a generally quadrate frame (34).
A business form as recited in claim 3 or claim 4
characterised in that said adhesive (36) holds said first

and second sheets (11, 27) laminated together along the
majority of said bottom and top faces thereof,

respectively.
A business form as recited in any of claims 1 to
5 characterised in that said card comprises an ID card

having indicia imaged on said top face or both the top and

bottom faces. 
A business form as recited in any of claims 1 to 6
characterised in that said first sheet (11) is paper, and

said card (19) consists essentially of paper or plastic.
A method of producing a business form from a first
sheet and backing, each having top and bottom faces,

comprising the steps of:

(a) making a first quadrate die cut opening in the
first sheet, having first length and width dimensions;
(b) applying repositional adhesive to the top face
of at least a portion of the backing;
(c) providing the backing in juxtaposition to the
first sheet so that a portion of the backing having

repositional adhesive overlaps at least part of the
bottom face of the first sheet and a part only of the

first die cut opening; and
(d) inserting a quadrate card having top and bottom
face, and second length and width dimensions slightly

less than the first length and width dimensions, in the
first quadrate die cut opening, so that the card is held

in the opening by the repositional adhesive with part of
the bottom face of the card uncovered.
A method as recited in claim 8 characterised in that
the backing is a second sheet, and comprising the further

step of forming a second die cut opening in the second
sheet having third length and width dimensions one or

both of which is/are less than the corresponding first
length and width dimension; and wherein step (c) is

practiced by substantially aligning the centers of the
first and second die cut openings.
A method as recited in claim 8 characterised in 
that the backing comprises first and second strips of tape;

and wherein step (c) is practiced by placing the first and
second strips of tape, preferably parallel to one another,

into contact with the bottom face of the first sheet so
that portions of the top face of the tape pieces overlaps

different edges of the first die cut opening.
A method as recited in any of claims 8 to 11
characterised in that the card has approximately the same

thickness as the first sheet; and wherein step (d) is
practiced so as to position the card so that a top face

thereof is substantially flush with the top face of the
first sheet.
