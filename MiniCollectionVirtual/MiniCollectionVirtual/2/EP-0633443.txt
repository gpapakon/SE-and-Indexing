<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to production of
cryogenic aerosol and, more particularly, to surface cleaning
using a cryogenic aerosol.Surface contamination is a widespread concern in many
industries. Such contamination can result in production of
inferior or non-operating products, or considerably lower
product yields. For instance, as a specific example, surface
contamination is a prevalent problem in the microelectronics
processing industry, and can take the form of unwanted
particles, films, molecules, or the like; and the surfaces
that can be contaminated include those of semiconductor
wafers, displays, microelectronic components, etc.
Contamination of these surfaces can cause various types of
defects to develop, including short circuits, open circuits,
stacking faults, among others. These defects can adversely
affect circuits, and ultimately cause entire chips to fail.Another type of surface that has contaminants that are
required to be removed are the walls of tool or processing
chambers, such as plasma etch and chemical vapor deposition
reactors. Reaction residues and/or polymers generated during
semiconductor processing tend to deposit on the chamber walls.
These residues and/or polymers can subsequently flake off onto
products being processed or onto subsequently processed
products. In order to prevent yield loss due to this
mechanism, manufacturing processing chambers have to be
disassembled periodically to be cleaned or "wiped down".
Current practice involves weekly disassembly of the fixtures
inside the chamber and wipe down of all the surfaces with a
mixture of alcohol and water. This periodic machine
disassembly, wipe down, and re-assembly, and the required long 
pump-down times after cleaning for surface drying, severely
reduces the production and reliability of the processing
equipment. In addition, the acidic fumes formed when the
deposited material reacts with water often creates a health
hazard for cleaning personnel.U.S. Patent No. 5,108,512, issued April 28, 1992, to
Goffnett et al., relates to cleaning a chemical vapor
deposition reactor used in the production of polycrystalline
silicon by impacting with carbon dioxide pellets. Goffnett et
al. discloses delivering carbon dioxide gas to a pelletizer
where the gas is compressed and formed into solid carbon
dioxide pellets. The pellets, along with an accelerant gas
for increasing the velocity of the pellets, are delivered to
a nozzle. The nozzle is a "venturi" nozzle which maximizes
the velocity at which the pellets are
