<ABSTRACT>
An improved solenoid driver control circuit is 
disclosed in which solenoid current is sensed and 

provided as an input to a comparator means comprising two 
separate comparators (24, 25). The comparator means 

receives a solenoid current sense signal (45) and maximum 
and minimum reference threshold levels which determine 

maximum and minimum current limits (I
max
, I
min
;.H
max
, H
min
) for 
solenoid current during initial

 
pull-in excitation and subsequent hold excitation. 

Pull-in time (T₁) is defined by a monostable 
multivibrator (33) reacting to a control pulse (41) to 

produce a predetermined pull-in time pulse (43) such that 
the pull-in time is independent of sensed solenoid 

current. During pull-in time a boost driver switch (53) 
applies high boost voltage to a power source terminal 

(16) which supplies solenoid current, and in response to 
achieving the maximum pull-in current limit (I
max
) 
lower battery voltage is provided at the power source 

terminal. If the maximum pull-in current limit does not 
occur within a predetermined time (t
b1
) after pull-in 
initiation (at t₀), then the lower battery voltage is 

applied to the power source terminal at that time. The 
above configuration insures rapid initial solenoid 

response while minimizing power dissipation and circuit 
stress.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to the invention 
described in U.S.-A-4764840, 
entitled "Dual Limit 
Solenoid Driver Control Circuit," by Adelore F. Petrie, 
Thomas Karlmann, Steven Parmelee and Arthur J. Edwards, 
having the same assignee as the present invention. The present invention is related to inductor current 
controllers, and more specifically to solenoid current 
controllers. It is generally desirable to implement actuation of 
a solenoid by providing an initial or pull-in period of 
time during which a maximum first current is effectively 
passed through the solenoid inductor to achieve initial 
actuation of the solenoid. Subsequently, a smaller 
magnitude solenoid current is implemented so as to  
 
maintain actuation of the solenoid wherein this occurs 
during a subsequent holding or hold period of time (as is 
described, for example, in GB-A-2025183 or US-A-4173030). In 
this manner, the efficiency of the solenoid controller is 
increased since only the minimum necessary holding 
current is utilized by the solenoid for maintaining 
solenoid actuation whereas a high pull-in or actuation 
current is initially permitted to insure the rapid 
response of the solenoid to a solenoid actuation control 
pulse. Many prior circuits have implemented the general 
features of the solenoid current control system discussed 
above. Some of these systems determine the pull-in time, 
during which a high value of solenoid current can be 
drawn, by use of a monostable multivibrator. These 
systems typically utilize additional monostable 
multivibrators for implementing cycling of the solenoid 
current about a first high effective current pull-in 
level and then about a low holding current level. This 
cycling is implemented by essentially opening and closing 
the connection between the solenoid coil and a power 
supply. During the pull-in period solenoid current 
varies between maximum and minimum initial (pull-in) high 
current levels, and during the holding current period 
solenoid current varies between maximum and minimum lower 
holding current levels. The above referred-to copending 
U.S. application describes a similar system except direct 
control of the maximum/minimum current levels of the 
solenoid current is implemented by the use of separate 
maximum and minimum comparators which receive separate 
pull-in and hold thresholds during the pull-in and hold 
times, respectively. This results in more accurately 
controlling the magnitude of solenoid current. In some prior systems, in addition to
