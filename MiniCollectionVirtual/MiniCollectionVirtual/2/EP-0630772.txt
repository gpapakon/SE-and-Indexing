<ABSTRACT>
This device is intended for a vehicle whose wheels (1) are each equipped with a damper (2) and with a suspension spring (3); it comprises, for each wheel, a control cylinder (4) interacting with the spring and provided with a position sensor (5), an electrohydraulic interface (6) for operating the control cylinder, connected to the latter, to a hydraulic source (8) of the vehicle and to a source of electrical energy, and an attitude-management computer (7) connected to the interfaces, programmed to take account of each parameter of the driving of the vehicle, especially its speed and the angle of its steering wheel; on the basis of these parameters the computer controls the interfaces (6) and the control cylinders in the context of control loops slaving the control cylinders to reference extension travels corresponding to keeping the vehicle in predetermined attitudes which have been stored in the memory of the computer. This attitude system makes it possible to prevent rolling and pitching (diving) under acceleration, braking and cornering, without impairing the comfort of the occupants.

Position-control device for a four-wheeled vehicle (1),
each wheel being equipped with a shock-absorber (2) disposed

in parallel with a suspension spring (3), and with a
position jack (4) co-operating in series with said

suspension spring, and provided with a position detector (5)
indicating the position of the jack, characterised in that

it comprises, for each wheel, and electrohydraulic control
interface (6) of the jack, connected on the one hand to the

latter and on the other hand to a central hydraulic system
(8) of the vehicle, and to a source of electrical power, and

a dynamic position-management computer (7) connected to the
interfaces, programmed to take into account each parameter

of the vehicle drive, particularly the speed and the angle
of its steering wheel, and on the basis of the parameters to

control the electrohydraulic interfaces and, consecutively,

the jacks within the scope of servo loops of these latter,
to reference output tracks, corresponding to maintaining the

vehicle in predetermined positions, for different situations
stored in the memory of the computer, in that said

interfaces (6) are controlled by an "all or nothing" signal
(S) of a determined period (T) modulated in width and

provided by the computer (7), and in that each jack (4) is
hydraulic and single-acting, its travel being subject to a

reference position.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
electrohydraulic interfaces are electrovalves (27).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
electrohydraulic interfaces are servovalves.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
suspension spring is hydropneumatic.
