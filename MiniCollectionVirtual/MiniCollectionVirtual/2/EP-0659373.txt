<ABSTRACT>
In feather comforters and other comforters 
(primarily coverlet comforters) having a heat insulating 

material filled therein, to provide an air controlled 
comforter which makes it possible to obtain good sleep 

under comfortable sleeping conditions in terms of both 
temperature and humidity with the aid of warm or cool air, 

and which will not be moisturized itself so as to be free 
from the need of drying it each time after use. In a 

comforter in which a front cloth (1) and a rear cloth (2) 
is joined together at their peripheral edges to form a 

shape of bag, where a heat insulating material such as 
feather, wool, and cotton is filled in the bag, an air-permeable 

cloth (3) is joined with the rear cloth to define 
an air passage (4) ranging from hem to center part of the 

comforter. The air passage (4) is opened at the hem of the 
comforter, where an air opening (7) is provided for feeding 

warm or cool air. The warm or cool air fed through the 
opening to the air passage is passed through the sleeping 

space and the interior of the comforter with the heat 
insulating mat
erial filled therein, whereby a low-humidity, 
comfortable-temperature sleeping space is created while the 

comforter itself is dried.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to comforters in
which a front cloth and a rear cloth are joined together at
their peripheral edges into a shape of bag (on comforter
side) and an interior wad such as feather, wool, and cotton
(hereinafter, referred to as heat insulating material) is
filled in the bag. More particularly, the invention
relates to an air controlled comforter which can create a
comfortable sleeping environment by feeding warm or cool
air to the interior of the comforter.Conventionally, there have been unavailable
comforters that can be controlled in temperature or
humidity. It has been usual practice in cold districts to
use electric blankets, kotatsu, foot warmers, and the like.
Known as the technique for warming a comforter itself with
the aid of warm air are a concept of piping an air tube and
a suction tube made of rubber tubes into the bed (Japanese
Patent Publication SHO 40-16512), a concept of feeding warm
air to an airtight bag-like body made of vinyl chloride
resin or the like to effectuate heating (Japan Utility 
Model Publication SHO 43-21375, Japan Utility Model
Publications SHO 43-21378 to -21380), and the like.The document US-A-2 110 022 discloses a quilt made up of an upper
layer of insulating material and an lower layer of porous heat conducting
material with a flat bag of flexible material therebetween.
The two layers are spaced by a suitable filling material such as
loose cotton or the like. Thus the last mentioned document discloses
a comforter according to the the preambles of the independend claims
of the present invention.Conventional known comforters utilizing warm air
are in all cases those designed for heating only, such that
they could not be applied to coverlet comforters using a
heat insulating material (wad). For example, comforters
formed from a bag-like body of vinyl chloride resin have no
moisture absorption property and could not afford to obtain
a soft texture of coverlet comforters using a heat
insulating material (wad) such as feather or wool.
Further, since one discharges out a large amount of
moisture (sweat) during sleep, increasing only the bed
temperature would result in an overhumidity state in the
bed due to the moisture discharged by himself or herself,
so that he or she could not have a comfortable sleep.According to the studies of the present
inventors, it has been proved that the most comfortable
sleeping conditions are a bed temperature of 31Â°C and a
humidity of 35 to 45%. In view of these circumstances, the
present invention has come up with an
