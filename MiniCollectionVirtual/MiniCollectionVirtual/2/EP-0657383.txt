<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
preparing silicon carbide powder from vaporized
polysiloxanes. This process is characterized in that our
polysiloxane is reacted and pyrolyzed to form the SiC powder
in a single step. The powder produced by this process,
moreover, is desirable in that it is non-agglomerated and
can be densified to form silicon carbide bodies.Silicon carbide ceramics have utility in numerous
applications because of their desirable properties and
characteristics. The production of such ceramics, however,
requires silicon carbide powder which is inexpensive, pure
and in a form which can be easily sintered to a ceramic.Silicon carbide powder is produced by a number of
known techniques using a variety of silicon containing
compounds. For example, SiC can be formed by vapor phase
pyrolysis of alkylated silanes (Canadian Patent 592,456);
mixtures of silicon halides and hydrocarbon gases (US
Patents 3,346,338 and 4,295,890); and polysilanes (US
Patents 4,676,966 and 4,571,331). Silicon carbide can also
be formed by the reaction of silica and carbon or by the
pyrolysis of a variety of non-vapor phase organosilicon
polymers, such as polysiloxanes (US Patent 4,840,781);
polycarbosilanes (US Patent 4,465,647); and polysilanes (US
Patent 4,534,948). However, the use of vaporized
polysiloxanes for forming the SiC powder is not taught in
these references.US Patent 4,613,490 teaches a process for forming
SiC powder in which a polysiloxane undergoes a vapor phase
reaction to form a SiCO product at a temperature less than
1600°C. that is then heated (calcined) to form the resultant 
powder. This process is time consuming and expensive
because it requires a second heat (calcining) step to form
the powder. Additionally, the powder prepared by this 2-step
process is often highly agglomerated and is difficult
to densify.The present invention is a process as set forth in claim 1.The present invention is based on our unexpected
finding that silicon carbide powder can be formed by a
single-step vapor-phase reaction and pyrolysis of a
polysiloxane. This is particularly surprising since the
prior art taught that the SiC derived from a polysiloxane
required an additional pyrolysis step. Avoiding this second
step provides substantial savings in both time and capital
in our process.In addition, the SiC powder produced by our
process has characteristics such as desirable size
distributions (without grinding), morphology, high purity
and a good densification profile. This was also unexpected
since
