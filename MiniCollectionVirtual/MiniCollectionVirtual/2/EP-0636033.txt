<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for producing active agent complexes from at least one initial complex having components in which the initial complex is caused at least partially to assume a homogeneous phase by means of a denaturing process and by being broken into its components, said phase having at least partially the components with an at least partially altered structure. By means of a renaturing process, a final complex is formed from at least one predetermined component together with at least one part of the homogeneous phase. Said final complex forms the active agent complex after at least one cycle consisting of a denaturing and renaturing process. The process of the invention provides active agent complexes, the effect of which can be triggered at the desired place and for a desired time even when short-lived active agents are used in a living organism.
