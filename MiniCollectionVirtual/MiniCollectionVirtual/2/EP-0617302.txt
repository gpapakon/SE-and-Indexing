<ABSTRACT>
A device in which each optical fiber (4) extends beyond 
a free end of a protecting tube (5). The device comprises a 

removable tubular protective sleeve (8) passed over the bare 
part of the fiber and slipped over an adjacent part of the 

tube (5) in order to be held back by friction on it and to 
protect the bare part of the fiber (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical device with 
optical fibers extending beyond a free end of protective 
tubes, and a protective sleeve for such a device. For installing telecommunication networks with optical 
fibers, it has been proposed to use approximately 
parallelepiped cassettes conceived to protect and to allow 
handling of optical components such as, for example, a 1xN 
coupler embodied in integrated optics. The optical fibers connected to such a component extend 
out of the cassette together and are partially protected, 
outside the cassette, by flexible tubes, each one wrapping one 
fiber, on part of its length only. The free end of each fiber 
preferably extends beyond the free end of each associated tube 
so it can be connected to other optical components or fibers. 
However, before undertaking this connecting operation, this 
part of the fiber must be protected, as it is particularly 
fragile when its end is bared and prepared in order to prevent 
parasitic reflections. One could extend the protective tube to the end of the 
fiber and just before a connecting operation, shortening the 
tube without touching the fiber, by a specialized cutting 
tool. The disadvantage is that the protective tube makes the  
 
fiber inaccessible and prevents any test or optical checking 
before baring the fiber. Moreover, the fiber end face is usually cut at a 10° ± 1° 
angle for example, from a plane normal to the axis of the 
fiber, in order that an optical signal arriving on this face 
can't be reflected on the face inside the fiber following the 
fiber axis and thus disturb the functioning of the optical 
component to which the fiber is connected when in active mode. 
Great care must be taken to avoid the deposition of any 
pollutant product (water, dust, etc...) on this end face, that 
would again produce the undesirable reflection. The present invention has therefore as its aim to provide 
a device with optical fibers incorporating means for 
protecting the fibers which does not present this drawback and 
ensures adequate protection for these fibers against 
pollutants and to provide a protective sleeve for the fibers 
in such device. These and other objects of the invention, appearing from 
the description, are achieved with an optical device provided 
with at least one optical fiber passing through a protective 
tube and extending beyond a free end of this tube, which 
comprises a removable tubular protective sleeve passed over 
the bare part of the fiber and slipped over an adjacent part 
of

<CLAIMS>
An optical device provided with at least one optical 
fiber (4) passing through a protective tube (5) and extending 

beyond a free end of this tube, characterized in that it 
comprises a removable tubular protective sleeve (8) passed 

over the bare part of the fiber and slipped over an adjacent 
part of the tube (5) in order to be held back by friction on 

it and to protect the said bare part of the fiber (4). 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
free end of the fiber is cut following a face (4') angled over 

the axis of the fiber (4), in order to prevent any reflection 
of optical signals inside the fiber following the fiber axis. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that a stop (10) is placed on the protective 

tube (5) of the fiber (4) in order to stop the end of the part 
of the protective sleeve (8) that is slipped over the tube (5) 

in a predetermined position. 
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
stop (10) is removable. 
A device according to any one of claims 2 to 4, where 
optical signals circulate in the fiber (4) protected by the 

protective sleeve (8).

the device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 

characterized in that it is constituted by a flexible tubular 
component (8) with a greater length than that of the bare part 

of the fiber and with an inner diameter complementary to the 
outer diameter of the protective tube (5).
