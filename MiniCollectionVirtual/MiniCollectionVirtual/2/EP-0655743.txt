<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an integrated circuit for
the programming of a memory cell in a non-volatile memory
register.Non-volatile memory registers are commonly used in memory
device chips to implement redundancy. In such applications,
address configurations corresponding to defective memory
elements in the memory array of the memory device are stored in
said non-volatile registers during the in-factory device
testing, so that the defective memory elements can be replaced
by redundant memory elements. In this way the manufacturing
process yield is greatly improved. The memory registers must be
non-volatile, since they must retain the information stored
therein even in absence of the power supply, and not accessible
to the end user. Depending on the particular kind of memory
device, and on the manufacturing process, fuses or electrically
programmable MOS transistors may be utilized as non-volatile
memory elements for the memory registers.In general, redundancy provides for the existence of both
rows and columns of redundant memory elements; each redundant
row or column has an associated non-volatile register. A
defective memory element in the memory matrix can be replaced
by a redundant memory element by substituting either the matrix
row or matrix column to which it belongs with a redundant row
or column, respectively; this requires that the defective row
or column address is stored during testing in a non-volatile
register, which, in consequence, must be made up of a number of
cells equal to the number of bits in the row or column address 
bus.During the memory device operation, each non-volatile
memory register performs a comparison between the address
configuration stored in it and the address currently supplied
to the memory device and, if a matching occurs, the selection
of the defective row or column is inhibited and in substitution
the selection of the redundant row or column is enabled.According to a known circuital solution, adopted to
implement redundancy in a Flash EEPROM device, each register
cell comprises two programmable non-volatile memory elements,
represented by two electrically erasable and programmable MOS
transistors, connected to respective load transistors in latch
configuration. The register cell further comprises a program
load circuit comprising two pairs of selection transistors, the
transistors in each pair being connected in series between a
high voltage supply and a respective programmable MOS
transistor. A first transistor in each pair is controlled by a
first
