<ABSTRACT>
A low pressure monitor for hybrid air bag systems for 
vehicles includes a pressure responsive disc 34.6 exposed on one 

side to a reference pressure chamber 34.11 and on the other side 
to the pressure in an air bag bottle 40 and positioned adjacent a 

movable arm 28.10 of an electric switch. The switch includes an 
electrically conductive sheet having a first portion partially 

encased in a base 26 of electrically insulative material and 
being connected to a first terminal 14 and a second portion 

forming the movable contact arm 28.10 extending from the 
insulative material and culminating with a portion formed with 

contact rib 28.14 adapted to be received beneath a laterally 
extending stationary contact portion 22 of a second terminal 16. 

Tabs 28.4, 28.6 extend from the sheet out of the insulative 
material for connection to a resistor 30 mounted on the 

electrically insulative base and a frangible portion 28.7 of the 
first portion is severed to place the resistor in series with the 

electrical contacts. The monitor is disposed in an air bag 
bottle with the disc 34.6 adapted to snap from one dished 

configuration to an opposite dished configuration whenever the 
pressure on the bottle decreases to a selected level. The 

movement of the snapping of the disc is transferred to the 
movable arm 28.10 separating the contact rib 28.14 from the 

stationary contact portion 22 opening the circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for monitoring gas 
pressure levels in an enclosed chamber and more specifically to 
apparatus for monitoring a pressurized gas used in hybrid air bag 
systems for motor vehicles. The use of air bags for drivers as well as passengers in 
motor vehicles is becoming more and more widespread. Earlier 
versions of air bag systems made use of pyrotechnic inflators in 
which a rapid oxidation of sodium azide causes the air bags to 
inflate in a very short period of time, i.e., approximately 40 to 
45 milliseconds. Sodium azide, however, is hazardous in 
processing. The material is toxic to unprotected workers and is 
a powerful, unstable explosive during processing. As a result, a modified air bag inflator is becoming more 
common. In the modified system, known as a hybrid inflator, a 
pressurized gas, typically argon, an inert gas, is used in 
combination with a smaller amount of less hazardous solid 
propellant to inflate the air bag. Although hybrid systems take 
slightly longer to inflate a bag, e.g., 50 to 55 milliseconds, 
and require a heavier steel housing rather than aluminum used for 
the pyrotechnic versions, substituting argon gas for a solid 
propellant substantially lowers the cost of the inflator system  
 
and is less hazardous to process. In addition, the cost is 
reduced because the hybrid inflator does not require a 
sophisticated filtering system which is required in the 
pyrotechnic version. An air bag module comprises an inflator, a metal housing and 
an inflatable bag. The hybrid version also requires a separate 
electronic circuit including a sensor to monitor the bottle 
pressure for the stored gas. That is, it is necessary to be able 
to determine that the pressure of the stored gas is above a 
selected level to ensure effective deployment of the air bag when 
called for. A pressure switch for use as a sensor in a hybrid air bag 
system is shown and described in U.S. Patent No. 4,049,935. The 
switch is placed within a pressure chamber of an air bag system 
to monitor the pressure level therein and to provide a signal if 
the pressure in the chamber decreases below a certain level. The 
switch employs a diaphragm movable between opposite reinforcement 
sections. Movement of the diaphragm caused by a pressure change 
pushes a contact arm against the bias of a spring, through a pin, 
to engage a stationary contact and complete an electric circuit. 
As noted in the patent the reinforcement sections are spaced 
apart on the central axis about 0.035
