<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method of compressing data obtained from ultrasonic propagation-time measurements made at a given pulse-repetition rate over a broad surface by an inspection probe which slides through the pipe in order to detect corrosion and other abnormalities in the pipe. The method proposed enables the data-compression factor to considerably increased compared with prior art methods. By taking into careful consideration the particular physical characteristics of the pipe, a high data-compression factor can be achieved during a run and, for the subsequent analysis, reliable reproduction ensured of the actual conditions in the pipe.

Method of compressing data obtained from ultrasonic 
transit time measurements over a broad surface, which 

measurements are effected at a prescribed repeat frequency, 
via a measuring probe, which slides through a pipe, to 

measure corrosion and other pipe abnormalities, the transit 
time between a sending pulse and a first sound pulse 

arising therefrom, the front wall echo, and the transit 
time between the sound pulse and a first rear wall echo 

being detected by one ultrasonic sensor module per 
ultrasonic sensor, the prerun being detected from the 

difference in transit time between the sending pulse and 
the front wall echo, and the remaining wall thickness being 

determined from the difference in transit time between the 
front wall echo and the rear wall echo, and data values of 

identical format being formed from the measurement values 
occurring inside and outside a prescribed tolerance band, 

which is described by a reference value and a window, which 
lies in predefined units symmetrically around the reference 

value, associated with the particular sensor, after an 
analog-digital conversion, and such data undergoes a 

decompressible compression, the data from the ultrasonic 
transit time measurement for the prerun and the wall 

thickness being recorded with two different resolution 
ranges, into a rough resolution range for measurement 

values inside the tolerance band, a high resolution range 
for measurement values outside the tolerance band, the data 

format containing a bit, the prefix bit, which is not set 
in the case of a measurement value lying outside the 

tolerance band, and the data word, the value, belonging to 
the measurement value being completely stored, and which 

prefix bit is set in the case of at least two successive 
measurement values lying inside the tolerance band, and 

hence a multiplier counting process is interpreted for this 
value instead of the successive ones, characterised in that  

 

the tolerance band is temporarily narrowed when a change 
in wall thickness is detected, so that the resolution of 

the measurement of the corrosion possibly existing in this 
region is not reduced; 
a relatively long sequence from a failure of a sensor or 
from failures of sensors is shown by a multiplier, and the 

prefix bit prefixes a value associated with a measurement 
value, which is not physically significant in connection 

with the ultrasonic measurement using the measuring probe; 
in a second stage of the compression, two or more 
successive compressed identical sets of data are compressed 

again by an identification value and a multiplication 
value; 
a failure of a sensor in the prerun in connection with 
the measurement signifies a failure of a measurement value 

in respect of the wall thickness and, in consequence, the 
wall thickness value is considered to be a value inside the 

tolerance band, whereby a higher degree of compression 
results; 
a particular prerun reference value is supplied for each 
individual sensor, and such value is constantly updated 

during a measuring operation by a continuous averaging of a 
specific number of prerun values and stored in a multiply 

redundant manner; 
for the wall thickness measurement for all of the sensors 
of a probe, only one reference value, the wall thickness 

reference value, is maintained, which is constantly updated 
by a continuous arithmetic averaging of a specific number 

of successive sets of data during the probe operation, is 
thus continuously adapted to varying wall thicknesses and 

is stored in a multiply redundant manner, and all of the 
values of a set of data lying outside the tolerance band  

 
are used for the averaging process if there are more values 

than lie inside said band; 
echo failures, i.e. measurement value 0, are not used for 
reference values when taking the average value; and 
range excesses (measurement value 127) are not used when 
takin
g the average value. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the tolerance band is described by the prerun reference 

value and a window of a prescribed width, which window is 
placed symmetrically around said reference value. 
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the width of the tolerance band is so selected that it does 

not fall within the range of measurement values of 
corrosion locations which have to be detected on the basis 

of their advanced degree of corrosion. 
Method according to claim 3, characterised in that, 
at the beginning of a test run, the reference values are 

produced by averaging over a predetermined number of sets 
of data, and the reference value calculation is effected 

parallel to the data detection and data compression. 
Method according to claim 4, characterised in that, 
before the start of a data block which is to be stored, the 

reference values of the prerun are stored in two separate 
sets of data and, in consequence, become valid for the 

entire data block. 
Method according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the actual wall reference value at any given time is added 

to every 10th set of data or to an appropriate number.  
 
Method according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the compression of the data is effected in real time. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that, 
in an alternatively additional compression stage, the 

reference values for the compression are formed from the 
chronologically preceding set of data and, depending on the 

degree of compression, a decision is made about the 
compression processes by which the compressed data is 

stored.
