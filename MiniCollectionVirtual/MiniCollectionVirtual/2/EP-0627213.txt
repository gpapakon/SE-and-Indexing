<ABSTRACT>
A hair growth and restoration promoter containing as the active ingredient a plant 
extract prepared from an orchidacean such as calanthe, phaius or other orchid having 

false corms. The promoter is prepared from the subterranean stems of 
Calanthe discolor
 
Lindl., 
Phaius flavus Blume
 Lindl., or 
Oreorchis pateus
 Lindl. through the steps of 
water washing, slicing, immersion in an aqueous alcohol solution to effect extraction, 

purification by filtration, addition of vitamins, amino acids, animal and vegetable 
oils, sodium chloride and so forth, and appropriate dilution with an aqueou
s alcohol 
solution. When applied to a person who suffers from serious falling or thinning of 

hair or has lost hair, the promoter promotes hair growth and restoration.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hair growth and restoration
promoter having as an active ingredient, an extract drawn from at
least one kind of orchidaceae plant selected from a group of
Calanthe R. Br., Phaius Lour., and other genera having a pseudo bulb.
More specifically, this invention relates to a hair growth and
restoration promoter which is used for promotion of hair growth and
restoration especially in a patient whose hair has fallen out,
thinned out or been lost completely.Conventionally, a variety of hair growth and restoration
promoter have been used to cope with physiological symptoms such as
balding and thinning of the hair, scalp disorders such as dandruff
and seborrhea, and to prevent and treat these symptoms.Generally, a preparation used for hair growth and restoration
aims facilitating the circulation of the blood, activating the hair
matrix cell, inhibiting the secretion of lipids from the scalp skin,
and supplementing nutrition to the hair.Prior art compositions which have attempted to achieve promotion
of hair growth and restoration, have prepared compositions by
combining glyceride pentadecanate, cepharanthin, Swertia extract
liquid, soluble sustain, ginseng extract liquid, â„“ -menthol,
isopropylmethylphenol, glycyrrhetinic acid, tocopherol acetate,
hinokitiol, capsicum tincture, sweet grass extract, nictoinamide,
salicylic acid, Takanaru, or etc.The above-mentioned preparation are known for promoting hair
growth and restoration. However, it is generally desired that a hair
growth and restoration promoter not only promote hair growth, hair
restoration, and prevent its falling out, but also be effective 
against the occurrence of dandruff or itch. It is also preferable
that a hair growth and restoration promoter be safe without inflicting
adverse reaction onto the scalp over a long period of time. A need
for a safety and effective hair growth and restoration promoter has
thus evolved.By using conventional medications containing the aforementioned
ingredients, severe loss of the hair is temporarily controlled, but
thinning hair of hair is not, and the loss of hair recurs over time.Therefore, conventional medications do not produce satisfactory
results. Use of conventional medications and remedies in a patient
whose hair had been lost entirely only produce downy hair about a
half year after application, and no further hair growth can be
expected.Document Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol.23, no.227(C-600)
discloses a promoter for hair restoration and hair growth.In light of the foregoing, this
