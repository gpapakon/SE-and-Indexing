<ABSTRACT>
An exercise apparatus (10) having a vertically movable 
weight (52), and an input pedal mechanism (18,20) engaged by the user 

(12) to 
input an input power with a unidirectional exercise force at a 

user-selected velocity for moving the weight (52) upward. Also 
included is a brake applying a negative braking power with a 

unidirectional braking force opposing the exercise force. The 
braking power has a braking velocity for permitting downward 

movement of the weight. A brake controller controls the 
application of the brake to maintain the braking velocity at a 

selected constant velocity for at least a selected portion of 
the user's exercise time. A differential member (44) is coupled to 

the weight (52) and receives the input power and the braking power. 
The differential member (44) determines a differential between the 

user-selected velocity and the selected constant braking 
velocity, and applies the resultant to movement of the weight (52). 

If the user-selected velocity is greater than the braking 
velocity, the weight is lifted, and if the user-selected 

velocity is less than the selected constant braking velocity, 
the weight is lowered. If they match, the weight is 

maintained in a stationary elevated position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an exercise apparatus with the features
cited in the preamble of claim 1 and a method for exercising
with the features cited in the preamble of claim 20.With an exercise apparatus and a method of exercising of this
type known from US-A-3 848 467, an exercise bar is raised by a
user and a dynamic braking force is applied in opposition and in
proportion to the force applied by the user, such that a
preselected speed is not exceeded. The braking force is
dependent on the user input speed (the raising velocity) and,
therefore, neither one is controlled until a selected maximum
speed is obtained, and thereafter only speed is controlled.US-A-5 013 031 proposes a mechanism for an exercise apparatus
having a flywheel against which a band is tightened. The band
may be manually tightened by turning a knob for each selected
user time. The resistance between the tightened band and the
flywheel provides a contstant resistance force of the apparatus.
Thus, this apparatus is capable of producing controlled load
exercise and provides a selectable constant resistance force
against which the user exercises through a desired range of
motion, independent of the velocity of the movement. The
apparatus provides no means for control of the user input speed.Further prior art are US-A-4 253 662, providing a power driven
mechanism for lifting a weight if the user is exhausted and
DE-34 20 842 A1, proposing a conventional electrical braking
mechanism for a home trainer. It is the object of the present invention to improve an
apparatus and a method of the type mentioned above so that it
allows both controlled load and controlled velocity exercise.This object is attained by an exercise apparatus with the
features cited in claim 1 and a method of exercising with the
features of claim 20, respectively.According to the present invention, it is possible to select a
braking velocity. The differential member determines the
differential between the user-selected velocity and the
selected braking velocity and the result thereof determines the
movement of the connector member. Thus, the user, during at
least a selected portion of the user's exercise time, can apply
an input speed to maintain it at a position by applying input
speed with the user-selected velocity substantially matching
the selected braking velocity.The exercise is achieved with a controlled, constant load which
does not vary during the exercise unless the weight on the
connector member is changed by the user. The exercise is
achieved with a
