<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
Escherichia coli peptidyl prolyl-cis.trans isomerase-α, 
a method of producing the same, and genes coding 
for the same. Peptidyl prolyl-cis.trans isomerase 
accelerates protein folding 
reaction by catalyzing the isomerization of prolyl 
peptide bonds in the protein. It is useful as means for 
activating an inactive protein produced by genetic 
engineering and as a reagent for enzymological analysis. 
Its corresponding gene coding is useful for the 
production of the enzyme by genetic engineering, and is 
also expected to be used as starting material for the 
gene which allows for the production by genetic 
engineering of the enzyme derivatives in which the 
enzymatic activity, intracellular localizability, 
substrate specificity and stability thereof have been 
altered. The present invention further provides means 
for efficient production of a useful protein with a 
correct conformation by expressing the above-mentioned 
gene in the same cells as that in which other gene 
coding for the useful protein is expressed. PPIase was found in the porcine kidneys 
[Fisher, G., Bang, H. & Mech, C. Biomed. Biochim. Acta,43, 1101-1111 (1984)], is known to have the enzymatic 
activity of isomerizing Xaa-Pro bond (wherein Xaa stands 
for any amino acid and Pro for L-proline) [Fisher, G., 
Bang, H. & Mech, C. Biomed.Biochim. Acta, 43, 1101-1111 
(1984)] and accelerate protein folding reaction of some 
denaturated proteins such as immunoglobulin L chain and 
ribonuclease T1 [Lang, K., Schmid, F. & Fisher, G, 
Nature, 329, 268-270 (1987)]. The amino acid sequence 
of the enzyme purified from porcine kidneys was shown to  
 
be identical with that of Cyclophilin, a protein known 
to bind to an immunosuppressive agent, cyclosporine A 
(CsA) which has found to inhibit the PPIase activity. 
Since the immunosuppressive activity is directly 
proportional to the binding ability of CsA derivatives 
to cyclophilin, which represents the most of the 
CsA-binding activity in lymphoid cells, it is inferred 
that the action of CsA, for example, immunosuppressing 
action in T-cells, is mediated through the inhibition of 
the PPIase activity [Takahashi, N., Hayano, E. & Suzuki, 
M. Nature337, 473-475 (1989)]. The CsA binding and the 
PPIase activities were found in almost all organs and in 
nearly all species. However it is not known how CsA 
acts specifically on immune system, particularly on T 
cells, during an organ transplantation, has not been 
explained. Rhodopsin, a visual pigment
