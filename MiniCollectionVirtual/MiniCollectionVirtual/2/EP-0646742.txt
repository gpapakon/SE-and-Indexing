<ABSTRACT>
A gate valve for pipes carrying gaseous or liquid media laden with solids comprises a gate-valve housing in which a displaceable closing element rests with its closing face against an inflated ring seal (66) in the closed position. The ring seal (66) is designed with an all-round cavity (82) which is connected to a connection (78) for a source of pressure. An annular supporting spring (84) is arranged in the cavity (82) and supports the ring seal (76) in its uninflated starting position, for this purpose resting in a supporting manner by its apex region, which points towards the closing face of the closing body, against the inner circumference of the cavity (82) of the unpressurised, undeformed ring seal (66) inserted into the gate-valve housing and resting against the supporting walls of said spring all the way round.

Gate valve for pipelines for transporting solids-containing, gaseous or 
liquid media with a gate valve body (12), in which a displaceable closing body 

(14) in the closed position engages with its closing surface (53) on an 
expanded ring seal (66), which is firmly positioned in the gate valve body (12) 

and is constructed with a circumferential cavity (82), which is connected to 
a pressure source connection (78) and which prior to the start of the opening 

movement of the closing body (14) is pressure-relieved by means of a relief 
valve (106), characterised in that an annular bearing spring (84) is located in 

the cavity (82) and supports the ring seal (66) in its expansion-free starting 
position. 
Gate valve according to claim 1, characterised in that the top region of 
the bearing spring (84), which is directed towards the closing surface (53) of 

the closing body (14), bears on the inner circumference of the cavity (82) of 
the pressure-relieved, undeformed ring seal (66) engaging all round on its 

support walls and inserted in the gate valve body (12). 
Gate valve according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the bearing 
spring is a wound helical spring (84) permeable for the expanding medium 

between its turns. 
Gate valve according to claim 3, characterised in that the helical spring 
is designed for absorbing a pressure up to approximately 5 x 10
5
 Pa to 10
6
 
Pa acting on its circumference at right angles to its longitudinal axis. 
Gate valve according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in that the helical 
spring (84) has a wire thickness between approximately 0.5 to 1.5 mm, a 

pitch between approximately 0.8 and 2.5 mm and a gap between adjacent  
 

wires of approximately 0.3 to 1 mm. 
Gate valve according to claim 5, characterised in that the wire 
thickness is approximately 1 mm, the pitch approximately 1.5 mm and the 

gap approximately 0.5 mm. 
Gate valve according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that the ring seal (66) is placed in the gate valve body (2) upstream of the 

closing body (14) in the flow direction. 
Gate valve according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that the ring seal (66) is constructed as a cross-sectionally open, 

circumferential channel and is inserted in an annular groove (76) of the gate 
valve body (12). 
Gate valve according to claim 8, characterised in that the ring seal (66) 
is placed in adhesion-free manner in the annular groove (76). 
Gate valve according to claim 8 or 9, characterised in that the annular 
groove (76) is undercut and the outer contour of the ring seal (66) is 

correspondingly dovetail-shaped. 
Gate valve according to one of the claims 8 to 10, characterised in that 
the annular groove (76) has a through hole (78) as a connection for a 

pressure source (90).
