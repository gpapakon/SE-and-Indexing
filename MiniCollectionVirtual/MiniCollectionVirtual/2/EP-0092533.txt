<ABSTRACT>
A welding bench intended especially for carrying work­
pieces to be welded by a welding robot. 
The welding bench according to the invention permits the 
setting of workpieces in different positions relative to a 

welding robot while the workpiece is supported on an inner 
frame (2). 
According to the invention, the welding bench (1) com­
prises an inner frame (2), on which workpieces are to be at­

tached, and which inner frame (2) is tiltable about a hinge axle 
(3, 4) in an outer frame (5). The outer frame (5) is supported on 

a stand (6) and rotatable relative to the stand (6) about a 
rotation axle (12). The rotation axle (12) extends substantially 

perpendicularly to said hinge axle (3, 4). The inner frame (2) 
and, respectively, the outer frame (5) are driven each by a 

motor (22 and, respectively, 15). 
The inner frame (2) is lockable relative to the outer frame 
(5), and the outer frame (5) is lockable relative to the stand (6).

<DESCRIPTION>

Welding bench
This invention relates to a welding bench intended primarily to be used in connection with robot welding of workpieces.


At the robot welding of different workpieces, a robot carrying a welding head is programmed to carry out certain definite movements and thereby to weld. The workpieces to be welded are positioned accurately in relation to the robot and generally fixed in their position in so-called welding fixtures.


In many cases such a workpiece is to be provided with several welds, which may be located both on the upper and lower surface of the workpiece.


At such welding it is necessary, at the present state of art, to place the same workpiece in different fixtures for rendering possible the welding of all welds.


The reason of this is that the robot is not capable to approach all welding points when the workpiece is clamped in a fixture, and another reason is, from a purely welding technical point of view, that the workpiece shall be inclined slightly so that the welding line on the workpiece forms a certain angle with the horizontal plane.


When workpieces are to be welded together by a plurality of welds in different places, the workpiece often must be clamped in more than two fixtures so that the robot can approach the zone in question, and also a suitable inclination of the welding line is obtained.


At present fixtures are available, which can be rotated between two end positions about an axle. These fixtures imply for certain workpieces that at least two welds can be laid while the workpiece is fixed, by rotating the fixture between said two end positions.  


In most cases, however, an optimum welding operation requires the workpiece to be capable of being rotated in all directions. This, however, is not possible with known art in the technological field concerned.


To fix workpieces in fixtures is a manual work, which requires much time, and it therefore constitutes a substantial part of the costs of robot welding.


The present invention eliminates the aforesaid shortcomings and permits in most cases that the workpiece is to be fixed only once in a fixture.


The present invention, thus, relates to a welding bench intended especially for carrying workpieces to be welded by   a;twelding      robqt,and    is characterized in that the welding bench comprises an inner frame, on which the workpieces are intended to be attached, which inner frame is tiltable about a hinge axle in an outer frame, that the outer frame is supported on a stand and rotatable relative to the
