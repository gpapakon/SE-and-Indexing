<ABSTRACT>
In the area of active noise cancelation headsets, the noisy environment often encountered in the link with communication systems causes lack of intelligibility on the outward communications path. Consequently another in-wire cancellation channel to enhance the intelligibility is required. This additional processing channel adds to the cost of the headset. The invention uses residual microphones (12) to reproduce the sound that remains in the ear after cancelation so that the controller (13) can make further adjustments through filter (15) and LMS adapter (14) to the anti-noise signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hands-free active noise canceling
headset comprising clamping means adapted to secure the headset
to the user's head, said headset including a speaker
means and a microphone means operatively connected to a controller
means adapted to produce an anti-noise signal to said
speaker means.US-A-5,001,763 discloses an active noise cancellation headset
provided with a boom microphone, two input transducers and
two speakers asigned to the headsets. The boom microphone is
to pick up the user's speech for communication producing a
signal which represents the user's speech and the surrounding
noise from the environment superimposed. The input transducers
are part of an active noise cancellation mechanism in the
headset. They are positioned opposite to the outlet of the
speaker mechanism in the headset so that they are subjected
only to sound originating from the environment, but not exposed
to sound originating from the speakers. A control unit
is provided for amplifying and, if desired, for inverting the
signals of the input transducers so that the speakers in the
headset can be provided with a signal which is either amplifying
sound picked up by the input transducers at a gain beyond 
the minimum level heard by the ear or which is canceling
noise of the surrounding environment.From US-A-4,667,667 an active acoustic attenuation system
provided for attenuating an undesirable output acoustic wave
in a duct or plant is known. This is achieved by introducing
a canceling acoustic wave from an omni-directional speaker at
the output of the duct or plant. By an adapted filter means
connected to an input microphone at the input of the duct or
plant and to an error microphone at the output of the duct or
plant, which may comprise one or several LMS (Least Mean
Square) filters, the duct or plant is modelled with an
adapted filter model. This adapted filter means produces a
correction signal based on the input microphone signal and
the error microphone signal and feeds it to the speaker to
introduce canceling sound or acoustic waves such that the error
signal of the error microphone approaches a given value
such as zero.In the area of active noise cancellation headsets, the noisy
environment often encountered in the link with communication
systems causes lack of intelligibility on the outward communications
path. Consequently another in-wire cancellation
channel to enhance the intelligibility is required. This additional
processing channel adds to the cost of the headset.

<CLAIMS>
A hands-free active noise canceling headset (10) comprising
clamping means (17) adapted to secure the headset to

the users head, said headset including a speaker means (18)
and a microphone means (12) operatively connected to a controller

means (13) adpated to produce an anti-noise signal to
said speaker means,

characterized in that

the headsets (19) are open backed, the microphone means (12)
are residual microphone means directly exposed to the sound

originating from the speaker means (18), and in that the signals
from said residual microphone means (12) are used for

outward bound communications.
A headset (10) as in claim 1, characterized in that
there are two open backed headsets (19) on that clamping

means (17) positioned opposite one another so as to be on opposite
sides of a users head over the ears.
A headset (10) as in claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that said controller means (13) includes an LMS adapter (14)

having inherent compensation for any effects or feedback delays
around the control circuit, an adaptive filter means

(15) and an equalizer means (16) to handle the anti-noise
signals and communication signals from said residual microphone

means.
A headset (10) as in claim 3, characterized in that
said controller means (13) is adapted to develop a reference 

signal by subtracting an equalized anti-noise signal of its
own from the residual microphone signal.
A headset (10) as in any of the foregoing claims, characterized
in that said residual microphone means (12) is a

small electret microphone.
A headset (10) as in any of the foregoing claims, characterized
in that said open backed headset means includes two

residual microphones (12) adapted to produce in phase signals
and in that the control means adds the signals generated by

said two microphones (12) which improves the signal to noise
ratio as the signals are in place.
A headset (10) as in claim 1, characterized in that the
headset means (10) and the control means (13) are connected

by wire means.
