<ABSTRACT>
A porous solid material for plant propagation comprises granules af a porous expanded mineral, such as perlite or vermiculite, distributed within a porous open-cell foamed hydrophilic water-retentive polyurethane matrix. The material may be moulded into sheets of break-off units for seed germination and propagation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a porous solid 
material for the propagation and growth of plants. Intensive horticulture uses a wide range of materials 
for propagation (i.e. early growth) and production of crop 
plants. All suitable materials must provide appropriate 
physical conditions for plant growth. Some materials 
provide some or all of the nutrients required by growing 
plants, e.g. soil. However, others do not, and where no 
nutrients are available these have to be independently 
supplied. The use of an inert substrate with provision of 
externally supplied nutrients is the basis of hydroponic 
plant growth techniques. A number of hydroponic substrates are available. The 
most widely used material is generically known as Rockwool 
which is in the form of a mineral fibre batt or slab. The 
material is water-absorbing. However, being fibrous in 
nature and due to the manufacturing methods used, it 
typically has a specific grain along the length of the 
fibres; unless used as loose fibres. Other materials are available and these include 
organic materials, such as wood fibre, as well as 
inorganic materials, such as perlite. Perlite is a porous  
 
expanded mineral material made by crushing silicaceous 
rock and subjecting it to high temperatures to produce a 
mineral foam. Whilst Perlite is in many ways a suitable material 
for hydroponic culture, its commercial use is restricted 
because of the unavailability of compact integral forms of 
the granular material, in which young plants can be 
readily propagated, until they reach a stage in which they 
can be successfully transplanted into the loose granular 
Perlite material. Such compact propagating materials 
also require to be physically and chemically compatible 
with the Perlite granules. Such compact materials should ideally be available in 
the form of blocks or moulded units. In order to be 
suitable plant propagation materials, the material should 
be porous to air and water, so as to allow the root 
structure to develop. The material should also be 
water-retentive so that the young plants do not dry out 
and can be readily provided with a source of nutrient 
solution. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
material which seeks to achieve these objects, at least in 
part.  
 Published Japanese patent specification JP1320937 
(880154653) discloses the production of a material for a 
bed for raising seedlings which has water absorbing 
properties yet does not float in water. This is achieved 
by combining an open-cell
