<ABSTRACT>
High purity argon is produced by subjecting a two-phase liquid-vapour mixture 
containing up to 3 volume % of nitrogen and/or up to 5 volume % oxygen to 

cryogenic temperature swing adsorption in an adsorption bed containing one or 
more adsorbents selective for nitrogen and/or oxygen at a temperature between 

the bubble point and the dew point of the two-phase mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the purification of fluids, and more particularly to the 
purification of a fluid by the removal of small of amounts of fluid impurities from 
the fluid by adsorption. The purification of fluids by the removal of small concentrations of fluid 
impurities can be accomplished by several physical and chemical techniques, 
including distillation, chemical reaction and adsorption. In some cases it is 
desirable to use one of these procedures while in other cases it is preferable to 
use another. The separation of argon from air and subsequent purification of 
the separated argon illustrates a case in point. Crude argon produced by the cryogenic distillation of air by conventional 
techniques generally contains 1-5% by volume oxygen and up to about 1% by 
volume nitrogen. If it is desired to produce higher purity argon, for example 
argon containing less than about 10 parts per million (ppm) each of oxygen and 
nitrogen, the oxygen and nitrogen are removed from the argon stream by one or 
more of the available physical or chemical techniques. According to one 
technique oxygen and nitrogen are removed from the crude argon stream by 
further distilling the crude argon stream. This method of purification is capital 
intensive because the boiling points of oxygen and argon are only a few degrees 
apart; consequently a very high column with a large number of trays is required 
to reduce the oxygen content to the parts per million (ppm) range. Another technique that has been employed is reacting the oxygen in the argon 
stream with excess hydrogen over a suitable catalyst at relatively high 
temperatures, and subsequently removing the excess hydrogen and nitrogen by 
cryogenic distillation. Removing oxygen by this technique requires a significant 
quantity of energy, however, since the gas stream must be heated to a relatively 
high reaction temperature and later cooled to cryogenic temperatures to distil off  
 
the excess hydrogen and the nitrogen present in the gas stream. Furthermore, 
the high purity hydrogen required for the oxidation is not always available at 
locations where it is desired to operate such argon purification plants. Argon has been separated from nitrogen and oxygen by pressure swing 
adsorption (PSA) at ambient temperatures. U. S. Patent Nos. 4,144,038 and 
4,477,265 disclose adsorption of oxygen and nitrogen from an argon-rich 
feedstock withdrawn from the rectification column of a cryogenic air separation 
plant. These processes suffer from low yield and low
