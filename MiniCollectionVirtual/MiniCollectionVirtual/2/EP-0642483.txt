<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to chlorination and elimination, particularly to chlorination 
and elimination of chlorine from an organic compound having an active methine group. In the Journal of Organic Chemistry, Vol. 44, No. 7 (1979), p. 1192-1194 a phase-transfer-catalyzed 
chlorination is disclosed. Phenylacetonitrile, its α-substituted derivatives, 
fluorene, and trichloroethylene react with carbon tetrachloride in the presence of 50% aqueous 
sodium hydroxide and triethylbenzylammonium chloride as catalyst to form chloro derivatives. 
The fate of these derivatives depends on the structure of the carbon acid. Carbanions of some 
of the chloro compounds formed in situ can be trapped by suitable electrophiles to give 
derivatives of glycidic nitrile or dicyanocyclopropane, for example. U.S. Patent No. 3,830,862 
discloses the formation of unsaturated compounds. Alkenes are prepared by base-catalyzed 
chlorination of sulfones with tetrahalides followed by base-catalyzed elimination. The reactions 
are accelerated by the presence of a polar compound. It is often difficult to form compounds having unsaturation in a position desired 
for further reaction. For instance, chlorination processes often result in chlorine on ring atoms 
isolated from other ring substituents such that subsequent elimination is impossible (for 
example aromatic chlorines) or leads to endocyclic unsaturation rather than exocyclic 
unsaturation. Compounds having exocyclic substitution, however, are generally more useful, 
for instance, in preparing addition polymers and in alkylation reactions. Chlorinations of compounds having an active methine structure such as 9-methylfluorene 
using common chlorination agents such as chlorine, sulfuryl chloride, N-chlorosuccinimide 
and phosphorus pentachloride are generally disadvantageous because the 
products of such reactions exhibit substitution on the aromatic rings, instead of substitution of 
the acidic proton. Therefore, it is not feasible to prepare 9-chloro-9-methylfluorene and 
analogous compounds such as 1-chloro-1-ethylindene using conventional chlorination 
technology. The compound 9-methylenefluorene was reported by Ferrer (Anales Soc. Espan. 
Fis. Quim. 1922, 20, 459, Chem Abstr. 17, 3177 (1922) and Ber. 55, 3317 (1922)) as arising from 
distillation of 9-methyl-9-hydroxyfluorene in vacuo in the presence of aluminum phosphate. 
The compound was not isolated at that point, but was brominated to alpha,9-dibromomethylfluorene. 
The author states that the compound was debrominated by
