<ABSTRACT>
A ballast circuit for a gas discharge lamp, of the type having a pair of 
resistively heated cathodes that are resistively heated both during a cathode 

pre-heat period prior to lamp turn-on, and during steady state lamp operation, 
is disclosed. The ballast circuit includes circuitry for providing, on a bus 

conductor, a d. c. bus voltage with respect to a ground, and a converter, 
responsive to the d.c. bus voltage, for supplying bidirectional current to a 

resonant load circuit. The resonant load circuit includes the gas discharge 
lamp, a resonant capacitor coupled between the lamp cathodes such that its 

voltage varies with lamp voltage, and a resonant inductor serially coupled to 
the resonant capacitor and cooperating therewith to set a magnitude, and 

resonant frequency, of the bidirectional lamp current. Circuitry is provided for 
powering the resistively heated lamp cathodes, to thereby heat the cathodes. 
Further included is a circuit for maintaining the lamp voltage during a 
cathode pre-heat period below a predetermined level so as to prevent lamp 

turn-on during such period; such circuit includes circuitry for holding a first 
cathode of the lamp at a substantially constant voltage, and circuitry for 

clamping a second cathode of the lamp below the predetermined level. such 
clamping circuitry includes a positive temperature coefficient (PTC) 

impedance device coupled to a second cathode of the lamp, and serially 
connected by a positively poled clamping diode to the bus conductor, and 

serially connected by a negatively poled clamping diode to the ground.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ballast circuit 
for a cathode-heated type of gas discharge lamp, such 
as a fluorescent lamp, and, more particularly, to 
improved performance of cathode-heating circuitry of 
such ballast circuit. Certain types of gas discharge lamps, such as one 
class of fluorescent lamps, include a pair of cathodes 
each of which incorporates an internal resistance that 
becomes heated when a respective current passes 
therethrough; such cathodes are referred to hereinafter 
as resistively heated cathodes. The "resistive" 
heating occurs both during steady state lamp operation, 
when the cathodes are also heated from an arc discharge 
in the lamp, and during a so-called cathode pre-heat 
period, prior to lamp turn-on. The cathodes of such 
lamps are designed to emit electrons during normal lamp 
operation. Such cathodes typically comprise tungsten 
or similar metal, which, when uncoated, is susceptible 
to fracturing when heated to emit electrons. The 
cathodes, therefore, are typically coated with an 
electron-emissive material, to facilitate electron 
emission, while protecting the cathode metal from 
fracturing. It is desirable, in a fluorescent lamp of the 
mentioned type, for the cathodes to be heated to at 
least about 700° Centigrade (C) during the cathode preheat 
period, prior to lamp turn-on, to achieve a 
desired thermionic emission of electrons from the 
cathodes. During steady state lamp operation, a 
continued heating of the cathodes, to about 500° C is  
 
desirable to maintain a preferably, thermionic emission 
of electrons from the cathodes and long cathode life. A typical power supply, or (as typically 
described) "ballast," circuit for a cathode-heated type 
of fluorescent gas discharge lamp utilizes a positive 
temperature coefficient (PTC) resistor in a circuit for 
heating the lamp cathodes, both during the cathode preheat 
period, and during steady state lamp operation. 
The gas discharge lamp has a pair of resistively heated 
cathodes, each of which has a respective terminal 
coupled to a resonant power supply circuit for 
supplying bidirectional current to the lamp. Across 
the other pair of cathode terminals, a positive 
temperature coefficient (PTC) resistor is respectively 
coupled, via a serially connected capacitor, to 
complete a circuit for supplying current to, and hence 
heating, the resistively heated cathodes. Examples of 
ballast circuits utilizing PTC resistors can be found 
in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,647,817; 4,782,268 and 5,122,712. The PTC
