<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tub support (1) made of rigid foam plastic, in particular of a particle foam plastic, having a bottom (2), a substantially plane bottom inner face (25) and side and end walls (4, 5, 6, 7), the bottom (2) and the side and end walls (4, 5, 6, 7) being integrally constructed, opening parts (10, 11, 26, 27, 28) being removably constructed in the bottom (2), for example by means of predetermined separating regions provided during manufacture, and furthermore insertion parts (18, 20 to 23) being receivable on the bottom inner face for the purpose of height compensation. To achieve as good a supportability of a tub shape as possible and at the same time maximum versatility, the invention proposes that the opening parts (10, 11, 26, 27, 28) are assigned, with respect to a longitudinal extent of the tub support, to a central region and one end region, with a bottom cross-bracing (12) remaining between at least two opening parts (10, 11, 26, 27, 28), and that substantially the entire bottom inner face (25) is constructed to receive the insertion parts (18, 20, 21, 22, 23).
