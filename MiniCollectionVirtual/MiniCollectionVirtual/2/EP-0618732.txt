<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image and
code data compression apparatus formed of an image data
compression apparatus and a code data compression
apparatus. More particularly, the image data compression
apparatus is provided for compressing the image data in
accordance with an orthogonal transformation and
obtaining code data after compression of the image data,
and the code data compression apparatus is provided for
further compressing the code data in accordance with the
orthogonal transformation and obtaining re-compressed
code data after compression of the code data.The image and code data compression apparatus
according to the present invention can realize a high
data compression rate in accordance with an algorithm for
a compression method which is defined by JPEG (Joint
Photographic Experts Group).As a method for compressing image and code data
using an orthogonal transformation, an algorithm for
compression was standardized by JPEG which was jointly
organized by the International Standardization
Organization (i.e., ISO) and the Comite Consultatif
International Telegraphique et Telephonique (i.e.,
CCITT).Such an algorithm is described, for example, in
"JPEG, DIS 10918 DIGITAL COMPRESSION AND CODING OF
CONTINUOUS-TONE STILL IMAGES, PART I REQUIREMENTS AND
GUIDELINES". According to this document, image data are
divided into a plurality of image data blocks, and each
image data block is processed in accordance with a known
DCT (Discrete Cosine Transformation) to calculate a DCT
coefficient (below, transformation coefficient). 
Further, the calculated transformation coefficients are
quantized to obtain quantized transformation coefficients.
Still further, the quantized transformation coefficients
are processed in order from a low frequency to a high
frequency in accordance with a variable length coding
process to realize compression of the image data.In this case, the variable length coding process is
performed for data which sums up the number of the
quantized transformation coefficients having nonzero value
and the number of the quantized transformation coefficients
continuing just before the nonzero value.When improving the above conventional method of image
data compression which complies with the JPEG standard;
basically, it is necessary to ensure the code data which
can decode the image data by using a standardized decoding
algorithm to realize an improved image data compression
method.The object of the invention is to provide an image and
code data compression apparatus enabling high
