<ABSTRACT>
Performance of a high temperature diffusion furnace (10) is enhanced by an improved multi-furnace module design (11). The furnace (10) is constructed of materials suitable for clean room environments with an adjustable leveling frame assembly (59). A side out assembly (31) and heating element alignment mechanism (85) of individual furnace tube modules (25) with a heating element hoist mechanism (22) allows for enhanced maintainability. Heat treatment performance is improved by a sealed heating element (12) with individual furnace module cooling system (15, 16, 30). Improved thermal couple (107) is positioned to enhance heat treatment process control and heating element maintainability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed toward high
temperature diffusion process furnaces typically used in
the semiconductor industry.High temperature diffusion furnaces are well known to
the semiconductor industry. Heat treatment in high
temperature diffusion furnaces is one of the many steps
in the manufacturing process of silicon wafers.
Typically, process gas is injected into the heat
treatment process in order to alter the composition of
the wafers. For example, heat treatment of wafers with
an appropriate process gas allows doping elements such as
boron to be introduced into the molecular structure of
the semiconductor material.A high temperature diffusion furnace may include
multiple furnace modules capable of heat treating
multiple sets of silicon wafers. The individual
diffusion furnace modules comprise a heating element
which includes a process chamber for a process, tube which
is shielded by a liner. The process chamber has a load 
end where the wafers are inserted and a source end where
process gas is injected. In addition, scavenger boxes
are included to remove excess process gas along with an
energy kit. Typically, the furnace modules are housed in
a stacked orientation.The heating elements are generally cylindrical in
shape and symmetrical. The heating elements have an
outer metallic housing, usually comprised of stainless
steel or aluminum, and inner layers of insulating
materials such as ceramic fiber. A furnace chamber is
created between heating coils and a heating element
liner. Several heating coils are secured together to
form a continuous coil, with the middle heating coil
enabling optimal temperature at the middle of process
tube. The end heating coil is operated to enable a
temperature in the process tube sufficient to overcome
losses out the end of the furnace and to preheat any
gasses being introduced into the furnace. The heating
coil is generally a helical resistance wire made of
chrome-aluminum-iron alloy, the wires generally heavy
gauge (0.73cm to 0.95cm) (.289" to .375") in diameter) for extended heating
coil life at an elevated temperature.The maximum permissible operating temperature for the
heating coil alloy is 1400°C. Since a temperature
differential exists between the heating coil and the
inside of the process tube, diffusion furnaces are
normally operated at a maximum operating process tube
temperature of 1300°C.Silicon wafers are heat treated in the middle section
of the process tube. The process tube is fabricated of
quartz, polysilicon, silicon carbide or ceramic.
