<ABSTRACT>
Novel phosphinic acid-containing peptidyl compounds of formula (I) are found to be useful inhibitors of matrix metallonendoproteinase-mediated diseases including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis, tumor invasion in certain cancers, periodontal disease, corneal ulceration, proteinuria, dystrophobic epidermolysis bullosa, and coronary thrombosis associated with atherosclerotic plaque rupture. These inhibitors may also be useful in preventing the pathological sequelae following a traumatic injury that could lead to permanent disability. These compounds may also have utility as a means for birth control by preventing ovulation or implantation.

<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONSUBSTITUTED PHOSPHINIC ACID-CONTAINING PEPTIDYLDERIVATIVES AS ANTIDEGENERATIVE AGENTSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to substituted phosphinic acid-containing peptidyl derivatives of formula I useful in the treatment of matrix metalloendoproteinase mediated diseases including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis, tumor invasion in certain cancers, periodontal disease, corneal ulceration, proteinuria, dystrophobic epidermolysis bullosa, and coronary thrombosis associated with atherosclerotic plaque rapture.
 These inhibitors may also be useful in preventing the pathological sequelae following a traumatic injury that could lead to permanent disability. These compounds may also have utility as a means for birth control by preventing ovulation or implantation.The disability observed in osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid-arthritis (RA) is largely due to the loss of articular cartilage. No existing therapeutic agent prevents the attrition of articular cartilage in these diseases."Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs" (DMARDs), i.e., agents capable of preventing or slowing the ultimate loss of joint function in OA and RA, are widely sought. Generic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be combined with such agents to provide some relief from pain and swelling.Stromelysin (a a. proteoglycanase, matrix metalloproteinase-3, MMP-3, procollagenase activator, "transin"), collagenase (aka. interstitial collagenase, matrix metalloproteinase-1, MMP-1) and gelatinase (type-IV collagenase, matrix metalloproteinase-2, MMP-2, 72kDa-gelatinase) are metalloendoproteinases secreted by fibroblasts and chondrocytes, and are capable of degrading the major connective tissue components of articular cartilage. Elevated levels of stromelysin and collagenase have been detected in joints of arthritic humans and animals: K.A. Hasty, R.A. Reife, A.H. Kang, J.M. Stuart, "The role of stromelysin in the cartilage destruction that accompanies inflammatory arthritis", Arthr. Rheum., 33, 388-97 (1990); S.M. Krane, E.P. Amento, M.B. Goldring, S.R.
