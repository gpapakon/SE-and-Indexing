<ABSTRACT>
A side suction type plunger pump. A diameter at one 
end of the plunger is set to be larger than a diameter of a 

seal portion near the other end of the plunger. The 
suction port is provided on the large-diameter portion of 

the cylinder whose diameter corresponds to the diameter of 
the one end of the plunger.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a side suction type 
plunger pump used as a fluid pressure source for a fluid 
pressure control unit or the like. Fig. 2 shows one example of a conventional plunger 
pump of this type used in a brake fluid pressure control 
unit for automobile. GB-A-2.253.882 discloses such a plunger/pump. As shown in this figure, it comprises a plunger 1 
inserted in a cylinder 2, a plunger driving member 3 
comprising a driving shaft 3a provided with an eccentric 
cam 3b and a bearing 3c mounted on the cam 3b, a return 
spring 4, a suction valve 5 for opening and closing a 
passage between a pressure chamber 6 and a suction port 7, 
a discharge valve 8 for opening and closing a passage 
between a pressure chamber 6 and a discharge port 9, a seal 
10 for sealing the outer periphery of the plunger 1 at its 
end open to the air, a plunger case 11, an end plug 12 
coupled to the rear end of the plunger case 11 with a seal 
on its outer periphery, and a plug screw 13 for securing 
the plunger case 11 and the end plug 12 to a unit housing 
14. The plunger 1 has one end disposed in the pressure 
chamber 6 and the other end open to the air and protruding 
out of the cylinder 2. It is pushed against the outer  
 
periphery of the bearing 3c by the return spring 4. In the 
plunger pump, the driving shaft 3a is rotated to move the 
plunger 1 up and down, so that a fluid introduced from the 
side of the plunger is compressed in the pressure chamber 6 
and discharged to the discharge port 9. As is apparent from Fig. 2, such a conventional 
plunger pump had the following problems because the 
diameter a of the pressure-applying portion of the plunger 
1 is the same as the diameter b of the sealed portion at 
its open end. Namely, in this side suction type pump, when the seal 
10 passes the lateral hole (suction port 7) in mounting the 
plunger 1, it might get caught between the edge of the hole 
and the edge of the seal groove and thus get damaged. For 
this reason, the plunger case 11 is provided to accommodate 
the plunger 1 from its opening. Then, the plunger case 11 
now accommodating the plunger 1 is mounted in the unit 
housing 14 so that the seal 10 will not come into tight 
contact with the lateral hole. In this arrangement, since 
it was necessary to provide the plunger case 11 and a seal 
15 on its outer periphery, the number of necessary parts 
increased. It was disadvantageous in terms of cost, 
downsizing and the number of assembling steps. Moreover, it was difficult to assemble the plunger so

<CLAIMS>
A plunger pump of a side suction type comprising a 
pump body (14), a plunger (1) having one end thereof disposed in a 

pressure chamber (6) and the other end thereof being open to 
the air, a driving member (3) for driving said plunger, a 

return spring (4) for urging said plunger against said driving 
member, a cylinder (2) accommodating said plunger, said pump 

body being formed with a suction port (7) open in said cylinder 
and with a discharge p
ort (9), and a seal (10) provided on the outer 
periphery of said plunger at a position nearer to said 

other end of said plunger, said plunger being reciprocated 
to suck fluid through said suction port and compress and 

discharge the fluid through said discharge port,
 
characterized in that the diameter (a) at said one end of said 

plunger is larger than the diameter (b) thereof near said other 
end, and said suction port being provided on a large-diameter 

portion of said cylinder whose diameter 
corresponds to the diameter at said one end of said 

plunger.
