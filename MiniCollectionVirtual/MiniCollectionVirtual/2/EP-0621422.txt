<ABSTRACT>
A control circuit for a hydraulically 
operated transmission for a vehicle, the transmission 

including a fluid line containing pressurised 
hydraulic fluid and which is connectable to an exhaust 

port for downshifting from one forward gear ratio to 
another forward gear ratio, the control circuit 

comprising a solenoid operated valve (318) 
positionable in the fluid line, the solenoid operated 

valve being biased to a normally closed position; a 
relay (510) connected to, and controlling the opening 

and closing of, the solenoid operated valve; and speed 
sensor means (508) monitoring the speed of the vehicle 

and providing a signal to the relay to open the 
solenoid operated valve when the speed of the vehicle 

is below a predetermined level. Prevents engagement 
of first gear ratio when vehicle speed is high enough 

to cause damage to the transmission.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control circuit 
for a hydraulically operated transmission of a vehicle 
and, in particular, to a control circuit for 
preventing a transmission downshifting from one gear 
ratio to another gear ratio when the speed of the 
vehicle is above a predetermined level. EP-A-0503691 
discloses a control circuit in accordance with the 
preamble of claim 1. As is well known, a hydraulically operated 
transmission includes a shift lever which is movable 
by a vehicle operator to manually select the required 
drive for a vehicle. The usual selectable drive 
ranges, in order, comprise park (P), reverse drive 
(R), neutral (N), and one or more forward drive (D), 
(1), (2) modes. When in automatic drive mode (D), a 
control module (which may be electronic based or 
computer based) selects the required forward drive 
gear for the transmission based on a number of 
monitored parameters. Selection of first gear ratio, 
either manually by the vehicle operator moving the 
shift lever, or automatically by the control module 
for the transmission, whilst the vehicle is travelling 
in a forward direction above a predetermined speed can 
result in severe damage to the transmission. Similar 
problems also apply to the downshifting to other 
forward gear ratios at speeds above respective 
predetermined levels. It is an object of the present invention to 
overcome this problem. To this end, a control circuit in accordance 
with the present invention is characterised over 
EP-A-0503691 by the features specified in the 
characterising portion of claim 1.  
 The present invention provides a means of 
protecting the transmission from damage by preventing 
operation of the transmission in first gear ratio 
should the vehicle speed be above a predetermined 
level. The present invention can also be modified to 
allow easy cycling between first gear ratio and 
reverse gear ratio should a driven wheel of the 
vehicle become stuck. The present invention will now be described, 
by way of example, with reference to the accompanying 
drawings, in which:- 
Figure 1 is a schematic view of a hydraulic 
control circuit for a hydraulically operated 
transmission, with the hydraulic control circuit set 
for placing the transmission in first gear of Drive 
(D) mode; Figure 2 is a similar view to Figure 1 with 
the hydraulic control circuit set for placing the 
transmission in second gear of Drive (D) mode; Figure 3 is a similar view to Figure 1 with 
the hydraulic control circuit set for placing the 
transmission in

<CLAIMS>
A control circuit for a hydraulically 
operated transmission for a vehicle, the transmission 

including a fluid line (130) containing pressurised 
hydraulic fluid and which is connectable to an exhaust 

port for downshifting from one forward gear ratio to 
another forward gear ratio, the control circuit 

comprising a solenoid operated valve (318) 
positionable in the fluid line; a relay (510) 

connected to, and controlling the opening and closing 
of, the solenoid operated valve; and speed sensor 

means (280, 508) monitoring the speed of the vehicle; 
characterised in that the solenoid operated valve 

(318) is biased to a normally closed position; and in 
that the speed sensor means (280, 508) provides a signal to 

the relay (510) to open the solenoid operated valve 
when the speed of the vehicle is below a predetermined 

level, the arrangement preventing downshifting when 
the speed of the vehicle is above the predetermined 

level.  
 
A control circuit as claimed in Claim 1, 
wherein the speed sensor means is part of a control 

module (500) for the transmission and comprises a 
speed limit relay (508) which is controlled by a speed 

sensor (280). 
A control circuit as claimed in Claim 1 
or Claim 2, in which the transmission includes a shift 

lever (516) manually movable to a position for 
selecting said another forward gear ratio to form an 

electrical circuit, wherein the electrical circuit 
also provides a signal to the relay (510) to open the 

solenoid operated valve (318) when a switch (512) in 
the electrical circuit is manually closed. 
A control circuit as claimed in Claim 3, 
further comprising a mode switch (504) which is 

manually movable between automatic mode for supplying 
electrical power to the speed sensor means and manual  

 
mode for supplying electrical power to the electrical 

circuit. 
A control circuit as claimed in Claim 3 
or Claim 4, in which the shift lever (516) is manually 

movable to a reverse gear ratio position, wherein the 
electrical circuit further includes an electrical 

connection to the reverse gear ratio position such 
that operation of the switch (512) signals the relay 

(510) to open the solenoid operated valve (318) when 
the shift lever is in the reverse gear ratio position, 

and a time dependent relay (518) which closes when the 
switch is operated, but which opens after a 

predetermined time to terminate the signal to the 
relay (510) to close the solenoid operated valve. 
A control circuit as claimed in any one 
of Claims 1 to 5, wherein the said one forward gear 

ratio is second gear ratio, and said another forward 
gear ratio is first gear ratio.
