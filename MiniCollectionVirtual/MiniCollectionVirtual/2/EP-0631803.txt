<ABSTRACT>
A combined full flow and bypass oil filter for internal 
combustion engines includes a generally cylindrical filter 

body and a generally cylindrical filter head which is 
threadedly attached to the filter body. The filter head 

includes an inlet and an outlet and the flow path between the 
inlet and outlet extends through the filter body. Disposed 

within the filter body is a generally cylindrical and hollow 
full flow filtering element and a generally cylindrical and 

hollow bypass filtering element. The incoming flow of 
lubricating oil passes through the outer diameter surfaces of 

the full flow and bypass filtering elements and exits from 
these filtering elements through their hollow interiors. 

Concentrically positioned in the exiting flow path of the 
full flow filter is a Venturi nozzle which creates a low 

pressure zone. An outlet flow conduit is disposed in flow 
cooperation with the exiting oil flow through the bypass 

filtering element and the exit opening of this flow conduit 
extending from the bypass filtering element is positioned 

within the low pressure zone of the Venturi nozzle. The 
pressure differential across the two filtering elements 

creates a forced flow through the bypass filtering element 
and the filtered oil through both elements combines as part 

of a single flow loop.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to fluid treatment devices for
example for internal combustion engines, gasoline and diesel, and related
equipment which require fluid filtration or other fluid treatment. More
particularly the present invention pertains to lubricating oil filtration employing
both full flow filtration and bypass filtration.Internal combustion engines generally employ two types of filtration in
order to clean the lubricating oil. These two types of filtration are commonly
referred to as full flow filtration and bypass filtration. Full flow filtering
elements receive and filter (relatively coarsely) 90-100% of the regulated oil
pump output prior to supplying the oil to the engine components. Bypass
filters typically receive only 5-10% of the pump output and are generally
effective to "superclean" the oil. Most modern engines (gasoline and diesel)
employ full flow filters. Heavy duty engines (particularly diesel) are often
equipped with bypass filters in addition to full flow filters. Historically,
engineers achieve combined full flow and bypass filtration by one of three
methods.One method of creating combined full flow and bypass filtration is to
place the full flow and bypass filtering elements in separate containers and
provide separate, individual flow circuits with a positive means of forcing flow
through the bypass filter. A second method of achieving combined full flow
and bypass filtration is to place the full flow and bypass filtering elements in
the same container with separate, individual flow circuits and with a positive
means of forcing flow through the bypass filter. A third method involved
placing the full flow and bypass filtering elements in the same, single
container with a single flow circuit through both elements. Treatment devices according to the pre-characterising part of claim 1
are known, for example, from EP-A-0287527, US-A-2843268 and US-A-4655914
which shows the use of a coned Venturi or similar nozzle to increase
flow velocity and create a low-pressure zone, outflow from the bypass element
being directed to open into said zone to induce flow through that element. In
these known constructions the bypass element is in immediate proximity to the
nozzle and the full flow element is more remote therefrom so that the part of
the flow circuit through the latter is longer and the flow passing through the
bypass element enters the low-pressure zone through outlets in the wall of the
nozzle so that said flow has to overcome the existing wall forces.The object of
