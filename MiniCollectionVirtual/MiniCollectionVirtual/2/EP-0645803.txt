<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
fabricating a thin film transistor used in a liquid
crystal display or the like.Figure 7 is a plan view of a conventional
thin film transistor (hereinafter referred to as a TFT)
having a staggered structure.In Figure 7, on the surface of an insulating
substrate 51, a semiconductor layer 52 which is described
below is formed. A gate insulating film (not
shown) is formed so as to cover the surface of the
semiconductor layer 52. The gate insulating film
insulates a gate electrode 53 which will be formed in
a later step from the semiconductor layer 52. On the
surface of the gate insulating film, the gate electrode
53 is formed so as to cross the center portion of
the semiconductor layer 52. A portion of the semiconductor
layer 52 directly under the gate electrode 53
serves as a semiconductor-layer channel region 52c.
One of the portions of the semiconductor layer 52
which are separated by the channel region 52c serves
as a semiconductor-layer source 52a and the other
portion serves as a semiconductor-layer drain 52b. At
positions corresponding to the semiconductor-layer
source 52a and the semiconductor-layer drain 52b,
contact holes 56 and 57 for the connection to a source
electrode 54 and a drain electrode 55 are formed in the
gate insulating film, respectively. At a position in 
the gate electrode 53 opposite to the crossing portion
in which the gate electrode 53 and the semiconductor
layer 52 are crossed, a contact hole 59 for connecting
the gate electrode 53 to a gate bus line 58 is formed.
A TFT having the above-described structure is fabricated
by the following method. The fabrication method
will be schematically described with reference to
Figures 8A through 8C.First, as shown in Figure 8A, a semiconductor
layer 52 is formed on a transparent insulating substrate
51. Then, so as to cover the semiconductor
layer 52, a gate insulating film (not shown) is formed.Next, as shown in Figure 8B, a gate electrode
53 is formed by patterning on the surface of the
gate insulating film so as to cross the semiconductor
layer 52.Next, using the gate electrode 53 as a
mask, an impurity element 60 is implanted from
the gate insulating film side into the semiconductor
layer 52 in a self-aligned manner, so as to form
a semiconductor-layer source 52a and a semiconductor-layer
drain 52b.Next, an interlayer insulating film (not
shown) is formed so as to cover the semiconductor
layer 52 and the gate electrode 53.Thereafter, as shown in Figure 8C, a contact
hole 61 for the
