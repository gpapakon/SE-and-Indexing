<ABSTRACT>
A device for forming ice cubes, particularly for household 
use, comprising a tray (1) for preparing the cubes equipped 

with a plurality of cup elements (2) adapted to contain the 
liquid to be transformed into cubes and contained in an ice 

unit (3), said tray being rotatable so as to make the ice 
cubes drop out of the cup elements (2), and a tank (4) 

containing a multiplicity of doses for filling the tray (1), 
wherein the tray (1) is filled with a dose of liquid coming 

from a container (5) with fixed volume supplied by the tank 
(4). The filling of the container (5) and the tray takes 

place by gravity, and the admission of liquid from the tank 
(4) to the container (5) and/or from the tank to the tray 

takes place via corresponding pipes comprising stop valves 
(6, 7). A refrigerator, particularly for household use, 

equipped with the described device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a refrigerator, particularly 
for household use, equipped with an improved device for 
producing ice. The invention relates particularly to a type of refrigerator 
containing at least one tray disposed in a unit with very low 
temperature and intended to be filled and to hold water to be 
transformed into a plurality of cubes or small pieces of ice. For greater simplicity the present description will refer to 
a generic type of refrigerator, but it is understood that the 
invention can also be freely extended to very different types 
of refrigerators or freezers, also for use in canteens, 
equipped with at least one device for preparing ice. Refrigerators are known in which ice is prepared simply by 
filling a suitably shaped tray with water manually and 
inserting it in a space with a temperature sufficiently lower 
than 0Â°C. This method, which was widely used as the household 
refrigerator began to spread, now tends to be replaced by a 
more automatic method so as to spare the user the work of 
filling the ice tray every time it is emptied, which involves 
the risk of spilling water in the ice unit leading to the 
formation of thick "soles" of ice. Household refrigerators have therefore become known wherein 
ice is prepared by one or more trays equipped with a 
plurality of hollows being filled with water coming from the 
household water mains and channeled onto the tray by means of 
a pressure pipe equipped with an expedient solenoid valve. This solution, although satisfactory enough in its 
utilization, involves a connection to the water mains and the 
use of pipes and solenoid valves resisting the hydraulic 
mains pressure; all this involves a considerable increase in  
 
the cost of the apparatus and further cost for its 
installation. This is often unacceptable in view of the very 
competitive character of these products and the consumer's 
low inclination to pay high prices for products considered 
purely utilitarian. Furthermore the pressure of the water mains can vary between 
very high values, and if the loading of the ice tray is 
effected too soon, as usually happens, one encounters a 
number of disadvantages well known to the expert in the field 
and also to the simple user, which need not be specified here 
for the sake of brevity. It would therefore be desirable, and is the purpose of the 
present invention, to realize a refrigerator equipped with a 
device for semiautomatically preparing ice cubes that avoids 
the above-described disadvantages, without

household use, comprising a tray (1) for preparing the 

cubes equipped with a plurality of collecting elements 
(2) adapted to contain the liquid
 to be transformed 
into cubes and contained in an ice unit (3), said tray 

being rotatable so as to make the ice cubes drop out of 
the cup elements (2), and a tank (4) containing a 

multiplicity of doses for filling the tray (1), 
characterized in that the tray (1) is filled with a 

dose of liquid coming from a container (5) containing a 
fixed volume of liquid supplied by the tank (4). 
The device of claim 1, characterized in that the 
admission of liquid to the container (5) from the tank 

(4) and to the tray (1) from the container (5) takes 
place by gravity. 
The device of claim 2, characterized in that the 
admission of liquid from the tank (4) to the container 

(5) and/or from the tank to the tray takes place via 
corresponding pipes comprising stop valves (6, 7). 
The device of claim 3, characterized in that the valves 
(6, 7) are electric valves with thermal drive. 
The device of any of the above claims, characterized in 
that the inside volume of the container (5) is equipped 

with an upper outside escape. 
The device of claim 5, characterized in that the upper 
outside escape of the container (5) is a substantially 

vertical, thin, open pipe (8) that extends upward at 
least as far as the top of the tank (4). 
The device of any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that the container comprises inside a float effecting 

closure of the valve (6) for admission to the container 
(5). 
The device of any of the above claims, characterized in 
that the end-stop of rotation for discharging the tray 

(1) drives an electric switch (9). 
The device of any of the above claims, characterized in 
that the drive (T1) of the electric switch (9) causes 

the following automatic sequence: a first waiting 
period (P1), subsequent opening (T2) of the valve (6)
