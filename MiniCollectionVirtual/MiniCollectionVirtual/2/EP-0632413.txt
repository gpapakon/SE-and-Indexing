<ABSTRACT>
The confidential information being composed of symbols belonging to a first series (3), a second series of symbols (4) is defined, the first and the second series of symbols are displayed in a random relative position, and this matching is used to input the confidential information so that a third party observing the input operations cannot determine the confidential information. The invention also relates to the terminal associated with this method.

Process for entry of a confidential piece of information furnished by a
user at a terminal, this information including a plurality of signs which belong to

a first series of signs (3), characterized in that it comprises the following steps,
which consist of:


defining a second series of signs (4);
displaying the first and second series of signs on display means so that
each sign in the first series of signs will be disposed opposite a sign in the

second series of signs according to a specific correspondence, selected from
among a set of different correspondences; and
using the signs in the second series of signs, opposite which the signs
in the first series of signs composing said confidential information are disposed,

for the user's designation of the confidential information.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that a keyboard (1) is
used, which is distinct from the display means and which includes a plurality of

keys, and in that the following steps are carried out, the steps consisting of:

identifying each of the keys on a keyboard by assigning it a sign which
belongs to the second series of signs (4);
displaying the first and second series of signs on the display means in a
mutual random distribution that is known to the terminal; and 
designating the signs in the first series which compose said confidential
information by actuating each key on the keyboard (1) whose sign corresponds

to the sign in the second series (4) located opposite one of the signs in the first
series (3) constituting said confidential information.
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that at least one of the
series of signs (3,4) disappears as soon as a key on the keyboard (1) is struck.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that it includes the

following steps:

secretly defining, from among the signs in the second series (4), at least
one reference sign that is known to the terminal and to the user; and
displaying the signs in the first series of signs opposite the signs in the
second series of signs so that each time, one of the confidential signs which

compose said confidential information will be disposed opposite said reference
sign.
Process according to claim 4, characterized in that:

during the entire entry operation, the set of signs in the first series (3) is
displayed in arbitrary order;
the set of signs (3) is shifted in relation to the signs in the second series
(4) so that at least one confidential sign composing said confidential information

is disposed in front of said reference sign; and 
the user gives a validation order to the terminal when this confidential
sign is disposed in front of the reference sign.
Process according to claim 4, characterized in that a keyboard (1) with a
plurality of keys is used, each of the keys being identified by assigning it a sign

which belongs to the first series of signs (3), the display of each of the signs in
the first series (3) opposite the signs in the second series (4) being effected by

actuating the key identified by this sign, the terminal being arranged in order to
effect a comparison between the sign in the first series thus placed by the user

in front of the reference sign and at least one of the signs of the confidential
information.
Process according to claim 6, characterized in that this confidential
information includes several confidential signs arranged according to a

predetermined order (1...i...n) and, before the display of the signs in the first
series (3) by the user, the terminal gives the user a message directing the user

to place the confidential sign that is in the i position opposite the reference sign.
Process according to claim 7, characterized in that the signs in the first
series (3) which compose said confidential information are digits, and that the

terminal directs the user to place the result of a function of the digit that is in the
i position of said confidential information opposite the reference sign.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the second series of
signs (4) includes a number of distinct signs that is less than the number of

signs in the first series (3).
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the signs in the 
second series (4) are different from those in the first series (3).
Terminal including a display means and means to enter a confidential
piece of information furnished by a user, said information including a plurality of

signs which belong to a first series of signs (3), said terminal being
characterized in that it is arranged in order to display said first and a second

series of signs (4) in such a way that each sign in the first series (3) is disposed
opposite a sign in the second series (4) according to a specific correspondence,

selected from among a set of different correspondences, and it comprises:

means for using the signs in the second series (4) to allow the user to
designate the signs in the first series (3) which constitute said confidential

information; and
means for validation of the entries.
Terminal according to claim 11, characterized in that it includes a
keyboard (1) which is distinct from the display means and which is equipped

with a plurality of keys (5), each of these keys of the keyboard being identified
by means of a sign which belongs to said second series of signs (4), and in that

actuating each key of said keyboard whose sign corresponds to the sign in the
second series (4) displayed opposite one of the signs constituting said

confidential information corresponds to the entry of this sign constituting said
confidential information.
Terminal according to claim 11, characterized in that it comprises:

means for memorizing at least one reference sign known to the user 
and belonging to the second series of signs (4); and
means for permitting the user to display the signs in the first series (3)
in such a way that the signs constituting the confidential information are

disposed opposite said reference sign.
Terminal according to claim 11, characterized in that the second series of
signs (4) includes a number of distinct signs that is less than the number of

signs in the first series (3).
Terminal according to claim 11, characterized in that the signs in the
second series (4) are different from those in the first series (3).
