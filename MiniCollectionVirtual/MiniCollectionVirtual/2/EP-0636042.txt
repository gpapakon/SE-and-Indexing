<ABSTRACT>
An adjustable dumbbell (10) includes a central handle (22) which can be selectively connected to one or more outer weights (24) by means of a selector pin (26). The outer weights (24) are arranged in a nested symmetrical stack which provides for a compact construction and storage of the unused weights at the same time. The adjustable dumbbell (10) is also incrementally adjustable, and may be used either in conjunction with or as a substitute for a conventional weight stack in an exercise machine. Two additional embodiments (120 and 130) are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to exercise
equipment. More particularly, this invention pertains to
an adjustable barbell or dumbbell of improved, compact
construction.Modern dumbbells have a long and interesting
history. The earliest record of a dumbbell was the stone
"haltere" used by the ancient Greeks and Romans to train
their long jumpers. They were carried and dropped at
lift off, and it was thought that the sudden release of
the haltere resulted in the athlete jumping a greater
distance.During the 1700's and 1800's the wooden Indian club
(pin) was popular as a gentlemen's physical culture
device. These clubs were available in different weights
and like the modern fixed weight dumbbell, were complete
with a rack for storage. The heaviest Indian club was
approximately thirty-five pounds. Considering that the
athlete always grasped the club at its end, the use of a 
thirty-five pound pin was quite a demonstration of fore-arm
strength.The advent of the modern strongman in the late
1800's saw the development of the kettle bell. Like the
Indian club, this bell forced the athlete to grasp an
unbalanced weight resembling a bowling ball with a
handle. Considerable skill, balance and strength was
required to lift a kettle bell, the heaviest of which was
in the 200-300 pound range.Early balanced iron dumbbells became available after
the turn of the century, with adjustable dumbbells being
introduced by Milo Stanborn just before World War II.Today, dumbbells are generally recognized as the
most efficient of strength training devices. They allow
extreme flexibility in patterns of movement and allow the
athlete to perform a real world training regimen unlike,
for example, bungee cord exercises. Therapists like to
utilize dumbbells because they reflect of everyday
movements and their flexibility allows the patient to
train around joint and muscle trauma. Athletes that
train with dumbbells enjoy productive gains not available
with other training modalities because they require
balance and involve synergistic muscle groups to contract
during the lift. The necessity to balance the dumbbells
and coordinate movement of each hand stress the muscular
and nervous system unlike any machine exercise. With
machines, a portion of the athlete's musculature can 
actually relax due to the absence of fully balanced
coordination; ie, one side can push harder than the
other.There are two basic forms of dumbbells: fixed or
"pro-style", and adjustable dumbbells. Fixed dumbbells
are individually compact, but are typically

<CLAIMS>
An adjustable dumbbell (10,120,130) which includes a
handle (22,42), the handle including a grip (30) secured to a

pair of longitudinally spaced ends (28), the grip being
located between the said ends; at least one weight

(24,24',24'') with an end plate (34,34',34'') locatable
longitudinally outwards of a respective one of the

spaced ends; and connecting means (26,112,122) for
selectively connecting said handle and weight,

characterised in that the or each weight comprises a pair of
end plates (34,34',34''), and in that at least one interconnecting

member (36,128) joins the end plates together and holds
the end plates in a longitudinally spaced apart

relationship with the interconnecting member(s) being
separate and distinct from the handle.
An adjustable dumbbell according to claim 1
characterised in that the grip is generally centrally

located between the said spaced ends (28), and in that a
sleeve of foam material surrounds the the grip.
An adjustable dumbbell according to claim 1
characterised by at least one pair of laterally spaced

apart crosstubes (32,32',48,50) secured between the
longitudinally spaced ends (28) in spaced apart

relationship with the grip of said handle.
An adjustable dumbbell according to claim 3
characterised in that at least one of the said

crosstubes is hollow, and further including a generally
cylindrical supplemental weight (52,54) adapted for

insertion into each of the said crosstubes through a
corresponding opening in one end of said handle; and

means for selectively securing said supplemental weights
within the crosstubes of said handle. 
An adjustable dumbbell according to claim 1
characterised by a plurality of inner and outer weights

provided in a stacked and nested arrangement, each outer
weight having end plates longitudinally spaced apart

relatively more than the end plates of the next adjacent
inner weight.
An adjustable dumbbell according to claim 1
characterised by a plurality of inner and outer weights,

the end plates of each respective weight being of the
same shape and size.
An adjustable dumbbell according to claim 1
characterised by a plurality of inner and outer weight

plates, the handle ends including outward lips or
projections (33) that contact the innermost weight

plates.
An adjustable dumbbell according to claim 1
characterised in that the said means for selectively

interconnecting said handle and weight includes a pair
of longitudinally spaced apart lateral pins (25) adapted

for engagement with predetermined portions of said
handle and said weight.
An adjustable dumbbell according to claim 1
characterised by a pair of relatively smaller,

supplemental weights (38) adapted for receipt in
openings in the end plates of said weight, between said

handle and weight.
An adjustable dumbbell according to claim 1
characterised in that the means to interconnect the end

plates includes at least one longitudinally extending
member (36), and in that the means (26,112) for

selectively interconnecting the handle and weight
includes two prongs which extend perpendicularly to the

longitudinally extending hand grip (30) and in 
contacting engagement with both the means to

interconnect the end plates and a portion of the handle
whereby selectively to couple the handle and weight

together.
An adjustable dumbbell according to claim 1
characterised by a plurality of weight plates arranged

in two longitudinally spaced apart stacks, the handle
being located between the two weight plate stacks, the

said means (26,112,122) for selectively interconnecting
the handle and weight providing simultaneous

interconnection of a selected number of weight plates
from each stack to each end of the handle.
An adjustable dumbbell according to claim 1
characterised in that there is a plurality of weight

plates arranged in two longitudinally spaced apart
stacks, the handle being located between the two weight

plate stacks, in that the spaced ends abut against
innermost weight plates in each stack, and in that the

weight plates and spaced ends of the handle are angled
slightly outwardly whereby to prevent inadvertent

disconnection of the weight plates from the handle
during inversion of the dumbbell even if the means for

selectively interconnecting the handle and weight should

become disengaged.
An exercise machine (64,80) characterised in that an
adjustable dumbbell according to any of claims 1-12 is

removably mounted thereon.
