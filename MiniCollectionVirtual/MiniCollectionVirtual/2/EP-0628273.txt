<ABSTRACT>
In the case of this cashier's desk with article scanning, two parallel conveyor belt arrangements are arranged on opposite sides of a central cashdesk-mounting plate (19) and associated cashier's place. Each conveyor belt arrangement comprises a feeding belt (6), a registering belt (7) and a run-on belt (8). In the region of the registering belt (7), optical scanners (11) for reading the barcode of the articles arriving on the registering belt are attached to a height-adjustable bridge (12). The bridge (12) can be adjusted in height automatically by means of a light beam (15) as a function of the respective height (thickness) of the articles. The feeding belt (6) is narrower than the registering belt (7), so that the articles arrive substantially centrally on the registering belt (7). The conveyor belts and the scanner bridge (12) are covered by a tunnel-like hood (28) made of transparent plastic. The automatic scanning of the articles relieves the cashier, who merely performs a checking and money-taking function and is able to intervene if there are any problems.
