<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to radio broadcasting with the aid of rotatable antennae with rigid dipoles. Two separate feed channels (G1, J, 1g, 2g, 3g, 4g - G2, J, 1d, 2d, 3d, 4d) each pass through the joint (J) which separates the fixed part from the moving part of the antenna, and rise vertically within the mast so as to arrive respectively at two separate vertical groups of dipoles; it is thus possible to carry out two simultaneous transmissions from the same rotatable antenna. Application to shortwave radio broadcasting.
