<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fuel additive containing at least one unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon and at least one organic sodium compound in a quantitative ratio in which the quantity of sodium is at the most equivalent to that of the chlorine, and at least one organic solvent. The additive is introduced into liquid fuel in a quantity such that the concentration of the chlorine hydrocarbon in the fuel amounts to 0.001 - 0.2 vol % . The additive considerably reduces the pollutant emission of internal combustion engines.
