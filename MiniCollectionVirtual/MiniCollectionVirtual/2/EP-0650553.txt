<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a piston internal-combustion engine with separate compression (K) and expansion (E) chambers and a compressed-gas transfer device (7) which feeds compressed gas from the compression chambers to the expansion chambers at the beginning of ignition. A control unit (7) is provided which, depending on the mode of operation, feeds the compressed gas either to the expansion chambers or to a pressure accumulator (10) from which the expansion chambers can also be operated in a pure compressed-air mode.

<CLAIMS>
Reciprocating engine with at least one expansion 
chamber (E) defined by a respective housing and piston, 

with at least one separately provided compression chamber 
(K,K') driven thereby, with a device (3,7,4) for the 

controlled transfer of compressed air from the 
compression chambers (K,K') to the expansion chambers 

(E), which has a control device (7) which provides the 
expansion chambers (E) with air at the necessary 

pressure, and with a pressure reservoir (10) for storing 
compressed air, the compression chambers (K,K') being 

constructed to supply a pressure higher than the 
necessary pressure, characterised in that the 

reciprocating engine is so constructed that the 
compressed air is supplied to the expansion chambers (E) 

substantially at the time of the beginning of expansion 
in them and at the pressure then necessary in them, and 

that the control device (7) fills the pressure reservoir 
(10) with excess compressed air at higher pressure as a 

matter of priority and, when it is full, blows off air at 
a lower pressure level and, at least in acceleration 

phases (14,14',14") supplies the expansion chambers (E) 
directly from the pressure reservoir (10) whilst 

switching them over to compressed air motor operation. 
Reciprocating engine as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the pressure reservoir is divided 

into separately operable portions (10',10",10"'). 
Reciprocating engine as claimed in one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the pressure 

reservoir (10) is constructed in heat exchange 
relationship with the engine exhaust gases (exhaust gas  

 
line 11). 
Reciprocating engine as claimed in one of the 
preceding claims with a plurality of compression 

chambers, characterised in that the control device (7) is 
so constructed that it can blow off individual compressed 

air outlet lines (3') of the compression chambers (K') 
unthrottled.
