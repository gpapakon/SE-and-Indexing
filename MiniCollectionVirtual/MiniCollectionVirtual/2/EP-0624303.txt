<ABSTRACT>
A front projection video display system (100) achieves high contrast without darkened ambient room conditions by a specific combination and arrangement of the components of this system. These components include a front-projection video projector (10) which projects an image of particular direction of polarization; polarizing lenses (30) which polarize light radiated from room light fixtures in a direction orthogonal to that of the projected image; a polarizing filter (40) which substantially transmits light polarized parallel to the projected image and substantially blocks light orthogonal to the projected image; and a projection screen (20) which is polarization maintaining and which receives the projected image for viewing by the viewing audience.

<DESCRIPTION>
 High-Contrast Front Projection Video Display SystemHELD OF INVENTION This invention relates to a video display system, and specifically to a high- contrast video display system employing a front projection video projector.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONMany computer image, entertainment video, and video teleconferencing services require large-screen displays so that users can realize the maximal benefit and effectiveness of these services. A particular concern with large display screens, especially in residential environments, is the volume of living space encroached upon by the video display screen. A solution to this problem would be a true large- screen flat display having negligible depth that can be hung inconspicuously on the wall. This solution, although under research for many years, remains decidedly elusive.Another approach is the use of rear-projection television (RPTN) receivers which are currently available in the consumer market. RPTV receivers provide reasonable brightness and are somewhat tolerant to ambient room light while still producing good contrast However, these receivers are large in size, and significantly encroach on the volume of living space, especially for enhanced quality video formats.Another approach to large screen video displays, which minimizes the apparent loss of living space, is front projection systems. A front projection system displays an image by directing the projected light from the projector onto a projection screen which diffusely reflects the light back into the viewing area.The most pronounced advantage of front projection systems is that the video projection screen, which is a thin, wall-mountable unit, is separate from the video projector, which can be mounted in various positions within the room, thus lessening the apparent loss of living space. Front projection systems will be even more desirable as alternate video projector technologies such as liquid crystal, def ormable media or laser projection technologies are employed. By employing these technologies, the projector will shrink to an insignificant size, and the entire arrangement will approach the effectiveness and level of user comfort of a single flat-screen video display. Furthermore, in shrinking the size of the projector, it can be suspended conveniently from the ceiling of the viewing room for maximized living space and with the additional advantage that people are somewhat less likely to block the projected light as they move about the viewing room.

<CLAIMS>
What is claimed is: 1. A front-projection video display system for obtaining high contrast in a viewing room without darkened ambient conditions comprising: a front-projection video projector which projects an image in components, said components having substantially the same direction of polarization; a polarization maintaining projection screen for receiving said projected image from said video projector; a polarizing filter located between said video projector and said projection screen, said filter being polarized in the same direction as said components of said projected image; and polarizing lenses for covering light fixtures within the viewing room, said lenses being polarized orthogonal to said polarizing filter and said components of said projected image such that ambient light directed towards said projection screen is substantially blocked. 2. The front-projection video display system of claim 1 wherein said components of said projected image and said polarizing filter are substantially polarized in the horizontal direction. 3. The front-projection video display system of claim 1 wherein the polarizing filter is tilted forward away from said projection screen to prevent bright reflections from being observed by viewers. 4. The front-projection video display system of claim 3 wherein the polarizing filter is anti-reflective. 5. The front-projection video display system of claim 1 wherein said front projection video projector produces a projected image comprising three components, a first and a second component having the same polarization and a third component being orthogonally polarized to said first and second components, and wherein said projector comprises a first half-wave plate for rotating said third component into agreement with said first and second components. 6. The front-projection video display system of claim 5 wherein said projector further comprises a second half-wave plate for rotating said first, second, and third components to a particular polarization. 7. The front projection video display system of claim 1 wherein said polarizing filter follows the surface of the screen such that the surface reflections from said polarizing filter also form an image which is marginally displaced from the image formed by the surface of said screen, thereby suppressing undesirable effects of specular reflection from said polarizing filter.

 8. The front-projection video display system of claim 1 wherein said polarizing lenses reflect horizontally polarized light radiated from the light fixtures and transmits vertically polarized light radiated from the light fixtures. 9. The front-projection video display system of claim 8 wherein said polarizing lenses are comprised of multi-layers of plastic. 10. A front-projection video display system for obtaining high contrast in a viewing room without darkened ambient conditions comprising: a front-projection video projector, which projects an image in components, said components having substantially the same direction of polarization; a polarization maintaining projection screen for receiving said projected image from said video projector; and a polarizing filter located between said video projector and said projection screen, said filter being polarized in the same direction as said components of said projected image. 11. The front-projection video display system of claim 10 further comprising polarizing lenses for covering light fixtures within a viewing room, said lenses being polarized orthogonal to said polarizing filter and said components of said projected image such that ambient light radiated from said light fixtures and directed towards said projection screen is substantially blocked.
