<DESCRIPTION>
 SYSTEM OF DRUG DELIVERY TO THE LYMPHATIC TISSUESThe invention relates to diagnostic or therapeutic substances for delivering diagnostic and therapeutic agents to an area of interest, e.g., the lymphatic system.Background of the Invention It is well known that the lymphatic tissues are involved in most pathological processes. They are highly responsive even to minor disturbances in the surrounding tissues and represent a sensitive indicator of disease. The status of lymph nodes is especially important in cases of severe disease, such as metastatic cancer, where detection and accurate lymph node staging are essential to successful therapy. While histopathology is in many cases the most accurate method of lymph node assessment, this approach requires a surgical procedure and is limited to regional anatomic sites. Current techniques in medical imaging often use size criteria to assess tumor involvement of a lymph node. However, size is an imperfect indicator since normal-sized nodes may contain cancer while enlarged nodes may be cancer-free. Therefore, diagnostic preparations that selectively highlight the details of lymph node structure and function could improve both the sensitivity and specificity of major modern diagnostic methods, such as nuclear medicine, magnetic resonance imaging, and x-ray computed tomography. The efficacy of therapy, in turn, may be dramatically improved by increasing the local concentration of a drug in the injured tissue. Agents that can reach all lymph nodes after a single intravascular injection are preferable because of the large number of lymph nodes in the human body and difficult access to most of them. 

 The structure of the lymphatic system allows drug delivery to the lymph nodes by drainage of an interstitially localized preparation through the lymphatic vessels. This route has been adopted for the lymphography and imaging of the peripheral lymph nodes and has recently been suggested for administration of therapeutic preparations, such as anticancer agents immobilized on dextran molecules or on colloidal carbon particles. Previously, preparations, including carbohydrates and their derivatives, have been delivered to the lymph nodes by local (interstitial or intralymphatic) administration. The behavior of locally administered preparations in the lymphatic system depends on the type of preparation. For example, while colloids are often taken up from the lymph by the lymph node cells, some polymeric preparations, such as dextran, can pass through lymph nodes via the
