<ABSTRACT>
A web (14) of material such as photographic film is supplied continuously from a 
stock roll (16) into an infeed vacuum box (24) from which the web passes into an 

intermittently operated perforator apparatus (30) through which the web is drawn 
intermittently by a high performance vacuum drum (32) which feeds the web into an 

outfeed vacuum box (34) from which the web passes continuously to a rewind stock roll 
(44) or to other intermittently operated processing apparatus. Various patterns of widely 

spaced perforations and leader/trailer sections may be provided in the stationary web, 
which moves at high web speeds and accelerations between operations of the perforator 

apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is related to apparatus for transporting and perforating
elongated strips of material. More particularly, the invention concerns such apparatus
which is adapted for selectively producing a variety of patterns of
perforations along the length of such strips by intermittently feeding a strip and
selectively actuating a plurality of punch and die sets positioned along the path of
movement of the strip, so as to produce such patterns on strips of different lengths.In a variety of applications, elongated webs or strips of material are provided with
edge perforations which are used subsequently to drive or guide the strips through other
apparatus. For example, photographic film strips for personal cameras have long been
provided with a continuous row of evenly, closely spaced perforations along both edges
of the strips, the perforations being used during spooling of the strips, during winding of
the film through the camera and during processing of the exposed film strips. Similarly,
numerous paper products are known in which continuous rows of evenly, closely spaced
perforations are provided along the edges of the paper for use in feeding the paper
through a processing apparatus such as a printer. Apparatus and methods for producing
such continuous rows of evenly, closely spaced perforations are known, some requiring
the use of sets of punches and dies which are actuated simultaneously as the strip is
intermittently stopped for perforating; and some requiring the use of rotating drums with
punches which perforate the continuously moving strip. The strip is then cut into shorter
strips each having continuous patterns of perforations, such as strips for various numbers
of exposures in the case of photographic film products.Applications for photographic film strips and similar strip products have been
developed in recent years for which the familiar continuous rows of evenly, closely
spaced perforations are no longer needed, though other, even patterns of widely spaced
perforations are still required to indicate position along the strip or to indicate the lead or
tail end of the strip and the like. See, for example, commonly assigned U.S. Patent 
4,860,037. Because the perforations are widely spaced and groups of perforations are
separated by leader/trailer sections having no or few perforations, known apparatus of the
type previously mentioned are not suitable. In the known intermittently actuated
equipment, difficulties are encountered in moving the strips at the higher operating
speeds desired

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for perforating an elongated strip (14) of material, comprising:

an elongated, flat track plate (92) having side edges (96, 98) and a first upper surface (94);
a plurality of gas flow apertures (102) arranged along said track plate for supporting said
strip above said first upper surface;
means for directing pressurized gas through said apertures;
means for intermittently moving (24, 32, 34) said strip in said direction of movement along
said track; and
perforating means (30) having a multiplicity of punch and die sets positioned along said
track for perforating said strip when said strip is stopped by said means for intermittently

moving;

characterized in that

a) each said gas flow aperture (102) extends through and is angled relative to said first
upper surface so that the strip is supported through Bernoulli effect;
b) said means for intermittently moving said strip comprises:

a vacuum drum assembly (32) positioned at the downstream end of said track plate in
said direction of movement of said strip;
means (232) for intermittently rotating said drum to move said strip along said track
plate; and
mess (320) for measuring rotation of said drum, and
c) it further comprises means (50) for individually controlling operations of said punch and

having a plurality of die apertures spaced along said track plate opposite said strip; a

plurality of punches (84, 86, 88, 90) aligned with said die apertures; and means (168, 170,
