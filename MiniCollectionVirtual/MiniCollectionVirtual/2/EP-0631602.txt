<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polyester/ethylene 
copolymer blends and processes for preparing the same. 
More particularly, this invention relates to 
polyester/ethylene copolymer blends capable of providing 
molded articles with high notched Izod impact strength 
at temperatures near 0°C. while maintaining the chemical 
resistance, abrasion resistance, electrical and 
mechanical properties normally associated with 
polyesters. Specifically, the invention is directed to 
compositions containing poly(1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene 
terephthalate) (PCT) or copolyesters from 
terephthalic acid, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol and 
ethylene glycol, having improved impact strength at low 
temperatures due to the presence of an ethylene 
copolymer which contains repeat units from ethylene and 
at least 5 mole percent of a free radical polymerizable 
comonomer selected from the group consisting of vinyl 
acetate and an alkyl acrylate. Thermoplastic polyesters based on terephthalic acid 
and diols such as ethylene glycol and 
1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol have proven to be very 
desirable for injection molding articles for high 
strength applications. These polymers show a desirable 
balance of mechanical, thermal, electrical and 
rheological properties. However, the use of these 
polymers is limited where high impact strength at low 
temperatures is required, especially at temperatures 
near 0°C. It is, therefore, highly desirable to improve 
the low temperature impact strength of polyester blends 
used for injection molding.  
 Thermoplastic compositions exhibiting high impact 
strength are found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,562,200, 
3,580,965 and 4,172,859. U.S. Pat. No. 3,562,200 
discloses a thermoplastic composition containing 
polyethylene terephthalate having finely dispersed 
discrete particles of an amorphous or poorly crystalline 
high molecular weight copolymer of ethylene and a 
carboxylic acid ester. In contrast, the ethylene 
copolymers of the present invention have a high degree 
of crystallinity. U.S. Pat. No. 3,580,965 discloses thermoplastic 
molding compositions containing linear, saturated 
polyesters and 0.05 to 20 weight percent of copolymers 
of α-olefins and vinyl esters of saturated 
monocarboxylic acids. While the use of polyethylene 
terephthalate and polycyclohexane-1,4-dimethylol 
terephthalate polyesters are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 
3,580,965, such patent does not suggest the possibility 
of obtaining unexpected results from a polyester 
containing a combination of ethylene glycol and 
1,4-cyclohexane
