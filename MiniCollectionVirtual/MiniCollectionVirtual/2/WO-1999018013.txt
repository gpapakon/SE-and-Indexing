<ABSTRACT>
A container dome (12) with arch-like structures in elevation and polygon-shaped structures in plan. The arch-like structures are provided by pairs of chordal stiffening facets (30, 30a) disposed in an endwise adjacent array extending transversely about the periphery of the dome (12) to enhance top loading capability. Each pair of facets (30, 30a) has an inwardly-convex chordal stiffening rib (36) which defines a regular transverse polygon having an uneven number of sides to prevent dome ovalization. Preferably, multiple vertically-stacked tiers (42, 44) of facet pairs (30, 30a) arrays are utilized with each array being radially offset from adjacent tiers (42, 44).

<DESCRIPTION>
 OVALIZATION AND CRUSH RESISTANT CONTAINERField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a blow-molded plastic container having a dome specifically designed to resist ovalization and to provide improved top loading capability, and more particularly, the present invention relates to a dome configuration which is especially useful on hot, or cold, fillable wide mouth jars, or narrow neck bottles.Background of the Invention Blow-molded plastic containers are becoming more commonplace in packaging edible consumer goods such as peanut butter, pickles, applesauce and like food products. Traditionally, such products have been supplied in wide mouth glass jars which provide a relatively heavy, inflexible, sturdy container. Blow- molded plastic containers have the advantages that their light weight reduces transportation costs.Plastic containers are continually being re-designed in an effort to reduce the amount of plastic required to make the container. While there can be a savings with respect to material cost, the reduction of plastic can decrease container rigidity and structural integrity. Thus, a problem with plastic containers is that many forces act on, and alter, the as-designed shape of the container, particularly its dome configuration, from the time it is blow-molded to the time it is placed on a shelf in a store.In the packaging of food and beverage products, blow-molded plastic containers can be used in the so- called "hot-fill" process, i.e. filling the containers with a food or beverage product at an elevated temperature, sealing the containers, and then allowing the food or beverage to cool. Internal vacuum forces act on the container as a result of hot-fill processing. 

Hot-fillable plastic containers must provide sufficient flexure to compensate for the internal changes in pressure and temperature, while maintaining structural integrity and aesthetic appearance. The flexure is most commonly addressed with vacuum flex panels positioned under a label below the dome.External forces are applied to sealed containers as they are packed, shipped and stored. Filled containers are packed in bulk in cardboard boxes, or plastic wrap, or both. A bottom row of packed, filled containers may support several upper tiers of filled containers, and potentially, several upper boxes of filled containers. Therefore, it is important that the container have a top loading capability which is sufficient to prevent distortion from the intended container shape.Dome region ovalization is a common distortion
