<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an epoxy-containing
silicone resin and to a method for the
preparation thereof. The present invention provides an
epoxy-containing silicone resin that contains a
trifunctional siloxane unit (hereinafter referred to as
the T unit) and that has a distinct glass-transition
temperature in the range of -90°C to 150°C. The
present invention also relates to a curable resin
composition based on the epoxy-containing silicone
resin.T unit-containing branched silicone resins
are highly heat-resistant and have an excellent
capacity for film-formation. These resins are used as
electrical insulating materials, heat-resistant paints
and coatings, protective coatings, physical property-improvers
for curable organic resins, precursors for
copolymers (in combination with organic resin
monomers), and so forth. The epoxy-containing DT
silicone resins and the epoxy-containing DTQ silicone
resins (D = difunctional siloxane unit, T =
trifunctional siloxane unit, and Q = tetrafunctional
siloxane unit) are used as physical property-improvers
for curable epoxy resins in JP-A 56-145942, JP-A 58-53655,
and JP-A 62-27095.The epoxy-containing silicone resins proposed
in these documents are prepared either by the
cohydrolysis and condensation of epoxy-containing
trialkoxysilane and diorganodialkoxysilane or by the
base-catalyzed equilibration polymerization of cyclic
diorganosiloxane and epoxy-containing trialkoxysilane.
However, these preparative methods cause the resulting
epoxy-containing silicone resins to have broad
molecular weight distributions and hard to detect 
softening points or distinct glass-transition
temperatures. Moreover, they have poor stabilities
because their molecules contain large quantities of
silanol groups or silicon-bonded alkoxy groups. These
drawbacks serve to limit their applications. Moreover,
these methods are incapable of highly reproducible
synthesis of epoxy-containing silicone resins
characterized by controlled molecular weight
distributions, detectable softening points, and
distinct glass-transition temperatures in the range of
-90°C to 150°C.Other curable resin compositions cure to
yield resins that have excellent electrical properties
(dielectric properties, volume resistivity, and
insulation breakdown strength) and excellent mechanical
properties (flexural strength, compressive strength,
and impact strength). For this reason they are used in
the widest range of applications.However, the cured resins afforded by such
compositions are stiff and inflexible with a
