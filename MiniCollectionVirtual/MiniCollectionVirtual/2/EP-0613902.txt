<ABSTRACT>
Arylene poly(diarylphosphate) compositions can be formed by a process 
which comprises: 


(a) forming a reaction mixture comprising diaryl halophosphate and, as 
by-products, a mixture of monoaryl dihalophosphate and 

triarylphosphate, by reaction of phosphorus oxyhalide and a phenol in 
a first reactor; 
(b) if a preponderance of lower oligomers is desired, optionally 
transferring the reaction mixture from (a) to a subsequent reactor 

where at least a portion of the monoaryl dihalophosphate is recycled 
to the first reactor for reaction with the phenol contained therein to 

form additional diaryl halophosphate in the first reactor and the 
reaction mixture in (b) becomes enriched with diaryl halophosphate to 

ultimately favor the ultimate formation of a product of lower 
molecular weight distribution; and 
(c) reacting the product from (a) or (b), as selected, with an 

aromatic diol to form the arylene poly(diarylphosphate) product.

<DESCRIPTION>
Poly(hydrocarbylene aryl phosphate) compositions of the formula

where Ar is either unsubstituted or substituted aryl, A is a
hydrocarbylene bridging group comprising, for example, alkylene,
arylene, two arylene groups joined by a bridging group (e.g., -C(CH3),
-SO2 or -CO), or biarylene, and n is equal or greater than 1 are a
known class of flame retardant. Such compositions typically are a
blend of the "bis"phosphate, where n=1, and higher oligomers, where n
is an integer greater than 1. The term "poly" is used herein to
include both the "bis"phosphate composition as well as the higher
oligomers.One technique for formation of such compositions involves the initial
reaction of a phosphorus oxyhalide (e.g., phosphorus oxytrichloride)
with an aromatic diol (e.g., bisphenol A resorcinol or hydroquinone)
followed by the reaction of the resulting reaction product with, for
example, an aromatic hydroxy compound (e.g., phenol). Examples of this
route are described in U.S. Patent No. 2,520,090 and Japanese Patent
Publication Nos. 89/31,544, 57/174,331 and 88/227,632. These routes
are plagued by the large excess of phosphorus oxytrichloride needed to
achieve a high content of dimer as product, for example, and the
relatively long time needed to strip excess phosphorus oxytrichloride
from the reaction vessel. Also, the stripping of phosphorus
oxytrichloride from the reaction mixture prior to addition of phenol
for long periods of time at relatively high temperatures, to lessen
the ultimate amount of triphenyl phosphate, for example, that is 
present in the final product, can result in an undesired change in the
desired composition which results.While it is known to form compounds of the formula (Ar0)2P(0)Cl (see subscript
U.S. Patent No. 3,965,220), only a few disclosures are known to exist
in which such polyphosphate compounds are formed in which the initial
reaction is between monohydroxy compound and phosphorus oxychloride
with the second reaction step using diol as the reagent. In U.S.
Patent No. 4,133,846 it is taught in Example 4 that bis(2-chloroethyl)
chlorophosphate and pentaerythritol were to be reacted to form the
desired product. Presumably, the bis(2-chloroethyl) chlorophosphate
could be formed by reaction of phosphorus oxytrichloride and
appropriate monohydroxy compound (i.e., 2-chloroethanol). U.S. Patent
No. 3,254,973, at Col. 5, line 66 and following, illustrates
preparation of 4,4'-isopropylidene diphenol bis (di-o-tolyiphosphate)
by first reacting phosphorus oxychloride with o-cresol to form

A process for the formation of a poly(hydrocarbylene aryl phosphate)
composition which comprises:


(a) forming a reaction mixture comprising diaryl chlorophosphate
and, as by-products, a mixture of monoaryl dichlorophosphate and

(b) transferring the reaction mixture from (a) to a subsequent reactor
where at least some of the monoaryl dichlorophosphate is recycled

to the first reactor for reaction with the phenol contained therein to
form additional diaryl chlorophosphate in the first reactor and the

reaction mixture in (b) becomes enriched with diaryl
chlorophosphate to thereby ultimately favor a higher production of

lower molecular weight product; and
(c) reacting the product from (b) with an aromatic diol to form the
arylene poly(diarylphosphate) product.
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the phenol is
unsubstituted phenol.
A process according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the aromatic diol is resorcinol.
