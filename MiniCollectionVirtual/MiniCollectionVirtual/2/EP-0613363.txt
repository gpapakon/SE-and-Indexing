<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to disposable garments having 
fixed sides, which are placed in position on the wearer by 
inserting the wearer's legs into the leg openings and sliding the 
disposable garment into position about the wearer's lower torso. 
Examples of such disposable garments would include disposable 
underwear for children (eg., toddlers) or adults, and disposable 
panties which may be used with catamenial devices such as tampons 
or sanitary napkins. The present invention relates more 
particularly to disposable absorbent articles such as training 
pants, incontinent garments (panties or briefs), and the like, 
having elasticized ear flaps. Infants and other incontinent individuals wear disposable 
absorbent articles to receive and contain urine and other bodily 
exudates. Absorbent articles having fixed sides, e.g. disposable 
training pants, have been popular for use on toilet-training 
children. Currently, training pants must be manufactured in 
several different sizes to accommodate the different size 
children of toilet-training age. Accordingly, to adequately meet 
the consumers needs, a manufacturer of disposable training pants 
must have several different sets of manufacturing equipment to 
produce the various sizes. It is, therefore, very desirable to  
 
have a design that would allow the manufacturer to make a 
one-size-fits-all training pant which will substantially meet the 
consumers needs by fitting a very broad range of child sizes. 
This requires that the training pant fit snugly about the waist 
and legs of smaller children without drooping, sagging or sliding 
down from its position about the lower torso, and must fit larger 
children without causing irritation to the skin about the waist, 
legs and crotch. Therefore, the disposable training pants must 
be elastically extensible about the waist and legs of the wearer, 
and the elastic elements must have a high degree of stretch. Prior training pants have been made elastically extensible 
using elastic elements disposed in the training pants such that 
the waist opening and leg openings are at least partially 
encircled with elasticized bands. This method of using elastic 
elements is shown in U.S. Patents 4,205,679 to Repke, et al.; 
4,610,680 to LaFleur; 4,610,681 to Strohbeen, et al.; 4,641,381 
to Heran, et al.; 4,909,804 to Douglas, Sr.; and 4,960,414 to 
Meyer. Although training pants made according to these methods 
will allow the absorbent articles to fit slight variations in 
waist size and slight variations in

therewith to form an elastomeric laminate; 

characterized in that each said ear flap is an 
elasticized ear flap (30) formed by mechanically 

stretching each said elastomeric laminate such that 
each said ear flap is permanently elongated and each 

said elastomeric laminate is elastically extensible in 
the direction of initial stretching, once the initial 

stretching forces are removed from said elastomeric 
laminate. 
The garment of claim 1, wherein each of said seams 
(10) comprises a mass of fused polymeric material 

which extends from the garment 1.6mm (1/16 of an inch) 
or less.  

 
The garment of claim 1 or 2, wherein each of said 
seams comprises a splice between said front portion 

(56) and said rear portion (58). 
The garment of any preceding claim, wherein each of 
said ear flaps comprises a crosslinked natural rubber 

foam. 
The garment of any preceding claim, wherein said 
chassis (14) is a laminate comprising an outer layer 

(48) and an inner layer (46) secured to said outer 
layer, and said elastic ear flap members (90) are 

interposed between said outer layer and said inner 
layer of said chassis. 
The garment of claim 5, wherein said inner layer is 
comprised of a liquid pervious nonwoven that forms a 

topsheet (24). 
The garment of claim 6, wherein said inner layer and 
said outer layer are each comprised of a 100% 

polymeric nonwoven. 
The garment of any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein said 
chassis (14) additionally comprises an absorbent 

assembly (22) secured to said inner layer (46), said 
absorbent assembly preferably comprising a topsheet 

(24), a backsheet (26) secured to said topsheet, and 
an absorbent core (28) interposed between said 

topsheet and said backsheet, said backsheet being 
secured to said inner layer (46). 
A method of making an elasticized disposable garment 
(20) according to claim 1, comprising the steps of: 


(a) providing a chassis (14) comprising a front 
portion (56) having longitudinal side regions, ear  

 
flaps (72), and a waistband (34), said ear flaps being 

elongatable; a rear portion (58) opposed to said
