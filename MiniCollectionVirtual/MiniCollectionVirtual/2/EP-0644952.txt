<ABSTRACT>
Methods of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) are disclosed wherein high quality films are deposited on patterned wafer substrates (14). In the methods, a patterned wafer (14) is rotated about an axis thereof in a CVD reaction chamber (10) and reactant gases are directed into the reaction chamber (10) and toward the patterned wafer substrate (14) in a direction generally perpendicular to the plane of rotation of the wafer. The reaction chamber (10) is maintained at a suitable pressure and the wafer is heated to a suitable temperature whereby a high quality film is deposited by CVD on the patterned wafer substrate (14). The process is applicable to deposit elemental films, compound films, alloy films and solid solution films, and is particularly advantageous in that high film deposition rates and high reactant conversion rates are achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to chemical 
vapor deposition (CVD) methods for producing 
semiconductor wafers, and, more particularly, to 
methods for depositing films on patterned wafer 
substrates which achieve enhanced film deposition 
rates and reactant conversion rates without 
sacrificing film quality. In the manufacture of semiconductor devices, 
certain coating processes are performed by chemical 
vapor deposition (CVD). The two general types of CVD 
processes are blanket and selective CVD. In blanket 
CVD, desired film coatings are deposited over the 
entire exposed surface of the semiconductor wafer. In 
selective CVD, desired film coatings are applied to 
the exposed surfaces of the contact or via holes which 
pass through the insulative layers on the 
semiconductor wafers; e.g., to provide plugs of  
 
conductive material for the purpose of making 
interconnections across the insulating layers. Frequently, the desired ultimate result of 
CVD processes is for filling holes or vias and for 
forming interconnections between layers on 
semiconductor wafers. This can be accomplished in one 
of two ways: 1) formation of the desired film coating 
on only selected portions of the wafer surfaces by 
selective deposition; and 2) blanket film deposition 
with subsequent etching. Because direct selective 
application by CVD of film coatings may be unreliable, 
unsuccessful, and/or slow, and thus undesirable on a 
commercial scale where rapid throughput and efficient 
use of expensive machinery is important, selective 
coatings are often achieved by blanket deposition and 
subsequent etching back from the areas where permanent 
coating is not desired. When utilizing blanket CVD 
followed by etching back of the deposited material, a 
high degree of thickness uniformity in the blanket 
coating is required, particularly in the areas where 
the deposited material is to be etched. If the film 
coating thickness is irregular in the etched-back 
areas, the etching process may selectively damage the 
underlying layers or may result in regions where 
residual coating remains. Known blanket CVD processes 
of the prior art have coated substrates with limited 
uniformity and/or at limited speed. Accordingly,  
 
processes for the application of blanket coatings of 
acceptable thickness uniformity and at relatively 
higher speeds are required. To uniformly apply coatings such as tungsten 
(W) by CVD to semiconductor wafers, it is desirable to 
ensure a uniform supply of reactant gases across the 
surface of the
