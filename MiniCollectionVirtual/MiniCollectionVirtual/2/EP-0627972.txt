<ABSTRACT>
By a method for accurately joining together two sheet sections (1, 2) along edges (3, 4) thereof having complementary shapes, the edge of at least one sheet section is formed by means of a numerically controlled machine with the sheet section fixed in a fixture by moving a cutting member relative to the sheet section according to a predetermined path or curve. The complementary edges (3, 4) of the two sheet sections are then made to abut each other. The two sheet sections are subsequently welded together in a numerically controlled machine, said one sheet section being fixedly retained in said fixture and the knowledge of the path used during cutting is used to determine the path of the welding means at the welding of the sheet sections. The complementary edges (3, 4) are arranged in at least one projecting area (5) on a first sheet section (1) and the complementary areas have interlocking shapes, preferably trapezoidal, for preventing a mutual displacement of the sheet sections at least in directions parallel to the surfaces thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of the type described
in the preamble to claim 1.In the fabrication of motor vehicles it is known to join
two sheet sections by a trimming of the edge of a first
sheet section is carried out in a numerically controlled
laser cutting/welding machine, said first sheet section
being fixedly retained in a fixture, whereafter a second
sheet section, which is also fixed in the said fixture,
is cut along an edge and the two edges are brought into
abutment for a subsequent welding together of the sheet
sections. The fixture used at said method is very strong
and comparatively complicated construction.German patent No. 1.119.057 discloses joining of two
metal strips by forming a dovetailed protrusion in the
first strip and forming a complementary tab in the second
strip, which are subsequently brought into engagement
with each other. The two sections are then connected by
means of welding, for instance by resistance spot welding.
The object is to hold the ends of the two strips
together to form a coherent strip at a subsequent processing
thereof.US-A-1,773,068 a method of joining two metal sheets
comprising the steps of cutting matched interlocking
teeth in the abutting edges of the sheets, placing the
toothed edges of the sheets in such a manner that the 
teeth interlock, and finally applying heat and pressure
along a zone common to both sheets and wide enough to
include the teeth of each sheet to weld the edge portions
of the sheets together. The welding method used i resistance
welding.Finally, from US-A 3,091,844 it is known to provide the
ends of strips of metal with complementary dovetailed
protrusions and tabs for keeping the strips together
during a subsequent compression of the joint and in a
subsequent processing in a roller. Thus, no accurate
joining of sheet parts is disclosed.The object of the invention is to provide a method of the
type stated in the introduction enabling an accurate weld
joint of sheet sections by means of more simple fixtures
than hitherto.The method according to the invention is characterised by
the features of the characterizing part of claim 1. Due
to the accurate geometrical interlocking, the stress
produced by the heat during welding are absorbed by the
inter-gripping areas of the sheet sections. As the sheet
sections thus merely are to be controlled transversely to
their surface, much simpler and less strong fixtures may
be used than hitherto. At the same time, the accurate
geometrical interlocking ensures that 
a minimal and accurate joint
