<ABSTRACT>
A micro-flow controlling pump (1) according to the 
present invention is used for controlling a micro-flow of 

a liquid in an experiment using a chemical agent for 
examining permeability of a membrane, reaction of a flow 

system, reflux of vital tissues, or the like. The micro-flow 
controlling pump includes: a pump body (2) formed to 

have a cylindrical wall and a bottom surface, and be 
provided with an outflow tube (22) formed at an outer surface 

of the cylindrical wall; a cover body (3) formed to be detachably 
attached to the pump body (2) and be provided with 

an inflow tube (32); a magnet rotator (4) arranged inside the pump 
body (2); and a magnet stirrer (5) arranged outside the pump 

body (2), having magnetic force by which the magnet rotator (4) 
in the pump body (2
) can be rotated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a micro-flow controlling 
pump to be used for controlling a micro-flow of 
a liquid in an experiment using a chemical agent for 
examining permeability of a membrane, reaction of a flow 
system, reflux of vital tissues, or the like. Generally, an experiment for examining permeability 
of a flowing membrane, or the like necessitates it to 
control a micro-flow of a liquid. For purpose of controlling the micro-flow, what is 
called an ironing pump has conventionally been utilized. 
According to this ironing pump, an elastic tube body made 
of silicon rubber or the like is subject to an ironing 
process using a roller, etc.; and a liquid is fed through 
this elastic tube body. Such an ironing pump has been 
disclosed in Japanese TOKKYO KOKAI No. 58-101282 for 
example. However, such a conventional ironing pump has a 
problem that the liquid inevitably pulses through the 
tube body, influence of which cannot be neglected for 
controlling the micro-flow. To overcome the problem, it 
has been proposed to improve the ironing process using 
the roller and reduce the degree of pulsation of the  
 
liquid. However, this makes the resulting pump complicated 
in structure and inevitably leads to a high manufacturing 
cost. Moreover, in a case of feeding a chemical liquid 
which is made by diluting a chemical agent to a low 
density, there arises another problem that the chemical 
liquid may be absorbed by the elastic tube body through 
the feed, and the thus absorbed chemical liquid may be 
dissolved again in another chemical liquid, thereby 
making it impossible to accurately watch behavior of the 
chemical agent, or the like. The present invention, which is made considering the 
above problems of prior art, has an object to provide a 
micro-flow controlling pump for simply and accurately 
controlling a micro-flow of a liquid without being influenced 
by absorption or dissolution of the liquid. The micro-flow controlling pump of the present 
invention is used for controlling a micro-flow of a 
liquid in an experiment using a chemical agent for examining 
permeability of a membrane, reaction of a flow 
system, reflux of vital tissues, or the like. The micro-flow 
controlling pump includes: a pump body formed to 
have a cylindrical wall and a bottom surface, and be 
provided with an outflow tube formed at an outer surface 
of the cylindrical wall; a cover body formed to be detachably 
attached to the pump body and be provided with  
 
an inflow tube; a magnet rotator arranged inside
