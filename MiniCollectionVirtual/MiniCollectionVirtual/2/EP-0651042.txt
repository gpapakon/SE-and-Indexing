<ABSTRACT>
In this process, pressurised (compressed) gases are purified by low-temperature gas scrubbing and subsequent degassing of the laden scrubbing liquid by depressurisation, evacuation, stripping and heating. The present process is suitable for use in Rectisol plants for removing, in particular, metal carbonyl compounds. In the process, before entry into a regeneration column (6), a heavily laden and a lightly laden part-stream of the scrubbing liquid are heated and each is fed to a reactor (3, 4) and the lightly laden part-stream of the scrubbing liquid together with the condensate which arises in the course of the partial condensation of the vapours in the condensation system (7) of the regeneration column (6) is passed into a delay reactor (4).

Method of purifying pressurized gases by low-temperature
gas scrubbing and subsequently outgassing the

laden scrubbing liquid by pressure release, evacuation,
stripping and heating, characterized in that, before

entering a regenerating column (6), a heavily laden and
a lightly laden substream of the scrubbing liquid are

heated and each fed to a reactor (3, 4) and in that the
lightly laden substream of the scrubbing liquid is fed

into the residence-time reactor (4) together with the
condensate which is produced in the course of the partial

condensation of the vapours in the condensation system
(7) of the regenerating column (6).
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the condensation system (7) of the regenerating column

(6) is made up of two condensation stages.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that unladen scrubbing methanol or, alternatively, make-up

methanol is injected as scrubbing liquid into the gas
phase for the second low-temperature condensation stage

of the regenerating column 6.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the reactor (4) is operated at a

pressure which corresponds approximately to the boiling
point of the combined reactor inlet streams.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the reactor (4) is operated at a

temperature of 50 to 180Â°C, a pressure of 5 to 25 bar and
a residence time of 0.05 to 1 h.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the lightly laden substream of the 

scrubbing liquid from reactor (4), optionally together
with flash gases from reactor (3), is fed to a flash

container (5) whose vapours are fed via condensation
system (7).
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the liquid phase of flash container

(5) is recirculated to reactor (4).
