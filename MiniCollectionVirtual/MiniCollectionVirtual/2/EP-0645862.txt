<ABSTRACT>
A spring clip 1 is provided for use in fastening 
together a pair of components 2,3 having aligned apertures. 

The spring clip has an elongate spring strip part (10) and, 
at one end, a depending spacer 11 and flange 12. At the 

other end there is a depending, generally V-shaped, clip 
part 13 and the free end of one leg 15 of this has a recess 

or aperture 18 adjacent to its edge to allow, in use, 
insertion of a tool for compression of the clip part. An 

inwardly extending abutment 16 is provided to engage the 
other leg 14 of the clip part when it is compressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spring clip 
fastener and, more particularly, to such a fastener 
intended for use in a cable tray to fasten a component in 
or on the tray. Cable trays and component parts are often assembled by 
means of elongate spring clips which pass through aligned 
pairs of respective apertures in the component and the 
tray. The spring clip may comprise an elongate spring 
strip part; at one end, a depending spacer and flange; and, 
at the other end, a depending, generally V-shaped, clip 
part which has a pair of legs, the free end of one of which 
engages the rear of the cable tray to latch the spring clip 
in position. Such a clip is disclosed in EP-A-0 599 634, 
published 1/6/94, filed 24/11/93 and claiming 
priorities 24/11/92 (GB 9 224 545), 11/2/93 (GB 9 302 759) and 
24/9/93 (GB 9 319 779). Problems with such a clip arise on removal or 
release of the spring clip. Firstly, as there is often no 
access to the rear of the cable tray, it is difficult to 
compress the legs of the V-shaped clip part in order to 
release the spring clip and, secondly, partly as a result, 
the legs may be compressed beyond their elastic limit, 
preventing satisfactory re-use. Other types of clip with 
a broadly similar operative action are shown in FR-A-2 
540 946 which discloses a spring clip with an elongate spring 
strip part having at each end a depending generally V-shaped clip 
part & WO-A-92 04755 
which discloses a spring clip of spring steel rod bent into a V-shape to form a pair of 
parallel elongate spring rod parts, the apex of the V having a right-angled step forming 
a depending spacer and flange and the extremities of the rods having clip parts. The present invention sets out to overcome the above 
mentioned problems and, accordingly, there is provided a 
spring clip for fastening together a pair of components 
having aligned apertures, the spring clip having an 
elongate spring strip part; at one end, a depending spacer 
and flange; and, at the other end, a depending, generally 
V-shaped, clip part, the free end of one leg of which has 
a recess or aperture adjacent to its edge to allow, in use, 
insertion of a tool for compression of the clip part and an 
abutment extending inwardly to engage the other leg of the 
clip part when it is compressed. The recess or aperture and the abutment may be 
provided by an inturned substantially C-shaped flange. The invention also includes a retaining flag which can  
 
be inserted into the gap between the legs of the V-shaped 
clip. The flag

<CLAIMS>
A spring clip (1) for fastening together a pair of 
components (2,3) having aligned apertures, the spring clip 

having an elongate spring strip part (10); at one end, a 
depending spacer (11) and flange (12); and, at the other 

end, a depending, generally V-shaped, clip part (13), the 
free end of one leg (15) of which has a recess or aperture 

(18) adjacent to its edge to allow, in use, insertion of a 
tool for compression of the clip part and an 

abutment (16) extending inwardly to engage the other leg of the clip 
part when it is compressed. 
A clip according to claim 1, wherein the recess or 
aperture and the abutment are provided by an inturned 

substantially C-shaped flange (16). 
A clip according to claim 1 or claim 2, comprising a 
retaining flag (20) which can be inserted into the gap 

between the legs (14,15) of the V-shaped clip part (13). 
A clip according to claim 3, wherein the flag (20) is 
dimensioned so as to be capable of insertion only when the 

V-shaped clip part (13) is fully engaged with the components 
(2,3) and is an interference fit with the V-shaped clip part.
