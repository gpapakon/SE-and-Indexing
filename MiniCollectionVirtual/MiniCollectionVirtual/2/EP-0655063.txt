<DESCRIPTION>
Renin-inhibiting compounds are known for
control of hypertension. Of particular interest herein
are compounds useful as renin inhibiting agents.Renin is a proteolytic enzyme produced and
secreted into the bloodstream by the juxtaglomerular
cells of the kidney. In the bloodstream, renin cleaves a
peptide bond in the serum protein angiotensinogen to
produce a decapeptide known as angiotensin I. A second
enzyme known as angiotensin converting enzyme, cleaves
angiotensin I to produce the octapeptide known as
angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent pressor agent
responsible for vasoconstriction and elevation of
cardiovascular pressure. Attempts have been made to
control hypertension by blocking the action of renin or
by blocking the formation of angiotensin II in the body
with inhibitors of angiotensin I converting enzyme.Classes of compounds published as inhibitors of
the action of renin on angiotensinogen include renin
antibodies, pepstatin and its analogs, phospholipids,
angiotensinogen analogs, pro-renin related analogs and
peptide aldehydes.A peptide isolated from actinomyces has been
reported as an inhibitor of aspartyl proteases such as
pepsin, cathepsin D and renin [Umezawa et al, in J.
Antibiot. (Tokyo), 23, 259-262 (1970)]. This peptide, 
known as pepstatin, was found to reduce blood pressure in
vivo after the injection of hog renin into nephrectomized
rats [Gross et al, Science,175, 656 (1971)]. Pepstatin
has the disadvantages of low solubility and of inhibiting
acid proteases in addition to renin. Modified pepstatins
have been synthesized in an attempt to increase the
specificity for human renin over other physiologically
important enzymes. While some degree of specificity has
been achieved, this approach has led to rather high
molecular weight hepta- and octapeptides [Boger et al,
Nature, 303, 81 (1983)]. High molecular weight peptides
are generally considered undesirable as drugs because
gastrointestinal absorption is impaired and plasma
stability is compromised.Short peptide aldehydes have been reported as
renin inhibitors [Kokubu et al, Biochim, Biophys, Res,
Commun., 118, 929 (1984); Castro et al, FEBS Lett., 167,
273 (1984)]. Such compounds have a reactive C-terminal
aldehyde group and would likely be unstable in vivo.Other peptidyl compounds have been described as
renin inhibitors. EP Appl. #128,762, published
18 December 1984, describes dipeptide and tripeptide
glyco-containing compounds as renin inhibitors [also see
Hanson et al, Biochm, Biophys, Res, Comm.,132, 155-161
(1985), 146,
