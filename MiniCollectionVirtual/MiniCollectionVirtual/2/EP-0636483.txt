<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming
apparatus for recording an image on a recording medium.In this case, as image forming apparatuses, an
electrophotographic copying machine, a laser beam printer
(LBP), an LED printer, a facsimile apparatus, a
wordprocessor, and the like are included.The background art of the present invention will be
described below.In recent years, a demand has arisen for a smaller
image forming apparatus with improved operability. In
order to satisfy such a demand on the market, the
applicant of the present invention has previously made
effective inventions, and discloses them in Japanese
Patent Application No. 60-123060 (Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open No. 61-279871; corresponding
USP 4,873,548) and Japanese Patent Application No. 63-047637
(Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 01-222269;
corresponding USP 5,047,803).Japanese Patent Utility Model Laid-Open No.
42167/1991 discloses an image forming apparatus in which
a process cartridge can be removably mounted and in which
laser light emitting means emit an upwardly inclined beam
of laser light. The present invention is an improvement on these
previous inventions so as to provide an image forming
apparatus which realizes a further reduction in size and
improved operability.In accordance with the present invention there is
provided image forming apparatus as set out in claim 1.In order that the present invention may be more
readily understood, embodiments thereof will now be
described by way of example and with reference to the
accompanying drawings, in which:
Fig. 1 is a sectional side view of a laser beam
printer to which an embodiment of the present invention
is applied.Fig. 2 is a perspective view showing the outer
appearance of the laser beam printer in Fig. 1;Fig. 3 is a perspective view showing the interior
of the laser beam printer in Fig. 1;Fig. 4 is a plan view of a portion near a composite
electric circuit board;Fig. 5 is a partially cutaway perspective view of
a portion of an opening/closing cover;Fig. 6 is a side view showing an ordinary state
wherein a process cartridge is mounted; Fig. 7 is a schematic functional block diagram;Fig. 8 is a sectional side view of an example of a laser beam
printer;Fig. 9 is a sectional side view of a portion near
an electric equipment unit; andFig. 10 is a perspective view showing a method of
mounting an AC inlet.An image forming apparatus according to an
embodiment of the present invention will be described
below with reference to the accompanying drawings.Fig.
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An image forming apparatus for forming an image on
a recording medium, said apparatus comprising:


mounting means for removably mounting within the
main body of the apparatus a process cartridge (B), which

process cartridge includes an electrophotographic
photosensitive member (7) and process means (8, 10, 11)

acting on said photosensitive member to form a toner
image thereon;

light emitting means is located beneath said recording

medium receiving means and within the vertical height of
said process cartridge when the latter is mounted in said

body, and is adapted in operation to emit laser light
obliquely upwardly in the same direction as the inclined

portion of said recording medium receiving means. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, wherein said laser
light emitting means is adapted to emit a beam of laser

light obliquely upwardly at an angle of about 9 to 12.5
degrees with respect to the horizontal.
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding
claims wherein said laser light emitting means comprise

a laser diode (1b), a polygonal mirror (1c) for
reflecting light from said diode, and an imaging lens

(1e).

claims wherein said feed cassette extends beneath said

laser beam emitting means, beneath said fixing means and
beneath said process cartridge when the process cartridge

is mounted in the apparatus.
Apparatus according to claim 5, wherein said laser
beam emitting means is located above a guide for the

recording medium which extends from the transfer position
to said fixing means.
Apparatus according to claim 6, wherein an electric
circuit board (16) is arranged beneath said laser beam

emitting means.
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims wherein said feed cassette is removably mountable

within the apparatus, and the arrangement of the
apparatus is such that removal/mounting of said process

cartridge and said feed cassette are carried out on the
same side of said apparatus.
Apparatus according to claim 8, wherein a recording
medium conveyed into said recording medium receiving

means by said conveying means is removable by an operator
from said same side of the apparatus.
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding
claims and incorporated in one of the following:-


a facsimile apparatus; a laser printer, and LED
printer or an electrophotographic copying machine.
