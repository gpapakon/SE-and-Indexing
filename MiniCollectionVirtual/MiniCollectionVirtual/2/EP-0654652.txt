<ABSTRACT>
Process in an encoder unit comprising a code means (30) 
provided with a pattern and a detector means (40) as well 

as an encoder unit for carrying out the process. The detector 
means (40) and the code means (30) are displaceable relative 

to each other, and the process comprises the step of generating 
a measurement code signal (84,d1-d12) indicating the 

position of the code means (30) relative to the detector 
means (40) with a certain inaccuracy. The process further 

comprises the steps of reading at least one bit track (Ta1; 
Td1) on the code means (30) and generating an accessory code 

signal (86) comprising at least one accuracy bit signal (ia1) 
with a first significance, signal edges for the accessory 

code signal (86,ia1,ia3,ia6) occurring at approximately the 
same position as signal edges of bit signals (d2-d12) in 

the measurement code signal (84,d1-d12);
 

and combining the measurement code signal (84) and the 
accessory code signal (86), thus providing a code signal 

(45;84,86) with an accuracy redundance. As a function of 
the code signal (45), an absolute position signal (75,b1-b12) 

is generated, which indicates the absolute position of the 
code means relative to the detector means (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process of the type 
described in the preamble to claim 1, and a device for 
carrying out said process. Electro-optical encoders for indicating angular position can 
comprise an encoder disc with a pattern which can be read 
optically. The pattern on the disc is read by one or more 
detectors, each of which emits an electrical signal related 
to the angular displacement or rotation of the encoder disc. The encoder disc can be either an absolute encoder disc or 
an incremental encoder disc. An incremental encoder disc is 
provided with a periodic pattern, e.g. a plurality of light 
and dark areas of equal size. When the incremental encoder 
disc is rotated, the transition between dark and light areas 
can be detected and thus a change in the angular position. 
An absolute encoder disc, however, is provided with a pattern 
which is unique for each angular position. Thus, when an 
absolute encoder disc is read, the absolute angular position 
of the encoder disc can be determined. The pattern on the 
absolute encoder disc comprises alternating light and dark 
areas which provide information concerning values in a signal 
which is fed from a detector means which reads the pattern 
on the absolute encoder disc. The absolute encoder disc thus comprises a plurality of 
groups of patterns, where each group corresponds to a certain 
bit such as d1, d2 etc, in the code signal which is generated 
by the sensor means. Each pattern group is read by a separate 
detector element. In order to obtain a certain accuracy in 
the code signal generated, according to a known technology, 
the reading of each pattern group must be of the same accuracy. 
That is to say, in order to be able to determine for  
 
example when a change has occurred in the detector reading 
the most significant bit, also called the msb-detector, the 
msb-detector must produce its signal with the same accuracy 
as the accuracy when reading the least significant bit (lsb). 
An example of a code means with a pattern for reading the 
absolute position according to known technology is shown 
in Figure 10. A problem of the known technology is that in order to increase 
the resolution of the code signal, the accuracy in 
reading the pattern must also be correspondingly increased. 
This increased accuracy requirement is placed on the reading 
of all the pattern groups, i.e. both the msb group and the 
1sb group and the pattern groups of intermediate significance. An additional problem is that increased accuracy requires 
tha
