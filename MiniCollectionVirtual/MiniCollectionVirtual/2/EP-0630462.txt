A combustion apparatus using solid or solid/liquid fuels 
comprising a body or outer case (1) in the lower part of which 

is housed a firebox made up of a grate assembly (2) comprising 
at least two superimposed grates, characterised by the fact that 

at least two superimposed grates (2a, 2b) of this assembly 
comprise flat bars (2c) slanted around their longitudinal axis. 
A combustion apparatus according to claim 1, characterised 
by the fact that the bottom part of the slanted flat bars (2c') 

of the upper grate (2a) is positioned over the top part of the 
slanted flat bars (2c") of the lower grate (2b). 
A combustion apparatus according to either of claims 1 or 
2, characterised by the fact that the flat bars (2c') of the 

upper grate (2a) have an inverse slant to that of the flat bars 
(2c") of the lower grate (2b). 
A combustion apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised by the fact that at least the flat bars of one of 

the grates, and preferably, the flat bars (2c") of the lower 
grate (2b) have an adjustable slant, and that the said apparatus 

comprises means (12-13-14-15-16) whereby this slope can be 
adjusted. 
A combustion apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
comprising a tubular body (4) installed vertically in the upper 

part of the body or outer case (1), above and at a distance from 
the superimposed grate assembly (2), this inner body being open 

at its base and delimiting a central cavity (4c) constituting, 
at the same time, a reservoir for solid fuel and a distillation 

chamber around the lower part of which is fitted a combustion 
chamber (6) for gases produced by the distillation, char
acterised 
by the fact that the said assembly of superimposed grates (2) is 

mounted with a capability of vertical movement, so that it is 
possible to regulate the distance between the base of the said 

inner body (4) and the upper grate (2a) of the said assembly (2), 
the said apparatus comprising means (18, 19) permitting the  

 
position of the grate assembly (2) to be adjusted. 
A combustion apparatus according to claim 5, characterised 
by the fact that a movable grate (20) is positioned vertically 

around the lower part (4a) of the inner body (4) and that this 
peripheral grate (20) is supported by the movable assembly of 

superimposed grates (2) with which it is integral in vertical 
movement. 
A combustion apparatus according to either of claims 5 or 
6, characterised by the fact that the lower part (4a) of the 

inner body (4) is provided with multiple holes (4b) for the 
passage of gas produced in the distillation. 
A combustion apparatus according to any of claims 5 to 7, 
comprising an aerator (5) made up of an annular duct positioned 

around and at a distance from the lower part (4a) of the inner 
body (4) and the peripheral grate (20), in such a manner as to 

form an annular combustion chamber (6) for the distillation 
gases, characterised by the fact that this aerator (5) is 

integral with the superimposed grate assembly (2) in its vertical 
movements. 
A combustion apparatus according to claim 8, characterised 
by the fact that the inner side of the aerator (5) has two walls 

(5a, 5d) separated by a space, provided with multiple holes and 
delimiting an air distribution chamber; the holes (5f) of the 

inner wall (5d) having a diameter greater than that of the holes 
(5g) of the outer wall (5a). 
A combustion apparatus according to any of claims 5 to 9, 
characterised by the fact that it comprises a flame arrester 

device or heat distributor (26) made up of a perforated plate 
positioned between the outer case (1) and the inner body (4), 

above and at a distance from the movable unit (2-20-5) of the 
apparatus. 
A combustion apparatus according to claim 1, comprising one 
or more ash boxes, characterised by the fact that this ash box  

 
or each ash box (3a, 3b) has, firstly, a movable rear wall (3c) 

towards the front and, secondly, a front wall (3e) provided with 
an opening (3f) to which to an aspirator (A) can be connected. 
A combustion apparatus according to claim 11, characterised 
by the fact that the rear movable wall (3c) of the ash box(es) 

(3a, 3b), is mounted so as to be able to tilt around a horizontal 
axis (x-x). 
A combustion apparatus according to either of claims 11 or 
12, characterised by the fact that the ash box or each ash box 

(3a, 3b) is provided, at its front part, with a fixed vertical 
wall (29), provided with openings (30) partially delimited by the 

bottom (3g) of the ash box or boxes. 
A combustion apparatus according to either of claims 8 or 
9, characterised by the fact that the aerator (5) is made in two 

parts (5b, 5c) separate from each other.
