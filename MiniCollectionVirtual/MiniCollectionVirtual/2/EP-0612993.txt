<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for exchanging measurement and/or sampling probes (3) which, after removal from a probe magazine (2), can be plugged onto a contact tube (5) arranged at the bottom end of a sub-lance (4). In order to be able to enable a probe exchange in the shortest time, it is proposed that a gripper (14) be provided for seizing a probe (3), the gripper being connected via a joint (13) to an extension arm (12), that the extension arm (12) can be displaced in the manner of a telescope by means of a drive unit (11), that the drive unit (11) be arranged so as to be moved by means of at least two piston-cylinder units (9) on a rotatable and height-adjustable table (8), and that a control device (23) be provided for controlling the device (1).

<CLAIMS>
Device for changing measuring and/or sampling probes (3), which after removal from a
probe magazine (2) are mountable on a contact tube (5) disposed at the lower end of an

immersion lance (4), wherein a gripper (14) is provided for grasping a probe (3), which
gripper is displaceable via a hinge (13) with a cantilever (12) by means of a drive unit,

characterised in that the drive unit (11) is disposed by at least three piston cylinder units (9)
movably on a rotary and height-adjustable table (8), in that for controlling the device (1) a

control device (23) is provided, and in that each piston cylinder unit (9) is controllable
separately by the control device (23).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the drive unit (11) is connected in the
region of its corners movably to the table (8) via four piston cylinder units (9).
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the table (8), the drive unit (11), the
cantilever (12), the hinge (13) and the gripper (14) are each controllable independently of

one another by the control device (23).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the probe magazine (2) has
a number of probe grooves (15) for receiving the probes (3).
