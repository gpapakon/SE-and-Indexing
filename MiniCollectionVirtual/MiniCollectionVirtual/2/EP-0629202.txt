<ABSTRACT>
Avermectin and milbemycin derivatives such as formula (I) having a double bond at the 3-4 position and a cyano substituent at the 3-position have outstanding anthelmintic properties. They may be prepared by allowing an avermectin or milbemycin derivative having a leaving group at the 5-position, or having double bonds at the 2-3 and 4-5 positions and no substituent at the 5-position, to react with an ionic cyanide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to antiparasitic agents and 
in particular to compounds related to the avermectins and 
milbemycins but having a cyano substituent at the 3-position 
and lacking a substituent at the 5-position. The avermectins are a group of broad-spectrum 
antiparasitic agents referred to previously as the C-076 
compounds. They are produced by fermenting a certain 
strain of microorganism Streptomyces avermitilis in an 
aqueous nutrient medium. The preparation and structure 
of these compounds obtained by fermentation are described 
in British Patent Specification 1573955. The milbemycins 
are structurally related macrolide antibiotics lacking 
the sugar residues at the 13-position. They may be 
produced by fermentation, for example as described in 
British Patent Specification No 1390336 and European 
Patent Specification No. 0170006. In addition to these fermentation-derived products, 
a large number of publications describe compounds derived 
semisynthetically from these products, many of which 
possess useful antiparasitic properties. Some of this 
chemistry is reviewed in Macrolide Antibiotics, Omura S., 
Ed., Academic Press, New York (1984) and by Davies, H.G. 
and Green, R.H. in Natural Product Reports (1986), 3, 
87-121 and in Chem. Soc. Rev. (1991), 20, 211-269 and 
271-239. Compounds related to the original C-076 avermectins 
have also been prepared by fermentation of avermectin-producing 
micro-organisms. For example European Patent 
Specifications 0214731 and 0317148 describe production of 
compounds related to the C-076 avermectins but having a 
different substituent at the 25-position by fermentation 
in the presence, in the fermentation medium, of certain 
acids.  
 Other publications mentioning different combinations 
of substituents at various positions on the avermectin or 
milbemycin nucleus are EP-A-317148, 340932, 335541, 
350187, 410615, 259779 and 254583; DE-A-2329486 and 
GB-A-2166436. The avermectins and milbemycins and their 
derivatives include compounds having the structure: 
 
wherein the broken line represents an optional bond, R1 
and R4 being absent when this bond is present, R1, R3, R4 
and R12 are independently H, OH, halo, oxo, oximino or an 
organic radical, R2 and R7 are organic radicals, R6 is H or 
an organic radical.  
 These compounds include the avermectins themselves 
and their substituted derivatives in which R3 is a 4'-(α-L-oleandrosyl)-α-L-oleandrosyloxy 
group, optionally 
substituted at the 4" position; the avermectin 
monosaccharides and their
