<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a adhesive tape and
a liquid adhesive for electronic parts to be used for adhering
between parts around leadframes making up a semiconductor
device, e.g., lead pins, semiconductor chip mounted
substrates, radiation plates, semiconductors themselves.Conventionally, adhesive tapes for fixing a
leadframe, TAB tapes, etc., are used as adhesive tapes for
use in the interior of resin-molded type semiconductor
devices. For example, the adhesive tapes for fixing a
leadframe have been used to fix lead pins of the leadframe in
order to enhance the efficiency for producing the leadframe
itself and the whole semiconductor assembly stages. In
general, a leadframe manufacturer tapes a leadframe, and
brings it to a semiconductor manufacturer, at which a chip
is mounted thereon followed by sealing the leadframe with a
resin. For this reason, it has been required for the adhesive
tapes for fixing the leadframe not only to possess general
reliability in a level required for semiconductor and enough
processability at the time of taping, but also to possess
sufficient adhesive strength immediately after taping and heat
resistance enough for withstanding thermal process at the
stages of assembling semiconductor devices.Conventionally, the adhesive tapes for use in such an
application include adhesive tapes applying on a support film 
of a polyimide film, etc., an adhesive comprising a synthetic
rubber resin such as polyacrylonitrile, polyacrylate or
acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer solely, or modified with
any other resin or blended with any other resin to come
into a B-stage.In recent years, resin-molded type semiconductor
devices as shown in Figs. 1 to 3 have been developed or
produced. In Fig. 1, the device has a construction in which
lead pins 3 and plane 2 are connected by means of an adhesive
layer 6, a semiconductor chip 1 is mounted on the plane 2, and
together with bonding wires 4 between the semiconductor chip
1 and the lead pins 3, they are molded with a resin 5. In
Fig. 2, the device has a construction in which the lead pins
3 on the leadframe are molded with the semiconductor chip 1 and
an adhesive layer 6 and together with a bonding wire 4, they
are molded with a resin 5. In Fig. 3, the device has a
construction in which a semiconductor chip 1 is mounted on a
die pad, electrode 8 is fixed with an adhesive layer 6, the
spaces between semiconductor chip 1 and an electrode 8 and
between the electrode 8 and lead pins 3 are each connected
with bonding wires 4, and they are molded
