<ABSTRACT>
In an electrochemical cell constituted by lamination of positive and negative electrodes, of a solid polymer electrolyte as well as of a metallic collector, in which the various layers are offset with respect to one another in order to make it possible to collect the current laterally, a strip of insulating material is interposed so as to prevent the free edge of the collector, which faces the electrolyte layer and/or the negative electrode layer, from piercing the electrolyte layer and/or short-circuiting the two electrodes. The disclosure also describes the preparation of such an electrochemical cell.

polymer electrolyte and of a lithium negative electrode,

collector layer and the negative electrode being covered
