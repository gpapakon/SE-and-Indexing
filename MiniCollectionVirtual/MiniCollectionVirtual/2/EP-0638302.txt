<ABSTRACT>
A sanitary napkin (1) comprises a liquid-permeable 
topsheet (4), a liquid-impermeable backsheet (5) and an 

absorbent core (6) interposed between the topsheet (4) and 
the backsheet (5). The topsheet (4) and backsheet (5) extend 

outwardly from opposite side edges of the core (6) to form 
side flaps (10). A supplementary flap (12) comprising an 

elastic band-like sheet is attached in its stretched state 
to a top surface of each side flap (10) so as to fit tightly 

against a user's skin to prevent side leakage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sanitary napkin 
for treatment of menstruation. Conventionally known sanitary napkins are provided 
with pockets or side flaps in laterally opposite side 
portions thereof, and further with elastic members 
disposed on the side flaps in an effort to prevent side 
leakage of body exudates. In Japanese Utility Model Laid-open 
No. Hei 2-26937 which is one known example, elastic 
strands are fixed longitudinally of side flaps to position 
in opposite sides of a core so that a bank function is 
provided to prevent leakage to outside. A sanitary napkin is pressed against a local 
portion of a user in its use, generally assisted by tight 
shorts. This creates a problem in conventional napkins 
having elastic members on side flaps thereof in that those 
members are pushed deeply into a user's skin which can provide 
unexpected pain or discomfort to the user. The above known 
technique attempts to solve this problem by providing  
 
elasticity in a thickness direction of the strands. 
However, using this technique it is difficult to provide a 
complete solution because those strands project from a 
topsheet. In another known construction having side flaps 
which cover portions of a core, there is a problem that the 
mense absorbing rate is reduced in the covered portions. WO-A-93 12747 discloses a sanitary napkin having a 
liquid-permeable topsheet, a liquid-impermeable backsheet 
and an absorbent core disposed between the topsheet and 
backsheet, with the sheets extending outwardly from the core 
to form side flaps. Each side flap has an elastomeric 
laminated member folded so as to be secured to the inner and 
outer surfaces of the side flap and has an unsecured portion 
or barrier cuff which is allowed to stand-up away from the 
side flap. A spacing member is provided to ensure that the 
barrier cuff does not collapse. In an alternative 
embodiment, the flap may be folded back upon itself at each 
end of the sanitary napkin and secured with an end seal. The present invention is directed toward solving the 
above problems by providing a supplementary flap comprising 
an elastic band-like sheet on a top surface of each side 
flap which extends from a side edge of a core for contacting 
a user's skin. Accordingly, the invention consists in a sanitary 
napkin comprising: 
a liquid-permeable topsheet; a liquid-impermeable backsheet; an absorbent core having a pair of side edges, said  
 
core being interposed between said topsheet and said 
backsheet so that at least said

<CLAIMS>
A sanitary napkin comprising: 

a liquid-permeable topsheet (4); 
a liquid-impermeable backsheet (5); 
an absorbent core (6) having a pair of side edges, said 
core (6) being interposed between said topsheet (4) and said 

backsheet (5) so that at least said backsheet (5) extends 
outwardly from each side edge of said absorbent core (6) to 

form a side flap (10); 
an elastic supplementary flap (12) disposed on a top 
surface (10A) of each said side flap (10), said 

supplementary flap (12) extending longitudinally along said 
top surface (10A) and being stretched longitudinally of said 

napkin, said supplementary flap (12) being secured to said 
top surface (10A) such that a side edge thereof forms a free 

edge, characterised in that said supplementary flap (12) 
consists of a monolithic elastic sheet (12) outwardly bi-folded 

to form a top portion and a bottom portion, said 
bottom portion having a top surface and a bottom surface 

being secured to said top surface (10A) of the side flap 
(10) at said bottom surface thereof, said top portion being 

secured to said top surface of the bottom portion at 
opposite end portions of said top surface thereof. 
A sanitary napkin according to Claim 1, wherein the bi-folding 
of said elastic sheet (12) defines a V-shape cross 

section including an apex, the apex being disposed inwardly.  
 
A sanitary napkin according to Claim 2, wherein the 
apex is located adjacent the side edge of said absorbent 

core (6). 
A sanitary napkin according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein 
the width of said top portion is substantially the same as 

that of said bottom portion.
