<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rotary perfecting press for printing sheets with a reversing drum (5) between double-diameter impression cylinders (3, 4), in the case of which the sheet, gripped on its leading edge by grippers (8) of the impression cylinder (3), is gripped, upon transfer to the reversing drum (5), on its trailing edge by grippers (9) of said reversing drum. Arranged in the reversing drum (5) are suction nozzles (10) which suck the sheet (6), guided on the impression cylinder (3), against the reversing drum (5) in the vicinity of its trailing edge and thereby smooth it diagonally and peripherally on the circumference of the impression cylinder (3) before the grippers (9), gripping the sheet on its trailing edge, of the reversing drum (5) close and the grippers (8), retaining the sheet (6) on its leading edge, of the impression cylinder open.

Rotary sheet-fed printing machine for perfecting 
purposes, having a turning drum (5) between double-diameter 

impression cylinders (3, 4) of two successive 

printing units, in the case of which the sheet, which is 
seized at its leading edge by grippers of the impression 

cylinder (3) which is at the front in the sheet-running 
direction, is seized at its trailing edge, upon its 

transfer to the likewise double-sized turning drum (5), 
by grippers (9) of the turning drum (5) before the 

grippers (8) of the impression cylinder (3) which retain 
the sheet at its leading edge open, and in the case of 

which suction nozzles (10) are arranged in the turning 
drum (5), characterized in that the suction nozzles (10) 

are designed to be diagonally and peripherally movable 
and suck the sheet (6), which is guided on the impression 

cylinder (3) which is at the front in the sheet-running 
direction, in the vicinity of its trailing edge against 

the circumference of the turning drum (5) and thereby 
smooth said sheet diagonally and peripherally on the 

circumference of the impression cylinder before the 
grippers (9), which seize the sheet (6) at its trailing 

edge, of the turning drum (5) close and the grippers (8), 
which retain the sheet at its leading edge, of the 

impression cylinder (3) open. 
Rotary sheet-fed printing machine according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that rotary suckers (10) having 

a suction opening (13) located asymmetrically with 
respect to the axis of rotation are arranged in the rear 

of the region where the sheet (6) rests on a double-diameter  
 

impression cylinder (3) in the turning drum (5). 
Rotary sheet-fed printing machine according to 
Claim 2, characterized in that a plurality of rotary 

suckers (10) are arranged, transversely with respect to 
the machine longitudinal centre, at a distance one beside 

the other and an angle of rotation which increases 
outwards from the machine longitudinal centre.
