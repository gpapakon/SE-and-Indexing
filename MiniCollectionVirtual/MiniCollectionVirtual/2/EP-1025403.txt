<ABSTRACT>
A control for a refrigeration system serviced by a special pulse width modulated compressor (30) coupled to a condenser (32) and evaporator (42). The system can be of the distributed type wherein the condenser (32) and compressor (30) may be coupled to service a group of adjacent refrigeration cases, wherein each case would have its own evaporator (42). A controller (52) is coupled to a load sensor (58) for producing a variable duty cycle control signal (54) in which the duty cycle is a function of demand for cooling. Moreover, fuzzy logic technique may be utilized in order to provide self adaptive tuning control for the system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to refrigeration systems, compressor control systems and refrigerant regulating valve control systems. More particularly, the invention relates to an adaptive self-tuning controller for a refrigerant pressure effecting component of a refrigeration system, which pressure effecting component may be a compressor. The compressor may have two mechanical elements separated by a seal, and these mechanical elements are cyclically movable relative to one another to develop fluid pressure. The compressor may also include a mechanism to selectively break the seal in response to the control signal, thereby modulating the capacity of the system.The refrigeration system can be deployed as a distributed system in refrigeration cases and the like. The preferred arrangement allows the compressor and condenser subsystems to be disposed in or mounted on the refrigeration case, thereby greatly reducing the length of refrigerant conduit and refrigerant required.Conventionally, refrigeration systems for supermarket refrigeration cases have employed air-cooled or water-cooled condensers fed by a rack of compressors. The compressors are coupled in parallel so that they may be switched on and off in stages to adjust the system cooling capacity to the demands of the load. Commonly, the condensers are located outside, on the roof, or in a machine room adjacent the shopping area where the refrigeration cases are located.Within each refrigeration case is an evaporator fed by lines from the condensers through which the expanded refrigerant circulates to cool the case. Conventionally, a closed-loop control system regulates refrigerant flow through the evaporator to maintain the desired case temperature. Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) closed loop control systems are popular for this purpose, with temperature sensors and/or pressure sensors providing the sensed condition inputs.It is common practice within supermarkets to use separate systems to supply different individual cooling temperature ranges: low temperature (for frozen foods, ice cream, nominally -32°C (-25°F); medium (for meat, dairy products, nominally -7°C (+20°F); high (for floral, produce, nominally 2° to 4°C (+35 to +40°F)). The separate low, medium and high temperature systems are each optimized to their respective temperature ranges. Normally, each will employ its own rack of compressors and its own set of refrigerant conduits to and from the compressors and condensers.The conventional arrangement, described above, is

An adaptive self-tuning controller (52) for a refrigerant pressure effecting component of a refrigeration system, comprising:

a control processor (102) coupled to said pressure effecting component for providing closed loop control over said component based on an error signal (264);
said control processor (102) including memory (278) for storing first processing instructions for performing a control algorithm that includes at least one programmably adjustable gain factor;
said control processor (102) including memory (274) for storing second processing instructions for adaptively changing said programmably adjustable gain factor by periodically generating a new gain factor (276);
said second processing instructions causing said control processor to:

(a) monitor fluctuation in said error signal (264) and generate a numeric value (272) indicative of the percent fluctuation in said error signal over a predetermined time;
(b)fuzzify said numeric value (272) by applying a membershipfunction (300) to generate a set of fuzzy input values indicative of degree of membership;
(c) apply a predetermined set of rules upon said fuzzy input values to generate a set of fuzzy output values, the predetermined set of rules reflecting the degree to which the gain factor associated with a given member of said membership function is to be changed; and
