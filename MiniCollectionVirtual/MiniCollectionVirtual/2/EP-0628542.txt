<ABSTRACT>
A process has been found for the preparation of organic carbamates from a basic amine, carbon dioxide and an alkylating agent, the process being characterised in that the amine is first reacted with carbon dioxide in the presence of one or more basic compounds of the elements lithium, sodium, magnesium, potassium, rubidium, strontium, caesium, barium and/or ammonium, and subsequently adding the alkylating agent.
