<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein is an acceleration sensor (41) having a 
sensor body (42) obtained by forming first and second signal 

electrodes (45, 46) on outer major surfaces of first and second 
piezoelectric ceramic plates (43, 44) which are pasted to each 

other through an intermediate electrode (47). The sensor body 
(42) is formed to be mechanically supported in the form of a 

center beam, and has such first to third regions that stress is 
caused in different directions in adjacent ones of the regions 

upon action of acceleration, while the first and second 
piezoelectric ceramic plates (43, 44) are polarized in opposite 

directions in the second region, so that charges which are 
opposite in polarity to those generated in the second region are 

not drawn from the signal electrodes (45, 46) in the first and 
third regions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an acceleration sensor, 
and more particularly, it relates to an acceleration sensor 
which is formed by a bimorph piezoelectric element. In general, an acceleration sensor employing a bimorph 
piezoelectric element is known in the art. An example of such an 
acceleration sensor is now described with reference to Fig. 1. A sensor operating under the same principle is disclosed in DE-A-3 817 354. Referring to Fig. 1, this acceleration sensor 1 is provided with a sensor body 2, 
which is formed by a bimorph piezoelectric element. The sensor body 2 comprises strip-shaped first and second 
piezoelectric ceramic plates 3 and 4, which are laminated to each 
other. First and second signal electrodes 5 and 6 are formed on 
first major surfaces of the first and second piezoelectric 
ceramic plates 3 and 4 respectively. The first and second signal 
electrodes 5 and 6 are formed on the first major surfaces of the 
first and second piezoelectric ceramic plates to extend from one 
edge toward another edge, respectively, but not to reach the 
second edges. The first and second signal electrodes 5 and 6 are 
opposed to each other in central regions through the first and 
second piezoelectric ceramic plates 3 and 4.  
 An intermediate electrode 7 is arranged between the first 
and second piezoelectric ceramic plates 3 and 4. The 
intermediate electrode 7 is formed to be opposed to the first and 
second signal electrodes 5 and 6, in portions where the same are 
opposed to each other. The first and second piezoelectric ceramic plates 3 and 4 
are uniformly polarized along arrows X and Y in Fig. 1, 
respectively. In other words, the first and second 
piezoelectric ceramic plates 4 and 5 are polarized in directions 
X and Y which are opposite to each other. The sensor body 2 is held by first and second holding 
members 8 and 9 in portions which are close to both ends thereof. 
While Fig. 1 shows only the outline of the first holding member 8 
in phantom lines, the first and second holding members 8 and 9 
are fixed to the sensor body 2 on both ends thereof. The first 
and second holding members 8 and 9 are provided with cavities 8a 
and 9a between the portions which are fixed to the sensor body 2 
respectively, in order to define spaces for allowing 
displacement of the sensor body 2. The first and second holding members 8 and 9 form parts of a 
case holding the sensor body 2. In the structure shown in Fig. 
1, a first terminal electrode 10 is formed on an outer surface of 
this case, i.e.,
