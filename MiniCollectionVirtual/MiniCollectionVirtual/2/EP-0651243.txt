<ABSTRACT>
A method of and a device for making specimens for high-resolution 
electron microscopy (HREM). The known ion milling technique enables specimens to 

be made which are sufficiently thin so as to be electron-transparent, being a condition 
for HREM materials examinations. This known technique, however, has the drawback 

that amorphous material remains on the surface of the specimen after treatment. This 
may cause a blurring of the image of the surface and may also lead to incorrect 

materials analysis. In accordance with the invention, the surface of the specimen is 
exposed, possibly after ion milling, to ions extracted from a plasma generated in the 

vicinity of this surface. The formation of disturbing amorphous regions on the specimen 
surface is thus avoided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of making specimens for examination 
by means of a particle-optical apparatus. The invention also relates to a device for carrying out the method and to a 
particle-optical apparatus comprising such a device. Many materials of interest nowadays from a point of view of materials 
science have properties which are determined by their microstructure; examples in this 
respect are materials with crystallites of dimensions in the nanometer range, multilayer 
structures such as used for X-ray reflection, and microelectronic components. In order 
to understand their macroscopic properties, it is of essential importance to determine the 
structure properties at an atomic scale. However, examinations at a molecular scale are 
important not only for materials science but also for biological specimens. The properties at such a small scale can be determined by means of a 
particle-optical apparatus such as an electron microscope. Therefore, it is necessary to 
make specimens for examination in such apparatus in which the desired material 
properties can be determined. Such specimens should preferably be so thin that they are 
transparent to electrons of an energy which is customary in electron microscopes. For electron microscopy there are a number of methods of making 
electron-transparent specimens which are known, for example as pulverizing, 
ultramicrotomy, chemical polishing and ion milling. Each of these methods, however, 
has its own drawbacks which make the relevant method unattractive or even completely 
unsuitable for making specimens for the purpose of materials examination at an atomic 
scale. Upon pulverization of multi-component systems (such as, for example an 
integrated semiconductor in which metal connections are attached to semiconductor 
material), the boundaries between the components are usually lost. Particularly these 
boundaries are of interest to materials science, so that specimens made according to this  
 
method can be used to a limited extent only. Ultramicrotomy is a method of making 
slices of specimens with a thickness of more than 5 nm. This method, however, cannot 
be used very well in the case of hard materials because the large forces occurring 
during cutting cause many faults (such as dislocations and fractures) in the material to 
be studied, so that an incorrect impression of the structure of the material is obtained. 
For chemical polishing a liquid with a solvent is conducted across the specimen material 
(for example, acid across metal).
