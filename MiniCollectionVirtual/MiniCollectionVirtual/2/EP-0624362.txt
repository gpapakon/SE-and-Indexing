<ABSTRACT>
A multistage method for the dyeing of human hair which, in particular, improves the covering power and is mild on the hair and, furthermore, permits the production of numerous shades of colour using a small number of dye compositions, consists of the following steps:   a) application of an alkaline oxidation dye mixture which contains at least one developer and at least one coupler substance as well as an oxidising agent, predominantly to the portion of the human hair which is adjacent to the scalp, the mixture being adjusted to the shade required for the complete dyeing;   b) rinsing and shampooing the hair after the dye has acted; c) application of an acidic oxidation dye mixture which contains at least one developer and at least one coupler substance as well as an oxidising agent to all the hair, and d) rinsing the hair after the dye has acted.

Process for oxidative dyeing and re-dyeing of human hair, 
characterized by the combination of the following sequential 

steps: 

a) Application of an alkaline oxidation hair dye composition 
comprising at least one developing and at least one 

coupling substance as well as an oxidizing agent, mainly to 
the hair region next to the scalp, whereby the composition 

is adjusted to the hair shade desired for the total hair 
dyeing result; 
b) rinsing and shampooing of the hair after completed 
processing of the dyeing composition; 
c) application of an acidic oxidation hair dye composition 
comprising at least one developing substance and at least 

one coupling substance as well as an oxidizing agent, to 
the total hair; and 
d) rinsing of the hair after complete processing of the hair 
dye. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the processing 
time of the dyeing substance of the second step of the 

dyeing procedure is shorter than that of the first step. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
processing action of the hair dye is performed at about 30 to 

50Â°C. 
Process according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the oxidation hair dye composition used in the 

first step is already adjusted to the shade to be realized 
after the completion of the total hair dyeing procedure by 

admixture of two standard hair dye compositions.
