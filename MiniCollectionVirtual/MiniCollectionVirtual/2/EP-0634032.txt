<ABSTRACT>
The process control display program receives input in the form of an alphanumeric process control statement (136, 138). The alphanumeric statement is parsed into its constituent lexical units and graphical icons (160-170) corresponding to those lexical units are arranged on the display screen (116) in an interconnected network or pattern which corresponds to the syntactic relationship of the lexical units which make up the statement being displayed. The change or flow of live data is depicted by changing the visual quality or color (160, 162) of the icons and their interconnecting network to provide a graphical representation of the alphanumeric statement which is readily understood by users worldwide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to process control computer systems 
and particularly to a system and method for graphically displaying the flow of process control 
information in a way is readily understood by users worldwide. In recent years, computers have been increasingly employed to automate and 
control the production of chemicals, plastics and other industrial resources. In this regard, 
it should be appreciated that each process will typically present a unique set of operational 
constraints, input parameters and output devices to be controlled. Thus, the design of 
process control systems tends to be driven by the specific considerations of the process at 
hand. Accordingly, the interaction between the process control equipment and the 
technicians responsible for running the process will generally be quite different from one 
process to another. Additionally, it should be appreciated that computertechnology has developed 
and continues to develop at a rapid pace. Thus, it is possible that a variety of different 
computer hardware platforms and software packages may be employed for process control 
systems at one or more sites, even when the processes involved were the similar or the same. 
Accordingly, the way in which a technician interacts with the process control equipment will 
depend not only upon the process itself, but the generation and type of equipment being 
employed to control the process. In this regard, substantial time and effort may be devoted 
to developing the software for displaying the complex information being gathered and 
manipulated by any particular computer-based control system, and there may be little if any 
consistency in how this information is communicated from one control system to the next. 
This results in a loss of productivity due the time invested by system designers and the time 
required to train the personnel who are ultimately charged with the responsibility to run and 
maintain the equipment used to control the process. PROCEEDINGS COMPEURO 91, 5TH ANNUAL EUROPEAN COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY,

A method of process control for producing a graphical display 
representation of a physical process on a display device (114) of a computer system of the 

type capable of producing a graphical display window (116), the physical process (102) 
being of the type capable of being represented by alphanumeric process control statements 

(136,138) in which the process control statements comprise a set of lexical units grouped in 
a syntactic relationship defined by a predetermined grammar with at least a subset of the 

lexical units being capable of representing data, the method comprising the steps of:
 
   supplying a process control statement to be displayed (300-314) by at least one 

process control computer means (104,106); generating a parse tree (318) corresponding to 
the process control statement to be displayed by a computer implemented (112) statement 

analyzer means (316) adapted to communicate with said process control computer means; 
establishing a predefined set of graphical icons (160-170) for representing at least a portion 

of said lexical units in a preprogrammed memory means; wherein a display generation means 
(326,328) communicates with and receives said parse tree from said statement analyzer 

means and operates to place selected ones of said predefined set of graphical icons in said 
display window in a spatial relationship corresponding to the syntactic relationship of said 

lexical units which make up said process control statement to be displayed; supplying data 
(130) corresponding to at least one of said lexical units of said process control statement to 

be displayed by the process control computer means; establishing the visual quality of said 
selected graphical icons in said display window based on said supplied data by a computer 

implemented evaluation means responsive to the syntactic relationship defined by said 
process control statement to be displayed, whereby at least a first process control condition 

may be visually distinguished from a second process control condition on the basis of the 
visual quality of the icons displayed. 
The method according to Claim 1 wherein said display generation 
means operates in an interconnected network and places selected ones of said predefined set of graphical icons in said display window. 
The method according to Claim 1 or 2 wherein said supplied data is 
dynamically changing data. 
The method according to any of Claims 1 to 3 wherein said visual 
quality is color.  

 
The method according to any of Claims 1 to 4 wherein said visual 
quality is color, in which a first color is used to represent a first condition and a second color 

is used to represent a second condition.
