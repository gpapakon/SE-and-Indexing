<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method, which is simple to execute, for monitoring the operation of mechanical paper shredders. The current coasting behaviour of the blade rollers is determined and compared with the coasting behaviour of correctly operating blade rollers. Deviations in the coasting behaviour indicate impairment of the operation of the blade rollers currently in use. Depending on the degree of deviation, measures are initiated which eliminate the operational impairment.

<CLAIMS>
A method for functional monitoring of mechanical paper 
shredders wherein the sheet material to be destroyed is guided 

between rotating and meshing cutter blocks, characterized in 
that the slow-down behavior of well-functioning cutter blocks 

is determined and compared with the currently determined behavior 

of cutter blocks to be checked, any deviations are 
evaluated with reference to given ranges of tolerance, and 

suitable measures taken in accordance therewith. 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that the functional 
test is repeated regularly.
