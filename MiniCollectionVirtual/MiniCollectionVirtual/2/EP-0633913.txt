where 


R

 =
straight-chain or branched alkyl radical having 10 
carbon atoms, 
R
2
 =
straight-chain alkyl radical having 4 carbon 
atoms, 
R
3
 =
straight-chain or branched alkyl radical having 20 
carbon atoms, 
 
and where the indices given for the ethylene oxide 

units represent decimal values,
 
individually or in mixture as a sedimenting additive 

for coagulants for lacquers, waxes and other coating 
agents in circuit waters for lacquer spraying booths, 

the alkyl polyethylene glycol ethers being used in 
quantities of from 1 to 10 wt.%, based on the total 

composition of the coagulants. 
The use according to claim 1, characterised in that 

R
1
 stands for a straight-chain alkyl radical 
having 10 carbon atoms, and 
R
2
 stands for a branched alkyl radical having 20 carbon 
atoms, preferably a 2-octyl dodecyl radical. 
The use according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the alkyl polyethylene glycol ethers are used in 

quantities of from 3 to 7 wt.%, based on the total 
composition of the coagulants used. 
The use according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the alkyl polyethylene glycol  

 
ethers are added to the circuit waters either together 

with or separately from the coagulants. 
The use according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that a mixture of the alkyl 

polyethylene glycol ethers corresponding to the 
general formulae (I) and (II) is used, the mixing 

ratio being in the region of from 10:1 to 1:10, 
particularly 1:1.
