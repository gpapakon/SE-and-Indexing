<ABSTRACT>
Pixels, which include both thin-film type transistors (1) and liquid crystal cells 
(3) driven by liquid crystal driving electrodes, are arranged in a matrix shape together 

with image signal lines (4) and control signal lines (5) connected to each of the 
transistors. A control signal line driving circuit (6) is formed of shift registers having 

one bit per signal line, and data signals inputted on scanning-start, synchronised with the 
clock signal. The driving circuit outputs the signals capable of turning-ON the thin-film 

transistor of the corresponding control signal line from a shift register on a position 
which is moved by one bit per every clock cycle. A detecting circuit (9) of the image 

signal line driving circuit (8) have three terminals, the first terminals are connected to the 
image signal lines (4), the second terminals are connected to output lines (10), and the 

third terminals are connected to outputs (11) of the shift registers, so that failures of the 
driving circuits can be detected simply.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to inspection circuits of flat type light valve devices
used for direct visual type display devices or projection type display devices. More
specifically, it relates to light valve devices, for example, inspection circuits of active-matrix
liquid crystal display devices, which incorporate integrated circuits as a liquid
crystal panel formed of driving circuits unitarily into semiconductor thin films.An active-matrix type liquid crystal display device operates by using an extremely
simplified principle. Switching elements are provided on each pixel. When selecting a
specified pixel the corresponding switching elements are conducted, and when non-selecting,
the switching elements are put into a non-conductive state. The switching
elements are formed on a glass substrate constituting a liquid crystal panel. It is
therefore important to realise the technique for more satisfactorily producing thin-film
shaped switching elements. For such elements, thin-film type transistors are generally
used.The conventional active-matrix device, as is shown in a schematic circuit diagram
in figure 6, comprises; pixels each arranged in a matrix shape in vertical and horizontal
directions which are formed of thin-film transistors 1 and electro-optic
elements 3 such
as liquid crystal; control signal lines 5 provided on gate electrodes of the thin film
transistors 1; image signal lines 4 connected to source electrodes; an image signal line
driving circuit 8 connected to the image signal lines 4; and an image signal line driving
circuit 6 connected to control signal lines 5. The control signal line driving circuit 6 is
mainly formed of shift registers, where each unit-bit output is connected to the signal
lines 5. The image signal line driving circuit 8 is formed of shift registers and sample
hold circuits provided at every bit basis, and writes the image signals into the sample
hold circuits in accordance with sampling signals from the output of the shift registers. The conventional light valve device has more than several hundreds pixels
respectively for vertical and horizontal directions. The entire pixels thus reach the
number of one million and generally over at least an area of more than 1 cm2. It is
considerably difficult to produce such elements with a high production yield without any
defects. In general the produced elements are inspected in a form of the driving
substrate before completion as a light valve device. The most normal method of
inspection, to determine acceptability or
