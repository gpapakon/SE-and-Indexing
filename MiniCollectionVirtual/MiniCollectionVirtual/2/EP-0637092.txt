negative electrode (24) and one positive electrode (22) 

of two different cells (20) are formed by the use of the 
same grid (36), different portions (38a, 38b) of which

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical battery 
comprising a container which contains at least two cells 
disposed electrically in series and each including two 
electrodes, a positive one and a negative one, 
separated by a partition, each electrode being 
constituted by at least one grid of electrically 
conductive material adapted to support a positive or 
negative active paste. In known batteries of the type mentioned above, the 
electrical connection of several cells in series is 
achieved by means of welded bridges of conductive 
material which connect together the electrodes of 
opposite polarity in adjacent cells. This type of connection may be broken in various ways: 
for example, improper welding or corrosion thereof due to 
the generation of localised cells. Such breaks in the electrical connections cause the 
battery to stop operating, and in some circumstances, 
more serious consequences such as its discharge. In order to avoid these problems, 
in known batteries of the type indicated 
above at least one negative  
 
electrode and one positive electrode of two different 
cells are formed with the use of the same grid, different 
portions of which support the positive active paste and 
the negative active paste respectively. Batteries of this latter kind are known from WO-A-89 12 329 and EP-A-0 107 976. The subject of the present invention is constituted by a battery having the features disclosed in claim 1, whereby the manufacture of grids is simplified. In the batteries of the invention, the electrical connection 
between electrodes of opposite polarity in adjacent cells 
is achieved by virtue of the said grid of conductive 
material, different portions of which act as the negative 
electrode and the positive electrode respectively. This electrical connection is thus intrinsically secure 
and may be considered in practice free from interruption 
during the working life of the battery. The battery according to the invention has the further 
advantage of having a compact structure which does not 
require additional elements to ensure the interconnection 
of the various cells, with a simplification in the 
process for its production. In one embodiment, which provides for the formation of 
the smallest configuration possible for the battery of 
the invention, this latter comprises first and second 
adjacent cells. The first and second cells include a 
first positive electrode and a first negative electrode 
respectively having terminals for connection to external 
circuits. A grid,
