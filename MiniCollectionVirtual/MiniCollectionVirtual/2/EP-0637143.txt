<ABSTRACT>
A base station of a CDMA communication system includes a 
transmission de-correlator (12) for eliminating interferences between 

communication channels of a downlink. The transmission de-correlator (12) 
has a memory storing a set of data representative of the 

products of transmission information bits for the respective 
channels, and the sums of the products of the spread code data 

sequences for the respective channels, and the elements of an 
inverse matrix with respect to a predetermined matrix of a cross-correlation 

between the spread code data sequences for the 
respective channels. The sums correspond to additions of the 

products along one of a direction of columns or to additions of the 
products along one of a direction of rows of the inverse matrix. A 

counting device (14) is operative for causing the memory to sequentially 
output the data therefrom. An adder (13) serves to calculate a sum of the 

data outputted from the memory.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a CDMA (code division multiple
access) communication apparatus usable in a communication system
such as a mobile communication system or a wire communication
system.In a typical CDMA communication system, a base station can
communicate with mobile stations to which different pseudo-noise
codes (spread codes) are assigned respectively. In the base station,
base-band information pieces to be transmitted to the mobile
stations are modulated in response to the pseudo-noise codes
respectively before being combined and multiplexed into a
composite information signal. Then, a carrier is modulated in
response to the composite information signal. The base station
transmits the resultant modulated carrier toward the mobile
stations via a downlink. Each of the mobile stations receives the
modulated carrier. At each of the mobile stations, the composite
information signal is recovered from the received carrier, and then
the composite information signal is demodulated into the related
base-band information piece in response to the assigned pseudo-noise
code.Generally, the base station is provided with a transmission de-correlator
for processing pseudo-noise coded information to 
prevent or eliminate interferences between communication
channels in the downlink. As will be described later, a prior-art
transmission de-correlator tends to be complicated in structure.It is an object of this invention to provide an improved CDMA
(code division multiple access) communication apparatus.This object is solved by the following three embodiments of the invention.In a base station of a CDMA communication system, a
transmission de-correlator for eliminating interferences between
communication channels of a downlink according to a first aspect of
this invention comprises a memory storing a set of data
representative of the products of transmission information bits for
the respective channels, and the sums of the products of the spread
code data sequences for the respective channels, and the elements
of an inverse matrix with respect to a predetermined matrix of a
cross-correlation between the spread code data sequences for the
respective channels, wherein said sums correspond to additions of
the products along one of a direction of columns or to additions of
the products along one one of a direction of rows of the inverse
matrix; a counting means for causing the memory to sequentially
output the data therefrom; and an adder for calculating a sum of the
data outputted from the memory.In a base station of a
