<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an aligning means for plates to be welded. The aligning means (1) for aligning the surfaces of two plates (6a, 6b) to be welded comprises a shaft portion (2), a support member (3) with its extension bent into a pointed end support (4), and an abutment (5) on the side opposite to the pointed end support. When the aligning means (1) is inserted into a gap (7) between the plates (6a, 6b), the lower plate can be lifted by the pointed end support (4), and the upper plate can be pressed downward by the abutment (5), whereafter the plates can be welded together and the aligning means (1) can be displaced to another position in the gap (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a means for aligning
the edges of plate-like bodies for welding said edges
together, comprising a plate-like support member to be
inserted into a gap between the edges to be welded,
and support means positioned on the opposite sides of
the plates and arranged to press the edges of the
bodies to be welded into the same plane.When metal plates are welded together so that
the weld joint or seam will be long, there occurs
problems in the alignment and welding of the plates if
the plates are not straight and their bending and edge
shapes differ from each other. The same problems occur
when cylindrical or curved surfaces are welded together.
Plate edges to be welded together are thereby
very often in different planes, which causes welding
problems. Plates edges are conventionally forced into
the same plane by hammering or wedging. With greater
plate thicknesses, it is possible to weld a beam to
one plate so as to be able to lift or lower the edge
of the plate as required. With a cylindrical body, is
it also possible to support the edges to be welded
from the inside of the cylinder by wedging or by using
separate support beams. Problems occur especially when
a cylinder or a similar tubular product to be welded
is too small for the work to be done from the inside
it but all measures have to be performed from the
outside.US Patent 3,875,645 teaches a means for aligning
the edges of plates to be welded together into the
same plane for making a local weld joint. The aligning
means can be removed through the gap. However, the
aligning means is very complicated in structure and 
thus difficult to use. As it comprises a great number
of components and threaded parts of different types,
it is also very difficult and time-consuming to adjust
according to the thickness of the plates to be welded.
It is further to be noted that when one welds together
plates of unequal thickness, this aligning means does
not enable the plate surfaces to be aligned into the
same plane. In addition, a gap equal in width to the
aligning means has to be left between the plates; in
practise, the gap is very wide so that the aligning
means cannot be used for aligning the edge surfaces of
thin plates. A further drawback of this solution is
that the thickness of the shaft used with narrow
welding grooves is minimal, and so, in practice, its
strength is usually insufficient for supporting the
plates. Correspondingly, if the thickness of the shaft
is increased, the welding groove has to be very wide,
which is not possible

Means for aligning the edges of plate-like
bodies (6a, 6b) for welding said edges together,

comprising a plate-like support member (3) to be
inserted into a gap between the edges to be welded,

and support means (4, 5) positioned on the opposite
sides of the plates and arranged to press the edges of

the bodies to be welded into the same plane, 
characterized

in that the support member (3) is
provided on one side with an abutment (5) which is

transverse to the support member (3) and intended to
be positioned against the surface of the upper body on

the side of the abutment (5); that the support member
is further provided at one edge with a plate-like

pointed end support (4) positioned at a distance from
the abutment (5) and forming an angle with the support

member (3) on the side opposite to the abutment (5),
and turning means (2) for turning the aligning means

about an axis perpendicular to the joint to be welded, from a position
at which the support member

(3) is inserted into the gap between the bodies with
the pointed end support (4) ahead to

an upright position at which the abutment (5) bears
against the upper surface of the upper body on its side and

the pointed end support (4) presses the lower surface
of the other body towards the abutment (5) so that the

plates (6a, 6b) are displaced substantially into the

same plane.
Aligning means according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that the pointed end support (4)
and the support member (3) are formed by a single

integral plate-like body, and that the pointed end
support (4) has been bent into an angle with respect

to the support member (3) along a substantially curved 
line.
Aligning means according to claim 1 or 2,

characterized
 in that the abutment (5)
and the support member (3) are made of the same plate-like

material, the abutment (5) being formed by
bending a portion of the support member (3) to the

side opposite to the pointed end support (4).
Aligning means according to any of the
preceding claims, 
characterized
 in that
the pointed end support (4) comprises a plate-like

aligning abut (4b) formed by bending a plate-like
portion forming an extension of the pointed end

support (4) in a direction opposite to the bending
direction of the pointed end support (4) relative to

the support member (3) so as to form a transverse
support positioned substantially in the same plane as

a support point (4a) of the pointed end support (4)
and extending across a plane defined by the support

member (3) and arranged to make contact with the lower
surface of the plates (6) to be aligned.
Aligning means according to any of the
preceding claims, 
characterized
 in that
it comprises an abutment (5) positioned on both sides

of the support member (3) substantially at the same
point.
Aligning means according to any of the
preceding claims, 
characterized
 in that
the turning means is formed by a lever (2) attached to

the support member (3).
