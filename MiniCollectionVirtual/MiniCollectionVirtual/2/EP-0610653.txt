<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
thermosensitive recording material on which colored 
images are formed by heating. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a thermosensitive recording 
material having a high thermosensitivity and being 
capable of forming thereon colored images resistant to 
fading and thus exhibiting a high degree of persistency 
during extended storage thereof. The thermosensitive recording material of the 
present invention is capable of recording thereon colored 
images exhibiting an excellent resistance to moisture, 
heat, oily and fatty substances, and plasticizers, and 
thus has superior persistency when stored over a long 
period of time and therefore is useful as colored image-recording 
sheets, sheets for use in facsimiles, word 
processors, CRT image printers and cash dispensers, as 
passenger tickets, commuter passes, labels such as POS 
labels, cards such as prepaid cards, and as transit 
passes. It is known that a conventional thermosensitive 
recording material comprises a supporting substrate, for 
example, a paper sheet, synthetic paper sheet, or plastic 
resin film and a thermosensitive colored image-forming 
layer formed on a surface of the supporting substrate and 
comprising a dye precursor, for example, an electron-donative 
leuco basic dye, a color-developing agent 
consisting of an electron-acceptive organic acid 
substance, for example, a phenolic compound, and a 
binder. When the thermosensitive colored image-forming 
layer is heated imagewise, colored images are recorded 
thereon by a reaction of the dye precursor with the  
 
color-developing agent. This type of thermosensitive recording material 
is disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent Publication 
(Kokoku) Nos. 43-4,160 and 45-14,039 and Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 48-27,736, and 
is widely employed in practice. Namely, the thermosensitive recording material 
is advantageous in that colored images can be easily 
formed by heating alone, and the recording apparatus can 
be made compact and small in size, has a relatively low 
price, and can be easily maintained. Therefore, the 
thermosensitive recording material is appreciated as a 
useful information-recording material for recording 
outputs of printers used with, for example, computers, 
facsimile machines, automatic ticket-vending machines, 
scientific measurement recorders, and CRT medical 
measurement recorders. Nevertheless, the conventional dye-forming type 
thermosensitive recording materials in which the
