<ABSTRACT>
A heating process for producing a high quality diamond or c-BN 
film on a diamond or c-BN substrate comprising placing a 

diamond or c-BN substrate in vacuum, elevating the temperature 
and treating its surface with a chlorine containing gas or a 

fluorine containing gas. The treatment gas is then removed and 
feed gases are introduced which are suitable for growing a 

thin diamond or c-BN film on the surface substrate under 
chemical vapor deposition conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
method of preparing improved diamond and c-BN 
films on a substrate. Semiconducting diamonds are drawing 
attention as new materials for use in 
semiconductor devices, including diodes, 
transistors and sensors. Diamonds are known 
widely today as good electrical insulators. 
However, the diamonds of interest in the present 
invention are semiconducting diamonds with low 
specific resistance. Diamond has a wide energy 
gap (5.5 eV) and a high carrier mobility (2,000 
cm²/V·sec) and is both thermally and chemically 
stable. Thus, semiconducting diamonds hold 
significant promise as excellent materials for use 
in environmentally resistant, high-speed or power 
devices and blue light emitting devices. Semiconducting diamonds are available in 
three/types, natural bulk, high-pressure 
synthesized bulk and vapor-phase synthesized thin 
film. Diamonds of p-type are obtained by doping 
the diamond film with boron (B). Diamonds of n-type 
are obtained by doping the diamond film with 
phosphorus (P) or lithium (Li). The n-type 
diamonds possess high resistance. Low-resistance 
n-type diamonds are not yet to be obtained. Bipolar devices cannot be fabricated 
from semiconducting diamonds. However, Schottky 
diodes which make use of a Schottky junction 
between tungsten (W) and a p-type diamond, as well 
as several types of unipolar transistors are 
currently being fabricated in the laboratory.  Methods which are commonly used to grow 
thin films of semiconducting diamonds include 
microwave plasma assisted CVD techniques and a hot 
filament assisted CVD techniques. In these 
methods, feed gases such as CH₄, CO and H₂ are 
decomposed using a microwave induced plasma or a 
hot filament. This results in the formation of 
thin diamond films on a heated substrate made of 
silicon (Si), molybdenum (Mo), diamond, etc. 
Addition of B₂H₆ to the feed gases allows thin 
films of p-type diamond can be obtained. Cubic boron nitride (c-BN) has also 
shown promise as a wide bandgap semiconductor. 
Specifically, c-BN is drawing attention as a 
material suitable for use in environmentally 
resistant devices, power devices and ultraviolet 
to blue light emitting devices. Like diamond, c-BN 
is also a material that has high chemical, 
thermal and physical stability. In addition, c-BN 
has a wide bandgap. Boron nitride (BN) is a compound made up 
of boron and nitrogen and is available in various 
structures including h-BN, t-BN and a-BN. 
Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is easy to prepare.
