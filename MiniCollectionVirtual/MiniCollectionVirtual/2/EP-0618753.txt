<ABSTRACT>
A low cost multipurpose electronic ballast for 
ultraviolet transilluminators and crosslinkers for starting 

and operating four or more ultraviolet lamps simultaneously. 

The electronic ballast is designed to be capable of operating 
with input voltages ranging from 85 volts AC to 250 volts AC 

and input frequencies ranging from 40 Hertz to 400 Hertz. The 
output to the lamps comes from a group of capacitors which 

control the current to the lamps. Because the output comes 
from capacitive ballasts in parallel, alternate sets of 

capacitors can be switched to alternate sets of lamps allowing 
the central ballast control to be used with different sets of 

lamps. By placing another set of capacitors in parallel with 
the existing output capacitors and making a momentary 

connection, a momentary power boost can be achieved. This 
feature also allows a variable intensity control comprised of 

a number of different size capacitors in series with the 
parallel group to vary the total current to all the lamps. 

Variable intensity can also be accomplished by reducing the 
input voltage with a variable resistor. These variable 

intensity controls can not reduce intensity to zero, but 
provide sufficient intensity variation range for the 

application. Changing the output capacitors provides the 
required current for different lamp wattages. This 

application is specifically designed for use with ultraviolet 
transilluminators and crosslinkers, allowing features not 

previously available. It is not beneficial for industrial 
lighting.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of 
ballast circuits for groups of ultraviolet lamps. The 
invention specified relates particularly to applications using 
four or more ultraviolet lamps and several unique application 
reatures it can provide in ultraviolet transilluminators and 
ultraviolet crosslinkers. Transilluminators and ultraviolet crosslinkers utilize 
ultraviolet lamps in their measurements of electrophoresis. 
Electrophoresis is an analytical tool that is used in the 
study of bacteria, viruses, and in protein differentiation, 
purification and nucleic acid studies. Electrophoresis 
involves the separation of charged molecules under the 
influence of an applied electric field. Visualization of electrophoresis with a transilluminator 
occurs by the optical absorption method or by the fluorescence 
method using an ultraviolet transilluminator. Alternatively, electrophoresis is also conducted with a 
crosslinker as follows: Nucleic acid transferred to a 
membrane is exposed to ultraviolet light which causes 
formation of a stable bond between bound molecules and the 
nylon membrane. All of the present commercial transilluminators and 
crosslinkers use fluorescent ultraviolet lamps that utilize 
electromagnetic ballasts. With these electromagnetic 
ballasts the tubes will flicker momentarily while they light.  
 
This flicker period will vary as some function of how long the 
unit has been on and the flicker period will vary with aging 
of the ultraviolet lamps. Such flicker is undesirable in the 
transillumiriator when visualization of a gel requires 
differentiation of shadings. The flicker is undesirable in the 
crosslinker where the calibration is determined by measuring 
the output intensity over a time period. Such flicker is 
undesirable in devices that must put out a measured repeatable 
pulse of ultraviolet illumination. Ultraviolet lamps used in these devices are basically 
fluorescent lamps that have a negative internal resistance 
characteristic once the gas in the lamp is ionized. This 
means that as current increases through the lamp, the 
resistance of the lamp decreases. This resistance decrease 
causes the current to further increase so that, unless some 
current-limiting ballast is provided, the lamp will be 
destroyed by excess current. Thus, a ballast system is required which will enable the 
lamp to operate at a sufficiently high current for proper 
illumination, but will prevent the current from increasing to 
a level at which the lamp will destroy itself.
