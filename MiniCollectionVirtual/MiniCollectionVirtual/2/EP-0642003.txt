<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combinational weighing
or counting method and a combinational weighing or counting apparatus which utilize a plurality
of weighing devices for weighing or counting a plurality of articles of
varying value such as, for example, snacks, candies, fruits, vegetables
or precise machine parts, and then to select an appropriate combination
of the articles based on results of weight measurements or counts.A combinational weighing apparatus is well known and is
disclosed in, for example, the Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication
No. 63-30725 published in 1988. The combinational weighing apparatus
is a machine utilizing a plurality of weighing hoppers operatively
coupled with a packaging machine so that bags each containing a
plurality of articles, such as, for example, snacks, candies, fruits or
vegetables, of varying value, can be averaged or substantially matched
in value to a target combined value by selecting a combination of
weighing hoppers accommodating the respective articles, the total
value of which would meet with the target combined value for the bag.Referring to Fig. 14, articles M to be weighed which have
been transported by means of a delivery conveyor 1 are dispensed
through a dispensing feeder 2 into a plurality of driving or article-conducting
feeders 31 to 3n which subsequently loads fractions of the
articles into respective weighing hoppers 61 to 6n. A combination control
means (not shown) selects some of the weighing hoppers 61 to 6n
to thereby select an appropriate combination of the weighing hoppers
61 to 6n. In other words, based on the values given by the respective
weighing hoppers 61 to 6n, the combination control means selects the 
appropriate combination of the weighing hoppers 61 to 6n which would
eventually provide a bag of the articles having a total value equal or
generally equal to a target combined value. The respective fractions
of the articles M accommodated within the weighing hoppers 61 to 6n
of the selected combination are discharged into a collecting chute 9 for
loading to a bag or any other receptacle.In order for the target combined value to be met by the
total value of the selected combination of the articles, that is, the total
value of the articles accommodated in the selected weighing hoppers
61 to 6n, as accurately as possible, and also in order to accomplish an
efficient selection of the appropriate combination, arrangement has
hitherto been made that the amount of the articles M to be supplied
into each of the weighing hoppers
