<ABSTRACT>
A modular tibial prosthesis contains a dovetail mechanism 
(4, 5 
&
 14) and a posterior tongue (15) and groove (8) 
arrangement. The dovetail mechanism cooperates with a 

reinforcing component (22) to allow alternate use of a spined 
component (20) with the same base plate (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a prosthetic device for replacing the proximal tibial surface of
a knee joint. More particularly it relates to a means for attaching the components of a modular
tibial prostheses to one another.Modular tibial prostheses having a base plate and a separate articular surface component
require a reliable means for attaching the articular surface component to the base plate. Ideally,
the attachment means will provide easy assembly and prevent both sliding and separation
between the plate and articular surface component. It is important that while achieving secure
fixation the attachment means does not incorporate features that unnecessarily weaken the plate
or articular surface component. For example these goals are particularly difficult to achieve in
constrained knee designs which can transmit significant tilting loads to the articular surface
component through a spine. FR-A-265 613 discloses a tibial base plate and separate articular
surface component attached by means of dovetail slots in the base extending around the periphery
of the base.The present invention addresses these requirements by providing in a modular tibial
prosthesis including a base plate and an articular component an interlocking two-segment
dovetail mechanism. The plate has an upwardly extending rail around its periphery which
merges with an upwardly extending two-segment dovetail. This continuous rail strengthens the
base plate by eliminating notches along the plate periphery. This configuration is accommodated
by the two-segment configuration which allows a continuous rail while maintaining dovetail
engagement posteriorly. The two-segment dovetail also minimizes the dimensions of the anterior
dovetail segment to reduce the requisite dovetail groove in the articular component thereby
yielding a stronger articular component. The dovetail segments incorporate compound angles
which engage a two-segment, compound angle, dovetail groove in the underside of the articular
component to wedge the articular component against the proximal surface and anterior rail of the
tibial plate. This wedging action resists sliding and separation between the tibial components. In a preferred embodiment, the dovetail mechanism
cooperates with a posterior tongue and groove arrangement to
further resist separation of the tibial components.The two-segment dovetail also allows the alternative use
of an articular component having a reinforced spine on the
same base plate design. A rigid reinforcing post extends
upwardly into the spine to

<CLAIMS>
An implant for the human knee comprising a tibial base plate (1) having dovetail
segments 
characterised in that
 the plate (1) further comprises

a generally planar top surface (2);
a first dovetail segment (4) extending upwardly from the top surface (2), the
segment (4) having converging sides, the converging sides forming a lead-in

angle; and
a second dovetail segment (5) extending upwardly from the top surface, the
second dovetail segment (5) having converging sides, the sides forming a lead-in

angle, the converging sides of the second segment (5) being offset outwardly with
respect to the converging sides of the first segment (4) such that the converging

sides of the first segment (4) are not collinear with the converging sides of the
second segment (5).
The implant of claim 1 further comprising a rail (3) extending above the top surface (2)
and extending substantially all the way around the top surface (2).
The implant of claim 2 wherein a portion of the rail (3) is undercut to form a tongue
receiving groove (8).
The implant of claim 3 further comprising a tibial articular surface (10) having:

an upper surface (11) for articulation with a femoral implant;
a lower surface (12) for engagement with the tibial base plate (1), the lower
surface (12) having an outer edge (13) shaped to fit within the rail (3), the lower
surface (12) further containing a dovetail groove (14) shaped to receive the first
and second dovetail segments (4, 5); and
a tongue (15) formed in a portion of the outer edge, the tongue (15) shaped to fit
within the tongue receiving groove (8).
