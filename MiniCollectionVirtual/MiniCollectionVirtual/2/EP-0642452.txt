<ABSTRACT>
A dispensing closure is provided with a body (24, 324, 524) having an outlet passage (40, 340, 540). A sleeve (80, 380, 580) is mounted on the body for rotation relative to the body. The sleeve has a transverse deck (102, 402, 602) defining a discharge passage (120, 420, 620) for communicating with the body outlet passage as the discharge passage moves in an arc relative to the body. In one embodiment, a seal (419, 437) is provided between the sleeve deck and the body around the outlet passage and discharge passage. In a preferred embodiment, an actuator (160, 460, 660) is mounted on the sleeve for rotation with the sleeve. Engaging structures (51, 52, 204, 208; 351, 352, 504, 508; 551, 552, 704, 708) are defined by the body and the actuator for tilting the actuator between a closed position and an open position while the actuator is rotated with the sleeve. The actuator includes engaging portions (204, 208; 504, 508; 704, 708) for engagement with drive members (51, 52; 351, 352; 551, 552) projecting upwardly from the body through openings (110, 112; 410, 412; 610, 612) in the sleeve. Engagement between the drive members and actuator is effected on opposite sides of the pivot axis of the actuator so as to effect tilting of the actuator between an open position and a closed position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to closures for
containers, and more particularly to a dispensing
closure which can be manipulated between a closed
orientation and an open, dispensing orientation.In accordance with the preamble of claim 1
GB-A-2 182 027 shows a dispensing closure including a closure
body and a cap or lid member. The body and cap are held in
relatively rotatable relationship to each other by an annular
bead formed on the underside of the cap member and a complementary
annular bead formed on the top wall on the closure
body. The interlocking action of the annular beads serves to
maintain the closure body and cap in axially fixed relationship
to each other and at the same time permits free rotation
of the cap relative to the body. The lid is provided with five
openings of different diameter. The closure is used by rotating
the cap member relative to the stationary closure body to
bring a selected one of the openings into alignment with the
opening on the closure body. Designs have been proposed for containers used
with flowable substances wherein a closure is provided
for being attached to the container mouth and wherein
the closure includes a toggle-action actuator, flip-up
spout, or nozzle assembly for dispensing the container
contents. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,058,775
4,962,869, 4,776,501, 4,645,086 and 3,516,581.The toggle-action closures, such as those
disclosed in the above-referenced U.S. Patent Nos.
5,058,775, 4,962,869, and 4,776,501, require that the
operator push down on a top, rear portion of the closure
in order to pivot the actuator portion of the closure to
the dispensing orientation.On the other hand, U.S. Patent No. 4,838,460
discloses a closure in which a tiltable actuator is
mounted within a rotatable collar, and rotation of the
collar operates through a cam ring to tilt the actuator
between the closed and open positions.While the above-discussed closures may
function generally satisfactorily for the purposes for
which they were designed, it would be desirable to
provide an improved dispensing closure with structural
and operational advantages.In particular, it would be advantageous to
provide a dispensing closure which operates by 
convenient means and does not require special operating
instructions. To this end, such an improved dispensing
closure should operate by means of a common manipulation
which is well known to consumers and which is generally
used by consumers to open containers.Preferably, operation of such an improved
closure should not require the
