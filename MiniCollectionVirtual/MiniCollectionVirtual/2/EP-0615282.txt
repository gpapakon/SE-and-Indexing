<ABSTRACT>
A method for making a grooved-gate metal oxide 
semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) with its 

drain separated from channel regions (DSC structure) is 
proposed for the purpose of meeting all the requirements 

of device reliability and performance that are 
introduced in the deep submicron technique. 
According to the present invention, channel regions (a) 
and field areas (c) are defined simultaneously and a MOSFET 

with concave-shaped channel regions (5) separated from a 
drain region (3) is formed by using LOCOS (10), such that surface 

damage produced by etching the silicon substrate may be 
prevented. The impurity for controlling a threshold 

voltage is implanted (5) all over the channel regions to 
prevent reduction of the mobility of carrier and 

transconductance that may be generated in the region 
where the channel regions (5) are separated from the drain 

region (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
making a metal oxide semiconductor field effect 
transistor. More particularly, it relates to a method 
for making a metal oxide semiconductor field effect 
transistor having a recessed gate structure that may 
reduce short-channel effects without trench-etching 
and/or etching processes. For past years, manufacturing techniques of metal 
oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) 
have been rapidly developed, reducing the minimum size 
of structural elements of integrated circuits by the 
ratio of about 10%. This trend is expected to continue 
in 1990's. Thus, the size of a MOSFET (gate length Lg or 
channel length) has been reduced to a deep submicron 
region (Lg<0.35µm) from a submicron region (Lg<1µm) for 
the increase of device performance and integrity. 
However, as the size of a MOSFET is reduced to the 
submicron region, it is difficult to suit best short-channel 
effects, hot carrier effects, and device 
characteristics altogether, according to the reduction 
of electric field. According to the scaling law, the speed of device  
 
performance has been improved but problems of device 
reliability are caused. The limit to the size of 
voltages placed is resulted not from short-channel 
effects such as simple punchthrough voltages but from 
the reduction of device reliability by the increase of 
energy carrier (or increase of temperatures, 
E = 3/2kT  
) 
due to the increase of electric fields inside the 
channel. From the late in the 1980's, the study on MOSFETs 
has been focused on the limit of device by scaling and 
the scaling limit by device reliability. Besides, there 
has been studied a structure that may moderate the 
scaling limit, by enhancing the device reliability. 
According to KITE REVIEW, Vol. 19 No. 5 pp 402 - 413, 
the device cannot be totally turned off at gate voltages 
Vg = OV  
 by short-channel effects. In such a technological background, there is a 
structure in which channel regions are not formed on the 
same plane as that of source/drain regions in order to 
overcome the limit of short-channel effects. EIJI TAKEDA 
et al referred to such a structure "MOSFET with Drain 
Separated from Channel Implanted Region (DSC)" in IEEE 
Ttans. Electron Devices, Vol. 30, No. 6, 1983. FIGS. 3A to 3G show the steps in the manufacture of 
MOSFET with DSC. First, a pad oxide layer 2 and a nitride layer 3 
are formed on a first conductivity type silicon  
 
substrate 1. The nitride layer 3 is patterned to define 
an active region
