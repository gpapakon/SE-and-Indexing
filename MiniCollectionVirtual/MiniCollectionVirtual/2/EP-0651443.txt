<ABSTRACT>
A transversal bipolar transistor is structured to have 
a single crystal semiconductor film provided on a single crystal 

semiconductor region which is provided on a semiconductor 
substrate. The semiconductor substrate is of a first 

conductivity type, and the single crystal semiconductor region 
is of a second conductivity type which is opposite to the first 

conductivity type. The single crystal semiconductor film is 
divided in the transversal direction into a central portion of 

the second conductivity type for a base region and left and right 
portions of the first conductivity type for emitter and collector 

regions. The transversal bipolar transistor may be integrated 
with a vertical bipolar transistor commonly on the semiconductor 

substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a semiconductor substrate, and 
more particularly to, the improvement on structure, operation 
speed and power consumption in a transversal bipolar transistor. A first conventional transversal bipolar transistor is 
described in the Japanese Patent Kokai No. 62-141760. In the 
first conventional transversal bipolar transistor, p-epitaxial 
regions are formed on an insulating substrate, and polysilicon 
layers are formed on silicon dioxide films formed to cross the 
central portions of the p-epitaxial regions. Impurities of n-conductivity 
type are injected into the p-epitaxial regions by 
using the polysilicon layers and silicon dioxide films as masks, 
so that a n-emitter region and a n-collector region are formed 
on the both sides of one of the p-epitaxial regions to provide 
the transversal bipolar transistor, and a n-source region and a 
n-drain region are formed on the both sides of the remaining one 
of the p-epitaxial region to provide the MOS transistor. A second conventional transversal bipolar transistor 
is described in the Japanese Patent Kokai No. 1-211969. In the 
second conventional transversal bipolar transistor, a n-impurity 
region is selectively formed on a semi-insulating semiconductor 
substrate, and a p-impurity region is formed in the central 
portion of the n-impurity region to provide a base region, so 
that the remaining portions of the n-impurity region are for  
 
emitter and collector regions. In the first conventional transversal bipolar 
transistor, however, there are disadvantages in that a width of 
the base region is difficult to be narrow, and high speed 
operation is hindered, because the width of the base region 
becomes large effectively in operation in which carriers emitted 
from the emitter region at the range of high current density 
propagate through the insulating substrate having a lower 
barrier, when a concentration of the base region is higher than 
that of the insulating substrate. In the second conventional transversal bipolar 
transistor, there is a disadvantage in that it is difficult to 
be fabricated simultaneously with the fabrication of a high 
performance vertical bipolar transistor. For instance, it is 
impossible to fabricate a semiconductor integrated circuit having 
a vertical NPN bipolar transistor and a transversal PNP bipolar 
transistor which operates with high speed and low power 
consumption under a small number of steps and a low cost. Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to 
provide a semiconductor
