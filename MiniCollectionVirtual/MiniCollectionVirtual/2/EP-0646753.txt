<ABSTRACT>
Heat-insulating inspection window or door for an appliance with an internal temperature differing from its ambient temperature, in particular for cooking or baking ovens or drying cupboards, having an arrangement, held by a common frame, of spaced-apart panes of glass, glass-ceramic or another transparent heat-resistant material, at least one further pane being arranged between the pane exposed to the ambient temperature and the pane exposed to the internal temperature of the appliance.

<CLAIMS>
Thermally insulating viewing window or door (1)
for an appliance having an internal temperature which

differs from its ambient temperature, in particular for
cooking ovens or drying cabinets, having an arrangement

of spaced panes of glass, glass-ceramic or another
transparent heat-resistant material which is held by a

common frame (4), where at least one further pane (6)
bonded at the edges to one of the outer panes by means of

spacers (5) which are adhesively bonded in a gas-tight
manner is arranged between the pane (2) which is exposed

to the ambient temperature and the pane (3) which is
exposed to the internal temperature of the appliance,
characterized in that

the spacers (5) are in the form of a compressible tube
(8) whose volume enables pressure equalization in the

case of temperature changes.
Thermally insulating viewing window according to
Claim 1,
characterized in that

the intermediate, further pane (6) is bonded at the edges
to the pane (2) exposed to the ambient temperature.
Thermally insulating viewing window according to
Claim 2,
characterized in that

the intermediate pane (6), the spacers (5) in the form of
a compressible tube (8) and the pane (2) which is exposed

to the ambient temperature are bonded by means of a heat-resistant
adhesive (7), in particular by means of a

silicone adhesive.
Thermally insulating viewing window according to 
one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that

the intermediate pane (6) is larger than the pane (3)
exposed to the internal temperature of the appliance.
Thermally insulating viewing window according to
one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that

at least one further pane (6) is arranged by means of
bonding between the intermediate, further pane (6) and

the pane (3) exposed to the internal temperature of the
appliance.
