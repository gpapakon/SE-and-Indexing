<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the preparation of ceramides by 
a two step process involving conversion of a 2-hydroximino-3-oxo-alkanoate 

into a 2-alkanoylamido-3-oxo-alkanoate 
intermedi
ate by acylation of the oxime and 
reduction of the oxime ester group to an amido group, 

followed by reduction of the keto and ester group of the 
intermediate to the 1,3 diol of the ceramide. The oxime 

acylation and the first reduction may be carried out 
consecutively or simultaneously. The first reduction is 

preferably a catalytic hydrogenation and the second 
reduction is preferably a borohydride reduction. 
The invention further relates to novel 2-alkanoylamido-3-oxo-alkanoates 
and 2-alkanoyloximino-3-oxo-alkanoates 

which are useful as intermediates for conversion into 
ceramides.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the preparation of ceramides 
starting from 3-oxo-alkanoates. More particularly the 
invention relates to the preparation of ceramides 
through conversion of 2-hydroximino-3-oxo-alkanoates 
into 2-alkanoylamido-3-oxo-alkanoates, followed by 
reduction to ceramides. The invention also relates to 
new 2-alkanoylamido-3-oxo-alkanoates and 
2-alkanoyloximino-3-oxo-alkanoates. Ceramides are known to be important constituents of the 
lipid fraction of the stratum corneum of the skin, in 
which they are believed to perform important functions, 
including protection of the skin from desiccation under 
the influence of adverse atmospheric conditions. 
Therefore, ceramides have been added to various cosmetic 
compositions aimed at improving or restoring the 
protective function of the skin. Such ceramides have 
been obtained primarily from various animal and to a 
lesser extent vegetable sources. A wealth of literature on the structure of ceramides 
exists, in which also their synthesis is described. 
Recently synthetic ceramides and ceramide analogues have 
been described in EP-A-0 097 059, EP-A-0 420 722 and 
EP-A-0 500 437. These ceramides and analogues have been 
synthesized from the corresponding sphingosines and 
dihydrosphingosines, hereinafter collectively referred 
to as "sphingosines". Thus, in the examples 1-4 of 
EP-A-0 500 437 various procedures to prepare 
2-linoleylamido-1,3-octadecanediol from 2-amino-1,3-octadecanediol 
have been described. The sphingosines in 
turn are conventionally obtained by sodium borohydride  
 
reduction of 2-acetamido-3-oxo-alkanoic acid esters, 
whereby the keto- and ester group are reduced to hydroxy 
groups and simultaneously the acetyl group is removed, 
see EP-A-0 500 437, example 1. Various routes for 
obtaining sphingosines are also described by D. Shapiro 
in "Chemistry of Sphingolipids", Hermann, Paris (1969). 
N. Singh et al, J. Carbohydrate Chem. 9(5) 543-559 
(1990) describes the synthesis of various sphingosine 
derivatives. 2-Hexadecanoylamino-3-oxo-octadecanoate is 
obtained as a byproduct. A route for obtaining 2-acetamido-3-oxo-alkanoates as 
precursors for sphingosines is described by G.I. Gregory 
and T. Malkin, J. Chem. Soc. [1951], 2453-2456, and 
involves oximation of methyl 3-oxo-alkanoate to the 2-hydroximino-3-oxo-alkanoates, 
followed by reductive 
acetylation of the oxime with zinc dust in a mixture of 
acetic acid and acetic anhydride. The synthesis of racemic ethyl 2-acetamido-3-oxo-butyrate,
