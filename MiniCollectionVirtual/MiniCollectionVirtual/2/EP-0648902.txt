<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a constructional element which is of variable design as far as its outer and/or inner dimensions are concerned and consists of a material comprising two or more components, in particular for building walls and floors, and a method for its manufacture. It is known to produce construction materials for as yet unwalls from wood concrete by casting and/or vibration. Dimensionally inaccurate, more or less deformed construction materials are produced, in particular, by shrinkage and deformation of the as yet unset filler. In accordance with the proposal of the invention, the disadvantages are eliminated in that the constructional element is made up of no-longer shrinking and dimensionally stable individual parts as sub-units; the individual parts themselves are severed from a larger unit, e.g. a slab produced in one manufacturing process, and connected in a positively locking and/or frictionally locking manner to produce the finished constructional element.
