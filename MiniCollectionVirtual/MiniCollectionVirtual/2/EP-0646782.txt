<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns load applying
devices in general and more particularly relates to
such a device for the purpose of determining the
deflection characteristics of a seatback portion of a
seat assembly.In order to design improved seat hardware
for automobiles, it is helpful to determine the
bending and torsional characteristics of the seatback
portion of a seat assembly. By so doing, one is able
to establish more readily seat deformation
characteristics and criteria which can improve
occupant retention on the seat and define
biomechanical responses when subjected to rear-end
impact loads. In addition, the bending and torsional
characteristics of a seatback portion could also
provide preliminary data for dynamic sled tests
investigating the characteristics of seats modified to
include energy absorbing or occupant retention
concepts.One type of seatback load applying device
used currently for determining the bending and
torsional stiffness of a seatback utilises a hydraulic
cylinder which applies a load through the upper cross
member of the seatback. In other words, the load is
applied only at a single point and at the highest
cross member of the seatback. One problem with this
form of load applying device is that it does not
provide a real world scenario in which the loading of
the seatback can occur initially at a lower portion of
the seatback and afterwards at higher levels as an
occupant moves in the seat.Accordingly, the object of the present
invention are to provide a seatback load applying
device which can be used for improving the design of a 
vehicle seat that may be subjected to rear loading.
The present invention may also provide a seatback load
applying device which provides data useful in the
design of seat hardware by having the occupant load
distributed over the entire seatback; a seatback load
applying device that simulates occupant loading into a
seatback in a quasi-static test procedure; and a load
applying device that is capable of applying
quasi-static and controlled loading along various
points of an automobile seatback starting at a
predetermined distance above the H-point of a seated
surrogate and ending at the upper cross member of the
seatback and head restraint.A seatback load applying device in
accordance with the present invention is characterised
by the features specified in Claim 1.The above objects and others are realised in
accordance with the present invention by providing a
load applying device which is adapted to apply a
horizontal load to a seat assembly positioned
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A seatback load applying device (10) for
determining the deflection characteristics of a seat

assembly (14) which includes a seatback portion (18)
and cushion portion (16) supported in a fixed position

and having a dummy (77) seated therein, said device
comprising a stanchion (22); a carriage (24) mounted

on the stanchion for movement along a horizontal axis
and a vertical axis; a longitudinally extendible force

applying member (28) having one end thereof mounted on
the carriage and the other end (78) thereof engageable

with the dummy; means (57) connected to the carriage
for counterbalancing the weight of the carriage and

the force applying means; and means (74,82-85,90,94)
operatively associated with the carriage, the force

applying member and the seat assembly for providing
output signals for determining the deflection of the

seatback portion in relation to the force applied to
the dummy.
A seatback load applying device as
claimed in Claim 1, wherein the force applying member

comprises a hydraulic cylinder (28) which is located
in a position so as to provide a horizontally directed

force to the dummy (77).
A seatback load applying device as
claimed in Claim 2, wherein the other end (78) of the

hydraulic cylinder (28) is formed so as to provide a
swivel-type connection with the dummy (77); and

wherein the means (57) connected to the carriage (24)
for counterbalancing the weight of the carriage and

the hydraulic cylinder allows the carriage to move
freely vertically upwardly and sideways to follow the

position of the dummy when the seatback portion (18)
is pivoted rearwardly during application of the

horizontally directed force to the dummy. 
A seatback load applying device as
claimed in Claim 3, wherein a rod end (72) of a piston

of the hydraulic cylinder (28) is formed with a
U-shaped slot to form a part of the swivel-type

connection.
A seatback load applying device as
claimed in Claim 4, wherein the dummy (77) is provided

with a lumbar spine portion (76) which is generally
round in cross section and to which the rod end (72)

of the piston is connected while the hydraulic
cylinder (28) applies the horizontally directed force

to the dummy.
A seatback load applying device as
claimed in Claim 4 or Claim 5, wherein the means

providing output signals comprises a string
potentiometer (74) mounted on the hydraulic cylinder

(28) for determining the position of the rod end (72)
of the piston relative to a cylinder member (70) of

the hydraulic cylinder.
A seatback load applying device as
claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 6, in which mounting

means are provided for mounting the carriage (24) on
the stanchion (22) for movement along a horizontal

axis and a vertical axis; wherein the mounting means
includes a first plate member (38) fixed to the

stanchion and supporting a pair of vertically spaced,
parallel, horizontally oriented guide rails (40,42); a

second plate member (44) mounted on the horizontally
oriented guide rails for horizontal movement

therealong; and a pair of laterally spaced vertically
oriented and parallel guide rails (46,48) supported on

the second plate member.
A seatback load applying device as
claimed in Claim 7, wherein stop means (66,68) are

provided on the first plate member (38) for limiting 
movement of the carriage (24) in a horizontal

direction.
A seatback load applying device as
claimed in Claim 7 or Claim 8, wherein stop means (64)

are provided below the vertically oriented guide rails
(46,48) for limiting downward movement of the carriage

(24).
A seatback load applying device as
claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 9, wherein the means

providing output signals comprises a pair of string
potentiometers (84,85) which are mounted on the

stanchion (22) and are connected to the carriage (24)
for determining the location of the force applying

member (28) in space.
