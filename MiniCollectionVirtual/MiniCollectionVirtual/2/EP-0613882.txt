<ABSTRACT>
5-Cyanovaleric acid esters (I) are prepared by carbonylating a 1-cyanobutene with carbon monoxide and with an alkanol (II) which corresponds to the ester radical, at elevated temperature and elevated pressure in the presence of a cobalt catalyst and in the presence of an activating solvent, using a carbonic acid diester, a carbamic acid ester or a urea of the general formulae IIIa, IIIb and IIIc R-O-CO-O-R     (IIIa

 or mixtures of these compounds (R identical or different, C1- to C6-alkyl groups, C5- to C7-cycloalkyl groups, or together 5- to 7-membered rings), in such amounts that they act as the activating solvent. The process products I are used as intermediates, mainly for the preparation of  epsilon -caprolactam.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing 5-cyanovaleric esters (I) 
by carbonylation of a 1-cyanobutene with carbon monoxide 

and an alkanol (II) corresponding to the ester radical at 
elevated temperature and elevated pressure in the 

presence of a cobalt catalyst and also in the presence of 
an activating solvent, characterized in that the 

activating solvent used comprises effective amounts of a 
carbonic diester, of a carbamic ester or of a urea of the 

general formulae IIIa, IIIb and IIIc

and these radicals can also be linked to one another to 

form 5- to 7-membered rings, or of mixtures of these 
compounds. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that a cyclic carbonic ester with 5- to 7-membered rings 

is used as activating solvent IIIa. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that activating solvent IIIb used is a cyclic carbamic 

ester having 5 to 7 ring members which carries a C

group on the nitrogen atom and can carry up to 2 

C

A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that activating solvent IIIc used is a urea whose 

radicals R can be identical or different and represent  
 

C

-alkyl groups, or in which two radicals R denote an 
ethylene or 1,2-propylene or 1,3-propylene group linking 

the two nitrogen atoms and the other radicals R are 
methyl or ethyl. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the starting concentration of activating 

solvents IIIa, IIIb and IIIc in the reaction mixture is 
from 35 to 65% by weight. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that methanol or ethanol is used as alkanol 

(II).
