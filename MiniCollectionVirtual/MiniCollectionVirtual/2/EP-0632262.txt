<ABSTRACT>
Method for measuring and evaluating analog photometric signals in an analysing system for test carriers and arrangement for carrying out the method. The test field of a test carrier is illuminated by a light source clocked in bright/dark phases. The re-emitted light is received and integrated by a measuring detector during a measuring period comprising a plurality of bright/dark phases. Effective suppression of stray and extraneous light, which allows measurement even without the hitherto customary shielding against ambient light, is achieved in that the sequence of bright and dark phases integrated during the measuring period is made non-uniform, so that the Fourier-transformed frequency spectrum involves a multiplicity of different frequencies. Each individual frequency therefore contributes to the measurement result only by a small fraction.
