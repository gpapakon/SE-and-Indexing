<ABSTRACT>
An improved self-capping disposable needle 
assembly for use in combination with a skin puncture 

apparatus is provided. More specifically, an improved 
self-capping disposable needle assembly for use with a 

catheter which assembly contains a pleated sleeve made 
from any natural or synthetic fiber material is 

provided. The fiber materials employed as the pleated 
sleeve optionally may be treated with a suitable agent 

that provides the fiber material with a hydrophobic 
coating and prevents fluids such as blood from seeping 

therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides an improved 
self-capping disposable needle assembly for use in 
combination with a skin puncture apparatus. More 
specifically, the present invention relates to an 
improved self-capping disposable needle assembly for 
use with a skin puncture apparatus such as a catheter 
assembly which contains a pleated sleeve made from any 
natural or synthetic fiber material. Moreover, the 
fiber material employed as the pleated sleeve may be 
braided, non-woven or woven and it, optionally, may be 
treated with a suitable agent that provides the fiber 
with a hydrophobic coating. Such a coating will 
prevent unwanted fluids such as blood from seeping 
through the fiber material during use. In today's health industry, there is an 
ongoing risk of exposure to infectious diseases such as 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other AIDS 
related viruses by health care workers who are 
continuously utilizing skin puncture apparatuses for 
injecting patients with medicaments. The term skin 
puncture apparatus is used herein to denote devices 
that are employed in the medical profession to pierce 
the skin of a patient. Such devices include IV 
catheter assemblies, intrascopic devices, hypodermic 
syringe assemblies, biopsy needles and sutures. Because of this potential risk, disposable 
needles are considered by many individuals in the  
 
health care industry as being potentially infective and 
are accordingly handled with great care to avoid 
accidental contamination and/or injury. Moreover, a 
great deal of effort has gone into developing improved 
needle assemblies which are safer to handle and which 
prevent accidents from occurring. One way of avoiding accidental contamination 
and/or injury is to advise health care workers to place 
disposable needles in puncture resistant containers. 
Although the use of puncture resistant containers 
represents a viable solution to the aforementioned 
problem, it is not a practical way since it presupposes 
that puncture resistant containers are available in all 
circumstances wherein contamination could occur. In recent years it has become more convenient 
and safer to provide capping assemblies secured to each 
needle for immediate capping after use of the needle. 
One such capping assembly is disclosed in U.S. Patent 
No. 3,134,380 to Armao. Specifically, this patent 
discloses a retractable needle guard which extends over 
the length of the needle assembly prior to use and is 
retracted as the needle is inserted into a patient. In

<CLAIMS>
A disposable needle assembly, for use in combination 
with a skin puncture apparatus, said assembly comprising a 

needle assembly which contains a pleated sleeve, wherein 
said pleated sleeve is made from a natural or synthetic 

fiber material. 
The assembly of claim 1 wherein said needle assembly 
further comprises: 


a hub portion for connecting said needle assembly to a 
fluid conduit, said hub portion including a passageway 

extending therethrough; 
a hollow needle portion in fluid communication with said 
hub passageway, said needle portion having a distal tip 

relative to said hub portion; 
a cap including said pleated sleeve for connecting the 
hub portion to said cap and limiting the extent to which the 

cap can be extended from the hub portion; and 
locking means for locking said cap over said distal tip 
when said pleated sleeve is fully extended; 
said cap having a neutral position along said needle 
portion near said hub portion of said needle assembly for 

exposing a length of said needle portion, and an extended 
position for capping said distal tip. 
The assembly of claim 2 wherein said skin puncture 
apparatus is a catheter assembly, an intrascopic device, a 

syringe needle apparatus, a biopsy needle or a suture and is 
preferably a catheter assembly. 
The assembly of claim 3, wherein the skin puncture 
apparatus is a catheter assembly and wherein said catheter 

assembly includes a passageway therethrough, a shaft portion 
disposed about said exposed length of said needle portion 

and exposing said distal tip, and a catheter hub for 
releasable seating on said cap whereby removal of said 

needle portion from said shaft portion moves said cap 
 

relative to said needle portion to said extended position 
capping said distal tip as said catheter hub is unseated 

from said cap. 
The assembly of claim 4 where said cap further includes 
a releasable securing means for positively securing said cap 

with said catheter assembly as said needle portion is 
disposed within said passageway of said catheter assembly 

and releasing said cap from said catheter assembly when said 
cap is moved to said extended position whereby removal of 

said needle portion from said passageway of said catheter 
assembly moves said cap relative to said needle portion to 

said extended position capping said distal tip as said 
capping means is unseated from said catheter assembly. 
A disposable needle assembly for use in combination with 
a skin puncture apparatus, said assembly comprising: 


a catheter assembly including a passageway therethrough; 
a hub portion for connecting said needle assembly to 
said catheter assembly, said hub portion including a 

passageway extending therethrough; 
a hollow needle portion in fluid communication with said 
hub passageway, said needle portion having a distal tip 

relative to said hub portion; 
a cap including (i) a pleated sleeve for connecting the 
hub portion to said cap and limiting the extent to which the 

cap can be extended from the hub portion, wherein said 
pleated sleeve is composed of a natural or synthetic fiber 

material; (ii) locking means for locking said cap over said 
distal tip when said pleated sleeve is fully extended, said 

cap having a neutral position along said needle portion near 
said hub portion of said needle assembly for exposing a 

length of said needle portion and an extended position for 
capping said distal tip; and (iii) a releasable securing 

means for positively securing said cap with said catheter 
assembly as said needle portion is disposed within said 

passageway of said catheter assembly and releasing said cap 
from said catheter assembly when said cap is moved to said 

 
extended position whereby removal of said needle portion 

from said passageway of said catheter assembly moves said 
cap relative to said needle portion to said extended 

position capping said distal tip as said capping means is 
unseated from said catheter assembly. 
The assembly of claim 6 wherein said catheter assembly 
further includes a shaft portion disposed about said exposed 

length of said needle portion and exposing said distal tip, 
and a catheter hub for releasable seating on said cap 

whereby removal of said needle portion from said shaft 
portion moves said cap relative to said needle portion to 

said extended position capping said distal tip as said 
catheter hub is unseated from said cap. 
The assembly of any one of claims 1 to 7 wherein the 
fiber material is braided, woven or non-woven. 
The assembly of claim 8 wherein the fiber material is 
silk, cotton, rayon, linen, wool, satin, nylon, polyester or 

mixtures thereof and is preferably polyester. 
The assembly of any one of claims 1 to 9 wherein the 
fiber material is treated with an agent which is effective 

to provide a hydrophobic coating to said fiber. 
The assembly of claim 10 wherein said agent is a
