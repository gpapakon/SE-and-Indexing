<ABSTRACT>
A glass holder (1) is provided which is used to hold a 
glass stably at the edge of a dish. A glass holder (1) comprises 

a glass holding body (1) shaped like a cup and a 
cylindrical mounting frame (2) vertically extending from the 

underside of the bottom of the glass holding body (1). The 
mounting frame (2) is cut horizontally halfway around to form 

a mounting section (8) so that the edge of a dish can freely 
be inserted into or removed from the mounting section (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a glass holder according 
to the preamble of claim 1, as already disclosed in JP-A-62-42473. In parties, when eating standing, one often has to 
hold a glass of drink and a hand-held dish at the same 
time. When a person picks up food and put it on his dish 
or when he eats the food, the glass should be put temporarily 
on a table or the like to free his hand. He also 
has to find an appropriate location on which to place his 
glass and to take care so that his glass will not be 
taken for other glasses placed near by. Because of such 
additional attention he may not be able to enjoy the 
party. At times the person may be forced to hold both 
glass and dish while eating and accidentally make a mess. To cope with such a problem, a glass holder has been 
proposed, which enables a person to hold with one hand 
both dish and glass with the glass held at the edge of 
the dish. Example patent applications that propose such 
a glass holder include Japanese Utility Model Preliminary 
Publication No. Showa 62-42473 mentioned above, 
Showa 63-138182, Heisei 
1-119570, and Heisei 1-179572. These glass holders have as basic constituent  
 
elements a holding section that holds a glass upright and 
a clamping section that clamps an edge of a dish to 
fix the holding section to the dish. In the Japanese 
Utility Model Preliminary Publication No. Showa 63-138182, 
when attached to a dish, the glass holder has its 
holding section located on the edge of the dish to 
support a glass. In other glass holders, the clamping 
section grips the edge of the dish with the holding 
section projecting out from the dish. Of the above-mentioned proposed glass holders, the 
former type holds a glass on the edge of the dish so that 
the glass is stable. But the glass holder of this type 
cannot be used to hold legged glasses. Since the holding 
section is formed by simply erecting four tongue pieces, 
the glass holders cannot be stacked one upon the other 
for easy storage. As for the latter three examples, on 
the other hand, since the holding section protrudes 
outside the edge of the dish, the glass holder can hold 
even legged glasses. However, because the glass is 
supported outside the dish, the clamping section is 
required to have a strong gripping force, which makes 
troublesome the procedure for attaching the clamping 
section to the dish. In light of the above-mentioned drawbacks of the  
 
conventional glass holders, the present invention has 
been accomplished to offer improvements in

<CLAIMS>
A glass holder comprising: 

a glass holding body (1) shaped like a cup; 
a mounting frame (2) vertically extending from the 
underside of the bottom (3) of the glass holding 

body (1), the mounting frame (2) having an arc wall 
surface; characterized by 
a mounting section (8) comprising a horizontal strip of 
cut formed in the mounting frame (2) so that an 

edge (b) of a dish (B) can freely be inserted into or 
removed from the strip of cut. 
The glass holder according to claim 1, wherein 
the mounting frame (2) is cylindrical. 
The glass holder according to claim 1, wherein 
the horizontal strip of cut of the mounting sec
tion (8) in 
the mounting frame (2) is progressively inclined upward from 

the center toward the ends of the strip of cut. 
The glass holder according to claim 1, wherein 
the glass holding body (1) has a vertical opening (5) at a part 

of a circumferential wall (4) thereof, and the glass holding 
body (1) also has an expandable spring which is formed by 

making a cut (6) in the lower part of the circumferential 
wall (4) running in the circumferential direction from the 

opening.  
 
The glass holder according to claim 2, wherein 
the cylindrical mounting frame (2) vertically extending from 

the underside of the bottom of the glass holding body (1) is 
so sized that it can be fitted inside the glass holding 

body (1). 
The glass holder according to claim 1, characterized by 

vertical openings (5, 10) formed in alignment in the arc or 
circumferential wall (4) of the glass holding body (1) 

and in the mounting frame (2) at positions opposite 
the side where the mounting section (8) is provided; 

and 
a glass leg holding section (11) comprising a cut formed 
in the bottom (3) of the glass holding body (1), the 

cut extending from the edge toward the center 
of the bottom (3) of the glass holding body (1) so that 

the cut is continuous to the openings. 
The glass holder according to claim 6, wherein 
the glass leg holding section (11) in the bottom (3) of the glass 

holding body (1) is formed to such a depth that it does not 
contact an edge (b) of a dish (B) fitted into the mounting 

section (8).
