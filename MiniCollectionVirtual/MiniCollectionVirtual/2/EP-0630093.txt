<ABSTRACT>
The member or box comprises: a slot means (11) under 
which ribs (10) of the tray (2) may be received and which has 

passages (12) on one side and an aperture (18) on the other 
side; a retaining member (30) attached to the slot means (11) 

and which is provided with a fold-down tab (16) and a tooth 
(20); fingers (13) resiliently attached to the base portion 

(3) and provided with teeth (15) inserted through the passages 
(12) and which may retain a rib (10); and resilient 

bridges (22) extending on a higher plane above the base portion 
(3) and facing the tab (16). 
The retaining member (30) is movable between a normal 
inactive position and an active position in which the tooth 

(20) is inserted through the aperture (18), retaining one of 
the free ends (10b) of the rib (10) and the bridges (22) 

retain the fold-down tab (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical mechanism support 
member applicable to a tray for electrical conductors, 
said tray having a bottom wall provided with a pair of longitudinal 
ribs having harpoon-shaped free ends, said member 
having a base portion adapted to bear against said bottom 
wall and a retaining member formed by a foldown tab defining 
at least one end locking finger and a tooth facing away from 
said tab; said retaining member being movable between an 
inactive position, which it normally occupies, and an active 
position. The trays are regularly provided with a lid and are 
attached to walls or other support means. As stated above, 
they are adapted to house conductors and on the bottom wall 
thereof they are provided with one or more arrow headed longitudinal 
ribs. These support members or boxes contain sundry apparatus 
or instruments which may be electrical, such as sockets, 
connectors, switches, protectors or branches, or of any other 
nature such as a hydraulic, mechanical, pneumatic or other 
items. Spanish Utility Model 206,123 relates to a box for fitting 
in trays the bottom wall of which is provided with longitudinal 
T-slots, while the box is provided on the bottom 
thereof with mutually aligned slits through which the bent 
ends of a holding member for engagement in the said slots 
pass, and so that the edge of this member opposite said bent 
ends engages a resilient tongue extending from a side wall 
of the box. In this solution there is to be appreciated the 
drawback of requiring two members to be assembled. On the other hand, Spanish Utility Model No. 223,179 
discloses a box having two slots on the base thereof aligned 
on each side of the base center line. These slots have on 
either side a resilient tab. A block attached to the box by 
means of thin lever-wedge torsion hinge like web is inserted 
in the slots. In this case the necessary stability of 
attachment of the box to the tray is not achieved.  
 Also known is Spanish Utility Model No. 224,727 in which 
a box is provided on the bottom wall thereof with a projecting 
flange for removable sliding snap fitting in a support 
guide member located in the bottom of the tray, plus an aperture 
through which there is assembled a moving member having 
a salient angled edge bordered by another also salient member, 
while the other flank forms a finned prominence to be 
retained in said aperture, said moving member also having a 
rear orifice for removal by leverage. This embodiment has the 
drawback that the moving

An electrical mechanism support member applicable to 
a tray for electrical conductors, said tray (2) having a 

bottom wall (5) provided with a pair of longitudinal ribs 
(10) having harpoon-shaped free ends (10a, 10b), said member 

having a base portion (3) adapted to bear against said bottom 
wall (5) and a retaining member (30) formed by a fold-down 

tab (16) defining at least one end locking finger (21) and a 
tooth (20) facing away from said tab (16); said retaining 

member (30) being movable between an inactive position, which 
it normally occupies, and an active position, characterized 

in that it comprises: 

a slot means (11) directed inwardly of the member from 
the base portion (3), which is attached to said retaining 

member by a connecting foot portion (19) and defining an 
internal cavity capable of receiving said ribs (10), a first 

side wall having passages (12) and a second side wall in 
which there is an aperture (18); said aperture (18) being 

adapted to receive therethrough said tooth (20) which is 
capable of retentively engaging one of said free ends (10b); 
fingers (13), each of which: (i) is opposite one of said 
passages (12); (ii) is attached to said base portion (3) by a 

resilient connecting portion (14); and (iii) has a salient 
tooth (15) inserted through a passage and which is capable of 

retentively engaging one of said free ends (10a); and 
at least one resilient bridge (22) extending on a higher 
plane above said base portion (3), facing an end locking 

finger (21), and which is capable of receiving it when said 
retaining member (30) is in said active position. 
The support member of claim 1, characterized in that 
said tab (16) has reinforcement gussets. 
The support member of either of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that said connecting foot portion (19) has a 

thin portion.
