<ABSTRACT>
A machine for the production of balls of minced product of 
meat, fish and such like comprises an extrusion pump (5) of a 

minced product (3), an apportioning device (40) of the product 
(3) itself and a sliding support (12) to receive product 

portions (4) of any shape delivered by said pump (5) through 
said device (40). A forming plate (13), located above said 

sliding support (12) at a distance substantially equal to the 
thickness of said product portions (4), moves in an alternating 

motion, in a transversal direction to that of the support (12), 
between two end positions, so that the combination of the 

motion imparted to said portions (4) by said plate (13) with 
that imparted by the support (12) imposes on the portions (4) 

themselves a rotation and translation motion suitable for 
imparting to said product portions (4) a rounded shape, in 

particular substantially spherical.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machine for the 
production of balls of minced meat, fish and such like with a 
rounded, in particular substantially spherical shape. The commercial success met by food products of minced meat, 
fish and such like that exhibit new external shapes, in 
particular in the shape of a small spherical ball, is well 
known. To this end there are several forming machines on the 
market, that comprise an apparatus for the extrusion of the 
minced product paste and, at the outlet, a forming device for 
apportioning the product and give it the desired shape; such 
forming device can be constituted by rollers having cells of 
the desired shape, as well as by extrusion tubes with various 
conformations provided with suitable apportioning blades. Such machines are fairly complex, and they are in any case 
different from traditional packing machines, essentially 
constituted by simple pumps with an apportioning device, from 
which the product is ejected with a necessarily cylindrical or 
prismatic shape, in any case always with a constant and never 
spherical cross-section. In view of the described state of the art, the object of the 
present invention is the provision of a machine for the 
production of balls of minced meat, fish and such like having 
a rounded, in particular substantially spherical shape, that 
can use the same pumps normally used in ordinary packing  
 
machines. According to the present invention, such object is attained 
thanks to a machine for the formation of balls comprising an 
extrusion pump, an apportioning device and a sliding support to 
receive product portions delivered by said pump through said 
apportioning device, characterized in that it also comprises a 
forming plate located above said sliding support, at a distance 
from the latter substantially corresponding to the thickness of 
said product portions, and alternately movable, in a direction 
perpendicular to that in which the sliding support moves, 
between two end positions under the action of motor means to 
impart to said portions, in combination with the sliding 
support, a rotation and translation motion suitable for 
imparting to them a rounded, in particular substantially 
spherical shape. In a preferred embodiment of the machine according to the 
invention, for the provision of balls with a spherical shape, 
the distance of the forming plate from the sliding support 
increases along the latter's direction of movement, so as to 
compensate for the increase in the diameter of the product

<CLAIMS>
Machine for the formation of balls (1) of minced product 
of meat, fish and such like comprising an extrusion pump (5), 

an apportioning device (40) and a sliding support (12) to 
receive product portions (4) delivered by said pump (5) through 

said apportioning device (40), characterized in that it also 
comprises a forming plate (13) located above said sliding 

support (12) at a distance from the latter substantially 
corresponding to the thickness of said product portions (4), 

and alternately movable, in a direction perpendicular to that 
in which the sliding support (12) moves, between two end 

positions under the action of motor means (17) to impart to 
said portions (4), in combination with the sliding support 

(12), a rotation and translation motion suitable for imparting 
to them a rounded, in particular substantially spherical shape. 
Machine according to claim 1, characterized in that said 
forming plate (13) is provided with a slit (14) engaged by a 

pin (15) integral with a drum (16) rotating under the action of 
said motor means
 (17), there being provided means (41) for the 
guidance of the transversal movement of the forming plate (13). 
Machine according to claim 1, characterized in that said 
forming plate (13) rests on adjustable spacers (20) that allow 

it to be inclined with respect to said sliding support (12) so 
that the distance of the forming plate (13) from the latter 

increases in the direction of its sliding movement. 
Machine according to claim 1, characterized in that there 
is a striker plate (19) under the sliding support (12) opposite 

the forming plate (13).
