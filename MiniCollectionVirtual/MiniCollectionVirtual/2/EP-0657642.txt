<ABSTRACT>
Fuel injection device for internal combustion engines with a high pressure accumulator (9), fillable by a high pressure fuel pump (1), from which accumulator high pressure lines (13) lead off to the individual injection valves (15). At the same time control valves (17) are inserted in the individual high pressure lines (13) in order to control the high pressure injection to the injection valves (15), together with an additional pressure reservoir (19) between the said control valves (17) and the high pressure accumulator (9). In order at the same time to prevent the high system pressure being constantly applied to the injection valves (15), the control valve (17) is designed so that, during the injection pauses on the injection valve (15) it closes its connection to the pressure reservoir (19) and opens a connection between injection valve (15) and a relief chamber (75).

Fuel injection device for internal combustion
engines, with a fuel high-pressure pump (1) which

conveys fuel out of a low-pressure space (5) into a
high-pressure collecting space (9) which is connected,

via high-pressure conduits (13), to injection valves
(15) which project into the combustion space of the

internal combustion engine to be supplied and the
opening and closing movement of which is controlled in

each case by an electrically activated control valve
(17) arranged in the high-pressure conduit (13) on the

injection valve (15) and having a piston-shaped valve
member (29), and with, on each injection valve (15), a

further pressure accumulator space (19) which is
integrated into the high-pressure conduit (13) between

the high-pressure collecting space (9) and the
injection valve (15), during the injection

intermissions the control valve (17) on the injection
valve (15) closing the connection of the further

pressure accumulator space (19) to a pressure space
(87) located within the injection valve (15) and acting

on the valve member (79) of the injection valve (15) in
the opening direction, the control valve (17) opening a

connection of the pressure space (87) of the injection
valve (15) to a relief space (75) during the injection

intermissions of the injection valve (15),
characterized in that the piston-shaped valve member

(29) has an annular web (39), of which one surface of
transition to the valve-member shank of smaller 

diameter forms a first valve sealing surface (41) cooperating
with a valve seat (43) and of which the other

transition to the valve-member shank of smaller
diameter takes place via an annular shoulder (53) which

has adjoining it, facing away from the annular web
(39), a guide-piston part (45) spaced from the annular

web (39) and of which the axial annular end surface
facing away from the annular web (39) forms a second

valve sealing surface (55) which co-operates with a
valve seat (59) fixed relative to the housing.
Fuel injection device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the stroke movement of the valve

member (29) of the control valve (17) is limited in
each case by the bearing of the valve sealing surfaces

(41, 55) on one of the valve seats (43, 59).
Fuel injection device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the outside diameter of the

annular shoulder (53) carrying the flat valve sealing
surface (55) is equal to the diameter of a guide piston

(45) of the valve member (29) in a guide bore (49), the
said guide piston adjoining an annular groove (47)

located on the valve member (29) and emanating from the
conical valve sealing surface (41), and the said guide

piston, at the same time, delimiting a pressure space
(51) formed between the wall of the guide 
bore (49) and
the valve member (29) in the region of the annular

groove (47).
Fuel injection device according to Claim 3,
characterized in that the annular web (39) is arranged

in a pre-space (65) constantly connected to a pressure
conduit (67) leading to the pressure space (87) of the

injection valve (15).
Fuel injection device according to Claim 4,
characterized in that the pressure space (51) in the

region of the annular groove (47) of the valve member
(29) is constantly connected to a part of the high-pressure

conduit (13) which leads away from the
pressure accumulator space (19). 
Fuel injection device according to Claims 4 and
5, characterized in that the connection between the

pre-space (65) and the pressure space (51) can be
closed by the bearing of the conical sealing surface

(41) of the valve member (29) on the conical valve seat
(43).
Fuel injection device according to Claim 4,
characterized in that, by designing the valve-member

shank adjoining the flat valve sealing surface (55) so
as to have a smaller diameter than a bore (57)
