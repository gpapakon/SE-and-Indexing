<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to grease
compositions which contain fluorinated polymer oils, hexagonal lattice boron
nitride powders
having a bimodal particle size distribution
and, optionally, solid fluorinated polymers.
Such compositions have been found to have exceptionally good
lubricating properties, even under severe operating
conditions.Boron nitride powders are used in the art because
they lower the coefficient of friction of metals which move
in contact with one another. The use of hexagonal lattice
boron nitride (HLBN) powder in grease compositions based on
silicon oils is also known in the art. For instance,
Japanese Patent Publication 62/043493 discloses a grease
composition comprising a polyorganosiloxane and boron nitride
powder. This reference, however, does not disclose the use
of fluorinated polymer oils, the combination of a solid
fluorinated polymer with boron nitride for fluorinated
greases, nor a bimodal distribution of boron nitride.Similarly, United States Air Force Report ASDTDR
63-656, part 1, titled "Rheology of Silicone Fluids Thickened
with Boron Nitride" (1963) discloses grease compositions
comprising a hydrogenated silicone fluid with a density of
1.02 g/ml combined with boron nitride powders. It is
revealed therein that 43.2 to 43.9 weight percent of a
standard coarse grain boron nitride is required to form a
consistent grease while only 14.5 to 19.7 weight percent of a
submicron particle size boron nitride is necessary to form
desirable greases. This reference, however, does not
describe the use of a fluorinated silicone fluid since the
density of fluorinated silicone fluid exceeds 1.02 g/ml (it 
is about 1.3 g/ml), the use of boron nitride powder having a
bimodal particle size distribution, nor the combination of a
fluorinated polymer with boron nitride for obtaining
fluorinated greases based on fluorinated polymer oils.The problem to be solved by the present invention
is to find grease compositions based on boron nitride having
exceptionally good lubricating properties even under severe
operating conditions. The solution has been found by the
grease compositions as described below.The present invention relates to a novel grease
composition containing between 55 and 95 weight percent of a
liquid fluorinated polymer oil and between 5 and 45 weight
percent of a thickener comprising boron nitride powder. The
boron nitride powder is characterized as having a bimodal
particle size distribution in which between 25 and 75 weight
percent of the boron nitride is an aggregate
