<ABSTRACT>
A control device for an internal combustion engine comprising fuel injection control means for controlling the amount of fuel that is injected from a fuel supply device for supplying fuel to an internal combustion engine and fuel injection timing, and variable valve control means for changing in a continuous or stepped fashion at least one of an open timing, a close timing and a valve lift of a suction valve or an exhaust valve for closing a combustion chamber of said internal combustion engine, wherein said fuel injection control means is constructed so as to control at least either of the amount of fuel that is injected based on the controlled variable of said variable valve control means or the injection timing. According to the present invention, it is possible to reduce pumping loss so as to improve fuel efficiency because an air volume can be controlled by the variable valve mechanism. In addition, the invention makes it possible not only to atomize fuel injected into the combustion chamber by opening said suction valve in such a manner as to cause shock waves in said combustion chamber but also to achieve stable combustion without deteriorating exhaust gas.
