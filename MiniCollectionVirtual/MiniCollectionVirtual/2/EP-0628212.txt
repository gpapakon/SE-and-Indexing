<ABSTRACT>
An enhanced DC plasma processing system which acts to immediately stop current from flowing through the plasma allows a variety of alternative embodiments for varying applications. In one embodiment, a tapped inductor (13 
&
 14) is switched to ground (9) to achieve substantial voltage reversal of about 10 % upon detection of an arc condition through voltage and/or rate of voltage change techniques. This reversal of voltage is maintained long enough to allow restoration of uniform charge density within the plasma (5) prior to restoration of the initial driving condition. A technique for preventing arc discharges involving periodically applying a reverse voltage is effected through a timer system (22) in the power supply (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to thin film processing
systems in which a plasma effects either etching, deposition,
or some other process. Specifically, the invention has
application to DC plasma processing when coating with metallic
materials or with materials formed by chemical reaction in the
coating process. It also involves power supply designs used
in such applications.The field of DC plasma processing for thin film
applications is one which is well known. In these processes,
a DC power supply creates an electric potential between a
cathode and anode and thereby creates a plasma. In the
deposition mode, the plasma then acts upon a material target
to create a thin film on some substrate. This thin film may
either be comprised of the target material itself or may be
the result of some reaction with some element within the
coating chamber. Naturally both the materials and elements
involved and the specific applications vary greatly.
Applications may range from coating architectural glass to the
creation of micro chips. One of the challenges in many
applications is that electrical discharges or arcs can occur.
This is particularly true when reactive processes are used and
the reactive product is an insulator, such as aluminum oxide
(Al2O3). As one example, this type of coating process is
particularly challenging because it involves both conductive
and insulating regions. As a result, the electrical
environment during plasma processing itself can be
particularly conducive to arc discharges. These arc
discharges are undesirable not only because they represent
potential non-uniformities in the coating process, but also
because they can further lead to unstable situations by
altering the release of coating material and negatively impact
processing throughput. Although the problem of arc occurrences has been well
known to those skilled in the art, it has been addressed with
only limited success. Initially it was common to completely
shut down the process and perhaps even clean the chamber
before restarting. In other instances, lower processing rates
were used to make the occurrences of arcs less frequent. More
recently, it has been attempted to divert the arc by quickly
shutting off the supply of power to the plasma itself.
Unfortunately, most such solutions acted only after damage had
been done and thus served to minimize ― but not completely
avoid ― problems in more sensitive processing environments.
In order to react as quickly as possible, switch-mode or low
energy storage power supplies have also
