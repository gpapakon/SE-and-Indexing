<ABSTRACT>
An optoelectronic semiconductor device (10) with a radiation-emitting 
semiconductor diode (3), preferably a diode laser (3), is particularly suitable as a 

radiation source in optical read and write systems such as bar code readers, laser 
printers, and optical disc systems. The diode (3) has one or two exit surfaces for 

radiation (R) which are provided with coatings (4). In such a device (10) it is found that 
a deposit rich in carbon is formed on the coating (4) of the laser (3), with the result that 

the output of the diode (3) fluctuates. The deposit may be avoided in that organic 
impurities are avoided or a selection is carried out in that respect. This is cumbersome 

and expensive. 
A device (10) according to the invention is characterized in that the diode 
(3) is present within an envelope (20) which is hermetically sealed off from the outer 

world (40), and a gaseous oxidizing compound (30) is present inside the envelope (20). 
It was surprisingly found that a gaseous oxidizing compound (30), preferably oxygen, 

counteracts or removes a deposit rich in carbon on the coating (4). Since the device (10) 
is hermetically sealed off from the outer world (40), degradation owing to water vapour 

or other aggressive gases is counteracted. The device (10) preferably contains dry and 
clean nitrogen to which at least approximately 0.2 vol.% oxygen (30) has been added. 

Particularly good results were obtained with a high-power laser (3) and a laser (3) 
which emits between approximately 0.6 and 0.9 µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optoelectronic semiconductor device
comprising a radiation-emitting semiconductor diode of which an exit surface for the
generated radiation is provided with a coating.Such a device is particularly suitable for use as a radiation source in, for
example, a optical glass fibre system, an optical disc system, and a bar code reader. In
the application first mentioned, the emission wavelength often lies between 1 and 1.5
µm, in the other applications often between 0.6 and 0.9 µm. The semiconductor
material systems corresponding therewith are InGaAsP/InP and (Al)GaAs/AlGaAs or
InGaP/InAlGaP, respectively.Such a device with an (AlGa)As diode laser as the radiation-emitting
diode is known from the article "Analysis of Rapid Degradation in High-Power
(AlGa)As laser diodes" by W.J. Fritz published in IEEE Journal of Quantum
Electronics, vol. 26, no. 1, January 1990, pp. 68-74. The device described therein
comprises a diode laser tested in a dry nitrogen atmosphere or in vacuum, the mirror
surfaces acting as exit surfaces for the radiation generated by the diode laser being
provided with an aluminium oxide or aluminium oxide-silicon coating which is
impermeable to gases. It was found that a layer rich in carbon is deposited on this
coating during operation of the diode layer, which layer originates from organic
impurities contained in the flux and flux cleaning liquid used during soldering of the
diode laser. The diode laser is not stable in this case, i.e. the output power decreases
(or fluctuates) strongly in time, for example, owing to changes in the (effective)
reflection of the radiation at the mirror surface provided with the coating. Strongly
improved characteristics were obtained by means of more stringent cleaning instructions
and selection on the basis of the hydrocarbon content.A disadvantage of the known device is that it is comparatively difficult to
manufacture owing to the stringent cleaning requirements, and accordingly is
comparatively expensive. The price of the known device is also adversely affected by 
the reject percentage in the selection process.The present invention has for its object inter alia to provide an
optoelectronic semiconductor device with a radiation-emitting diode having an exit
surface for radiation provided with a coating, which device does not or at least to a
much lesser extent have the said disadvantages, can be readily and cheaply
manufactured, and is very stable and accordingly has a long useful life.According to the invention, an
