<ABSTRACT>
New compositions for the effective treatment of 
psoriasis, containing no mercury salts and based on the 

combination of distilled aqueous extracts of plantain 
(Plantago major L.), wild rose (Rosa canina L.) and bitter 

orange (Citrus aurantium L.). 
Also described is a procedure for obtaining said 
compositions by mixing the vegetable extracts, eliminating 

part of the total volume by distillation and compensating 
the volume distilled with 96° alcohol. 
The new compositions described are highly effective 
in treating the symptoms of the disease, they reduce the 

risk of relapses and furthermore exhibit excellent tolerance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to therapeutic compositions 
for topical use for the treatment of psoriasis, 
based on the combination of distilled aqueous extracts 
of vegetables, and a procedure for obtaining them. Psoriasis is a common, chronic and recurring disease, 
characterized by the formation of dry and well-defined 
patches and silvery peeling scales of different 
sizes on certain areas of the epidermis. It characteristically 
affects the scalp, the extensor surfaces of the 
extremities, in particular the elbows and knees, the 
back and the buttocks, as well as the nails, eyebrows, 
axillae, naval and anogenital region. Occasionally the 
disease is generalized. Its causes are unknown and therefore current forms 
of treatment are of the symptomatic type. An effective 
treatment is therefore considered to be one which 
achieves a high percentage of remission of the lesions 
over a relatively long period without the reappearance 
of said lesions. There are various medicines for treating psoriasis 
but which in general involve problems and complications. 
For example, methotrexate and etretinate are too toxic 
to for continued preventative treatment. Salicylic acid 
is only effective in mild cases. Coal tar, which is normally 
used together with zinc oxide, is often not  
 
accepted by the patient due to its unpleasant smell and 
the fact that it is difficult to apply. Ditranol, despite 
its effectiveness, is irritating to the epidermis 
and produces stains on the clothes, nails and skin. The 
corticoids for topical use suffer from the drawback of 
tachyphylaxis and furthermore when treatment is stopped 
the symptoms suddenly reappear. Finally, ultra-violet 
radiation treatment has problems associated with its 
long term effects, such as premature aging of the skin 
and the increased risk of skin cancer. The use of extracts of natural origin is also known 
in the topical treatment of the disease. The PCT patent 
application number 89/05651 proposes the use of oily 
extracts of a collection of plants such as garlic, the 
common nettle and veronica, etc. The European patent 
application number 367103 describes the use of ointments 
made with jojoba and beeswax or spermaceti. Finally, the 
Spanish patent number 2.006.474 describes the use of 
extracts of plants belonging to the family of the zygophyllaceae 
together with an aqueous solution of a non-alkali 
metal halide. There are thus many methods of treatment but none 
of them are sufficiently safe and effective and as a 
result there is a need for

<CLAIMS>
Therapeutic compositions containing no mercury 
salts for use in the treatment of psoriasis, characterized 

in that they consist essentially of the combination 
of distilled aqueous extracts of the leaves and spikes 

of plantain (Plantago major L.), the petals of wild rose 
(Rosa canina L.) and the flowers of bitter orange (Citrus 

aurantium L.). 
Therapeutic compositions according to claim 1, 
characterized in that they are prepared by mixing the 

following components in the proportions shown: 
Plantain water45-60 % (V/V) Rose water20-35 % (V/V) Orange flower water10-20 % (V/V)  

relative to the total volume of the mixture, where (V/V) 
indicates proportion by volume, followed by the elimination 

by distillation of between 5 and 20% of the 
initial volume of the mixture, compensating the volume 

distilled with an equal volume of 96° ethanol. 
Therapeutic compositions according to claim 2, 
characterized in that the proportion by volume of plantain 

water in the initial mixture is greater than 50%
