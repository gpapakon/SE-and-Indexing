<ABSTRACT>
A system for detecting air-fuel ratio of an 
internal combustion engine by sampling outputs of an air-fuel 

ratio sensor installed at an exhaust system confluence 
point of said engine. A timing map is prepared to be retrieved 

by the engine speed and manifold absolute pressure 
to determine one among sampled data which are successively 

stored in buffers. It is selected such that as the engine 
speed decreases or the manifold absolute pressure increases, 

a datum sampled at earlier crank angular position is selected. 
At an engine equipped with a variable valve timing 

mechanism, a datum sampled at earlier crank angular position 
is selected in the valve timing is controlled for high 

engine speed provided that the engine speed and manifold 
absolute pressure is constant. The sampled data stored in 

the buffers may be transferred to another buffers at a 
predetermined crank angular position. The sampled data is 

corrected by an environmental conditions including atmospheric 
pressure, a mixture or sensor degradation. Each 

buffer may have a plurality of sampled data.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an air-fuel ratio
detection system for an internal combustion engine, more
particularly to an air-fuel ratio detection system for a
multicylinder internal combustion engine which enables to
select one among outputs of an air-fuel ratio sensor sampled
at a timing most optimum under the engine operating conditions
and based on the sampled datum, to detect the air-fuel
ratio of the engine correctly.It is a common practice to install an air-fuel
ratio sensor at the exhaust system of an internal
combustion engine to detect the air-fuel ratio at that
location. A system of this type is taught by Japanese
Laid-Open Patent Publication No. Sho 59(1984)-101,562, for
example. Similarly, the applicant earlier proposed designing
a model describing the behavior of the exhaust system
and inputting the air-fuel ratio detected by an air-fuel
ratio sensor disposed at the exhaust confluence point, and
constructing an observer for estimating the air-fuel ratios
at the individual cylinders from the confluence point air-fuel
ratio. (Japanese Patent Application No. Hei 3-359338;
Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. Hei 5-180040 which
was filed in the United States under the number of 
07/997,769 and in EPO under the number of 92311841.8). The
sensor used there is not an O2 sensor which produces an
inverted output only in the vicinity of the stoichiometric
air-fuel ratio, but a wide-range air-fuel ratio sensor which
produces a detection output proportional to the oxygen
concentration of the exhaust gas.Moreover, Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication
Hei 1-313,644 proposes a technique in which the appropriateness
of air-fuel detection is checked at every predetermined
crank angular position.According to US-A-4 864 998 the air-fuel ratio and other operating
conditions are detected and the air-fuel signal is sampled.The sampled air-fuel ratios are stored in the form of flags. A
combination of flags corresponds to the storage of a previously
sampled lean state and a currently sampled rich state of the air-fuel
sensor output. Under these circumstances the presently
sampled rich state is chosen according to the detected engine
operating condition so as to control the air-fuel ratio.In the air-fuel ratio detection, since the
remaining burned gas in the cylinder is swept out by a
piston in the course of an exhaust stroke, the behavior of
the air-fuel ratio at the exhaust system confluence point of
a multicylinder internal combustion engine is conceived to
be synchronous with the Top Dead Center crank
