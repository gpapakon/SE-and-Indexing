<ABSTRACT>
Retractable terminal, particularly for the road network, comprising a movable body (5) capable of displacement in a substantially corresponding housing or box (4), open at its top end, between a service position wherein said body (5) extends fixedly over the level of the open extremity of the housing (5) and a rest position wherein said body (5) has its apex substantially flush with the open extremity of the housing (4), characterized in that the movable body (5) comprises an integrated electric distribution point, supplied by a current source (20) to provide for the operation of at least one consumer (21, 22) arranged on said movable body (5) or connected thereto through a cable (23).

<CLAIMS>
A retractable bollard, particularly one used on 
roads, comprising a movable bollard body (5) capable of 

being displaced inside a housing made in a chamber (4), 
open at its upper end, between an operating position in 

which said body (5) extends above the level of the open 
end of the chamber (4) and a rest position in which 

said body (5) extends with its tip substantially level 
with the open end of the chamber (4), the movable 

bollard body (5) constituting an electrical 
distribution point supplied by a power source (20) 

comprising at least one power socket (25) via which an 
external consumer (22) can be connected to the electric 

power source (20) when said bollard is in the operating 
position, characterised in that the electric socket(s) 

(25) is/are arranged in at least one watertight housing 
(29) provided on the body of the bollard (5) and made 

accessible via a lockable door (30) also comprising 
watertight closing means. 
A bollard according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that it comprises a safety device (21) connected to the 

power source (20) arranged on the movable bollard body 
(5) and allowing it to transmit signals during its 

displacement and/or when in the operating position. 
A bollard according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the safety device (21) comprises optical 

signalling means. 
A bollard according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the optical signalling means consist of a 

transmission of alternating light signals (24) known as 
"flashing lights" and/or a transmission of continuous 

light signals according to predetermined operating 
cycles for each type of signal transmission.  

 
A bollard according to one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterised in that the signalling is performed by a 

steady transmission of light in the operating position 
and by a transmission of alternating light signals (24) 

known as "flashing lights" during its displacement. 
A bollard according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that it comprises means for preventing retraction into 

its housing when at least one door (30) of a watertight 
housing (29) enclosing at least one socket (25) is in 

the open position. 
A bollard according to Claim 1 or Claim 6, 
characterised in that the door(s) of the watertight 

housing(s) enclosing the socket(s) (25) is/are 
articulated via hinges (35) having play at the front so 

as to distribute uniformly the clamping effect when the 
door(s) is/are closed (30).
