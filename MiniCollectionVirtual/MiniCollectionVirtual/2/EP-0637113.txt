<ABSTRACT>
In a spark plug having an electrode metal made 
from a heat-and erosion-resistant nickel alloy whose 

front end has a noble metal tip made of iridium or 
ruthenium, the electrode metal has a thermal conductivity 

of 30 W/m·K or greater than 30 W/m·K. The electrode metal 
clads a heat-conductive core, and a front end of the core 

is in direct contact with the noble metal tip, otherwise 
the front end of the core is located near the noble metal 

tip by within a range of 1.5 mm instead of being in 
direct contact with the noble metal tip.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a spark plug, in particular to a 
spark plug for internal combustion engines, wherein the spark 
plug has a centre electrode including a metal made from a heat-and 
erosion-resistant nickel alloy, the front end of which, at which 
the spark is formed, has a noble metal tip made of iridium or 
ruthenium. In a spark plug electrode for an internal combustion engine, 
one may use a noble metal tip which has been made of iridium or 
ruthenium, since they are more resistant to spark-erosion than 
other noble metals such as platinum or the like. This is because 
iridium and ruthenium have a higher melting point (2447°C, 2310°C 
respectively) than that of platinum by 600-700°C. However, iridium and ruthenium are particularly vulnerable 
to oxidation-based evaporation at high temperatures and thus are 
more quickly corroded when the temperature exceeds a critical 
point. That is to say, when made of iridium or ruthenium wear of 
the noble metal tip is accelerated at this critical temperature. In order to avoid the rapid wear of the noble metal tip, 
Japanese Patent Application No. 4-350 discloses a centre 
electrode 100 for a spark plug, as shown in Fig. 6. In the 
5 centre electrode 100, a recess 102 is provided on a front end of 
an electrode metal 101, and a noble metal tip 103 is fixedly 
placed in the recess 102. The electrode metal 101 clads a heat-conductive 
core 104 whose front end 104a is located near a front 
end 103a of the noble metal tip 103. The heat-conductive core  
 
104 works to draw a considerable amount of heat from the noble 
metal tip 103 so as to keep the temperature of the tip 103 from 
rising excessively. In this instance, the electrode 101 is made of Inconel 600 
so as to resist satisfactorily the thermal stress caused by a 
difference in the thermal expansion between the noble metal tip 
103 and the front end of an electrode metal 101. Inconel 600 has 
a good physical strength at high temperature, but the constructed 
spark plug does not draw the heat from the noble metal tip 103 
sufficiently efficiently. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
spark plug having a centre electrode including an electrode metal 
of a heat-and erosion-resistant nickel alloy, wherein the front 
end of the centre electrode is a noble metal tip made of iridium 
or ruthenium; and characterised in that the nickel alloy has a thermal 
conductivity of about 30 W.m-1.K-1 or greater. Preferably, the electrode metal clads a heat-conductive 
core, and a front end of the
