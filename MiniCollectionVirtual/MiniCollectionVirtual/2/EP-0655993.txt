<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved process for the rhodium-catalyzed 
hydrocarboxylation of butadiene to form 3-pentenoic acid. In U.S. 4,690,912, Paulik et al. disclose a bromide- or iodide-promoted 
rhodium catalyst system for the carbonylation of carbonylatable 
reactants. In Example 55, butadiene is converted to greater than 79 wt. % C5 
carboxylic acids. In U.S. 4,622,423, Burke discloses the preparation of 3-pentenoic 
acid by hydrocarboxylating butadiene with carbon monoxide and water in the 
presence of a rhodium-containing catalyst, an iodide promoter and certain 
halocarbon solvents. Methylene chloride is the preferred solvent; acetic acid in 
aqueous solution is said to be undesirable. In U.S. 4,788,334, Burke discloses a process for the 
hydrocarboxylation of linear olefinically unsaturated esters and terminally 
unsaturated alkenes having 4 to 16 carbon atoms to form a mixture which 
contains an increased amount of the linear carboxylic acid. The reaction mixture 
comprises the ester or the terminally unsaturated alkene, carbon monoxide, 
water, a halocarbon or aromatic solvent, a rhodium catalyst, an iodide promoter 
and a mildly acidic accelerator. In U.S. 3,816,488, Craddock et al. disclose an improved process for 
the production of carboxylic acids by the reaction of ethylenically unsaturated 
compounds with carbon monoxide and water, in the presence of catalyst 
compositions essentially comprising rhodium compounds and complexes, 
together with an iodide promoter in critical proportions (I:Rh = 3:1 to 200:1) to 
obtain predominantly linear products. In EP-A-405433, Burke discloses a process for the 
preparation of 3-pentenoic acid which comprises reacting in a solvent consisting 
essentially of at least one carboxylic acid selected from C2-C20 
carboxylic acids, benzoic acid and alkyl-substituted benzoic acids wherein 
the total number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group(s) is not more than 3: butadiene, 
carbon monoxide, and water with a rhodium catalyst and a promoter selected 
from the class consisting of bromide and iodide at a temperature of about 40째C 
to 200째C at a carbon monoxide pressure of 75 to 3000 psig (0.6 to 20.8 MPa) 
wherein the rhodium concentration is 0.005% to 0.50% and the molar ratio of 
promoter to rhodium is between 1:1 and 20:1.  
 In U.S. 4,645,863, Rebafka et al. disclose a process for the 
preparation of unsaturated alcohols and/or esters thereof by reacting conjugated 
dienes with water and/or aqueous lower aliphatic carboxylic acid solutions in the 
prese
