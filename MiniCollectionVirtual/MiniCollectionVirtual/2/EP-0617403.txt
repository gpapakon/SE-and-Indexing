<ABSTRACT>
A keyboard instrument selectively enters into an 
acoustic sound mode for producing piano tones and into an 

electronic sound mode for producing synthetic tones, and 
comprises an acoustic piano (100), an electronic sound 

generating system (200) and a mode controlling system 
(300), wherein the mode controlling system has a stopper 

slidable along strings (150) of the acoustic piano so that 
the strings are struck by or blocked from hammers (145) of 

the acoustic depending upon the position of the stopper.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a keyboard instrument and,
more particularly, to a keyboard instrument selectively
entering into an acoustic sound mode and a silent mode.While a player is practicing a piano, some neighbors
feel the piano tones discomfortable, and wants to practice
without disturbance of the neighborhood. Various mufflers
have been proposed for acoustic pianos, and one of the
mufflers is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Publication
(Kokai) of Utility Model Application No. 51-67732, and the
muffler is implemented by a shock absorber downwardly
movable for decreasing the loudness of piano tones.
Namely, while a player is performing a music with a
standard volume, the shock absorber remains in an spaced
position from hammer shanks, and depressed keys causes the
associated key action mechanisms to rotate the hammer heads
for striking the strings without interruption of the shock
absorber. However, if the player wants to perform a music
with small tones, the shock absorber is pulled down toward 
the hammer shanks, and becomes engageable with the hammer
shanks. In this situation, while the player depresses the
keys, the hammer shanks and the hammer heads concurrently
strike the associated strings and the shock absorber, and,
for this reason, the strings weakly vibrate for producing
the piano tones.However, the muffler disclosed in the Japanese
Unexamined Publication can not perfectly extinguish the
piano tones, and the disturbance takes place under a
performance with the decreased piano tones.Another prior art grand piano disclosed in U.S.P.
2,250,065 perfectly extinguishes the piano tones, and a
silent mechanism incorporated in the prior art grand piano
prevents the neighborhood from the disturbance. The silent
mechanism disclosed in the U.S. Patent spaces the hammer
assemblies from the associated jacks, and does not allow
the jacks to rotate the hammer assemblies. In other words,
even if a player depresses the keys, the depressed keys
only push up the associated whippen assemblies, and the
jacks do not reach the hammer assemblies.Although the silent mechanism disclosed in the U.S.
Patent protects the neighborhood against the piano tones,
the player feels the key-touch strange. An ordinary 
acoustic piano gives a unique key-touch to a player, and an
escape of the jack from the hammer assembly produces the
unique key-touch. Therefore, the prior art silent
mechanism destroys the unique key-touch, and a player can
not practice the fingering on the keyboard for a recital.Document DE-A-37 07 591
