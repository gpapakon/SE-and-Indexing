<ABSTRACT>
A curable resin composition containing (a) a homo- or 
copolymer of an organohydrogenpolysiloxane macromonomer, 

(b) an alkenyl group-containing polymer, and (c) a 
hydrosilylation catalyst is disclosed. The organohydrogenpolysiloxane 

macromonomer may be incorporated into a single 
polymer entity together with an alkenyl group-containing 

monomer unit to produce a self-crosslinkable copolymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel curable resin
composition. More particularly, it relates to a novel
curable resin composition having excellent weatherability
and other physico-chemical properties.Heretofore a variety of curable resin compositions are
known in the coating industry including those comprising
hydroxyl group-containing acrylic or polyester polymers and
a crosslinker such as melamine resins or organic
polyisocyanates. The melamine resin-crosslinking
compositions must suffer not only from volumetric shrinkage
upon curing due to the emanation of lower alkanol by-products
but also from a decreased weatherability
particularly when exposed to acid rain due to the presence
of triazine nuclei. The polyisocyanate-crosslinking system
has problems of toxicity, decreasing weatherability with
time and yellowing.
US 5,039,761 describes methacryl-functional dimethylpolysiloxanes,
which can be polymerized with other ethylenically unsaturated
compounds, thus yielding graft copolymers. They exhibit
water repellency, mold release properties, slip properties,
weatherability, and gas permeability. Curable resin
compositions are not provided. Japanese Laid Open ( Kokai ) Patent Application Nos.
36109/82 and 155660/83 disclose a system having an enhanced
weatherability comprising room temperature-curable
alkoxysilyl group-bearing acrylic polymers. This system has 
certain defects that the curing reaction proceeds slowly,
that the cured product can be blotted with by-products
produced by the hydrolysis of residual alkoxysilyl groups
and that its rust prevention property is not satisfactory.Japanese Patent Publication ( Kokoku ) No. 33152/88
discloses a thermosetting resin system utilizing a reaction
between an alkoxysilyl component and a hydroxyl group-containing
resin component. This system is also
disadvantageous in that its curing reaction proceeds slowly
and the resulting cured film exhibits a poor salt spray
resistance.It has long been known in the art to crosslink
vinylpolysiloxanes with organohydrogenpolysiloxanes in the
presence of a platinum catalyst. Unfortunately, the cured
product of this composition is swellable with conventional
organic solvents and thus exhibits poor solvent resistance
as well as poor alkali resistance. This composition also
has a poor over laying property when used for coating
purposes. These defects have precluded the composition from
its application to coating compositions of general use.In addition, the above hydrosilyl reaction by the
organohydrogenpolysiloxanes has been
