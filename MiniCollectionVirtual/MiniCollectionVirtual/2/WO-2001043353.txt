<DESCRIPTION>
 Network Access Communication SystemTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to the field of communication systems. More particularly, this invention comprises methods and apparatus for providing many individual customers with symmetric access to a broad-band, wide-area network, especially where capable telecommunications infrastructure is nonexistent or very expensive to install.BACKGROUND ARTIn the past few years, a new information revolution has caused the demand for communications to skyrocket. The emergence of the Internet as a new distribution and business medium, coupled with the continuing improvements in computing speed and power, have strained the ability of conventional networks to meet this burgeoning demand. The installed base of conventional copper wires present inherent limitations and constraints to providing enhanced levels of communications services. Although new compression and signal processing techniques have enabled telephone companies to offer faster speeds and greater bandwidth using new services such as ISDN, DSL and ADSL, the market demand for more capacity will soon outpace these recent innovations. The use of optical fiber and cable television networks for new modes of communication is increasing, but fibers and cables have their own drawbacks and are relatively expensive to install and to maintain. Several satellite systems, including Teledesic™, Iridium™ and Globalstar™, are planning to offer world-wide high-speed services, but most of these companies will not roll out their full panoply of services for several years.Each of these technologies supplies part of a solution to the problem of offering an improved global network, but none of them have yet conquered the holy grail of the telecommunications industry, the "last mile" of service. The most expensive segment of furnishing service to a customer is usually the last mile of the connection to the customer's location.Several attempts to solve the problem of distributing information to large numbers of subscribers have met with mixed results. A number of these attempts are summarized below. U.S. Patent No. 2,288,802 issued to John Hays Hammond in 1942 and entitled Signaling System discloses a radio transmission system which employs a carrier wave that is transmitted in two substantially independent channels. The channels are "made independent" by using polarizations which propagate at right angles to each other. The carrier waves may also be modulated "by the same signal frequency, but with a predetermined phase
