<ABSTRACT>
A method of making an elongate mandrel (1) having an 
end integral with a drill section (4), the method comprising 

the steps of: subjecting a single columnar piece of material 
to the heading process so as to make a blank "N" composed 

of the mandrel, a short stem (2) having one end integral 
with the end of the mandrel and having a diameter "D" greater 

than the diameter "d" of the mandrel, and a flange (3) formed 
integrally with the other end of the stem; then cold forging 

the stem to produce the drill section having end edges (7a) 
and (7b) facing the flange; and subsequently trimming the 

drill section so as to remove the flange (3) together with 
scrap (10) resulting from the cold forging
 of the stem, 
in such a manner that the mandrel having the integral drill 

section can be mass produced from the single raw piece, 
efficiently at a reduced cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
The prior art "self-drilling blind rivet" comprises 
a tubular rivet body and an elongate mandrel inserted through 
the rivet body. The mandrel has at its one end a drill 
section capable of self-drilling an object in which the 
blind rivet is to be attached. The drill section has 
an outer diameter comparatively greater than that of the 
tubular rivet body. However, there has not been offered 
any effective method to form in a mass-production manner 
such a drill section at the end of said elongate mandrel. 
Consequently, a great demand for this type of blind rivet 
has not been met with a sufficient supply. The present inventor, who had made best efforts to supply 
such an unsatisfied demand, already proposed a method 
as disclosed in the Japanese Patent Laying-Open Gazette 
Hei. 2-197347 ( corresponding to the Unites States Patent 
No. 4,998,853 ). In this method, a short drill tip is 
adjoined or welded to one end of a mandrel. This previous method has however proved not necessarily  
 
satisfactory due to a certain difficulty in ensuring an 
coaxial relationship between each mandrel and each drill 
tip jointed thereto. Thus, the mass production of the 
blind rivet according to the previous method proposed by 
the present inventor has not been realized yet, because 
a specially designed automatic welder is needed therefor 
but has not been offered. GB-A-1 392 601 describes a method of forming an elongate mandrel 
having an end integral with a drill section by cold forging a 
short stem integral with the end of the mandrel and having a 
diameter greater than the diameter of the mandrel, to form the 
drill section, and trimming the drill section to remove 
therefrom the scrap resulting from the cold forging.  
 According to the present invention there is provided a 
method of making an elongate mandrel having 
an end integral with a drill section does comprise the steps 
of: subjecting a single columnar piece of material to a 
heading process so as to make a blank composed of the elongate 
mandrel having a diameter "d", a short stem integral 
with the end of the mandrel and having a diameter "D" greater 
than the diameter "d" of the mandrel, and a flange integral with 
the short stem and extending from one end thereof opposite 
to the mandrel; then cold forging the stem to produce the 
drill section having end edges disposed to face the flange; 
and subsequently trimming the drill section so as to remove 
therefrom the flange together with scrap possibly resulting 
from the cold forging of the short

A method of making an elongate mandrel (1) having an 
end integral with a drill section (4), the method comprising 

the steps of: 

subjecting a single columnar piece of material to 
a headin
g process so as to make a blank composed of 
the elongate mandrel having a diameter "d", a short stem (2) 

integral with the end of the mandrel and having a diameter 
"D" greater than the diameter "d" of the mandrel, and a flange (3) 

integral with the short stem and extending from one end 
thereof opposite to the mandrel; 
then cold forging the stem to produce the drill section 
having end edges (7a, 7b) disposed to face the flange; and 
subsequently trimming the drill section so as to 
remove therefrom the flange together with scrap (10) possibly 

resulting from the cold forging of the short stem. 
A method according to claim 1, further comprising 
the step of forming a breakable annular groove (37) or recessed 

zone on a portion intermediate the opposite ends of the 
mandrel. 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, further comprising  
 

the step of preliminarily forming an anuular recess (37) at 
a boundary between the stem's portion from which the 

drill section is to be cold forged and the stem's other 
portion which is to remain unforged, wherein the step 

is conducted before the following step of cold forging. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein a plurality 
of radially extending protrusions (14) are formed on a shoulder 

surface between the stem and the mandrel at the same 
time as the blank is formed in the heading process. 
A method acccording to any one of claims 1 to 4, and 
further comprising the step of selectively hardening 

the drill section of the blank by using a high-frequency 
heating apparatus, wherein the blank is made of a hardenable 

steel. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, and 
further comprising the step of selectively hardening 

the drill section of the blank by using a high-frequency 
heating apparatus, after previously carburizing the blank, 

wherein the blank is made of a low carbon steel.
