<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing amino resins based on formaldehyde, urea and dialdehyde, which are used as adhesive for cellulose-based products. In the method, formaldehyde, aliphatic dialdehyde and urea are condensed in two of more stages, such that in stage (1) the molar ratio of formaldehyde to urea is 2.6-5.0/1 and pH 3.5-6.5 and the condensation temperature 70-100  C, and the amount of dialdehyde is 0.01-0.06 moles per mole of formaldehyde, and condensation takes place in the presence of 0.01-0.10 moles of ammonia, hexamine, ammonium salt, aliphatic amine or diamine per mole of urea, and in stage (2) and optionally the following stages, the molar ratio of formaldehyde to urea is reduced to 2.4-1.5/1 by the addition of urea. The dialdehyde may consist of glyoxal or glutaraldehyde. The invention also relates to an amino resin produced according to the method, and to the use thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to amino resins based on 
formaldehyde, urea and aliphatic dialdehyde for making adhesives 
for cellulose-based products. The invention also relates to a 
method for producing the amino resins and to the use thereof. When gluing cellulose-based products, such as particle 
boards, fibreboards and details of solid wood, use is generally 
made of adhesives based on amino resins, primarily urea-formaldehyde 
resins. A well-known problem of these adhesives is the 
emission of free formaldehyde, both from the adhesives when they 
are produced and in their use, and from the glued products. One 
way of reducing the formaldehyde emission from amino resins is to 
reduce the molar ratio of formaldehyde/urea (F/U) as far as 
possible. A reduction of the F/U ratio in conventional urea-formaldehyde 
resins however results in a shortening of the shelf life 
of the adhesive and in a deterioration of its reactivity. To 
shorten the press times of the adhesives, the amount of hardener 
is generally increased, which also shortens the pot life of the 
adhesive mixture. Different ways of extending the shelf life of urea-formaldehyde 
resins have been suggested. Thus, for example, it is 
possible to extend the shelf life by inserting SO32- groups in 
the resin by a reaction with Na2SO3, NaHSO3. This, however, 
adversely affects the press time and the strength of the glue 
line. Co-condensation with melamine and other triazines extends 
the shelf life without reducing the water resistance, but also 
extends the curing time. Consequently, it is an object of the present invention to 
produce urea-formaldehyde resins with a low formaldehyde emission 
and good storage stability. It is a further object of the 
invention to produce a resin having an extended pot life after 
the addition of the hardener. These objects of the invention are thus achieved, as recited 
in the claims, by means of a method in which amino resins are 
produced from formaldehyde, urea and dialdehyde. In the method, 
formaldehyde, aliphatic dialdehyde and urea are condensed in two  
 
or more stages, such that in stage 
(1) the molar ratio of formaldehyde to urea is 2.6-5.0/l and 
pH 3.5-6.5 and the condensation temperature 70-100°C, and the 
amount of dialdehyde is 0.01-0.06 moles per mole of formaldehyde, 
and condensation takes place in the presence of 0.01-0.10 moles 
of ammonia, hexamine, ammonium salt, aliphatic amine or diamine 
per mole of urea, and in stage (2) and optionally the following stages, the molar ratio of 
form
