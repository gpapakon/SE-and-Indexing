<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cutting wheels.Tools containing superabrasives are widely used for cutting
extremely tough materials such as concrete for example. It
is found however that the cost of such wheels is very high
because the superabrasive component itself is very expensive.
There is therefore considerable interest in the production of
tools that are very effective and at the same time less
expensive than tools in which the superabrasive component
provides 100% of the abrasive content.One such approach is illustrated in US Patents 5,152,810 and
4,944,773 in which part of the superabrasive component is
replaced by a sol-gel alumina abrasive with surprisingly
advantageous results and a significantly lowered cost.EP-A-0 395 087 discloses cut-off wheels in which the abrasive
filament is encased in a bond system. Example V of said
document describes a resin-bonded cut-off wheel. Such a
wheel is a thin disc of uniform thickness consisting entirely
of bonded abrasive with a relatively small mounting hub at
the center. It is mentioned in said document that the
orientation of the filaments in the abrasive article is not
critical and in general there will be no dominant orientation
unless special measures are taken. Furthermore, it is
believed, in said document, that greatest efficiency will be
achieved by orienting the filaments radially so that one end
is presented at the cutting surface.The known products do not fulfil every need and they should
therefore be further improved. It is therefore the object of the present invention to
provide a cutting wheel having better characteristics than
known products. This object is solved by the cutting wheel
according to independent claim 1. Further advantageous
features, aspects and details of the invention are evident
from the dependent claims, the description and the drawings.
The claims are to be understood as a first non-limiting approach
to define the invention in general terms. The present invention provides a further advance over known
products by providing the sol-gel alumina in a form
conferring advantages in a highly efficient manner and adding
new possibilities not described in the prior art.The present invention provides a cutting wheel comprising an
abrasive tool comprising a bond material having dispersed
therein abrasive grains comprising at least one superabrasive
component and filamentary particles of a microcrystalline
alumina having an essentially uniform orientation.The filamentary particles are essentially uniformly oriented
by which is meant
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A cutting wheel comprising an abrasive tool located at the
rim of said cutting wheel, said tool comprising a bond

material being a metal bond and having dispersed therein
abrasive grains comprising at least one superabrasive

component selected from the group of diamond, cubic boron
nitride (CBN) or tungsten carbide and microcrystalline

alumina filamentary particles with a uniform orientation
wherein said filamentary particles are oriented parallel to

the cutting surface and adjacent lateral edges thereof.
The cutting wheel according to claim 1 in which the
filamentary particles incorporate finely divided particles of

an additive selected from abrasives, high temperature-stable
lubricants and grinding aids.
The cutting wheel according to claim 1 or 2 in which the
abrasive tool is in the form of segments.
