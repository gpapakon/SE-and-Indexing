<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel dye. It also 
relates to a silver halide photographic material 
containing said dye as a green sensitizing agent. Usually, silver halide photography includes the 
exposure- stage wherein silver halide is exposed to light 
to form a latent image. The latent image is developed 
during photographic processing to form a visible image. 
Originally, silver halide is sensitive to light only in 
the spectrum region of blue light. Accordingly, the use 
of spectral sensitizing dyes is demanded to enlarge the 
sensitive wavelength region of silver halide to a longer 
wavelength side. Silver halide is removed from color photographic 
materials by photographic processing in the case of 
processing color photographic materials. In the case of 
black-and-white photographic materials, unexposed silver 
halide is removed. In both cases, it is desirable that 
sensitizing dyes are also removed. Sensitizing dyes 
left behind without being removed are liable to cause a 
problem with regard to the formation of residual color,  
 
and hence the sensitizing dyes left behind have an 
adverse effect on images formed on the photographic 
materials. The problem of residual color grows more and 
more serious when the use of tabular grain emulsions and 
high chloride emulsions is increased. Tabular grains 
contained in the tabular grain emulsions have a large 
surface area per mol of silver and hence the addition 
amount of the sensitizing dyes in the grains is high. 
Accordingly, the residual color becomes high. Grains 
contained in the high chloride emulsions require the use 
of sensitizing dyes having enhanced adsorptivity to 
silver halide, and the high chloride grains are often 
subjected to rapid processing. Accordingly, there is a 
possibility that the problem of residual color becomes 
serious. Most of photographic films which require 
sensitivity to green light must be highly sensitive to 
light in the spectrum region of intermediate green light 
in the wavelength range of 540 to 555 nm (the highest 
sensitivity range to human eyes) for achieving 
sufficient sensitivity, color separation and color 
reproduction. Benzimidazolocarbocyanine, 
oxacarbocyanine and benzimidazolooxacarbocyanine dyes 
are conventional spectral sensitizing dyes which absorb 
light in the spectrum region of green light. These dyes  
 
are disclosed in, for example, Abbott et al's U.S. 
Patents 4,425,425 and 4,425,426 (reexamined No. 907), 
Ukai et al's U.S. Patent 4,510,235, Yoshida et al's U.S. 
Patent 4,801,526 and
