<ABSTRACT>
Use of an acid and a water-soluble, polymerizable film 
former, for the manufacture of a polymerizable primer for 

coating dentin, wherein the acid and the film former are 
for application sequentially, said acid being applied 

before said film former, said acid having a pK
a
 less than 
or equal to that of phenol, said acid being rinsed from 

dentin and having a calcium salt which is soluble to form 
a homogeneous solution in water, said acid having a calcium 

salt which is insoluble in said film former, said film

<DESCRIPTION>
The parent application to this divisional application 
is European Patent Application No. 87301657.0 filed on 25th 
February, 1987. Said parent application is limited by virtue of claim 
2 thereof in all designated States to use of an acid and a 
water soluble, polymerizable film former, for the 
manufacture of a primer for coating dentin, said acid 
having a pKa less than or equal to that of phenol, and said 
acid and its calcium salt(s) being soluble in said film 
former, said mixture being free of adhesively detrimental 
quantities of calcium salts that are not soluble in said 
film former. By virtue of claim 3 of said parent, which depends 
from said claim 2 of said parent, it is provided that the 
acid and the film former can be applied concurrently. 
Nevertheless there is one particularly preferred embodiment 
of the invention which is not expressly claimed in said 
parent application but which forms the subject matter of 
this divisional application. In summary, this divisional application covers uses of 
acids which are disclosed but not claimed in the parent 
application where the calcium salts of the acids are 
soluble in water but are not soluble in said film former. In recent years there has been intense interest 
in the dental field in adhesives that bond to hard tissues 
such as dentin. Many of these adhesives have been used in 
conjunction with an acid pretreatment of the dentin prior 
to application of the adhesive. A very wide variety of 
acids have been tried, with phosphoric, citric and oxalic 
acids being particularly popular pretreatments. The use of 
such acids, especially phosphoric acid, has not been 
without controversy. The American Dental Association has 
recommended against phosphoric acid pretreatment of dentin.  
 
However, phosphoric acid is extensively used as a 
pretreatment in Japan in conjunction with dentin adhesives 
from Kuraray Company, Ltd. Citric acid has a less severe 
etching effect than phosphoric acid and is used as a dentin 
pretreatment in the U.S. in conjunction with a dentin 
adhesive sold by Den-Mat Corporation. Oxalic acid also has 
a less severe etching effect than phosphoric acid, and the 
use of its monoacid and certain of its salts as a 
pretreatment is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,538,990.

dentin include M. Buonocore, W. Wileman, and F. Brudevold,
