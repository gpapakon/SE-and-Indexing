<ABSTRACT>
Telecommunication systems such as PON-FITL-Systems are known with a 
TDMA frame structure comprising a main station (2) and a number of 

substations. 
From the International Application WO 91/08623 a system is known system 

comprising means for coarse ranging and means for fine ranging the 
substations. For achieving accurate fine ranging an A/D-converter (29) 

for acquiring samples 
from a ranging pulse transmitted from the substation is 

operated at a frequency 
which is high with respect to the master or bit clock, i.e. real time 

oversampling 
occurs. Such high speed A/D-converters are expensive, consume much 

power and have 
limited resolution. Furthermore for systems with even higher bit rates 

the known 
oversampling becomes cumbersome. A quasi-oversampled coarse and/or fine 

ranging 
(28) is proposed operating at relatively low sampling rates. To this 

end the substations 
send a repetitive ranging-bit-pattern (RBP) which is sampled 

in the main station 
(2) and thereafter reconstructed with processing means (32) to a 

quasi-oversampled 
ranging-bit-pattern. For finding a ranging error to be sent to the 

relevant substation, 
the quasi-oversampled ranging-bit-pattern is matched against a 

reference pattern, 
the ranging error to be found from the best match.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a telecommunication system comprising a 
main station and a plurality of substations, in which system communication between the 
main station and the substations occurs with a predetermined bit rate via a transmission 
channel on the basis of a multiple access protocol, which channel is at least partially 
common to the substations, and in which system for the sake of ranging the substations 
comprise transmission means for transmitting ranging information to the main station 
and adjustment means for at least adjusting the timing for transmitting information to 
the main station on the basis of ranging control information received from the main 
station, and the main station comprises receiving means for receiving the ranging 
information, sampling means for taking samples from the ranging information, and 
processing means for determining the ranging control information from the samples. 
Depending on the transmission channel used, i.e. a glass fibre, a coral cable or a 
radio link, the telecommunication system can be a passive optical network (PON), a 
local area network, a satellite system or a cellular mobile radio system or the like. The present invention further relates to a main station for use in such a 
system. The present invention further relates to a substation for use in such a 
system. A telecommunication system of this kind is known from the International 
Application No. WO 91/08623, in which a TPON (Telephony on a Passive Optical 
Network) is disclosed comprising a head-end station broadcasting TDMA (Time 
Division Multiple Access) frames to a number of termination on an optical network in a 
downstream direction. In an upstream direction, each termination transmits data in a 
predetermined time slot and the data from the different terminations are assembled at 
the head-end into a TDMA frame of a predetermined format. For compensation at start-up 
or in operation of the TPON of differing delays and attenuation associated with the  
 
different distances of the various terminations from the head-end station, in the TPON 
each termination is arranged to transmit coarse and fine ranging pulses timed to arrive 
in a respective predetermined portion of the upstream TDMA frame. In Fig. 2 of WO 
91/08623 a so-called phase.1 ranging window for coarse ranging and a so-called 
phase.2 window for fine ranging within the upstream TDMA frame is shown. The head-end 
station is arranged to monitor the timing, i.e. phase, and amplitude of the arrival of 
ranging
