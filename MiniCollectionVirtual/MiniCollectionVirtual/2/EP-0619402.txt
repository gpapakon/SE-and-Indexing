<ABSTRACT>
The anchor is intended for anchor rails which are concreted into a concrete floor or the like. Such anchor rails are cut to the precise dimension on site and bear anchors which are connected fixedly to them. When the rail is installed, the overhang over the last anchor must not exceed a specific amount, it being possible for this to result in waste due to the cutting-to-size. The anchor according to the invention is to be connected in captive fashion to one end of the cut-to-length anchor rail in a simple manner, with the result that it can be subsequently fitted at any cutting point and an excessive overhang over the last anchor provided on the cut-to-length rail does not go to waste.

An anchor (1) for use with an anchor rail (2) for structural engineering
which has, in particular, a C- or U-shaped cross section,

whereby

the anchor is a bolt (5) connected to a fixing part and the fixing part

is designed as a clamp part (3) for the retro-fitting of the anchor
(1) to an end section (4) of the anchor rail (2), and
is provided with a clamp claw (6a) and a receiving part (7a),

and whereby

a slit (11) to receive the base (2') of the end section (4) of the
anchor rail (2) is provided between the clamp claw (6a) and the

receiving part (7a).
An anchor (1) for use with an anchor rail (2) for structural engineering
which has, in particular, a C- or U-shaped cross section,

whereby

the anchor is a bolt (5) connected to a fixing part and
the fixing part

is designed as a clamp part (3) for the retro-fitting of the anchor
(1) to an end section (4) of the anchor rail (2),
includes a clamp claw (6) to take an anchor rail (2), and
has a receiving part (7) which remains outside the anchor rail (2)
and which receives the bolt (5),

and whereby

the longitudinal axis of the bolt is positioned essentially vertically to
the axis (8) of the clamp claw (6).
An anchor in accordance with Claim I or 2 in combination with an
anchor rail (2),

characterised in that clamp claw (6,6a) provided for clamping in the
empty hollow section of the end section (4) of the anchor rail (2) is

matched at least approximately to the internal cross section of the
hollow section of the anchor rail (2).
An anchor in accordance with Claim 2 or 3,

characterised in that clamp claw (6) has a cross section which narrows
towards the internal section of the anchor rail (1) and in particular

tapers in a wedge shape.
An anchor in accordance with Claims 2 to 4,

characterised in that the receiving part (7) is designed as one part with
the clamp claw (6).
An anchor in accordance with Claims 2 to 5,

characterised in that the axial extension of the claw clamp (6) is at least
twice as big as that of the receiving part (7).
An anchor in accordance with Claim 5 or 6,

characterised in that the walls of the claw (6) and the receiving part (7)
taper with the same wedge angle over their whole lengths.
An anchor in accordance with Claims 5 to 7,

characterised in that the receiving part (7) has a threaded hole which is
vertical to the axis (8) of the clamp claw (6) into which the bolt is

screwed.
An anchor in accordance with Claims 5 to 8,

characterised in that the clamp part (3) which consists of the receiving
part (7) and the clamp claw (6) has a closed cross section. 
An anchor in accordance with Claim 9,

characterised in that in opposing walls of the receiving part (7)
corresponding threaded holes (9 and 9') are provided for the bolt (5).
An anchor in accordance with Claims 1 or 3,

characterised in that the clamp claw (6) has a clamping surface (6'a)
which runs at least approximately parallel to the base (2') of the anchor

rail (2).
An anchor in accordance with Claims 1 or 11,

characterised in that a receiving part (7) for the bolt (5a) is provided on
the outside of the base (2') of the anchor rail (2) and that the clamping

surface (6'a) can be tensioned against the base (2') of the anchor rail
(2) by means of the bolt (5a).
An anchor in accordance with Claims 1, 11 or 12,

characterised in that the clamp part (3) is designed as a screw clamp in
such a way that the clamp claw (6a) is connected rigidly to a receiving

part (7) for the bolt (5a) by means of a connecting part (10).
An anchor in accordance with Claim 13,

characterised in that the clamp claw (6a), receiving part (7a) and
connecting part (10) are designed as one part and that a slit (11) to

take the base (2') of the end section (4) ofthe anchor rail (2) is
provided between the clamp claw (6a) and the receiving part (7).
An anchor in accordance with Claim 14,

characterised in that the clamp claw (6a), the receiving part (7a) and the
connecting part (10) are approximately the shape of a cube or cuboid.
An anchor in accordance with Claims 13 to 15 in combination with an
anchor rail (2) with a C-shaped cross section, the legs of which delimit

an insertion slit (12),
 
characterised in that the clamp claw (6a), receiving part (7a) and

connecting part (10) are of a slightly smaller width (b) than the
insertion slit (12) on the anchor rail (2).
An anchor in accordance with Claims 2 to 7,

characterised in that the clamp claw (6) is at least approximately U-shaped
and is supported by its lateral legs (6") in the clamp position on

the curved legs (13) of the anchor rail (2) with the C-shaped cross
section, and that the bolt (5') is held in a positive connection in the base

(7') of a receiving part (7) of the clamp part (3) by means of material
deformation.
