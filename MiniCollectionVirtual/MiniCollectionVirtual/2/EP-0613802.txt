A modular distributor with a drop down shutter, with at least one channel and at least
one single action for a liquid fluid, of the type intended to be connected to conduits upstream

and downstream from a liquid fluid circuit, and of the type comprising a body (10) having at
least one unit formed by a casing (11) and a rocker (12) movable between a rest position and

an active position for causing the upstream and downstream conduits to communicate,
characterized


in that the casing (11) forms an internal cylindrical cavity (100) with a partition (111) which is
pierced through by two diametrically opposed axial holes (1110) and which is delimited by two

opposed sides (1111, 1112), whereof one (1112) is provided with two symmetrical circular
arcuate channels (101) whose concavity is directed towards the outside and which are

disposed in quadrature relative to the holes (1110), so that their ends are situated on the same
circle as the latter (1110), and with an edge (112) which has two opposed free portions

(1120), each provided with crenellations (1121) forming solid tops and hollows and which is
pierced through by two practically radial diametrically opposed tubes (1100) which each open

out in one of these two channels (101),
in that the rocker (12) forming a cylindrical block is accommodated at least partly in this cavity
(100) and has a wall (121) which is pierced through by two diametrically opposed axial

passages (1210) and which is delimited by two opposed sides (1211, 1212), whereof one
(1211) is provided with two symmetrical circular arcuate channels (102) whose concavity is

directed towards the outside, and which are disposed relative to the passages (1210) so that
each one of them partly surrounds one of these passages (1210) and so that their ends are

situated on the same circle as the passages (1210), and with a control (122),
and in that the distributor comprises, moreover,
at each end of the body (10), an end plate (20) forming a cylindrical internal cavity (200) with a 
bottom (21) which is pierced through by at least one axial opening (210) for the circulation of

the fluid and which is delimited by two opposed sides (211, 212) and with an edge (22) which
has a free portion (220) provided with crenellations (221) forming solid tops and hollows

complementary to those of the crenellations (1121) of the free end portions (1120) of the edge
(112) of the casing (11) wherewith they are intended to cooperate for engaging in one

another, so that the cavity (200) of one end plate (20) and the cavity (100) of a casing (11)
together delimit an enclosure wherein the rocker (12) can rotate,
a resilient pulling means (30) which normally keeps the rocker (12) in its rest position wherein
the tubes (1100) of a casing (11) do not communicate with the openings (210) of an end plate

(20), the openings (210), holes (1110) and passages (1210) being aligned, and against which
it is necessary to act to place the rocker (12) into an active position wherein the tubes (1100)

of a casing (11) communicate with the openings (210) of an end plate (20), the openings
(210), the channels (101, 102) of the casing (11) and of the rocker (12), and the tubes (1100)

being connected,
a sealing arrangement (40) to ensure the seal between the end plates (20), the casing (11)
and the rocker (12),
connecting means (50) for keeping the end plates (20) and the body (10) joined, and
a fixing device (60) for securing the distributor.
A distributor with a drop down shutter according to claim 1, characterized in that the
rocker (12) has a visible radial control (122) and in that the resilient pulling means (30)

comprises a spring interposed between the control (122) and the casing (11).
A distributor with a drop down shutter according to claim 2, characterized in that the
control (122) has an operating handle (1220) with a manipulating head (1221) and a

connecting foot (12, 22) which connects the head (1221) to the wall (121) and which is
pierced through by an opening (1223) wherein the spring is fitted, and in that two opposed free

portions (1120, 220) of the edges (112, 22) are each provided with a setback (1122, 22), so
as to delimit a channel wherein the connecting foot (1222) can be displaced, and a slot (1123, 

223) to delimit a recess wherein the spring (30) is fitted.
A distributor with a drop down shutter according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the sealing arrangement (40) comprises a groove (41) on at least one of the

opposed sides (1211, 1212) of the wall (121) of the rocker (12), on opposite sides (1111,
1112) of the partition (111) of the casing (11) and the internal side 
(211) of the bottom (21) of
the end plate (20) which are opposite one another, and a gasket (42) engaged in the groove

(41).
A distributor with a drop down shutter according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the connecting means (50) comprise at least one boss (51) with a recess on the

outer side (212) of the bottom (21) of each end plate (20), and a stirrup clamp (52) engaging
with two opposed bosses (51) with recesses.
A distributor with a drop down shutter according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the fixing device (60) comprises at least one tab (61) on the outer side (212) of the

bottom (21) of at least one end plate (20) and at least one hole (62) in this tab (61).
A distributor with a drop down shutter according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that the movable rocker (12) has two active positions separated by the rest position.
A distributor with a drop down shutter according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized
in that at least one of the channels (102) of the rocker (12) is surrounded by an outlet

(103).
A distributor with a drop down shutter according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized

in that it comprises at least two casing-rocker units (11, 12) and a safety device (70)

prohibiting the simultaneous manipulation of more than one rocker (12) at one time. 
A distributor with a drop down shutter according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterized
in that the tubes (1100) and openings (210) are respectively provided with connecting

means (1103; 213).
