chambers (10) and is movable to transfer the dosage 
chambers from a loading position to a discharge position 

spaced from the loading position, and/or vice versa. There 
is also a skimming unit (40) interacting with the dosage 

chambers (10) during the movement of the bottom (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a volumetric dosage
machine particularly for granulates, powders and loose
products in general, including products that are not
uniform or mutually compacted and have an extremely limited
flow ability.As is known, conventional volumetric dosage machines
are based on different operating principles, a common
characteristic of which is the provision of a dosage
chamber arranged on the bottom of the loading hopper to be
filled with the product to be metered and provided with
various systems that in succession open the chamber with
respect to the hopper while closing the bottom, close the
chamber with respect to the hopper to separate the chamber
from the overlying product, and subsequently open to
discharge the metered product.In order to perform this sequence of opening and
closing operations, usually there are gates or impeller-like
elements, a common characteristic of which is that
they often damage the product, since when the dosage
chamber is closed with respect to the hopper, a shearing
action is unavoidably applied to the product and can, in
many cases, damage it.Furthermore, another drawback of the solutions of the
known art is that in all known systems one dosage chamber
at a time is filled and emptied, consequently slowing the
production cycle.Conventional dosage machines of the type as disclosed
in the precharacterizing portion of the appended claim 1
are disclosed in US-A-3 330 311, FR-A-0 445 158, GB-A-0 982
387, and US-A-2 529 554. The aim of the present invention is to eliminate the
drawbacks described above by providing a volumetric dosage
machine particularly for granulates, powders and loose
products in general, including products that are not
uniform or mutually compacted and have a very limited flow
ability, which allows dosage without having to close the
dosage chamber, by means of gates or the like, with respect
to the hopper that contains the product being metered, thus
preventing any damage to the product.Another object of the present invention is to provide
a volumetric dosage machine which allows to perform, during
each individual operating cycle, simultaneous dosage in
multiple mutually adjacent chambers, so as to
simultaneously fill multiple containers.Another object of the present invention is to provide
a volumetric dosage machine particularly for granulates,
powders and loose products in general, including products
that are not uniform or mutually compacted and have a very
limited flow ability, which by virtue of its particular
constructive

<CLAIMS>
Volumetric dosage machine (1) particularly for
granulates, powders and loose products in general,

including products that are not uniform or mutually
compacted and have a very limited flow ability, comprising

a hopper (3) for loading a product to be metered, said
hopper being provided with a bottom (4) which has a

plurality of dosage chambers (10) and is movable to
transfer said dosage chambers from a loading position to a

discharge position spaced from said loading position,
and/or vice versa, the machine being 
characterized in that

one side of said hopper (3) is constituted by a skimming
unit (40)

which interacts with said
dosage chambers (10) during the movement of said bottom

(4).
Volumetric dosage machine according to claim 1,
characterized in that said plurality of chambers (10) is

aligned.
Volumetric dosage machine according to the
preceding claims, characterized in that said bottom (4)

moves substantially at right angles with respect to the
alignment direction of said dosage chambers (10).
Volumetric dosage machine according to one or more
of the preceding claims, characterized in that it comprises

means for the reciprocating movement of said bottom, said
means being constituted by a drive unit (20) which drives

an eccentric element (22) pivoted to one end of a link (23)
which is in turn pivoted, at its other end, to said bottom

(4), which can move along guides (24). 
Volumetric dosage machine according to one or more
of the preceding claims, characterized in that it comprises

closure gates (30) arranged at the lower opening of said
dosage chambers (10) and actuated by actuation means (31)

supported by said bottom.
Volumetric dosage machine according to one or more
of the preceding claims, characterized in that said

skimming unit (40) comprises a cylindrical frame having
a plurality of skimming paddles (41) uniformly

distributed along a circumference and connected to bars
(42) arranged substantially parallel to the rotation axis

of said cylindrical frame.
Volumetric dosage machine according to one or more
of the preceding claims, characterized in that it

comprises, in said discharge position, a plurality of
containers (16) arrangeable below said dosage chambers (10)

and supported by a conveyor (15) advancing in steps.
