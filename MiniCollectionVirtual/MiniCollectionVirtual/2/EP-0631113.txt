<ABSTRACT>
A meter for measuring air flow by resistance 
heating has a heating resistor portion (10) and four 

leads (8) for electrically connecting the resistor 
portion to a control device. A first pair of leads is 

used for supplying a current to the resistor portion 
and second pair of leads is used for measuring a 

voltage across the resistor. Accordingly errors in 
heat control due to resistances of a support, welding 

portion, wire bonding portion, etc. between a terminal 
of a sensing element and a driving circuit can be 

eliminated, to permit detection of an air flow rate 
with high accuracy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an air flow 
meter for detecting an air flow rate, and more 
particularly to a resistance heating type air flow 
meter suitable for example for measurement of an intake 
air quantity being sucked into an internal combustion 
engine. A conventional thermal type air flow meter for 
measuring an intake air quantity sucked into an 
internal combustion engine is described in JP-A-4-186123, 
for example. In this thermal type air flow 
meter, a temperature sensing resistor located in an 
auxiliary passage is electrically connected through a 
conductive support to a driving circuit provided 
outside a main passage. Further, a conventional temperature sensing 
resistor is described in JP-A-Hei 2-205721, for 
example. This temperature sensing resistor has a 
structure in which lead wires are connected to both 
ends of a sensing element. Thus, the temperature 
sensing resistor is electrically connected through the 
lead wires to an external device. In the prior art mentioned above, various 
resistor portions such as a support, welding portion  
 
and wire bonding portion are present between a terminal 
of the sensing element and the driving circuit. 
Resistance in such resistor portions is not constant, 
causing an error in measurement of a temperature of the 
sensing element or in heat control. In recent years, 
the detection of an air flow rate with a high accuracy 
has been demanded, so that the influence of the 
resistor portions present between the sensing element 
and the driving circuit is not negligible. It is accordingly an object of the present 
invention to provide a resistance heating type air flow 
meter and a temperature sensing resistor which can 
detect an air flow rate with a high accuracy. According to the first aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a resistance heating type 
air flow meter for measuring an air flow rate by using 
a heating resistor having a resistor portion and a lead 
member for electrically connecting said resistor 
portion to an external device, wherein said lead member 
comprises a first lead member for supplying a current 
to said resistor portion and a second lead member for 
measuring a voltage in said resistor portion. According to a second aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a resistance heating type 
air flow meter for measuring air flow rate by using a 
heating resistor, wherein said heating resistor has a  
 
connector portion having four terminals electrically 
connected together. By the present
