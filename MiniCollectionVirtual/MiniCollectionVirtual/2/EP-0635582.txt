<ABSTRACT>
An article such as fishing tackle or the like, is provided 
with an exterior surface which has high strength so that any 

cracking or separation hardly occurs, has high durability, 
is light in weight and is decorated to have an aesthetically 

pleasing appearance. The exterior surface is formed with 
synthetic resin coating layer, a thin decorative layer 

formed through physical vapor deposition with metal, and a 
transparent or semi-transparent protective layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an article having a
decorative metal layer.
Such a decorative metal layer may be used in sporting goods
including fishing rods, fishing reels, lures, tackle boxes,
boats, golf club shafts, golf club heads, tennis rackets,
badminton rackets, bicycle frames, and similar articles.Japanese Utility Model Unexamined Publication
No. Sho-56-117680 discloses a fishing rod in which a carbon
fiber layer is formed on the surface of a tubular body. A
layer of chromium plating is formed on top of the carbon fiber
layer so as to provide protection and a decorative,
aesthetically pleasing appearance for the fishing rod.Since the chromium plating layer directly contacts the carbon
fiber layer, the chromium plated layer is prone to electric
erosion which may cause the plating to become separated from
the carbon fiber. Additionally, since the plating layer is
comparatively thick, the weight of the rod is unnecessarily
increased, and excessive stress such as that caused by
bending of the rod during fishing, produces cracks. Further,
since the carbon fiber layer generally presents an uneven
surface, the plating layer is apt to also be uneven such 
that the decorative appearance of the plating layer is not
aesthetically pleasing.DE-A-3333381 discloses synthetic resin articles comprising,
in this order, a synthetic resin body, a two-component
polyurethane or UV-hardenable paint coating, a metal coating
having a thickness of from 2 to 30 nm, and a top coating of a
two-component polyurethane or UV-hardenable paint coating.JP-A-60-043479 relates to a resin molding for ornamentation
comprising a base layer of a resin molding of ABS, a bright hot
stamping layer of chromium or chromium alloy foil on top of the
base layer, and a paint of urethane or acrylic resin on top of
the bright hot stamping layer.JP-A-62-013565 discloses a synthetic resin molding, such as
ABS, having provided thereon, in this order, a colored base
layer consisting of polyester, a thin metallic film which is
vacuum-plated thereon, and a clear top coat film.It is an object of the present invention to provide an article having a decorative metal layer, said
decorative metal layer: 1) having sufficient strength so
as not to crack or separate from a contiguous adjacent
layer, i.e. being durable; 2) being light in weight; and 3)
providing an aesthetically pleasing appearance. The above object has been solved by providing an
article having an exterior surface which is made of
fiber-reinforced synthetic resin materials, said
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An article having an exterior surface which is made of
fiber-reinforced synthetic resin materials, said article

comprising:

an insulating synthetic resin coating layer having a
substantially smooth surface on top of the exterior

surface,
a decorative metal layer having a thickness of
several Âµm or less on top of said synthetic

resin coating layer, and
a protective layer on top of said decorative layer.
