Steam iron comprising a heating sole plate (1) having a 
vaporisation chamber (2) communicating with steam outlet orifices (3) 

formed in the said sole plate, and a casing (4) whose upper region 
forms a handle (5) whilst the lower region is fixed to the said sole 

plate, the said casing enclosing a water distribution means (6) 
connected to the said vaporisation chamber as well as a device (7) 

for adjusting a thermostat (8) which is arranged on the said sole 
plate and which comprises a display means (9) linked with a component 

(10) for operating the said thermostat and including a surface (11) 
for displaying operating modes of the iron which can be read through 

a sight glass (12) mounted in the wall of the casing, characterised 
in that the sight glass (12) has an internal face (13) which is 

juxtaposed with the display surface (11). 
Steam iron according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
internal face (13) is juxtaposed with the display surface (11) whilst 

forming a very slight clearance (ε) between them. 
Steam iron according to either one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the very slight clearance (ε) has a thickness 

of between 0.1 mm and 1 mm and preferably around 0.5 mm. 
Steam iron according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
internal face (13) is juxtaposed with the display surface (11) with 

slight rubbing between them. 
Steam iron according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that, the thermostat having a rotary control 

spindle, the component (10) for operating the thermostat (8) is a 
rotary spindle (14) extending towards the top part of the casing (4) 

and the top end (15) of which has a collar (16) transverse to the 
spindle, a peripheral annular area of which carries the display 

surface (11), the sight glass (12) having its internal face (13) 
juxtaposed with a sector of the said annular area.  

 
Steam iron according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the sight glass (12) is formed by a hollow body 

having an outer window (18) fixed to the wall of the casing (4) and 
an inner window (19) constituting the internal face (13) which is 

juxtaposed with the display surface (11). 
Steam iron according to Claim 6, characterised in that the hollow 
body forming the sight glass (12) contains air. 
Steam iron whose casing (4) has an inclined front face (4') and 
whose thermostat (8) is equipped with a display means (9) according 

to Claims 6 or 7, characterised in that the sight glass (12) is 
arranged on the front face (4') and the outer window (18) is mounted 

inclined on the said face (4'), whilst the inner window (19) is 
mounted in a plane parallel to the collar (16). 
Steam iron according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the casing (4) contains an illuminating lamp 

which is arranged in proximity to the display means (9). 
Steam iron according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the sight glass (12) is produced from a 

material which is either transparent or translucent.
