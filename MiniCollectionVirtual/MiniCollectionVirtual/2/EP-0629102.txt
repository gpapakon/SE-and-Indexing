<ABSTRACT>
A positive temperature coefficient thermistor is 
prepared from a sintered body of a ceramic material 

composition which has as a substrate BaTi0₃ with 
metallic oxide and has, in a predetermined voltage 

range, a voltage-current characteristic defined by the 
following equation: 


Vx + Iy = 
a
wherein 
a
 is a constant value, Vx is a voltage on an 
axis of abscissa and Iy is a current on an axis of 

ordinate in a cartesian coordinate, said voltage range 
extending from a predetermined value to a value at least 

twice as much as the predetermined value so that when a 
voltage in said voltage range is applied to the sintered 

body, the sintered body provides heat at a substantially 
constant value. Thus, when the present invention is 

used in countries or areas in which commercial voltages 
of 110 V and 220 V are used, almost certain temperature 

can be obtained without changing voltage by a 

transformer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an exothermic device for different 
electric source for providing constant heat regardless the voltage applied to 
the exothermal device which is used, e.g., a heat source for evaporating an 
insecticidal liquid or paste for an electric mosquito-fuge device. In a liquid-type electric mosquito-fuge apparatus as shown in Fig. 5, 
a ceramic core 3 is inserted in a tank 2 filled with an insecticidal liquid 1, 
and an exothermic device 4 is fitted on the periphery of the core 3 projected 
above the tank 2. Electricity is supplied to the exothermic device 4 for 
heating and the heat is transmitted to the core 3 to evaporate the insecticidal 
liquid 1 sucked up in the core 3, whereby diffusing the vapour of the 
insecticidal liquid in a room. The exothermic device 4 includes a positive temperature coefficient 
thermistor element 5 as the exotherm element. The positive temperature 
coefficient thermistor element has a sintered body of a ceramic composition in 
which the substrate is BaTiO₃ and metal oxides are doped in the substrate. As 
examples of the positive temperature coefficient thermistor element, there are a 
thermistor element in which electrodes are formed on both faces of a 
cylindrical body (Japanese Utility Model Publication No. Hei 1-12395) and a 
thermistor element in which electrodes are formed on both faces of an arc-shaped 
segment. The exothermic device 4 of the liquid-type electric mosquito-fuge 
apparatus is normally used by a commercial electric source of 100 V in Japan. However, the positive temperature coefficient thermistor element 
incorporated in the exothermic device has such a problem that exothermic 
temperature varies in proportion to an applied voltage. When 220 V is applied 
to the exothermic device of a general liquid-type electric mosquito-fuge  
 
apparatus, an exothermic temperature rises more than about 7°C in comparision 
with the exothermic device to which 100 V is applied. When the exothermic temperature rises more than 7 °C above a preset 
temperature, the amount of insecticidal liquid is abnormally evaporated and 
diffused faster, so that it can not be used for a predetermined effective term 
of the insecticidal liquid filled in a tank. In Japan, the voltage of the commercial electric source is unified at 
AC 100 V. Some countries use AC 220 V as the commercial electric source. 
Moreover, there are some other countries which use two kinds of voltages for 
the commercial electric source. As one example, the commercial electric sources
