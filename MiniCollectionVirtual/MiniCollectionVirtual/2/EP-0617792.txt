<CLAIMS>
A rotational speed sensor, in particular a gear wheel 
sensor, including a magnet (3) and two Hall effect elements (4, 5) 

cooperating therewith and arranged in laterally spaced relationship 
one to the other, wherein a component part made of ferromagnetic 

material, in particular a gear wheel (1), which has an irregular 
periphery or a periphery with points of discontinuity, and the 

angle of rotation (7) or rotational speed of which is to be 
determined, is movable past the Hall effect elements (4, 5) in the 

direction of the lateral distance,
characterized
 by an arrangement of a Hall IC (2) 
including the Hall effect elements, and the magnet (3) in the 

rotational speed sensor, which arrangement is displaceable in the 

direction of the lateral distance of the Hall effect elements (4, 
5). 
A rotational speed sensor as claimed in claim 1, 

characterized
 in that the Hall IC (2) is rigidly 
mounted in the rotational speed sensor, and the magnet (3) is 

slidably supported relative to the Hall IC (2). 
A rotational speed sensor as claimed in claim 2, 

characterized
 in that the magnet (3) is secured in a 
holding fixture (16), and the holding fixture is slidably supported 

in a housing (10, 11, 12) of the rotational speed sensor. 
A rotational speed sensor as claimed in claim 3, 

characterized
 by a longitudinal guide which is 
provided in the type of a groove-and-tongue joint (19, 20), the 

tongue (19) being preferably arranged on the holding fixture (16) 
of the magnet (3).  

 
A rotational speed sensor as claimed in claim 3 or claim 4, 

characterized
 in that an additional means is provided 
so that the magnet holding fixture (16), after the adjustment, can 

be fixed in position in the housing (10, 11, 12) of the rotational 
speed sensor, in particular by caulking.
