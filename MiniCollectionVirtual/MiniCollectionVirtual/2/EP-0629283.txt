<ABSTRACT>
A levelling device, in the form of a spirit level (Fig. 1), has a casing (10) with an exterior reference surface (11) and an array of five externally visible light emitting diodes (34-38), the centre diode (36) being lit, in use, when the reference surface is at a predetermined angle to the vertical or horizontal, and the diodes (34, 35; 37, 38) being lit progressively at a respective side of said central diode as the level is moved towards or away from its balance position where the reference surface is at said at least one predetermined angle, the balance position optionally also providing an audio signal. The level includes one ore more conventional bubble vials (25, 53) (Fig. 4), and though in the main embodiment these are concealed from exposure to ambient light, they are externally visible in an alternative embodiment. Supply of power automatically switches off after a predetermined time.

<DESCRIPTION>
 LEVELLING DEVICEThis invention relates to a levelling device, particularly in the form of a spirit level, and has as its object the provision thereof in a convenient and effective form.According to the invention a levelling device comprises a casing having at least one exterior reference surface, and at least one light emitting element visible externally of the casing, the arrangement being such that, in use, if the reference surface or one of the reference surfaces is placed against a surface of an object, said at least one light emitting element provides a visual indication as to whether or not said reference surface is at a predetermined angle to the vertical or horizontal.The invention will now be described, by way of example, in which:Figure 1 is a schematic, longitudinal inside view of a casing of a levelling device of the invention;Figure 2 is a schematic side view showing the arrangement of a bubble vial together with a pair of emitters and detectors forming part of a levelling device of the invention;Figure 3 is an end view of the arrangement of Figure 2;Figure 4 is an electronic circuit diagram used in one embodiment of a levelling device of the invention; andFigure 5 is a further electronic circuit diagram 

used in another embodiment of a levelling device of the invention.Figure 1 shows a levelling device of the invention which is in the form of, and is intended to be used in exactly the same ways as, a conventional spirit level. The main difference is that instead of, or in addition to external indication by the normal indicating device (the bubble in a conventional spirit level vial) the device of the invention has an electronic display consisting of an array of light emitting elements, preferably light emitting diodes.An electronic spirit level according to one embodiment of the invention is of the general form shown in Figure 1 having a generally hollow rectangular casing 10 made up of two halves, the casing being divided longitudinally. Preferably a rubber seal would be provided between the halves to make the level waterproof. As with a conventional level, the casing has a flat, longer reference surface 11 which is intended to be placed against any surface whose inclination it is wished to check. The other longer surface 12 of the casing, which constitutes the front of the level, has a central recess 13 in which are received an array of light emitting diodes 14, there being, in this example, five diodes. This front surface 12 contains a push button 15 for switching the level on. As

CLAIMS
1. A levelling device comprising a casing having at least one exterior reference surface, and at least one light emitting element visible externally of the casing, the arrangement being such that, in use, if the reference surface or one of the reference surfaces is placed against a surface of an object, said at least one light emitting element provides a visual indication as to whether or not said reference surface is at a predetermined angle to the vertical or horizontal.
2. A device as claimed in Claim 1, comprising an array of light emitting elements, a central one alone emitting light, in use, when said reference surface is at said predetermined angle.
3. A device as claimed in Claim 2, wherein as least a further light emitting element of said array, at one side of said central light emitting diode, emits light, in use, if said reference surface is not at said predetermined angle.
4. A device as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim 3, wherein a signal or signals for the operation of the light emitting elements is or are produced by passing electromagnetic radiation through a bubble vial from one side thereof and sensing the amount of electromagnetic radiation received at the opposite side thereof, the amount depending on whether it passes solely through liquid in the vial or through the bubble also, sensing means sensing said amount received producing said signal or signals.
5. A device as claimed in Claim 4, comprising two pairs of electromagnetic radiation emitters and sensors, one emitter and associated sensor being aligned axially 


of the vial and spaced axially therealong from the other emitter and associated sensor aligned axially of the vial by the axial extent of the bubble, so that when the device is at said predetermined angle to the vertical or horizontal the bubble is centrally positioned between the emitter/sensor pairs, and a balance signal is produced causing said central light emitting element alone to emit light.
6. A device as claimed in Claim 5, wherein an audio indication is produced each time the balance condition is reached.
7. A device as claimed in Claim 1, comprising a bubble vial, and means responsive to electromagnetic radiation for sensing at least one edge of the bubble of said vial, said at least one light emitting element being responsive to a signal or signals provided by the means responsive to electromagnetic radiation to provide said visual indication.
8. A device as claimed in any one of Claims 4 to Claim 7, comprising two of said bubble vials, disposed parallel and at 90Â° respectively to the or one reference surface, electromagnetic radiation being continuously passed through both vials during use of the device, with the bubble of the vial which is non-horizontal or substantially non-horizontal during such use being clear of the area of said sensing so that said signal or signals are related solely to the position of said bubble of the other vial.
9. A device as claimed in Claim 8, wherein each vial has, at one of its sides, a pair of axially spaced diodes for sensing said electromagnetic radiation, the diodes of one pair being electrically connected to the diodes of the other pair respectively in inverse parallel to 


maintain a low impedance 
.
state for said diodes.
10. A device as claimed in any one of Claims 4 to 7, wherein at least one bubble vial is disposed in said casing so as to be visible externally thereof, and means are provided so that, in use, ambient light is not sensed in the production of said signal or signals.
11. A device as claimed in Claim 10, wherein to exclude the effect of ambient light the supply of said electromagnetic radiation is pulsed on and off at a high frequency and only the pulsed output of the sensing means responsive to electromagnetic radiation is used to provide said signal or signals.
12. A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, comprising a power supply and means for supplying power to an electrical circuit of the device from said power supply.
13. A device as claimed in Claim 12, wherein the power supply automatically ceases supplying power to said circuit after a predetermined period of time.
14. A device as claimed in Claim 13, wherein the time period is set by the capacitance of a capacitor which charges when the power is initially supplied to the circuit and thereafter discharges through a resistor.
15. A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the or each light emitting element is a light emitting diode.
