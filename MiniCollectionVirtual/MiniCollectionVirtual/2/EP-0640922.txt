<ABSTRACT>
A TAG address holding circuit in a TAG block is 
provided in correspondence with each sub-arrays to hold 

the lower bits of an X address. A block control circuit 
in the TAG block judges "Hit" or "Miss" in accordance 

with the held address and a new X address in response to 
the sub-address and outputs a TAG judgement signal. A 

sub-array control circuit transfers, in response to the 
TAG judgement signal, a signal for access to the TAG 

block and a column sense amplifier. The column sense 
amplifier is utilized as a cache and data latched in the 

column sense amplifier are read out on a data buss when 
"Hit".

<DESCRIPTION>
This application claims the priority
of Japanese Patent Application No. Hei
05-216027 filed on August 31, 1993.The present invention relates to a dynamic random
access memory (hereinafter simply referred as DRAM), more
particularly, a high speed DRAM with a cache.A high speed data transmission has been realized by
incorporating a cache function into a large scale DRAM.
This kind of DRAMs incorporates on a chip a cache memory
together with a TAG memory which generates a state flag
revealing "Hit" or "Miss" of data stored in the cache
memory.A related technology employing an SRAM as the cache
memory is, for example, disclosed in "A circuit design of
intelligent CDRAM with automatic write back capability",
pp.79-80, 1990 Symposium on VLSI circuits digest of
technical papers, June 7-9, The IEEE Solid State-Circuits
Council and The Japan Society of Applied Physics,
authored by K. Arimoto et al.In the above technology, a TAG memory stores an X 
address and a Y address as a pair of TAG addresses, and
the SRAM cache stores data corresponding to the TAG
address. When the X address and the Y address are
defined in a reading operation, confirmation will be made
as to whether there exists the TAG address corresponding
to the X and Y addresses.If the TAG address is found in the TAG memory, that
is, in case of "Hit", the corresponding data are read out
from the SRAM cache with a high speed.In this manner, a high speed access can be
accomplished by incorporating the TAG memory and the SRAM
cache into the DRAM circuit. However, the above method
requires both the X address and the Y address to map data
of column sense amplifiers onto the SRAM cache. Further,
a refresh operation is performed in each of sub-arrays
constituted of memory cells so that data of the column
sense amplifiers renewed in the refresh operation are not
always to correspond to the TAG addresses in the TAG
memory. Moreover, an external X address or Y address is
directly input into the TAG memory simply through a
buffer circuit without performing a logic level
conversion processing.As described above, in case that the external
address is directly input into the TAG memory through the
buffer circuit, the TAG memory in a large scale memory
which requires stepped address decoding should be located
in front of the first decoding circuit in order to avoid 
an useless lengthy wiring.As a result, the TAG memory in a such configurated
DRAM is restricted about its layout so that the TAG
memory should be located along the X decoder.Moreover, is employed an
