<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a facsimile apparatus 
comprising a reading circuit (10, 210, 310, 610) for 

reading an image of an original, a shift arrangement 
for shifting a position of the image read by the 

reading circuit, and a transmitting arrangement for 
transmitting to another facsimile apparatus the image 

read by the reading circuit. The facsimile apparatus 
further comprises a control circuit (64, 142, 250, 

344, 446, 548, 642) for use in selecting which one 
is transmitted, the image shifted by the shifting 

arrangement or the image not being shifted, depending 
on whether one side of the original is read by the 

reading circuit or both sides thereof is read by the 
reading circuit, and depending on whether the another 

facsimile apparatus performs one side recording or 
perfect recording.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a facsimile apparatus
that records received information or read information
and files papers with recorded output printed thereon.The present invention also relates to a
facsimile apparatus that is capable of reading an
original with perfect printing and recording the
content of the original on both sides of paper.In a conventional facsimile apparatus
predetermined area of received information or read
information is recorded as it is on a recording paper.More recently, some facsimile apparatuses are
directed to record information on a cut paper
(recording pager of a standard size). Since the cut
paper is a plain paper rather than a thermal recording
paper, no copying of the received information with a
copying machine is required and it is thus favorable
by the reserving considerations. Accordingly, it is
preferable that the information printed on the plain
paper is filed as it is.However, in the conventional facsimile
apparatuses, a predetermined area of the received 
information or the read information is recorded as it
is. This means that there is less or no space
including no valid information on the left side of the
paper. In other words, there is little space left
without printing on it. To punch the left side of the
recording paper for filing may results in loss of
information.In addition, the typical conventional
facsimile apparatuses read one side of an original to
transmit the information contained therein, and
records the received information on one side of the
recording paper.Accordingly, it is necessary to read and
transmit the information by one side, requiring twice
operation to transmit whole information printed on the
both sides of the original. Such twice operation may
be acceptable but there is a disadvantage as well that
the originals are not transmitted in the order of
pages, i.e., the odd pages are transmitted first and
the even pages follow or vice verse. Further, there
is another disadvantage that the transmitted
information is recorded on one side on the paper at
the destined receiving device regardless that the
original is perfect printing or one-side printing.
Therefore, it is impossible to reproduce the
information in the form as the same as the original at the 
transmitting side at the receiving side (that is, to
record the perfect printing as the perfect output and
record the one-side printing as the one-side output). 
Furthermore, the US-A-4 831 414 discloses a copying apparatus
capable of executing a duplex-duplex copy mode, a simplex-duplex
copy

<CLAIMS>
A facsimile apparatus comprising

reading means (10, 210, 310, 610) for reading an image of
an original;
transmitting means for transmitting to another facsimile
apparatus the image read by said reading means; and
shift means for shifting a position of the image read by
said reading means;
characterized by
 further comprising
determining means (114, 116) for determining whether the
original has a binding margin; and
control means (64, 142, 250, 344, 446, 548, 642) for use
in selecting which one is transmitted, the image shifted by

said shifting means or the image not being shifted, depending
on whether one side of the original is read by said reading

means or both sides thereof are read by said reading means, and
depending on whether said another facsimile apparatus performs

one side recording or both sides recording,
 
wherein said control means makes said transmitting means

transmit either the shifted image or the image not being
shifted when it is determined by said determining means that

the original has the binding margin, and makes said
transmitting means transmit the image not being shifted when it

is determined by said determining means that the original has
no binding margin.
A facsimile apparatus according to Claim 1,

characterized in that said reading means comprises
front side reading means (110, 410, 510) for reading

a front side of the original, and back side reading
means (112, 412, 512) for reading a back side of the

original.

characterized by further comprising receiving means
for receiving from said another facsimile apparatus 

information indicating which recording is performed,
the one side recording or the perfect recording.

characterized in that said control means makes said
transmitting means transmit the image not being

shifted when both sides of the original is read and
the perfect recording is performed.
