<ABSTRACT>
A method for converting an analog signal to a digital 
floating-point number and a digital floating-point 

number to an analog signal. According to the invention, 
A/D conversion is performed by forming a logarithmed 

signal (log|x| ) from an analog signal (x) by a logarithmic 
function having an arbitrary base, converting the 

resultant signal to digital form (z) by fixed-point A/D 
conversion, separating the exponent (c) of the floating-point 

number from the digitized sample value and 
calculating the mantissa (m
q
) of the floating-point 
number from the fractional part (f) by a base 2 

exponential function. Correspondingly, D/A conversion 
is performed by converting the mantissa (m
q
) of the 
floating-point number by a logarithmic function having 

an arbitrary base to the exponent of the base, adding 
the converted mantissa and exponent, converting the 

digital number (z
2
) obtained by conversion to an analog 
signal by fixed-point D/A conversion, and forming from 

the converted signal a signal that represents its base 
2 exponent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus
for converting an analog signal to a digital floating-point
number and a digital floating-point number to an
analog signal.The use of floating-point arithmetic is rapidly
becoming more general in digital signal processing. The
reason for this is that the advantages achieved with
floating-point arithmetic over conventionally used
fixed-point arithmetic are now recognized. These advantages
include a wide dynamic range in floating-point representation
and the fact that in floating-point arithmetic,
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is used
as a measure of error, is a constant that is independent
of the level of the signal processed. The use of
floating-point arithmetic in digital signal processing
is much enhanced by the fact that efficient and sufficiently
inexpensive floating-point signal processors are
generally available. Almost all present floating-point
processors comply with the binary floating-point standard
established by the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE), which facilitates the
connection of processors with other units of digital
signal processing systems. Floating-point arithmetic or
its derivatives are now used in various applications,
e.g. in the television stereo sound standard NICAM and
the high definition television standards MAC, DigiCipher
and MUSE, in which floating-point representation is used
in transmission of audio information.The connection of a digital signal processing
system with an existing environment is implemented by
analog/digital (A/D) and digital/analog (D/A) converters. 
Conventionally, A/D and D/A converters are
implemented by fixed-point arithmetic, in which the
quantization steps are of a constant magnitude. Converters
implemented by fixed-point arithmetic are nowadays
relatively inexpensive and generally available.
However, the performance and properties of fixed-point
converters are not completely suitable for all applications
of signal processing. In these applications,
better results can be obtained by using signal sampling,
in which the quantization step is not constant.By utilizing floating-point arithmetic, which
is the best known number representation with a variable
quantization step, in A/D and D/A converters, the performance
of the converters can be improved, particularly
if the dynamic range of the signal processed is great
or the relative proportion of low signal levels is
great. Thereby conversions can be performed with a great
accuracy within a dynamic range that is wide in
