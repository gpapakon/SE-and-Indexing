<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an accelerometer (50,60,80) comprising a silicon capacitive acceleration detector (1) and an electronic system (21,30,26) for measuring the capacitive imbalance of the detector, delivering an output voltage (vs) representative of the acceleration. In order to overcome the disturbances introduced by the parasitic (stray) capacitances (C1,C2) present in the detector, a compensation system (45,70) is provided which injects a correction signal (vc,I) into the measuring system, which correction signal (vc,I) is determined so that the output voltage (vs) of the accelerometer is substantially proportional to the ratio of the difference to the sum of the capacitances of the capacitors (Cs,Ci) of the detector.
