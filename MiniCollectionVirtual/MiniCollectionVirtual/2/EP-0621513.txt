<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toner,
particularly a negatively chargeable toner, for
developing electrostatic images in image forming
methods, such as electrophotography, and electrostatic
printing. The present invention also relates to a
process cartridge and an image forming apparatus
including the toner.Hitherto, a large number of electrophotographic
processes have been known, as disclosed
in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,297,691; 3,666,363; 4,071,361
and others. In these processes, an electric latent
image is formed on a photosensitive member comprising
a photoconductive material by various means, then the
latent image is developed and visualized with a toner,
and the resultant toner image is, after transferred
onto a transfer-receiving material, such as paper, as
desired, fixed by heating, pressing, heating and
pressing, etc., to obtain a copy or a print. In the
case of including the step of transferring a toner
image, a step of removing a residual toner remaining
on the photosensitive member is ordinarily also
included.Known developing methods for visualizing 
electrical latent images with a toner may include,
e.g., the magnetic brush method described in U.S.
Patent No. 2,874,063, the cascade developing method
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,618,552, the powder
cloud method disclosed U.S. Patent No. 2,221,776, and
a method using an electroconductive magnetic toner
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,909,258.The toners used in the above developing
methods generally comprise fine powder comprising a
dye or pigment dispersed in a natural or synthetic
resin. An example of such toners comprises toner
particles in the form of pulverized fine particles on
the order of 1 - 30 µm each comprising a binder resin,
such as polystyrene, and a colorant dispersed therein.
There is also used a magnetic toner containing
magnetic particles, such as magnetite powder. In the
system of using a two-component type developer, a
toner is used in the form of a mixture with carrier
particles, such as glass beads, iron powder or ferrite
powder.Such a toner may generally contain a charge
control agent for controlling the chargeability of the
toner. In order to provide a toner with a negative
chargeability, a chromium complex compound has been
principally used.As is described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Application (JP-A) 60-170864, a chromium complex 
compound has a low dispersibility in a binder resin.
As a result, there is a tendency that coarse particles
and finer particles after a pulverization step for
toner production contain
