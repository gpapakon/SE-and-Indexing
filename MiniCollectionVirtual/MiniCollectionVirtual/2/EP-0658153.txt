<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the neutralization and controlled recovery of environmentally harmful or polluting manure gases and sewage gases which are released during wet-composting of manure from domestic animals, sewage mud, or similar masses. It also relates to the return of such released gases to ready composted manure, sewage mud or similar mass in order to produce an improved fertilizer. To this end, manure gas (5) or sewage gas released during the wet-composting process is atomized and conducted into ready-composted manure (7) or sewage mud. In a wet-composting plant for carrying out this method, a first basin (1) (the fermentation basin) is sealed so as to be gas-tight. In this basin, the gas space above the manure (3), sewage mud or similar mass communicates with a second basin (6) containing ready-composted manure (7), sewage mud or similar mass. Thus, manure gas or sewage gas is conducted into the mass in the second basin where it is atomized and mixed into ready-composted manure, sewage mud or similar mass.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of neutralizing
and recovering of gases released from wet composting of
domestic animal manure and/or sewage mud. The invention
aims at partly to render harmless, toxic and/or polluting
manure gases and sewage gases and similar by preventing
respectively reducing their concentrated outlet into the
atmosphere, partly to return the gas to a finished
composted mass for increasing the nourishing value thereof
as manure.Thus, composted sewage mud and similar masses are in this
connection called manure and are used as such.WO-A1-9 000 162 deals with a composting apparatus for
organic waste in which gases discharged from the composting
mass are passed through a bio filter. The bio filter
comprises loose bio-mass, which comprises composted
material and an added microbe stock. Part of the bio filter
material is displaced by means of a common rotor/mixer
arrangement, to a lower coaxially arranged composting unit
during compostation. Thus, the bio filter mass serves both
as a filter and as a microbe inoculator for the composting
mass in the composting unit.WO-A1-8 807 507 discloses a process for aerobic fermentive
hydrolyses, in particular for composting organic materials,
in a closed container in which fresh air is fed into the 
organic materials. The presence of noxious substances, in
particular unpleasant odours in the warm moisture-laden
outgoing air, is prevented by use of a fermentation
container closed on all sides and by the provision of a
heat-exchanger, in which the heat in the outgoing air is
absorbed by e heat-transfer medium in order to condense the
moisture in the outgoing air. The cool and dried off-gas
can be passed through an absorption filter bed of composted
and/or active coal.DE-B2-25 58 255 discloses a method of continuously
composting organic waste and/or clearing sludge which as a
heap is passed through a closed aeration reactor from its
top to its bottom while the total air necessary for the
composting process flows counterwise to the heap finely
dispersed over the total cross-section thereof from its
bottom, which aeration air optionally is humidified with
water, while the off-gas leaving the aeration reactor is
passed through a clarifying water tank in order to free it
from spores, conidia and malodorous substances.Manuring with composted manure, sewage mud or similar
masses admixed manure gases respectively sewage gases and
the like will reduce the need for artificial fertilizer in
a not inconsiderable degree.Manure gas and sewage gas are

<CLAIMS>
A method of neutralizing and recovering of gases released
from wet composting of domestic animal manure and/or sewage

mud, 
characterized
 in that wet manure stemming
from domestic animal manure and/or sewage mud is aerobically

fermented by a wet composting process involving air admixture
during vigorous stirring of the wet manure in a first gas-tightly

closed basin and conducting the manure or sewage gas
released thereby into a second basin containing finished or

substantially finished composted manure stemming from a
previous wet composting process of wet manure in the first

basin, said released manure or sewage gases being mixed into
the thus composted wet manure by a manure stirring and gas

injection process, thus producing a fertilizer and soil
amelioration agent in the form of a finished or substantially

finished composted wet manure containing finely dispersed
manure and/or sewage gases retained therein.
A methoxy according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that the manure and/or sewage gases released during the
wet composting process of the wet manure are mixed into the

finished or substantially finished composted wet manure by
means of a separate gas injection means and a separate

stirrer for putting the same manure into motion.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that the manure and/or sewage gases released during the
wet composting process of the wet manure are mixed into the

finished or substantially finished composted wet manure by
means of a submerged injector having a supply pipe for the

manure and/or sewage gases and providing for both the
injection of the supplied gases into the composted manure and

for the stirring of the composted manure. 
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that the second basin is gas-tightly closed and that the
top space thereof serving as gas space communicates with a

third basin containing water or other liquid for receiving
any residual manure and/or sewage gas released from the

composted manure in the second basin.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that any residual and/or sewage gas released from the
composted manure in the second basin is passed into the

liquid of the third basin via a pipe communicating with the
top gas space of the second basin at one end and connected

with an injector at the other end, said injector being
submerged in the liquid in the third basin.
