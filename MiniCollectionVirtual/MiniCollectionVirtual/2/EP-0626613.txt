<ABSTRACT>
An enclosure (20) useful in enclosing a dental X-ray 
film pack upon taking an X-ray picture of a tooth 

is formed of an enclosing portion (21) and a holding 
portion (22) extending from the enclosing portion. To 

permit enclosure of a dental X-ray film pack (1) provided 
with a bite block (8), the enclosing portion (21) 

is formed of two separate sheets (20a,20b). After inserting 
the bite block (8) into a basal part of the 

holding portion (22), the pack (1) is covered between 
the two sheets and the two sheets are then fusion-bonded 

to seal the pack (1) within the enclosing portion 
(21). The holding portion (22) has a length sufficient 

to extend out of an oral cavity when the enclosing 
portion is inserted in the oral cavity. After 

taking the X-ray picture of the tooth, the dentist 
holds the enclosure (20) at the holding portion (22), 

takes the enclosing portion (21) out of the cavity, and 
then tears off the enclosure (20) from a side of the 

holding portion (22), so that the dental X-ray film 
pack (1) falls out of the enclosure (20). The dentist 

is therefore free from the potential danger that the 
patient's saliva may stick to him.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for enclosing 
a dental X-ray film pack useful in X-ray photography of 
a tooth upon dental diagnosis or treatment and an enclosure 
therefor. To perform X-ray photography of a tooth, there is 
employed a dental X-ray film pack which comprises an X-ray-transmitting 
but light-tight packaging member and 
an X-ray film enclosed within the packaging member. 
Such a dental X-ray film pack will next be described 
with reference to drawings. FIG. 1 is a plan view of the dental X-ray film 
pack. In the drawing, numeral 1 is a packaging member 
made of an opaque flexible sheet so that the packaging 
member transmits X-rays but shields light. Designated 
at numeral 2 is an X-ray film sealed within the packaging 
member 1. Upon X-ray photography of a tooth of a patient, a 
dentist inserts the dental X-ray film pack into the 
oral cavity of the patient, holds the dental X-ray film  
 
pack in contact with the desired tooth and irradiates 
X-rays from an opposite side of the dental X-ray film 
pack. As a result, an X-ray latent image of the tooth 
is obtained on the X-ray film 2. The dentist takes the 
dental X-ray film pack out of the oral cavity of the 
patient, opens the packaging member 1 in a dark room or 
a dark box to take the X-ray film 2 out of the packaging 
member 1, and conducts development of the X-ray 
film 2. In this manner, an X-ray picture of the 
desired tooth can be obtained on the X-ray film 2. The 
dentist conducts a diagnosis or a treatment based on 
the X-ray picture. When conducting X-ray photography, a dentist performs 
procedures including insertion of a dental X-ray 
film pack into the oral cavity of a patient, its 
removal from the oral cavity, and opening of the packaging 
member 1 to take the X-ray film 2 out for its development. 
It is therefore impossible to avoid sticking 
of the patient's saliva, which has been adhered a 
lot on the dental X-ray film pack, to the dentist. Such sticking of saliva not only gives unpleasant 
feeling to the dentist but also has the potential 
danger that, when the dentist has a wound at a finger 
or the like, a virus in the saliva may penetrate 
through the wound and the dentist may be afflicted  
 
with a disease. To prevent the above danger, the applicant has 
already proposed an envelope for enclosing a dental X-ray 
film pack (see European Patent No. 0 316 520, the 
mention of grant of which was published on May 13, 
1992). This envelope will next be described with 
reference to some drawings. FIG. 2 is a front

cavity, characterized in that said method comprises: 
   providing an enclosure (20;40) for the dental X-ray 

film pack, said enclosure having an enclosing portion 
(21;41) formed of flexible sheets (20a,20b; 

40a,40b) and adapted to enclose said dental X-ray film 
pack therein and a holding portion (22;42) formed integrally 

and in continuation with said enclosing portion 
and having a length sufficient to extend out of 

the oral cavity when said enclosing portion is inserted 
in the oral cavity; and 

   enclosing said dental X-ray film pack (1) within 
said enclosing portion (21;41) with said bitten support 

portion (8) inserted a part of in said holding portion 
(22;42), said part continuing from said enclosing portion; 

and 
   sealing said enclosing portion (21;41).
