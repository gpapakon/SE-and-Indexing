<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
sterilizable radionuclide generator and to a method for 
sterilizing the same. United States Patent 
3,576,998 (Deutsch et al.) and United States Patent 3,774,035 
(Litt) 
relate to the generation of daughter radionuclide from a 
relatively longer lived parent radionuclide. The radionuclide 
generator disclosed in each of these patents comprises a 
column containing a relatively long lived parent radionuclide. 
The long lived parent radionuclide is spontaneously decayable 
into a short lived daughter radionuclide. The column includes 
an inlet port and an outlet port that are respectively accessible 
through appropriate respective inlet and outlet connection 
means. In use, the short lived daughter radionuclide is 
selectively removable from the column by passing an eluant 
liquid through the column. A container of eluant liquid is 
mounted to the inlet connection means while a receptacle, 
typically an evacuated vial, for receiving the resulting eluate is 
directly mounted to the outlet connection means. As the eluant 
passes through the column daughter radionuclide is drawn into 
the collection vial. The manufacture of the radionuclide generator is 
performed under controlled conditions. The column outlet 
includes a bacterial retentive filter to assure the sterility of the  
 
generator eluate. Such a radionuclide generator with a removable inlet 
plug and with a removable outlet cap is described in US-A-3 
920 995. The outlet means comprise a filter which is 
located in the outlet line and serves to insure that the 
eluate coming from the generator will be sterile and 
particle free. The filter is provided upstream from the 
outlet of the needle so that a part of the outlet needle 
is located downstream of the filter. Therefore, the 
outer part of the needle is susceptible to contamination 
from outside. After sterilization of the used generator, 
the filter does not protect the outside part of the 
needle against contamination. It is an object of invention to provide a radionuclide 
generator with an improved sterility. This object is achieved, according to the invention, 
with the features of claim 1 or 7.  
 The present invention relates to a radionuclide generator 
of the type having a column having a long lived parent 
radionuclide and a relatively short lived daughter radionuclide 
therein. The column has an inlet port and an outlet port with 
means provided for connecting the inlet port of the column to a 
source of eluant and means provided for connecting
