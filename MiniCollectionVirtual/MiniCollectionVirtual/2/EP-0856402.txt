<ABSTRACT>
A method for detecting image position errors, includes forming a
first pattern (10) with a symbol embedded therein and a second pattern (20)

which, when superpositioned on the first pattern, exposes the symbol
if the misalignment between the first and second patterns exceeds a

position error tolerance. The symbol is perceivable with the
unaided eye even if the misalignment is imperceivable to the unaided

eye.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to position sensitive imaging and
more particularly to a technique for providing enhanced detection of
image position errors.Modern electronic prepress, offset and other types of printing
operations write or record images for subsequent reproduction or
read a prerecorded image at a predefined resolution rate. Such
systems may write or record images or in the case of prepress
systems, read prerecorded images on various media including, photo
or thermal sensitive paper or polymer films, photo or thermal
sensitive coatings, erasable imaging materials or ink receptive
media mounted onto an image recording surface, or photo or thermal
sensitive paper, polymer film or aluminum base printing plate
materials, all used in image reproduction. Such media are mounted
onto a recording surface which may be planar or curved.In the case of prepress systems, the primary components include
a recording surface, usually a drum cylinder and a scan mechanism
disposed and movable within the drum cylinder. The system also
includes a processor, with an associated storage device, for
controlling the scanning mechanism. The processor and associated
storage device may be housed within the system itself or separate
from the system with appropriate interconnection to the system. The
processor, in accordance with stored programming instructions,
controls the scanning mechanism to write or read images on the
medium mounted to the inner drum cylinder wall by scanning one or
more optical beams over the inside circumference of the drum
cylinder while the drum cylinder itself remains fixed.The scanning and hence the recording are performed over only a
portion of the cylinder inner circumference, typically between 120°
and 320° of the circumference of the drum cylinder. The optical
beam(s) are typically emitted so as to be parallel with a central
axis of the cylinder and are deflected, by for example, a spinning
mirror, Hologon or Penta-prism deflector so as to form a single scan 
line or multiple scan lines which simultaneously impinge upon the
recording surface. The deflector is spun or rotated by a motor
about an axis of rotation substantially coincident with the central
axis of the drum cylinder. To increase the recording speed, the
5 speed of rotation of the beam deflecting device can be increased.Notwithstanding the type of system, whether prepress, offset
printing or otherwise, being utilized, it is of primary importance
that the images be recorded as close as possible to a desired
location to ensure
