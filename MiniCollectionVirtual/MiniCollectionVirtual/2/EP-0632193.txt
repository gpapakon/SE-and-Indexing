<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a fault diagnosis apparatus 
for a vehicle control system. The fault diagnosis 

apparatus is useful in diagnosing a fault of an 
electronic component mounted on a vehicle, especially 

when the fault has led to such a control as deteriorating 
exhaust gas. It is an object of this invention to 

minimize an increase in the manufacturing cost upon incorporation 
of such a fault diagnosis apparatus. According 

to this invention, the vehicle control system 
has an automatic transmission operation state detection 

sensor (11), an engine operation state detection sensor 
(1), an automatic transmission control unit (12) and an 

engine control unit (2). For the diagnosis of a fault 
of at least one of the sensors (11,1) and control units 

(12,2), the fault diagnosis apparatus comprises a fault 
determining unit (13), a code converter (14), a fault 

determining unit (3), a code converter (4), an ISO converter 
(5) and a determining and diagnosing tester (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fault diagnosis apparatus
and method for a vehicle control system. The
fault diagnosis apparatus and method are useful in
diagnosing a fault of an electronic component mounted
on a vehicle, especially when the fault has led to such
a control as deteriorating exhaust gas.It has been the common practice to electronically
control the operations of an engine, an automatic
transmission (which may hereinafter be abbreviated as
"AT") and the like, which are mounted on a vehicle.
Their control is however performed based on outputs
from plural sensors, resulting in the inconvenience
that appropriate control would no longer be feasible if
one or more of the sensors fail. To cope with this inconvenience,
each automobile maker has adopted its own
fault diagnosis method, thereby detecting a fault of a
sensor and outputting its own sensor fault signal to
its own diagnosis system.In the meantime, regulations on the emission control 
(the so-called "OBD-II") have been introduced
recently in the United States. Under the regulations,
it is required that if control of an automatic transmission
mounted on a vehicle is performed in such a way
as deteriorating the exhaust gas emitted from the
vehicle, a failed electronic component for the AT control,
said failed electronic component being responsible
for the deteriorated exhaust gas, should be
detected and also informed to the driver by turning on
an indicator lamp or the like. This applies equally to
electronic components for the control of an engine.According to the above regulations, fault signals
independently detected by individual automotive makers
are coded in accordance with the communication rules
(ISO 9141) specified by the regulations so that when a
prescribed diagnosis system is employed, each failed
electronic component can be detected as a common signal
irrespective of the maker.Now assume, for example, that a vehicle is
equipped with an engine control unit (ECU), an AT control
unit and a further control unit for other devices.
Where a fault responsible for a deterioration in exhaust
gas is detected in one of electronic components
of each control unit, it may then be thought of informing
the fault by turning on an indicator lamp as described 
above and further of coding a fault signal in
each control unit in accordance with the communication
rules prescribed above and then outputting the thus-coded
fault signal to a diagnosis system.This however requires to provide each of the control
unit with a conversion unit which can output a
cod
