<ABSTRACT>
A pelletizer for plastics of the invention has a brake 
drum disposed on a sleeve for holding a cutter drive shaft and 

a diaphragm disposed on a housing, and controls both biasing 
and axial movement of cutter knives to a die surface through 

the sleeve by controlling a pressure of the diaphragm, so that 
a longer life of the cutter knives, ensured cutting of resin, 

and use of the cutter knives made of an inexpensive material 
can be achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pelletizer according to the pre-characterising
portion of claim 1.A corresponding pelletizer is known from US-PS 5,190,768 and is illustrated in Figure
3.In Figure 3 reference numeral 1 designates a pelletizer, which is secured to a die
surface 3a side of a die 3 through a cutter case 4. The die 3 is mounted on a manifold
2 so as to be in intimate contact therewith, the manifold 2 distributing molten resin
extruded from an extruder (not shown) in the circumferential direction.The die 3 is of the disk-like shape and has many nozzles 6,6, · · · axially passing
through the die in a ring-like area encircling the center of the die 3. One end of each
nozzle 6 is opened toward a ring-like resin passage 2a of the manifold 2, and the
other end thereof is opened within the cutter case 4.One side of the cutter case 4 is releasably secured to the surface 3a side of the die 3
by bolts 7, and the pelletizer 
1 is secured to the other side thereof by bolts 53. A cooling
water inlet 8 is arranged at the lower portion of the cutter
case 4, and a cooling water outlet 9 is arranged at the upper
portion thereof, so that the cutter case 4 is filled with
cooling water at all times.In the pelletizer 1 is a sleeve 52. The sleeve 52 is
contained in a housing 15 through an O ring 50 and a plurality
of packings 51 so as to be movable by a predetermined distance
in the axial direction. Within the sleeve 52 is a cutter drive
shaft 12. The cutter drive shaft 12 is held through a pair of
shaft sealing members 54 and a pair of bearings 55 so as to be
rotatable coaxially and immovable in the axial direction
(longitudinal direction) relative to the sleeve 52.In cutter drive shaft 12, the cutter holder 10 is held
at an end portion of the cutter drive shaft 12 projecting
toward the inside of the cutter case 4 through a bolt 10a and
a key 10b so as to be rotatable integrally with the cutter
drive shaft 12 and releasable. A driving unit (not shown) is
connected to the other end of the cutter drive shaft 12 trough
a shaft coupling (not shown) that is slidable in the axial
direction.On an end surface of the cutter holder 10 confronting
the die 3 are a plurality of cutter knives 11, 11, · · · radially
held. The cutter knives 11 are located so as to confront the
die surface 3a of the die 3, i.e., the surface of the ring-like
area on which the nozzles 6, 6, · · · are arranged. A rear portion 52a of the sleeve 52 forms a piston within a rear
portion 15a of the housing 15 together with a rear cover 63
serving as
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A pelletizer (1) for plastics comprising:

a cutter holder (10) having cutter knives (11), each of the cutter knives (11) being
provided to rotate along a die surface (32) of a die (3);
a cutter drive shaft (12) for holding the cutter holder;
a sleeve (52) for internally holding the cutter drive shaft (12) so as the cutter drive
shaft be rotatable and immovable in an axial direction relative to the sleeve; and
a housing (15) for internally holding the sleeve (52) and for allowing the cutter
drive shaft (12) to move in the axial direction together with the sleeve,
characterized by
a braking unit (200) for suppressing or adjusting the axial movement of the cutter drive
shaft (12), the braking unit (200) being disposed between the sleeve (52) and the

housing.
A pelletizer for plastics as claimed in claim 1, wherein the braking unit (200)
includes:


a brake drum (67a) disposed on the sleeve (52);
a pair of holders (203a, 203b) disposed around the brake drum (67a);
a diaphragm (202) mounted on one holder (203b);
a brake shoe (201) provided on the other holder (203a) at a position
corresponding to the diaphragm (202);
a switching valve (211) for switching supply and discharge of the pressure
medium to be supplied to the diaphragm (202); and
a pressure adjusting valve (210) for adjusting a pressure medium supplied to the
diaphragm (202).
A pelletizer for plastics as claimed in claim 1, or 2 wherein a piston cylinder
(52a) is formed by making a part of the sleeve (52) serving as the piston.
