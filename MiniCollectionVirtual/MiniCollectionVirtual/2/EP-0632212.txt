<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hydraulic vibration (oscillation) damper, particularly for motor vehicles, with a piston element (1) which has two groups of passages (2,3), through each of which liquid can flow in one of two directions, with a valve (4) which interacts with one of the groups of liquid passages (2) and responds to compressive loading of the vibration damper, and with a valve (5) which interacts with the other group of liquid passages (3) and responds to tensile loading of the vibration damper. According to the invention, the piston has at least one pressure relief valve (6), which at high liquid pressures opens up at least one additional bypass through the liquid passages (2,3) through which flow does not occur in the respective direction of loading.
