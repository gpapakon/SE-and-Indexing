<ABSTRACT>
A method for rolling finished sections from a preliminary section (section blank) by means of an arrangement of roll stands which comprises a first universal stand on the entry side, a second universal stand on the exit side and an edger arranged between these universal stands. An edger is arranged ahead of the rolling group. The preliminary section comes from a continuous casting device and has, at both ends of a web, thickened portions corresponding to the subsequent finished profile. The dimensions of the preliminary section are matched in such a way to the web height, web thickness and/or flange width of the finished section to be rolled that this preliminary section is introduced directly into the first universal stand and can then be rolled to give the finished section with the specified dimensions or, to obtain different dimensions deviating from the original specification, the web-like portion and/or the flange-like thickened portions of the preliminary section are, before the preliminary section is introduced into the first universal roll stand, subjected to reduction rolling in a rolling line (W1) with a free outlet extending parallel to the rolling line (W2) of the arrangement of roll stands  (U1, SG, U2), and the preliminary section is then displaced transversely into a position directly in front of the compact rolling group (U1, SG, U2) and introduced into the latter.

Method of rolling finished profile members from a starting profile member by means
of a rolling stand arrangement which operates in reversing operation and which forms a

compact rolling group consisting of a first universal stand (U1) at the inlet side, a second
universal stand (U2) at the outlet side and an edging stand (SG) arranged between these

universal stands, wherein the starting profile member is a profile member which arrives
from continuous casting equipment and which has, at both ends of a web, reinforcements

corresponding with the later finished profile member, and the dimensions of the starting
profile member are so matched to predetermined dimensions such as web height, web

thickness and/or flange width of the finished profile member to be rolled that this starting
profile member is either introduced directly into the first universal stand (U1) of the

compact rolling group and then able to be finish-rolled down in this into the finished profile
member with the predetermined dimensions or, for attainment of other dimensions, which

differ from the original specification of web height, web thickness and/or flange width, of
the finished profile member to be finish-rolled in the compact roll group, the weblike

section and/or the flange-like reinforcements of the starting profile member are deformed
by rolling in reducing manner, before introduction of the starting profile member into the

first universal roll stand (U1) of the compact rolling group, in rolling equipment which is
arranged upstream thereof and comprises an edging stand (VG), characterised in that the

reducing deforming by rolling takes place in a rolling line (W1), which runs parallel to the
rolling line (W2) of the compact rolling group (U1, SG, U2), with a free run-out and the

starting profile member is brought, in a position directly in front of the compact rolling
group (U1, SG, U2), transversely displaced into this.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the upstream rolling equipment
consists of a vertical stand (VG), which acts on the starting profile member in the sense of

an upsetting of the weblike section of the starting profile member.
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that the vertical stand (VG) is
associated with a horizontal stand (HG), by means of which the weblike section of the

starting profile member is acted on.
Method according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that the profile member is rolled
in a vertical stand (VG) or horizontal stand (HG), which is constructed as a two-high stand, 

with smooth rolls and that the profile member strip is edged by means of an edging device.
Method according to one of claims 2 to 4, characterised in that a heating oven
(WO) arranged upstream of the first rolling line (W1) is provided behind the continuous

casting equipment and that the starting profile member hot from casting is preliminarily
deformed, especially into its flange-like reinforcements, by a horizontal rolling stand (HVG)

arranged upstream of the heating oven (WO).
