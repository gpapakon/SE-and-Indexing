<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method in the regulation 
of a multi-layer headbox and a multi-layer headbox 

for a paper machine/board machine. In the method, 
for the formation of the different layers in the web, 

in the multi-layer headbox, at least two pulp suspensions 
(M₁,M₂) of different pulp concepts are made 

to flow, said pulp suspensions forming the different 
layers in the web. The flow of a pulp suspension 

(M₂) that forms one of the layers in the web is 
regulated by regulating the component flows (Q
3.1
, 
Q
3.2
...Q
3.n
) that constitute said flow and the concentrations 
of said component flows independently 

from one another. Hereby, by means of said regulation 
applied to the particular layer, the total flow of 

the pulp suspension (M) leaving the headbox is 
regulated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention
concerns a multi-layer headbox of a paper machine or board machine according
to the preamble of claim 1, being based on EP-0 462 472.
Further relevant prior art is disclosed in DE-A-4 112 347 and GB-2 093 879.In a multi-layer headbox, pulps of different sorts in the vertical direction are fed in
the different layers. One or both of the faces of the paper or board formed out of the
jet of the headbox are made representative by using, e.g., high-cost and bleached
pulp with a high content of fillers. In a three-layer structure, the middle layer is used
to constitute the strength and rigidity of the paper/board, whereas the surface layers
hide the less expensive and coarser raw-material in the middle of the structure.In a multi-layer headbox, when the grammage is regulated conventionally by
profiling the shape of the slice, all the layers are affected at the same time, including
the covering surface layers. In such a case, the coverage by the surface material is
changed in the regulated area and leaves a striped appearance in the product. The
profile-bar construction produces turbulence in the jet and deteriorates the purity of
the layers.As is known from the prior art, the direction of the discharge jet of the pulp
suspension discharged out of the headbox should differ from the machine direction
as little as possible. A directional angle of the discharge jet that differs from the
machine direction, which produces distortion of the fibre orientation, has a clear
effect on the quality factors of the paper, such as the anisotropy of strength and
stretch. The level and variation of anisotropy in the transverse direction also affect
the printing properties of paper, such as moisture expansion. In particular, it is an 
important requirement that the main axes of the directional distribution, i.e. orientation,
of the fibre mesh in the paper coincide with the directions of the main axes of
the paper and that the orientation is symmetric in relation to these axes.At the edges of the pulp-flow duct in the headbox, of course, owing to the vertical
walls, there is a higher friction. This edge effect produces a very strong linear
distortion in the profile. Profile faults in the turbulence generator of the headbox
usually produce a non-linear distortion in the profile inside the lateral areas of the
flow ducts.Attempts are made to compensate for an unevenness of the grammage profile arising
from the drying-shrinkage of paper/board by means of a crown formation of the
slice, so that the slice is thicker in
