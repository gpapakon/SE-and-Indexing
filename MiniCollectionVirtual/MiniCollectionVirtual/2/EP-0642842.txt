use with a material dispensing head (18) including a nozzle 

engagement member (32) on a portion of the dispensing head 
(18), a nozzle member (12) having an aperture (26) therethrough 

for operable communication with the dispensing head 
(18) to provide dispensing of the material in a predetermined 

pattern, and a connecting member (42, 44, 46) 
integral with the nozzle member (12) for engagement with 

the engagement member (32) of the dispensing head (18). 
The connecting member (32, 42, 44, 46) is operable by hand 

and provides quick release and connection of the nozzle

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to material 
dispensing systems, and more particularly to a quick 
release and connect nozzle assembly for use with a modular 
adhesive dispensing head in which the nozzle assembly 
readily can be disconnected from and connected to the 
dispensing head by hand to enable changing of nozzles to 
provide a different pattern or for enabling cleaning. Material dispensing systems, such as those utilized 
for dispensing hot-melt adhesives, are typically air activated 
and include a modular dispensing head which enables 
adhesives to be dispensed in precise quantities and 
patterns. An example of such a dispensing head is generally 
illustrated in U.S, Patent No. 5,121,930. As FIG. 2 of that patent illustrates, the bottom of 
the dispensing head includes an apertured nozzle in the 
form of a nut which is threaded onto threads formed on the 
dispensing head. If the nozzle becomes clogged or a 
different nozzle is desired, a hand-tool must be utilized 
to unthread the nozzle from the dispensing head. The hand-tool, however, can be difficult to manoeuvre 
due to the close quarters of the dispensing system and 
the nozzle can fall into other portions of the equipment 
and be lost and/or cause jamming of the equipment. 
Additionally, due to the heat generated in such nozzles 
from operation of the system, an operator can be burned if 
not careful. It therefore would be desirable to provide a nozzle 
assembly which readily can be disconnected from and 
connected to the dispensing head and which does not require 
the use of hand-tools. According to a first aspect of this invention a nozzle 
assembly for quickly connecting and releasing a nozzle 
member to and from a material dispensing head; comprises:
 
   engagement means, comprising a pair of diametrically 
opposed, radially projecting pins having a pre-determined  
 
axial thickness, disposed upon said dispensing head or 
said nozzle member;
 
   said nozzle member having an aperture defined therethrough 
for operable communication with said dispensing 
head to provide dispensing of material in a pre-determined 
pattern; and,
 
   connecting means integral with the other one of said 
dispensing head or nozzle member for engagement with said 
projecting pins and comprising a pair of diametrically 
opposed entry slots defined at a first axial entrance 
position, a pair of diametrically opposed terminal end 
channels defined at a second axial position which is 
axially spaced from said first axial position, and a pair 
of

a pre-determined pattern; and, 
   connecting means (42, 44, 46) integral with the other 

one of said dispensing head (18) or nozzle member (12) for 
engagement with said projecting pins (32) and comprising a 

pair of diametrically opposed entry slots (42) defined at 
a first axial entrance position, a pair of diametrically 

opposed terminal end channels (46) defined at a second 
axial position which is axially spaced from said first 

axial position, and a pair of diametrically opposed, 
semi-circular tracks (44), defined upon interior 

peripheral wall surfaces of said other one of said 
dispensing head (18) or nozzle member (12) and interconnecting 

said pair of diametrically opposed entry slots 
(42) defined at said first axial entrance position and said 

pair of diametrically opposed terminal end channels (46) 
defined at said second axial position; said diametrically 

opposed entry slots (42) having a pre-determined axial 
depth which is substantially equal to said pre-determined 

axial thickness of said diametrically opposed, radially 
projecting pins (32) such that upon insertion of said 

diametrically opposed radially projecting pins (32) into 
said entry slots (46) immediate rotation of said nozzle 

member (12) relative to said dispensing head (18) causes 
said nozzle member (12) to be axially translated toward 

said dispensing head (18) as a result of said diametrically 
 

opposed projecting pins (32) moving circumferentially

entrance position (42) to said second axial terminal 
position (46).
