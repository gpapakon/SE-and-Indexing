<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to pneumatic tyres, in particular pneumatic motor vehicle tyres (20) which have a carcass which is provided with reinforcements and radially internal beads (22) and a profiled tread (23) which is fitted onto the carcass, an additional layer (25) which reinforces the profile edges (27) being applied to the tread (23). In order to improve effectively the driving properties, in particular the grip, of the pneumatic tyres, it is proposed to stabilise the profile blocks (26) in that the additional layer (25) is formed from rubber or thermoplast, has a higher modulus of stretching strain than the tread (23) below it and contains reinforcement members.

Pneumatic tyre, more especially a pneumatic 
automotive vehicle tyre, which has a carcase, which is 

provided with reinforcements and radially internal beads, 
and a profiled tread strip which is placed upon the 

carcase, an additional layer being applied to the tread 
strip and reinforcing the profile, characterised in that 

the additional layer is formed from rubber or thermoplastic 
material, it has a higher modulus of tensile deformation 

than the tread strip situated therebeneath, and it contains 
unexpanded reinforcing members, and in that the additional 

layer is situated on at least the side walls of the profile 
blocks. 
Pneumatic tyre according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the profile-reinforcing additional layer has 

between 0.05- and 0.3-times the thickness of the tread 
strip. 
Pneumatic tyre according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the material of the tread strip is porous. 
Pneumatic tyre according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the additional layer contains reinforcing members 

in the form of organic and/or inorganic, heat-resistant, 
deformable, fibre-like, filament-like or wire-like 

structures or portions of such structures. 
Pneumatic tyre according to claim 1 or 4, 
characterised in that the length of the reinforcing members 

is between 0.25- and 5-times the profile depth. 
Pneumatic tyre according to claim 1 or 4, 
characterised in that the reinforcing members are 

compressed in the unvulcanised additional layer and/or are  
 

placed in a zigzag manner and/or are in a random 
orientation. 
Pneumatic tyre according to claim 1 or 4, 
characterised in that the reinforcing members are applied 

to the rubber core by winding fibre-like, filament-like or 
wire-like structures round an unvulcanised rubber core. 
Pneumatic tyre according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the additional layer contains 

inorganic particles such as corundum particles and/or 
silicon dioxide particles and/or glass particles. 
Pneumatic tyre according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the additional layer on the contact 

surfaces of the profile is removed. 
Method of producing a profile-reinforcing 
additional layer for pneumatic tyres according to one or 

more of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that reinforcing 
members are introduced between thermoplastic layers or 

unvulcanised rubber layers. 
Method according to claim 10, characterised in that 
the reinforcing members are introduced in a zigzag 

disposition between thermoplastic layers or unvulcanised 
rubber layers. 
Method according to claim 11, characterised in that 
reinforcing members are embedded between two unvulcanised 

rubber layers, which enter a roller nip, by means of a 
guide arrangement, which is moved to and fro and/or up and 

down, on a calender so that a zigzag disposition is 
produced. 
Method according to claim 10, characterised in that 
the additional layer between two toothed rollers is brought  

 
into a zigzag disposition and/or folded and compressed by 

the action of force of rollers which rotate at different 
speeds. 
Method according to claim 10, characterised in that 
the reinforcing members are introduced in random 

orientation between thermoplastic layers or unvulcanised 
rubber layers. 
Method according to claim 10, characterised in that 
the reinforcing members are mixed into the additional 

layer. 
Method of producing a profile-reinforcing 
additional layer for a pneumatic tyre according to one of 

claims 1 to 9, characterised in that reinforcing members 
are wound round an unvulcanised rubber core, and this 

composite structure is applied to the tread strip of an 
unvulcanised tyre blank.
