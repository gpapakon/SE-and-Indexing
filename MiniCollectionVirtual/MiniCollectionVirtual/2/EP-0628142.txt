<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an attachment for securing an end-part of a toothed belt-element (12, 14) to a machine element (10). The machine element (10) has a slot (18, 16) for receiving an end-part of the belt-element. Arranged on at least one of the opposing walls of the slot is at least one gripping bar (22, 28) which projects into the slot and the cross-sectional shape of which corresponds generally to the cross-sectional shape of a tooth-space formed recess (24, 30) in the end-part (14a, 12a) of the belt element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for fastening 
one end-part of at least one toothed belt-element to a 
machine element which has at least one slot through 
which one end-part of the belt-element is intended to be 
inserted and secured and the distance between the walls 
of which slot correspond generally to the thickness of 
the belt-element. Such a device is known from the 
pior art. When fastening toothed belt-elements to a machine part, 
for instance to a slide which is intended to movably 
support a read head in printing equipment, the end-part 
of the belt-element has previously been secured to the 
slide by passing said end through a slot and then securing 
said end with the aid of a screw which is inserted 
through the slot and through a hole in the belt-element 
and then screwed into a threaded hole in the slide. This 
belt-securing technique requires the provision of a hole 
in the end of the belt and also the provision of a 
screw-threaded hole in the slide, and also requires 
manual tightening of the fastener screw. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
simpler and quicker method of securing a toothed belt-element 
to a machine element without requiring the 
provision of additional fastener elements. This object is achieved with a belt attachment device of 
the aforedescribed kind which is characterized in that 
at least one of the opposing walls of the slot has at 
least one gripping bar which projects into the slot and 
the cross-sectional shape of which corresponds generally 
to the cross-sectional shape of a tooth-space formed 
recess in the end-part of the belt-element. A slot of 
this configuration will enable the end-part of the  
 
toothed belt-element to be readily inserted into the 
slot from either side thereof, i.e. transversely to the 
length direction of the belt-element, such that the 
gripping bar or bars will be placed in or inserted in 
tooth-space formed recesses between the projections on 
the end-part of the belt-element, said projections 
having the form of rack teeth, so as to obtain a clamping 
fit between the belt-end and the slot walls. In this 
regard, at least one wall of the slot is conveniently 
formed by one side wall of a tongue-like leg which is 
configured to exert on the end-part of the belt-element 
inserted in the slot a clamping force directed which 
acts in a direction towards the other side of the slot. 
Furthermore, it is preferred that several gripping bars 
are disposed on the slot wall at a mutual distance apart 
which

<CLAIMS>
A device for attaching an end-part (12a, 14a) of at 
least one toothed belt-element (12, 14) to a machine 

element (10) which has at least one slot (16, 18) in 
which the end-part (12a, 14a) of the belt-element is 

intended to be inserted and secured, and where the 
distance between the slot walls generally corresponds to 

the thickness of the belt-element, 
characterized
 
in that at least one of the opposing 

walls of the slot (16, 18) includes at least one gripping 
bar (22, 28) which projects into the slot and the 

cross-sectional shape of which corresponds generally to 
the cross-sectional shape of a tooth-space formed recess 

(24, 30) in the belt-element end-part (14a and 12a 
respectively). 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that at least one wall of the slot 

(16, 18) forms one side-wall of a tongue-like leg 
(20, 32) which is configured to exert on the end-part of 

the belt-element inserted in said slot a clamping force 
which acts in a direction towards the other side of the 

slot. 
A device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that several gripping bars (22, 28) 

are disposed on the slot wall at a mutual spacing which 
corresponds to the pitch or division of the tooth spaces 

(24 and 30 respectively) on the belt-element (14 and 12 
respectively).  

 
A device according to any one of Claims 1-3, 

characterized
 in that the slot (18) includes 
abutment means (34) which function to limit 

lateral movement of the belt-element (12) in said 
device.
