<ABSTRACT>
In order to reduce the production complexity and the production costs, the water jet cutting basin (1) for a water jet cutting system, which is equipped with supporting elements (3, 4) for receiving a workpiece-depositing means and the actual cutting device, with a discharge (6) for the cutting water and with a cutting-basin floor inclined in the direction of the cutting-water discharge (6), is produced from, in particular, highly compacted vibrated concrete, preferably with steel reinforcements (2). Consequently, the basin (1), together with all the associated connections, can be produced in a single operation without any follow-up work such that it is suitable and ready for operation.
