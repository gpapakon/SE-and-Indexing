<ABSTRACT>
A method for preparing a substrate having a light-shielding 
layer involves forming a photosensitive coating film 

on a transparent electrically conductive layer formed on a 
transparent substrate, exposing the photosensitive coating 

film via a mask exhibiting light transmitting properties, 
removing and developing the coating film for exposing the 

transparent electrically conductive layer and 
electrodepositing a dark-hued coating on the exposed 

transparent electrically conductive layer for forming the 
light-shielding layer, and heating the light-shielding layer. 

The substrate having the light-shielding layer has a volume 
resistivity of 1 × 10² ohm·cm or higher and may be used for a 

counterelectrode substrate for a TFT array substrate 
incorporated in a liquid crystal display device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for forming a
substrate having high definition and high light-shielding
capability. More particularly, it relates to a method for
forming a substrate which has a light-shielding layer and
which may be utilized for preparing a color filter employed in
particular for a liquid crystal display device, and to the use of a
substrate having the light-shielding layer as
a counterelectrode
substrate for a thin film transistor (referred to as TFT)
array substrate for black and white display or as a substrate for a color filter for a liquid crystal display device which are superior
in high definition and light-shielding capability and which
may be prepared by a simple process.As a typical example of the color liquid crystal
display device, there has hitherto been known a TFT (thin film
transistor) - active matrix color liquid crystal device. The
device includes a substrate arranged on an inner polarizing
plate, a thin film transistor (TFT) and a pixel electrode
driven by the TFT arranged on the substrate, and an inner
alignment layer contacted with both the TFT and the pixel
electrode. On its outer side, the device includes a liquid
crystal layer having an outer alignment layer and an outer 
polarizing plate arranged on the outermost side. Between the
outer alignment layer and the outer polarizing plate, there is
mounted a color filter having a black light-shielding layer
(black matrix) and colored layers, such as red-hued layer,
green-hued layer and blue-hued layer on a transparent
electrically conductive layer formed on the transparent
substrate. For producing the color filter, there are
currently proposed a dyeing method, a dye-pigment dispersion
method, a printing method, an electrodeposition method and a
transfer method. With any of these known methods, the
precision in the arraying of the respective colored layers,
such as red-hued, green-hued and blue-hued layers, herein
occasionally abbreviated to R, G, B and BL layers,
respectively, is of utmost importance. Above all, the black-hued
layer, that is the light-shielding layer, needs to be
positioned not only in registry with the counterelectrode
substrate to avoid light leakage in the vicinity of the pixel
electrode but also without voids between the other colored
layers and the light-shielding layer significantly influences
the picture quality such as contrast. Consequently, the
current practice is to produce the light-shielding layer with
high precision and to form other colored layers so as to be
overlapped to some
