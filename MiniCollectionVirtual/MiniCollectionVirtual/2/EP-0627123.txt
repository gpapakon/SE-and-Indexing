<ABSTRACT>
An improved method of making masks includes forming a layer of amorphous silicon (12) of about 2,000 angstroms on a transparent substrate (10). A laser beam (20) traverses the amorphous silicon to form a pattern of crystallized silicon (14). The n-crystallized silicon is etched leaving a patterned substrate. The patterned substrate is used as a mark for exposing photoresist on semiconductor elements.

 LASER GENERATED I.C. MASKBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to an improved method of using a laser to generate optical masks for use in patterning layers on semiconductor elements.Various techniques for generating optical masks have been developed wherein, for example, an electron beam "writes" a pattern in photoresist on a glass or quartz mask blank. An older technology exposes photoresist on a mask blank by flashing focused light through a properly chosen aperture. Some of these prior mask generating techniques have also included the use of laser beams. In all of these older techniques a photoresist is used for the optically active material. Photoresists have limitations that make it difficult to make the high- precision masks that are required for integrated circuit and semiconductor device manufacture. Among these limitations are the difficulty of spin coating the glass' or quartz substrate to obtain a uniform coating, the pre-exposure oven bake, the wet development of the exposed photoresist, the post development oven bake, adhesion problems at any step within the process, and the sensitivity of the resist to alpha and gamma particles. All of these process steps are prone to introduce defects in the final optical mask that will reduce the device yield. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an improved method of patterning semiconductor masks. It is desirable that such a method be . 

capable of being performed quickly and capable of economically producing high quality masks.SHORT STATEMENT OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is an improved method of producing optical masks for the manufacture of semiconductor devices. In accordance with the invention, a thin layer, for example, 2,000 angstroms of amorphous silicon is blanket deposited over the surface area of a glass or quartz substrate. A focused laser beam with sufficient power having a wavelength of, for example, 5,145 angstroms, is directed onto the amorphous silicon layer and traverses over the layer to form the pattern required for that particular mask. The laser beam heats the amorphous silicon in areas where the pattern is to occur, thereby crystallizing the silicon. Using conventional plasma etching or reactive ion etching techniques, such as, a conventional SFg ° pl,asma et.c.h, t..he non-cryst.al.l,i.zed, amorphous silicon layer is etched away. The etching process is sufficiently selective to remove the amorphous silicon layer, yet leave the crystallized silicon pattern on the glass or quartz substrate.The
