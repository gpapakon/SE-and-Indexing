<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to acidic rinsing (rinse 
aid) compositions, particularly acidic rinsing 
compositions containing an organo aminophosphonic acid 
component. Rinse aid compositions designed for use in automatic 
dishwasher machines are well known. These compositions are 
added during the rinsing cycle of the machine, separately 
from the detergent composition employed in the main wash 
cycle(s). The ability to enhance rinsing, and in 
particular the ability to prevent spot and film formation 
are common measures of rinse aid performance. Rinse aid compositions typically contain components 
such as nonionic surfactants and/or hydrotropes which 
aid the wetting of the items in the rinse, thereby 
improving the efficacy of the rinsing process. These 
surfactants, and rinse aid compositions in general, 
are not designed for the achievement of a primary soil 
removal purpose.  The general problem of the formation of deposits as spots 
and films on the articles in the wash/rinse, and on the 
dishwasher machine parts is well known in the art. Whilst the general problem of deposit formation is known, a 
full understanding of the many facets of the problem is 
however still an active area of research. A range of deposit types can be encountered. The 
redoposition of soils or the breakdown products thereof, 
which have previously been removed from the soiled 
tableware in the washload, provides one deposit type. 
Insoluble salts such as calcium carbonate, calcium fatty 
acid salts (lime soaps), or certain silicate salts are 
other common deposit types. Composite deposit types are 
also common. Indeed, once an initial minor deposit forms 
it can act as a "seeding centre" for the formation of a 
larger, possibly composite, deposit structure. Deposit formation can occur on a range of commonly 
encountered substrate surfaces including plastic, glass, 
metal and china surfaces. Certain deposit types however, 
show a greater propensity to deposit on certain substrates. 
For example, lime soap deposit formation tends to be a 
particular problem on plastic substrates. The formation of insoluble carbonate, especially calcium 
carbonate, deposits is a particular problem in the machine 
dishwashing art. There is a general appreciation in the 
art, as represented for example by EP-A-364,067 in the name 
of Clorox, CH-A-673,033 in the name of Cosmina, and EP-A-551,670 
in the name of Unilever, that calcium carbonate 
deposit formation is a particular problem when non-phosphate 
containing detergent formulations
