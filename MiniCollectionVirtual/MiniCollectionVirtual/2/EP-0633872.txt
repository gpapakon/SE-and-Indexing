Process for the manufacture of ethylbenzene from 
pure benzene or dilute benzene and a composition (B) 

containing ethylene, characterised in that it consists 
in: 


a) reacting the pure benzene or dilute benzene with the 
composition (B) in an alkylation reaction of benzene 

with ethylene in which the benzene/ethylene molar 
ratio is between 0.3 and 1, so as to obtain an 

alkylate containing practically no residual benzene 
and containing mono-, di- and triethylbenzene; 
b) subjecting this alkylate to at least one distillation/rectification 
in order to obtain a distillate 

(18) containing di- and triethylbenzene; 
c) transalkylating this distillate (18) with benzene 
(22) in order to obtain a transalkylate (25) 

enriched in monoethylbenzene formed from the di- and 
triethylbenzene of the said distillate; 
d) subjecting this transalkylate (25) to at least one 
distillation/rectification in order to obtain 

ethylbenzene (29). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the dilute benzene contains saturated hydrocarbons. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the dilute benzene is a light reformate. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the composition (B) also contains 

saturated hydrocarbons, with the exclusion of unsaturated 
hydrocarbons other than ethylene. 
Process according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that the composition (B) is a distillation fraction of a  

 
fluid catalytic cracking gas containing hydrocarbons 

having a number of carbons less than or equal to 2. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the distillate of stage b) also 

contains monoethylbenzene and in that this distillate is 
subjected to at least one distillation/rectification in 

order to obtain a head fraction containing 
monoethylbenzene and a bottom fraction containing di- and 

triethylbenzene. 
Process according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that the said head fraction containing monoethylbenzene 

is recycled to stage a) in order to obtain alkylation of 
this monoethylbenzene to di- and triethylbenzene. 
Process according to Claim 3 and one of Claims 4 
to 7, characterised in that a petrol fraction formed from 

saturated hydrocarbons, and essentially benzene-free, is 
recovered in stage b) by another distillation/rectification.
