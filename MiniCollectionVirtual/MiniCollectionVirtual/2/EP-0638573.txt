<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a crystalline hydrate of 7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiasole-4-yl)-2(2-carboxyprop-2-oxyimino)acetamido]-3-(5-methyl-1,4,6-triamino-pyrimidium-2-yl)thiomethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylate 
which may be represented by formula(I), 
useful as an antibiotic, and a process for the preparation 
thereof. 
European Patent Publication No. 397,511 discloses a 
cephalosporin of the above formula (I) in an amorphous state which 
has a potent antibiotic efficacy against a wide spectrum of 
pathogenic bacteria including Gram positive and Gram negative 
bacteria producing β-lactamase. However, the amorphous form of said cephalosporin compound as 
disclosed in the above-mentioned EP patent publication is unstable  
 
itself; and, therefore, when exposed to a high temperature or 
stored at a room temperature for a long time, β-lactam ring of the 
cephalosporin of formula(I) is susceptible to a hydrolysis which 
may result in the decomposition of the ring or compound. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to 
provide a crystalline hydrate of the formula(I) cephalosporin, 
possessed with an excellent stability and prolonged shelf-life. As another object of the present invention, there is provided 
a process for preparing said crystalline hydrate of the formula(I) 
cephalosporin. Still another object of the present invention lies in 
providing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a 
therapeutically effective amount of said crystalline hydrate and 
a physiologically acceptable carrier. Fig. 1 depicts an X-ray diffraction diagram for the 
crystalline hydrate of formula(I) cephalosporin.  In accordance with the present invention, it has been found 
that crystalline hydrates of cephalosporin of formula(I) have 
surprisingly effective antibiotic activities against a wide 
spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including Gram positive and 
negative bacteria; and further have an excellent stability even 
under severe conditions. A standard crystalline hydrate form of the compound is 
hexahydrate that normally exits at a temperature of 20°C and a 
relative humidity of 33%; however, tri- to hepta-hydrates of the 
compound are convertible among themselves at a temperature ranging 
from 10°C to 60°C and at a relative humidity ranging from 10 to 
80%, without changing the properties of the compound. This 
conversion is completely reversible; and, therefore, any desired 
form of hydrates can be obtained by controlling, e.g., the 
surrounding temperature and humidity thereof. The crystalline hydrates of the
