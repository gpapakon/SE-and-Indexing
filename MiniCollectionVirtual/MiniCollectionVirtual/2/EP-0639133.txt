<ABSTRACT>
A device (1) for salvaging objects on the seabed, e.g. sunken ships, submarines or other shipwrecked objects. The device (1) is in the form of a raisable and submersible dry-dock (1) with an extendable/retractable slip (2) with sliding/rolling guides (11). Furthermore the device (1) has controllable cranes (6) and winches (10) with means for securing and steering the shipwrecked object. The device (1) is pressure and depth-independent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a device for salvaging objects on the 
seabed, e.g. sunken ships, submarines or other shipwrecked 
objects. Marine pollution is a growing problem to-day. For a number of 
years nuclear waste has been dumped in the sea and in addition 
several nuclear-powered vessels have been wrecked. One example 
is the soviet submarine "Komsomolets" which went down near 
Bjørnøya in 1989. If this submarine amongst others remains 
lying on the seabed, sooner or later reactors and possibly 
weapons on board the vessels will start to leak. This will also 
apply to other radioactive material, such as barrels, reactors, 
etc. In recent times salvage operations and cleaning up of the 
seabed have become of more immediate importance due to these 
pollution hazards. At present there are several known salvaging devices. Amongst 
others the following patent publications can be mentioned: 
DE 2 902 917, DE 3 612 890, DE 406 643, DE 1 022 929, 
DE 138 599, GB 1 310 678, US 3 631 830, US 1 616 410, 
US 4 051 797, US 2 167 989, US 1 250 787, and US 3 722 448. US-A-2 829 615 shows a device for salvaging objects on the 
seabed by means of a raisable and submersible drydoc. The 
drydoc comprises a ship which is non-extendable, fixed to the 
bottom in order to facilitate the pulling of the object onto 
the bottom by means of a winch. US 4 051 797 describes a salvaging device comprising submersible 
elements which together with a surface vessel are connected 
to the wreck by wires. These wires are secured to the 
sides of the wreck by means of an explosive force. The wreck is 
freed from the seabed by detonating explosives under the wreck.  
 US 829 615 concerns a rescue device comprising a dry-dock with 
ballast tanks, which are controlled from the surface. The dock 
is placed on the seabed and pulls the sunken vessel by means of 
a pulley system also controlled from the surface, into the 
dock. The ballast tanks provide the buoyancy.  
 US 1 616 410 describes a device for raising sunken vessels from 
the seabed by means of wires which are passed under the vessel 
by means of a "claw or cable-pulling apparatus". None of the above-mentioned patent publications take into 
account possible sources of pollution such as radioactivity, 
etc. It is also known that salvaging operations have been 
performed or attempted with the use of large cranes with 
"gripping claws". These "claws" are very difficult to manoeuvre 
on account of ocean currents, etc. If such a salvaging operation 
is unsuccessful, e.g. if the wreck
