Method of drying a paper web (9), wherein the paper web is looped
around the jacket surfaces of steam heated, rotatably journalled

dryer cylinders (10), characterized in that the peripheral speed of at
least one dryer cylinder (10) differs from the speed of the paper web

(9) or of the support fabric (2, 3, 4) carrying the paper web.
Method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the peripheral
speed of at least one dryer cylinder (10A, 10C) is higher

than the speed of the paper web (9) or of a support fabric (2, 3, 4)
carrying the paper web.
Method in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the peripheral
speed of at least one dryer cylinder (10G) is lower than the

speed of the paper web (9) or of a support fabric (2, 3, 4) carrying
the paper web.
Method in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the difference between the peripheral speed of the relevant cylinder

(10A, 10E, 10G) is adjustable during the operation.
Dryer section of a paper machine having the following features:

5.1 a plurality of heated dryer cylinders (10) which are arranged in
series;
5.2 a support fabric which loops around the dryer cylinders (10),
with the paper web (9) being covered in sandwich-like manner, 

at least with respect to some dryer cylinders (10), between
their jacket surfaces and the support fabric (2, 3, 4);
5.3 at least some of the dryer cylinders (10) are provided with a
drive in order to impart a specific speed to the paper web and

to the support fabric, characterized by the following features:
5.4 at least one dryer cylinder (10A, 10E, 10G) is drivable at a
speed such that its peripheral speed differs from the speed of

the paper web (9) or of a support fabric (2, 3, 4) carrying the
paper web.
Dryer section in accordance with claim 5, characterized in that the
relevant dryer cylinder (10A, 10E) is drivable with a speed of rotation

such that its peripheral speed is larger than the web speed or that of
a support fabric (2, 3, 4) carrying the web (9).
Dryer section in accordance with claim 5, characterized in that at
least one dryer cylinder (10G) is drivable at a speed of rotation such

that its peripheral speed is smaller than the web speed or than the
speed of a support fabric (2, 3, 4) carrying the paper web (9).
Dryer section in accordance with one of the claims 5 to 7, characterized
in that means for overcoming the static friction between the

paper web (9) and the support (2, 3, 4), on the one hand, and the
jacket surface of the fast running cylinder (10A, 10E), on the other

hand, are associated with the individual fast running cylinders (10A,
10E).
