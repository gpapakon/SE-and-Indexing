<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a probe (1) and method for measuring parameters of fluid flow in a conduit within a human or animal body, with specific application to non-invasive measurement of the cross-sectional area of blood vessels, particularly the ascending aorta (24). The probe (1) contains an ultrasound transducer (2) and an acoustic reflector (4) drivable in an oscillatory manner by an electric motor (8). A narrow ultrasound beam (3) is directed downwardly via the suprasternal notch (26) and swept by the reflector through an arc. The probe (1) has an external dimension transverse to the ultrasound beam path (3) which reduces substantially from the region of the transducer to the region (14) where the beam exits the probe. The invention has application in monitoring cardiac output.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the measurement of 
parameters of fluid flow in a conduit within a human or animal 
body. It has more specific application to flowmeters of Doppler 
ultrasound form, and in a particular application is for use in 
monitoring a patient's blood flow. Flowmeters of the Doppler ultrasound type are routinely used 
in medical practice for measuring and monitoring blood flow in 
patients. These meters are usually designed for transcutaneous 
application, but some have been developed for catheterised 
application into a blood vessel of interest. A device suitable 
for invasive ultrasonic investigation is described in 
US-4 546 771. This device comprises a needle with a sharp point 
for insertion into a human body, the needle containing transducer 
means and beam directing means for directing acoustical beams 
radially from the needle to a point outside of the needle. Meters known from the prior art are often limited to the 
provision of measures only of blood velocity, whereas the medical 
community frequently has an interest in knowing the blood volume 
flow rate in the relevant vessel. This interest extends 
particularly to the case in which the vessel is the ascending 
aorta because the rate is then an effectively direct indication 
of cardiac output. Blood velocity may be measured using the 
Doppler ultrasound method, and blood volume flow rate is provided 
simply as the product of velocity and the vessel cross-sectional 
area. The velocity used in such a calculation is a weighted 
average velocity value to take into account the velocity 
distribution across the vessel diameter. A problem remains in 
attaining an indication of the area in question, and in the case 
of the interest in cardiac output, area is often estimated for a 
given patient by way of a quite separate imaging procedure. 
Margins of error for such measurements can be as high as 20%. 
Access for non-invasive ultrasound monitoring equipment to the 
aorta presents particular problems, as the sternum of the body  
 
provides an effective screen to ultrasound signals. Access is 
possible via the suprasternal notch, but this space is very 
limited in size. It is an object of the present invention to improve this 
situation and to this end there is provided, according to one 
aspect of the invention, a medical probe suitable for use in 
measuring parameters of fluid flow in a conduit within a human or 
animal body, the probe comprising: 
a hollow housing having an ultrasound transparent wall part; transducer means
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A medical probe (1) suitable for use in measuring parameters 
of fluid flow in a conduit within a human or animal body, the 

probe comprising: 

a hollow housing (10) having an ultrasound transparent wall 
part (14); 
transducer means (2) mounted within the housing and operable 
to emit and detect ultrasound beam signals along a path (3); and 
reflecting means (4) within the housing and disposed in said 
path to divert the beam through an angle so as to emerge from the 

housing through an exit portion of the ultrasound transparent 
wall part, wherein the external dimension of the housing 

transverse to said path reduces substantially from the region of 
the transducer means to the region of the exit portion, 

characterised in that the reflecting means are mounted for 
rotation in the narrowed exit portion region. 
A probe according to Claim 1, the probe having a distal part, 
characterised in that the distal part of the probe has a smoothly 

contoured external shaping to permit safe non-invasive use. 
A probe according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
drive means (8) to rotate the reflecting means is mounted within the 

housing. 
A probe according to Claim 3, characterised in that said 
drive means (8) is adapted to rotate the reflecting means in an 

oscillatory fashion. 
A probe according to any preceding claim characterised in 
that the reflecting means is mounted for rotation about an 

axis (7) lying along said beam path. 
A probe according to any preceding claim characterised in 
that the transducer means and the reflecting means are linked to 

rotate together. 
A probe according to any preceding claim characterised in 
that the reflecting means is mounted at an angle of about 45Â° to 

the direction of said beam path.  
 
Apparatus for measuring parameters of fluid flow in a conduit 
within a human or animal body, comprising a probe according to 

any preceding claim and signal processing means (22) to analyse 
Doppler components of the returning ultrasound signals. 
A method for measuring parameters of fluid flow in a conduit 
within a human or animal body using the probe of any of Claims 1 

to 7, which method comprises: 

locating the probe (1) to position the exit portion (14) 
adjacent the skin of the body; 
operating the transducer means (2) to emit an ultrasound 
beam (3); 
directing the ultrasound beam by way of the reflecting 
means (4) substantially along the conduit; 
rotating the reflecting means so as to sweep the ultrasound 
beam through an arc; 
detecting ultrasound beam signals returning from at least one 
range of the beam sweep and analysing the returning signals. 
A method according to Claim 9, characterised in that a 
parameter to be measured is the cross-sectional area of fluid 

flow in a conduit of substantially circular section. 
A method according to Claim 9 or 10 characterised in that the 
conduit is the ascending aorta (24) and the beam is directed by 

way of the suprasternal notch (26). 
A method according to Claim 10 or 11 characterised in that at 
least one velocity measurement is made and the cross-sectional 

area measured is multiplied by the velocity measurement to 
provide an estimate of fluid flow rate within the conduit.
