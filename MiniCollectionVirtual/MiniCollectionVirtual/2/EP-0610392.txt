<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus for 
treating a work surface. The invention has particular application in the 
machining of work surfaces by means of a gas plasma, in the 
protection of very clean surfaces and in applying a layer 
or coating to a surface. Such applications occur in many 
branches of the electrical, electronic and mechanical 
industries as well as in medical treatment, for example in 
a bacterial chamber. Plasma machining methods and plants are known using 
controllable gaseous media in a special sealed chamber. The 
chamber is first pumped out completely and then filled with 
either a pure gas or a required mixture of gases. The 
plasma is activated by a high frequency, or ultra high 
frequency, glow or arc discharge which, depending on the 
composition of the gas mixture or the materials of the 
cathode or the anode, form the required composition of 
plasma for cleaning, pickling or deposition of a film, (see 
for example V.I. Orlov and V.M. Garan, "Plasma Arc Spray 
Deposition of Coatings, Technology and Equipment", in the 
"Reviews of Electronic Equipment" series, "Technology, 
Production Management and Equipment", 1981, issue 18 (833), 
p. 46-47). The chamber in such plants functions under low 
pressure. A higher vacuum tends towards a reduction of the  
 
unwanted impurities in the plasma. However, a higher vacuum 
also leads to a lower density of active particles and to a 
lower density of their flow towards the work surface which 
increases the duration of a treatment such as machining of 
the surface. This constitutes one of the reasons for a 
comparatively low output of such a plant. Furthermore, the 
low output is also a function of the need for a certain 
vacuum level to be continuously maintained, requiring the 
chamber to be pumped out. It is particularly important 
during the replacement of the plasma-generating gas that 
the chamber should be completely emptied of any particles 
in order to get rid of unwanted impurities that might cause 
problems during future machining of a work surface. This 
requirement entails prolonged preparation of the plant for 
operation. Furthermore, the use of gases containing 
aggressive active components, such as fluorine or chlorine, 
may induce reactions on the chamber walls, thus speeding up 
their wear. When such plants are used for a continuous 
machining processes, special sluice chambers have to be 
installed in order to enable there to be communication with 
the atmosphere. However, this requirement is liable to 
bring

A method for plasma machining or treatment of a 
work surface (7), including generating a plasma jet (10) 

at atmospheric pressure by means of delivering a plasma-generating 
gas, feeding working material and moving a 

work holder (6) relative to the feeder (3) of working 
material for moving the work into and out of a machining 

zone, shaping a jet-type shielding gas screen (13) by 
means of a pipe or duct (4) communicating with a source 

(5) of a shielding gas coaxial with and surrounding the 
plasma jet (10), the pipe or duct being arranged around 

the work holder and having a slot (8) extending 
throughout its length and facing towards the machining 

zone and in which a space defined by the walls of the 
pipe or duct is covered by a gas-tight partition (2) 

carrying the generator (1) and the feeder (3), and 
arranging that the distance between the plane of the work 

holder (6) and that of the slot (8) does not exceed L as 
determined from the relationship: 


L = R

V/D 
 
where 


V = the velocity of the shielding gas jet; 
R = the width of the slot in the pipe or duct;
 
and 
D = the coefficient of diffusion of atoms and 
molecules of the ambient medium in the shielding gas jet. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 in which the 
generator and the feeder are sealed by means of pressure-tight 

seals in respective of openings in the gas-tight 
partition. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 in which the 
slot is covered throughout its length by an element made 

of a porous material having a regular structure. 
A method of plasma treatment of the surface of 
a workpiece including generating a plasma jet (26) to 

create an operative or treatment zone, forming (27,28) an 
additional stream (29,30,31) of a shielding or protective 

gas at the operative or treatment zone, bringing the 
workpiece (24) into the operative or treatment zone, 

continuously displacing the workpiece in the operative or 
treatment zone, and the workpiece (24) is brought into 

and taken out of this zone more than once, wherein, 
before the workpiece is brought into or after it is taken 

out of the operative or treatment zone, the additional 
stream of shielding or protective gas is directed in parallel 

to the workpiece surface, by being blown across the surface of 
the workpiece being treated, and placing the surface of 

the workpiece (24) being treated in an initial part of  
 

the plasma jet (26), wherein the length of the initial 
part is found from the relationship
