<DESCRIPTION>
Recently, there has been an extensive emphasis on diet 
with the goal of reducing caloric and cholesterol intake. One 
of the major means of accomplishing this goal is the reduction 
of the intake of fat. Numerous fat mimetic products are known 
and many are available commercially. One such product is an 
oat based extract patented under U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,996,063 and 
5,082,673 issued to G. Inglett; identified as Oatrim and sold 
by Rhone-Poulenc Inc. This product is the solids portion of 
the soluble fraction that remains after the partial hydrolysis 
of oat flour with α-amylase enzyme. The product has a 
elevated content of β-glucan. In addition to acting as a fat 
mimic, the product also has the benefit of the known ability 
of oat soluble fiber and β-glucan to reduce cholesterol levels 
in the blood. While Oatrim has been used in various food systems as a 
fat mimic or replacer, it has various limitations relative to 
the area of use. In particular, Oatrim has been added to 
various ground meat products in order to prepare a reduced fat 
meat patty or sausage. However, Oatrim by itself in meat 
products, while providing cook yields, provides a meat product 
that exhibits a weak or mushy texture. Oatrim as presently 
constituted cannot be used effectively as a fat mimetic 
because of these characteristics and conditions.  Recently, certain hydrocolloid/gum compositions have been 
prepared which provide good yield and texture when used in a 
fat reduced beef product; however, these hydrocolloid/gum 
containing meat products have been criticized as being dry and 
devoid of beef flavor. Because of these organoleptic 
shortcomings, sales of reduced fat meat products have been 
lagging. It has now been discovered that certain Oatrim 
compositions can be prepared that, when used with comminuted 
meat offer improved handling, organoleptic qualities and 
economies over prior reduced fat meat products. In accordance with the invention, water soluble and 
insoluble dietary fiber-containing compositions which are 
based on cereal hydrolysates are provided which are 
characterized by having good cook yields in comminuted meats 
as well as organoleptic characteristics comparable to the full 
fat product and also the benefits of β-glucan. The claimed 
compositions of this invention comprise 1) said cereal 
hydrolysate dietary fiber-containing material; 2) oat bran; 3) 
corn syrup solids; and 4) optionally torula yeast and can be 
mixed with food to effect a replacement of fat or other 
ingredients or act as a

A cereal hydrolysate containing composition for use 
as a fat mimic in foods comprising: 


A. a cereal hydrolysate composition prepared by 
hydrolyzing an aqueous dispersion of a cereal 

substrate with an amylase enzyme under conditions 
which will hydrolyse the starch without appreciable 

solubilization of the substrate protein to yield a 
water soluble fraction, and a water insoluble 

fraction, and selected from the group consisting of 
a) said water soluble fraction, b) said water 

insoluble fraction, c) said water soluble dietary 
fiber solids isolated from said soluble fraction, 

and d) a combination of a) and b); 
B. oat bran; and 
C. corn syrup solids; 
 
all of the above in amounts which, when intimately mixed 

with food, are sufficient to provide a fat reduced product 
having the texture and mouthfeel comparable to a full fat 

product. 
A composition as claimed in claim 1 characterized in 
that the cereal substrate dispersion is in the range of 

about 10-40% solids. 
A composition as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 
characterized in that said cereal substrate comprises a 

flour selected from the group of oats, barley, wheat, corn, 
rice, rye, triticale, and milo from barley. 
A comminuted meat composition containing a fat mimic 
comprising: 


A. a cereal hydrolysate composition prepared by 
hydrolyzing an aqueous dispersion of a cereal 

substrate with an amylase enzyme under conditions 
which will hydrolyse the starch without appreciable 

solubilization of the substrate protein to yield a 
water soluble fraction, and a water insoluble 

fraction, and selected from the group consisting of 
a) said water soluble fraction, b) said water 

 
insoluble fraction, c) said water soluble dietary 

fiber solids isolated from said soluble fraction, 
and d) a combination of a) and b); 
B. oat bran; 
C. corn syrup solids; and 
D. comminuted meat; 
 
all of the above in amounts which, when intimately mixed 

with said comminuted meat, are sufficient to provide a fat 
reduced comminuted meat product having the texture and 

mouthfeel comparable to a full fat product. 
A composition as claimed in claim 4 characterized in 
that the cereal hydrolysate is present from about 0.75 to 

about 1.25 weight percent based on the total weight of the 
composition. 
A composition as claimed in claim 4 or claim 5 
characterized in that the oat bran is present from about 0.5 

to about 1.25 weight percent based on the total weight of 
the composition. 
A composition as claimed in claim 5 or claim 6 
characterized in that the corn syrup solids is present from 

about 0.1 to about 0.75 weight percent based on the total 
weight of the composition. 
A composition as claimed in any of claims 5 to 7 
characterized in that the composition additionally contains 

torula yeast from about 0.25 to about 1.0 weight percent 
based on the total weight of the composition. 
A composition as claimed in any of claims 5 to 8 
characterized in that the composition additionally contains 

encapsulated salt from about 0.1 to about 0.8 weight percent 
based on the total weight of the composition. 
A comminuted meat composition comprising: 

i) a dietary fiber product produced by the method of: 

a. treating an aqueous dispersion of a cereal 
substrate with an a-amylase under conditions which 

will hydrolyze the substrate starch without 
appreciable solubilization of the substrate protein

b. separating said soluble fraction from said 
insoluble fraction under conditions which minimize 

the level of protein in the soluble fraction;
