<ABSTRACT>
A satellite heat removal means can be embodied as an original 
nuclear system feature but is especially adapted to be retrofitted to an 

existing nuclear reactor system to serve optionally to supplement heat 
removal from the system nuclear reactor containment upon happening of 

a LOCA, and to assume all system containment drywell venting in the event 
reactor core meltdown results in breach of the containment floor structure 

separating the containment drywell and wetwell space which breach would 
deprive the containment of a space to which a non-condensable fraction of 

LOCA generated heated fluid in the containment could be vented, cooled 
and stored. The satellite heat removal means includes a structure external 

of but preferably situated alongside 
the nuclear reactor containment (12). A 

heat exchanger (62) surrounded by a pool (60) 
of cooling water is located in an 

upper chamber (52) of the structure while 
a pool (63) of water is present in a lower 

chamber (56) of the structure. The heat exchanger (62) 
is communicated with the 

containment drywell (20) by inlet and outlet conduits (66,68) 
so that heated fluid in the 

containment (12) can enter and be cooled in 
the heat exchanger (62) with a cooled 

condensate fraction being returned from the heat exchanger (62) to the 
containment drywell (20), and a non-condensable 

gas fraction vented to the pool (63) 
of water in the lower chamber (56). A gas space (64) above the lower 

chamber pool (63) of water substitutes as the wetwell 
gas space (42) to which non-condensables 

vent in place of the containment wetwell gas space (42) 
that was breached and 

thus merged with the containment drywell space (20) as an incident of the 
LOCA. Cooling function is thus effective even upon breach of the 

containment floor structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to passive cooling of a nuclear reactor 
containment. The invention is particularly directed to an isolation 
condenser type passive cooling system which can be installed externally of 
the nuclear reactor containment as well as building structure in which the 
containment is situated, the cooling system being such as minimizes need 
to penetrate the containment and building enclosure with cooling system 
components. EP-A-460,805 and U.S. Patents Nos 5,082,619 
and 5,106,571 disclose use of 
isolation condensers in connection with passive removal of initial and decay 
heat loads generated in a nuclear reactor system containment as a result of 
and upon occurrence of a LOCA, i.e., a loss-of-coolant accident in the 
system. The cooling systems disclosed in these pending applications also can 
dissipate initial heat by venting the reactor pressure vessel and/or the 
containment drywell space to a suppression pool of water confined in a 
chamber surrounding the reactor pressure vessel. Venting to the 
suppression pool also can be used with respect to condensate recovery of 
the isolation condensers, and non-condensable gasses such as nitrogen, 
which are cooled in an isolation condenser and separated from the 
condensate. Venting from the containment drywell of heated, pressurized fluid 
and venting of condensate and non-condensable gasses from the isolation 
condensers to the suppression pool, is possible because a pressure 
differential exists between these fluids and gasses on the one hand, and the 
airspace above the suppression pool water on the other hand.  In other nuclear reactor systems, LOCA heat loads are dissipated 
in different manner. For example, a type of nuclear system that was built 
in some numbers in the 1960's and 1970's has a containment which includes 
an upper space in which the nuclear reactor is disposed, and a lower space 
defining a suppression pool chamber in which cooling water is present with 
there being an airspace above the water. The upper and lower spaces are 
separated by a horizontal structural element, e.g., a concrete floor. A 
concrete pedestal extends upwardly a distance from the concrete floor in 
the upper space and serves as a mounting on which the reactor pressure 
vessel is received and supported. A plurality of vertically disposed vent 
tubes are arranged in circle array in the floor and have entry ends 
communicating with the upper space, lower outlet ends of these vent tubes 
locating submerged in the suppression pool water. On
