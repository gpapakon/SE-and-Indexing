<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of preparing a heterocyclic 
intermediate for the production of optically active aryloxy-substituted 
vicinal aminoalcohols. The invention also relates to an optically active 
heterocyclic compound, as well as to a method of its preparation and to 
its use. A large number of pharmaceutically active agents belong to the class of 
aryloxy-substituted vicinal aminoalcohols, for example, the β-blockers 
(β-adrenoceptor antagonists) acebutolol, atenolol, metoprolol, 
betaxolol, bisoprolol, esmolol, metipranolol, practolol, alprenolol, 
oxprenolol, befunolol, propranolol, pindolol, carazolol, indenolol, 
mepindolol, moprolol, toliprolol, bucumolol, bufetolol, bunitrolol, 
bupranolol, butofilolol, carteolol, celiprolol, cetamolol, cloranolol, 
levobunolol, nadolol, penbutolol, talinolol, tertatolol, xibenolol and 
penirolol.
 
All these pharmaceutically active agents contain a chiral centre in 
their molecular structure and therefore give rise to optical isomerism. 
It is generally known in the art that only one of the enantiomers 
displays the desired biological activity (the so-called eutomer) and 
that the presence of its optical antipode may lead to side effects. 
Therefore, it is generally deemed more and more desirable to administer 
the biologically active agent in the form of its pure eutomer rather 
than the racemic mixture. A well-known method for the preparation of aryloxy-substituted vicinal 
aminoalcohols is the coupling of 1-(ar)alkylamino-2,3-propanediols or 
protected forms thereof with aromatic alcohols. The synthesis of 
optically active 1-alkylamino-2,3-propanediols or protected forms 
thereof has been described in literature, e.g. by Bianchi et al. in J. 
Org. Chem. 1988, 53, 5531-34. Bianchi et al. disclose the lipase-catalyzed 
stereoselective esterification of racemic alcohols, e.g. of 5-hydroxymethyl-3-alkyl-oxazolidin-2-one, 
as a method for the resolution  
 
of the racemic mixtures. In this manner the desired R or S isomers can 
be obtained in high enantiomeric purities. Although the yields are 
satisfactory, viz. approx. 40% calculated on starting racemate, it will 
be obvious that a "loss" of approx. 60%, mainly consisting of the 
undesired R-enantiomer of the above hydroxymethyl-oxazolidinone 
compound, is a serious drawback. Margolin (Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1993, 
Vol. 15, 266-268) has expressed this commonly felt disadvantage in a 
slightly different way, by stating: "However, none of the procedures 
proposed so far addresses an important issue
