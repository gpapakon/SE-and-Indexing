<ABSTRACT>
A process is described to realize a film made of an adequate resinous material on the internal surface of metallic pipes, particularly those made of aluminium, to protect them and further allow for particular uses for which they could not be employed otherwise. These pipes are preferably applied in the hydrothermosanitary field.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention deals with a process for 
coating the internal surface of hydrothermosanitary 
pipes, particularly made of aluminium, with 
resinous products, also of the atoxic type or "for 
foods", and with the related pipes obtained with 
such process.  
 An apparatus for coating the inside of a pipe 
with a wear-resistant material is disclosed in US-A-4262627. 
This apparatus comprises an abrading 
probe to prime and prepare the inner surface of the 
pipe and a coating probe to coat the inner surface 
of the pipe. Both probes are arranged to move back 
and forth inside the pipe. EP-A-⊘4731⊘3 discloses a method of coating 
internal surfaces of multi-branched pipelines 
wherein a sponge consisting of an elastic foam body 
is inserted into the pipeline. The sponge is then 
pushed with the aid of air pressure whereby the 
inner surface of the pipeline can be shaped to have 
substantially uniform film thickness.  
 In hydrothermosanitary plants, pipes play a 
role that cannot be neglected. Currently, pipes 
made of iron (zinc-coated pipes), of copper or 
resinous materials, etc. are used. Aluminium pipes, 
even though they cost much legs, are not used, 
because they can be easily corroded from the 
chemical and electro-chemical (stray currents) 
points of view. All metallic pipes can then be affected by 
limestone, depending on hardness and 
temperature of water. Problems deriving from limestone, 
chemical corrosions and stray currents are solved 
for metallic pipes, but above all for aluminium  
 
pipes, by adopting the protection of the internal 
surface thereof, protection that can be achieved by 
the process claimed by the present invention. After having carried out the pipe seal test 
(in coils or in rods), through pressurized air, in 
order to ascertain the absence of defects (due to 
pores or cracks), a resinous liquid is injected 
inside the pipe (generally kept at ambient 
temperature), said liquid having to wet all the 
internal surface thereof. In order to enable the 
whole internal pipe surface to be affected by the 
resinous liquid flowing inside it, the pipe 
(generally in coils) is placed and kept slowly 
oscillating or slowly rotating for all the length 
of the present operation and of the further 
operations. Afterwards, air is blown into the pipe, and 
the liquid is made turbulent (facilitating wetting 
of possible areas that had not been affected by 
it) and the excess liquid is removed. Then, a gauged head, equipped with adequate 
gaskets (shaped as a socket, like those used for

Process for coating the internal surface of hydrothermosanitary 
pipes, particularly made of aluminium, with resinous products, said 

resinous products also being of the atoxic type or "for foods", 
characterized in that said process comprises the steps of: 


injecting resinous liquid inside a pipe composing a coil, or 
inside an arrangement of an assembly of pipes in rods mutually 

connected in series in order to guarantee a continuity, the resin 
product being of the atoxic type; 
slowly oscillating or slowly rotating the pipe composing a 
coil or an arrangement of an assembly of pipes in rods mutually 

connected in series in order to create a continuity around an axis 
thereof; 
blowing-in air to make said resinous liquid turbulent and to 
remove an excess part of said resinous liquid; 
generating a film of said resinous liquid on the internal 
surface of said pipes; 
inserting a head equipped with a gasket that urged by 
compressed air is made pass inside said pipe, thereby shaving the 

internal surface thereof; 
taking into an oven said pipe composing a coil, or said 
arrangement of an assembly of pipes in rods mutually connected in 

series, in order to create a continuity; 
simultaneously passing heated air inside said pipe composing a 
coil, or said arrangement of an assembly of pipes in rods mutually 

connected in series, thereby carrying out stabilization of said 
resinous film. 
Process for coating hydrothermosanitary pipes according to claim 
1, characterized in that the pipe composing a coil or the arrangement 

of an assembly of pipes in rods mutually connected in series in order 
to guarantee a continuity is subjected to slow oscillation or slow 

rotation around an axis thereof until stabilization of said resinous  
 

film is obtained. 
Process for coating hydrothermosanitary pipes according to claim 
1 or 2, characterized in that said axis of oscillation or rotation is 

such that the position variation prevents separations or liquid 
accumulations due to gravity and facilitates wetting of previously-excluded 

areas. 
Process for coating hydrothermosanitary pipes according to any 
of the previous claims, characterized in that said gasket gauging and 

smoothing the internal surface of said pipe and ejecting through said 
head a possible excess part of said resinous liquid is shaped as a 

socket. 
Process for coating hydrothermosanitary pipes according to the 
previous claims, characterized in that removal of solvent vapours, 

that go out of said resinous liquid film distributed on said internal 
surface, is carried out through said heated air passing inside said 

pipe. 
Process for coating hydrothermosanitary pipes according to the 
previous claims, characterized in that by repeating twice or more 

times the described cycle of steps, two or more overlapped films can 
be obtained, films that can be of a different nature one from the 

other, depending on the different resinous liquids used for the 
different cycles. 
A metallic pipe composing a coil obtained with the process 
according to the previous claims, characterized in that its internal 

surface includes a smooth and continuous thin uniform atoxic resinous 
film having resistance properties so that no disjunction of the film 

occur during shaping or bending thereof.
