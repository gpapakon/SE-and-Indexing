<ABSTRACT>
A device for feeding film (6) for packeting articles in general, 
of the type comprising a plurality of guide rollers (1A, B, C, D) 

for the film (6), a motorized roller (2) connected to a drive 
motor (3) and arranged to feed the film (6) towards an entry 

station (8) of a packaging line, and means (5, 4) for sensing the 
film tension and movement. 
The tension sensing means are at least one means (5) for measuring 
the pressure exerted by the film (6) on one (1C) of said guide 

rollers (1A-D).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to device for feeding a film for packeting 
articles in general of the type comprising a plurality of guide 
rollers, at least one motorized roller connected to a drive motor 
and arranged to feed the film towards the entry station of a 
packaging line, and means for sensing the film tension and 
movement. In the present context a packeting film means any known 
plastics material usually used for packaging articles in general, 
in particular food products. It is known to introduce the film into the entry station of a 
packaging line under a constant tension which must riot be 
influenced by the diameter of the reel from which the film is 
unrolled or by possible braking action exerted by members (such as 
usual automatic reel changers) positioned upstream of the 
motorized roller. To measure the film tension it is known to use a movable guide 
roller of floating type. This movable roller is provided between 
the motorized roller and the entry station of the packaging line It is also known to measure the film advancement speed by an 
encoder associated with the motor of the film drive members 
provided in the packaging line. In known devices the motor connected to the motorized roller is 
controlled via a usual control unit of microprocessor type which 
receives as input the signals from said encoder and a signal 
relative to the position of said movable floating roller.  In this manner the speed of the motorized roller motor can be 
regulated on the basis of the speed of the film drive members and 
can be corrected on the basis of the floating roller position. Although this device is widely used it has two serious drawbacks. The first drawback is related to the fact that the usual film 
tension measurement means generally provide the control unit with 
false measurements if the film type varies, in particular if the 
elastic characteristics of the film used for packeting vary. In addition as the film type varies, the extent of pull of the 
drive members along the packaging line also varies. It therefore often happens that the control unit controlling the 
motor associated with the motorized roller controls the motor on 
the basis of false data. Consequently with known devices, as the characteristics and speed 
of advancement of the film used for packeting vary, the packet 
dimensions (in particular its length) or the position of any 
writing on the film often undesirably vary. An object of the present invention is to provide a device of the 
aforesaid type in which both the speed
