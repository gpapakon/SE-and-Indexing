<ABSTRACT>
A radio-corrected electronic timepiece by placing it 
into a power save state according to whether or not the user 

is actually using the timepiece. 
A detecting means 102 detects whether not the timepiece 
is in use. A stock condition memory circuit 106 stores power 

save mode conditions. A comparing circuit 107 makes a 
comparison between output signals from a calculated result 

memory circuit 105 and the stock condition memory circuit 
106. A receiving start judging circuit 110 judges whether or 

not a receiving means 111 should be started. A display 
switching means 108 judges whether or not timing and other 

information should be outputted to a displaying means 109 on 
the basis of a result of the comparison made by the comparing 

circuit 107.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radio-corrected 
electronic timepiece which is designed so that the current 
consumption is reduced, and accurate time is obtained. Conventional radio-corrected electronic timepieces have 
heretofore been arranged to automatically enter a receiving 
state every predetermined time until the battery becomes 
dead. Fig. 3 is a system block diagram of a conventional 
electronic timepiece. A received time comparing circuit 306 
is supplied with an output signal from a timing signal 
calculating circuit 301, which arithmetically processes 
timing and other information, and an output signal from a 
received time memory circuit 305 previously stored with 
predetermined time (time at which receiving is to be 
started), and makes a comparison to judge whether or not 
timing data obtained from the timing signal calculating 
circuit 301 matches timing data stored in the received time 
memory circuit 305. When the result of the comparison shows 
that the two pieces of timing data match each other, a 
receiving means 302 is activated. The receiving means 302 is 
normally in a receiving stop state, but when brought into a  
 
receiving start state, it receives an externally transmitted 
standard timing signal, judges whether or not the received 
data has predetermined information and outputs a signal to a 
transmitting circuit 303 that outputs a correction pulse to 
the timing signal calculating circuit 301. A displaying 
means 304 is supplied with an output signal from the timing 
signal calculating circuit 301 and displays timing and other 
information. The above-described conventional structure is disclosed 
in, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open JP-A-54-97462(1979). However, the conventional radio-corrected electronic 
timepiece performs receiving until a power source, e.g., a 
battery, becomes dead regardless of whether or not the user 
carries (uses) it. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to 
provide an electronic timepiece arranged such that whether or 
not the user carries (uses) the electronic timepiece is 
detected, and when the user does not carry (use) it, the 
timepiece is inhibited from receiving; in the case of a 
digital timepiece, an LCD or the like is turned off to place 
the timepiece into a power save state, thereby extending the  
 
battery lifetime. It is another object of the present 
invention to provide a radio-corrected electronic timepiece 
which is compellingly placed into a receiving state when it 
is detected that the
