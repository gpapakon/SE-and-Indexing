<ABSTRACT>
The electronic immobilising device has a key (1) on which a transmitting unit (5) and a transponder (13) are accommodated independently of one another. When a button (3) on the key (1) is activated, a code signal is transmitted to a receiver (2) in the motor vehicle by the transmitting unit (5), as a result of which the doors are locked or unlocked. In addition, this code signal serves to enable the immobiliser. If the key (1) is plugged into the steering wheel lock (10), a code signal is also transmitted by the transponder (13) to disable the immobiliser. Thus, even if either the transponder (13) or the transmitting unit (5) fail, it is ensured that the motor vehicle is available.
