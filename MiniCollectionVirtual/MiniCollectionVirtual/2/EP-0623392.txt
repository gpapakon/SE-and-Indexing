<ABSTRACT>
Methods and apparatus are disclosed for applying 
a stripe of hot melt coating material at an application 

temperature over longitudinally welded seam areas (21) of can 
bodies (10). The hot melt coating material applied to the 

welded seam areas (21) is then cured by cooling the coating 
material to a curing temperature below the application 

temperature of the melt coating material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the application of 
protective coatings to the interior seams of cans and, 
more particularly, to a method and apparatus for applying 
a hot melt stripe to the interior welded, overlapped seam 
or butt weld seam of a three-piece metal can. The process of manufacturing three-piece metal 
cans involves forming a cylindrical can body from a sheet 
of metal and then attaching two lids to the opposite ends 
of the can body. To form the cylindrical can body, a 
sheet or blank of metal is wrapped around a so-called 
stubhorn. The ends of the sheet are either butted or 
overlapped and secured together by a welded seam, a 
soldered seam, or a cemented seam. The interior of this 
seam is then covered with a protective coating which 
functions to protect the contents of the can against metal 
contamination. Continuity of the protective coating is extremely 
critical because any pinholes, cracks or imperfections in 
the coating will render the can unsuitable for most 
applications. After covering the seam with the protective 
coating, the can is subjected to heat for curing the 
coating material. The curing process is applied only to 
the area of the can seam. Therefore, any coating material 
applied to the interior of the can, other than in the seam 
area, will not be cured.  The present invention is primarily concerned with 
applying a continuous, protective coating onto the 
interior surface of a welded can seam. Welded can seams 
tend to be more brittle and more irregular than soldered 
can seams, and therefore, generally require a thicker 
protective coating than might be required by a soldered 
can seam. A thick coating of protective material can be 
applied by a variety of methods including roller coating, 
powder coating, and airless spray of a lacquer coating. 
Each of these methods is deficient for a variety of 
reasons. The first or roller coating method is generally 
expensive because it requires careful and time consuming 
maintenance of the application equipment. The second or powder coating method, while capable 
of covering the welded seam of a can with a high quality, 
thick stripe of material, is expensive because of the 
added cost of the powder material itself and the need to 
pass a coated can through a curing oven to cure the powder 
coating. The use of a curing oven increases the cost of 
the manufacturing process because of additional time 
needed to complete the curing process and the additional 
expenses relating to higher usage of energy, added capital 
equipment

<CLAIMS>
A method of applying a stripe of hot melt coating 
material over longitudinally welded seam areas of can 

bodies, comprising the steps of moving a series of can 
bodies having a longitudinally welded seam area line past 

a nozzle orifice of a hot melt gun, locating the hot melt 
gun interiorly of the can bodies whereby the nozzle 

orifice is located in close proximity to the welded seam 
areas, supplying hot melt coating material to the hot melt 

gun above a first temperature sufficient to maintain the 
hot melt coating material as a liquid while being 

dispensed from the nozzle orifice, dispensing the hot melt 
coating material as a liquid from the nozzle orifice 

whereby the hot melt coating material is applied to the 
welded seam areas, and moving the series of can bodies 

away from the nozzle orifice whereby the hot melt coating 
material applied to the welded seam areas is cooled below 

a second temperature to cure the hot melt coating 
material. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 including the step 
of supplying the hot melt coating material to the hot melt 

gun at a first temperature of between about 325 degrees to 
400 degrees Fahrenheit. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2 including the 
step of supplying the hot melt coating material to the hot 

melt gun at a pressure of between about 500 psi and 700 
psi. 
A method as claimed in any of the preceding claims 
wherein the hot melt coating material is a thermoplastic 

material. 
A method as claimed in any of the preceding claims 
wherein the second temperature is about 300 degrees 

Fahrenheit. 
A method as claimed in claim 3 including the step 
of maintaining the pressure of the hot melt coating 

material being supplied to the hot melt gun, substantially 
constant. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim 
including the step of intermittently dispensing the 

coating material from the nozzle orifice in 
synchronization with the can body movement along the can 

forming line. 
Apparatus for applying a stripe of hot melt 
coating material over longitudinally welded seam areas of 

can bodies, comprising a supply of hot melt coating 
material, means for transporting the can bodies down a 

stubhorn of a can forming device and a spray gun attached 
to one end of the stubhorn and connected to the supply of 

hot melt coating material, the spray gun being adapted to 
dispense the hot melt coating material as a liquid from a 

nozzle orifice for application to the welded seam areas. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 8 wherein the hot 
melt coating material is a thermoplastic material. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 8 or 9 including 
means for moving the can bodies away from the nozzle 

orifice whereby the hot melt coating material applied to 
the welded seam areas is cooled to cure the hot melt 

coating material.
