<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dielectric ceramic material 
and more particularly, to a dielectric ceramic material 
suitable for forming resonators designed to operate in the 
microwave frequencies. It also relates to a method for 
preparing the same. To meet the current drastically increasing demand for 
mobile radio communications, it is strongly required to reduce 
the size of equipment used therefor. In such communications, 
filters, diplexers and other circuits including resonator 
elements are used for frequency selection. The resonators must 
be reduced in size before the size reduction requirement of 
communication equipment can be met. The resonators consist of 
dielectric elements. Since the size of dielectric resonators 
is in inverse proportion to the square root of the dielectric 
constant of dielectric materials, a material having a greater 
dielectric constant must be found in order to enable size 
reduction of resonators. A shift of service frequency toward a 
higher frequency requires to increase the packing density of 
parts, which in turn, requires further size reduction. There 
are some attempts to form circuits from multilayer dielectric 
substrates.  Under the circumstances, the dielectric materials have to 
meet not only conventional requirements including a high 
dielectric constant in the microwave frequencies and a low 
temperature coefficient τf of resonance frequency, but also be 
co-firable with conductors. Among prior art microwave 
dielectric materials, Ba(Mg1/3Ta2/3)O₃ and Ba(Zn1/3Ta2/3)O₃ are 
known to have a high dielectric constant in the microwave 
frequencies. However, since these microwave dielectric 
materials including Ba(Mg1/3Ta2/3)O₃ and Ba(Zn1/3Ta2/3)O₃ have 
a firing temperature as high as about 1,300°C, it is difficult 
to achieve fine or complex networks of conductor when the 
dielectric material is co-fired with the conductor. Inversely, 
those dielectric materials having a lower firing temperature 
have a low dielectric constant, for example, a (glass + TiO₂) 
system having a dielectric constant of about 10. Therefore, an object of the present invention is to 
provide a dielectric ceramic material which is low-temperature 
firable and has a minimal temperature coefficient of resonance 
frequency in the microwave frequencies, a high dielectric 
constant, and a high Q·f value. Another object of the present 
invention is to provide a method for preparing such a 
dielectric ceramic material. In a first form, the present invention provides a 
dielectric ceramic
