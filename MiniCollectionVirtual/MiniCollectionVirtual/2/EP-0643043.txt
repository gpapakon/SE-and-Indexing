<ABSTRACT>
Novel compounds of formula I have been discovered that are 
particularly effective as nucleation accelerators or 

boosters when employed with hydrazide nucleators in the 
formulation of silver halide emulsions for lithographic 

film. The novel compounds contain bis-ureido groups 
joined by an alkyleneoxy moiety or recurring alkyleneoxy 

moieties. The 2-nitrogen of each ureido group can carry 
groups comprising hydrogen, aryl, alkyl or dialkylaminoalkyl, 

alike or different.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel compositions useful
as high contrast boosters or accelerators used in
combination with hydrazide nucleators in lithographic
films. The invention specifically relates to novel
boosters comprising bis ureido alkyleneoxy compositions
used in conjunction with high contrast promoting
hydrazide nucleators and to the emulsions and film
articles containing the novel boosters. The invention
also relates to the process for producing the emulsions
and film articles containing the novel boosters.It has long been a major challenge to artisans
engaged in the formulation of photographic emulsions for
lithographic film to find improved emulsion formulations,
film articles and/or methods of development that would
yield an increasingly sharp reproduction of an image
showing superior qualities of contrast. The relatively
recent advent of rapid access developers has intensified
this challenge to the artisan since some aspects of the
chemistry of these newer developers tend to work against
the development of high contrast images.According to the prior art, to obtain high contrast
in lithographic films, it necessary to use a high
chloride lith emulsion to prepare a film and process the
exposed film in a hydroquinone-only developer containing
low sulfite. This type of developer had low capacity and
was prone to serious degradation of key properties due to
aerial oxidation over as little as 1-3 days. The
aldehyde bisulfite used to produce the low sulfite
concentration also interfered with the hydroquinone using
erratic, even non-reproducible development activity.
This high contrast "lith effect" (infectious development) 
was described as early as 1945 in J. Frank. Inst. 239,
221 (1945).Some initial contrast-enhancing improvements in the
art were taught in US-A-2,419,975
where an increase is noted in speed and contrast by
developing in the presence of hydrazine compounds.
However, sulfite necessary as an antioxidant in the
developer tended to lessen this "hydrazide" effect.
Also, many of their hydrazines were used in large
quantities and were highly toxic besides being somewhat
nonspecific fogging agents that tended to produce high
fog in unexposed areas.US-A-4,269,929 discloses an
improved hydrazide effect for contrast enhancement by
using hydrazines (nucleators) in conjunction with a
hydroquinone (H2Q) plus phenidone developer that could
contain a high level of sulfite ( SO - / 3 ) to prevent aerial
oxidation. By further incorporating an amine compound in
the developer, a high capacity, stable,
