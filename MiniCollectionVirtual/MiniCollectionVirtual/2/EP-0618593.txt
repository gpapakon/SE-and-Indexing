<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for holding resistive strips for a power resistor, exhibiting the form of a ribbon folded into a zig-zag, comprising a metal support accommodating a comb for holding the strips which is formed by a succession of elementary combs made of an insulating material mounted floating on the support, insulation means of dielectric material being provided between two adjacent elementary combs so as to be interposed between the ribbon and the support, characterised in that the support (10) and the elementary combs (1, 21, 22) have complementary shapes so as to constitute a slider system, two adjacent elementary combs having their opposing ends exhibiting shapes which are matched to constitute the said insulation means.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for holding resistive strips for a power resistor in the 
form of a zigzag folded ribbon, the apparatus comprising a metal 

support (10) receiving a comb for holding tapes, the comb being made 
up of a succession of unit combs (1, 21, 22) made of insulating 

material that are mounted floating on the support (10), insulating 
means of dielectric material between two adjacent unit combs (1, 21, 

22) to be interposed between the ribbon and the support (10), the 
apparatus being characterized in that the support (10) and the unit 

combs (1, 21, 22) have complementary shapes so as to make up a 
slideway system, two adjacent unit combs having facing ends (5, 6) of 

complementary shapes so as to constitute said insulating means. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the support 
(10) is a channel section member with folded-in edges (11, 12), the 

unit combs (1, 21, 22) being provided with lateral grooves (2, 3) in 
which said folded-in edges (11, 12) are engaged. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
metal support (10) is provided with transverse end plates (13, 14). 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterized in that one of the 
end plates (13) constitutes an abutment for the unit combs in 

translation. 
Apparatus according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in that each 
end plate includes at least one fixing hole (16, 17). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the complementary shapes of the ends of the unit combs consist 

in one of the ends (6) of one unit comb overlapping over the end (5) 
of the adjacent unit comb.
