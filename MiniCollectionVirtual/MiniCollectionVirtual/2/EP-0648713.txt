This invention relates to the preparation of a glass exhibiting a transition 
temperature normally below about 300°, a working temperature below about 400°, 

while, at the same time, exhibiting excellent resistance to attack by water.

mole percent on the oxide basis, of 15-35% P₂O₅, 1-25% SO₃, 30-55% ZnO, 0-25% 
R₂O, wherein R₂O is selected from the group consisting of 0-25% Li₂O, 0-25% Na₂O, 

and 0-25% K₂O, and up to a total of 15% of optional ingredients in the indicated 
proportions selected from the group consisting of 0-10% Al₂O₃, 0-10% MgO, 0-10% 

CaO, 0-10% SrO, 0-10% BaO, 0-10% MnO, 0-10% transition metal oxides and 0-15%

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a zinc-sulfophosphate glass exhibiting an 
extremely low softening point of about less than 300° C and exhibiting excellent 
resistance to moisture attack. Considerable research has been conducted in the past to devise inorganic 
glasses exhibiting low transition temperatures (Tg), thereby enabling melting and 
forming operations to be carried out at low temperatures with consequent savings in 
energy costs. As conventionally defined, the transition temperature of a glass is that 
temperature at which notable increase in thermal expansion coefficient is recorded, 
accompanied by a change in specific heat (Cp). More recently, it has been recognized 
that glasses demonstrating low transition temperatures are potentially useful materials 
for a host of applications including low temperature sealing glasses and glass-organic 
polymer composites. A very recent development disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 
5,043,369 (Bahn et al.) involves the production of glass-organic polymer alloys. 
Those alloys are prepared from a glass and a thermoplastic or thermosetting polymer 
having compatible working temperatures. Thus, the glass and the polymer are  
 
combined at the working temperature to form an intimate mixture; that is, the glass 
and polymer are in a sufficiently fluid state to be co-formed together to form a body 
displaying an essentially uniform, fine-grained microstructure in which, desirably, 
there is at least partial miscibility and/or a reaction between the glass and the polymer 
to promote adhesion and bonding therebetween. An article is shaped from the blend 
and then cooled to room temperature. Such articles exhibit chemical and physical 
properties comprising a complementary blend of those demonstrated by the particular 
glass and polymer. For example, the alloys frequently display a combination of high 
surface hardness, high stiffness, and high toughness. Alloys are distinguished from 
glass/organic polymer composites in that there is at least partial miscibility and/or a 
reaction between the glass and polymer which condition(s) is absent in glass/polymer 
composites. Glasses having base compositions within the general zinc phosphate system 
have been found to be especially suitable for the glass component of glass-polymer 
alloys, U. S. Patent No. 4,940,677 and 5,071,795. These zinc phosphate glasses demonstrate relatively good resistance to 
chemical attack when compared to other phosphate-based glasses. Nevertheless, the 
search has been continuous to discover
