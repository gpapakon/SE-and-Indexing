<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method for optically measuring 
concentrations of components are disclosed, which allow 

enhancement in measurement accuracy of concentration. The 
apparatus comprises a cell (1), a light irradiator (2), a 

photodetector (3), and an arithmetic unit (4). The cell 
(1), which is formed of a transparent member int
o a 
triangular shape in its cross section, has different 

optical path lengths and is to contain a sample (11) 
therein. The light irradiator (2), which comprises a 

variable-wavelength laser generator (12), and a measuring 
system (15) composed of convex lenses (13), (14), makes a 

laser beam from the variable-wavelength laser generator 
(12) enlarged in cross-sectional area greater than original 

and formed into collimated light, and makes the laser beam 
incident upon the cell (1). The photodetector (3) 

comprises a multiplicity of CCDs (16) arranged in parallel 
to the surface of the cell (1), so that it can detect 

intensity of rays of transmitted light that have traveled 
over different optical path lengths at positions of an 

equal distance from the cell (1). The arithmetic unit (4), 
receiving a signal from the individual CCDs 16, calculates 

concentrations of components in the sample (11) based on 
optimum optical path lengths for different wavelengths and 

values of transmitted light at positions of the optimum  
 

optical path lengths, and further outputs calculation 
results.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and
a method for measuring the concentrations of light-absorbing
substances in an aqueous solution. More specifically, the
invention relates to an apparatus and a method for
optically measuring the concentrations of components, which are
applicable to measurement of, for example, concentrations
of glucose and haemoglobin in blood, and concentrations of
protein, bilirubin and saccharide in urine as well as
the concentrations of components in beverages.It is well known that the relation between
concentration of a solution and light absorption can be
expressed by the following Lambert-Beer's law:
Ac=Loge(Io/It)=ΣαiCiL
where
Ac = absorbance,Io = quantity of incident light,It = quantity of transmitted light,αi = extinction coefficient of i component in
the sample, Ci = concentration of i component in the sample,
andL = optical path length within the cell
containing the sample.With regard to this equation, the concentration
can be determined by performing multivariate analysis based
on measured values of quantity of transmitted light on
multiple wavelengths.Since the concentrations of each component is
determined based on measured values obtained by a measuring
system, the accuracy of the concentration is limited by the
measurement accuracy of the measuring system. Therefore,
to determine the concentrations of components, particularly
accurate concentrations of trace amounts of components out
of the components to be measured, the measuring system is
required to have an enhanced accuracy of measurement.
Thus, the accuracy of the concentrations determined has a
close relation to the S/N ratio of the measuring system.Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication JP-A-63-144237
discloses a method for measuring
absorbances and an apparatus for the same, which are
applicable to quantitative determination of trace amounts
of organic and inorganic components in a sample solution.This apparatus comprises a cell for a
spectrophotometer having different cell lengths (i.e., 
optical path lengths, which herein mean distances over
which light travels within a cell), a feeder for feeding a
sample solution to the cell, a switching unit for switching
over the optical path length, and a controller for
controlling the feeder and the switching unit. According
to this apparatus, measurement of absorbances of sample
solutions is carried out based on the quantity of
transmitted light at a portion of the cell corresponding to
the short optical path length for high concentration
samples or the
