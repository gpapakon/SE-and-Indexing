<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pressure-sensitive adhesive and
a pressure-sensitive adhesive tape prepared therefrom which shows excellent
adhesion to solid acidic surfaces such as acidic non-melamine crosslinked,
acid-rain resistant automotive paints.Automobile body side molding and emblems are usually
permanently mounted to exterior automobile surfaces either by mechanical
fasteners or by pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes having a foamlike or foam core
and relatively thin pressure-sensitive adhesive top layers or coatings. These
exterior mounting tapes must not only strongly adhere to the protective and
decorative automotive coatings and finishes, but must also withstand the
environmental and mechanical stresses encountered by automobiles.Typical foam and foamlike cores include filled or unfilled
commercially available crosslinked polyethylene, polyurethane,
polychloroprene, or acrylate foams. Acrylic copolymers, due to in part to their
ease of formulation and weathering stability, are commonly the
pressure-sensitive adhesives coated on such cores. These acrylic
pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) generally comprise a primary component of
acrylate or methacrylate monomer or a combination of such monomers which,
when polymerized, have a low glass transition temperature (Tg). These soft,
tacky low Tg monomers are copolymerized with a secondary component
consisting of high Tg monomers, usually polar monomers such as acrylic acid,
methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, acrylamide, methacrylamide, and mixtures
thereof. As described in U.S. Patent No. Re 24,906
   when such polar monomers are incorporated with a predominance
of low Tg monomers, a sufficiently tacky pressure-sensitive adhesive is formed
having high cohesive or internal strength. Further increases in internal or
cohesive strength (i.e., shear strength), which are often required to resist the
severe environmental and chemical conditions found in automotive applications,
can be obtained through crosslinking the acrylate PSAs. These acrylate PSAs, most importantly, must adhere well to the
high solids coatings employed by automotive manufacturers and suppliers.
These coatings, formulated for appearance and hardness, are often acrylate or
methacrylate copolymers containing hydroxy functional monomers which are
subsequently crosslinked through the hydroxy functionalities in an acid
catalyzed reaction using melamine curing agents. Due to the high melamine
concentration of such coatings, they tend to have a basic character which
enhances the adhesion
