<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a system for processing compressed image data arriving in packets, these packets being separated by headers comprising parameters. A memory bus (MBUS) is managed by a memory controller (24) in order to exchange data between processing elements and an image memory (15). A pipeline circuit (11, 12, 13) comprises several processing elements and a parameter bus (VLDBUS) serves to supply packets to be processed to the pipeline circuit as well as parameters to elements of the pipeline circuit. This parameter bus is managed by a circuit VLD which receives compressed data from the memory bus and which comprises a header detector in order to supply the parameters to the elements of the pipeline circuit and to other elements of the system which require them.

The system of claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that

a transfer of data between two elements connected to the
memory bus (MBUS) corresponds to a specific task that is

initiated or continued when one of the two elements

possible tasks being concurrent tasks that are carried

out by the memory controller (24) according to a task

through the memory bus when its content reaches a lower
limit, and
a read-only buffer memory being filled by the associated
element and issuing a request to provide data on the

memory bus when its content reaches an upper limit.
The system of claim 4, 
characterized in that
