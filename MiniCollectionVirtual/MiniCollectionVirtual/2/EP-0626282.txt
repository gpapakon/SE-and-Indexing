<ABSTRACT>
The invention applies to the field of windows, and 
more precisely relates to a rotatingly openable 

closure element (3) assembly for a window, wherein 
the closure element (3) is of a same shape as that 

of a curvedaperture in the window, said closure 
element (3) being pivoted at a vertex of the 

curved aperture at a horizontal axis (4) 
perpendicular to the closure element (3). Means 

for manually or electrically activating a rotation 
of the closure element (3) about the horizontal 

axis (4) are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a rotatingly openable 
closure element assembly in a window. The invention is particularly but not exclusively 
applicable in the field of motor vehicle windows 
and semicircular windows used in building and 
typical of penthouses and attics. Generally speaking there are three ways of opening 
windows presently fitted on motor vehicles: 
by vertical translation of the window which 
inserts in a chamber made in the vehicle door; 
translation can be done manually using a special 
handle, or by an electric motor; by horizontal translation of a portion of a 
window, which moves parallel to a fixed portion of 
the same window; the translation is performed 
manually by operating a knob which unblocks 
contemporaneously a friction element inserted 
between the fixed and the mobile windows portions; by rotation by a few degrees of a window or a  
 
portion of a window about a vertical axis, 
generally externalwise of the vehicle: this 
technique is widely used for back windows or for 
small deflector windows of motor vehicles. The most widely-used window is the first above 
type, although it presents some drawbacks such as 
a need for extra space in the car for the lever 
mechanisms, whether electric or manual, and a 
fairly high final cost. A principal aim of the present invention is to 
obviate the above-mentioned drawbacks and in 
particular to provide a cheaper window with 
opening lever mechanisms which are smaller overall 
and extremely simple. A further aim is to provide a window that can be 
applied not only in the field of motor vehicles, 
but also in the construction industry for 
semicircular windows, security windows for offices 
and cabins, and in general for cabins. The 
invention also finds application in the nautical 
field. The set aims are fully achieved by the window of 
the invention, which is provided with a rotatably 
opening part and is characterised as specified in 
the following claims.  Further characteristics and advantages of the 
present invention will better emerge from the 
detailed description that follows, of an 
embodiment of the invention, illustrated in the 
form of a non-limiting example in the accompanying 
drawings, in which: 
figure 1 shows a frontal view of a door of a truck 
with the window mounted, and in a closed 
configuration; figure 2 shows the window of figure 1 in an open 
configuration; figure 3 shows a detail of the seal gasket taken 
along line III-III of figure 1; figure 4 shows a detail of the seal gasket 
according to line IV-IV of

<CLAIMS>
A rotatingly openable closure element assembly in 
a window, characterised in that it comprises: 

a frame (1) exhibiting an aperture (2); 
a closure element (3) having a same shape as the 

aperture (2) and pivoted at a vertex of the 
closure element (3), and able to rotate about an 

axis (4) perpendicular to a lie plane of the 
closure element (3), which axis (4) corresponds to 

a position of the vertex; 
means for rotating the closure element (3) about 

the axis (4). 
A rotatingly openable assembly in a window, 
characterised in that it comprises: 

a frame (1) exhibiting an aperture (2) having a 
circular section; 

a closure element (3) having a same shape as the 
aperture (2) and being pivoted at a vertex of said 

aperture (2), and being able to rotate about a 
horizontal axis (4) situated at the vertex and 

perpendicular to a lie plane of the closure 
 

element (3); 
means for rotating the closure element (3) about 

the horizontal axis (4). 
An assembly as in claim 2, characterised in that 
the angle of the circular section of the aperture 

(2) and the closure element (3) is about 90 
degrees. 
An assembly as in claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the means for a manual rotation of the 

closure element (3) about the axis (4) comprise a 
knob (8), solid to the closure element (3), which 

is provided with a pivot (7) which inserts in 
special holes (6) made in the frame (1); means for 

opposing said rotation being situated between the 
closure element (3) and the frame (1) at a 

rotation pivot (13) corresponding to the axis (4). 
An assembly as in claim 2, characterised in that a 
gasket (5) is provided, being solid to the fram
e 
(1) and developing along a semicircumferential 

line coinciding with the curve described by the 
closure element (3) when said closure element (3) 

is rotated about the axis (4) coinciding with the 
center of said semicircumferential. 
An assembly as in claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the means for rotating the closure element 

(3) about the horizontal axis (4) comprise an 
electric motor (20) which activates a worm wheel 

(19) enmeshing with a cogwheel (18) keyed on a 
pivot (13) solid to the closure element (3) at the 

axis (4). 
An assembly as in claim 2, characterised in that 
it comprises a rack (23) associated to the frame 

(1); at least one lever mechanism (25) enmeshing 
with the rack (23) for permitting and blocking a 

rotating of the closure element (3) with respect 
to said rack (23). 
An assembly as in claim 7, wherein the rack (23) 
exhibits fishtooth cogs and comprises two zones 

(23a, 23b), the cogs in one of the zones being 
symmetrical with respect to the cogs in the other 

of the zones. 
An assembly as in claim 2, characterised in that 
the means for manually rotating the closure 

element (3) about the axis (4) comprise two cables 
 

(26) acting on respective lever mechanisms (25) 
which command a blocking or enable a sliding of 

the closure element (3).
