<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the bleaching of fabrics
and to pretreatment compositions for fabrics.The bleaching of fabrics is extensively discussed in the
art. Various bleaching compositions have been designed for
this purpose, which can be classified in two classes:
peroxide bleaching compositions and hypochlorite bleaching
compositions. Peroxide bleaching has the advantage over
hypochlorite bleaching that it is generally regarded as
safer to the color of fabrics and as non-yellowing on white
fabrics.A major drawback of peroxygen bleaches is that they are
less active than chlorine bleaches at low temperatures
which are often encountered in modern laundering
operations. Thus peroxygen bleach activators have been
developed which have been extensively addressed in the art.
A particular class of peroxygen bleach activators is 
constituted by peracid precursors which react with hydrogen
peroxide to form peracids which are the activated bleaching
species.Treatments of fabrics before they are washed, often
referred to as fabric pretreatments are also known in the
art. In these pretreatments, an effective quantity of a
given liquid or pasty composition is applied onto a portion
of the fabrics, typically the heavily soiled portions,
before the fabrics are washed in an aqueous wash liquor.It has now been found that a particularly effective
bleaching of fabrics can be achieved in connection with a
pretreatment operation, provided a liquid or pasty
composition is used which comprises acetyl triethyl citrate
as a peracid precursor.Acetyl triethyl citrate has been disclosed as a peracid
precursor in the context of laundry bleaching in
WO-A-93/12067, published on 24.06.93, and EP-A-598 170, published on 25.05.94.The present invention is a process of bleaching fabrics
which comprises the steps of applying on at least a portion
of said fabrics an effective amount of a liquid or pasty
composition comprising acetyl triethyl citrate, then
washing said fabrics in an aqueous wash liquor, wherein an
effective amount of hydrogen peroxide is provided either in
said liquid or pasty composition, or in said wash liquor.The present invention involves the use of a liquid or pasty
composition comprising acetyl triethyl citrate. By liquid
or pasty, it is meant herein a composition which can be 
conveniently applied on fabrics before the fabrics are
washed. Ideally, the compositions for use in the process
of the present invention should not be so thick as to be
difficult to apply on fabrics, or so thin as to compromise
on the

amount of hydrogen peroxide is provided by said

composition.
A process according to the preceding claims wherein said
composition is applied to soiled portions of said

fabrics.
A process according to the preceding claims wherein said
composition is left to act on said fabrics for about 2

min to 20 min before said fabrics are washed in said
wash liquor.
The use of acetyl triethyl citrate for the manufacture
of a
 liquid or pasty composition for use in the
process according to any of the preceding claims.
