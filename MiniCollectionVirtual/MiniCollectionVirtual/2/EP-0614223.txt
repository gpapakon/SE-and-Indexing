<ABSTRACT>
To protect the thin tunnel oxide layer (8a) 
interposed between the floating gate region (6) of 

memory cells (1) and the substrate (2) and subject to 
in-process damage when the wafer is subjected to 

radiation, provision is made for a diode (D) connected 
between the control gate region (7) of the cells and the 

substrate (1). The diode (D) defines a conductive path 
which, when normal operating voltage is applied to the 

control gate regions (7), is turned off and has no 
effect on normal operation of the memory (15), and which 

is turned on to permit the passage of charges between 
the control gate region (7) and the substrate (2) when 

the control gate potential exceeds normal operating 
potential but is less than the breakdown voltage of the 

tunnel oxide (8a) divided by the coupling factor of the 
control and floating gate regions of the cells. The 

diode (D) is appropriately formed prior to patterning 
the control gate regions of the cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nonvolatile
EPROM, EEPROM or FLASH-EEPROM memory with tunnel oxide
protection.Though applicable to all the above types of
memory, the present invention is particularly
advantageous in the case of flash-EEPROM memories to
which special reference is made in the following
description.Flash-EEPROM memories are Electrically Erasable
Programmable Read Only Memories (EEPROMs) which combine
the high density and low cost of EPROMs with the
advantage of electrical erasability, and have recently
become the most attractive of nonvolatile memories for
their potential application in solid state disks for
portable computers.Though various flash memory concepts have been
developed, most flash memories employ a very thin (8-12
nm) oxide layer through which each memory cell may be 
programmed and erased by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, and
which is therefore known as the "tunnel oxide."The following description deals with the most
commonly used flash-EEPROM cell structure, the double-poly
single-transistor cell, though the present
invention applies to any cell structure employing tunnel
oxide.Double-poly single-transistor flash cells present
a structure closely resembling that of standard EPROM
cells, and comprise an NMOS transistor with a
polysilicon floating gate region capacitively coupled to
a second polysilicon layer defining a control gate. The
main difference between these two types of cell lies in
the thickness of the oxide between the floating gate
region and the substrate, which is much thinner in the
case of flash cells.For the sake of clarity, a description will now be
given of a flash-EEPROM cell with reference to the cross
section shown in Fig.1.Number 1 in Fig.1 indicates a flash-EPROM cell
formed, in this case, in a P type substrate 2 housing N+
type source and drain regions 3 and 4 separated by a
channel region 5 formed by the substrate itself. Over
substrate 2, aligned with channel 5, there are provided
a floating gate region 6, fully embedded in an oxide
layer 8, and a control gate region 7. Floating gate
region 6 is separated from the substrate by a thin oxide
layer 8a; control gate region 7 is separated from 
floating gate region 6 by a dielectric layer 8b; and
source region 3 presents a graded junction with the
substrate, that is, is formed in two parts: a heavily
doped (N+) part 3a facing the larger surface 10 of the
substrate; and a deeper, lightly doped (N-) part 3b
surrounding part 3a on the sides not facing surface 10.The yield and reliability of flash memories
