<ABSTRACT>
A target is irradiated with a laser beam having an 
energy of hν/n, where n is an integer, instead of the 

photon energy hν required for a reaction to proceed using a 
conventional single-photon excitation method. A desired 

reaction is selectively induced by the absorption of 
multiple photons instead of single photons. It is thus 

possible to induce a photoreaction in which an absorption is 
carried out in accordance with a selection theory different 

from that of single-photon absorption, and which is quite 
different from a photoreaction induced by a single-photon 

excitation. Namely, a target or reactant is irradiated with 
a photon energy hν₂ having a wavelength integral times 

longer than that of the photon energy hν₁ necessary for a 
photoreaction to proceed. Photon energy hν₂ is either used 

in place of the photon energy hν₁ necessary for a 
photoreaction, or together with the photon energy hν₁, to 

thereby make the reactant absorb the energy equal to the 
photon energy hν₁. The method is capable of selectively 

and preferentially inducing a specific photoreaction among 
various possible, concurrent photoreactions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of controlling a 
photoreaction with a laser beam, and more particularly to a 
method of controlling the photoexcitation of irradiated 
substances. A laser beam is, like an electron beam and X-rays, 
one of the electromagnetic waves. Considering the laser 
beam to be made up of particles (photons), the energy of 
light is represented by the photon energy hν which is a 
product of the frequency ν of the light and Planck's 
constant h. In so-called single-photon excitation, the 
photon energy hν is supplied by monochromatic light having 
a frequency ν, whereas in so-called multi-photon 
excitation, the photon energy hν is supplied by 
monochromatic light having a frequency ν/n where n is an 
integer greater than or equal to two. The photochemical reactions generated by laser beams 
have been utilized so far in surface treatment, purification 
and chemical synthesis. Since the photon energy hν ranging 
from the ultraviolet spectrum to the vacuum ultraviolet 
spectrum is larger than the bond energy between atoms, it is 
possible to induce photo-dissociation and photoreaction of 
the reactant gas molecules by irradiating them with an 
ultraviolet laser. Thus, it is possible, by a reaction in 
which photo-dissociation and photoreaction are induced by 
irradiating a reactant with the photon energy hν, to 
achieve a number of desired objectives. These objectives  
 
include: the synthesis of chemical compounds such as 
medicines and other products of chemical synthesis, the 
synthesis of substances from which optical materials can be 
manufactured, the control of gas-phase CVD reactions, the 
micro-machining surface treatment of various materials by 
using solid-phase photoreactions, the formation of thin 
films by using laser CVD, and reforming of surface layers 
such as laser doping. However, the above photoreactions are generally 
complex and vary greatly. Hence the control of these 
reactions is difficult. Accordingly, it has heretofore been 
difficult to selectively control the synthesis of materials 
by using the photoreactions, or to control micro-machining 
surface treatments by using the photorchemical processes. 
In conventional photoreaction methods, only single-photon 
photoexcitation has been utilized, wherein the photon energy 
hν is supplied through a monochromatic light having a 
frequency ν. In the single-photon photoreaction, in order 
to control the photoreaction it is necessary to: (a) 
control the wavelength of the light, (b) control the 
temperature, (c)
