<ABSTRACT>
A flat display comprises an address current 

detecting means (3) for detecting a value of address 
current consumed for each frame to be displayed on the 

flat display, a comparator (4) for comparing the address 
current value detected by the address current detecting 

means (3) with a given reference value, and an address 
frequency control means (5) for controlling address 

frequencies related to a display frame in response to the 
output of the comparator (4) so as to restrict the power 

used for addressing purposes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to flat displays, for
example plasma displays or electroluminescent (EL)
displays.Flat displays including plasma displays and
electroluminescent (EL) displays have small depths.
Moreover, flat displays permit the construction of large
display screens. The application range and production
scale of flat displays are therefore rapidly expanding
and an address current suppressing means may be desirable
for use in a brightness drive utilized in such a display.In general, a flat display utilizes a change
accumulated between electrodes and causes a discharge to
emit light for display. For better understanding of the
general principle of display, the structure and operation
of, for example, a plasma display will be described
briefly.A previously-considered plasma display (AC
type PDP) can be a dual-electrode type that uses two
electrodes for selective discharge (addressing discharge)
and sustaining discharge or a triple-electrode type that
uses three electrodes for addressing discharge.In a plasma display (PDP) for a color display,
infrared rays resulting from discharge are used to excite
phosphors formed in discharge cells. The phosphors are
susceptible to the impact of ions or positive charge
induced by the discharge. The above dual-electrode type
has a structure that the phosphors directly hit ions.
This structure may reduce the service lives of phosphors.To avoid the deterioration, the color plasma
display usually employs the triple-electrode structure 
based on surface discharge.The triple-electrode type falls into an
arrangement in which the third electrode is formed on the
substrate on which first and second electrodes thereof
for sustaining discharge are arranged and an arrangement
in which a third electrode is formed on another substrate
opposed to the one on which first and second electrodes
are arranged.In the arrangement in which three electrodes
are formed on the same substrate, the third electrode may
be placed on or under the two electrodes for sustaining
discharge.Furthermore, visible light emitted from
phosphors may be transmitted or reflected by the
phosphors for observation.The foregoing plasma displays of different
types have the same principle. Mention will therefore be
made of a flat display in which first and second
electrodes for sustaining discharge are formed on a first
substrate and a third electrode is formed on a second
substrate opposed to the first substrate.Fig. 6 is a schematic plan view showing a
configuration of a triple-electrode type
