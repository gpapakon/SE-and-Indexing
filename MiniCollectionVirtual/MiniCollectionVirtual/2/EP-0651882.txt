<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an apparatus and method for determining a property of a sample, derived from a response obtained from the sample after an electrical pulse has been applied to it. In a preferred embodiment blood cells (224) are subjected to an electrical pulse (figure 3c),  a response (figure 3d) is obtained using data retrieval means and a Fourier Transform is applied to the response. As the pulse (202) applied is of very short duration (ideally a Dirac pulse) the Fourier Transform yields information across a very broad bandwidth, typically several MHz, and accordingly a wide range of frequency response data is obtained. Certain cellular defects can be deduced from the transformed data. In a preferred embodiment detection means (204, 206) is provided to precisely detect the presence of a cell (224) as it passes through a particular region of an orifice (220). This is then used to trigger the pulse at a precisely controlled instant. This reduces the effect of random dispersion and can be adapted to ignore noise peaks which inevitably occur. The invention may be operated continuously and provides information across a bandwidth which is wider than was previously possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to a method of and
apparatus for determining an electrical property of a sample and
more particularly to a method of and apparatus for determining
the impedance of particles such as biological cells (for example,
white or red blood cells).An increased awareness of the altered cell structure in
vascular diseases and cancers has led to the development of
techniques for the analysis of cell structure parameters.
Changes in the characteristics of the cell membrane or nucleus
are characteristic of several disorders. It has been found that
the electrical properties of a cell can provide details of the
composition and dimensions of the cell and more particularly of
changes in the characteristics of the cell membrane and nucleus.
Electrical activity in cells is due to the exchange of ions
across cell membranes, which gives rise to potential differences
and characteristic impedances. An advantage of determining the
properties of cells from their electrical characteristics is that
the characteristics of individual cells can be determined.It is known from a paper by Schmukler, R. et al. ("A New
Transient Technique for Measurement of Isolated Cell Impedance",
Proc. 10th N.E. Bioenging. Conf., IEEE Press, 213-216) to
determine the impedance characteristics of blood cells by
embedding them in a polycarbonate filter, applying a current step
stimulus to the system including the filter and cells embedded
therein, and detecting the transient response to the step. The
impedance characteristics (and hence various properties of the
cells)are then determined from the transient response.This known technique suffers from the drawbacks firstly that
data processing of the transient response to a step stimulus can
be complicated, secondly that it does not permit continuous tests
to be carried out on a population of cells, and thirdly that it
is time-consuming and expensive (in particular, the filter
requires frequent replacement). Thus the technique is basically 
a laboratory technique, incapable of use in clinical tests.International Patent Application WO 88/03267 describes a
device which uses multiple AC sources to determine impedance of a
sample at several frequencies. The orifice through which the
samples flows, forms part of the oscillator tuning circuit.
Therefore the oscillator output is dependant upon the orifice
impedance. To allow multiple oscillators and a DC current source
a novel method of coupling to the orifice must be used. The
device described suffers from two main drawbacks.
