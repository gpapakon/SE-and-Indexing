<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the oxidation of a
primary or secondary alcohols to aldehydes or ketones, respectively,
and for the oxidation of 1,2-diols to α-ketols or α-diketones.According to a further embodiment of the present invention, this
process is also suited for selectively oxidizing to aldehydes or ketones
primary or secondary alcohols containing other easily oxidizable
groups, such as amino or thioether groups and easily oxidizable
heterocycles, which remain wholly unchanged throughout the
oxidation process.The oxidation of alcoholic group to aldehyde and ketone is a useful
reaction in organic chemistry and several methods are known,
covering a variety of experimental conditions, (general reference: J.
March Advanced Organic Chemistry 4° Ed., J. Wiley 1992, pg. 1159-1205).
The most widely utilised oxidants are CrO3 and KMnO4, which,
however, present serious drawbacks. Oxidations with CrO3 are
performed in a highly acidic medium, thus acid sensitive compounds
can not be oxidized by this reagent. Moreover the isolation of the
oxidized products from the soluble chromium-containing by-products
brings about complex problems and usually a chromatographic
method is necessary to make sure that the desired oxidized products
are free of chromium pollutants.KMnO4 oxidations are mainly performed in a basic medium, thus
base sensitive compounds can not be oxidized by this reagent.
Moreover KMnO4 oxidations must be performed at a temperature 
above room temperature (from 50 to 80 °C), thus preventing the use
of KMnO4 for selective oxidation of polifunctionals substrates.In particular, both CrO3 and KMnO4 are not suitable for the
oxidation of 1,2-diols because, instead of oxidizing them to α-ketols
or α-diketones, they mainly, if not exclusively, cause the cleavage of
the C-C bond (J. March, loc. cit. 1174; Corey E. J. and Kim C. U.,
Tetrahedron Lett. 1974, 287 and references therein cited).Indeed few methods are available for the oxidation of 1,2-diols to
α-ketols or α-diketones, and all suffer from serious drawbacks.For example, same methods require rigorously anhydrous reaction
conditions (Corey E. J. and Kim C. U. loc. cit.; Schobert R. Synthesis1987, 741; Christl M. and Kraft A., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl.1988,
27, 1369; Magnus P., Mendoza J. S., Stamford A., Ladlow M., Willis P. J.
Am. Chem. Soc.1992, 114, 10232), while other use expensive
oxidants such as silver salts (Fetizon M., Golfier M. Louis J-M.,
Mourges P., Tetrahedron Lett.1972, 4445) or
