<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a measuring scale support for photo electric length or angle measuring systems. On the measuring scale support, a scale in the form of a phase grating is formed which exhibits alternately raised areas (52) and stepped-down areas (53). On one side of a base body (51) with step-shaped structure, a continuous compensation layer (55) of Cr and on this, in turn, a continuous highly reflective layer (54) of TiN is applied. The material and the layer thickness of the compensation layer (55) is selected in such a manner that it counteracts the mechanical stresses of the reflecting surface layer (54) and thus the applied layers (54, 55) do not exert any stresses on the base body (51) in the completed state of the measuring scale support.

<CLAIMS>
Support for a measuring scale for a length or angle 
measuring system operating in incident light, in which a 

plurality of continuous layers (4,5;24,25;34,35;54,55;64,65) 
are present on one side of a basic member (1,21,31,51,61), 

characterised in that at least one of these layers is a 
continuous reflective layer (4,24,34,54,64), and there is 

present between this reflective layer (4,24,34,54,64) and the 
basic member (1,21,31,51,61) a continuous compensating layer 

(5,25,35,55,65), the layers (4,5;24,25;34,35;54,55;64,65) 
having different physical properties and the layer material 

and the layer thicknesses being so determined that mechanical 
tensions caused in the layers (4,5;24,25;34,35;54,55;64,65) 

are compensated. 
Support for a measuring scale according to claim 1, 
characterised in that there are present on a surface of the 

basic member (1) the compensating layer (5), thereupon the 
reflective layer (4) and again thereupon absorbent areas (3) 

which are partially spaced apart from one another. 
Support for a measuring scale according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the layers (24,25) comprise a 

physically inhomogeneous layer (27) which exerts no tensions 
on the basic member (21).  

 
Support for a measuring scale according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the inhomogeneous layer (27) has at 

least one layer area (25) of titanium and one layer area (24) 
of titanium nitride. 
Support for a measuring scale according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the scale (32,33;52,53;62,63) is a 

phase grid. 
Support for a measuring scale according to claim 5, 
characterised in that there are present on one surface of the 

basic member (31) webs (36) spaced apart from one another, in 
that the continuous compensation layer (35) is applied 

thereupon, and the continuous reflective layer (34) is in 
turn applied thereupon. 
Support for a measuring scale according to claim 5, 
characterised in that the basic member (51) is stepped in 

configuration, the continuous compensation layer (35) being 
applied thereupon, and the continuous reflective layer (54) 

is applied thereupon. 
Support for a measuring scale according to claim 5, 
characterised in that upon one surface of the basic member  

 
(61) there is applied the continuous compensating layer (65), 

thereupon the continuous reflective layer (64), thereupon a 
transparent layer (68), and thereupon individual reflective 

webs (62) spaced apart from each other. 
Support for a measuring scale according to one of claims 
1, 2 or 5 to 8, characterised in that the reflective layer 

(4,34,54,64) is a titanium nitride layer, and.the 
compensating layer (5,35,55,65) is a chromium layer;
