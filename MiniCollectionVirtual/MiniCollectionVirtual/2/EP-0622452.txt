<ABSTRACT>
A method for post-cleaning finish drying is provided, 
by which finish drying of industrial parts can be conducted 

without leaving residues or corroding the cleaned material. 
In this method, finish drying can be performed without the 

use of flon being a cause of destruction of the ozono-sphere. 
Preferably, a cleaned material is dipped (rinsed) 

in a low molecular weight siloxane having a content of 
organic compounds, such as dodecamethylpentasiloxane, of 

less than 0.01 % by weight, taken out and dried. Also, 
preferably, the material rinsed with the low molecular 

weight siloxane is subjected to a vapor cleaning using a 
perfluorocarbon compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
finish drying to be conducted in a final
step subsequent to cleaning of industrial parts, in
which finish drying of industrial parts, e.g., optical
and molded parts composed of glass or plastic, metallic
parts, ceramic parts and electronic parts, upon cleaning
can be performed without causing the parts to have
stain and residue, so that the industrial parts having
undergone the finish drying can be directly fed to
surface treatment, e.g., formation of a vacuum deposition
film on the surface of the parts. In particular,
the present invention is concerned with the method in
which finish drying can be accomplished without the use
of flon, the reduction of the use thereof being worldwide
demanded in recent years.Generally, for industrial parts, such as optical,
molded and electronic parts, finish drying is performed
after precision cleaning thereof for defatting. This
post-cleaning finish drying has been performed by the
vapor drying using 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane
(flon 113). The flon 113 has predominantly
been used because it is incombustible, has low 
toxicity to organisms, can rapidly be dried and exhibits
selective dissolving power (fats and oils are
effectively dissolved while polymeric materials, such
as plastic and rubber, are not corroded).However, flon 113 (and other perhaloethanes) are
so chemically stable that the life thereof in the
troposphere is long. Thus, flon 113 is diffused into
the stratosphere, where it is decomposed by sunbeams to
produce halogen radicals. The halogen radicals incur
chain reaction with ozone to thereby destroy the ozonosphere.
Therefore, the reduction of the use of flon
113 is strongly demanded. In accordance with the
demand for the reduction of the use of flon 113 for the
protection of the ozonosphere, proposals have been made
to carry out finish drying by the use of a large variety
of solvent mixtures and azeotropic compositions.
For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application
Publication No.1-318094 (1989) discloses a solvent composed
of a mixture of flon 113, isopropyl alcohol and
methyl ethyl ketone. Japanese Unexamined Patent Application
Publication No.2-289693 (1990) discloses azeotropic
compositions comprising dichlorotetrafluoropropane
(flon 234) and an aliphatic lower alcohol, such as
ethanol. Further, the finish drying using the vapor of
isopropyl alcohol (IPA) is disclosed. However, the mixture disclosed in Japanese Unexamined
Patent Application Publication No.1-318094 (1989)
contains flon 113 as
