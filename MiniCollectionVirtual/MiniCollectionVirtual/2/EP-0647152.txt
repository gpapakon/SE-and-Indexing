<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a probe for heating body tissue by means of high-intensity laser light, the probe having an optical fibre coupled to a laser source and a diffusor element located in the light-exit zone which is inserted into the body tissue. The diffusor element is made of a material which is highly transparent to the laser light but which contains highly reflective particles embedded in it. The probe is connected to a coolant circuit to cool the light-exit zone.

A probe for heating body tissue by high-intensity laser 
light, said probe comprising a light guide (102; 1; 11; 

21) which can be coupled to a laser light source (101), 
and a diffusor element (103; 3; 13; 23) arranged at the 

light exit portion of said light guide adapted to be introduced 
into the body tissue, wherein said diffusor element 

is made of a base material highly transparent to the 
laser light and highly reflective material particles embedded 

therein, said probe further comprising an outer 
sleeve (4; 14, 18; 24) which surrounds the light guide 

(102; 1; 11; 21) at a distance and which can be connected 
to a coolant circuit, 
characterized
 in that said outer 
sleeve (4; 14, 18; 24) surrounds said diffusor element 

(103; 3; 13; 23) at a distance and is made of a material 
which is transparent and has good heat conductivity at 

least in the area of said diffusor element (103; 3; 13; 
23).

characterized
 
in that said light guide (21) is hollow, and that said 

diffusor element (23) is porous such that the cavity of 
the light guide (21) and the space between said light 

guide and said outer sleeve (24) form a passageway (22) 
for the coolant. 
A probe according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized
 
in that said outer sleeve (4) is divided into at least 

two channels (5, 6) by a membrane (9) extending in parallel
