<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to dye-transfer-inhibiting detergent 
compositions comprising a polymer selected from polyamine N-oxide 

containing polymers which contain units having the following structural 
formula: 


wherein P is a polymerisable unit, whereto the N-O group can be 
attached or wherein the N-O group forms part of the polymerisable unit 

or a combination of both. 

R are aliphatic, ethoxylated aliphatics, aromatic, heterocyclic or 
alicyclic groups or any combination thereof whereto the nitrogen of the 

N-O group can be attached or wherein the nitrogen of the N-O group forms 
part of these groups,

 
and a clay softening system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to detergent compositions 
containing a clay-softening system. More in particular, the 
present invention relates to dye transfer inhibiting 
compositions comprising polyamine N-oxide containing polymers 
and a clay-softening system. Clays, in particular smectite clays are known fabric-softening 
agents, and their use in fabric-softening through the 
wash has been disclosed in the art. The relative ability of the softening clays to meet various 
performance criteria is among others depending on the presence 
of adjunct detergent ingredients. As a consequence, the 
detergent formulator is faced with a difficult task of 
providing detergent compositions which have an excellent 
overall performance.  One of the types of adjunct detergent ingredients that is 
added to detergent compositions are dye transfer inhibiting 
polymers. Said polymers are added to detergent compositions in 
order to inhibit the transfer of dyes from colored fabrics onto 
other fabrics washed therewith. These polymers have the ability 
to complex or adsorb the fugitive dyes washed out of dyed 
fabrics before the dyes have the opportunity to become attached 
to other articles in the wash. Polymers have been used within detergent compositions to 
inhibit dye transfer.
 
Examples of such polymers are vinylpyrrolidone polymers such as 
described EP-A-265 257 and EP 508 034.
 
Unfortunately, said vinylpyrrolidone polymers tend to interact 
with the clays formulated therewith. Accordingly, the dye 
transfer inhibiting performance of the polymers and the 
softening performance of the clays are negatively affected. It has now been found that polyamine N-oxide containing 
polymers are very compatible with clays in that the dye 
transfer inhibiting performance of the polyamine N-oxide 
containing polymers is not negatively affected in the presence 
of clays. In addition, it has been found that the softening 
performance of clays formulated with polyamine N-oxide 
containing polymers has been maintained. This finding allows us to formulate detergent compositions 
which have both excellent dye transfer inhibiting properties 
and softening performance. According to another embodiment of this invention a process 
is also provided for laundering operations involving colored 
fabrics. Copending European Patent Application N° 92202168.8 describes 
polyamine N-oxide containing polymers which are very efficient 
in eliminating transfer of solubilized or suspended dyes. The present invention relates to inhibiting dye
