<ABSTRACT>
Sheet glass (1) is provided with two low 
emissivity coatings (10,11) to provide lower heat 

transmission characteristics. The glass can be used in 
insulated glazing units. Preferably, one coating (10) is a 

hard coating and the other coating (11) is on the other 
surface of the glass sheet (1) and is a sputter coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to coated sheet glass and 
to insulated glazing units containing such sheet glass. Insulated glazing units (sometimes called sealed 
double glazing units) comprise two sheets of glass spaced in 
face-to-face relation and hermetically sealed in a frame, 
the gap between the sheets being small and usually 
containing dry air or another gas. The principal feature of 
these units is that they have a much lower "U" factor (heat 
transmission factor) than a single sheet of glass and yet 
can be fixed in a window or door frame in essentially the 
same way. The heat-loss characteristics of these units can 
be further improved by using, for one of the glass sheets, a 
sheet having a low emissivity coating thereon. Sheet glass 
having a low emissivity coating thereon is commercially 
available (e.g. Pilkington "K" float glass). One such 
coating is formed by directing a reactant gas against the 
exposed surface of the glass sheet as it is formed in the 
float process (see GB-A-2227754 and 1507996). In such 
glass, the coating is hard and pyrolytic, and can only be 
formed on one side of the sheet. Another way of making low 
emissivity glass is to coat a sheet of glass by cathode 
sputtering targets containing various metals such as indium 
and tin (GB-A-2116590, 2138026 and EP 0229921). The 
coatings formed in this way are relatively soft and are only 
formed on one side of the sheet. A further way of making  
 
low emissivity coatings on glass is to coat the glass with a 
powder and then heat to react. This is not a very 
satisfactory technique since it is difficult to avoid uneven 
coating thicknesses. Insulated glazing units are known which contain 
one sheet of a low-emissivity coated glass. The coating is 
most preferably positioned inside the unit (i.e. on one of 
the inward-facing glass surfaces), preferably on the sheet 
which is towards the inside of the building in which the 
unit is mounted. It is also known to provide a second 
coating on a sheet of low emmisivity glass, in order to 
provide other effects. For example, GB-A-2097456 describes 
glass with a low emissivity coating on one face and a solar 
control coating on the other face. In recent times, there has been a requirement to 
provide glass units of even lower "U" value than previously. 
In response to this, thicker low emissivity coatings have 
been employed, usually comprising silver. The use of these 
thicker coatings has lowered the "U" values of glazing 
units, but at the same time it has reduced the light 
transmis

<CLAIMS>
An insulated glazing unit which comprises two 
glass sheets (1,2) held in spaced facing relationship, one 

sheet (1) having a first low emissivity coating (10) on one 
surface (7) thereof, characterised in that said one sheet 

(1) also has a second low emissivity coating (11) thereon. 
A unit according to claim 1, wherein the two low 
emissivity coatings (10,11) are on opposite sides of the 

said sheet (1). 
A unit according to claim 1 or 2, wherein one 
coating (10) is a hard coating and the other (11) is a 

sputter coating. 
A unit according to claim 3, wherein the hard 
coating is on an outer surface of the unit. 
Sheet glass (1) having a low emissivity coating 
(10,11) on both its surfaces (6,7). 
Sheet glass according to claim 5, wherein one 
coating (10) is of hard material and the other (11) is a 

sputter coating. 
A method of making sheet glass as claimed in claim 
6, which comprises sputter depositing one coating on to the 

uncoated surface of a sheet of glass which has the hard 
coating on its other surface.
