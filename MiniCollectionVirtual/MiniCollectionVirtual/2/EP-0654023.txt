<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel phenylpyrrole derivatives, processes for
their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy, in
particular as antipsychotic agents.European Patent Application No. 241053, describes compounds of the formula :

wherein A is an unsaturated 5-membered heterocyclic ring, such as 2,5-pyrrolyl, or 3,5- or
1,4-pyrazolyl; X is a nitrogen or carbon atom; R1,R2, R3 are each hydrogen or alkyl; R4
is aryl, heteroaryl, arylcarbonyl or heteroaryl-carbonyl; R is selected from a variety of
substituents and n is 0-4. The compounds are said to have antipsychotic properties.European Patent Application No. 259930 describes compounds of the formula :

wherein A is an unsaturated 5-membered heterocyclic ring, such as 2,5-pyrrolyl, 1,4-pyrazolyl
or 2,5-furyl; R is hydrogen, alkyl or optionally substituted phenyl; R1 is alkyl,
alkenyl or forms a ring with the phenyl group; R2 is hydrogen, hydroxy or alkoxy; R3 is
selected from a variety of substituents and n is 0-3. These compounds are also said to have
antipsychotic properties.We have now found a novel class of 2-phenylpyrroles which have high affinity
for dopamine D3 receptors and thus have potential as antipsychotic agents.In a first aspect the present invention provides compounds of formula (I) :

wherein 
R1 represents C1-4alkyl; andR2, R3, R4 and R5 each independently represent hydrogen, halogen, C1-4alkyl,
C1-4alkoxy, C1-4alkoxyC1-4alkyl, C1-4alkylsulphonyl, trifluoromethylsulphonyl;
