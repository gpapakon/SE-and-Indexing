<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a locking device (11) comprising a 
locking chain body (10) having a plurality of connecting members (12) 

connected to each other at a adjacent end portions (13) thereof 
through a pivot connection, including a pivot pin (15). An 

interstice (25) between adjacent surfaces (14) of the adjacent end 
portions (13) extends axially symmetrical at least in part under an 

angle or offset with respect to a main perpendicular to the 
axis of the pivot pin (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a locking device for locking, while 
parking, vehicles such as motorcycles, bicycles, etc., the 
locking device comprising a locking chain body having a plurality 
of connecting members pivotably connected to each other at 
adjacent end portions thereof through a pivot connection 
including a pivot pin. Such locking devices have been disclosed in Japanese Unexamined 
Patent Publication Sho62-59783 or in US-4,760,718. Such a locking device is provided with a locking chain body 
having a plurality of rod members arranged in longitudinal 
succession and having opposite ends of two adjacent ones of the 
rod members piled on each other and connected with each other 
through a pivot shaft pivotally relative to each other, so that, 
when the locking chain body is formed like a loop by pivoting 
these rod members, both ends of the locking chain body may be 
connectable with each other. Further, this locking device is 
provided with a lock portion for locking both ends of the locking 
chain body as connected. When intending to prevent the parked vehicle from getting stolen, 
the locking chain body above is made penetratable, for example, 
one wheel. Then this locking chain body is formed like a loop 
enclosing a fixed member of the vehicle, eg. the front fork of 
the motorcycle, or a fixed structure such as a utility pole, and 
both ends of the locking chain body are connected with each other 
and is locked with the lock portion in the connected state. Thus, the locking chain body is locked in a state with the 
vehicle wheel prevented from revolving, and the vehicle is 
prevented from getting stolen.  
 Hereupon, since both mating surfaces through which end portions of two adjacent rod 
members are piled on each other slide over each other while both rod members pivot 
relative to each other, both mating surfaces are not in close contact with each other but 
some gap required for allowing mutual pivoting of both rod members is provided between 
both mating surfaces. However, if such a gap is provided between both mating surfaces, someone attempting to 
steal the vehicle may chop the pivot chaft with a chisel driven into this gap or with a 
metal cuting saw inserted in this gap. Therefore, the locking device having such a conventional structure is not sufficient 
for securly preventing the vehicle from getting stolen. Accordingly it is an objective of the present invention to provide a 
locking device with an increased security against getting broken 
open. According to the present
