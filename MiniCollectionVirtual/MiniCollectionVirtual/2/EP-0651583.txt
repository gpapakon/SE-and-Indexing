<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motion compensator for 
digital image restoration, which restores the original digital 
image by decoding digital data compressed using the motion of 
digital image, and more particularly, to a motion compensator 
for digital image restoration, which receives data of a motion 
search area in multitude and thereby compensates for the 
motion in real time. Generally, an image decoder for protecting the compressed 
digital image data and restoring it to the original digital 
image, as shown in Fig.1, comprises an inverse quantizer 1 for 
inverse-quantizing digital data input from a variable length 
decoder (VLD), an inverse discrete cosine transformer (IDCT) 2 
for IDCT-transforming the output signal of inverse quantizer 
1, an adder 3 for adding a motion-compensated estimation 
signal of the present frame to the output signal of IDCT 2, a 
frame memory 4 for temporarily storing and outputting the 
output signal of adder 3, and a motion compensator 5 for 
estimating a motion-compensated present frame by accessing the 
preceding frame data stored in frame memory 4 and using the 
motion information output from the VLD, and thereby outputting 
the estimated result to adder 3. Roughly speaking, the image decoder inverse-quantizes the 
digital data input from the VLD in inverse quantizer 1, and 
IDCT-transforming it in IDCT 2. The result is input to adder  
 
3. Here, if the input digital data is a digital signal coded 
by motion estimation, motion compensator 5 accesses the data 
of the preceding frame stored in frame memory 4 and estimates 
the present frame where motion is compensated for according to 
the motion information output from the VLD. The estimated data 
is output to adder 3. Adder 3 adds the signal output from IDCT 2 to the signal 
output from motion compensator 5, and outputs the added result 
as a digital image of the present invention. The output 
digital image is restored in frame memory 4 for use in 
estimation of frame. Here, in the case where a macro block is used in coding 
units of motion information, i.e., motion vectors, the 
relationship between the macro block and the motion search 
area will be explained below with reference with Fig.2. Given that the size of macro block 11 is JxK, that the 
vertical search range of motion search area 12 lies within -M' 
and M, and that the horizontal search range thereof is -N' and 
N, the size of motion search area 12 becomes 
(M'+M+J)x(N'+N+K). Fig.3 is a circuit diagram of a conventional motion 
compensator 5.
