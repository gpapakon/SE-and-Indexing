<ABSTRACT>
An electronic still camera wherein an image 
compression circuit can be simplified is disclosed. The 

electronic still camera includes a lens system, a 
shutter, an image sensor and a processing circuit. A 

video signal for one frame outputted from the processing 
circuit in response to a shutter operation is written 

into a memory. A video signal read out from the memory 
is compressed in accordance with the JPEG system by an 

image compression circuit and then written into a memory 
card. The image sensor is constituted from an image 

pickup section and a product sum calculation section. A 
CMD image sensor capable of non-destructively reading 

out a picture signal is used as the image pickup 
section. The product sum calculation section performs 

DCT processing required for compression processing of 
the JPEG system. Since a picked up image signal 

processed by DCT processing is obtained from the image 
sensor, DCT processing of the image compression circuit 

is unnecessary. This can simplify the construction of 
the circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image sensor and an
electronic still camera which records an image signal
output from the image sensor onto a recording medium
such as a memory card.Electronic still cameras have such a general
construction as shown in FIG. 7. Referring to FIG. 7,
the electronic still camera shown includes a lens system
1, a shutter mechanism 2, and an image sensor 3 such as
a CCD (charge-coupled device). A picked up image signal
outputted from the image sensor 3 is supplied to a
processing circuit or camera signal processing circuit
4. The picked up image signal is processed by and
output from the processing circuit 4 in the form of
primary color signals R, G and B of red, green and blue
or in the form of a brightness signal Y and a pair of
color difference signals U and V.The shutter mechanism 2 is opened or closed by a
shutter drive circuit 6 under the control of a control
circuit 5. An image is picked up by the image sensor 3 
in response to a shutter releasing operation, and
thereupon, a video signal is outputted from the
processing circuit 4 and converted into a digital signal
by an analog to digital (A/D) converter 7, whereafter it
is supplied to a frame memory 8 which constitutes an
image memory so that the video signal for one frame is
written into the frame memory 8.Then, the video signal for one frame read out
from the frame memory 8 is compressed by an image
compression circuit 9 and then written into a memory
card 10 serving as a recording medium.Though not described above, operation of the
processing circuit 4, the frame memory 8, the image
compression circuit 9, the memory card 10 and some other
elements is controlled by the control circuit 5 while
read pulses, transfer pulses and some other pulses
required by the image sensor 3 and sampling pulses and
some other necessary timings required by the analog to
digital converter 7 are supplied from a timing generator
11.An electronic still camera of the construction
described above is disclosed in US-A-5442718 (U.S. Patent Application
Serial No. 08/114,168 filed September 1, 1993 and
assigned to the same assignee). In the image compression circuit 9, high efficiency
compression based on, for example, the JPEG system is
performed. Compression processing of the JPEG system
involves orthogonal transformation processing such as DCT
(discrete cosine transform). While such orthogonal
transformation processing is normally performed by a
digital circuit, such digital circuit is disadvantageous in
that it has a large scale since it involves
