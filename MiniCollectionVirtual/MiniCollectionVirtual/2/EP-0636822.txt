<ABSTRACT>
A ball valve comprises a housing having a fluid passage 
(4), a valve closure member (1) having curved surfaces, 

valve seating means (9) providing corresponding valve seat 
surfaces for receiving said closure member, and means for 

selectively engaging said closure member in said valve seat 
surfaces to provide for closure of said passage, wherein the 

valve seating means are adapted to be retracted from an 
operative position wherein said seat surfaces are biased 

into contact with the closure member (1) to a clearance 
position to provide access for removal of the closure 

member, and the said closure member has a configuration 
providing at least one cam surface (7) for selective 

engagement with the valve seating means to overcome said 
bias and urge said valve seating means into the clearance 

position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ball valves and in particular 
to a device for facilitating the removal the ball of a ball 
valve from the valve seat for examination or repair. Ball valves generally comprise a housing having a 
substantially spherical socket defined therein by valve 
seats. A ball is located within the socket and moveable 
between a first position in which the valve is open and a 
second position in which the valve is closed. In normal 
operation, the valve seats are biased into a position in 
which they contact the ball. In order to remove the ball from the valve for example 
for examination or repair, the ball has to be lifted clear 
of the valve seats. This has in the past been done by a 
number of unsatisfactory methods such as by retracting the 
valve seats using hydraulic pistons, by providing threaded 
seats which are removed from the valve to release the ball, 
or by providing spacers between the ball and the valve seats 
which, when removed, allow the ball to be removed from the 
socket. These known methods increase the number of components 
which make up the ball valve and therefore increase the cost 
of the valve. Furthermore, by increasing the number of 
components in the valve, the number of potential leak paths 
are increased which reduces the reliability of the valve. The present invention aims to overcome or at least 
mitigate the above disadvantages associated with the known 
ball valves. According to one aspect of the present invention there 
is provided a ball valve comprising a housing having a fluid 
passage, a valve closure member having curved surfaces, 
valve seating means providing corresponding valve seat 
surfaces for receiving said closure member, and means for 
selectively engaging said closure member in said valve seat 
surfaces to provide for closure of said passage, wherein the 
valve seating means are adapted to be retracted from an 
operative position wherein said seat surfaces are biased  
 
into contact with the closure member to a clearance position 
to provide access for removal of the closure member, and the 
said closure member has a configuration providing at least 
one cam surface for selective engagement with the valve 
seating means to overcome said bias and urge said valve 
seating means into the clearance position. Preferably, there may be provided locking means for 
holding the valve seating means in the clearance position 
against the bias. The locking means may be in the form of 
one or more pins placed adjacent to or through the valve 
seating

A ball valve comprising a housing having a fluid 
passage, a valve closure member having curved surfaces, 

valve seating means providing corresponding valve seat 
surfaces for receiving said closure member, and means for 

selectively engaging said closure member in said valve seat 
surfaces to provide for closure of said passage, wherein the 

valve seating means are adapted to be retracted from an 
operative position wherein said seat surfaces are biased 

into contact with the closure member to a clearance position 
to provide access for removal of the closure member, and the 

said closure member has a configuration providing at least 
one cam surface for selective engagement with the valve 

seating means to overcome said bias and urge said valve 
seating means into the clearance position. 
A ball valve according to claim 1, wherein a locking 
means is provided for holding the valve seating means in the 

clearance position against the bias. 
A ball valve according to claim 2, wherein the locking 
means is in the form of one or more pins placed adjacent to 

or through the valve seating means in order to prevent the 
valve seating means from returning to the operative 

position. 
A ball valve according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein a cam surface is provided on the upper and 

lower surfaces of the closure member. 
A ball valve according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein each cam surface is provided with two 

opposed cam lobes.
