 ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION SUSCEPTOR MATERIAL EMPLOYING FERROMAGNETIC AMORPHOUS ALLOY PARTICLESTechnical Field This invention relates to electromagnetic radiation susceptor materials which comprise particles dispersed in dielectric binders.BackgroundElectromagnetic radiation susceptor materials typically comprise one or more kinds of particles dispersed through a dielectric binder material. Incident radiation (typically in the GHz region of the spectrum) is converted into heat that is re-radiated by the susceptor to the surrounding environment. In this respect, susceptor materials differ from shielding materials, which reflect incident radiation with essentially no heating, and from absorbing materials, which attempt to completely frustrate the incident radiation by destructive interference.Summary of Invention The invention is an electromagnetic radiation susceptor material, comprising at least one type of ferromagnetic amorphous alloy particle and a dielectric binder through which the particle(s) is (are) dispersed. Any of the dispersed particles comprises a ferromagnetic amorphous alloy having the composition F100.y.xMyTMx, where F is one or more magnetic element(s) selected from the group consisting of Fe, Co, and Ni; M is one or more metaloid(s) selected from the group consisting of B, C, Al, Si, P, Ge and As; TM is one or more transition metal(s) selected from columns IIIB (including the rare earths) to VIIB of the periodic table, especially Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Zr, Nb, and Ta; 0.<x <.20; and 10 y O.The transition metal component controls the Curie temperature of the alloy, and thus the magnetic response of the particles, providing self-regulation of temperature surrounding the susceptor material.Detailed Description The susceptor material of the invention comprises at least one species of ferromagnetic amorphous particle dispersed in a dielectric binder material. Typical volume loading factors range from one to 50 percent.Any of the dispersed species of particles comprises ferromagnetic alloys having the composition F100.y.xMyTMx, where F is one or more magnetic 

 elements selected from the group consisting of Fe, Co, and Ni; M is one or more metaloϊds selected from the group consisting of B, C, Al, Si, P, Ge and As; TM is one or more transition metal(s) selected from columns IIIB (including the rare earths) to VIIB of the periodic table, especially Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Zr, Nb, and Ta; 0-<x.<20; andThe transition metal component controls the Curie temperature of the alloy, typically permitting a choice of
