<ABSTRACT>
The structure comprises a number of equal 
modules (M0,M1) being aligned vertically and composed 

of functional elements (FF1-3,+/-) laid side-by-side, 
and supply, control, and interconnection paths 

(gnd,vdd,bus1-8,vrt1-2) which extend at different 
levels over the substrate. Supply connection paths 

(gnd,vdd) extend horizontally across each module, 
control paths (vrt1-2) extend vertically across 

functional elements of adjacent modules, and 
interconnection paths between elements in one module 

are formed by horizontal sections (bus1a, bus2a and 
bus3a) and vertical sections (a1,a2 and a3). 
This structure is specially advantageous in 
terms of occupied area, and can be used in a CAD 
designing system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to semiconductor
monolithic integrated circuits, and in particular to an
integrated circuit structure for processing digital
data which comprises a plurality of circuit modules,
each composed of various circuit elements.As is known, a monolithic integrated circuit
is a substantially planar structure consisting of
active and passive electronic components which are
formed on a substrate of a semiconductor material by
local modification, using known masking and doping
techniques, of the conduction properties of the
semiconductor and forming on the substrate electrically
conductive paths for interconnecting components or
functional groups and selectively controlling the
conductivity of the active components during the
circuit operation. The circuit architecture or design,
i.e. the layout of the components and functional groups
on the substrate and the pattern of interconnecting and
control paths, is settled to provide a circuit having
the functional features sought.The design of very large scale integrated
(VLSI) circuits, particularly of logic networks for
processing digital data, is known to include standard
cells, or elementary cells, each capable of performing 
a predetermined function. Such standard cells may
either comprise comparatively simple circuits, such as
logic gates and bistable circuits, or more complex
circuits, such as add/subtractors, comparators,
converters, etc.. To provide a predetermined logic
network, a number of standard cells must be selected
and suitably connected together, and a set of masks
prepared to define the architecture of a circuit to be
implemented on the semiconductor substrate.Two factors that should never be overlooked
in the manufacture of VLSI circuits are the size of the
substrate area occupied and the length of the electric
interconnections; both the area occupied and the length
of the interconnections should be the smallest
possible, because an optimum utilization of the
available area would afford savings in production costs
and shorter interconnections would bring about
functional advantages, especially in terms of
processing rate. Normally, successful attempts to fill
the former demand also contribute toward satisfying the
latter.US-A-4 988 636 discloses a method of arranging elementary cells
of input/output circuitry on a substrate.US-A-4 947 229 discloses power source wiring consisting
of sections extending in orthogonal directions and formed from
two levels of metallisation.In the instance of complex logic networks,
