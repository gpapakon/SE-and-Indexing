<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of 
certain azoxycyanide compounds, especially arylazoxycyanide 
compounds which exhibit biocidal activity. A number of routes for the preparation of arylazoxycyanide 
compounds have already been disclosed. For instance, Eur. J. Med. 
Chem. - Chim. Ther., 1982, 17, pp. 482-484 discloses the oxidation 
of an arylazocyanide under harsh conditions using 90% hydrogen 
peroxide in trifluoroacetic acid. However, such a route would be 
hazardous and expensive for the large scale preparation of 
arylazoxycyanide compounds. European patent application no. 92120580.3 discloses a 
modification of the above oxidation process in which an 
arylazocyanide is oxidised under milder conditions with a mixture 
comprising hydrogen peroxide and methanoic acid and/or with 
peroxymethanoic acid. However, as this modified process still uses 
potentially hazardous materials, it is not suitable for use on a 
commercial scale. Another route, described in J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun., 
1984, pp 323-324, involves the reduction of an aromatic nitro group 
to a hydroxylamine followed by oxidation back to a nitroso compound 
and, in turn, coupling with cyanamide using iodobenzene diacetate 
in stoichiometric amounts. A severe disadvantage of this route for 
large scale preparation of arylazoxycyanide compounds is the 
requirement for stoichiometric amounts of iodobenzene diacetate. 
Iodobenzene diacetate is not available in large quantities and this 
adds significantly to the costs of the preparation. A modification of the above process is described in European 
patent application no. 92120580.3 which uses dibromoisocyanuric 
acid in place of iodobenzene diacetate. However, although 
dibromoisocyanuric acid is cheaper to produce than iodobenzene  
 
diacetate, it is not commercially available. Moreover, in large 
scale preparation, dibromoisocyanuric acid causes the release of 
elemental bromine which partially oxidises the nitroso precursor to 
nitroaromatic compounds and the final product is therefore always 
contaminated with differing amounts of nitro compounds. It has now been discovered that arylazoxycyanide compounds can 
be produced in high yield from the corresponding nitroso compound 
using reagents that are commercially available at reasonable 
prices. Moreover, since these reagents do not appear to cause the 
release of elemental bromine, the formation of undesired 
by-products is greatly reduced. According to the present invention there is therefore provided 
a
