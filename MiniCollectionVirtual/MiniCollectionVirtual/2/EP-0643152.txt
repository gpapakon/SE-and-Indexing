<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cutting tool material comprising a cermet base material and a multilayer hard material layer having at least one oxide layer. The layer directly adjoining the base material is a titanium nitride layer and/or a titanium carbonitride layer having a nitrogen content of at least 5 atom %. The oxide layer is deposited at a coating temperature of at least 900 DEG C. As a result of the layer structure of the invention, even cermet cutting tool materials having high binder metal contents have excellent wear performance and can be inexpensively produced.
