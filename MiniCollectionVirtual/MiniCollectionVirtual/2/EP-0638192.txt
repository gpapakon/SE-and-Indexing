<ABSTRACT>
A tracking system suitable for tracking merchandise in a warehouse, is described. The system includes a number of trolleys (3), each including a caster (5) which contains a radio transceiver (7). A metallic track (9) is provided around the perimeter of each caster (5) containing a transceiver (7) so as to form an antenna for the transceiver. A series of electrically conductive strips (13) are arranged on the floor carrying the trolleys (3), so as to form an antenna for a transmitter and receiver included in a central control system (1). The central control system (1) is effective to transmit signals to and receive signals from the transceivers (7) carried in the casters (5), so as to determine which trolleys (3) are present in the warehouse.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TRACKING SYSTEMBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to tracking systems. The invention has particular, although not exclusive, relevance to tracking systems for tracking merchandise in, for example, warehouses so as to prevent theft of the merchandise.It is well known that there is a problem of theft in the transportation of merchandise between locations, for example, factories and warehouses. Generally, the merchandise is loaded on to trolleys which are then loaded on to the lorries which transport the merchandise. It is found that a large number of trolleys, together with the merchandise carried on them, tend to disappear every year.It is an object of the present invention to provide a tracking system which is suitable for monitoring the movement of such trolleys.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAccording to a first aspect of the present invention 

there is provided a tracking system including a central control system incorporating a transmitter means and a receiver means; a plurality of transport devices each carried on a number of wheel members wherein at least one of the wheel members for each transport device carries at least one transceiver, and an electrically conductive pattern arranged on the support surface for the transport devices effective to constitute an aerial for the transmitter means and receiver means incorporated in the central control system; the central control system being effective to send signals to the transceivers and receive and process signals from the transceivers, thereby monitoring the presence of the transport devices.It will be seen that by positioning the transceivers in the wheel members, it is possible to distance the transceivers from other metallic portions of the transport device which otherwise may cause electrical interference. Furthermore, by positioning the antennae for the transceivers in the wheel members, and the antenna for the central control system on the support surface for the transport devices, the distance between the antennae for the transceivers, and the antenna for the central control system is minimised, thus minimising the transmission power requirements of the system. 

An electrically conductive track may be arranged around said one wheel member so as to constitute an antenna for the transceiver. Such an arrangement will allow the distance between the antennae for the transceivers, and the antenna for the central control system to be reduced even further.Each transport device is suitably a trolley.Each wheel member is suitably a

CLAIMS
1. A tracking system including a central control system incorporating a transmitter means and a receiver means; a plurality of transport devices each carried on a number of wheel members wherein at least one of the wheel members for each transport device carries at least one transceiver, and an electrically conductive pattern arranged on the support surface for the transport devices effective to constitute an aerial for the transmitter means and receiver means incorporated in the central control system; the central control system being effective to send signals to the transceivers and receive and process signals from the transceivers, thereby monitoring the presence of the transport devices.
2. A tracking system according to claim 1 in which an electrically conductive track is arranged around said one wheel member so as to constitute an antenna for the transceiver.
3. A tracking system according to either of the preceding claims in which each transport device is a trolley.
4. A tracking system according to any one of the preceding claims in which each wheel member is a caster. 


5. A tracking system according to any one of the preceding claims in which the transceiver is mounted on the wheel member such that it does not rotate with rotation of the wheel member.
6. A tracking system according to any one of the preceding claims in which said one wheel member carries more than one transceiver.
7. A tracking system according to any one of the preceding claims in which each transceiver is carried on a threadguard mounted on the wheel member.
8. A tracking system according to any one of the preceding claims in which the electrically conductive pattern takes the form of an electrically conductive loop around the edge of the floor of an enclosed area.
9. A tracking system according to claim 8 in which the enclosed area is a vehicle in which the transport devices are located.
10. A track system according to any one of claims 1 to 3 in which the electrically conductive pattern comprises a continuous electrically conductive area. 


11. A tracking system according to any one of the preceding claims in which the electrically conductive pattern is formed on a mat on which the transport devices sit.
12. A tracking system according to any one of the preceding claims in which the conductive pattern is formed into a number of zones, such that the central control system is able to differentiate between the zones.
13. A tracking system according to any one of the preceding claims in which the central control system includes means for transmitting a series of interrogating signals to each transceiver, the first interrogating signal in each series being effective to elicite a response signal from the transceiver which is used by the central control system to determine whether the transreceiver is within a first range of transceivers, and the subsequent signals within the series being effective to elicit a further response signal from the transceiver to determine whether the transceiver lies within a second, narrower, range of transceivers within the first range.
14. A wheel member for use on a transport device, the wheel member carrying a transceiver; and an 


electrically conductive track formed around the support surface contacting perimeter of the wheel member so as to form at least part of an antenna for the transceiver.
15. A wheel member according to claim 14 in the form of a caster.
