<ABSTRACT>
An illumination unit according to the invention comprises an electrodeless 
low-pressure discharge lamp 10. The illumination unit is provided with a lamp vessel 20 

which encloses a discharge space 21 which contains an ionizable filling. The 
illumination unit is in addition provided with a holder 60 for the lamp vessel 20, with a 

coil 30 for generating a high-frequency magnetic field so as to maintain an electric 
discharge in the discharge space 21, and with a high-frequency supply 50 for the coil. 

The illumination unit is further provided with ignition aids 40 for promoting the 
initiation of the discharge. The coil 30 has a primary 31 and a secondary winding 32, 

the primary winding 31 having a first 34A and a second end 34B which are connected 
to a first 51 and a second contact 52, respectively, of the supply 50, such that the first 

contact 51 supplies a high-frequency voltage and the second contact 52 a reference 
voltage free from high-frequency variations in a nominal operational state of the 

illumination unit, in which state a voltage gradient arises in the primary winding 31 in a 
direction from the first 34A to the second end 34B, whereby a voltage gradient is 

generated in the secondary winding 32 in a direction from a first 35A to a second end 
35B which is opposed to that from the first 34A to the second end 34B in the primary 

winding 31, while high-frequency variations of the voltage averaged over the joint 
surface area of the primary 31 and the secondary winding 32 are comparatively s
mall 
against high-frequency variations of the voltage averaged over the surface of the 

primary winding 31. The ignition aids 40 achieve that, after switching-on of the 
illumination unit, the nominal operational state is preceded by an ignition state in which 

the second end 35B of the secondary winding 32 is disconnected from the second 
contact 52 of the supply 50. The measure counteracts attacks on the wall of the 

discharge vessel 20.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an illumination unit comprising an electrodeless 
low-pressure discharge lamp, 
which illumination unit is provided with a lamp vessel enclosing a discharge space which contains an ionizable 
filling, a holder for the lamp vessel, a coil for generating a high-frequency magnetic field for maintaining an 
electric discharge in the discharge space, a high-frequency supply for the coil, and ignition aids for promoting an initiation of the discharge, which coil is provided with a primary and a secondary winding, the 
primary winding having a first and a second end which, in a nominal operational state of the illumination unit, are connected to a first and a 
second contact, respectively, of the supply, the secondary winding having a second end (35B, 135B, 235Q) which, in a nominal operational state of the illumination unit, is connected to said second contact, while in a nominal operational state of the 
illumination unit the first contact supplies a high-frequency voltage and the second 
contact supplies a reference voltage free from high-frequency variations, in which state 
a voltage gradient arises in the primary winding in a direction from the first to the 
second end, and in the secondary winding a voltage gradient is generated in a direction 
from a first to a second end which is opposed to that from the first to the second end in 
the primary winding, while high-frequency variations of the voltage averaged over the 
joint surface area of the primary and the secondary winding are comparatively small in 
relation to high-frequency variations of the voltage averaged over the surface area of the 
primary winding. The invention also relates to an electrodeless low-pressure discharge lamp 
suitable for use in the illumination unit, and also to a holder and to a supply unit 
suitable for use in such an illumination unit. Such an illumination unit is known from EP 0.332.263 A1. In the known 
illumination unit, the supply is accommodated in a housing fastened to the lamp vessel.  
 
A first contact of the supply delivers a voltage which varies with high frequency, i.e. 
with a frequency above 20 kHz. In fact, the frequency is approximately 3 MHz. The 
supply has a second contact which supplies a reference voltage free from high-frequency 
variations. The reference voltage is, for example, equal to earth potential, but may 
alternatively be any other voltage free from high-frequency variations. This 
asymmetrical supply may be comparatively simple in comparison with a symmetrical 
suppl
