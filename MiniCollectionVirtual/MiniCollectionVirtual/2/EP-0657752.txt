reflecting infrared radiation and transmitting visible radiation 

comprises three spectrally adjacent multiperiod stacks, two of 
said stacks being shortwave pass stacks, the third stack containing 

seven alternating layers of high and low refractive index materials and 
having a period of the form



(L/a H/b L/c H/d L/c H/b L/a) 



 
wherein a, b, c and d are predetermined values, and wherein L and 

A are a low and a high index of refraction material, respectively, L and

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to thin film 
optical coatings and pertains, more particularly, to 
optical coatings deposited on a surface of an electric 
lamp envelope. Thin film optical coatings of the interference 
filter variety consist of alternating layers of a low 
refractive index material such as silica and a high 
refractive index material such as tantala, titania, 
niobia and the like for selectively reflecting and 
transmitting different portions of the electromagnetic 
spectrum emitted by the filament. In one application, 
these coatings form an optical interference filter for 
selectively reflecting infrared energy emitted by the 
lamp filament back to the filament while transmitting 
the visible light portion of the electromagnetic 
spectrum emitted by the filament. As a result, the 
amount of electrical energy required to maintain the 
operating temperature of the filament is reduced. Such filters and lamps employing same are 
disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,229,066, 
which issued to Rancourt et al on October 21, 1980.  
 
Rancourt et al disclose a visible transmitting and 
infrared reflecting filter comprising at least one 
period of a stack formed of a plurality of layers of 
high and low index materials with alternate layers 
being formed of materials having a high index of 
refraction and the other layers being formed of 
materials having a low index of refraction. One or 
more anti-reflection layers are disposed between 
adjacent layers of the period. The forty-seven layer 
filter presented as an example in column 5 of Rancourt 
et al includes thirty-seven thin layers (i.e., less 
than 400 Angstrom). U.S. Patent No. 5,138,219, which issued to Krisl 
et al on August 11, 1992, discloses a filter 
comprising three spectrally adjacent multiperiod 
stacks with the first stack being a conventional 
shortwave pass stack having at least two periods. The 
second and third stacks are spectrally located at 
wavelengths different from each other and longer than 
the wavelength of the first stack. The latter two 
stacks each comprise at least two periods, with each 
period containing seven alternating layers of high and 
low refractive index materials. In the example 
presented in TABLE 2, Krisl et al disclose a filter 
containing 24 thin layers to provide a spectrally 
broad high transmittance between 400 and 770 
nanometers. Although the above-described filters of Rancourt 
et al and Krisl et al may be effective for reflecting 
infrared radiation while transmitting visible
