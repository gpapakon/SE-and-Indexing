<ABSTRACT>
A self-holding type solenoid valve has an exciting 
coil 13 and an exciting circuit 3 that switches the direction 

of flow of exciting current passing through the coil. 
When a positive exciting current flows through the coil 13, 

a movable iron core 18 is attracted to a stationary iron 
core 15 and held in the attracted position by a self-contained 

permanent magnet 14. When a reversed current 
flows through the coil 13, a return spring 19 releases the 

movable iron core 18 away from the stationary iron core 15.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a self-holding type solenoid 
valve which maintain its operating condition by means of 
a permanent magnet. One example of such a self-holding type solenoid valve 
employing a permanent magnet is disclosed in Japanese 
Provisional Patent Publication JP-A-63297883, which forms a basis for the preamble of claim 1. This 
self-holding type solenoid valve comprises a main valve 
segment including a valve member that switches the direction 
of flow of fluid between multiple ports and a solenoid 
segment that actuates the valve member. The solenoid 
segment comprises a bobbin surrounded by two coils of wire, 
a magnetic frame and a magnetic plate surrounding the 
bobbin, a stationary iron core and a self-holding permanent 
magnet fitted to the centre hole in the bobbin, and a 
movable iron core slidably fitted in the same centre hole 
in the bobbin. When one of the two coils of wire is energized, 
the movable iron core is attracted to the stationary 
iron core, whereupon the valve member moves to switch the 
flow of liquid between the ports and the self-contained 
permanent magnet holds the movable iron core in the attracted  
 
position. When the other coil is energised, the movable 
iron core is released from the stationary iron core and the valve 
member returns to its original position. The conventional self-holding type solenoid valve just 
described requires two coils of wire, one attracting the movable 
iron core to the stationery iron core and the other releasing the 
movable iron core from the attracted position in which it is held 
by means of the self-contained permanent magnet. Because two 
coils occupy a large space, the solenoid segment and the solenoid 
valve become larger than is desired. EP-A-219572 shows an electrically operated vacuum valve 
with a single coil. An actuating member is attracted to a 
permanent magnet when the coil is energised in one direction and 
then held by the permanent magnet and is released and moves away 
from the permanent magnet when the coil is energised in the 
reverse direction. A primary object of this invention is to provide a small 
and simple self-holding type solenoid valve that provides a 
function to attract a movable iron core to a stationery iron core 
and a function to release the movable iron core from the 
attracted position with only one coil. According to the invention there is provided a self-holding 
type solenoid valve comprising a main valve segment having 
multiple ports and a valve member to switch the communication

<CLAIMS>
A self-holding type solenoid valve comprising a main 
valve segment (1) having multiple ports (P, A, R) and a valve 

member (7) to switch the communication therebetween, a solenoid 
segment (2) comprising a coil (13) wound around a bobbin (12), 

a stationary iron core (15) and a permanent magnet (14) fastened 
in a centre hole (12a) in the bobbin (12), a moveable iron core 

(18) for actuating the valve member (7) and inserted in the 
centre hole (12a) in such a manner as to be slidable toward and 

away from the stationery iron core (15), and a return spring (19) 
urging the movable iron core (18) away from the stationary iron 

core (15), the movable iron core (18) being attracted to the 
stationary iron core (15) when a forward energising current flows 

through the coil, and being held thereagainst by the permanent 
magnet (14), characterised by: an energising 

circuit (3) for supplying an energising current in the forward 
or reverse direction of flow through the coil (13), the movable iron core (18) being 

released away from the stationary iron core (15) when a reversed 
energising current flows through the coil (13), a step (15a) 

on the stationary iron core (15) engaging with a step (12b) in the 
centre hole (12a) in the bobbin (12), the permanent magnet (14) 

being mounted at the back of the stationary iron core (15), and the 
stationary iron core (15) and permanent magnet (14) being fastened 

in the centre hole (12a) by means of a set nut (16) of 
ferromagnetic material that presses the permanent magnet (16) 

against the stationary iron core (15), the set nut (16) being 
screwed into a magnet frame (10) surrounding the bobbin (12) and 

forming a part of a magnetic path. 
A self-holding type solenoid valve as claimed in Claim 
1 in which a bolt (22) screwed into the set nut (16) fastens a 

plate (23) to the outside of the solenoid segment (2) and a case 
(24) formed on the plate contains a printed circuit board (26) 

carrying the energising circuit (3).
