<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to packaging 
structures for shock sensitive articles such as computer 
monitors, microwave ovens, television sets or the like. Currently, the shipment of fragile articles, 
regardless of size and weight, requires special packaging 
to avoid damage to the articles. For this purpose, 
materials such as crumpled paper, nuggets of expanded 
foam and/or preformed expanded polystyrene foam is used 
to package fragile articles, including but not limited to 
electronic articles such as computer monitors, radios, 
television sets, computer CPUs, microwave ovens, disk 
drives, VCR's and the like. The preformed polystyrene 
foam material is often provided in the form of "corners" 
or other support pieces which envelop at least portions 
of the packaged fragile article. Aside from being bulky, upon an initial impact, 
polystyrene foam loses virtually all of its shock 
absorbing qualities. Thus, fragile articles packaged 
with rigid pieces of expanded polystyrene foam as the 
protective media are susceptible to damage from repeated 
shocks to the box or container. A related disadvantage 
of such foam packaging is that a relatively thick piece 
of foam must be employed to protect a packaged article 
from impact, even though only a portion of the foam will 
be compressed upon impact. Another disadvantage of conventional polystyrene 
foam is that its bulkiness requires packagers to allot 
significant warehouse storage space to the foam packaging 
elements prior to use. Also, shippers are required to 
select shipping containers, such as corrugated boxes, 
which are substantially larger than the article being 
packaged, merely to accommodate sufficient thicknesses of 
polystyrene foam which can absorb only one impact. 
Larger containers require additional warehouse space, 
both before and after assembly, and also take up more 
space per article shipped in rail cars or trailers.  
 Yet another disadvantage of conventional packaging 
for fragile articles is that because of its bulkiness, it 
is not generally economically feasible to ship the 
expanded polystyrene foam to a recycling location. 
Furthermore, even when the expanded polystyrene foam is 
recycled into product, the cost of recycling is 
relatively large and, generally, no more than about 25% 
recycled content can be utilized, with a remainder being 
virgin material. Indeed, considering the great quantity 
of expanded polystyrene foam which is currently in use to 
provide fragility packaging and the general lack of 
adequate

<CLAIMS>
A unitary packaging structure (10) for a shock 
sensitive article (12), comprising: 


a platform portion (18) adapted to support at least 
a portion of the article (12) and having a peripheral 

portion (20); and 
a sidewall structure (22) of flexible material 
forming an enclosure (24) around at least a portion of 

said platform portion (18), said sidewall structure (22) 
including an inboard wall (32) joined to said peripheral 

portion (20), and an outboard wall (38) maintained in 
spaced relationship from said inboard wall (32) by a 

bridge section (26), said inboard wall (32) being 
relatively shorter than said outboard wall (38) so that 

said platform (18) is held a specified cushion distance 
(58) above a lower edge of said outboard wall (38), 

characterised in that the structure (10) further 
comprises: 


shock limiting means (54) formed in said sidewall 
structure (22) for restricting the movement of said 

platform portion (18) toward said lower edge of said 
outboard wall (38) upon shock loading of said platform 

portion (18), said shock limiting means including at 
least one indentation (54) in said bridge section 

(26) and said inboard and outboard walls (32, 38), the or 
each indentation (54) defining said sidewall structure 

(22) into multiple wall segments having end faces (56a, 
56b), and upon shock loading of said platform portion 

(18), said end faces of adjacent wall segments being 
configured to contact each other to limit the movement of 

said platform portion (18). 
A packaging structure (10) according to claim 1, 
wherein the or each indentation (54) is generally V-shaped 

and extends from said bridge section (26) into 
said inboard wall (32) and said outboard wall (38).  

 
A packaging structure (10) according to claim 2, 
wherein said shock limiting means (54) limits the 

movement of said platform portion (18) to a distance 
which is less than or equal to said cushion distance. 
A packaging structure (10) according to any 
preceding claim, wherein said inboard wall (32) and said 

outboard wall (38) are drafted relative to said bridge 
section (26) for facilitating nesting of multiple package 

structures. 
A packaging structure (310) according to any 
preceding claim, wherein said bridge section (26a) is 

rounded in cross-section. 
A packaging structure (310a) according to any of 
claims 1 to 4, wherein said bridge section (26b) is 

pointed in cross-section. 
A packaging structure (310) according to any 
preceding claim, including a web of material (74) secured 

to a lower edge of said sidewall structure (22) to define 
an air pocket. 
A packaging structure (10) for a shock sensitive 
article (12), comprising a first unitary packaging 

structure unit (10b) according to claim 1 disposed in a 
tight, nesting relationship to another such unitary 

packaging structure (10c).
