<ABSTRACT>
What is specified is a method for packaging a roll formed by a wound-up material web, in which an end cover is used for covering each of the end faces, and a roll-packaging device with a roll repository (1) and with an end-cover applicator (2) having an aligning station (3) and applicator means (11) for each end cover. It is thereby to become possible to use conventional end covers for packaging in such a way that no plugs are required in the core of the wound-up roll. For this purpose, the end cover (4, 4a) is connected to the circumference of the roll (5, 5a). Provided for this purpose are an adhesive-tape dispenser (21) and pressure means (24, 31) which bring an adhesive tape (22) out of the adhesive-tape dispenser (21) to bear on the end cover (4, 4a) and on the circumference of the roll (5, 5a).

Method of packaging a roll formed by a wound web of 
material, in which an end disc is used to cover each of the 

end faces, characterised in that the end disc is connected 
to part of the circumference of the roll in that at least 

one fixing means is glued on to one region of the outer 
surface of the end disc and one region of the circumference 

of the roll and the roll is then eneveloped in a packaging 
material, the axial excess of which is folded on to the end 

disc. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the end 
disc is aligned with at least one circumferential portion 

on the circumference of the roll and is fixed to this 
circumferential portion. 
Method according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in 
that the end discs are fixed to the top of the roll in the 

direction of gravity. 
Method according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
fixing means is fixed to the bottom of the end disc in the 

direction of gravity and the end disc is rotated through 
approximately 180° before it is applied to the roll. 
Method according to claim 4, characterised in that the end 
disc is rotated through 180° during transportation from an 

aligning station to the roll. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in 

that an adhesive tape bearing both against the end disc and 
against the roll over a length in the region of 30 to 

150 mm is used as the fixing means.  
 
Method according to claim 6, characterised in that the 
adhesive tape is brushed over from a central region towards 

its end with each bonding process and this movement 
continues beyond the end of the adhesive tape. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in 
that the end face of the end disc is secured against 

folding down when the roll is enveloped in a packaging web, 
during which process the roll is rotated. 
Method according to claim 8, characterised in that air 
lets, in particular consisting of warm air, directed on to 

the end disc are used for securing. 
Device for fixing end discs to a roll, comprising a roll 
rack, an end disc applicator having means for applying each 

end disc, an adhesive tape dispenser and pressure means 
which take an adhesive tape from the adhesive tape 

dispenser and bring it to bear against the end disc and 
against the circumference of the roll, in particular for 

carrying out the method according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the pressure means (24, 31) can move 

relative to the roll substantially in the radial and axial 
direction over the adhesive tape (21). 
Device according to claim 10, characterised in that the 
pressure means (24, 31) have a first pressure roller (24) 

with a first drive (29) which brings the first pressure 
roller (24) to bear against the end disc (4, 4a) and then 

moves it away from the adhesive tape dispenser (21). 
Device according to claim 10 or claim 11, characterised in  
 

that the pressure means have a second pressure roller (31) 
arranged in particular in the region of the roll rack (1), 

with a second drive (36) which moves the second pressure 
roller (31) radially outwards over the outer surface of the 

end disc (4, 4a) and along the circumference of the roll 
(5, 5a) axially to the axial centre of the roll. 
Device according to claim 12, characterised in that the 
second pressure roller (31) is mounted on lever rods (32) 

which are radially displaceable in a guide (35) and on 
which the second drive (36) exerts a force having both a 

radial and an axial component. 
Device according to claim 13, characterised in that the 
lever rods (32) are blocked in the guide (35) as soon as 

the second pressure roller (31) moves axially. 
Device according to one of claims 10 to 14, characterised 
by a transfer means (2) which grips the end disc (4, 4a) in 

the aligning station and, rotating the end disc through 
approximately 180°, brings it to bear against the end face 

of the roll (5, 5a).
