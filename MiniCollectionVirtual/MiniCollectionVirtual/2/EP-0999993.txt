<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in and relating to air jet piddling, and more particularly to an improved piddler that uses an air jet and to an improved process relating thereto and to improved products obtained thereby.An integral step in many processes or systems for the production of textile fibers has been the collection of a rapidly moving multifilamentary strand in a container for transport to the next processing step. This process, often called piddling or canning, has provided a means by which one or more filamentary strands (referred to herein as tow or rope) were collected and possibly combined before processing through a draw/crimp step, which is often performed at a speed that has generally been much slower than the previous step, such as, for example, spinning a synthetic polymer to form synthetic filaments. A long-standing problem in the piddling process has been how to deposit such a rapidly-moving line into the can in such a way as to avoid entanglements that may be a problem particularly upon subsequent removal of product from the can. Several methods are available commercially and/or have been published.The system of piddling a textile rope that is currently preferred commercially involves using a pair of toothed rolls to pull a tow from the primary (withdrawal) spinning rolls. Such toothed rolls, often referred to as gear rolls, gear plaiters or sunflower rolls, are available on piddler systems marketed by IWKA, Neumag, and Fleissner, for example. In these units, the toothed rolls are intended to pull the tow strand from a previous roll and to release the strand in such a way that it (1) does not wrap any rolls, and (2) is distributed so as to land softly in the can. To accomplish the first objective (a low wrap potential), large diameter rolls are used with many teeth to provide a small fiber contact area at the tip of each tooth. To enhance release of the filaments, the teeth are often coated with a low friction material and the surface speed of the toothed rolls is often greater than the speed of the moving tow band to enable the teeth to slip over the fibers and to avoid developing too much static friction. A soft landing of the moving tow line into the can is caused primarily by converting a large portion of the velocity of the moving tow band into a horizontal component. This is accomplished primarily by intermeshing the teeth from the two adjacent rolls so that the tow band folds upon itself. The vertical component of the velocity is further reduced by the tendency of
