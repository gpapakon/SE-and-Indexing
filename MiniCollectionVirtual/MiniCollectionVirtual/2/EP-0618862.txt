<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a multilayer packaging film
having good barrier resistance to the transmission of
oxygen and water vapour, good printability; and the ability
to receive a firmly bonded metal layer thereon. Certain
polymeric films e.g., polypropylene, employed for the
packaging of foods, inherently permit the transmission of
oxygen and water vapour from outside of the film to inside
of a package made up of the film. Oxygen and water vapour
permits rapid deterioration of foods packaged in containers
made from such a film. Metal deposits on such films are
desirable because of the improvement in appearance and in
providing yet another layer which militates against the
invasion of oxygen and water vapour.Thus, it is a principal object of the present
invention to present a film which has excellent
printability, can have a metal layer firmly bonded thereto
and which has significantly decreased oxygen and water
vapour transmission rates.According to one aspect of this invention, there is
provided a multilayer film comprising:
(a) an oriented polymeric substrate which inherently
permits the transmission of oxygen and water vapour;(b) a primer coating on at least one surface of said
substrate;(c) a layer of cross-linked polyvinyl alcohol on the
primer coating; and(d) a layer of an intimate blend of a homo- or
copolymer of vinyl alcohol, with an ethylene acrylic acid
co-polymer.It is preferred that the substrate layer be corona
discharge treated prior to receipt of the primer coating. The substrates contemplated herein include any
polymeric film substrate which inherently permits the
transmission of oxygen and water vapour and wherein the
utility of such film for packaging purposes may call for a
minimisation of such transmission. In most cases the source
of oxygen and water vapour is atmospheric oxygen and water
vapour. While nylon, polyethylene teraphthalate and
polycarbonate films are contemplated herein, the
particularly preferred class of films are the polyolefins.
Within the polyolefins class, homopolymer and copolymers of
propylene are preferred. Particularly preferred are
isotactic polypropylenes containing at least 80% by weight of
isotactic polypropylene. The preferred base substrate layer
can be homopolypropylene having a melting point from 152 to
171째C (305 to 340째F), preferably from 161 to 169째C (321 to
336째F); an inherent viscosity from 1.4 to 4.0; an MFI (melt
flow index) from 0.5 to 12; an MW (molecular weight) from
100,000 to 600,000; and a density from 0.89 to 0.91.
