<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a device and method for breaking an 
ampoule. In particular, the device is preferably for use in an 

apparatus for 
collecting and transporting biological specimens. The device comprises a 

guard arrangement (10) that surrounds a frangible ampoule (40). With 
appropriate 

force applied to the guard arrangement, the frangible ampoule is 
ruptured.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device and method for breaking 
ampoules. In particular the device may be used for breaking ampoules in 
an apparatus for collecting and transporting biological specimens. An element common to most devices for collecting and 
transporting biological specimens is an ampoule in a container that can be 
broken to release medium into the container to keep the swab and sample 
moist. A typical collecting and transporting device has been described in 
several publications and most specifically in U.S. Patent No. 4,014,748. A commercially available device for collecting and transporting 
biological specimens is the CULTURETTE® Collection and Transport 
System (trademark of Becton, Dickinson and Company) sold by Becton 
Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Maryland. The 
CULTURETTE device is for collecting and transporting a biological  
 
sample with a protective sleeve or skirt surrounding the container where 
the ampoule, which is to be broken for use, is contained. A problem that has confronted users of collection and transport 
devices is maintaining the viability and preventing the contamination of 
any biological sample which is collected. In spite of the use of a high level 
of skill and care in collecting the specimen so as to prevent contamination 
of the specimen, viability of the microorganisms is not always assured by 
the use of the prior art collection devices. It is the object of the present invention to provide 
an improved device for effectively and 
efficiently handling ampoules. Such a device would be comparatively 
simple and inexpensive to manufacture as compared to available devices. The device of the invention is defined by claim 1. In particular, the device may be used in an apparatus for 
collecting and transporting biological specimens to substantially prevent 
the specimen collected in the apparatus from being exposed to the outside 
environment. The device is a guard arrangement having two rigid, 
movable and opposing members spaced sufficiently from one another 
surrounding an ampoule. The movable members extend from a forward 
end to a rearward end. The movable members are folded 
together at the rearward end. Preferably the movable members are 
connected by a living hinge at the rearward end. Each member comprises a wall with an outer surface, an 
inner surface and an edge. The inner surfaces face each other to form a 
cavity that surrounds an ampoule and the edges face each other to form a 
gap. The ampoule may be placed or attached in the

<CLAIMS>
A device for breaking a frangible ampoule 
comprising: 


two rigid, movable and opposing members (12,14) wherein 
each member comprises a forward end (16), a rearward end 

(18) and at least one sidewall (19) comprising an inner 
surface (25), an outer surface (24) and an edge (26); 
a cavity (29) between said opposing inner surfaces 
(25) of said members (12,14); 
an ampoule (40) associated with said cavity (29); 
a gap (28) between said opposing edges (26) of said 
members (12,14) that is less than the thickness of said 

members; 
means connecting said rearward end (18) of said 
members (12,14) such that said inner surfaces (25) oppose 

each other and said edges (26) oppose each other; and 
 
   wherein said members (12,14) are spaced sufficiently 

from one another to surround said ampoule (40) and said 
gap (28) is maintained between said edges (26) such that 

when said members (12,14) are compressed, said edges of 
said members are brought together to substantially 

eliminate said gap (28), said cavity (29) is reduced and 
said ampoule (40) is ruptured. 
The device of Claim 1 wherein said means for 
connecting said rearward ends of said members is a living 

hinge (20). 
The device of Claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
sidewalls (19) of said members (12,14) are curved in 

shape.  
 
The device of Claim 3, wherein said sidewalls 
(19) of said members (12,14) are the same or symmetrical 

in shape. 
An apparatus for collecting and transporting 
biological specimens comprising: 


an elongated housing (32) having an open end (36) and an 
opposite closed end (35); 
a specimen collector (34) disposed within said housing 
comprising a cap (44), a shaft (45) connected to said cap 

(44) and a swab (46) connected to said shaft; 
 
and a device for breaking according to one of Claims 1-4, 

comprised within said housing (32). 
The apparatus of Claim 5, further comprising a 
second breaking device (77) and a second ampoule (75), 

positioned within said housing (32a) and adjacent said 
first breaking device. 
The apparatus of Claim 5 or 6 wherein said 
ampoule (40) comprises a test reagent for detecting and 

identifying microorganisms. 
The apparatus of one of Claims 5-7, characterized 
by its use for collecting and transporting biological 

sample with the following steps: 

(a) contacting a sampling site with said swab 
(46); 
(b) obtaining a specimen from said site with 
said swab;  

 
(c) inserting the swab (46) with the specimen 
into said housing (32); 
(d) closing said housing (32) with said cap (44) 
to protect said swab (46) and said specimen 

from the environment external of said 
housing; 
(e) reducing said cavity (29) and substantially 
eliminating said gap (28) of said breaking 

device (10) by applying force to said outer 
surfaces of said members (12,14), such that 

edges are brought together and said cavity is 
reduced and said first ampoule is ruptured; 
(f) releasing medium into said housing (32), and 
(g) subjecting said specimen to said medium.
