<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to block copolymers, containing at least 
one block predominantly derived from a vinylaromatic monomer and at 
least one block predominantly derived from a conjugated diene, and 
more particularly to block copolymers which have shown an 
attractive sensitivity to radiation curing and to radiation curable 
sealant, coating and/or adhesive compositions containing said block 
copolymers. More in particular the invention is relating to pressure 
sensitive adhesive compositions containing these block copolymers 
and providing attractive high temperature resistance even after low 
radiation dosages, whereas the tack properties remain unchanged. From the middle seventies several efforts were made to come to 
block copolymers giving improved properties to adhesive 
compositions which should be economically processed into their end 
user form, i.e. giving an optimum balance between processing speed 
(throughput) and final adhesive properties. Such efforts can be derived from e.g. U.S. patents 
Nos. 4,152,231; 4,163,764; 4,391,949 and 4,444,953. U.S. patent No. 4,152,231 disclosed a cured polymer 
composition possessing attractive cohesive strength at high 
temperature, prepared by the radiation curing of a polymer 
composition in an inert atmosphere, the polymer composition 
comprising: 
(a) 100 parts by weight of a linear or radial conjugated diene 
polymer selected from the group consisting of homopolymers of 
C4-C12 conjugated dienes, and the hydrogenated derivatives 
thereof; (b) from 0 to about 250 parts by weight of a tackifying resin; and  
 (c) from about 1 to about 100 parts by weight of a di- or tetrafunctional 
acrylate or methacrylate selected from the group 
consisting of the acrylic and methacrylic acid esters of 
polyols. The polymers to be used as component (a) were taught in column 
5 to be preferably consisting of a nucleus of a coupling agent or 
residue and a number of arms of substantially linear unsaturated 
polymers extending outwardly therefrom, the number of arms varying 
between 2 and 30 and preferably between from about 7 to about 15. Star-shaped block copolymers to be applied could be 
represented by the formulae A-X(A)n and (AB)-X-(B-A)n, wherein n 
was an integer usually between 2 and 30 and wherein X was a 
coupling agent nucleus, preferably being a poly(vinylaromatic 
coupling agent) nucleus and more preferably a poly(divinyl benzene) 
nucleus. According to column 6 of said patent (lines 33-38) star 
polymers to be used should have peak molecular weights
