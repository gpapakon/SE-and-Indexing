<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for relatively rotating the shaft (10) of an internal combustion engine with respect to the driving wheel (24) rotatively arranged on the shaft has a hydrostatic pump (21) whose housing (21A) is rotationally secured to the camshaft (10). Within the driving wheel (24) and pump (21) is located an electromagnetically actuable control valve (13, 13') which controls the hydraulic connections between the pump and the regulating device (rotary piston control) (17), i.e. puts pressure on or relieves the pressure chambers (25A to 27A, 25B to 27B), so that the camshaft is accordingly rotated with respect to the driving wheel. The electromagnet (72) of the control valve (13, 13') is actuated by means of a controller (73) influenced by sensors. The hydraulic medium is supplied to the regulating arrangement through a bore (11) in the camshaft (10). A very compact adjusting device is thus obtained for the camshaft.
