<ABSTRACT>
Process for the removal of chlorine-containing impurities, for example chloropentafluoroethane, and/or hydrofluoroalkane impurities, for example 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, from pentafluoroethane which comprises contacting the impure pentafluoroethane with hydrogen at elevated temperature, for example 350-600  C, in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst, for example palladium-on-carbon, to convert the impurity or impurities to a hydrofluoroalkane and/or a hydrocarbon.

<DESCRIPTION>
PURIFICATION OF PENTAFLUOROETHANEThis invention relates to a process for the purification of pentafluoroethane and in particular to a process for the removal of chlorine-containing impurities and/or hydrofluoroalkane impurities from compositions containing pentafluoroethane .Recently, processes have been proposed for the production of pentafluoroethane which has been proposed, together with other hydrofluoroalkanes such as 1 , 1 , 1 , 2-tetrafluoroethane , difluoromethane and 1 , 1, 1-trifluoroethane , and blends thereof as a suitable replacement for chlorofluorocarbons due to the zero ozone depleting potential of hydrofluoroalkanes .Thus it has been proposed in Japanese Patent Application Nos Kokai 3099026, 1258632 and 4029941 to produce pentafluoroethane by contacting pentafluorochloroethane with hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst. Suitable conditions of temperature and pressure and suitable catalysts are described in the aforementioned Japanese patent applications. However, these and other processes for the production of pentafluoroethane result in a product comprising pentafluoroethane together with impurities such as unconverted starting material and by-products .Many of these impurities may be difficult to separate from pentafluoroethane by conventional processes, for example distillation, due to the similarity in boiling point between the impurity and pentafluoroethane , and/or the formation of pentafluoroethane/impurity azeotropes .We have now found a simple process for the removal of such impurities from pentafluoroethane, by converting the impurities to a hydrofluoroalkane 

and/or hydrocarbon which is easily separable from pentafluoroethane .According to the present invention there is provided a process for the removal of chlorine-containing impurities and/or hydrofluoroalkane impurities from pentafluoroethane which comprises contacting the impure pentafluoroethane with hydrogen at elevated temperature in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst to convert the impurity or impurities to a hydrofluoroalkane and/or a hydrocarbon.The process may be operated so as to remove chlorine-containing impurities from the pentafluoroethane to the extent that the composition recovered after the process contains less than 1Z by volume of chlorine-containing impurities, preferably less than 0.5Z, more preferably less than 0.1 and especially less than 0.01Z of chlorine-containing impurities. Similarly the process may be operated to remove hyrofluoroethane impurities to below the level of 1Z
