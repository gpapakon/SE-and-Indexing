<ABSTRACT>
An automatic apparatus and relevant method for 
discovering and designating air targets constituted by 

a transmitter assembly (11) which can be associated with a 
radar (20) and connected via radio with a portable receiver 

assembly (12). The portable receiver assembly (12) is further 
constituted by a headset unit (13), an auxiliary terminal (15) 

and a receiver unit (14) with a satellite system and data 
processing electronics. 
The headset unit (13) comprises an earphone (17) and a 
Magnetic North sensor (18) and is connected with the 

receiver unit (14). The portable receiver assembly (12) can 
orient an operator, by means of audio signals, towards 

the direction of provenance of a selected target and 
supply her/him with information relevant to said 

target by means of sound messages, e.g., digitalized 
voice.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic
apparatus for discovering and designating
air targets and its use.Modern combats are characterized above all by a
high mobility and a large dispersion of units on
battle field. As a consequence, the anti-aircraft
systems are required to secure, or meet, determined
requisites, such as, e.g., minimal values of reaction
time, action starting time and intervention time. The
same systems must simultaneously achieve the highest
levels of precision and effectiveness degree.Furthermore, the possibility of frequently
modifying the deployment without discontinuing the
system operativeness must be provided.All the above can only be secured by those
systems which are capable of automatically solving,
within reduced times and with the required precision
level, the problems of position determining and
direction orienting.The apparatuses which are known from the prior
art and are presently used to constitute such systems,
compute and process the received data, in an
autonomous mode. The results of these analyses are
ususally reported in alphanumerical mode and are then
either displayed on suitable displays, or printed.
Inasmuch as not always such results are end values,
they require the operator to perform data and
cartographic analyses, with consequent time losses.WO 88/02841 relates to an apparatus according to the
preamble of claim 1. An orientation device including
a magnetic sensor arranged in an
item of headgear worn by an
observer and adapted to provide the
observer with alignment data is known from EP-A-503214. The novel apparatus according to the present
invention aims hence at solving these drawbacks, by
supplying the operator with an immediate answer, or
information data, without that said operator must
perform any further analyses of the received data.A purpose of the present invention is of
providing a standalone and automatic apparatus which
is capable of receiving a data string from an external
source and reporting to the operator the same data, or
the apparatus operating statuses, by voice.Another purpose of the apparatus is of enabling
the position to be determined without the aid of
cartographic procedures and known points. It
furthermore should be capable of supplying the
operator with orienting data referred to a precise
reference direction.The apparatus must furthermore be capable of
determining, by using suitable algorithms, the most
dangerous menace and hence commanding, by means of
audio signals, the operator orienting towards the
direction where

<CLAIMS>
Automatic apparatus for discovering and designating
air targets constituted by a transmitter assembly (11)

which can be associated with a radar (20) and can be
connected, via radio, with a receiver (12), said

receiver comprising an auxiliary terminal (15), a
receiver unit (14) and data processing electronics (24),

characterised in that said receiver unit (14) comprises
a satellite system (26), said receiver assembly (12) is

a portable receiver assembly and further comprises a
headset unit (13) comprising an earphone (17) and a

Magnetic North sensor (18), being suitable for being
connected with said receiver unit (14), and said

receiver unit (14) and said headset unit (13) are
suitable for orienting an operator (31), by means of

audio signals, towards the direction of provenance of a
selected target (27), and supplying her/him with

information relevant to the same target (27), by means
of sound messages. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized
in that said apparatus is capable of selecting air

target (27) relatively to two zones (29, 30), one of which is a
discovery zone (29) and the other one is an engagement

zone (30).
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized
in that said audio signal is a stereo signal which is

emitted, when the target (27) is within the engagement
zone (30), only from one side of said earphone (17), thus

determining the direction of rotation of said operator (31)
towards said target provenance direction.
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterized
in that the amplitude and frequency of said audio 

signal decrease as said target provenance direction is
approached by the operator (31).
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterized
in that an absence of said audio signal indicates that

said operator (31) is exactly oriented towards said target
provenance direction.
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterized
in that when said audio signal is absent, the operator (31)

receives information as to the characteristcs of said
target (27).
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized

Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized
in that said acoustical message is an information as

to a certain residual time for fire opening action.

in that it is suitable for selecting a higher-priority

target at any time, and for sending a relevant signal

Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized
in that it is suitable for being connected with a

computer and is suitable for supplying various
information as to the target (27).
Use of the apparatus according to
claim 1 in a target engagement

sequence comprising the following steps:

target discovery step;
step of transmission of data relevant to target
discovery;
step of supplying the operator (31) with the
information of target presence, by means of

acoustical messages;
step of operator orienting by means of said audio

step of signalling target characteristic
