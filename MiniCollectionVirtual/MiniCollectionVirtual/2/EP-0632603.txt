<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mobile
satellite communication system, and more particularly, to
an antenna apparatus provided at a mobile station for
communication with a satellite.In a mobile satellite communication system such
as MSAT, where communication is carried out between a
mobile station and a satellite, a prior art antenna
apparatus provided at the mobile station is comprised of a
single antenna element, to thereby obtain a compact
configuration. Such a single antenna element is a
helical-type mast antenna whose beam direction can be
adjusted by changing the length or pitch of a helical
conductor element. Therefore, when the mobile station
moves thus changing its location, a beam direction
of the antenna element always must face the
satellite.On the other hand, generally, in a mobile
satellite communication system, a transmitting frequency
(TX) of a signal transmitted from the mobile station is
different from a receiving frequency (RX) of a signal
received by the mobile station, to thereby avoid radio
interference. For example, the transmitting frequency TX
is 1.660 GHz, and the receiving frequency RX is 1.559
GHz.In the above-mentioned prior art antenna
apparatus, however, the beam direction of the antenna
element which is, in this case, the elevation angle of the
antenna element, is dependent upon the frequency thereof.
Therefore, when the beam direction of the antenna element in
relation to the satellite is optimum with respect to the 
receiving frequency, the beam direction of the antenna
element in relation to the satellite is not optimum with
respect to the transmitting frequency. Conversely, when
the beam direction of the antenna element in relation to the
satellite is optimum with respect to the transmitting
frequency, the beam direction of the antenna element to the
satellite is not optimum with respect to the receiving
frequency. This will be explained later in detail.DE-A-30 08 684 discloses a method and a circuit arrangement
for transmitting messages in two directions. This arrangement
is in particular intended for the control of a
rocket or similar from an aeroplane and comprises an antenna
apparatus having a receiver with a separate antenna
and a transmitter with a separate antenna. Furthermore, in
this document it is mentioned that receiver and transmitter
might be operated at different frequencies.A satellite antenna system comprising a single radiator
unit for receiving and transmitting electromagnetic radiation
is described in EP-A-540 125. The elevation angle of
