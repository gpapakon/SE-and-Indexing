<ABSTRACT>
A charging device (10) in an image forming apparatus is provided 
with an image carrier such as a photosensitive drum (12) or image 

forming medium on which an electrostatic latent image is 
developed. The charging device has a brush roller (14) for 

charging the carrier. The roller brush is rotatably mounted 
and formed with inclined fibers planted on a shaft, the 

roller brush satisfying the following formulas: 

L₂ ≦ L₁-0.5 
L₂ ≧ L₁×0.5 
wherein L represents a length of fibers and L represents a 
thickness of the brush. The charging device further has 

means (28) for removing the charges from the surface of the brush 
roller and means (28) for cleaning an area where the charges are 

removed by the charge removing means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a charging device 
for an image forming apparatus, which charges an image 
carrier, such as a photo-sensitive drum or paper, and 
more particularly to a charging roller which contacts 
the image carrier. In electrostatic recording or 
electrophotographic recording, it is known that a 
corona charger is used for charging a photo-sensitive 
drum or for transferring an image formed on the photosensitive 
drum to a recording paper. In recent years, 
since the problems have risen that corona charging 
produces ozone which is harmful to humans and that 
actions for safety must be taken because the corona 
charger needs a high voltage power supply, a charging 
apparatus without using the corona charger is desired. 
By way of an example of charging without the corona 
charger, Japanese Patent Disclosure (kokai) No. 
210862/88 discloses a brush charging roller and 
Japanese Patent Disclosure (kokai) No. 267667/89 
discloses a contact charging method for charging a 
photo-sensitive drum with a biased charging roller 
contacting to the drum surface.  However, since, this contact charging method tends to 
make the drum surface non-uniformly charged, fogging or non-uniform 
shading would appear on developed images. A reason 
why the drum surface is not uniformly charged is as pointed 
out, because the resistance of the charging roller is not 
appropriate. Although a typical electronic photo-copying 
apparatus comprises a cleaner for cleaning the surface of 
the photo-sensitive drum after developing, toner particles, 
paper, and fine particles such as silica contained in the 
toner (collectively referred to as toner particles) are not 
completely removed and left on the drum surface, whereby 
these particles may adhere to the charging roller to cause 
so-called filming phenomena that the surface of the roller 
is covered with the particles. Owing to the filming 
phenomena, the surface resistance of the roller is changed. 
The filming phenomena is remarkable in a charging roller of 
a solid roller type. On the other hand, in the case of a 
charging roller of a brush roller type, although there are 
advantages that the brush roller is inexpensive compared 
with the solid roller and high accuracy is not required 
during mounting, non-uniform charging would happen owing to 
the construction of and the method of fabricating the brush, 
and lines or marks would appear in half tone images.  An object of the present invention is to 
provide a charging apparatus for an image forming 
apparatus
