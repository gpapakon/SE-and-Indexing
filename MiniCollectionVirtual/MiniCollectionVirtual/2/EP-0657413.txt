<ABSTRACT>
Aliphatic  omega -difluorocarboxyl compounds are prepared economically from aliphatic  omega -monohalodifluorocarboxyl compounds by bringing the latter into contact at 120 to 250 DEG C with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst applied to an inert support material which contains one or more metals of group VIII of the Periodic Table.
