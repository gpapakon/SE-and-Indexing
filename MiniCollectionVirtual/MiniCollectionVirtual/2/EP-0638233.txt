<ABSTRACT>
Trap for small animals, in particular mice, with a housing (1) which can be closed by a cover (2) and which has an entrance opening (11) which can be closed by an entrance flap (3), a liquid tank (1b) and an arrangement, which can be actuated by the small animal by means of a trigger (7), for throwing a tablet (5) into the liquid tank (1b) filled with liquid (6). In a reaction with the liquid (6), the tablet (5) forms a gas which is deadly for the small animal. In order to simplify the manufacture and maintenance of such a trap, it is proposed that the throwing device has a pivotable support plate (4), on which the tablet (5) can be laid, the support plate (4) in the liquid tank (16) is arranged above the liquid (6) and that the support plate (4) can be tilted after or together with the entrance flap (3) in order to bring about the throwing of the tablet (5) into the liquid (6), the pivoting movement of the support plate (4) being coupled directly or indirectly to the pivoting movement of the entrance flap (3).

A trap for small animals, in particular mice, with a 
casing (1) which is open at the top and comprises a cage 

(1a) for receiving the small animal, which cage is 
provided with an entrance opening (11) which is closable 

by a swivellable entrance flap (3), with a lid (2) to be 
opened which can close the casing (1) and with a catching 

mechanism for introducing the small animal into the cage 
(1a), with a gassing apparatus being provided in the 

casing (1) which after the closure of the entrance 
opening (11) fills the cage (1a) with a gas which is 

deadly for the small animal and which is provided with a 
throw-in device actuatable by the small animal by way of 

a release member (7) which by throwing in a tablet (5) 
forms the deadly gas by a chemical forming a gas in 

reaction with a liquid (6) in a liquid tank (1b) provided 
in the casing (1), characterized in that the throw-in 

device is provided with a swivellable carrier plate (4) 
on which the tablet (5) can be placed, that the carrier 

plate (4) is arranged in the liquid tank (1b) above the 
liquid (6) and that the carrier plate (4) is tiltable 

after or jointly with the entrance flap (3) in order to 
effect the throwing in of the tablet (5) into the liquid, 

with the swivelling movement of the carrier plate (4) 
being coupled directly or indirectly to the swivelling 

movement of the entrance flap (3). 
A trap as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the 
swivelling axle of the carrier plate (4) is driven 

directly or indirectly by the swivelling axle of the 
entrance flap (3). 
A trap as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the 
swivelling axles of the carrier plate (4) and the 

entrance plate (3) are arranged in the form of a single 
common axle (12).  

 
A trap as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that the 
trap consists of a maximum of the four following parts, 

namely the casing (1) comprising the cage (1a) and the 
liquid tank (1b), the lid (2), and a unit (14) consisting 

of the entrance flap (3), the carrier plate (4) and the 
axle (12) jointly connecting the same, and the release 

member (7) to be actuated by the small animal for closing 
the entrance flap (3), with the closure occurring 

exclusively by the own weight of the aforementioned unit 
(14) in combination with the weight of the tablet (5). 
A trap as claimed in claim 4, characterized in that the 
lid (2) and the casing (1) are made from one piece, with 

both being movably connected to one another by a hinge 
(13). 
A trap as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the casing (1) is closeable in a 

sealed manner by the lid (2). 
A trap as claimed in claim 5 or 6, characterized in that 
the liquid tank (1b) and the cage (1a) are separated by 

means of an intermediate wall (9) of the casing (1) and 
that there is provided a connecting opening or line (8) 

arranged in the lid (2) and/or in the casing (1) and that 
the volume of the liquid tank (1b) is smaller than the 

volume of the cage (1a), so that the gas produced can 
flow nearly completely from the liquid tank (1b) into the 

cage (1a). 
A trap as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the tablet (5) comprises a salt of 

carbonic acid as the gas-forming agent, preferably sodium 
hydrogen-carbonate, and that the liquid (6) substantially 

consists of water which preferably contains an addition 
of citric acid-1-hydrate. 
A trap as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the casing (1) of the trap is 

shaped substantially in such a way that, as seen in the 
entering direction, the cage (1a) and the liquid tank 

(1b) are arranged adjacent to one another, with the  
 

entrance opening (11) being arranged directly adjacent to 
an upright edge (15) of the casing (1), preferably on the 

same frontage with a side wall (10) of the casing (1) 
partly forming the liquid tank (1b), and that the trap is 

of the type of bait-free traps. 
A trap as claimed in claim 5 or 6, characterized in that 
the release member (7) is provided with a rocker (7a) 

attached directly behind the entrance opening (11), which 
in its idle position holds the entrance flap (2), 

preferably by way of a holding bracket (7b), in the 
opened position and which under the load of a small 

animal, for example, tilts into another position and 
releases the entrance flap (3). 
A trap as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that all parts of the trap are made from 

plastic material.
