<ABSTRACT>
A solenoid valve unit is provided in the middle of the 

fuel supply path that leads to the compression space in the 
injection pump main body and the fuel injection quantity is 

adjusted through open/close control of the solenoid valve 
unit. In this fuel injection system, the plug valve is moved 

until it is seated on the valve seat during the preliminary 
injection that is performed prior to the main injection. A 

means for leaking the fuel from within the compression space 
is provided in the injection pump main body and the time 

period during which the fuel in the compression space is 
leaked via the means for leaking and the time period during 

which the fuel supply path is restricted with the plug valve 
being seated on the valve seat are combined to stabilize the 

movement of the plug valve. Consequently, an optimal small 
quantity is achieved for the preliminary injection that is 

nearly constant regardless of the rate of rotation of the 
engine. Also, if a drive pulse that closes the fuel supply 

path over the period during which the fuel is leaked is 
supplied to the solenoid valve unit, the solenoid valve unit 

needs to be operated only once and stable injection characteristics 
are achieved from the pilot injection through the 

main injection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fuel injection system
in which a solenoid valve is provided in the middle of the
fuel supply path leading to the compression space of the
injection pump main body so that fuel injection to the
engine is controlled by opening and closing the fuel supply
path with this solenoid valve.Fuel injection pumps of this type in the known art include,
for example, an invention disclosed in Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication 1-151751 in which a pilot
injection is implemented prior to the main injection. In
order to achieve the main injection and a pilot injection
preceding the main injection, a solenoid valve is driven
twice during the compression feed process.To explain this by referring to the characteristics chart
shown in Figure 7 of the drawings, the drive pulse
supplied to the solenoid valve consists of a main pulse with
a long interval and a sub pulse with a short interval. The
small injection required to induce ignition of the fuel is
achieved by supplying this sub pulse. Generally, the required
quantity for a pilot injection is very small; approximately
3 - 5 mm3/st per unit stroke of the plunger. During 
the restricting process of the fuel supply path, i.e. when
the sub pulse restricts the fuel supply path, the solenoid
valve is fully lifted (full valve lift), reaching the required
quantity before it is seated. To counter this problem,
it is designed in such a manner that the supply period
of the sub pulse is shortened so that the solenoid valve
returns before it is fully lifted.Also, as shown in Figure 1 in this publication, a structure
in which a piezo element 47, for example, for opening/
closing the injection nozzle 49 is provided in addition to
the solenoid valve 7, a path 85 which communicates with the
path 83 for fuel supply is provided in the housing 11
against which the plunger 23 slides and path 87 for fuel
escape that communicates between this path 85 and the pressurized
region 17 within a specific cam angle range is
formed in the plunger 23.However, since the solenoid valve receives the instruction
to close and be reset before it is fully lifted, the
degree of lift is not stable. Because of this, even though a
pilot injection is employed to achieve good injection, the
overall result is not good because the injection quantity
fluctuates and is not stable. Moreover, with the pilot
injection adjusted simply with the momentary lift of the
solenoid, as in the prior art, when the rotation of the
engine speeds up and the main injection quantity increases, 
the
