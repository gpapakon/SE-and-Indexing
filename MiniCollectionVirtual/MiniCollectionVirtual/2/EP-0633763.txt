<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the topical use of deacylated 
glycerophospholipids and of the physiologically 
acceptable salts thereof. Particularly, the invention relates to the use of 
deacylated glycerophospholipids named L-α-glycerylphosphorylcholine, 
L-α-glycerylphosphorylethanolamine, L-α-glycerylphosphorylserine, 
L-α-glycerylphosphoryl-D-myo-inositol, 
respectively. Said compounds, in the present invention, can be 
used alone or in mixtures thereof. The deacylated glycerophospholipids are mainly 
obtained by the semisynthetic route, for example those 
preferred in the present invention are obtained by 
selective deacylation of the natural phospholipids 
extracted from soy. Glycerophospholipids are compounds widely 
occurring in nature, where they exert important biological 
functions, for example they are the main lipid 
components of cell phospholipids. The administrations thereof by the oral and 
parenteral routes, for example as diet supplements or 
as medicaments, proved to be useful in the prevention 
of the involution processes of the cell membranes, 
since they can play an important role on the biochemical 
lesions occurring on the membrane phospholipids.  
 EP-A-0255937 describes a skin-treatment product comprising 
lysophospholipids, 
 
in which 
R1, R2 are a fatty acid acyl group; X is choline, ethanolamine, serine, inositol;  
which are useful as emulsifying agents and have a good stabilizing 
action on emulsions.  
 Now it has surprisingly been found that the deacylated 
glycerophospholipids of the present invention can 
be adsorbed by the topical route, if suitably formulated, 
and this is a valuable alternative to the  
 
exogenous supply to the skin cells. Deacylated glycerophospholipids, mainly those 
preferred in the present invention, have interesting 
properties which can suitably be exploited also in the 
cosmetic field. The use of said glycerophospholipids is based on 
the fact that said compounds can be considered both as 
basic substances (for the formulation of excipients) 
and as specializing functional substances. As basic substances, they can be used, for 
example, to give wetting, antidehydrating, plasticizing, 
co-solvent and co preservative properties. As specializing functional substances, they can be 
used, for instance, as moisturizers, emollients, elasticizers, 
restitutives and the like. Said compounds can usefully be applied also to the 
hair cosmetic, for example as antistatics, restitutives, 
voluminizing agents and the like. The used concentrations of the
