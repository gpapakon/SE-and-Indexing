<ABSTRACT>
A current regulation circuit for a variable speed 
motor (112). The motor includes a stationary assembly having 

windings adapted for energization in at least one preselected 
sequence and a rotatable assembly in magnetic coupling relation 

to the stationary assembly. A power supply link connects the 
windings to a power supply (128) and includes power switching devices 

(110) for selectively energizing the windings in the preselected 
sequence by selectively connecting the power supply link to the 

windings to produce an electromagnetic field for rotating the 
rotatable assembly. The power switching devices each have a 

conducting state and a nonconducting state. The current 
regulation circuit includes a timing circuit, a current sensing 

circuit and a control circuit (142). The timing circuit defines 
preset periods during which each of the power switching devices 

may be nonconducting. The current sensing circuit senses 
current in the power supply link. The control circuit controls 

the power switching devices so that each of the power switching 
devices is nonconducting when the sensed current exceeds a peak 

current reference level during the preset periods. In this 
manner, the current regulation circuit controls current which 

circulates during periods when only one power switching device 
is conducting.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to any controllable,
variable speed motor and to a current regulation circuit for
controlling circulating currents in the motor and,
particularly, to a current regulation circuit for detecting and
controlling circulating currents in the motor with a bi-directional
current sensing circuit.A variable speed motor system according to the
present invention typically includes a brushless DC motor
having an inverter bridge for driving the motor. The inverter
bridge has a number of power switching devices with a flyback
diode coupled to each of the devices and is used to connect the
motor's windings to a power supply through a power supply link.
The power supply link has positive and negative rails
connecting the motor to the power supply. Generally, two
windings of a three-phase motor are energized at a time and the
power is pulse width modulated for control purposes. Such a
motor system provides pulse width modulation (PWM) of the power
to the windings by turning on and off one of the power
switching devices. Under the normal PWM control scheme, the
motor system turns off one device at a time which causes a
flyback current to circulate in the inverter bridge. Such
circulating currents result from energy stored in the phase
winding inductances and flow through one power device and one 
diode in the inverter bridge. In normal operation, circulating
currents decay rapidly because the motor back electromotive
force (EMF) opposes their flow. In abnormal operation,
however, circulating currents are out of position and the back
EMF voltage causes them to increase rather than to decay which
can result in damage to the current-carrying power devices as
well as to the motor's permanent magnets. A momentary
reversal of rotation at start-up or being out of position due
to a failure to properly sense rotor position are examples of
abnormal operation causing increasing circulating currents.Generally, current sensors are required in all phases
of the motor to determine what currents are in the motor.
Further, systems employing only a single current sensing
element are unable to detect circulating currents because they
cannot be observed in a shunt resistor (or other current
sensor) in the power supply link.Brushless DC motors are disclosed in U.S. Patent No.

noted the provision of an improved current regulation circuit
for a variable speed motor which permits use of a single
current sensing element; the provision of such a current
