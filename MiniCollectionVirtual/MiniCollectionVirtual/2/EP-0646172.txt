<DESCRIPTION>
 RECOMBINANT ENTOMOPOXVIRUSThis invention relates to the production of recombinant entomopoxviruses (EPV's), particularly recombinant Heliothis armigera entomopoxviruses (HaEPVs), capable of expressing heterologous DNA sequences. Particular applications of the invention include the use of the recombinant entomopoxviruses as biological insecticides and in the production of desired, biologically-active proteins, polypeptides and peptides in cell culture.Entomopoxviruses are large, double-stranded DNA viruses of insects, and have to date been described from species of caterpillars, beetles and locusts (Goodwin et al., 1991 ). The economic importance of these insect groups has led to serious consideration of EPVs as potential biological control agents, and investigation by others has documented various characteristics which support their use in this capacity. For example, while the collective EPV host range is broad, covering the important insect groups, individual EPV isolates generally have a narrow host range, allowing potentially high levels of control specificity. Additionally, vertebrates (and vertebrate cell cultures) exposed to large amounts of infectious EPV have shown no sign of infection or other discernible ill-effect (Buckner & Cunningham, 1972; angridge, 1973) .These factors confer significant potential for the use of EPV's as insect control agents. Unfortunately however, most EPV's exhibit low levels of pathogenicity. This trait, which has prevented serious attempts to develop the viruses as major commercial insecticides, may be overcome, conceivably, by the production of recombinant entomopoxviruses capable of expressing heterologous DNA sequences encoding agents toxic or otherwise deleterious to insects. 

Recombinant entomopoxviruses also hold great potential for the production of homogenous and biologically active proteins, polypeptides and peptides. Such products are presently generated either from recombinant bacteria or through the use of expression vectors in eukaryotic cells. The first method is technically more simple, but suffers from the drawback that many proteins of eukaryote origin are not correctly processed in bacteria. Without correct processing many proteins are biologically inactive, and thus of little use or value. On the other hand, production from expression vectors in vertebrate cells is traditionally more expensive, with smaller yields of protein. Some eukaryotic expression vectors (e.g. baculoviruses) also cause lysis of the host cell.In contrast to the
