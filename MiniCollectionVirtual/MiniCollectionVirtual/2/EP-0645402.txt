<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a liquid phase process for the 
cationic polymerization of C₄ hydrocarbon feedstreams comprising 

isobutene in the presence of a Friedel-Crafts catalyst to a 
polybutene having a number average molecular weight of 600-7000. 

In the process, the feedstream is pre-treated with an alkyl halide, 
eg tertiary butyl chloride, in the substantial absence of any 

hydrogen halide prior to contact with the Friedel-Crafts catalyst. 
The polybutenes produced by this process can be used to produce 

functionalised derivatives which in turn can be used as additives in 
lubricating oils.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the production 
of poly(iso)butenes from C₄ feedstreams using an (organo)aluminium 
halide catalyst in conjunction with an alkyl halide cocatalyst. It is well known to use (organo)aluminium compounds as 
catalysts for the cationic polymerisation of C₄ streams. In this 
process it is also conventional to use compounds such as HCl or 
alkyl halides as cocatalysts. In particular, an alkyl halide such as tertiary butyl chloride 
(hereafter "TBC" for convenience) has frequently been used as 
cocatalyst. Examples of such use can be found in, eg GB-A-1163339 
which describes a batch process for the production of polyisobutene 
polymers having a molecular weight between 2,000 and 4,000,000. In 
this process, the total weight of TBC used is from 0 to 4,000 ppm by 
weight based on the total charge of reactants (solvent + monomer + 
catalyst). The specification states (page 1, lines 25-29) that the 
molecular weight of the polymer diminishes as the amount of TBC 
added increases. It would also appear from the Examples that very 
low temperatures have to be used, eg of the order of -60°C or less 
in order to detect any polymer formation using TBC concentrations 
above 300 ppm. This view is emphasised in US-A-2581154 which states (column 2, 
lines 14-27) that TBC, if used at concentrations outside the range 
of 6-100 ppm, has a poisoning effect on the polymerisation 
catalyst. In any event, this reference relates to the production of 
elastomeric polymers in the molecular weight range from lubricating  
 
oil to rubber like polymers. Kennedy et al disclose in "Advances in Polymer Science", Vol 
10, (1972) in the passage bridging pages 8 and 9 that the polymer 
"initiating entity could be produced in a one-step process by 
reacting tert-butyl chloride and an alkylaluminium compound as an 
alternative to the two-step process of first generating the proton 
and subsequently protonating the olefin. Experiments substantiated 
this expectation: when a dilute tert-butyl chloride solution is 
added to a quiescent monomer/AlR₂X or monomer/AlR₃ charge in methyl 
chloride, instantaneous polymerisation commences and, under 
appropriate conditions, remarkably high molecular weight polymer is 
obtained". This article goes on to state on page 9 that "This hypothesis 
is in line with Petter's proposition (23) that cationic 
polymerisations can be initiated by carbocations generated from 
alkyl halides upon complexation with Friedel-Crafts halides". More recently, it has been suggested
