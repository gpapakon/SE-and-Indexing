An end cap for an elongate lighting fixture which 
comprises within a front surface (7) at least one through 

opening (8) providing access to electrical elements and 
provided with a detachable end cap cover (9) which is 

adjustably slidable within guideways (10), characterised 
in that the encircling side wall (15) of the end cap (6) 

comprises a visible section (16) adjacent the front 
surface (7) and, connected to it on the light fixture 

side, a guide section (17, 17') which is recessed relative 
to the visible section (16) and is capable of being pushed 

under sliding friction onto the front sides of the 
elongated lighting fixture, wherein the guideways (10) are 

arranged within the front surface (7), that at least one 
securing catch element (18) is provided in the guide 

section (17) of the encircling side wall (15), and that it 
comprises on its lower side at least two parallel crosspieces 

(19) acting as support elements which extend at 
least over the visible section (16) of the encircling side 

wall (15) and under the base of the elongat lighting 
fixture. 
An end cap according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the guideways (10) consist of two slot-shaped 

recesses in the front surface (7) which are vertical and  
 

arranged so as to extend parallel to one another on either 
side of the through opening (8). 
An end cap according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the end cap cover (9) comprises two vertically 

projecting engagement elements (11) which are arranged so 
as to extend parallel to one another along the side walls 

and which engage within the guideways (10) in the front 
surface (7) in which they are adjustably positioned, 

whereby the elements (11) extend over only a part of the 
length of the guideways (10) and engage detachably behind 

these by means of securing catches (12). 
An end cap according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the end cap cover (9) comprises a 

securing catch element (13) which detachably engages with 
an element (14) of complementary construction on the front 

surface (7) of the end cap. 
An end cap according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the securing catch element (18), 

which co-operates with a complementary recess in the base 
of the elongate lighting fixture, is arranged in the guide 

section (17) of the encircling side wall (15) on the lower 
side of the end cap.  

 
An end cap according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterised by at least one profiled locating piece (20, 

21) with locking elements (22), said locating piece (20, 
21) projecting beyond the guide section (17, 17') of the 

encircling side wall (15) and operating respectively in 
conjunction with a complementary element in the elongate 

lighting fixture. 
An end cap according to claim 6, characterised by two 
locating pieces (20, 21) with locking elements (22) which 

are arranged on the inner side at differing heights on the 
edge of the guideways (10) facing away from the encircling 

side wall (15). 
An end cap according to one of the claims 1 to 7, 
characterised by at least one further through opening (23) 

for an electricity cable preferably located in the base. 
An end cap according to one of the claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the through opening (8) is circular 

in shape. 
An end cap according to claim 9, characterised in 
that the through opening (8) has a diameter suitable for 

the insertion of a starter element.  
 
An end cap according to one of the claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the through opening (8) is intended 

for the insertion of a contact element for a system plug 
for the connection of the elongate lighting fixture with 

a distributing element or a second light fixture. 
An end cap according to one of the claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the through opening (8) is a 

connector socket.
