<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus (10) for dispensing web material from a coreless roll 
(40) of such 

material includes a rotatable shaft (14) having a helical-shaped 
projection (22) on the 

outer surface (20) thereof. The projection (22) resists end-wise removal 
of the roll (40) from 

the shaft (14) as long as the shaft (14) is free to rotate. A lock 
arrangement (32) is provided 

to prevent rotation of the shaft (14) after the roll (40) has been 
substantially depleted so 

that end-wise removal of the roll (40) can be manually accomplished.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for dispensing web material
from a roll, especially a coreless roll of such material. The invention has
particular application to dispensing paper from a coreless paper roll having a
plurality of convolutions and a central opening defined by the innermost
convolution. The apparatus incorporates structure which deters against theft
of a coreless roll until it has been substantially depleted.It is known in the prior art to form and make available coreless
rolls of toilet tissue, paper towelling and the like. Such products incorporate no
inner core and are comprised wholly of a plurality of convolutions of the paper
itself. A central opening is defined by the innermost roll convolution and the
central opening can accommodate spindles and shafts to support the roll as it
is dispensed by being unwound by a consumer.Of course, if some means is not provided to prevent end-wise
movement of the roll relative to the support spindle or shaft, the roll may be
removed in its entirety simply by manually pulling it end-wise from the spindle
or shaft.One approach for preventing end-wise removal of a coreless roll
from its support shaft is to position the roll and support shaft within the confines
of a cabinet. Cabinets, however, add to the cost of the dispenser, may be
inconvenient to service, and are not always appropriate for use. Mechanisms
have been devised in the nature of barbed shafts or spindles which will resist
end-wise removal of the roll product. While mechanisms of the type just
described are effective for preventing end-wise removal of a coreless roll from
the support shaft incorporating the barbs, the innermost convolutions of the
coreless roll may be cut or substantially damaged by the mechanism. 
Furthermore, barbs will continue to resist end-wise movement of a coreless roll
relative to the shaft incorporating the barbs until the very last convolutions of
the roll product have been dispensed due to unwinding of the roll. This may
not always be desirable, particularly in institutional settings where maintenance
personnel may wish to remove a stub (substantially depleted) roll and replace
it with a full roll.A search directed to the present invention located

Apparatus (10) for dispensing web material from a roll (40) thereof having

a central bore (42), the apparatus comprising support means (12), a shaft (14)
rotatably mounted from said support means (12) for insertion into the central bore,

roll retention means (22) for preventing removal of the roll axially from the
shaft, and manually operable release means (32) for overcoming the action of

the retention means to permit axial removal of the roll, the release means
being positioned to be shielded by the web material of the roll against manual

operation until a substantial proportion of the web material has been unwound
from the roll, characterised in that the roll retention means (22) prevents axial

removal of the roll from the shaft other than by rotation relative thereto, the
release means (32) comprising means manually operable to restrain rotation

of the shaft (14) to facilitate rotation of the roll (40) relative thereto.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein the roll retention means
(22) allows end-wise movement of the roll (40) relative to said shaft (14) and end-wise

removal of said roll (40) from said shaft (14) when said restraining means is activated
to prevent rotation of said shaft (14) relative to said support means (12) and

substantially resists end-wise movement of said roll (40) relative to said shaft (14) and
end-wise removal of said roll (40) from said shaft (14) when said restraining means (32)

is deactivated to allow rotation of said shaft (14) relative to said support means
(12).
The apparatus according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein said roll
retention means comprises a generally helical-shaped projection (22) on the

outer peripheral surface of said shaft (14), said generally helical-shaped
projection progressing along at least a portion of the length of said shaft for

engagement with a roll mounted on said shaft. 
The apparatus according to Claim 3, wherein said generally helical-shaped
projection has a sloped, ramp-like, front surface (26) for engagement

by a roll being mounted on said shaft and a rear surface (28) projecting
outwardly from said shaft outer peripheral surface for engaging a roll mounted

on said shaft and resisting movement of the roll outwardly away from said
support means.
The apparatus according to Claim 4, wherein said rear surface
of said generally helical-shaped projection defines an angle with the outer

peripheral surface of said shaft not exceeding about ninety degrees.
The apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein said
restraining means includes a movable lock element (32) connected to said

shaft (14) and rotatable with said shaft, said lock element being movable
between a first location wherein said lock element engages said support

means (12) and prevents rotational movement of said shaft relative to said
support means and a second location wherein said lock element is disengaged

from said support means and allows rotational movement of said shaft relative
to said support means.
The apparatus according to Claim 6, wherein said lock element
comprises a manually actuatable detent member, said support means defining

an indent (36) for selectively receiving said detent.
The apparatus according to Claim 7 wherein said manually
actuatable detent member is covered by the web material until substantial

depletion of said coreless roll whereby said manually actuatable detent
member can only be manually actuated after the roll on the shaft has

been substantially depleted. 
The apparatus according to Claim 8, wherein said apparatus
additionally comprises a plate (30) connected to said shaft adjacent to said

support means and rotatable with said shaft relative to said support means,
said manually actuatable detent member being connected to said plate and

rotatable therewith.
The apparatus according to Claim 8, wherein said indent is radially
spaced from said support shaft.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim having disposed on
the shaft thereof a roll (40) of web material for dispensing.
Apparatus according to Claim 11, wherein the roll is coreless.
