general formula (3) (wherein OR₁ represents a protected hydroxyl group; CO₂R₃ represents an esterified carboxyl 

group; and X and Y represent each independently alkyl, alkenyl, aralkyl, aryl, alkylthio, alkoxy, heterocycle, acyl, 
amino, hydrogen or halogen, or alternatively X and Y are combined together to represent cycloalkan-2-on-2-yl) by

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing 4-substituted azetidinone derivatives which are
important as synthetic intermediates, for example, for
carbapenem based antimicrobial agents.There have already been reported several useful
processes (for example, JP-A-61-207373) for producing
azetidinone derivatives represented by the general formula
[1] :

   (wherein OR1 is a protected hydroxyl group; R2 is a
substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, substituted
or unsubstituted alkenyl group or substituted or
unsubstituted aromatic group).
To produce from such azetidinone derivatives of the general
formula [1] 4-substituted azetidinone derivatives
represented by the general formula [3]:

   (wherein OR1 is as defined above; CO2R3 is an
esterified carboxyl group; X and Y are the same or
different and represent individually a substituted or
unsubstituted alkyl group, substituted or
unsubstituted alkenyl group, substituted or
unsubstituted aralkyl group, substituted or 
unsubstituted aryl group, substituted or unsubstituted .
alkylthio group, substituted or unsubstituted
alkenylthio group, substituted or unsubstituted
aralkylthio group, substituted or unsubstituted
arylthio group, substituted or unsubstituted alkyloxy
group, substituted or unsubstituted alkenyloxy group,
substituted or unsubstituted aralkyloxy group,
substituted or unsubstituted aryloxy group,
substituted or unsubstituted silyloxy group,
substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group,
substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic-thio group,
substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic-oxy group,
substituted or unsubstituted acyl group, substituted
or unsubstituted ester group, substituted or
unsubstituted thioester group, substituted or
unsubstituted amide group, substituted or
unsubstituted amino group, hydrogen atom or halogen
atom, or cooperate with each other to form a
substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkane-2-on-1-yl
group),
it has been necessary to oxidize the sulfide group of the
azetidinone derivative of the general formula [1] to
thereby convert the group to the more readily removable
sulfone group or substitute an acyloxy group for the
sulfide group.In order to convert the azetidinone derivative of the
general formula [1] to the corresponding sulfone-containing
derivative, there is known a method utilizing peroxyacid
(Yoshida et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 29, 2899 (1981)),
while a method using a mercury compound (Yoshida et al.,
Chem. Pharm. Bull., 29, 2899 (1981)) is known for the
conversion of the same to the
