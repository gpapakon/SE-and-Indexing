<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to computers, and 
more particularly to a graphics processor with improved 
calculation capabilities. In order to communicate with a user, a computer must 
be able to output information to a display. In a graphics system, the display is defined by an 
array of pixels. For example, in a standard-mode VGA 
(Video Graphics Adapter) system, the screen is addressed 
as an array of 640 x 480 pixels. Each pixel on the 
display may be set to a desired color from a defined 
palette. Typically 16 or 256 color palettes are 
supported. The number of pixels which may be displayed 
is defined by the graphic subsystem. Typical VGA modes 
support 640 x 480, 800 x 600, and 1024 x 768 resolutions. 
VGA modes with resolution greater than 640 x 480 are 
generally referred to as "super VGA". Many of today's application programs are graphics 
intensive. For example, a computer-aided design program, 
such as AUTOCAD by AutoDesk, Inc., Sauseleto, California, 
may spend a substantial amount of time drawing a figure 
to the screen. In some cases, even a small change in the 
drawing will require the entire drawing to be redrawn.  
 
Consequently, the ability of the graphics processor to 
draw lines quickly becomes of critical importance. The problems associated with line drawing have been 
well documented for a number of years. Many of these 
problems are addressed in an article "Ambiguity in 
Incremental Line Rastering", by Jack E. Bresenham, IEEE 
CG&A, May, 1987, which is incorporated by reference 
herein. The Bresenham article describes problems in 
drawing a line using an array of pixels, since lines 
having real values between two discrete pixels will have 
to approximated using one pixel or the other. Because of 
the inaccuracies inherent in approximating the line, 
issues concerning the retraceability of lines and the 
handling symmetric figures made up of polylines become 
important. Consequently, the flexibility of a graphics 
processor, i.e., the ability of the graphics processor to 
facilitate modification of the line drawing parameters is 
highly desirable. Therefore, a need has arisen in the industry for a 
graphics processor which provides fast and flexibility 
processing of lines and polylines. In accordance with the present invention as set out in the appended claims, a method and apparatus for increasing the speed and flexibility of 
line drawing in a graphics processor is provided which eliminates substantial problems with the prior art.  
 The present invention provides
