<ABSTRACT>
A control system/method for controlling the engagement and 
disengagement of a friction master clutch (16) in an automated 

mechanical transmission system (10) is provided. The control 
system/method is effective to minimize shift transient times and to 

eliminate the occurrence of cab lurch events caused by 
premature disengagement of the master clutch during high torque 

transmission or during exhaust brake operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control system/method for
controlling the disengagement of the friction master clutch in a
vehicular automated mechanical transmission system and, in particular,
to a control system/method for controlling disengagement of the
master clutch at initiation of a shift from a currently engaged
transmission ratio into a target transmission ratio or transmission
neutral.Vehicular fully or partially automated mechanical transmission
systems are well known in the prior art. Examples of such
transmission systems may be seen by reference to U.S. Pat.
Nos. 4,361,060; 4,595,986; 4,648,290 and 4,850,236.Briefly, vehicular automated transmission systems comprise a
fuel controlled engine, a multiple speed mechanical transmission and a
selectively engaged and disengaged master friction clutch drivingly
interposed between the engine and transmission. For more rapid
downshifts, a downshift or input shaft brake is usually provided and,
for more efficient vehicle retardation, an engine exhaust brake may be
provided. A control unit, typically a microprocessor based ECU,
receives a plurality of input signals, processes the input signals
according to predetermined logic rules and issues command output
signals to various actuators such a fuel controller, a clutch operator, an
input shaft brake operator and/or a transmission operator. It is known in the automated transmission systems for the actuator
assemblies to suffer a temporary lock, which results in the inability to select
other ratios than the one currently engaged.Various solutions to this type of problem have been proposed, one such
solution is proposed in EP-A-0130812. The solution involves trying to select a
different gear to the one currently engaged, and if such selection cannot be
achieved within a pre-determined time, then either the gear selector is moved to
neutral or an attempt is made to restore the originally engaged gear. The prior art fully or partially automated mechanical transmission
systems typically operate in a shift sequence wherein the master
clutch is disengaged at initiation of shifting to assure disengagement of
the positive jaw clutches associated with the currently engaged ratio.
Disengagement of the master clutch, if premature or when the engine
brake is applied, may result in an undesirable rapid yaw in the vehicle
cab as torque in the drive line unwinds with disengagement of the
master clutch. This reaction, commonly referred to as "cab lurch" or
"cab dip" is particularly disagreeable if the master clutch
