<ABSTRACT>
To provide a device capable of 
preventing reverse charging caused by 

distributed power supplies always 
surely irrespective of the kinds of the 

power generators used for the distributed 
power supplies. An apparatus 

(24) for preventing reverse charging, 
which is provided with a first circuit 

breaker (25) for performing the connection 
and separation between an 

electric power system A and a distributed 
power supply (11), and which, 

when the distributed power supply 
(11) is disconnected from the electric 

power system A by opening a second 
circuit breaker F provided in the electric 

power system A, prevents the reverse 
charging from the distributed 

power supply (11) to the electric power 
system A by opening the first circuit 

breaker (25), comprising fluctuating 
means (20) for fluctuating the 

electric power outputted from the distributed 
power supply (11) regularly 

at predetermined periods, a fluctuation period extracting means (26, 27) for extracting the same fluctuating periods as the predetermined 
periods existing in the periods of the AC voltage outputted from the distributed power supply (11), and a judging means 

(28) for opening the first circuit breaker (25) when the fluctuation period extracting means extract the fluctuating periods regularly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reverse-charge prevention 
apparatus including a 1st breaker for connecting or disconnecting an 
electric power system to or from a distributed electric power 
apparatus, in which reverse-charge from the distributed electric 
power apparatus to the electric power system is prevented by 
switching off the 1st breaker when the distributed electric power 
apparatus is disconnected from the electric power system by 
switching off a 2nd breaker disposed in the electric power system. In recent years, in order to harness natural energy or 
improve the efficiency of energy use, there is developed an inverter 
type of distributed electric power apparatus in which direct-current 
electric power output by a solar battery or a fuel battery is 
transformed into alternating-current electric power by means of an 
inverter or a so-called "cogeneration" type of distributed electric 
power apparatus in which alternating-current electric power is 
generated by linking an engine to a generator. By connecting such a 
distributed electric power apparatus to the electric power system 
(constituted of power stations, transmission lines, substations, 
distribution lines, etc.), an electricity shortage can be filled up 
by the electric power of the electric power system to constantly  
 
supply electric power when an accident occurs to the distributed 
electric power apparatus or electric power generated by only the 
distributed electric power apparatus cannot sufficiently meet 
electric power demand. However, the following problem might occur in a case in 
which the distributed power apparatus and the electric power system 
are connected to each other. That is, there is a case in which, before construction work 
or repairs are carried out for the electric power system, breakers 
are switched off to stop supplying electric power. If the 
distributed electric power apparatus is connected to a distribution 
line, a voltage of the distributed electric power apparatus is 
applied to the distribution line so that a state of reverse-charge 
is made even if the electric power system is intercepted (in other 
words, even if a breaker of the distribution line is switched off to 
stop supplying electricity). For this reason, a worker carrying out 
the construction work or the like on the distribution line has a lot 
of danger of receiving an electric shock due to the reverse-charge. Accordingly, a method is conventionally adopted in which the 
distributed electric power apparatus is provided with an over-under
