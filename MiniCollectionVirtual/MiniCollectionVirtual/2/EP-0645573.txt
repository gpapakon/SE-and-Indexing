<ABSTRACT>
A clamped flange pipe or tube fitting (10) assembly 
includes a resilient seal ring (50) compressed in a chamber (30) 

formed by cooperating recesses in opposed flanges (18,18'). The 
chamber (30) and seal ring (50) are dimensionally related in a manner 

to produce circumferentially continuous, radially spaced 
primary and secondary seal areas (42,46) and to assure a continuous 

interior surface between the connected pipes or tubes (12,14) with 
no recesses to entrap process fluids.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention is directed toward the art 
of pipe and tube joints and couplings and, more 
particularly, to an improved flange type joint. The invention is especially suited for forming 
connecting joints in critical processing systems where 
fluid entrapment or retention within the system must be 
avoided. In such systems, it is often difficult to 
eliminate recesses or pockets that retain process fluid 
between system runs or when switching fluids in a common 
line. The problem of recesses and fluid trapping 
pockets is especially prevalent with respect to connecting 
joints which rely on resilient, elastomeric seals and 
packings. The typical prior packed joint was often 
difficult to assemble and frequently resulted in undesired 
discontinuities between the connected sections. 
Consequently, the need has existed for a joint construction 
which is easy to assemble and which does not produce 
pockets, recesses, or undesirable discontinuities which can 
trap process fluids. In packed joints of the type under consideration, 
the components must generally be axially driven together 
under relatively high force to produce the necessary 
sealing pressures. Also, the joints are typically used in 
systems where frequent disassembly for cleaning, 
maintenance, and/or system changeover. To meet the high force and rapid disassembly 
requirements, it has been the practice to use  
 
circumferentially extending, multi-section clamping rings. 
The rings sections have internal wedge surfaces that act 
against corresponding wedge surfaces on the exterior of the 
joint to drive the joint components axially together. 
Actuation of the clamp ring is generally accomplished by a 
thumb screw which pulls the sections together. While generally satisfactory, problems have been 
encountered with the clamp rings. For example, in systems 
subject to substantial vibration, loosening of the clamp 
ring and loss of sealing force has occurred. Additionally, 
the repeated high force tightening and releasing of the 
thumb screws has produced significant galling and erosion 
of the nose of the thumb screws and/or the engaged portion 
of the clamp rings. This makes it difficult to retighten 
the clamps and also generates metal particles which are 
often highly undesirable in the system environment. The subject invention provides a highly effective 
flange type, packed connection joint which eliminates 
entrapment areas. The joint of the invention provides a 
primary seal area closely adjacent the fluid flow path and 
a
