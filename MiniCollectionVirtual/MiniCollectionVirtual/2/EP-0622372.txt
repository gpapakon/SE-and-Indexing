<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides a new compound,
which we have termed Leustroducsin H, and which has the
formula (I) shown hereafter. The invention also
provides a method for the preparation of this compound,
as well as compositions and methods of therapy using
this compound.The compound of the present invention is a novel
compound which stimulates the production of blood
platelets and hence is useful in the treatment of
thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia may be induced by
various causes, such as immune abnormality or adverse
reactions after cancer chemotherapy or radiotherapy. It
is a severe disease which, if aggravated, causes
bleeding throughout the body and sometimes results in
death. At present, the only sure way to treat
thrombocytopenia is by symptomatic therapy involving
blood platelet transfusion.Various types of cytokine are known, which
compounds have a hematopoietic activity. These include
certain interleukins, for example interleukin 6
(hereinafter abbreviated to IL-6), interleukin 11
(hereinafter abbreviated to IL-11) and leukemia
inhibitory factor (hereinafter abbreviated to LIF).
Amongst other activities, these compounds are known to
stimulate the production of blood platelets and, as
such, are expected to be clinically useful [Ishibashi etal.,
Blood 74, 1241-1244 (1989); Asano etal., Blood 75,
1602-1605 (1990); Okada etal., BloodÂ·Tumor 22, 23-31
(1991)]. It has been found that the administration of these
compounds themselves to humans by various routes results
in clear Pharmacological effects, which leads to the
possible use of these compounds in therapy. However, it
is thought that these compounds are essentially produced
invivo by certain kinds of cell (e.g. lymphocytes,
monocytes, fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells and
stromal cells) through a complicated regulatory system,
and that they play homeostatic roles in the production
of various kinds of blood cell. Accordingly, if these
compounds are administered without any consideration for
the delicate balance of this regulatory mechanism,
several side effects may be observed, which may be
caused by the imbalance of this regulatory mechanism;
examples of such side effects include hepatic tissue
damage, weight loss, fever and rigor.It is also known that various kinds of
low-molecular weight immunoactivators, such as
muramyldipeptides (hereinafter abbreviated to MDP) are
capable of increasing the total number of blood
platelets [R. Nakajima etal., Arzneimittel-Forsch./Drug
Research 41, 60-65 (1989)]. It is thought that these
compounds
