<ABSTRACT>
A thermotherapy device and method for treatment of prostate tissues. The 
thermotherapy method comprises the steps of locating a cylindrical ultrasound 

transducer substantially within an applicator housing, dimensioning the 
cylindrical ultrasound transducer to have a radius of curvature larger than 

a radius of curvature of the applicator housing, and providing a power source 
for the ultrasound transducer to produce a focused energy field.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a apparatus and method for 
performing a thermotherapy patient treatment protocol. More particularly, the 
invention relates to a novel apparatus and method for irradiating and/or heating 
internal organs, such as the prostate gland, for therapeutic purposes. Thermotherapy treatment is a relatively new method of treating diseased 
and/or undesirably enlarged human tissues. Hyperthermia treatment is well known 
in the art, involving the maintaining of a temperature between about 41.5° through 
45°C. Thermotherapy, on the other hand, usually requires energy application to 
achieve a temperature above 45°C for the purposes of coagulating the target tissue. 
Tissue coagulation beneficially changes the density of the tissue. As the tissue 
shrinks, forms scars and is reabsorbed, the impingement of the enlarged tissues, 
such as an abnormal prostate, is substantially lessened. The higher temperatures required by thermotherapy require delivery of 
larger amounts of energy to the target tissues. At the same time, it is important to 
shield nontarget tissues from the high thermotherapy temperatures used in the 
treatment. Providing safe and effective thermotherapy, therefore, requires devices 
which have further capabilities compared to those which are suitable for 
hyperthermia. Though devices and methods for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia have 
evolved dramatically in recent years, significant improvements have not occurred 
and such progress is badly needed. As recently as 1983, medical textbooks 
recommended surgery for removing impinging prostatic tissues and four different 
surgical techniques were utilized. Suprapubic prostatectomy was a recommended  
 
method of removing the prostate tissue through an abdominal wound. Significant 
blood loss and the concomitant hazards of any major surgical procedure were 
possible with this approach. Perineal prostatectomy was an alternatively recommended surgical 
procedure which involved gland removal through an incision in the perineum. 
Infection, incontinence, impotence or rectal injury were more likely with this 
method than with alternative surgical procedures. Transurethral resection of the prostate gland has been another 
recommended method of treating benign prostatic hyperplasia. This method 
required inserting a rigid tube into the urethra. A loop of wire connected with 
electrical current was rotated in the tube to remove shavings of the prostate at the 
bladder orifice. In this way, no incision was needed.
