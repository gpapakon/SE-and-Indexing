<ABSTRACT>
The use of aqueous hair conditioners which contain a combination of cellulose-based cationic polymers with zwitterionic polymers makes the hair very easy to comb when wet at the same time as their combability when dry is moved into an optimum range for keeping the hair-style.

characterized in that the cationic polymers are cellulose derivatives and do

not contain any imidazolinium groups and in that the zwitterionic polymers
consist essentially of


(α) monomers containing quaternary ammonium groups corresponding to
general formula (I):

the monomer (α) is acrylamidopropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride while

the monomer (β) is acrylic acid or an alkali metal salt, particularly the sodium
salt, of acrylic acid.
A preparation as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
the number of monomers (α) in the zwitterionic polymer is greater than the

number of monomers (β).

zwitterionic polymers and
0.01 to 10% by weight and more particularly 0.01 to 5% by weight of
cationic polymers,

it also contains a surfactant.
A preparation as claimed in claim 7, characterized in that the
surfactant is a cationic and/or nonionic surfactant.
A preparation as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that
the preparation has a pH value of 2.5 to 7 and, more particularly, in the range

claimed in any of claims 1 to 9 is applied to the hair.

subsequently rinsed with water or with a preparation essentially containing

water.
