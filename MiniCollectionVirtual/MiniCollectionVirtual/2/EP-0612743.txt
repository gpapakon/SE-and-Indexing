<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel oxazolidinedione 
derivative which has the effect of lowering blood sugar 
and lipids in blood, to a method of producing the said 
derivatives, and to an agent for the therapy of diabetes, 
which is useful in the field of pharmaceuticals. As remedies for diabetes, various biguanide 
compounds and sulfonylurea compounds have so far been 
proposed and used. However, biguanide compounds are 
hardly used at present, since they cause lactic acidosis, 
while sulfonylurea compounds, which have a strong action 
of lowering blood sugar, often cause severe hypoglycemia, 
requiring special precautions in use. On the other hand, various thiazolidinedione 
derivatives and oxazolidinedione derivatives are known to 
lower blood sugar and blood lipids, and to be 
substantially free of such drawbacks. Thus, for example, JPA H3(1991)-170478 and 
WO9202520-A1 describe, as 2,4-oxazolidinedione 
derivatives having substituents at the 5-position, a 
series of 5-(substituted benzyl)-2,4-oxazolidinedione 
derivatives; JPB S62(1987)-30993 describes 2,4-oxazolidinedione 
derivatives substituted with alicyclic 
groups at the 5-position; and JPB S63(1988)-35632 
describes 2,4-oxazolidinedione derivatives substituted 
with, among others, a substituted aromatic ring at the 5-position. EP-A-0 428 312 describes compounds which can be used 
as hypoglycemic and hypocholestermic agents. The 
compounds disclosed are according to formulae (I) and 
(II):  
 
 
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof wherein the 
dotted line represents a bond or no bond; R is cycloalkyl 
of three to seven carbon atoms, naphthyl, thienyl, furyl, 
phenyl or substituted phenyl wherein said substituent is 
alkyl of one to three carbon atoms, alkoxy of one to three 
carbon atoms, trifluoromethyl, chloro, fluoro or 
bis(trifluoromethyl); R1 is alkyl of one to three carbon 
atoms; X is O or C=O; A is O or S; and B is N or CH. U.S. patent no. 5,037,842 also discloses compounds 
which have use as hypoglycemic agents. The compounds 
disclosed are of formula (I): 
 
or a pharmaceutically acceptable base salt thereof wherein 
R is alkyl having one to six carbon atoms, cycloalkyl 
having one to six carbon atoms, furyl, thienyl, phenyl or 
substituted phenyl wherein said substituent is alkyl of 
one to three carbon atoms, methoxy, trifluoromethyl, 
chloro, or fluoro; X is hydrogen, methyl, methoxy, chloro 
or fluoro; and Y is O or S.  
 In our study of 2,4-oxazolidinedione derivatives, 
we have found that certain novel
