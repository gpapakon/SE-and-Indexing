<ABSTRACT>
An every course hose (10) is produced by knitting 
substantially exclusively a covered elastic yarn (1) into 

the leg portion (15) knitting fabric thereof. A covering 
yarn (3a) is wound around an elastic yarn (2) as the core yarn 

to form the covered elastic yarn (1). The covering yarn (2a) 
is constituted of a plurality of filaments made of a 

polyamide substantially free from titanium oxide and 
having a flat cross section with a flatness (b/a) (the 

ratio of the length b to the width a) of 2.0 to 6.0.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to hosiery and a
process for producing the same, and more particularly
to an every course hose having a leg portion knitting
fabric formed by knitting substantially exclusively a
covered elastic yarn and a precess for producing the
same.Recent years have seen a remarkable innovation of
panty hose, i.e., rapid shift from panty hose produced
using the conventional false-twist nylon yarn to panty
hose produced using a covered elastic yarn constituted
of an elastic polyurethane yarn and a nylon yarn
twisted around the elastic polyurethane yarn. The
panty hose produced using a covered elastic yarn have
gained public favor since they have not only excellent
close fitting properties due to recovery of the
elastic polyurethane yarn after elongation thereof but
also good durability.In the case of panty hose produced using the
conventional covered elastic yarn, however, the yarn
is knit alternately with a nylon yarn to present the
problem of weft bar due to alternate course knitting.
As a countermeasure for obviating such weft bar, the
so-called every course hose have recently been 
proposed, wherein a leg portion knitting fabric is formed by knitting only a covered
elastic yarn.Since, however, the covered elastic yarn has a structure wherein a nylon yarn is
twisted around an elastic polyurethane yarn, it is liable to become so coarse as to have
disadvantages such that the resulting hosiery is poor in transparency, stuffy, large in
fabric thickness, etc., as compared with the conventional hosiery produced using a false-twist
yarn or a composite fiber. In the case of an every course hose, these disadvantages
are increased with additional grave demerits of lost luster feeling and poor flat feeling.As a measure for solving the foregoing problems use of a finer covering yarn in a
covered elastic yarn has been proposed. Specifically, the fineness of the covering yarn
has been considerably reduced to about 7.8 to 11.1 dtex (7 to 10 deniers) as against
about 13.3 to 22.2 dtex (12 to 20 deniers) as the fineness of the conventional false-twist
yarn for hosiery.However, this has not necessarily been an effective reform measure because the
reduction in the fineness of the covering yarn involves not only a practically
unfavourable problem of deteriorating the durability of hosiery but also other problems
of an 
increased cost and a lowered productivity in the
process for producing the covering yarn. An increase
in the number of windings in covering (count of
covering twist) is effective in
