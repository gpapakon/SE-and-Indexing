<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the manufacture of soft, absorbent 
tissue paper webs and particularly to formulations for creping 
such webs to obtain improved softness in the web while increasing 
operational efficiency. The creping of paper webs by removing them from a heated 
surface, usually a rotating drum, with a doctor blade to impart 
softness to the web is well known in the art. The benefits and 
difficulties encountered in such a process have been extensively 
discussed in the prior art, notably, Grossman, U.S. Patent 
4,063,995, issued December 20, 1977. The creping process depends 
upon controlling the adhesion of the web to the heated surface. 
Many adhesive formulations have heretofore been proposed. The 
present invention relates to creping adhesives which are applied 
to the creping drum, and more particularly to formulations 
comprising a water-soluble adhesive. See for example Grube et 
al, U.S. Patent 4,304,625, issued December 8, 1981, wherein the 
water soluble component is polyvinyl alcohol. The creping 
adhesive tends to coat the dryer with a hard and uneven film 
which builds up as drying and creping proceed, resulting in 
uneven creping and rapid wear of the creping blade itself. See 
Grube et al at Col. 2, lines 25-30. In many cases, a cleaning 
blade is used to scrape the film from the drum surface. These  
 
cleaning blades must be changed frequently. Additionally, they 
cause creping surface wear. It has further been found that the addition of a phosphate 
salt to the creping adhesive formulation greatly reduces the 
problem of the hard film build-up on the creping surface. Chen 
et al, U.S. Patent 4,883,564 issued November 28, 1989. While the 
addition of a phosphate salt to the formulation reduced the need 
for changing blades and resulted in more even creping, 
practitioners have continued to desire greater heat stability of 
the creping adhesive, more tolerance of moisture variations in 
the paper web, longer crepe blade life and stronger adhesion of 
the paper web to the creping surface. This invention relates to the manufacture of creped tissue 
products, such as facial tissue, bathroom tissue (toilet paper), 
paper towels and the like. Such tissue products typically have 
a basis weight of 9 to 32 grams per square meter and are referred 
to hereinafter as "tissue products". In the creping process, a 
paper web is adhered to a rotating cylinder (Yankee drum) and 
removed (creped) with a doctor blade. Adhesion of the web to the 
rotating cylinder is generally augmented by

<CLAIMS>
A process of treating a paper web by applying an adhesive 
formulation to a creping surface and creping the web from said 

surface, characterized in that said process comprises employing 

an adhesive formulation comprising a water soluble binder and a 
polyhydric alcohol taken from the group consisting of pentaerythritol, 

di-pentaerythritol, trimethylolpropane and di-trimethylolpropane 
said polyhydric alcohol being present in an 

amount upt to 30% by weight of the solids content of the 
adhesive. 
The process in accordance with Claim 1 wherein the water 
soluble binder is polyvinyl alcohol. 
The process in accordance with Claim 2 wherein the adhesive 
formulation further includes potassium polyphosphate. 
The process in accordance with Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein 
the polyhydric alcohol is pentaerythritol. 
The process in accordance with Claim 1 wherein the polyhydric 
alcohol is trimethylolpropane.
