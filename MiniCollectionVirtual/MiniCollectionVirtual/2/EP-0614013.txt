<ABSTRACT>
A liquid-ring pump unit (60) comprises a drive motor (72) for a liquid-ring pump (62), a first container or container section (70) has a reservoir for a sealing liquid (working liquid). The pump unit (60) is of essentially cuboid shape. At least part of the external faces (74) of the pump unit (60) is formed by wall sections (75) of the containers or container sections (66, 70). The pump unit (60) is suitable, e.g., for generating a rough vacuum in industrial installations in which oil-free delivery of a gas, low-noise and low-maintenance operation, and compactness are important.

<CLAIMS>
Liquid ring pump (1; 20; 25; 30; 50; 60) 
having the following components: 


a drive motor (71), 
a liquid ring pump (3; 62) which is to be driven 
by the drive motor (71), 
a first container (26; 31) or container part (4; 
21; 56; 66) as separator for separating a sealing 

liquid of the liquid ring pump (3; 62) from a 
gaseous medium to be conveyed, 
a second container (27; 32) or container part (5; 
52; 70) as storage area for the sealing liquid 

(14), and 
a cooler (72) to cool the sealing liquid, 
wherein 
the pump (1; 20; 25; 30; 50; 60) has a 
substantially square form, 
at least a part of the outer surfaces (17; 34; 54; 
55; 74) is formed by wall parts (18; 35; 56; 57; 

75) of the first container (26; 31; 41; 46) or 
container part (4; 21; 56; 66) and/or of the 

second container (27; 32; 42; 47) or container 
part (5; 52; 70), 
the first container (26; 31; 41; 46) or first 
container part (4; 21; 56; 66) has a substantially 

square form and an entry connection piece (67) for 
the medium (10) mixed with the sealing liquid (14) 

and an exit connection piece (69) for the medium, 
the second container (27; 32) or container part 
(5; 52; 70) likewise has a square form and is 

connected to the first container (26; 31) or 
container part (4; 21; 56; 66), 
 
characterized in that the first container (26; 31; 41; 

46) or container part (4; 21; 56; 66) and the second 
container (27; 32; 42; 47) or container part (5; 52; 

70) are arranged at right angles to each other, wherein  
 

the liquid ring pump (3; 62) and the drive motor (71) 
coupled coaxially with the liquid ring pump (3; 62) are 

substantially arranged in the area which, with the 
addition of the two containers (26; 31; 41; 46 and 27; 

32; 42; 47) or container parts (4; 21; 46; 66 and 5; 
52; 70) becomes a square, wherein the first container 

(26; 31; 41; 46) or container part (4; 21; 56; 66) is 
connected to the second container (27; 32; 42; 47) or 

container part (5; 52; 70) directly or with the 
insertion of a pipeline (28; 33; 43) or suchlike. 
Pump according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the first container (26; 31; 41; 46) forming the 

separator or container part (4; 21; 56; 66) is arranged 
above the drive motor (71) and the second container 

(27; 32; 42; 47) forming the storage area or container 
part (5; 52; 70) is arranged at the side of the drive 

motor (71). 
Pump according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the second container (32) or container part (5) is 

arranged approximately centrally below the upper first 
container (31) or container part (21) and in that a 

respective drive motor (71) for a liquid ring pump (3) 
is arranged in the areas formed to the side of the 

second container (32) or container part (5). 
Pump according to claim 1, characterized in 
that at least one baffle (68) is arranged in the flow 

path between the entry connection piece (67) and the 
exit connection piece (69). 
Pump according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the cooler (72) is arranged 

approximately in the axial extension of the drive motor 
(71) at its side opposite the liquid ring pump (62). 
Pump according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that at least one of the outer 

surfaces (17; 34; 54; 55; 74) is formed by a wall part 
(18; 56; 57; 75) extended beyond one of the containers  

 
(31) or container parts (4; 51; 52; 66).
