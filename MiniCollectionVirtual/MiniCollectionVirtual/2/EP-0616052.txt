<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for selectively 
electroplating apertured products. The products are masked in accordance 

with the intended plating and subsequently exposed to an electrolyte in 
order to electroplate the products. For masking purposes a fully closed 

photoresist layer is electrophoretically applied to the products, and after 
drying of the photoresist layer, the products are covered with a photomask 

in accordance with the locations to be plated, after which exposure takes 
place. The
n the photoresist layer is partially removed, whilst the 
remaining part of the photoresist layer remains behind on the products, 

to serve as a mask for the metal products upon electroplating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for selectively electroplating 
apertured metal or metallized products obtained by stamping or etching, 
wherein a fully closed photoresist layer is electrophoretically applied 
to the apertured products, and wherein after drying of the photoresist 
layer, the apertured products are covered with at least one photomask at 
desired locations, followed by exposure of the products covered with (a) 
photomask(s), after which the photoresist layer is removed, by means of 
a developing process, from the parts of the apertured products to be 
electroplated after removal of the photomask(s), whilst the remaining part 
of the photoresist layer on the apertured products serves as a mask for 
the metal products upon electroplating those parts of the apertured 
products from which the photoresist layer has been removed. In the industry use is frequently made of metal or metallized 
products, which for technical and/or economic reasons must be selectively 
electroplated, mostly with a precious metal. Generally it is required 
thereby that said electroplating must take place as accurately as possible 
on the intended places, since plating of non-intended parts may lead to 
malfunctions when the product is being used and/or to undesirable 
consumption of the costly plating material. Figure 1 shows a typical example of such a product in the shape 
of a metal frame which is known per se, a so-called leadframe 1, with 
parts of leadframes contiguous thereto. Such leadframes are usually stamped 
or photochemically etched from a metal band or strip or obtained by 
photochemically etching of a metal foil applied to a film of plastic 
material. Figures 2 and 3 likewise show products known per se, which are 
interconnected in endless product bands or strips, Figure 2 showing an 
example of products 2 used for transistors and Figure 3 showing an example 
of products 3 used for contact systems. These products have parts, which are indicated by hatched portions 
in Figures 1 - 3), which are to be plated with a metal. It is also possible 
that only a small part of a surface must be plated, for example the part 
indicated by black planes in Figure 3. Furthermore these products are 
provided with a larger or smaller number of apertures 4, which at least 
partially surround the areas to be plated with a metal.  
 Although it will also be possible to use the method and the 
apparatus according to the invention to be described hereafter for products 
such as those shown in Figures 2 and 3, the
