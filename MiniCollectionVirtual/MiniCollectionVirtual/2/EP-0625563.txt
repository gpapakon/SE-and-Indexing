<ABSTRACT>
High viscosity functional fluids prepared by reacting a polyglycerol 
with a triglyceride oil or fat. The reaction 

products can be used as high viscosity lubricants or blended 
with triglyceride-based functional fluids for use in mud 

drilling, as low temperature lubricants, cutting fluids, 
hydraulic fluids, and food grade lubricants.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to biodegradable functional 
fluids or modifiers for functional fluids such as cutting 
fluids, hydraulic fluids, chain saw fluids, and H-1 (i.e., 
food grade) lubricants. It is known to use polyols and natural fat- and oil-based 
products as lubricants. For instance, U.S. Patent No. 
4,885,104 discloses metalworking lubricants composed of a 
reaction product of natural fat or oil, a polyol having from 
5 to 15 carbon atoms and a dicarboxylic acid having from 2 
to 36 carbon atoms. The natural fat of the composition may 
be canola oil. A food grade lubricant is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 
5,185,091. The lubricant is preferably composed of decaglycerol 
monostearate, a triglyceride of a medium chain saturated 
fatty acids (of 6 to 10 carbon atoms) and glycerol. 
The ingredients are melted and then kneaded under rapid 
cooling in order to produce a desired emulsion having a specific 
dropping point. This product is hydrophilic and substantially 
insoluble in triglyceride oils.  It is also known that polyglycerol esters can be used 
as lubricants, and find utility in the textile arts. One drawback of vegetable oil-based or esterified lower 
molecualr weight polyglycerol-based compounds as lubricants 
is their low viscosity profile, which limits their range of 
usefulness. The viscosity of vegetable oils may be increased 
in a variety of ways including bodying (i.e., a controlled 
oxidation, sulfurization (as disclosed in U.S. patent No. 
4,885,104) and blending with synthetic oils. Another possibility 
is to use synthetic polyol esters of polyhydric alcohols 
such as pentaerythritol, neopentyl glycol and trimethylol 
propane in total or in combination with vegetable 
oils (see again, U.S. patent No. 4,885,104). Although biodegradable, 
such esters are still relatively low in viscosity 
and as such, are limited in utility. Higher viscosities 
may be achieved by using dibasic acids to increase molecular 
weight, but biodegradability suffers and the economic 
and environmental considerations for using such lubricants 
become increasing less attractive. A second drawback as noted above is the insolubility of 
such products in functional fluids. The Applicant has unexpectedly and surprisingly found a 
simple solution for improving the viscosity profile and solubility 
of biodegradable functional fluids without affecting  
 
the biodegradability thereof; the solution of the 
technical problem includes reacting polyglycerols with fatty 
acids, triglyceride oils or fats and/or blending the
