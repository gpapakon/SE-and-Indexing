<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to differential bus drivers for use in, for example, 
communication systems. The driver achieves highly symmetrical wave forms at the 

output stage for both high and low side drivers. In addition, the layout of components of 
the high and low side drivers is substantially identical which allows production of the 

driver as an integrated circuit with a simple layout.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to Differential Bus Drivers for use in, for
electronic communications systems.In electronic communication systems such as, for example, Automotive multiplex
wiring, computer interfaces, etc, there are often one or more data buses connecting
subcircuits of the system. In order for a signal to be transmitted from the data buses to
either internal or external subcircuits of the system, Bus drivers are generally utilised.
One such type of Bus driver circuit is a Differential bus Driver.Differential bus drivers are generally incapable of producing symmetrical outputs
when operating with both current sink and current source capabilities. In addition, the
circuitry required to facilitate the two types of capabilities is often fairly complex in
layout and design.In US-A-4 959 561, there is described an output buffer
circuit using separate high and low driving circuits of
complementary design and as set out in the preamble portion of Claim 1. In each driving circuit a
monitoring transistor receives the same drive signal as the
output transistor and a load resistor of the monitoring
transistor provides feedback to the drive signal conductor
through a gate also receiving an input data signal. In the
case of the high driving circuit the gate is a NAND gate
and in the case of the low driving circuit the gate is a
NOR gate. The feedback to the drive signal conductor
serves to reduce the effect on the buffer circuit of a
disturbance on the power supply line to the circuit.Accordingly one object of the present invention is to
provide a differential bus driver which achieves highly
symmetrical waveforms. Another object of the invention is to provide a
differential bus driver which is as applicable to voltage
mode interface standards such as RS422 Controller Area
Network (CAN), Automotive Multiplex Wiring System (Abus) as
it is to current mode standards like Vehicle Area Network
(VAN).According to the present invention there is provide a
bus driver circuit as defined in Claim 1. Reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings,
in which:
Figure 1 is a circuit diagram of a low side driver according to the present
invention;Figure 2 is a circuit diagram of a high side driver according to the invention; andFigure 3 is a circuit diagram of a preconditioning circuit for the driver of Figure 1
or Figure 2.The circuits of Figure 1 and 2 show respectively an output driver with current
sink capability (low side driver) and output driver with current source capability (high
side
