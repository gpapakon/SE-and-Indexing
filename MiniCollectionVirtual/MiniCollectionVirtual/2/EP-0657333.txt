<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an acceleration determining system for use in
an automotive vehicle, the system comprising: a wheel speed output means for
outputting a wheel speed by measuring a rotational speed of at least one of vehicle
wheels, an acceleration detection means for detecting and outputting an acceleration
applied to the automotive vehicle, an estimated vehicle acceleration output means
for outputting an estimated vehicle acceleration estimated from the wheel speed, a
correction quantity computing means for computing a variable correction quantity
for each calculation cycle, and a zero correction means for correcting the
acceleration. Such an acceleration determining system is disclosed in EP-A-0 492
642.In a wheel behavior control apparatus for anti-locking, etc.,
estimation of the vehicle speed which is the basis for computing slippage or spin,
and that of the coefficient of friction between tires and the road surface, are
important factors on which the control performance is directly depends. The
estimation of the coefficient of friction between the tires and the road surface is
normally calculated from an estimated value of the vehicle acceleration reached
during control, and the estimated value of the vehicle acceleration is computed
based on the estimated value of the vehicle speed. Accordingly, the performance
of the vehicle behavior control apparatus greatly depends on the accuracy of the
estimated vehicle speed.Incidentally, if the vehicle speed is estimated only from the wheel
speed, the accuracy in the estimation is markedly deteriorated when an excessive
slippage or spin takes place on the wheels. Therefore, if the estimated vehicle speed and acceleration are
obtained based on the information of both the acceleration detected by a reliable
accelerometer and the wheel speed, the accuracy m the estimation can be
remarkably improved. For the accelerometer, a gravitational accelerometer is
generally employed. However, as schematically shown in Fig. 15, although the
acceleration sensor of the gravitational accelerometer is arranged to convert the
amount of displacement of a weight or pendulum F arising from acceleration, into
electrical signals by using resistors, piezoelectric elements, differential transformers,
etc. for detection of acceleration, it is difficult to avoid influences due to
fixing accuracy, and somewhat long-term variations such as electrical drifts and
gain fluctuation, etc., as well as influences due to inclination or gradient of road
surface in
