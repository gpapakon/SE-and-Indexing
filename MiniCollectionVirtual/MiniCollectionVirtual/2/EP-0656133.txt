<ABSTRACT>
A controller including a piston (13) with a hollow rod (21) extending through an inner partition wall (6) defining a high pressure chamber (3) and an inner chamber (5) and co-operating with a valve seat (24) arranged inside the high pressure chamber (3) on a sealing member (25) in one end (2) of the controller body. The inner chamber (29) is in communication with a side chamber (9) separated from the outside by a membrane (10). Both chambers (9 and 5) are filled with an incompressible fluid (29), typically a silicone oil, which transmits the pressure of the surrounding medium to the piston (13). The controller may be used in underwater breathing apparatuses, especially for cold water diving.

Gas pressure controller, comprising, in a body (1), a
first chamber (3) communicating with an inlet (7) connectable

(8) to a pressurized gas source, a second chamber (5)
separated from the first chamber (3) by a wall (6) through

which a passage (4) passes and which is closed by a piston
means (13, 15) integral with a hollow rod (21) sliding in

leak-tight manner in the passage (4) and comprising an end
extending in the first chamber (3) and forming a valve element

cooperating with a valve seat (24) arranged in the first
chamber (3), the piston means (13, 15) being stressed in the

direction opposite to the valve seat (24) by a spring (28)
arranged in the second chamber (5) and resting on the wall

(6), a third chamber (17) separated from the second chamber by
the piston means (13, 15) and communicating with at least one

outlet (18) connectable (19) to a user circuit and with the
hollow rod (21), and a fourth chamber (9) emerging towards the

exterior of the body (1), externally delimited by a flexible
wail (10) and communicating with the second chamber (5), the

second (5) and fourth (9) chambers being filled with a
substantially incompressible fluid (29), characterized in that

the valve seat (24) is carried by a shutter element (25)
externally delimiting the first chamber (3) and mounted in an

end (2) of the body (1), and in that the fourth chamber (9) is
formed in a lateral zone of the body (1).
Controller according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
fourth chamber (9) is formed substantially opposite the

pressurized gas inlet (7).
Controller according to Claim 2, characterized in that the
fourth chamber (9) communicates with the second chamber (S) by

means of an opening (12) in the wall (6).
Controller according to Claim 3, characterized in that the
wall (6) is formed in a single piece with the body (1). 
Controller according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that the hollow rod (21) cooperates with a

seal (22) retained in the wall (6) by a ring (23) stressed by
a spring (26) extending in the first chamber (3) and resting

on the valve seat (24).
Controller according to Claim 5, characterized in that the
valve seat (24) is formed by an element of plastics material

housed in a central recess of the shutter element (25).
Controller according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that the piston means comprises a piston (13)

sliding in the second chamber (5) and a diaphragm (15)
internally delimiting the third chamber (17).
Controller according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that the fluid (29) is a silicone oil.
Controller according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that the pressurized gas is a breathing gas

for divers.
