<ABSTRACT>

subscriber unit (10; OSU) in a central office and a 

plurality of optical network units (20
i
; ONU) in customer 
premises each coupled with said subscriber unit (10)

switched to a predetermined related network unit, and

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
transmission system for communication between two stations
through an optical transmission means, in particular,
relates to such a system for a communication between an
optical subscriber unit in center office (OSU) and a
plurality of optical network stations (ONU) in customer
premises coupled with said OSU through an optical means.An OSU is a center station, and an ONU is a user
station.Conventionally, a passive double star (PDS) system
has been known for time division multiplexing (TDM)
communication through an optical means between a center
station and a plurality of user stations.Fig.16 shows such a PDS system, in which an optical
star coupler 1 which is a passive element is located at a
joint portion, and a center station 2 is coupled with a
plurality of user stations 31 through 3n through said
coupler 1. In said PDS system, a time compression
multiplexing (TCM) is used for time division multiplex of
an upward signal (U1, U2, Un) from a user station to a
center station, and a downward signal (D1, D2, Dn) from a
center station to a user station. Simultaneously, a time 
division multiple access system (TDMA) is used for
multiplexing a plurality of upward (downward) signals from
(to) a plurality of user stations.In a TDMA system, a transmission time between a
center station and each user station is measured at
beginning of communication so that transmission timing and
communication capacity are assigned to each user station
with no overlap of signals of the user stations. Each user
station sends an optical signal at assigned timing, the
optical signal is multiplexed passively in the optical
star coupler 1, and the optical signals of each user
stations locate on a time axis at a receive point of the
center station 2. Similarly, a downward signal from the
center station 2 to each user stations is splitted in the
star coupler 1 so that each splitted signal is sent to
each user station, which takes only a time slot addressed
to the own station in the time division multiplexed
signal.The conventional PDS system has the disadvantage that
a downward signal from a center station to user stations
is attenuated in a star coupler depending upon number of
user stations, since a star coupler is a passive optical
coupler in which a splitted signal is subject to
attenuation relating to number of splitted channels.
Similar attenuation would occur in an upward signal in a
star coupler. Therefore, the requirements for optical
devices for transmission power, receive
