<DESCRIPTION>
 Peptide compounds having therapeutic activityThis invention relates to peptide compounds having therapeutic activity (in particular feeding inhibition), their use as pharmaceutical and cosmetic therapeutic agents, and s formulations comprising them.CCK-8 (a peptide having the structure Asp-Tyr(S03H)-Met-Gly-T -Met-Asp-Phe-NH2) is known to have feeding inhibition properties [see for example J E Morley, Minireview: 'The ascent of cholecystokinin - from gut to brain', Life Sciences, vol 30 (6), pp479-493, o 1982].International Patent Application WO 91/08225 (to Fisons Corporation) discloses a number of peptide compounds which are indicated for use in the inhibition of feeding.s A group of peptide compounds have now been found which are particularly advantageous.According to the present invention, there is provided a compound of formula I:whereinR1 is OH or OS03H;M is Met, Ahx or He;G is Gly or Sar;X is Met, Ahx, He, Phe or Lys(R2);J is Asp, Asp(OBn), Dasp, MeAsp, or MeDAsp;L is Phe or MePhe;R2 is a group of formula II, 
wherein E is NH, CH=CH or CH2CH2; and R3, R4, Rs, R6 and R7 are independently H, OH, halogen, alkyl C^ or OS03H; provided that when Rl is OS03H, G is Gly and: (a) J is Asp, L is MePhe and M is Ahx, then X is not Ahx; (b) J is Asp, L is MePhe and M is lie, then X is not He;(c) J is Asp, L is MePhe and M is lie, then X is not Ahx;(d) J is Asp, L is Phe and M is Met, then X is not Met;(e) J is Asp, L is MePhe and M is Met, then X is not Met;(f) J is Dasp, L is MePhe and M is Met, then X is not Met; or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof (hereinafter referred to en bloc as "the compounds of the invention").The compounds of the invention, amino acids, peptides and protecting groups are represented by symbols commonly used in the art, for example those defined by IUPAC and lUB.All optically active amino acids have the L-configuration unless otherwise indicated.Examples of symbols are given below:Ahx 2-aπώιohexanoic acidAsn asparagineAsp aspartic acidAsp(OBn) aspartic acid beta-benzyl ester Asp(OtBu) aspartic acid beta-tert-butyl esterBoc tert-butyloxycarbonylBrCH2-Pam 4-(bromomethyl)phenyl-acetamidomethylDAsp D-aspartic acid 
Tyr(S03H) O-sulphotyrosineThus, Hpa(S03H)-Met-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-MePhe-NH2 is the compound of formula I in which R1 is OH, M is Met, G is Gly, X is Met, J is Asp and L is MePhe:
 By Lys(R2) we mean a lysine residue in which the ε-amino group forms an amide bond with a group of formula II, as defined above. Two particular groups of formula II which may be mentioned
