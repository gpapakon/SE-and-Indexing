<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to matching of the running radius of carbon brushes to the commutator. The technical solution is based on this matching being achieved by measures which increase the wear of the carbon brushes and attempts to limit these measures exclusively to the carbon brushes and to control them exactly in terms of time and of temperature. This problem is solved according to the invention in that the commutator machine is operated during a first time period at a frequency in the region of harmonics until the maximum steady-state temperature is reached, and is operated during the subsequent time period from the frequency range of the harmonics applied in the first time period down to the range of the fundamental.

<CLAIMS>
A method to reduce the run-in period of commutating 
machines by temporally limited application of measures 

increasing the wear of the carbon brushes, 
characterized in that the commutating machine is 

operated during a first period at a frequency or a 
frequency mixture in the region of harmonic waves 

until reaching the maximum permanent operating temperature 
(Ï‘ max) and during the subsequent period 

in the frequency range of the harmonic waves 
applied in the first period or from this frequency 

range up to the range of the fundamental wave. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the commutating machine is operated in the 

wear-promoting range of the permanent operating 
temperature (t
B
) at a plurality of the fundamental 
frequency optionally with undervoltage, nominal 

voltage, nominal power or nominal current. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the commutating machine is operated for a 

short period with nominal power at nominal frequency 
subsequently to the run-in process. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the commutating machine is only operated in 

the first period. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the frequency or frequency mixture and operating 

voltage are the same in the first and in the 
second period.
