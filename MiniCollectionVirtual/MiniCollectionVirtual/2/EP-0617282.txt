<ABSTRACT>
A test slide (10) for performing 
diagnostic tests for detecting the presence of 

cells, their enzymes, metabolites and other 
cellular derivatives. The test slide (10) 

comprises a support strip (14), a coating (34) 
comprising a carrier and a diagnostic reagent 

disposed on the support strip (14), and a mount 
(12) comprising a front wall (18) and a rear wall 

(20). The coating (34) has the properties of being 
dry and stable, and water soluble. Further, the 

coating (34) and the diagnostic reagent are capable 
of rehydration. The support strip (14) is disposed 

between the front wall (18) and the rear wall (20) 
of the mount (12). Both the front (18) and rear 

(20) walls can have coinciding openings (28,28a) 
that overlie the support strip (14) thereby 

allowing spectroscopic, visual and microscopic 
examination of the support strip (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a test slide 
for performing diagnostic tests. Planar slides and cards are used to 
perform diagnostic tests, including blood, urine 
and sputum chemistry tests, as well as blood 
typing. Similar layered devices containing 
immobile nutrient components are used for culturing 
microorganisms. The cards and slides commonly 
contain a protective cover to protect and preserve 
the specimen or culture media during incubation or 
for storage purposes. U.S. Patent 3,990,850 describes a test 
card, which includes a substrate that has a test 
surface which is substantially insoluble in, 
impermeable to, non-absorbent to and wettable by 
water and carrying a dried test reagent. An end 
flap folds over the test area to enclose and 
preserve the specimen in a blood typing test. The  
 
card has a spot of blood typing anti-serum to which 
the blood sample is added. The flap has bonded 
thereon an absorbent blotting paper around the test 
area. The results may be viewed through a 
transparent plastic opening or window in the now 
folded flap. U.S. Patent 3,996,006 shows a test sheet 
which includes a sheet underlying openings in the 
front panel. Reagents are added to the paper 
sheet. The sheet may be divided into test 
sections. The '850 and '006 test slides are also 
described as useful for immunological tests. The manufacture of these devices, if 
mentioned, is by spotting the test reagents in the 
reaction area and drying the test card. During 
manufacture, each card must be handled 
individually. For example, U.S. Patent 4,668,472 
generally describes manufacturing by forming cups 
or wells into which the reagents are dispensed. 
The forming, filling and drying operations can be 
performed on the same machine, with wells of the 
reagent prepared and cut out for assembly. 
Although this may streamline the manufacture, it 
limits the flexibility of manufacturing and leads 
to variability, that is, non-uniform reaction 
surface preparation.  U.S. Patent 4,565,783 describes a device 
for culturing and observing microorganisms which 
may also be used for microbiological tests using 
antibiotics. A substrate is coated with an 
adhesive and a water soluble powder, which includes 
a nutrient or gel, which is adhered to the 
adhesive. A cover sheet protects the culture and 
microorganism from contamination during incubation 
and growth. The device also includes an opening 
with limits for retaining fluid. This device is 
useful where incubation is required and where 
liquids are added. The
