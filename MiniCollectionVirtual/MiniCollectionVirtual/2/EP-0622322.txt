<ABSTRACT>
In a folding device for rotary printing machines, the object consists in introducing a first transverse fold into signatures (5) at high production speeds whilst avoiding damage to the product. According to the invention, this takes place in that at least one single-step device (22, 27) is arranged between the collector drum (18) and the folding jaw cylinder (31) to reduce the speed of signatures. The inertia forces occurring are thus reduced as well as the negative influences of the whip effect at high speed.

<CLAIMS>
A folding device for rotary printing machines having a means 
for reducing the transport speed of signatures (5) on their path 

from a collecting cylinder (18) having signature gripping systems 
(19) to a delivery means (43, 44), characterized in that there 

are provided downstream of the collecting cylinder (18) 

a) at least a first transfer cylinder (22) having only 

controlled gripper systems (23), 
b) a gripper and folding knife cylinder (27) having folding 
knife systems (29) and gripper systems (28), 
c) a folding jaw cylinder (31) having folding jaw systems (32), 
 
and in that the gripper and folding knife cylinder (27) and the 

downstream folding jaw cylinder (31) are arranged such that they 
may be driven at a lower peripheral speed than the first transfer 

cylinder (22). 
A folding device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
a further transfer cylinder (49), having only gripper systems, 

is provided between the transfer cylinder (22) and the gripper 
and folding knife cylinder (27), and in that the further transfer 

cylinder (49) is arranged such that it may be driven at a 
peripheral speed which is lower than that of the first transfer 

cylinder (22) upstream thereof (49). 
A folding device according to one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the transfer cylinder (22; 49) is 

constructed to have four fields and has two diametrically 
arranged gripper systems (23) at the periphery. 
A folding device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that a collecting cylinder (18) having seven 

gripper (19) or spur systems is arranged upstream of the transfer 
cylinder (22; 49).  

 
A folding device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the gripper and folding knife cylinder (27) 

cooperates with a six-field folding jaw cylinder (31), and in 
that this cylinder (31) has three folding jaw systems (32). 
A folding device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the gripper and folding knife cylinder (27) 

is constructed to have six fields and has three gripper systems 
(28) and folding knife systems (29), in each case arranged 

alternately and displaced by 120° in relation to one another at 
the periphery. 
A folding device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the gripper and folding knife cylinder (27) 

is constructed to have eight fields and has four gripper systems 
(28) and folding knife systems (29), in each case arranged 

alternately and displaced by 90° in relation to one another at 
the periphery. 
A folding device according to one of Claims 1 to 5 and Claim 
5, characterized in that the transfer cylinder (49) is 

constructed to have six fields with gripper systems (23) 
displaced by 120° in relation to one another at the periphery.
