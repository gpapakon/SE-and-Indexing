<ABSTRACT>
Method and device for low emission combustion of fluid and/or gaseous fuels with internal recirculation of flue gas, particularly in water tube boilers, a first part of the combustion air being guided in a swirled manner as primary air 1 and primary air 2, coaxially with the fuel and essentially in rotational symmetry with respect to the longitudinal axis of the burner, to a primary exit position. A second part of the combustion air is guided in two stages as secondary air to a secondary exit position. The secondary air is fed in in the form of a number of free jets essentially in the direction of the primary air flow, the jets of the first stage each beginning at a first radial distance from the longitudinal axis and being set so as to converge towards the longitudinal axis, and the jets of the second stage each beginning at a second radial distance from the longitudinal axis and being guided parallel to the latter, and the radial distance of the jets of the first stage from the longitudinal axis is preferably smaller than the radial distance of the jets of the second stage.
