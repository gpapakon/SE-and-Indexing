<ABSTRACT>
A material comprising a cycloolefin copolymer has a structure consisting of alternating cycloolefin sequences and is crystalline in a temperature range of from 210 to 320@C. The cycloolefin is prepared by polymerisation of at least one polycyclic olefin, monocyclic and/or acyclic olefin with an open-chain olefin using a catalyst comprising a metallocene and aluminoxane.
