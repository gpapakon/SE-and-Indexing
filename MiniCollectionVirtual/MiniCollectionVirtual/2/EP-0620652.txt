<ABSTRACT>
A multiple slope integrating analog-to-digital converter (ADC) includes many 
improvements and refinements which eliminate timing and non-linearity errors which 

accumulate due to a large number of switching operations that occur over an integrate 
cycle. The ADC includes an integrator and a comparator in which an input voltage to be 

measured is applied to a summing node at the input of the integrator during an integrate 
cycle, while at the same time positive and negative reference currents are selectively 

applied to the summing node by a controller which monitors the output of the comparator 
in order to limit the voltage magnitude at the output of the integrator. Thereafter, during 

a de-integrate cycle, the input voltage is disconnected while progressively shallower 
ramps are measured with a high-speed clock for greater resolution and accuracy. The 

comparator has a slight hysteresis built in to slightly separate the switching thresholds for 
positive-going and negative going ramps. 
The switches which control selection of the positive and negative reference 
currents are implemented in such a way that current surges are minimized. A method 

is provided to control the order in which the switches are operated to eliminate the effects 
of charge injection due to operation of the switches as well as signals that are cross-coupled 

from the control lines of adjacent switches. 
The length of time the respective positive and negative currents are turned on 
during the integrate cycle is measured, and adjustments may be made using 

predetermined calibration factors to resolve errors in the ADC system. Thus, circuit 
parameters and values need only to be stable and not be precise, permitting the use of 

readily-available and inexpensive off-the-shelf parts and components.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to analog-to-digital converters, and in particular to 
a multiple-slope integrating analog-to-digital converter having improved accuracy and 
resolution. Conventional dual-slope integrating analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are well 
known to those skilled in the art, and operate by placing a charge on a capacitor 
associated with an operational amplifier integrator proportional to an unknown voltage to 
be measured (charging the capacitor for a predetermined period of time, resulting in the 
first slope of the dual-slope system), applying a reference voltage to discharge the 
integrator capacitor at a known rate (resulting in the second slope) and measuring the 
amount of time for discharge, and finally calculating the unknown voltage as a ratio of the 
measured time and the predetermined time multiplied by the reference voltage. Because of the long time periods and perhaps relatively high voltage headroom 
required to charge and discharge in the integrator capacitor in high resolution ADC 
systems, multiple slope integrating ADCs were devised which periodically remove or add 
known quantities of charge (represented by slopes of known polarity and duration) during 
the integrate, or charge cycle (also known as the run-up cycle) so that an unknown input 
voltage is never large enough to saturate the integrator, and a relatively small charge 
remains on the integrating capacitor to be discharged during the de-integrate, or 
discharge cycle (also known as the run-down cycle). The charge removed or added 
during the integrate cycle is kept track of by counting slopes which represent the known 
quantities of charge removed or added, and accounted for in making the final 
determination of the value of the unknown voltage. The multiple slope techniques may 
also be applied during the de-integrate or run-down cycle to shorten the amount of time 
required to discharge the integrator capacitor, resulting an ADC with increased sensitivity  
 
and speed. An example of a multiple slope integrating ADC is taught in U.S. Patent No. 
4,357,600 to Ressemeyer et al. Many of the problems associated with prior art multiple slope integrating ADCs 
stem from the large number of high-speed switching operations that occur in a short 
period of time, particularly during the integrate cycle. For example, mismatches in the 
physical characteristics of the switches themselves, however slight, will result in timing 
errors that will add up over the course of two thousand switching operations.
