<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a valve arrangement for a hydraulic delivery device, in particular for a power-steering pump, having a flow-control valve and pressure-limiting valve, which valve arrangement is distinguished in that the flow-control valve (3) and the pressure-limiting valve (5; 105) constitute two separate components of the valve arrangement (1) which are arranged in one and the same cutout (7) in the housing (9) of the hydraulic delivery device.

A valve arrangement (1) for an hydraulic conveying device, in particular for a power-steering
pump, having a flow regulating valve (3) and a pressure relief valve (5), the flow

regulating valve (3) and the pressure relief valve (5; 105) constituting two separate
components of the valve arrangement (1), the pressure relief valve (5) being connected

via a through channel (31) to the pressure supplied to a consumer means and in the end
also to a first pressure chamber (39) associated with the pressure side of the conveying

device, the flow regulating valve (3) comprising a piston (29) which can be acted upon
on the one hand by the output pressure of the hydraulic conveying device and on the

other hand by the pressure associated with the consumer means, and a connection ―
variable in dependence on the pressure ― being produced between the first pressure

chamber (39) and a channel (75) in the event of a pressure-occasioned displacement of
the piston (29) of the flow regulating valve (3), which channel (75) leads to the suction

region of the conveying device, at the same time the fluid stream to the consumer means
or to the inner chamber (43) conveyed by the conveying device being regulated in a

pressure-dependent manner, and here the pressure supplied to the consumer means being
monitored by the pressure relief valve (5: 105), characterised in that the flow regulating

valve (3) and the pressure relief valve (5; 105) are arranged in one and the same cavity
(7) in the housing (9) of the hydraulic conveying device.
A valve arrangement in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the cavity (7) is in
the form of a bore (11) open at one end, the pressure relief valve (5) being placed in the

bottom (13) of this bore (11), which bore (11) receives the flow regulating valve (3).
A valve arrangement in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the cavity (7) is in
the form of a bore (110) passing right through the housing (9) of the conveying device,

and in that the pressure relief valve (105) is housed in a stopper (71) closing the bore
(110).
A valve arrangement in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised
in that the pressure relief valve (5; 105) is connected via a through channel (31) passing

through the flow regulating valve (3) to the pressure supplied to a consumer means and 
in the end also to a first pressure chamber (39) associated with the pressure side of the

conveying device.
A valve arrangement in accordance with Claim 4, characterised in that the through
channel (31) is provided with a defined diameter-constriction (orifice (33)).
A valve arrangement in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised
in that the flow regulating valve (3) has a piston (29) movable in the cavity (7) against

the force of a spring element (helical spring (35)), a first pressure level (consumer means
and/or first pressure chamber (39)) prevailing at the first side of this piston (29), and in

that a second, lower pressure level (hollow chamber (45) and second pressure chamber
(47)) prevails at its second, opposite side, and the pressure relief valve (5; 105) is

connected to the second pressure level and is such that a connection to an even lower,
third pressure level (third pressure chamber (65)) can be opened when a predeterminable

pressure value is exceeded.
A valve arrangement in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, characterised
in that both the flow regulating valve (3) and the pressure relief valve (5; 105) are

hydraulically connected directly with a common chamber (second pressure chamber (47))
in which the second pressure level is produced.
