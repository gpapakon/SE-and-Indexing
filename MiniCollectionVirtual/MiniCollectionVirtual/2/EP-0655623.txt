<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic measurement method for distinguishing between 
unflawed and flawed parts comprises the steps of detecting at least 

two prominent resonant response frequencies, measuring the 
frequency difference between the two frequencies, determining the 

ratio of the frequency difference to one of said frequencies, and 
comparing the ratio to a predetermined part criterion. Resonant 

response frequencies dependant upon physical characteristics such 
as dimensions and weight are compared to other resonances which are 

at frequencies dependant upon stiffness of the part.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to an ultrasonic testing
device and, more particularly, to the use of a plurality of
piezoelectric sensors or transducer receiver assemblies in an
ultrasonic resonant spectrometer to measure the ultrasonic
characteristics of objects for use in testing for the presence of
imperfections in vibrated objects. The plurality of measurements
are compared to form a unique signature at a given set of
frequencies.This invention relates to investigation of specific resonant
responses and a method of qualifying parts as good or bad.It has long been attempted to test objects for imperfections
by utilizing the natural resonance of the objects when vibrated.
Particularly when the objects to be tested are mass produced, such
as ball bearings, where it is important to meet safety standards.Recent efforts have been directed to measuring objects of
known shape and frequency. See U.S. Patent 4,976,148.U.S. Patent 4,858,469 shows two receiver transducers used for
analysis of vibrations of timbers in response to vibrations and
impact. Surface and shear vibrations are detected by detection of 
the first half cycle of timber vibration. The first half cycle is
not a resonant response measurement and is the first response to an
impact.U.S. Patents 4,758,964 Bittner, 4,577,500 Mishiro, 4,603,585
Atalay, 4,212,205 West, 4,858,469 Hosgood, and 4,166,393 Lindner
are examples of vibration (or resonance) measurement with more than
one vibration sensor. DE-A-25 31 440 discloses a method of detecting faults in a ceramic part by vibrating this part
in specific directions, the frequency of this mechanic vibration being varied in a specific
range, wherein it is determined whether the vibrating part generates a basic resonant response in
a given range or not. It is an object of the present invention to provide a reliable
and cost effective means for testing objects of various shapes and
at numerous frequencies in order to detect imperfections.This object is attained by a method as defined in claim 1 and an apparatus
according to claim 16, the dependent claims 2-15 defining further
specific features of the method.Additional objects, advantages and novel features of the
invention will be set forth in part in the description which
follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the
art upon examination of the following, or may be learned by
practice of the invention. This invention provides for improved detection of flawed and
unflawed parts from a production run. In this method, the frequencies
