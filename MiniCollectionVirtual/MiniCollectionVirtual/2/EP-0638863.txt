<ABSTRACT>
In a distributed data processing system including a 
plurality of data processing request units (1-1∼1-3), a 

plurality of data processing execution units (2-1 ∼2-3), 
and a network (3) connected therebetween, each of the data 

processing request units transmits a plurality of load 
inquiry request signals (S2, S3) to the data processing 

execution units which in turn generate load response 
signals (S4, S5) showing wheir load states. Then, the 

data processing request units selects one of the data 
processing execution units having a minimum load state 

and transmit a data processing execution requesting signal 
to it, so that data processing is executed therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a distributed 
data processing system including a plurality of data 
processing request units, a plurality of data processing 
execution units, and a network connected therebetween. A prior art distributed data processing system 
includes a plurality of data processing request units, a 
plurality of data processing execution units, a network 
connected between the data processing request units and 
the data processing execution units, and a 
distribution/supervisory unit for centralized control to 
disperse the loads of the data processing execution units. In the above-mentioned prior art distributed 
data processing system, however, a protocol is required 
for interaction between the data processing request units 
and the distribution/supervisory unit, interaction 
between the distribution/supervisory unit and the data 
processing execution units, and interaction between the 
data processing request units and the data processing 
execution units, and thus, the protocol becomes complex. 
Also, the centralized control by the distribution/supervisory 
unit may cause the entire system to 
malfunction. This will be explained later in detail. It is an object of the present invention to make 
the loads in data processing execution units in a 
distributed data processing system uniform without using 
centralized control. According to the present invention, in a 
distributed data processing system including a plurality 
of data processing request units, a plurality of data  
 
processing execution units, and a network connected 
therebetween, each of the data processing request units 
transmits a plurality of load inquiry request signals to 
the data processing execution units which, in turn, 
generate load response signals showing their load states. 
Then, the data processing request units select one of the 
data processing execution units having a minimum load 
state and transmits a data processing execution 
requesting signal to it, so that data processing is 
executed therein. That is, communication between the data 
processing request units and the data processing execution 
units is established directly via the network. Thus, a 
protocol therefor is simplified. The present invention will be more clearly 
understood from the description as set forth below, in 
comparison with the prior art, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, wherein: 
Fig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a prior art 
distributed data processing system; Fig. 2 is a timing diagram showing a
