<ABSTRACT>
A circuit board comprises a carrier board which functions as a base structure to which is attached rigidly at least one electronics components card to form a wafer assembly where edge connectors to the components card are free for access, said card being attached to the carrier board by at least two rigid mechanical connectors for example glued plastic fasteners/screws or bolts, nuts and spacer means to maintain the carrier board and card at a selected separation.

<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE: CIRCUIT BOARD CONNECTIONSFIELD OF THE INVENTION: This invention relates to circuit board connections and methods of connecting circuit boards to provide circuit boards of a desirable format and to provide such boards with a rigid structure.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION: Circuit boards or cards provide the essential circuitry for many electronic products, including micro computers. Thus, the boards may bear printed circuits connecting microprocessors, transistors etc. These boards are often arranged in stacks which may be electrically connected. It may be necessary to disconnect a board and replace it if some component on the board proves faulty.Personal computer cards are of great interest to designers of equipment for technical, industrial or professional applications because of the broad range of cards available, the great variety of software and , typically, the availability of more than one source of supply. The electronic equipment on such cards is generally very good, it is only the mechanical side which causes problems.A particular problem which has developed over the years relates to variations in dimensions, for example, of personal computer cards from different sources, with respect to carrier boards so that the cards cannot be mounted in well-defined positions on the boards. This can, for example, result in mechanical instability if the computer cards cannot be attached rigidly to any brackets provided.Another serious problem which has developed relates to the lack of mechanical stability of stacks of certain circuit boards, particularly personal computers and microcomputers. For example, a personal computer card bearing printed circuits and electronic components may be "attached" to a carrier board. The "attachments"
may comprise, for example, a single, vertically-oriented bracket mounted at one edge of the computer card and the electrical connections either between individual boards or to individual boards from external power sources or peripheral items of equipment. Neither, type of "attachment" is satisfactory. Thus, the computer card may shift up and down around the point or points of attachment. Furthermore, the electrical connectors are not designed to provided stability to the structure.Another problem which occurs relates to loose cables in compartments holding circuit boards. If the circuit boards are misaligned or relatively free to move within the compartment, this looseness in itself increases the difficulty of maintenance. Even "maintenance"causes problems where the
