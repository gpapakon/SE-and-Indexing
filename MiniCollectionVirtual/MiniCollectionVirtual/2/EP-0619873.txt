<ABSTRACT>
A differential odometer includes a left wheel sensor (503) coupled to a left wheel (103), and a right wheel sensor (513) coupled to a right wheel (105). The left wheel sensor (503) provides a left wheel pulse count (505) as the left wheel (103) rotates. A left wheel distance traversed is determined by a product of the left wheel pulse count and a left distance per pulse coefficient. The right wheel sensor (513) provides a right wheel pulse count (515) as the right wheel rotates. A right wheel distance traversed is determined by a product of the right wheel pulse count and a right distance per pulse coefficient. A vehicle heading (601'), and vehicle distance traversed (1201), are determined using the left wheel distance traversed and the right wheel distance traversed. A correction value (901, 1001) is provided corresponding to a measured relationship between the left wheel pulse count and the right wheel pulse count. Then a new left distance per pulse coefficient (1105), corresponding to the provided correction value (901, 1001), and a new right distance per pulse coefficient (1101), corresponding to the provided correction value (901, 1001) are provided. Then the left distance per pulse coefficient (605) is substituted with the new left distance per pulse coefficient (1105), and the right distance per pulse coefficient (609) with the new right distance per pulse coefficient (1101). This substitution causes calibration of the differential odometer, consistent with the provided correction value (901, 1001).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the field of vehicle navigation systems, and
particularly to methods of calibrating differential odometers that are used
in such systems for determining distance traversed and heading of a
vehicle.A typical differential odometer includes a complementary pair of
sensors. Each of these are mounted near an opposing wheel of a vehicle.
Typically these wheels are non-drive powered. For instance, in a front
wheel drive vehicle, the sensors are mounted on the opposing left and right
rear wheels. Each sensor generates a series of output pulses when the
wheel, associated with the respective sensor, rotates. This series of output
pulses is further processed by computation to determine vehicular distance
traversed and heading, or differential distance traversed. Finally, with an
absolute vehicle reference, a dead reckoned position for the vehicle can be
determined.The accuracy of information regarding vehicle heading is important in
navigation systems because it effects the accuracy of the dead reckoned
position.. Because inaccuracies of the sensors are inherent, provision for
calibrating these sensors is important. If calibrated accurately, after
combining the results of the two sensors and determining distance
traversed, each wheel should indicate identical distance traversed if the
vehicle is traversing a straight line.Calibration of the differential odometer in modern navigation systems is
a manual process. Also it is done with the intervention of a vehicle
operator. The conventional method for calibrating wheel sensors requires
that an operator drive the vehicle over a straight path, carefully indicating
to his navigation system when he comes to the start and finish points on the 
calibration of the differential odometer in modem navigation
systems is a manual process. Also it is done with the intervention of a
vehicle operator. The conventional method for calibrating wheel
sensors requires that an operator drive the vehicle over a straight path,
carefully indicating to his navigation system when he comes to the start
and finish points on the path. The system can count the number of
pulses received from each wheel sensor between the start and finish
points, and calculate the distance traversed per pulse for each wheel.
Then, the system can scale the output of each wheel sensor such that the
resulting distance traversed and heading indications are corrected, or
calibrated for inherent errors.This conventional calibration method is prone to operator errors, and
it is not always
