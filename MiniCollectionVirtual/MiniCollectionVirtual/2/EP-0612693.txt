<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a process and apparatus for improving 
quality of water in easy manner and with reasonable cost and high 

efficiency. The process has steps of providing in water to be 
treated a grounding electrode (3C) and a pair of applying electrodes 

(3A, 3B), a DC voltage source (5), first and second high-frequency 
switches (6A, 6B) connected respectively to the DC voltage source 

through a variable resistor (7), a high-frequency switching commander 
circuit (11) which is a flip-flop circuit connected to the high-frequency 

switches through a resistor (12A, 12B), and a high-frequency oscillator 
(13) connected to the high-frequency switching commander circuit, 

whereby the high-frequency switching commander circuit gives 
alternately a high-frequency switching command to the first and second 

high-frequency switches, in response to a high-frequency signal from the 
high-frequency oscillator, so that the first and second high-frequency 

switches are high periodically turned ON and OFF and resulting high-frequency 
voltage is alternately applied to the pair of applying electrodes 

to decrease ORP value of the water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and apparatus for improving 
quality of water by giving electrical energy thereto and 
without using activated carbon, filter, chemicals or the like. The 
process and apparatus are suitable for improving taste of 
drinking water such as a well water and city water. Nowadays, a source of water supply has been contaminated by an 
increase of waste water from houses due to popularization of 
flush toilets and bathes, discharge of various chemicals including 
detergents, increase of water in industrial use, discharge 
of various waste water, use of various chemical fertilizers 
and agricultural chemicals, so that the quality of well 
water and city water remarkably decreases. Therefor, there is a 
strong demand on supply of drinking water excellent in safety 
and taste. As a quality modified water, hitherto, alkali-ionized water has 
been known. This water can be obtained by feeding water into an 
electrolytic cell partitioned by a diaphragm into an anode and 
cathode chambers to apply DC voltage between an anode and 
cathode in the chambers for causing a certain kind of 
electrolysis. An electrolyte such as NaCl or the like may be 
added to the water to increase an electric conductivity. An alkaline water formed in the cathode chamber has been utilized 
as a drinking water [Japanese Patent 61-101296(A) and 4-277076(A)], 
and an acidic water formed in the anode chamber has 
been utilized for sterilization purposes [Japanese Patent 1-317592(A)]. In such a conventional water treating process and apparatus, one 
of the electrodes is used as one with positive polarity, whereas 
the other with negative polarity, and therefore, the electrodes 
are gradually covered with matters deposited thereon through the 
treatment, thereby preventing transfer of electricity therebetween.  
 
For preventing the deposition, there is a way to periodically 
change the polarity of DC voltage to be applied to the 
electrodes. With the mere periodic change of polarity in DC voltage, 
however, various and different requirements depending on usage 
of water can not be satisfied and sufficient effect can not be 
obtained by a single apparatus. Further, the periodic change of 
polarity requires an extra constant-voltage circuit, low current 
circuit, polarity reverse circuit and others which increases the cost 
therefor. The conventional process utilizes the certain electrolysis unsuitable 
for treating water in large amount, and a solubility of 
minerals decreases, as pH of the water becomes 9
