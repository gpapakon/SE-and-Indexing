<ABSTRACT>
The elastic membrane described is designed as a flat, three-dimensional object. It has prominences and recesses. This makes it possible for the membrane to flex substantially free of stress, in particularly free of tensile stress, in all three dimensions simultaneously. Prior art elastic membranes of this kind suffer from the disadvantage that they cannot flex substantially free of stress, in particularly free of tensile stress, in all three dimensions and cannot therefore meet certain requirements.

Elastic membrane, characterized in that it is designed 
as a two-dimensionally formed body and has outward 

protuberances (15), all for the purpose of enabling a 
deformation simultaneously in all three dimensions which is 

substantially free of stress, in particular of tensile 
stress. 
Membrane according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the material thickness in the outward protuberances (15) is 

approximately constant. 
Membrane according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the membrane has a regular pattern of 

outward protuberances (15). 
Membrane according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the outward protuberances (15) have 

four-sided, polygonal, square, rectangular, rhombic or kite-shaped-check 
contours and indentations delimit the contours 

in a strip-like manner. 
Membrane according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the membrane has an irregular pattern 

of outward protuberances (15). 
Membrane according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the material thickness in the outward 

protuberances (15) is non-uniform. 
Membrane according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the outward protuberances are 

circular, oval or elliptical in cross section. 
Membrane according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the cross sections in two cutting 

planes at right angles to one another are identical.  
 
Membrane according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the outward protuberances (15) are 

arranged in the manner of rows, and connected, valley-forming 
indentations (19, 20) border said outward 

protuberances (15). 
Membrane according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the rows of outward protuberances (15) 

are either on the one hand parallel or on the other hand 
offset relative to one another and on the other hand define 

an angle. e.g. a right angle, with other, likewise parallel 
rows. 
Elastic membrane bellows, in particular for connecting 
two ends of rail vehicles to one another in an airtight and 

weather-proof manner, characterized in that said membrane 
bellows are made at least partially of an elastic membrane 

according to one of claims 1 to 10. 
Membrane bellows according to claim 11, characterized 
in that the bottom (6) and the top part (7) are made from an 

elastic membrane and the two side parts (4) comprise elastic 
membranes, which are corrugated in the directions of travel, 

in order in a substantially stress-free manner to absorb 
changes in the distance between the connected carriage ends 

in the direction of travel. 
Membrane bellows according to one of claims 11 or 12, 
characterized in that the maximum safe deformation of the 

membrane bellows lies in the main stress direction, 
particularly in the direction of travel or passage, of the 

bellows.
