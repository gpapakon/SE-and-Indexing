<ABSTRACT>
In an LCD or other electronic device, thin-film circuit 

elements on a substrate (100) form a sample-and-hold or other 
sampling circuit (10). The circuit (10) comprises a TFT (Ts) as a 

sampling transistor and preferably another TFT (T2) to compensate 
for displacement currents in charging and discharging the insulated 

gate (121) of the sampling TFT. Even when T2 is included, a slow 
drift in output voltage (Vo) is observed when Ts switches off, and 

this limits use of the circuit, especially in large area 
active-matrix devices. In accordance with the invention this slow 

drift is removed or significantly reduced by injecting minority 
carriers into the channel region of Ts (and T2) from a doped 

opposite-type region (119) or Schottky contact region (119) which 
is forward biased via a thin-film supply line (129). The minority 

carriers neutralise majority carriers which are being slowly 
released by thermal emission from trapping states in the TFT body.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electronic devices (for example a
liquid-crystal display or other flat panel display) comprising
thin-film circuit elements which form a sampling circuit, for
example a sample-and-hold circuit of the device. A plurality of
such sample-and-hold circuits may be integrated on the same
substrate with a matrix of cells, for supplying the sampled signals
as information to the cells. Thus, the circuits may form part of a
column driver for an active matrix addressed liquid-crystal
display. However, the present invention may be incorporated in
other types of large area electronic devices, for example thin-film
data stores or image sensors.There is currently much interest in developing thin-film
field-effect transistors (hereinafter termed "TFTs") on glass and
other insulating substrates for large area electronics
applications, for example liquid-crystal displays. Such TFTs
fabricated with amorphous or polycrystalline silicon films may form
switching elements of a cell matrix. A recent development involves
the fabrication and integration of circuits from TFTs (often using
polycrystalline silicon), for example integrated drive circuits for
the matrix of a liquid-crystal display. An important circuit
function in the column drive circuit of a liquid-crystal display as
well as in other applications is a sample-and-hold circuit
comprising a sampling transistor between an input node and a
charge-storage means.Different known examples of liquid-crystal displays having
sample-and-hold circuits in their column drive circuits are
disclosed, for example, in United States patent specification
US-A-4 870 399 (our reference PHA 21395), in the English-language
Patent Abstracts of Japan (Vol. 15 No. 245) and the Kokai drawings
of published Japanese patent applications Kokai JP-A-03-77922 and 
JP-A-03-77915, and in published European patent application EP-A-0
342 925, the whole contents of which are hereby incorporated herein
as background references.In the specific embodiment of US-A-4 870 39, high speed
sample-and-hold circuits are made as monolithic integrated circuits
in single crystal silicon material and so are separate from the
display substrate. In the displays of JP-A-03-77922 and
JP-A-03-77915, a sample-and-hold circuit comprising both a TFT and
a signal-accumulation capacitor is provided in each of the pixel
cell areas of the display. In the displays of EP-A-0 342 925, a
sample-and-hold circuit comprising a TFT is provided for each of
the column lines of the cell matrix, while the capacitance
