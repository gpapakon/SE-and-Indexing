Method for the determination of the activated
partial thromboplastin time (APTT) in a one-step

reaction,
wherein

the determination of APTT is started by contacting
a reagent which contains the substances necessary

for the APTT determination comprising an activator,
divalent cations and phospholipids in a premixed

form and which is stabilized by one or several
amino acids, with a sample liquid and determining

the APTT by measuring the clotting time.
Method as claimed in claim 1,
wherein

plasma is used as the sample liquid.
Method as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
wherein

kaolin, silicate or/and ellagic acid are used as
the activator.
Method as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
wherein

the phospholipids are obtained from animal or/and
vegetable tissue extracts or/and are produced

synthetically.
Method as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
wherein

calcium ions are used as the divalent cation. 
Method as claimed in claim 1,
wherein

the amino acids are selected from the group
comprising D-alanine, L-alanine, β-alanine, glycine

and valine.
Method as claimed in claim 6,
wherein

the amino acids are present at a total
concentration of 0.5 to 10 % in relation to the

total weight of the reagent.
Method as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 4,
wherein

the reagent is packaged or pre-dispensed in a
vessel.
Method as claimed in claim 1,
wherein

the vessel is sealed air- and water-tight.
Method as claimed in claim 8 or 9,
wherein

the closure of the vessel is composed of a seal
made of aluminium foil.
Method as claimed in one of the claims 8 to 10,
wherein

several measuring vessels are integrated into one
card. 
Method as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 11,
wherein

reagent-specific or/and batch-specific data are
stored on the vessels or/and on their holder.
Method as claimed in one of the claims 9 to 12,
wherein

the storage is on a bar code label.
Method as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 13,
wherein

the determinations are carried out in a mechanical
or optical analytical system.
Method as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 14,
wherein

the method is carried out in parallel with further
determinations.
Method as claimed in claim 15,
wherein

the further determinations comprise one or several
parameters of the coagulation system that are

selected from the thromboplastin time (PT),
fibrinogen concentration, thrombin time (TT),

reptilase time (RT), coagulation factors, protein C
and protein S.
Reagent for the determination of the activated
partial thromboplastin time (APTT) in a one-step

reaction,
wherein

it contains all substances necessary for the
determination of APTT comprising an activator, 

phospholipids and divalent cations in a premixed
form and is stabilized by one or several amino

acids.
Reagent as claimed in claim 17,
wherein

the amino acids are selected from the group
comprising D-alanine, L-alanine, β-alanine, glycine

and valine.
Reagent as claimed in one of the claims 17 or 18,
wherein

the amino acids are present at a total
concentration of 0.5 to 10 % in relation to the

total weight of the reagent.
Reagent as claimed in one of the claims 17 to 19,
wherein

it is packaged or pre-dispensed in a vessel.
Reagent as claimed in claim 20,
wherein

it comprises several vessels integrated into a
card.
Reagent as claimed in one of the claims 17 to 21,
wherein

reagent-specific or/and batch-specific data are
stored on the vessels or/and their holder.
Combination of reagents,
wherein

it comprises several vessels containing a reagent 
for determining APTT as claimed in one of the

claims 17 to 22 and optionally further vessels for
determining other parameters of the coagulation

system.
Use of a reagent as claimed in one of the claims 17
to 22 or of a combination of reagents as claimed in

claim 23 in a method in which the activated partial
thromboplastin time (APTT) is determined in a one-step

reaction in a sample liquid, in particular
blood or plasma.
