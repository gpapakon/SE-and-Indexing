<ABSTRACT>
A process and cross-winding device (3) are disclosed for laying a thread (13). The traversing thread guide is moved by an electric motor (7) and the set position of the traversing thread guide is determined by the relative position of the stator and rotor of the electric motor. According to the invention, the real position of the traversing thread guide is continuously detected by measurement means (8, 10) and transmitted to controlling means (11) which compare the real and set positions of the traversing thread guide and generate a corresponding differential signal for controlling the relative position of the stator and rotor of the electric motor.
