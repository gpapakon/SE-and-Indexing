<ABSTRACT>
A ground covering comprising releasably coupled-together hexagonal panels (1, 1a, 1b) which alternately exhibit, on their hexagon sides, hook protrusions (5) and eyelet protrusions (7) for the coupling is designed such that it does not exhibit openings either within the panels in the region of the eyelet protrusions (7) or between the panels in the region of the mutually abutting corners (3). The panels border one another in an essentially gap-free manner over the entire length of their side surface, the rounding-off radii (R1, R2) towards the panel upper side being dimensioned such that they do not hinder the pivoting movement for the coupling of the hook protrusions. Consequently, an essentially opening-free and gap-free ground covering, which is suitable as a walk-on traffic surface area, can be provided.

Floor covering made of detachably linked hexagonal tiles (1, 1a, 1b), in which 
each tile (1) has coupling projections (5, 7) on each of its six side surfaces, 

which are alternately designed as hooks (5) with a hook profile opening 
upwards and eyes (7) with a link (11) delimited in cross section by a recess 

(13) inwards and positioned on the outside, which can be hooked onto from 
below and behind by a hook and extend in the middle of the length of 

each side surface without the corners,
characterised
 in that the recess (13) delimiting the link (11) is 
designed as a pocket closed on the upper side of the tile and in that the 

coupling projections (5, 7) are designed and arranged relative to the 
connection line of the corners (3) of the tile so that in each case two coupled 

tiles (1, 1a or 1a, 1b) border one another both in the region of the coupling 
projections (5, 7) and in the corners (3) without leaving a gap. 
Floor covering according to Claim 1, 
characterised
 in that the pivot 
axis (15) defined by a link (11), about which a hook (5) is pivotable when 

coupled with an adjacent tile (1), is approximately in alignment with the 
corners (3) of the tile. 
Floor covering according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised
 in that the flat 
surface of the tile (1) passes into the side surfaces at different radii of 

curvature (R₁, R₂, R₃), whereby the radius of curvature on the side surface 

with an eye (7) has a value R₂ both in the region of the link (11) and on both 
sides thereof in the corner regions, which value is adjusted to the pivot 

movement of the adjacent tile about the pivotal axis (15), whilst the radius of 
curvature of the opposite side surface with a hook projection has a value R
1,
 
which is smaller than R₂. 
Floor covering according to Claim 3, 
characterised
 in that in the 
region of each corner (3) in cross section of the tile of the radius of curvature 

has a value R₃ which is smaller than R₁.  
 
Floor covering according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised
 in that 
the tiles are formed in one piece out of plastic. 
Floor covering according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised
 in that 
the tile surface has a slide resistant profile.
