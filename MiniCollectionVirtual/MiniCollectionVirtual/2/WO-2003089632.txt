<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are a cloned pig expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a cloned pig having a 1,3-galactosyltransferase (GT) gene knocked out. Also, the present invention discloses methods of producing such cloned pigs, comprising the steps of establishing a somatic cell line; preparing a GFP-transfected or GT gene knock-out nuclear donor cell; producing a transgenic nuclear transfer embryo using the nuclear donor cell and a recipient oocyte; and transplanting the transgenic nuclear transfer embryo into a surrogate mother pig. The cloned pig expressing GFP of the present invention is useful for large-scale production of an animal disease model, and the GT gene knock-out cloned pig can be used as a organ donor allowing xenotransplantation in humans without hyperacute immune rejection.

<DESCRIPTION>
 GFP-TRANSFECTED CLON PIG, GT KNOCK-OUT CLON PIG AND METHODS FOR PRODUCTION THEREOFTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention, in general, relates to a method of producing a cloned pig with a specific genetic character by gene targeting through introduction of a desired gene into somatic cells and somatic cell nuclear transfer, and pigs produced by such a method.More particularly, the present invention relates to a cloned pig containing a specific gene, that is, green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene that encodes a protein emitting green color at a specific wavelength of light, and a method of producing such a pig. Also, the present invention is concerned with a cloned pig in which a gene responsible for the hyperacute rejection of xenografts from pigs, that is, alpha- 1,3-galactosyltransferase (GT) gene, is knocked out, and a method of producing such a pig.In addition, the present invention relates to a gene targeting method comprising effectively introducing a GFP gene or a genetically manipulated GT gene into a cell. Further, the present invention relates to a vector capable of effectively removing aGT gene.The present invention indicates potential large-scale production of an animal disease model through successful introduction of a heterologous GFP gene into a pig, and makes it possible to produce a GT gene knock-out pig, thereby allowing pig organs to be transplanted into a human without hyperacute xenograft rejection.PRIOR ARTTransgenic animal technology has been under the spotlight for the past 20 years. The transgenic techniques are overwhelmingly important in terms of being capable of producing highly valuable products, and are widely used in biomedical and biological research. The transgenic techniques can be industrially applied in a broad range of 

applications from production of high-quality livestock products, high value-added pharmaceutically-active substances, animals having improved resistance to various pathogens and animal disease models, to genetic therapy.Owing to its properties of facilitating labeling of chromosomal proteins and tagging of a specific region of chromosomal DNA, being capable of associating with many cytoplasmic proteins and being non-toxic, green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, which is typically used at a gene targeting step to produce a transgenic animal, is widely used for expressing cognate cytoskeletal filaments in living cells. In 1994, Chalfie et al. observed various molecular biological changes in living cells including porcine embryos using GFP obtained from
