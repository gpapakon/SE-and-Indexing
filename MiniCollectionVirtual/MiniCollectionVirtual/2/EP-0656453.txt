<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a housing with wall connections, in the case of which wall elements abut at an angle. At least in the case of some of the wall connections, the wall elements are each connected to one another via an outer corner profile 10, 25, 26, 31, 32 which exhibits fastening legs 11, 12, 26, 27, 34, 35, 36, 37 which rest on the outer side of the wall elements and are connected thereto. In order that the housing has a particularly simple structure and a high strength, at least some of the outer corner profiles 10, 25, 26, 31, 32 exhibit an inner wall 15 which encloses a cavity 17, 52, 53.
