<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to synthetic
polypeptides. In particular it relates to synthetic
polypeptides which emulate the three-dimensional
structures and/or electrostatic surfaces and/or other
physical, chemical and structural properties of specific
regions of proteins thought to be the involved in the
molecular pathology of spongiform encephalopathies. It
is of particular interest to the design of
immunodiagnostics, vaccines and other medical,
veterinary or scientific agents in relation to human,
bovine and ovine spongiform encephalopathies.Spongiform encephalopathies are a group of
degenerative neurological diseases. Examples have been
found in a number of species including sheep (where it
is known as scrapie), cows (BSE) and humans
(Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and kuru) (Review
article, Taylor, D.M. Veterinary Record 125, 413-415
(1989)). Similar con itions have also been found in the
wild mink population and in captive kudus (a kind of
antelope) and tigers. It has been variously reported
that BSE can be transmitted under laboratory conditions
to mice and pigs. This crossing of species barriers by
the infective agent has led to increased concern that
transfer to humans could occur.These diseases are characterised by a slow
incubation time of four to five years after which the
clinical symptoms of progressive degeneration of mental
state, including aggressiveness and lack of
coordination, appear. Post mortems reveal a
characteristic pattern of vacuolation in brain tissue
due to the destruction of neural cells, and the
deposition of unusual protein fibres.Although the form of the disease found in sheep 
(scrapie) has been known for many years, spongiform
encephalopathies have come to prominence within the last
decade following the appearance of BSE in cattle farms.
The incidence of BSE in the United Kingdom has increased
markedly during this period and public concern over the
possible transmission of the disease to humans has led
to a collapse in the beef market. Thus for both
veterinary and economic reasons, there is an urgent need
for diagnostic agents to detect infection and for
vaccines to prevent infection.It is believed that the causative agent of scrapie
and its counterparts in other animals is a so-called
"prion", that is an infective particle comprising
protein only and no nucleic acid, the presence of the
latter being required in the case of a conventional
virus. In scrapie, one particular protein (termed prion
protein, PrPSC) has been found to co-purify with
infectivity and can
