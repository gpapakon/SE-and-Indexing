A resonance circuit (4) including a high frequency 
induction heating coil (6) is set to a resonance state 

and the heating temperature of an object (9) to be 
heated (for example, a catalytic converter) is 

controlled on the basis of the resonance frequency, 
which varies as a function of the increasing temperature 

of the object (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heating temperature
control method in high frequency induction heating and high
frequency induction heating temperature control apparatus,
and more particularly to a control method and apparatus
suitable for accurately controlling a heating temperature of
an object to be heated when a high frequency induction
heating coil is used to high frequency induction heat the
object.A catalytic converter disposed on the way of an exhaust
pipe of an automobile to purify exhaust gas is heated by the
exhaust gas to a high temperature during traveling of the
automobile and accordingly the purification of the exhaust
gas by the catalytic converter is performed effectively, but
while the catalytic converter is at the normal temperature
upon starting of an engine of the automobile
the purification is not performed effectively. Accordingly,
in order to perform the purification of exhaust gas upon 
starting of the engine sufficiently, it is necessary to heat
the catalytic converter forcedly upon starting of the engine.Thus, in a conventional heating method of the catalytic
converter, a DC current flows in the catalytic converter
directly to utilize the Joule heat. Fig. 12 illustrates a
control apparatus 50 for carrying out the conventional
heating method. The apparatus 50 serves to heat a catalytic
converter (object to be heated) 51 to a previously set
temperature.The conventional
temperature control apparatus 50 is configured to supply
electric power from a DC power supply 52 to the catalytic
converter 51 constituting the object to be heated and Joule-heat
it and to detect a heating temperature of the catalytic
converter 51 by means of a thermocouple temperature sensor 53
attached to the catalytic converter 51. The thermocouple
temperature sensor 53 produces a voltage signal proportional
to a detected temperature to supply it to a comparator 54,
which compares the voltage signal with a predetermined
reference voltage.When the temperature detected by the thermocouple
temperature sensor 53 exceeds a predetermined reference
voltage, the comparator 54 produces a predetermined control
signal. The control signal switches a power switch 55 from 
an on state to an off state to cut off supply of electric
power to the catalytic converter 51, so that heating of the
catalytic converter 51 is stopped.With such a circuit operation, the catalytic converter
51 is heated to the predetermined set temperature and is
controlled not to exceed the set temperature.In the conventional
temperature control
