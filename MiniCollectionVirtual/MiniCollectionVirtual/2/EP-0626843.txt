<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of reducing the 
adherence of bacteria to tooth surfaces, to oral hygiene compositions 
comprising solely polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) for use in such methods and to 
processes for the preparing such compositions. Bacteria present in the oral cavity, as part of the normal microflora 
thereof, may be deposited in the pellicle formed on the tooth enamel and 
then be transformed into plaque. This may in turn lead to caries, calculus 
and periodontal disease. Accordingly methods for reducing the adherence 
of bacteria to the tooth enamel should be of benefit in oral hygiene as they 
should be associated with reduced plaque formation. Agents used in such 
methods are commonly referred to as "anti-adherence" agents. Examples 
of such already in use include silicone polymers. Anti-adherence agents 
modify the tooth surfaces, thereby interfering with the normal bacterial 
absorption mechanisms. We have now surprisingly found that polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) 
has anti-adherence properties. Polyvinyl pyrrolidone has previously been 
included in oral hygiene compositions, at comparatively low levels 
(typically about 0.1%) as an auxilliary thickening agent and foam 
enhancer. In addition, PVP has been proposed for use in oral hygiene 
compositions, in dentifrices as an agent to remove stain, in particular 
tobacco stain (GB 741 315, Colgate Palmolive-Peet Co), and in conjunction 
with cblorophyll, to inhibit the formation of stain associated therewith 
(GB 739 936, Colgate-Palmolive Co). More recently, PVP has also been 
suggested as an additive for dentifrices packaged in plastics dispensers, to 
reduce the release of volatile flavour oils therefrom (US 4 590 065, 
Colgate-Palmolive Co). Polyvinyl pyrrolidone suitable for use in the present invention 
preferably has an average molecular weight in the range 5,000 to 100,000, 
more preferably in the range 5,000 to 50,000. Grades of polyvinyl  
 
pyrrolidone of average molecular weight 10,000 and 40,000 are available 
from Sigma Chemical Co whilst a grade with an average molecular weight 
of 30,000 is available from GAF Corporation. Polvinyl pyrrolidone for use in the present invention will preferably 
be presented in an oral hygiene composition further comprising a dentally 
acceptable excipient or carrier. Polyvinyl pyrrolidone is suitably present 
in at least 1%, preferably between 2 and 30%, more preferably between 5 
and 25%, advantageously between 10 and 25%, by weight of such 
composition. Oral hygiene compositions of
