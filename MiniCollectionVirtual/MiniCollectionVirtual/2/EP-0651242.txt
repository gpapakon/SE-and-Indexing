<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to detecting and locating, using acoustic acquisition, the gas leaks coming from a double-walled enclosure walls which, constitute a waveguide for acoustic waves. It furthermore relates to a device for implementing this method, which includes a plurality of antennas (15, 17, ...) arranged in the inter-wall space (7) for producing rough location of the leakage noise, each antenna including sensors capable of carrying out fine location of the leakage noise. Application to the monitoring nuclear plants.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the detection and location of gas leaks in a confinement
enclosure (1) with double walls (3, 5), characterized in that it consists of

performing, between the two walls (3, 5), an acoustic monitoring in order to
detect leak noises having a sound level above that of the background noises,

the acoustic monitoring consisting of a wide location for determining the
area of the enclosure from which the leak noises come and a narrow location

for determining the leak noises in punctiform manner within said area.
Apparatus for the detection and location of gas leaks for performing
the process according to claim 1, characterized in that it has at least two

antennas (15, 17) in the inter-wall space (7) for performing a wide location
of the leak noise, said inter-wall space forming a closed waveguide ensuring

the propagation of the leak noises from the enclosure, each antenna incorporates
a plurality of sensors performing a narrow location of the leak

noise.
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in that the sensors are
microphones.
Apparatus according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that it incorporates
processing means (24-32) connected to each sensor and located

outside the confinement enclosure.
Apparatus according to any one of the claims 2 to 4, characterized in
that each of the antennas is fixed to a robotized, mobile platform able to

move within the inter-wall space.
