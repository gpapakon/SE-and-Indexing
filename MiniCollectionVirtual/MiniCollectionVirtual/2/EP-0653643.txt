<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to method and system
for monitoring vehicles and, in particular, to method and
system for determining the position of aircraft and other
vehicles over a test range.To train combat pilots effectively, training
flights are conducted over a test range which includes
simulated missile defense systems. These simulated
missile defense systems include radar beacons which
simulate fire control radar of missile defense systems.
In order to evaluate a pilot's performance during such
training, it is necessary to monitor accurately the
position of the pilot as it travels through the test
range.U.S. Patent No. 5,144,315 (which corresponds to EP-A-0 385 600), issued September 1,
1992, entitled "System for Accurately Monitoring Aircraft
Position During Training Exercises" (the '315 patent),
discloses a system in which a conventional airborne IFF
transponder located on board an aircraft is used as a
source of tracking data. Emissions from the airborne IFF
transponder are used in an inverse Loran position
determining system for establishing longitudinal and
latitudinal coordinates for the aircraft. In the inverse
Loran positioning system, a plurality of ground receive
stations are positioned around a test range. An aircraft
flying through the test range includes a squitter
transmitter which interrogates a conventional airborne
IFF transponder. In response to the interrogation, the
transponder transmits its altitude and identity on a
continuous basis to ground receive stations in the test 
range. The ground receive stations have accurate clocks
which are synchronized with each other and which are used
to note the time of arrival of transmissions received
from the airborne IFF transponder.In the system disclosed in the '315 patent, each of
the ground receive stations is linked to a master ground
receive station through a wide-band, two-way data link.
The two-way data link enables the master ground receive
station to calibrate clocks at remote ground receive
stations as well as to receive data from the remote
ground receive stations identifying time of arrival of
transponder transmissions emitted from aircraft passing
through the test range. Using well known Loran
techniques, the master ground receive station calculates
X-Y coordinates for the aircraft using the time of
arrival information received from the remote ground
receive stations. Additionally, altitude information
which is transmitted from the IFF transponders is used to
monitor the altitude of the aircraft.As taught by the '315
