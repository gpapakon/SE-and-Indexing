<ABSTRACT>
A lignocellulose substrate based on wood containing fungal spawn for growing saprophytic fungi. The substrate is pasteurized but unsterilized and has a particle size at least 70 % between 0.5 and 2 cm. The substrate further contains linseed meal and sodium bicarbonate and is fungicide-free. The wood is green timber of which at least 90 % consists of hard wood, and is preferably untreated with pesticides. A method and apparatus for preparing the substrate, as well as a method for growing saprophytic fungi with said substrate, are also provided.

<CLAIMS>
A wood-based cellulose substrate based on stabbed wood for 
the cultivation of saprophytic fungi, which is a pasteurized but non-sterilized 

substrate, characterized in that : its granulometry for at least 
70% of its content is comprised between 0.5 and 2 cm; it contains linseed 

meal and sodium bicarbonate and is devoid of fungicide; and the wood is 
green wood composed of at least 90% of wood from deciduous trees. 
The substrate according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
wood has not been submitted to pesticidal treatment. 
The substrate according to claim 1, characterized by having a 
humidity comprised between 55% and 65%. 
The substrate according to claim 1, characterized by having a 
pH comprised between 5 and 7. 
The substrate according to claim 1, characterized in that it 
contains linseed meal in an amount of 3% to 18% based on the total 

content of dry materials. 
The substrate according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
wood is selected from the group comprising birch, alder, oak, beech, 

maple, poplar, ash and chestnut wood. 
A method for preparing a substrate according to any one of 
claims 1 to 6, characterized in that an untreated mixture constituting the 

precursor of the substrate is pasteurized at a temperature comprised 
between 70 and 100° C for 1 to 3 hours by steam injection. 
The method according to claim 7, characterized in that the 
pasteurized substrate is cooled in a sterile medium in such a way as to 

reach 25°C after 24 hours. 
A method of cultivating saprophytic fungi, characterized in that 
the substrate according to any one of claims 1 to 6 in in
oculated with 
fungal spawn in an amount of 2.5 to 12.5% of the total dry material, 

followed by incubating the inoculated substrate while maintaining it at a  
 

temperature between 24 and 30°C, and lastly allowing cultivation to 
proceed. 
The method of claim 9, characterized in that the inoculation 
takes place in a sterile room and incubation takes place during 6 to 12 

weeks in a room under controlled temperature and humidity.
