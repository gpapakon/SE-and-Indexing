<ABSTRACT>
An improved method of measuring the flow velocity of 
water bodies, characterised in that, in addition to a 

principal direct path along which acoustic signals are 
propagated across and through the direction of flow of 

water, an auxiliary indirect path for acoustic signals 
is utilised comprising two segments of an acoustic 

signal reflected at a water-air or water-ice boundary of 
said body of water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to flowmeters,
and particularly to acoustic flowmeters. More
particularly still, it relates to acoustic flowmeters
based on the measurement of propagation times across the
whole river, and which are suitable for measuring the
average flow velocity in rivers, or the like bodies of
water, in which the water level varies, and also under
ice.Supersonic flow meters are being used successfully to
determine the flow velocity of water volume in rivers
and canals. The mean velocity of water in the reference
plane of the acoustic path is determined by measuring
the propagation times of acoustic pulses in opposite
directions. In order to determine the mean velocity for
the entire flow cross-section, a correction factor (k)
must be applied. k depends on the position of the 
acoustic transducers, the flow cross-section profile,
the relative heights of the acoustic path, and the
bottom roughness. It is known that if the acoustic path
is located about 40% above the bottom, then the
correction factor becomes independent of the bottom
roughness and equal to unity. 40% above bottom is
therefore a preferred depth of installation. However,
as the water level rises, and the relative installation
level above ground falls to 20% or less, the effects of
the bottom contour become more significant and the
uncertainty in the value of the proper correction factor
k increases. The latter may be estimated by computation
using uncertain assumptions about bottom contour
variations upstream as well as about river width, which
is not satisfactory.The problem is further aggravated in winter, when k is
also influenced by the surface contour of the ice cover,
and more uncertain assumptions about the same must be
made in order to determine the new k. Errors in flow
velocity determination may, therefore, reach or exceed
40% in winter, because the logarithmic vertical velocity
distributions, which are stable in the summer with good
accuracy, are no longer stable in the winter under ice.In order to mitigate the above mentioned deficiencies, 
it has been suggested that acoustic flowmeters be
stacked vertically to measure at several planes, thereby
apprehending the different vertical distribution of flow
under ice. Such an arrangement is also likely to
improve accuracy in the summer. Practical experience,
however, shows that the complexity of such installation
is significant, and that also as a result the
susceptibility to failure is increased, the complexity
of apparatus increases proportionately with the

A method for determining the flow velocity of a body
of water flowing in a first direction, the method

comprising:

(a) emitting acoustic signals from an emitter to a
receiver;

indirect path (4) are propagated by the same signal
propagation means (1,2).

the propagation means comprises a signal transducer (1,2).
A method according to any preceding Claim,

A method according to Claim 8, characterised in that
the principal direct path (3) is arranged such that it is

A method according to any preceding Claim,
characterised in that when measuring the propagation times

of acoustic signals propagated along the principal direct
