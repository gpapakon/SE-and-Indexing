<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to storage-stable, 
silver-filled organosiloxane compositions yielding 
cured electrically conductive elastomers that retain 
their electrical properties for extended periods of 
time. The reduced variation of contact resistance and 
volume resistivity with time exhibited by our 
elastomers are attributed to the manner in which the 
silver particles are processed before incorporation 
into our curable organosiloxane composition. Elastomers, gels and resins prepared from 
curable organosiloxane compositions containing finely 
divided silver particles exhibit high levels of 
electrical conductivity and are used in specialized 
applications that require materials exhibiting heat 
resistance, flex resistance, and electrical 
conductivity. The prior art of electrically-conductive, 
silicone compositions is represented by JP-A 3-170,581 
[170,581/91]; JP-A 03-049,105 [049,105/91]; JP-A 
59-170,167 [170,167/84]; and US-A 5,227,093. Several problems are associated with the 
electrically conductive silicone rubber compositions 
taught in the publications mentioned. When silver in 
flake-form is particularly used as a filler, it has 
been found that during the storage of the composition, 
the silver flakes separate from the composition, and 
the composition curability declines with the passage of 
time. Ultimately, the composition may even become 
uncurable. Another problem is that large variations in 
contact resistance and volume resistivity can occur 
over time in the cured elastomers prepared from these 
compositions. This phenomenon can render the rubber  
 
unsuitable in use for the continuous connection of 
electrically conductive elements. We have now found that one cause of variation 
in electrical properties of silver-filled 
organosiloxane elastomers with time is the low affinity 
of silver particles for the other ingredients of the 
curable composition used to prepare the elastomer. We have also confirmed that the curability of 
these silicone rubber compositions declines with 
elapsed time due to the presence of residues of the 
lubricant which is present during grinding of the 
silver particles. These lubricant residues remain on 
the surface and/or in the interior of the particles. One or more of the following lubricants are 
used with silver particles during this grinding: 
saturated and unsaturated higher fatty acids such as 
lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic 
acid, oleic acid, arachidic acid, and behenic acid; 
metal soaps such as aluminum laurate,
