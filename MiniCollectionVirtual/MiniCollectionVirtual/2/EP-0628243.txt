<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a soilless culture system consisting of a mineral or organic substrate (1), intended to receive one or a number of young plants arranged on the upper face (37) of the substrate, the substrate being sheathed in a watertight polymer film (3), characterised in that the sheath (3) extends in the direction of the slope of the ground, on which the cake is placed, via an end (340, 310, 330, 32) comprising at least one face (340) in the continuation of the lower face (34) of the substrate (1) and of sufficient size to allow its folding over and its holding in position on the adjacent upper face (11) of the substrate in order to stop the drainage, and comprises means of keeping the drainage slots on the upper face of the substrate.
