<ABSTRACT>
An oscillator circuit provides a symmetrical signal 
without halving the frequency of a crystal oscillator 12. The 

input 14 of the crystal oscillator 12 is low pass filtered, 
and the output 18 of the filter 16 is differential voltage 

compared with the input 14 of the crystal oscillator 12. The 
output 22 of the differential voltage comparator 20 is 

symmetrical and of the same frequency as the crystal 
oscillator 12. The crystal oscillator 12 is preferably a 

Pierce oscillator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to oscillator circuits and has 
particular relation to high frequency symmetrical oscillator 
circuits. A clock signal must be very symmetrical. The conventional way 
to produce such a signal is with a crystal oscillator and a 
flip-flop. The crystal produces a fairly assymetrical signal, but 
each rising edge can be used to trigger a divide-by-two (D-) 
flip-flop. The D- flip-flop has a much more symmetrical output. However, the output of the D- flip-flop is only half the 
crystal's frequency. This presents no real difficulty until clock 
speeds approach half the frequency of available crystals. The 
present invention provides clock-quality square waves without 
dividing the crystal's frequency by two. According to the present invention, the input of the crystal 
oscillator is low pass filtered, and the output of the filter is 
differential voltage compared with the input of the crystal 
oscillator. The output of the differential voltage comparator is 
symmetrical and of the same frequency as the crystal. Figure 1 is a block diagram of the present invention. Figure 2 is a mechanization of the block diagram of Figure 1.  In Figure 1, an oscillator 10 according to the present 
invention includes a crystal oscillator 12 with an input 14. The 
input 14 is passed through a low pass filter 16, producing a 
filtered output 18. A differential voltage comparator 20 compares 
the filtered output 18 with the unfiltered input 14. The output 22 
of the differential voltage comparator 20 is at the same frequency 
as the input 14 of the crystal oscillator 12, but is much more 
symmetrical. In Figure 2, a resistor 24, crystal 26, and inverter 28 are 
placed in parallel, thereby forming a Pierce oscillator. Capacitors 
30 and 32, respectively connected to grounds 34 and 36, are attached 
to the input and output ends, respectively, of the oscillator in 
order to assure stable performance. The input 38 of the oscillator is connected to a low pass 
filter 40, preferably an RC filter comprising a resistor 42 and 
capacitor 44, the capacitor 44 being grounded by a ground 46. The 
output 48 of the filter 40 is fed to a differential voltage 
amplifier 50, the other input 52 being driven by the raw input 38 of 
the oscillator. The output 54 of the amplifier 50 is the output of 
the present invention. The present invention can be used whenever it is desired to 
produce a high frequency symmetrical clock signal. It may be made 
from components which, separate and apart from one another, are 
entirely
