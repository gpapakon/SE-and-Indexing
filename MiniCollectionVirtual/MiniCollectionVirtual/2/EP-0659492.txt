<ABSTRACT>
Epicycloidal vibrating device, characterised in that it comprises a shaft (3) rigidly fastened at one of its ends (11) to a plate (4), connected by elastic means (6) to the frame (1) of the machine, and furthermore supporting a thermoplastic piece (14), the said shaft (3) being provided near this end (11) with a magnetic excrescence (8), the rotation of which, within a plurality of magnetic fields created by the energisation of a plurality of electromagnets (7) arranged around the said shaft (3), generates an epicycloidal-type movement of the plate (4), the other free end (12) of the shaft (3) being, on the one hand, rotationally guided within the frame (1) of the machine and, on the other hand, rotationally driven by a motor (2).

Device for creating orbital vibration, characterized in that it 
comprises at least one shaft (3), integrally connected by one of 

its ends (11) to a plate (4), connected by elastic means (6) to 
the bed-plate (1) of the machine, and supporting in addition a 

thermoplastic component (14), said shaft (3) being provided, at 
the level of this end (11), with a magnetic excrescence (8), 
the 
rotational movement of which within a plurality of magnetic fields 

caused by the energizing of a plurality of electromagnets (7) 
disposed around said shaft (3), creates a movement of the epicycloidal 

type of the plate (4), the other free end (12) of the 
shaft (3) being, on the one hand, rotationally guided within 

the bed-plate (1) of the machine and, on the other hand, rotationally 
driven by a motor (2). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the connection 
between the plate (4) and the shaft (3) is realized by means of 

a coupling element (5), notably of the swivel or cardan type, 
combined with an element allowing the translation of the shaft 

along its axis, notably of the guiding sleeve type. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
shaft (3) is provided, at its end (11) and in proximity to the 

plate/shaft junction, with an excrescence (8) made of a magnetic 
material, notably of ferrite or a laminated material, the length 

of this shaft (3) being, in addition, sufficiently large for its 
flexion to be exploited when it is subjected to radial loadings. 
Device according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterized 
in that a mass (9), notably non-magnetic mass, is fixed by known 

means on the shaft (3) in order to counteract, on the one hand, 
the imbalance that is created when the shaft (3) is set in 

rotation and, on the other hand, the parasitic vibrations.  
 
Device according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterized 
in that the shaft (3) has at least one longitudinal zone (10) of 

reduced section for favouring deformation, extending between its 
end (11) connected to the vibrating plate (4) and its end (12) 

integrally connected to the drive element (2). 
Device according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterized 
in that it is arranged that the motor (2) is not placed directly 

in the axis of the shaft (3), but is connected to the shaft by means 
of a plurality of transmission elements (13), connected to one 

another and transmitting the rotational movement coming from the 
motor. 
Device according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterized 
in that the motor (2) may drive several shafts (3) integrally connected 

to a single plate or a plurality of plates (4). 
Device according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterized 
in that a clutch device (15) is interposed between the shaft (3) 

and the motor (2), in such a way that the motor can revolve continuously 
independently of the welding cycles, thus assuring the 

long life of the motor element (2). 
Device according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterized 
in that the excrescence (8) forming the movable magnetic core is 

assimilated to a sector of variable dimensions, allowing, at a 
given instant, the magnetic field of one or more electromagnets 

(7) to be encompassed simultaneously. 
Device according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterized 
in that the excrescence (8) forming the movable magnetic core is 

an electromagnet supplied through a connection permitting rotation, 
notably of the brush type or with a revolving collector, and 

creating a combination of attraction and repulsion forces depending 
upon the polarity of the magnetic masses in coincidence.  

 
Device according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterized 
in that the shaft (3) is composed of two distinct parts, the one 

of which is integrally connected to the plate (4) and the other 
integrally connected to the shaft of the motor (2), these parts 

being connected to one another by an elastic coupling, notably a 
combination of cardan joint and spring. 
Device according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterized 
in that a plurality of electromagnets (7) supplied with direct 

current is disposed on the bed-plate (1) of the machine and opposite 
the zone covered by the magnetic excrescence (8), when the 

latter describes one complete revolution.
