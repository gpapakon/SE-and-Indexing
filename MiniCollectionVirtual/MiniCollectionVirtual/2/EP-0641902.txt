<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a section 
member assembly for making continuous facades 

of civil buildings and the like, characterized 
in that said assembly comprises upright 

section members (1) and cross section members (10), having 
a box-like body (2,11) including, on its outwardly 

directed face, a lug (3,12), with a seat (5,13) for engaging 
therein at least a spacer section member (20), of a 

rigid polyamide, which is held in position by a 
pressing element (30), affixed by a bolt (32), passing 

through the spacer section member (20) and adapted to 
be engaged in the mentioned seat (5,13). 
Moreover there is provided a finishing 
section member (40) which can be connected to the 

pressing element (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a section
member assembly, for making continuous facades
of civil buildings and the like.As is known, a problem which is encountered
in making the so-called continuous facades
in civil buildings and the like, is that
of properly fitting the section members, depending
on the different thicknesses of the glass
plates or panels, which are installed for covering
the facade.In fact, at present, it is necessary to use
differentiated approaches, depending on the different
types of elements, so that there are built
very complex constructions which have not the required
mechanical strength characteristics.Another problem is that, in the corner regions,
it is necessary to provide several different
types of section members which can be
specifically designed depending on the application
needs, without the possibility of having
section members adapted to be easily fitted to
different contingent requirements.The document EP-A-0 445 866 discloses
a section member assembly for making continuous facades in civil
buildings and the like comprising upright section members and cross
section members, having a box-like body including, on its outwardly directed face, a lug
with a seat for engaging therein at least a spacer section member and being held in position by a pressing element affixed by a bolt, passing throught the spacer section member and
adapted to be engaged in said seat, a finishing section member being moreover provided
which can be coupled to said pressing element.Accordingly, the aim of the present invention 
is to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks,
by providing a section member assembly,
for making continuous facades of civil buildings
and the like, which affords the possibility,
starting from a very reduced number of component
elements, to fit all of the different assembling
conditions, while always assuring a good continuity,
both from a construction standpoint and
from a mechanical strength standpoint.Within the scope of the above mentioned
aim, a main object of the present invention is
to provide such a section member assembly which
can be easily fitted to all of the assembling
conditions, without the need of using specifically
designed elements while providing a perfect
tightness at any regions of the formed facade.Another object of the present invention is
to provide such a section member assembly which
is very reliable and safe in operation, can be
easily obtained starting from easily available
elements and materials and which, furthermore,
is very competitive

A section member assembly, for making
continuous facades in civil buildings and the like,

comprising upright section members (1,100,101), first
cross section members (10), and at least a second

concave cross section member (120), said upright
section members (1,100,101) and said first cross

section members (10) having a box-like body with an
outwardly directed face and said second concave cross

section member (120) having a box-like body with two
outwardly directed faces being arranged in a concave

angular relationship, a lug (3,12) being present on
each outwardly directed face of all said section members (1,10,100,101,120),

said lug (3,12) having a seat (5,13) for engaging
therein at least one spacer section member (20), made

of a rigid poly-amide, and being held in position by a
pressing element (30,92,121), affixed by a bolt (32),

passing through the spacer section member (20) and
adapted to be engaged in said seat (5,13), a finishing

section member (40,150,122) being moreover provided
which can be coupled to said pressing element

(30,92,121),

the lugs of the pair of outwardly directed faces of
the second concave cross section member (120) being

mutually arranged according to a set angle and both 
connecting the same pressing element (121), the

pressing element (121) being provided at an
intermediate portion thereof with a bending line in

order to assume a set angle and the corresponding
finishing section member (122) being also provided

with a weakened middle line (123) for the bending
thereof.
