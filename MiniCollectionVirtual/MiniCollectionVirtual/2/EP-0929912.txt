<ABSTRACT>
According to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, non-uniform helical antennas are described for use in two or more frequency hyperbands. For example, non-uniform helical antennas can be designed according to the present invention for usage in portable terminals capable of operating both at 800 MHz and at 1900 MHz. Tuning to both resonance frequencies can be accomplished by varying parameters of the helical antennas including, for example, the pitch angle, coil diameter, length and number and spacing of the coil turns.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to radio communications systems
and, in particular, to antennas which can be incorporated into portable terminals
and which allow the portable terminals to communicate within different
frequency bands.The cellular telephone industry has made phenomenal strides in
commercial operations in the United States as well as the rest of the world.
Growth in major metropolitan areas has far exceeded expectations and is rapidly
outstripping system capacity. If this trend continues, the effects of this industry's
growth will soon reach even the smallest markets. Innovative solutions are
required to meet these increasing capacity needs as well as maintain high quality
service and avoid rising prices.Throughout the world, one important step in the advancement of radio
communication systems is the change from analog to digital transmission.
Equally significant is the choice of an effective digital transmission scheme for
implementing the next generation technology, e.g., time division multiple access
(TDMA) or code division multiple access (CDMA). Furthermore, it is widely
believed that the first generation of Personal Communication Networks (PCNs),
employing low cost, pocket-sized, cordless telephones that can be carried
comfortably and used to make or receive calls in the home, office, street, car,
etc., will be provided by, for example, cellular carriers using the next generation
digital cellular system infrastructure.To provide an acceptable level of equipment compatibility, standards have
been created in various regions of the world. For example, analog standards
such as AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone System), NMT (Nordic Mobile
Telephone) and ETACS and digital standards such as D-AMPS (e.g., as specified
in EIA/TIA-IS-54-B and IS-136) and GSM (Global System for Mobile
Communications adopted by ETSI) have been promulgated to standardize design 
criteria for radio communication systems. Once created, these standards tend to
be reused in the same or similar form, to specify additional systems. For
example, in addition to the original GSM system, there also exists the DCS1800
(specified by ETSI) and PCS1900 (specified by JTC in J-STD-007), both of
which are based on GSM.However, the most recent evolution in cellular communications services
involves the adoption of additional frequency bands for use in handling mobile
communications, e.g., for Personal Communication Services (PCS) services.
Taking the U.S. as an example, the Cellular hyperband is assigned two frequency
bands
