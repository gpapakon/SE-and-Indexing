<ABSTRACT>
A cassette tape player has a cassette chamber defined 
therein and adapted to be selectively opened and closed by a 

hingedly supported lid which is movable between open and closed 
positions. This cassette tape player includes a cassette 

holder movable between loading and operative positions about a 
holder hinge axis lying parallel to the lid hinge axis about 

which the lid pivots. The cassette holder includes a generally 
elongated holder base and holder arms connected at one end 

rigidly to respective opposite ends of the holder base so as to 
define a cassette receiving chamber. A cassette guide is 

movably secured to a portion of the lid opposite to the lid 
hinge axis for pivotal movement between retracted and protruding 

positions about a guide hinge axis parallel to the holder 
hinge axis and operable to guide a tape cassette into the 

cassette receiving chamber with opposite side portions of the 
tape cassette slidingly received by the holder arms when the 

lid is in the open position. The cassette guide includes guide 
arms which are spaced from each other a distance corresponding 

to a space between the holder arms and which, when the lid is 
in the open position and the cassette guide is biased to the 

protruding position, form respective guide slopes generally 
continued to the cassette receiving chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a magnetic
tape recording and/reproducing apparatus and, more particularly,
to a cassette tape player of a type, though not exclusively
limited thereto, which can accommodate either one of two
different tape cassettes.Cassette tape players are being manufactured compact
in size and this is particularly true of ergonomic appliances.
Cassette tape players of a type employing a cassette loading
mechanism comprising a generally U-shaped cassette holder have
long been well known in the art. Examples of the cassette
loading mechanism hitherto employed are disclosed in, for
example, the Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 5-62311,
published March 12, 1993, (corresponding to U.S. Patent Application
Ser.No. 07/936,592, filed August 27, 1992, and EP
Published Patent Application No. 530700-A2, published March 10,
1993) and U.S. Patent No. 5,172,284, issued December 15, 1992.However, with the advent of digitalization of
acoustic systems, a relatively recent product in the field of
cassette tape recording and/or reproducing apparatuses is a
high-fidelity digital audio tape player. The digital audio
tape player currently placed in the market is available in two
types, namely, R-DAT (rotary head digital audio tape) recorders
and S-DAT (stationary head digital audio tape) recorders,
according to the different system protocols. The R-DAT player makes use of a magnetic recording
and/or reproducing head supported for rotation relative to a
length of magnetic recording tape that is moved slantwise relative
to the plane of rotation of the magnetic recording and/or
reproducing head. In contrast thereto, the S-DAT player makes
use of a magnetic recording and/or reproducing head supported
stationary relative to a length of a magnetic recording tape
that is moved relative to the magnetic recording and/or reproducing
head. So far as a tape cassette is concerned, the both
have no compatibility due to difference in sound recording
format.However, due to the use of the stationary head, the
S-DAT player has a compatibility with the long-lasting, popular
analog audio tape player in the sense that the S-DAT player can
accommodate not only a digital compact cassette (DCC) designed
specifically for use with the S-DAT player, but also an analog
compact cassette (ACC) designed specifically for use with the
analog audio tape player. The digital compact cassette and the
analog compact cassette have many structural similarities with
slight difference in dimension as will subsequently be

A cassette tape player having a cassette chamber
defined therein and adapted to be selectively opened and closed

by a hingedly supported lid (21) which is movable between open and
closed positions, said cassette tape player comprising:


a cassette holder (10,11,12) movable between loading and operative
positions about a holder hinge axis (9) lying parallel to the lid

hinge axis (21a) about which the lid pivots, said cassette holder
including a generally elongated holder base (10) and holder arms (11,12)

connected at one end rigidly to respective opposite ends of the
holder base so as to define a cassette receiving chamber;

said cassette tape player being characterised in that it also comprises

a cassette guide (22) movably secured to a portion of the lid
opposite to the lid hinge axis (21a) for pivotal movement between

retracted and protruding positions about a guide hinge axis (26d)
parallel to the holder hinge axis (9) and operable to guide a tape

cassette (1 or 5) into the cassette receiving chamber with opposite side
portions of the tape cassette slidingly received by the holder

arms when the lid is in the open position; and
said cassette guide including guide arms which are spaced
from each other a distance corresponding to a space between the

holder arms (11,12) and which, when the lid is in the open position and
the cassette guide is biased to the protruding position, form

respective guide slopes extending substantially up to the cassette
receiving chamber.
The cassette tape player as claimed in Claim 1,
further comprising a biasing means (23a,11e,12e) applying a resilient force

to said cassette guide so as to urge the cassette guide
normally to the protruding position and also to the tape 

cassette to retain said tape cassette in position within the
cassette chamber, said cassette guide being forcibly moved to

the retracted position against the biasing means (23a) when the lid
is moved to the closed position, and wherein said guide arms
