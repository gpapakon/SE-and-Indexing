<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hybrid information recording
medium provided with a plurality of information storage
means.Hitherto, as information recording media, there have been
known a magnetic recording medium capable of recording
and/or reproducing information magnetically, an optical
recording medium capable of recording and/or reproducing
information with a light beam, and a information
recording medium capable of recording and/or reproducing
information electrically, for example an IC card which
is an information card provided with an integrated
circuit module.In recent years, however, a hybrid information recording
medium having a plurality of information storage means
has been proposed.Hybrid information cards having an optical recording
layer and an IC module are disclosed, for example, in
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Applications JP-A-61-103287 and
JP-A-4-49098. Such a hybrid information recording medium is disclosed
in JP-A-61-103287 on which appended claims 1 and 29 are based. A typical sectional view of such a
medium is shown in Figure 1.Referring to Figure 1, 101 is an information card, 102
is a card substrate, 103 is an optical recording medium,
and 104 is an IC module. However, there is no disclosure
in JP-A-61-103287 about any particular composition which
improves the hybrid information medium's characteristics,
or a method of producing such hybrid information
recording medium.In view of the above prior art, an object of the present
invention is to provide a high quality hybrid information
recording medium.Another object of the present invention is to provide a
process for producing a high quality hybrid information
recording medium at lower cost than has previously been
possible.According to an aspect of the present invention, there
is provided a hybrid information recording medium
provided with an IC module and an optical recording layer
as information storage means, wherein the substrate which
retains the IC module does not directly contact the optical 
recording layer directly.According to another aspect of the present invention,
there is provided a process for producing a hybrid
information recording medium provided with an IC module
and an optical recording layer as information storage
means, which comprises the steps of:
providing a first substrate for retaining the IC
module;providing a second substrate provided with the
optical recording layer;bonding the first substrate to the second substrate
without exposing the optical recording layer, and without
bringing into direct contact
