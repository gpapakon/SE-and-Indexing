<CLAIMS>
A heating appliance for cooking or frying food in a 
liquid, the appliance comprising a cooking vessel (1) 

surrounded by an outer skirt (3) forming the outside wall 
thereof, heating means (4, 5), and control means (15, 25) 

for controlling its operating cycle, with at least a 
portion of said control means (15, 25) being fixed on a 

support panel (11) designed to be removably mounted in a 
corresponding cutout (10) in the outer skirt (3) to 

constitute a portion of the outside wall of the 
appliance, the appliance being characterized in that the 

control means (15, 25) comprise temperature regulation 
components mounted on the support panel (11) in such a 

manner as to be in heat-exchange relationship with the 
vessel (1) when said support panel (11) is in position. 
An appliance according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the temperature regulation components are mounted to 

be resiliently movable on the support panel (11) in a 
direction that is substantially normal to the walls of 

the vessel (1) so as to come into contact with the vessel 
(1) when said support panel (11) is in position. 
An appliance according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the support panel (11) is secured via its inside 

face facing the vessel (1) to a backplate (13) in such a 
manner as to constitute a removable control housing. 
An appliance according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the support panel (11) or the 

housing is provided with retaining tongues (40), 
preferably secured to the backplate (13), designed to cooperate 

with openings (41, 41a) formed in the outer skirt 
(3) to provide removable mounting for the support panel 

(11) or the housing, and to enable it to be extracted.  
 
An appliance according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the temperature regulation 

components are constituted by a thermostat (15). 
An appliance according to claim 5, characterized in 
that the thermostat (15) includes a thermal contact piece 

(20) which piece is preferably made of aluminium. 
An appliance according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the temperature regulation elements 

further include a fuse (25) which is preferably mounted 
in resiliently movable manner on the backplate (13) to 

move in a direction that is substantially normal to the 
wall of the vessel (1), thereby enabling it to come into 

thermal contact with the vessel (1) when the support 
panel (11) is in position. 
An appliance according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the control means fixed on the 

support panel (11) include members for controlling, 
adjusting, and monitoring the operating cycle thereof, 

said members being integrated and actuatable by the user 
from the outside face of said support panel. 
An appliance according to claim 8, characterized in 
that the control members comprise a knob (30) for 

controlling the position of the basket (33) inserted in 
the vessel (1). 
An appliance according to claim 9, characterized in 
that the control knob (30) is provided with a system for 

compensating alignment between the rotary drive axis (51) 
of the knob (30) and the shaft (31) for controlling 

raising and lowering of the basket (33). 
An appliance according to claim 10, characterized in 
that the alignment compensation system includes an  

 
adjustment disk (53) mounted to move over a restricted 

stroke relative to the control knob (30) along a first 

adjustment axis (54) normal to the rotary drive axis (51) 
of said knob, and a coupling sleeve (60) between the knob 

(30) and the control shaft (31) for the basket (33), said 
sleeve (60) being movably mounted relative to the 

adjustment disk (53) to move over a restricted stroke 
along a second adjustment axis (70) normal to the first 

adjustment axis (54). 
An appliance according to claim 11, characterized in 
that the adjustment disk (53) includes a first pair of 

diametrically opposite slot-shaped openings (55a, 55b) 
for mounting the disk (53) movably on two pins (56) on 

the control knob (30), and a second pair of diametrically 
opposite slot-shaped openings (55c, 55d) on the second 

adjustment axis (70) in which two lugs (63) secured to 
the coupling (60) are movably received. 
An appliance according to any one of claims 8 to 12, 
characterized in that the adjustment members comprise a 

knob (22) for adjusting the thermostat (15) and 
monitoring members including an on/off indicator light 

(36) and preferably a timer and an on/off switch. 
An appliance according to any one of claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in that it is constituted by a deep fryer.
