<ABSTRACT>
A removable fastener (10) for a part 
such as a furniture accessory with a hole in a surface 

comprises a dowel anchor (11) with 
means (23) of lateral engagement in the surface hole. 

The dowel anchor comprises a seat (13) in which is 
received the end of an element (12) in turn 

constrained to the part and there being between the 
element and the seat means of separable mutual constraint. 

The element is provided in the form of a dowel or pin (12) 
constrained to the part to be axially insertable 

in the seat (13) in the dowel anchor and the 
constraint means comprise elastically yielding elements 

(14, 15) projecting toward the axis of the 
seat (13) to engage the side wall of the dowel (12) 

upon its insertion in the seat.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fasteners for snap
fastening and in particular for fastening furniture
hardware elements such as hinges, drawer slides, etc.There are known fasteners comprising dowel anchors to be
engaged in holes in furniture panels while in said dowel
anchors there being subsequently engageable fastening
screws for hinges, slides, etc.In the furniture industry there is an ever growing
requirement to reduce assembly time for the various
components of the furnishings whether during assembly at
the works or during final installation at the user's site.From this viewpoint screw assembly is quite
unsatisfactory. There have also been proposed faster
systems, e.g. with pressure assembly, but which are not
easy to disassemble, and dovetail systems requiring
dedicated tools for assembly and disassembly or requiring
special handling to achieve engagement, which requires a
certain skill from the assembler and does not permit great
speed of assembly. In addition, dovetail systems are often
relatively costly because of the structural complications
they involve. FR-2.506.865 discloses a fastener in which the dowel is
insertable with an axial movement in a seat, the dowel
being jammed by means of a latching tongue projecting in
the seat. In order to be dissassembled, the dowel has to
rotate until a passage in the dowel falls in line with the
tongue. In this manner, the dowel can be pulled out. The
dowel rotation does not cause an axial movement.DE-8717482 discloses a fastener in which a dowel is
insertable in a seat, once the dowel projections are
aligned with passages in the seat. The dowel lock in the
seat is obtained on dowel rotation so as to remove the
projections from the alignment with the passages. The
dowel unlocking is obtained by making the dowel rotate so
as to bring the projections again aligned with the
passages.The general purpose of the present invention is to supply
economical fasteners permitting fast assembly and allowing
at the same time easy disassembly without the need of
special tools or skills on the part of the installer.In view of said purpose it is sought to provide in 
accordance with the present invention a removable fastener
as claimed in claim 1.To clarify the explanation of the innovative principles of
the present invention and its advantages compared with the
known art there is described below with the aid of the
annexed drawings possible embodiment thereof by way of
nonlimiting examples applying said principles. In the

Removable fastener (110) for a part (122)
such as a furniture accessory with a hole in a surface

comprising a dowel anchor (111) with means
(112) of lateral engagement in the surface hole and the

dowel anchor comprising a seat (113) in which is
received the end of an element (114) in turn

constrained to the part and between the element and the
seat there being separable mutual constraint means and

the element being provided in the form
of a dowel (114) constrained to the part to

be axially insertable in the seat (113) in the dowel
anchor and the constraint means comprising elastic

yielding elements (117) projecting in the
seat (112)

so that the free ends thereof rest on the lateral sides of the dowel, said free ends
and lateral sides having surfaces for engaging one against

the other so as to allow the sliding axial movement of the
dowel in a direction towards the inside of the seat and to

hinder the movement in the opposite direction,
characterized in that said surfaces are so shaped and directed as to

engage one against the other along a helical path length
around the dowel axis, thereby generating a dowel axial

movement onto dowel rotation. 
Fastener in accordance with claim 1 characterised in
that the yielding elements comprise elastic tabs

(117) having free ends projecting from the side walls of 
the seat toward the axis of the seat (113) inclined in

a direction opposite the dowel insertion direction in the
seat to engage the lateral wall of the dowel

(114) upon its insertion in the seat.
Fastener in accordance with claim 1 characterised in
that the lateral engagement means of the dowel anchor 

comprise ribbings (112) projecting radially therefrom.
Fastener in accordance with claim 3 characterised in
that the ribbings (112) are circumferential ribbings

tapered in the direction of insertion of the dowel in the
hole.
Fastener in accordance with claim 1 characterised in
that the dowel anchor is pressed from elastically yielding

material.
Fastener in accordance with claim 1 characterised in
that the dowel has an end opposite the end of insertion in

the seat having a widened head bearing handling means for
rotation of the dowel. 
Fastener in accordance with claim 2 characterised in
that the elastically yielding tabs are provided in a

single piece by a washer (117) received in the dowel
anchor axially to the seat (113).
Fastener in accordance with claim 7 characterised in
that the washer (116) is near the axial end of the dowel

anchor opposite that of introduction of the dowel.
Fastener in accordance with claim 2 characterised in
that the dowel comprises on its teeth engagement side

surface at least one cut with helical progression (121) to
allow withdrawal of the dowel from the seat by axial

rotation.
Fastener in accordance with claim 2 characterised in
that the teeth have ends for engagement with the dowel

inclined helically in relation to the dowel axis to allow 
withdrawal of the dowel from the seat by axial rotation.
Fastener in accordance with claim 7 characterised in
that the washer is received in the dowel anchor opposite a

seat (115) having its bottom toward the end of the dowel
anchor for introduction of the dowel which is tapered to

constitute a support surface to prevent overturning of the
teeth.
Fastener in accordance with claim 7 characterised in
that the washer (116) has elements (118) for lateral

engagement in the dowel anchor to avoid reciprocal axial
rotation of the dowel anchor and washer.
Fastener in accordance with claim 9 characterised in
that the cuts are in a number equal to the number of teeth

in order to achieve a number of threads equal to the
number of teeth.
