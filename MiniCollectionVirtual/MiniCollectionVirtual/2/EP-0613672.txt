<ABSTRACT>
A dissolvable tubular tampon applicator made 
from a water-soluble polymer or substrate having a 

surface (13,14) coated with a degradable, water-insoluble 
polymeric material (15) and methods for making the same. The 

water-insoluble polymeric material can be wax, 
hydrogenated vegetable oil, or food grade shellac. The 

water-soluble polymer can be thermoplastic starch, 
polyvinyl alcohol, poly(alkylene oxide), hydroxyethyl 

cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyvinyl 
pyrrolidone, polyacrylamide, polyacrylic acid or 

polyvinyl methyl ether-co maleic anhydride. The method 
to make the article can involve tumble-coating the 

exterior surface of the water-soluble polymeric tubular 
applicator with the heat-softened water-insoluble 

polymeric material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a water-soluble 
disposable article such as a catamenial tampon applicator 
and methods for producing the same. More particularly, 
this invention relates to an applicator comprising at 
least one elongated tubular member comprised of a water-soluble 
polymer coated on the exterior surface thereof 
with one or more water-insoluble polymeric material(s) 
and, methods for producing the same. The standard construction for a tampon 
applicator is a pair of telescoping tubes, the outer tube 
carrying the tampon formed of a compressed absorbent 
material (sometimes referred to as a "pledget", 
particularly if formed of a uncompressed super-absorbent 
material) and the inner tube serving as a plunger for 
ejecting the tampon. Tampon applicators in current 
commercial use are typically made from either an 
insoluble plastic or a flushable smooth surfaced 
cardboard. Plastic tampon applicators are preferred by a 
certain number of women since they are perceived to be 
smoother and include petal-shaped lobes covering the 
forward end of the tampon which aids in the insertion of 
the device and in retaining and protecting the tampon 
while it is in the outer tube. Plastic tampon 
applicators are typically made from water insoluble 
polyethylene using an injection-molding process. These 
plastic applicators have always posed a significant 
environmental and aesthetic problem, in spite of their 
commercial success. They should never be disposed of by 
flushing, yet once soiled, women reluctantly are 
otherwise forced to dispose of them with the dry trash. For this reason flushable cardboard applicators 
have retained their popularity while those in this art 
have continued to search for over half a century for an 
applicator that would combine the benefits of both types  
 
of applicators. All of the currently used commercial 
plastic applicators remain ill-suited for toilet 
disposal. While such solid insoluble applicators can be 
forced to flush, they settle in septic tanks without 
decomposing. Moreover, as is also already well 
recognized in the prior art, they accumulate on the 
screens in waste-water treatment plants, creating 
blockages. If the screens do not stop them, they escape 
into environment intact, often washing up on beaches. 
Because plastic tampon applicators typically neither 
float on the surface nor settle to the bottom of setting 
tanks, they are not removed as sludge or by skimmers. In 
view of such environmental and aesthetic considerations, 
it is thus highly

<CLAIMS>
A tampon applicator comprising at least 
one elongated tubular member having an exterior surface; 

and a coating on the exterior surface; said tubular 
member comprising a water-soluble polymer; and said 

coating comprising a water-insoluble polymeric material 
selected from the group consisting of wax, hydrogenated 

vegetable oil, and food grade shellac. 
The tampon applicator of claim 1 wherein 
the water-soluble polymer is selected from the group 

consisting of thermoplastic starch, polyvinyl alcohol, 
poly(alkylene oxide), hydroxyethyl cellulose, 

hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, 
polyacrylamide, polyacrylic acid, and polyvinyl methyl 

ether-co maleic anhydride.

the wax is selected from the group consisting of natural 

wax and synthetic wax. 
The tampon applicator of claim 4 wherein 
the wax is a natural wax selected from the group 

consisting of animal wax, vegetable wax and mineral wax.
