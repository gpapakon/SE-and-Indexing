<ABSTRACT>
A multipurpose plastic strip which not only has the function of a corner guard rail, but, moreover, also has the function of a settlement-joint strip and can be used for further application purposes, is characterised by a profile which is configured in the manner of a # (2' + 3' + 4'), in the case of which the projecting central leg serves as a termination leg (2'), and, as required, one of the two extended fastening legs (3', 4') can be easily removed.

A multipurpose plastics strip having a basic L shape 
of relatively rigid material, the arms of the L serving 

as a fixing arm and a closure arm, the closure arm being 
sheathed at least to some extent in a resilient 

relatively soft plastics material,
 
characterised in that the section has a ⊥ configuration 

(2 + 3 + 4; 2' + 3' + 4') in which the central arm serves 
as closure arm (2; 2') and one of the two outwardly 

extending fixing arms (3, 4; 3', 4') is readily removable 
at choice. 
A multipurpose strip according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the filling thickening (5) of the 

closure arm (2) has a U-shape. 
A multipurpose strip according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the filling thickening (5') of the 

closure arm (2') has a □-shape. 
A multipurpose strip according to any one of claims 
1 to 3, characterised in that the filling thickening (5; 

5') is in the form of a U or □ hollow section or □ solid 
section. 
A multipurpose strip according to claims 1 and 3, 
characterised in that an inner web element (15') is so 

disposed inside the ∟-shaped filling thickening (5') of 
the closure arm (2') that the filling thickening (5') 

extends around it. 
A multipurpose strip according to any of the 
preceding claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the 

filling thickening (5; 5') converges near the transition 
from the closure arm to the fixing arm (3, 4; 3', 4') by 

approximately 5/100 to 5/10 mm, preferably 2/10 mm.  
 
A multipurpose strip according to claim 1, 
characterised in that at least one of the transition 

zones between the closure arm (2) and the fixing arm (3, 
4) has a frangible zone (8). 
A multipurpose strip according to claim 1, 
characterised in that at least one of the transition 

zones between the closure arm (2') and the fixing arm 
(3', 4') has a frangible zone (8'). 
A multipurpose strip according to any of the 
previous claims 1 to 8, characterised in that one fixing 

arm (3, 4) runs out in a straight edge (12) and the other 
arm runs out in a meander-like edge (11). 
A multipurpose strip according to any of the 
preceding claims 1 to 8, characterised in that 


both the fixing arms (3', 4') run out in a meander-like 
edge (11, 11"), and 
the meander-like edge (11') of the first fixing 
arm (3') and the meander-like edge (11") of the 

second fixing arm (4') are so offset from one another 
that oscillation-like troughs (13') in the first 

fixing arm (3') are opposite oscillation-like crests 
(19') of the second fixing arm (4') and oscillation-like 

crests (18') of the first fixing arm (3') are 
opposite oscillation-like troughs (14') in the second 

fixing arm (4'). 
A multipurpose strip according to one or more of the 
preceding claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the 

thickness of the fixing arms (3', 4') narrows from the 
start (3''', 4'''), of the inner fixing arm towards the 

outer end (3", 4") of the fixing arm. 
A multipurpose strip according to any of the 
preceding claims 1 to 11, characterised in that the inner 

start (3''', 4''') of the fixing arm merges into a bent  
 

sub-arm (20', 21') and the sub-arms (20', 21') of both 
fixing arms (3', 4') are connected to a narrow side (zone 

7') of the closure arm (2'). 
A multipurpose strip according to claim 12, 
characterised in that the sub-arms (20, 21') are spaced 

apart from one another by a gap (24'). 
A multipurpose strip according to any of the 
preceding claims 1 to 13, characterised in that the 

fixing arms (3, 4; 3', 4') are formed with perforations 
(9, 10; 9', 10'). 
A multipurpose strip according to any of the 
preceding claims 1 to 14, characterised in that the 

filling thickening (5; 5') has on its outside adhesion-promoting 
structures, more particularly fluting (6; 6') 

extending axially of the strip. 
A multipurpose strip according to any of the 
preceding claims 1 to 15, characterised in that the 

fixing arms (3', 4') have at least on their underside 
adhesion-promoting structures, more particularly raised 

linear parts (22', 23') extending axially of the strip. 
A multipurpose strip according to any of the 
preceding claims 1 to 16, characterised in that the 

fixing arms (3, 4, 3', 4') terminate in at least one 
straight end (25, 26'). 
A multipurpose strip according to any of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the strip (1; 1') 

is coextruded as a whole from a soft and a hard 
thermoplastics.
