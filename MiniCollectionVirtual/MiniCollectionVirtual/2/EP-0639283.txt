<ABSTRACT>
The wristwatch of the invention has a bracelet (8) and a case consisting of three components (upper part or cover glass 5, central part or dial, lower part or base 3) in which is fitted a movement with time indicators, especially hands, and has standardized connecting regions (9) in which the bracelet (8) and at least two of the case parts are secured or securable together. The connecting regions (9) take the form, for instance, of hinges and, during assembly, serve as positioning auxiliaries for aligning the individual parts and as a gripping and orientation point for alignment and assembly tools and as final or temporary connections between the case parts and the bracelet. Watch models of different shapes having the same, standardised connecting regions can be assembled by substantially the same procedure and assembly tools, thus permitting faster model changes.

Wristwatch having a casing in which a watch
movement (W) with time indicators, in particular hands

(Z), is arranged, it being the case that the casing, in
three parts, comprises a first outer part (U) and a

second outer part (O) and the central part (M), and the
watch movement (W) is arranged between the first outer

part (U) and the central part (M) and the time indicators
(Z) are arranged between the central part (M) and the

second outer part (O), and having a wrist strap (B) which
has connecting parts (B.1, B.2, ...) which, along with

other connecting parts (U.1, U.2 ..., O.1, O.2, ...) on
casing parts (U, M, O), form a pinned articulation,

characterized in that at least two of the casing parts,
the central part (M) and one of the two outer parts (U,

O) or the two outer parts (U, O), can be interlinked with
said connecting parts (B.1, B.2, ...) on the wrist strap

(B) such that, together, they form said pinned
articulation in the form of a pinned articulation of at

least three connecting parts (U.1, U.2 ..., M.1, M.2,
..., O.1, O.2, ..., B.1, B.2, ...) arranged around a

common region of rotation.
Wristwatch according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the two outer parts (U, O) and the central part (M)

of the casing as well as the wrist strap (B) have connecting
parts (U.1, U.2, ... M.1, M.2 ..., O.1, O.2,

..., B.1, B.2, ...) which can be assembled to form a
pinned articulation and, together, form a pinned articulation

of at least four connecting parts which are
arranged around a common region of rotation. 
Wristwatch according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the pinned articulation is formed by at

least one integrally formed element (U.1, U.2, O.1, O.2,
O.3) which has bores and is located on at least two

casing parts (U, M, O) in each case, by at least one loop
(B.1, B.2) on the wrist strap (B), and by a pin (S) which

runs through the bores of the integrally formed elements
and the loops.
Wristwatch according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the pinned articulation is formed by at

least one integrally formed element (B.3) on the strap
(B), the integrally formed strap element (B.3) being

arranged in opening-forming integrally formed elements
(U.4, O.4, O.5) of at least two casing parts (U, O, M).
Wristwatch according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the pinned articulation is formed by at

least one integrally formed element (U.6, O.6) in each
case on at least two casing parts (U, O, M), the

integrally formed casing-part elements (U.6, O.6) being
arranged in pairs in opening-forming integrally formed

elements (B.4) on the strap (B).
Wristwatch according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that at least one further, direct

connection (211, 212) is provided between two casing
parts (201, 202, 203).
Wristwatch according to Claim 6, characterized in
that, by means of one further direct connection (108, 110

and 112, 113) in each case, the central casing part or
the face (104) is fastened directly on the bottom casing

part or the shell (102) and the top casing part or the
cover glass (105) is fastened directly on the central

casing part or the face (104).
Wristwatch according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized
in that the direct connection (211, 212) provided is

a weld connection.
Wristwatch according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that at least one further part (44, 50)

of the watch is included in the connecting region.
Wristwatch according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the further part included in the connecting region is a protective or decorative element (44, 50).
Wristwatch according to one of Claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the central casing part or the face (203) is configured three-dimensionally such that it has a volume, in that a lead-through (204) for a winding stem (205) is provided in said volume, and in that the lead-through of the winding stem (205) through the face (203) is sealed by means of a seal (206).
Wristwatch according to Claim 11, characterized in that the face (203) projects beyond the cover glass (202) on all sides.
Wristwatch according to Claim 11 or 12, characterized in that the lead-through (204) of the winding stem (205) additionally leads through the bottom casing part or the shell (201).
Wristwatch according to Claim 13, characterized in that the lead-through (204) of the winding stem (205) additionally leads through the top casing part or the cover glass (202).
Wristwatch according to Claim 14, characterized in that the three-dimensional face (203) is of non-uniform thickness.
Cover glass for a wristwatch according to one of Claims 1 to 15, characterized in that it has at least two integrally formed elements (11, 38) for connection to the wrist strap (8).
