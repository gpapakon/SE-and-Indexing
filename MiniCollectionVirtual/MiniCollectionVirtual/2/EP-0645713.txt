<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to realize a 
flash memory in which word redundancy can be implemented. 

In a nonvolatile semiconductor memory in which word 
redundancy is implemented to replace a faulty memory 

cell with a redundancy nonvolatile memory cell in units 
of a word line, source lines are a plurality of lines 

SL1, SL2, SL3, etc., arranged in a one-to-one 
correspondence with and in parallel with word lines WL1, 

WL2, etc. The source lines are connected to a first 
common source line CSL1 via first switching means TrA1, 

TrA2, etc. that are selectively allowed to conduct 
owing to voltage applied to word lines for reading or 

writing. The source lines are connected to a second 
common source line SCL2 via second switching means TrB1, 

TrB2, etc. that conduct for erasing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nonvolatile
semiconductor memory that can be completely or partially
electrically erased at one time or one or more lines and which
is referred to as a flash memory. More particularly, this
invention is concerned with a word line redundancy flash
memory in which faulty memory cells are replaced with
redundant memory cells in units of a word line.In recent years, in the field of nonvolatile
memories, efforts have been made to develop an element
having a cell structure that enables electrical
rewriting of data, permits low cost per bit, realizes
downsizing, and offers a large storage capacity. This
aims at replacement of magnetic memory media with
semiconductor memories. A cell structure for realizing
a large storage capacity and low cost is a one-transistor-per-one-cell
structure in which, similarly
to the cell structure of an EPROM, each cell has a
single floating gate.Even in flash memory, redundancy, that is a
technology for replacing faulty memory cells with spare
redundant memory cells, is implemented in an effort to
improve production yield.When redundancy is implemented in a DRAM or SRAM,
all memory cells on a row or column to which a faulty
memory cell belongs are replaced. Specifically,
assuming that the direction of a word line is regarded
as a row and the direction of a bit line is regarded as
a column, when row (word line) redundancy is attempted,
one or more redundant word lines and memory cells to be
connected on the rows of the word lines are prepared,
and then a word line on which a faulty memory cell is
connected is replaced with the redundant word line. 
Replacement can be repeated for the number of redundant
word lines prepared. When column redundancy is attempted,
similarly to the row redundancy, one or more redundant
bit lines and memory cells to be connected on the
columns of the bit lines are prepared, and then a bit
line on which a faulty memory cell is connected is
replaced with a redundant bit line.In a conventional flash memory, row redundancy is
difficult to realize because of an excessively erased
cell. When excessive electrons are drawn out of a
floating gate of a memory cell during erasure, the
floating gate becomes positive. Even if the memory cell
is unselected, leakage current flows through the bit
line on which the memory cell is connected. As a result,
reading cannot be achieved correctly. This memory cell
is referred to as an excessive-erasure cell.In a flash memory, as described above, erasing is
achieved by applying high voltage to
