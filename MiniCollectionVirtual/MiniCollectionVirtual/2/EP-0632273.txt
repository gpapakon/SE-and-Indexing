An apparatus senses a free stream flow parameter using airflow 
adjacent an air vehicle. The apparatus includes a first sensor sensing a 

longitudinal axial component and a lateral axial component of a parameter of 
local airflow immediately adjacent the first sensor. A second sensor senses a 

longitudinal axial component and a second axial component perpendicular to the 
lateral axial component sensed by the first sensor of a parameter of local airflow 

immediately adjacent the second sensor. The first and second sensors are 
mounted on the air vehicle such that a longitudinal axis of the first sensor lies 

in a first plane including a longitudinal axis and a longitudinal axis of the second 
sensor means lies in a second plane substantially perpendicular to the first plane 

and including the longitudinal axis of the first plane. A correction unit obtains 
a signal representing the free stream flow parameter as a function of the 

parameter components sensed by the first and second sensors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to air data sensing systems,
and, in particular, to air data sensing systems which sense air data parameters on
highly maneuverable air vehicles.A variety of air data sensors exist which sense various air data
parameters such as airflow velocity and direction, air vehicle angle-of-attack and
angle-of-sideslip, and static pressure. For example, orthogonal air speed sensors
which are capable of measuring local flow velocities through 360° of flow
direction, which occurs when the sensors are mounted on the nose of a
helicopter, are described in U.S. Patents 3,646,811 and 4,522,070. High performance fighter aircraft operate through a range of attack
and sideslip which can be measured by a more conventional L-shaped multiple
output pitot-static-flow angle air data sensors.Typically, air data sensors are positioned on the surface of the
fuselage of an air vehicle. The air data sensors measure local airflow conditions
dependent on the mounting location and the shape of the air vehicle. Local flow
parameters such as local flow velocity magnitude and direction typically vary
significantly from the free stream flow conditions. Thus, an air data sensing
system is desired that obtains complete air data parameters indicative of the free
stream flow conditions.The present invention relates to an apparatus on board an air
vehicle for sensing a free stream flow parameter when mounted adjacent the air
vehicle. A first sensor senses a longitudinal component and a lateral axial
component of a parameter of local airflow immediately adjacent the first sensor
and provides output signals as a function of the local longitudinal and lateral 
components. The first sensor is mounted on the air vehicle such that a
longitudinal axis of the first sensor lies in a first reference plane including a
reference longitudinal axis. A second sensor also senses a longitudinal
component of the airflow parameter and also a second axial component of the
airflow parameter in direction perpendicular to the lateral axial component sensed
by the first sensor. The sensors provide output signals as a function of the local
longitudinal and axial components of the airflow parameter being measured. The
second sensor is mounted on the air vehicle such that a longitudinal axis of the
second sensor means lies in a second plane substantially perpendicular to the first
plane and including the reference longitudinal axis of the first plane which is at
aknown relation to a longitudinal reference axis of the air vehicle.
