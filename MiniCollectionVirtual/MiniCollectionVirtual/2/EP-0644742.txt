<ABSTRACT>
A cylindrical diffuser tip (10) for use with an optical fiber is described. The diffuser tip comprises a silicone core (14) abutted to the terminus (13) of the conventional optically transmissive core (11) of an optical fiber, and an outer protective plastic tube (17) to provide controlled stiffness or rigidity to the silicone diffuser tip (10) while maintaining a flexibility comparable to that of the optical fiber. The scattering centers (16) embedded in the silicone core, are distributed to yield a particular light distribution pattern. For example, the scattering centers (16) may be distributed to provide a gradient that increases continuously in a direction perpendicular from the terminus face (13) of the optical fiber. The tip provides a substantially uniform distribution of radiance along its length and is particularly useful for laser radiation treatment of tumors. The stiffness of the diffuser tip can be varied by choosing a protective tube (17) of varying wall thickness and durometer. Since the cladding (12) surrounding the fiber core (11) remains intact, the strength of the diffuser tip is improved rendering the tip useful for providing uniform cylindrical illumination of a target tissue in remote areas of the body.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a means for cylindrically diffusing energy from an optical
wave guide, and more particularly to a cylindrical diffuser tip for an optical fiber or fiber
bundle, according to the preamble of claim 1. The diffuser tip generally is useful for performing
Photodynamic Therapy in the treatment of diseased tissue such as tumors, inducing
hyperthermia or performing both percutaneous and intraoperative phototherapy of cardiovascular
disease.The description of the prior art is conveniently introduced by a brief description of Photodynamic
Therapy (PDT), the therapeutic modality giving rise to the current invention.Photodynamic treatment of tumors requires irradiation of the tumor under treatment with light
of a wavelength that penetrates tissue, usually around 630-800 nanometer range, generally by
means of a laser. A short time prior to irradiation, the patient is injected with an appropriate
photo-sensitive compound which selectively localizes in a target tissue such as a hematoporphyrin
derivative which accumulates in the vascular stoma of the tumor and in the 
tumor cells. Subcutaneous tumors greater than 1.0 cm thick,
also referred to herein as interstitial tumors, undergoing
this treatment require the use of optical fibers to guide
the light from the source to the deeper treatment area. In
many cases, the outlet termination of the fiber is inserted
directly into the tumor. In other cases, where the tumor is
located in passages, for example endobronchial tumors, the
optical fiber termination is positioned intraluminally in
juxtaposition to the tumor. Similarly, photo irradiation of
pre-sensitized atheromatous plaque on the wall of a blood
vessel , a procedure known as photoatherolytic therapy, has
been shown to be an effective method for removing such
plaque. Accordingly suitable fiber terminations for the
delivery of a uniform, predictable dosage of light
irradiation to a large volume of tumor tissue or the wall of
a tubular tissue are needed.Considerable light radiation must be transmitted to
kill large tumor masses by photo irradiation and the
required radiation can cause undesired overheating,
especially if it is concentrated in too small a region.
This causes problems in delivering radiant energy out of the
end of a normal blunt ended or flat cut optical fiber,
making a small hot spot which may lead to excessive heating,
carbonization and necrosis of the adjacent tissue rendering
such tissue opaque to transillumination. Thermal sources 
such as xenon arc lamps also
