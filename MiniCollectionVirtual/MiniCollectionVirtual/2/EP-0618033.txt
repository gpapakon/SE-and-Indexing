<ABSTRACT>

suitable to shear 

rolled stock (11) travelling at 120 metres per second and 
more, the shears comprising an upstream one-channel switch 

(16), the upstream switch (16) causing the rolled stock (11) 
to be fed into the shearing area (35), the circumferential 

position of the blades (13) being associated with the 
lateral position of the upstream one-channel switch (16) at 

least in the transient time of the feed of the rolled stock 
(11) through the shearing area (35), means for the 

differentiated receiving and directing of a leading end 
segment (11a), trailing end segment (11b) and main body 

(111) respectively of the rolled stock (11) being included 
downstream and possibly being connected downstream to a 

scrap assembly (25) and to a system for forming and 
collecting coils, the means for the differentiated receiving 

consisting of a two-channel (22-23) switch (20) which can be 
oriented laterally substantially on the same orientation 

plane as, and in synchronisation with, the one-channel 
switch (16), the two-channel switch (20) including the 

inlets of two enlarged channels (22-23) superimposed on each 
other on a plane perpendicular to the axis (12) of rotation 

of the blade-holder drums (30), a central partition plate 
(19) to separate the two channels (22-23) being positioned 

on the plane of arrival and orientation of the rolled stock 
(11), the blades (13) being two on each drum (30) 

so as to form a specific pair of 
blades (13a) to shear the leading end (11a) of the rolled 

stock (11) and to create in the rolled stock (11) a first 
terminal arcuate portion, and a specific pair of blades 

(13b) to shear the trailing end (11b) of the rolled stock 
(11) and create in the trailing segment of the rolled stock 

a second contrary leading arcuate portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a high speed flying shears, as set
forth in the preamble of claim 1 and as known for example
from IT-A-1214194.The flying shears according to the invention acts on the
rolled stock, whether the latter be a round rod, wire rod,
bar, etc., leaving the last rolling train.The flying shears according to the invention is suitable
to shear rolled stock travelling at up to 100-120 metres per
second or more.It is a known fact of the state of the art that the
leading and trailing ends of the rolled stock leaving the
last rolling train include along their length geometric
deformations or inclusions which are not acceptable and
therefore have to be eliminated. This is normally carried
out at speed so as to obviate the times otherwise required
for shearing by hand downstream.In view of the very high speed of withdrawal of the rolled
stock from the rolling trains the problem of arranging in
line a flying shears providing sufficient assurance of
precision, reliability and accuracy of shearing becomes ever
more important.Various disclosures of flying shears for use with rolled
stock travelling at a high speed are known and employed in
the state of the art.Substantially efficient solutions are disclosed in FR-666.433,
DE-804.056, GB-2,075,899 and FR-1.578.587 but have
been found unsatisfactory for rolled stock travelling at
very high speeds. In particular, these solutions cannot
meet the shearing accuracy required.IT-A-1.214.194 in the name of the present applicants
discloses a very high speed flying shears which includes
contrarotating blades and cooperates with a switch of a 
start-stop type. This switch is suitable to convey the
rolled stock longitudinally and to move sideways so as to
feed the rolled stock into the shearing area.The circumferential positions of the contrarotating blades
can be linked to the lateral position of the switch with a
view to determining exactly the moment when the rolled stock
will lie between the blades, this moment coinciding with the
best position of those blades for the shearing operation.This solution is satisfactory in itself but entails the
drawback that the rolled stock leaving the shearing step is
not correctly guided towards the stations downstream, and
this situation involves vibrations and inaccuracies in
directing the stock towards the respective channels.
Moreover, the solution does not provide a natural deviation
for the intake of the material downstream of the shears,
whether the material be the main body of the rolled stock
directed towards the

High speed flying shears with contrarotating blades (13)
fitted to blade-holder drums (30) and suitable to shear

rolled stock (11) travelling at 120 metres per second and
more, the shears comprising an upstream one-channel switch

(16) of a start-stop type which conveys the rolled stock
(11) lengthwise and can be oriented laterally on a plane

substantially containing the axis of feed of the rolled
stock (11) and parallel to and lying between the planes

containing shafts (12) of rotation of the blade-holder drums

rolled stock (11) through the shearing area (35), conveying means for
the differentiated receiving and directing of a leading end

segment (11a), trailing end segment (11b) and main body
