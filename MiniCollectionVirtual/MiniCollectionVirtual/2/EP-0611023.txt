<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic tyre comprising a carcass (5) extending 
between beads (4) and a belt (6) disposed radially 

outside the carcass (5) and inside a tread (2) and 
having opposite axial edges (F1,F2), wherein the 

belt (6) comprises a ribbon (10) of rubber in which 
a plurality of cords (11) are embedded extending in 

the longitudinal direction thereof, and the ribbon 
(10) is continuously wound around the carcass (6) 

and folded back at the edges of the belt to extend 
zigzag between the edges of the belt so as to 

define ribbon segments comprising cord segments 
extending between the edges (F1,F2) of the belt, 

the cord segments including first cord segments 
(61) and second cord segments (62), the first cord 

segments (61) being laid substantially parallel to 
each other, and the second cord segments (62) being 

laid substantially parallel to each other and 
crosswise to the first cord segments (61) 

characterised in that the folding back of the 
ribbon (10) at each edge (F1,F2) is from radially  

 
inwards to outwards, the zigzag pitch (Pt) is 

substantially equal to an integral number of times 
the circumferential width (P) of the ribbon, 

whereby the ribbon segments (61,62) are arranged 
tightly together in the circumferential direction 

of the tyre with respect to the tyre equator, and 
the first cord segments (61) are inclined 

symmetrically to the second cord segments (62).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic tyre 
and more particularly an improvement in a tread 
reinforcing belt. In general, a radial pneumatic tyre is provided 
radially outside the carcass with a belt to 
reinforce the tread portion. In a conventional belt structure, as shown in 
Figs.7 and 8, a belt ply (p) is formed by wrapping 
a strip (e) of rubberised parallel cords (b) around 
the carcass. The strip (e) of rubberised parallel 
cords (b) is made by cutting a sheet of tyre fabric 
(d) at a bias angle (α). The ends (f) of the strip 
(e) are joined by overlapping one end on the other 
with a small overlap, and a lap joint running at 
the bias angle (α) is thus formed. The belt also 
has two side edges around the tyre circumference 
which have cut ends for the cords forming the belt. As a result of the bias joint, steering stability 
and directional stability during straight running  
 
are liable to be disturbed. This is particularly 
seen during high speed running. Further, 
durability is impaired due to the cord cut ends 
where rubber/cord separation failure arises leading 
to breaker edge looseness. In order to solve those problems, a jointless belt 
formed by spirally winding a continuous cord around 
the carcass at a small angle to the tyre equator 
has been proposed in, for example, Japanese 
Utility-Model Publication No.58-160805. However, 
due to the spiral cord arrangement, drifting of the 
vehicle to one side is liable to occur as the tyre 
has a sideways bias. It is therefore, an object of the present invention 
to provide a pneumatic tyre which can solve the 
problems of stability, durability and drifting. According to one aspect of the present invention, a 
pneumatic tyre comprises a carcass extending 
between beads and a belt disposed radially outside 
the carcass and inside a tread and having opposite 
axial edges, wherein the belt comprises a ribbon  
 
of rubber in which a plurality of cords are 
embedded extending in the longitudinal direction 
thereof, and the ribbon is continuously wound 
around the carcass and folded back at the edges of 
the belt to extend zigzag between the edges of the 
belt so as to define ribbon segments comprising 
cord segments extending between the edges of the 
belt, the cord segments including first cord 
segments and second cord segments, the first cord 
segments being laid substantially parallel to each 
other, and the second cord segments being laid 
substantially parallel to each other and crosswise 
to the first cord segments characterised in
