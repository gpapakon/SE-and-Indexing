<ABSTRACT>
A vibrating apparatus for vibrating a mold 1 by an 
electrohydraulic stepping cylinder 5 through a link 

mechanism 3 is characterized in that when a driving signal 
delivered into a drive unit 26 for the stepping cylinder 5, 

the actual acceleration of the mold 1 is fed back to a 
target waveform signal for the mold 1 and compensating 

signals for cancelling the operation delay of the stepping 
cylinder 5 and the signal transfer lag due to elastic 

deformation of the link mechanism and the like are added 
thereto to make feed-forward compensation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mold vibrating
apparatus for applying a predetermined vibration to the
mold during continuous casting operation.Vibrations are applied to the mold in continuous
casting equipment by a vibrating apparatus.The EP-A 0 570 935 which has not been published before the
earliest priority date of this patent describes a device for
moving a mold while shaking the entire structure of the mold
up and down. A control device comprises position detecting
means attached to the piston rod. A control signal is produced
by using the target horizontal position, the actual horizontal
position, and the predetermined offset value. Such control
signal indicates a deviation between the target horizontal
position and the detected actual horizontal position. A driving
means drives a hydraulic cylinder according to the control
signal.Another known vibrating apparatus of this type is disclosed in
Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 63562/1988.
In this vibrating apparatus, the mold is supported for
upward and downward movements in a vertical plane through a
four-bar link and a beam, with a hydraulic cylinder
connected to the front end of said beam for vibrating the
mold. The hydraulic circuit for feeding said hydraulic
cylinder with hydraulic pressure is provided with a servo
valve and a control circuit for controlling said servo
valve.In this control circuit, the rod position of the
hydraulic cylinder and the acceleration of the mold are 
detected by respective sensors. It is arranged that the
individual detected values are fed back to improve the
vibration transfer characteristic to allow the vibrations
of the mold to take a predetermined vibration waveform.
The reason why the vibration transfer characteristic
has to be improved in this manner is as follows.
Attempts have recently been made to generate in the
mold a saw-tooth vibration waveform adapted to increase and
decrease the upward and downward movements of the mold,
respectively, so as to improve the quality of the surfaces
of castings produced by continuous casting. Such saw-tooth
non-sinusoidal waveform contains harmonic wave components,
such as second and third. And under certain vibrating
conditions, the mechanical support structure including
beams for supporting the entire mold resonates with such
harmonic wave components, making it impossible to obtain a
predetermined vibration waveform. Therefore, the attempts
are intended to prevent the occurrence of such phenomena.
In this connection, it is to be noted that the above
arrangement
