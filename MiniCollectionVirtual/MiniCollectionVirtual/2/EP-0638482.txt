<ABSTRACT>
A dimensionally stable package wrapper (1) having an octagonal cross-section which is composed of a useful volume (12) of rectangular cross-section to receive a package (29) of cigarette packs or other cuboid objects and side regions (13) located on both sides of the useful volume (12) having a cross-section forming an isosceles trapezoid with the base line directed towards the side wall of the useful volume (12), the dimensional stability of the package wrapper (1) being guaranteed by shape inserts (14) of the same material fixed in its side regions (13) and each of the shape inserts consisting of a blank (15) in which a surface (16) is formed by folding and sticking, which surface corresponds to the side wall of the useful volume (12) and has a parallel pair of channels (22) of rectangular cross-section running in the longitudinal direction of the package wrapper (1), and the channels (22) being formed by defined compression into rhomboids inclined towards one another in such a way that the cross-section of the shape insert (14) thus formed is adapted to the cross-section of the side region (13), and the shape inserts (14) are bonded in this state into the side walls (5, 6) of the package wrapper (1).

<CLAIMS>
A form-stable product stack carton or carton vessel 
having an outer shape in the form of a prism comprising a 

bottom panel (3), a lid panel (4) and at least two 
oblique side panels (5,6) per side wall, characterised in 

that the product stack carton (1) has, as its outer 
shape, octagonal cross-section, which is composed of a 

useful space (12) of rectangular cross-section for the 
reception of a product stack (29) of cigarette boxes or 

other cuboid objects and lateral regions (13) which are 
situated on both sides of the useful space (12) and have 

the cross-section of an isosceles trapezium with a base 
line facing the side wall of the useful space (12), 

wherein the form stability of the product stack carton 
(1) is ensured by former inserts (14) of the same 

material fixed in its lateral regions (13), and each of 
the former inserts (14) consists of a blank (15) in which 

is formed, by folding and gluing, a panel (16) which 
corresponds to the side wall of the useful space (12) and 

which has a parallel pair of channels (22) of rectangular 
cross-section extending in the longitudinal direction of 

the product stack carton (1), and the channels (22) are 
deformed by a defined compression into rhombuses inclined 

against each other in such a way that the cross-section 
of the former insert (14) formed in this way is adapted 

to the cross-section of the lateral region (13) and the 
former inserts (14) are glued in this state into the side 

walls (5,6) of the carton (1), wherein at least one 
former insert (14) is on its side situated at the side 

panel (5) of the carton (1) provided with a notch (32) 
cooperating with a closure flap (31) of the lid panel 

(4), and wherein the lid panel (4) of the carton (1) is 
provided with score lines (33) which enable defined 

tearing of the lid panel (4) to open the carton (1).  
 
A form-stable product stack carton according to 
claim 1, characterised in that the panel (16) of the 

former insert (14) corresponding to the side wall of the 
useful space (12) comprises recesses (28) which enable 

gripping by a machine.
