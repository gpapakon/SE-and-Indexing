<ABSTRACT>
In a face-to-face or pile wire weaving loom a 
loom reed can prevent yarns from becoming entangled 

during the weaving of carpets and/or velvet, if at least 
one drop wire (3) made up of two parts (8, 13) is provided 

in the loom reed (1), which parts are parallel to 
each other, the rear part (13) of the drop wire (3) being 

staggered slightly parallel and laterally in the weft 
insertion direction relative to the front part (8) of the 

drop wire (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a loom reed with 
inbuilt deflector heald frame, comprising a reed rail at 
the bottom, a reed cap at the top, and two side bars 
between which a number of parallel drop wires or dents 
are situated. Such a loom reed is fixed on a lay of a 
face-to-face or a pile wire weaving loom, in order to 
separate a number of pile warp threads from each other 
during the weaving of carpets and/or velvet with yarns 
which have a tendency to become entangled. In face-to-face weaving with pile warp threads 
which have a great tendency to become entangled by the 
protruding filaments it is often necessary to separate 
those threads from each other again by providing a 
deflector heald frame in the zone between the harness 
containing the combined rows of upgoing and downgoing 
pile warp healds and the loom reed which moves to and from 
to beat up the weft or wefts. Such a deflector heald frame consists of a number 
of wire healds provided with two eyes, one at the top, by 
means of which the wire healds are threaded on a rod, and 
one at the bottom, by means of which the wire healds are 
fixed by a rod to the lay behind the loom reed. The 
deflector heald frame is connected to the loom reed and 
thus moves along with the loom reed, so that the wire 
healds comb the pile warp threads apart, with the result 
that the pile warp threads are separated from each other 
again in each case. The filament bridges occurring are thus combed 
out before they can build up very strong connecting 
bridges between the pile warp threads. The installation 
of such a deflector heald frame requires a certain amount 
of space in particular at the top behind the loom reed 
and at the bottom behind the loom lay, which beats up the 
weft after each pick. In order to be able to achieve such 
a fixing, the harness has to be pushed back about 3 cm. 
This displacement of the harness causes an increase in 
the lifts on the harness cords connected to the jacquard  
 
machine. These greater lifts cause a greater strain on the 
pile warp threads, with the result that the shot frequency 
of the weaving loom is limited. The efficiency of 
the weaving loom is also reduced as a result. Moreover, these wire or deflector healds are not 
capable of separating the pile warp threads from the 
foundation warp threads, so that pile warp threads can 
lie intertwined on the back of the carpet. Another solution is to place a second loom reed 
slightly staggered in the weft insertion direction 
relative to the first loom reed, so

<CLAIMS>
Loom reed (1) with inbuilt deflector heald frame 
(15), which reed is fixed on a loom lay (4) of a face-to-face or a pile wire weaving-loom 

configured to prevent weaving yarns running in the warp 
direction from becoming entangled during the weaving of 

carpets and/or velvets, said reed comprising a reed rail 
(2) at the bottom, a reed cap (17) at the top, and two 

side bars (18) between which a number of parallel drop 
wires (3) or reed dents all of the same nature are arranged, 

in order to separate a number of pile warp threads from 
each other, characterised in that each of the dents or flats wires (3) is built in one piece and is provided with a recess (14) which divides the dent or flat wire (3) into 

a front part (8) and a rear part (13), which are both 
parallel to the warp direction and laterally staggered or 

offset relative to one another in the weft direction. 
Loom reed according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that at least one drop wire (3) or dent is windowed, i.e. 

is provided with an elongated recess (14).
