exposed photographic sheet material with a processing liquid, 

which comprises : 

processing trays (54, 55) with a body of processing liquid, 
replenishing means (56, 57) for adding processing liquid to the 
station,

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photographic liquid processing
station with cleaning rollers, more in particular to a washing/rinsing
station for wash-off colour proofing material.Colour proofs are required for inspection and approval by the
printer or his client before printing on the production press
commences.According to a common colour proofing process, a non-hardened
gelatin silver halide emulsion layer containing coloured pigment
particles dispersed therein is transferred from a temporary onto a
permanent support which may already carry a halftone image containing
coloured hardened gelatin, the transferred silver halide emulsion layer
is imagewise exposed to a colour separation negative of the original,
a halftone image is formed by hardening development, the formed silver
image is removed by bleach-fixing, the selectively unhardened portions
of the transferred layer are selectively removed by wash-off
processing, and all these steps are repeated to form a composite layer
structure containing usually a cyan, a yellow, a magenta and a black-and-white
part image. The term wash-off processing implies treating
the permanent support with water to remove the unhardened portions
thereof, resulting in the accumulation of gelatin and pigments in the
rinsing water, but also rinsing the washed support in order to
eliminate the very last unhardened components that otherwise may cause
an undesirable hue in the final image.Treating the described support usually occurs by means of one or
more rinsing tanks through which the support is conveyed by means of
a plurality of pressure roller pairs dipping at least partly in the
rinsing liquid. At least the roller of each roller pair which is in
contact with the image-side of the support has a resilient covering,
which is partly compressed by the bias of the opposite roller of the
roller pair so that the resilient covering will creep and become
accelerated and decelerated during its rotation on the opposite roller, 
or on the support conveyed between the two rollers. The mentioned
acceleration and deceleration of the resilient roller covering causes
important frictional forces in the image layer which cause the
unhardened portions of the transferred layer to become washed off. The
washed-off material becomes dispersed in the rinsing tank(s) and does
not destroy the satisfactory washing-off of further supports, unless
the loading of the rinsing water exceeds a certain level. Replenishing
of the rinsing tank(s) with fresh water at regular intervals in
response to the

Photographic processing station (14) for treating an imagewise
exposed photographic sheet material with a processing liquid,

comprising:

a processing tray (54, 55) with a body of processing liquid, having
a liquid level (28, 48);
replenishing means (56, 57) for adding processing liquid to the
station;
driven pressure roller pairs (21, 22, 23, 24, 25) for conveying said
sheet material through said body of liquid; and
at least one cleaning roller (26, 27, 29), being in frictional
contact with at least one roller of said roller pairs and being

completely above said liquid level (28, 48);
characterised in that
the lower rollers of said roller pairs (21, 22, 23, 24, 25) are
dipping at least partially in the processing liquid;
said at least one cleaning roller (26, 27, 29) has a circumferential covering
of a pile fabric (34).
Photographic processing station according to claim 1, wherein
the lower rollers of the roller pairs are dipping completely in the

processing liquid and the upper rollers partially dip
therein.
Photographic processing station according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein the cleaning rollers (26, 27, 29) are driven by frictional

contact with the corresponding rollers of roller pairs (21, 22, 23,
24, 25).
Photographic processing station according to claim 1, 2 or 3,
wherein said cleaning rollers (26, 27, 29) are located between

successive roller pairs so that one cleaning roller is in frictional
contact with two rollers of adjacent roller pairs.

to 4, wherein a cleaning roller is in contact with the upper roller

of a pressure roller pair and the axis of such cleaning roller is
located higher than the axis of such upper roller(s) with which it is

in frictional contact. 
Photographic processing station according to any of claims 1
