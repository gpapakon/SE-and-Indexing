<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for detecting and controlling audible errors in a sound communication system at the receiver utilizes channel quality data and also iterative synthesis. Errors occurring in synthesized speech are detected by searching for atypical sound with a stringency dependent upon channel quality. The greater the channel quality deficiency is, the higher the typically standards will be. Errors are controlled by either re-synthesizing the signal in an interative way using typically standards which vary with channel quality deficiency, or by modifying the output signal using typicality standards which vary with channel quality deficiency, or both.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of audible communication and more particularly to speech coding and channel coding.In a sound communication system, an encoded signal is sent over a transmission channel to a receiver, where the incoming signal is used by a speech decoder to synthesize sound. Channel errors can adversely affect synthesized speech provided by the receiver, and there are several related art methods for concealing such channel errors.The most common method of concealing channel errors is to use cyclic redundancy check (CRC) to detect the errors in the most important bits and then perform bad frame handling in the speech decoder. This usually means replacing the erroneous parameters with the previously received good ones, or with slightly modified versions of the previous good ones.However, sometimes, this simple method of error detection and bad frame handling is not enough to prevent very audible errors from occurring. There are basically at least two reasons for this. The first reason is that the error detection code used in the CRC is often not 100% reliable, and therefore some erroneous frames are not marked as bad in the channel decoder; these frames, called Undetected Bad Frames (UBF), are then used in the normal speech synthesis in the speech decoder. This situation can produce very loud and audible artifacts in the synthesized speech. The second reason for the occurrence of audible errors is that, even after erroneous parameters have been replaced by previously received error-free parameters, the subsequent bad frame handling is sometimes unsuccessful and may produce audible artifacts.One typical related art method for concealing channel errors, in the situations just described, is to analyze the synthesized speech for atypical speech frames and then conceal those previously undetected or unsuccessfully handled bad speech frames. This type of related art system for analyzing and correcting the synthesized speech often involves concealment units in combination with the channel decoder (including error detection) and bad frame handling, but the concealment units can also be implemented standalone (i.e. separately from the channel decoder and bad frame handling).A major problem with related art algorithms for concealing errors in the synthesized speech is that those algorithms unintentionally conceal some error-free signals too, thus causing audible artifacts despite concealment measures. This is because of the rather non-stationary nature of a speech signal, which makes
