Method for regulating the frequency of a 
travelling wave motor (10) which has a stator (11), which 

is in the form of a disc and has a piezo-ring attached to 
it, and a rotor (12) which is in the form of a disc and 

is pressed against the piezo-ring via a friction layer, 
the piezo-ring being fitted with two groups of mutually 

alternating piezoelectric zones which are excited by AC 
voltages which are phase-shifted through 90° with respect 

to one another, in the case of which an actual variable 
which is proportional to the actual frequency is obtained 

from the amplitude of an AC voltage (sense voltage) which 
is picked off on the stator of the travelling wave motor, 

is compared with a required variable which is proportional 
to the required frequency, and the frequency of the 

exciter AC voltage is corrected using the control error, 
after subjecting it to a suitable control algorithm, 

characterized in that the required variable is derived 
from the amplitude modulation of the sense voltage. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the amplitude-modulated sense voltage is 

demodulated, rectified and compared with a predetermined 
amplitude-modulation required value, and in that the 

comparison difference is fed to a regulator (21) whose 
actuating signal, which is picked off at the output, is 

used as the required variable. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the amplitude-modulation required value is determined 

as a function of the elasticity of the friction 
layer between the stator (11) and the rotor (12) and the  

 
contact-pressure force between them. 
Regulating device for carrying out the regulating 
method according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized by a 

voltage-controlled oscillator (13) which supplies the 
exciter AC voltage for the travelling wave motor (10) and 

whose oscillator frequency can be adjusted by means of a 
control DC voltage which is applied to its control input, 

by a first regulator (14) which is connected upstream of 
the oscillator (13) and to which the control error, which 

is determined in a first subtractor (15), between an 
actual DC voltage, derived from the amplitude of the 

sense voltage, and a required DC voltage is fed and whose 
output is connected to the control input of the oscillator 

(13), by an amplitude demodulator (18) to which the 
sense voltage is fed, by a rectifier stage (19) which 

supplies a DC voltage which is proportional to the 
modulation level, by a second subtractor (20) to which on 

the one hand the difference voltage of the rectifier 
stage (19) and on the other hand a preset voltage, which 

corresponds to the amplitude-modulation required value, 
are fed and whose output voltage is applied to the input 

of the regulator, which represents a second regulator 
(21), and characterized in that the output signal of the 

second regulator (21) represents the required DC voltage 
which is fed to the first subtractor (15). 
Regulating device according to Claim 4, characterized 

in that the second regulator (21) is a PI regulator. 
Regulating device according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that the first regulator (14) is a PT₁ 

regulator.
