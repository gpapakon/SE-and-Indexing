<ABSTRACT>
[Object]
The present invention provides a novel secondary alcohol 
dehydrogenase useful for the synthesis of optically active 

alcohol and DNA encoding said enzyme. A microorganism 
belonging to genus 
Candida
 was found to produce a novel 
secondary alcohol dehydrogenase with a high stereochemical 

specificity. Using said enzyme, optically active alcohols 
were prepared, and by cloning of DNA encoding said enzyme, 

the base sequence of said DNA was determined. By providing 
a novel secondary alcohol dehydrogenase with a high stereochemical 

specificity and the gene encoding said enzyme, an 
efficient production of optically active alcohols became 

possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing a
novel secondary alcohol dehydrogenase useful for the preparation
of alcohol, aldehyde and ketone, especially for that of an optically
active alcohol, a method of producing said enzyme, a DNA
segment encoding said enzyme, a microorganism transformed with
said DNA, and a method of producing alcohol, aldehyde and ketone,
especially optically active alcohol using said enzyme.Of the secondary alcohol dehydrogenase of the microbial
origin requiring nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(abbreviated as NADP+ hereinafter), the one derived from Thermoanaerobium
brockii is well documented (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 108, 162-169
(1986)). In addition, of the secondary alcohol dehydrogenase
requiring nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (abbreviated as NAD+
hereinafter), there have been reported those derived from Pichia
sp. NRRL-Y-11328 (Eur. J. Biochem. 101, 401-406 (1979)), Pseudomonas
sp. SPD6 (Bioorg. Chem. 19, 398-417 (1991)), Pseudomonas
fluorescence NRRL B-1244 (Tokkai Sho, 59-17982), Pseudomonasmaltophilia MB11L (FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 93, 49-56 (1992)),
Pseudomonas sp. PED (J. Org. Chem. 57, 1526-1532 (1992)),
Pseudomonas sp. ATCC 21439 (Eur. J. Biochem. 119, 359-364
(1981)), Candida boidinii SAHM (Biochim. Biophys. Acta 716,
298-307 (1992)), Mycobacterium vaccae JOB-5 (J. Gen.
Microbiol. 131, 2901-2907 (1985)), Rhodococcus rhodochrous
PNKb1 (Arch. Microbiol. 153, 163-168 (1990)), Comamonas
terrigena (Biochim. Biophys. Acta 661, 74-86 (1981)), and
Arthrobacter sp. SBA (Tokkai Sho 51-57882).However, the stereochemical substrate specificity of these
secondary alcohol dehydrogenases is not satisfactory for the .
practical application. For example, as to 2-butanol, one of the
most frequently reported substrates of the secondary alcohol
dehydrogenase, there has not been reported the enzyme which will
oxidize (S)-2-butanol stereospecifically to produce 2-butanone.
(The enzymes derived from Pseudomonas sp. ATCC 21439, Pseudomonas
sp. SPD6, Comamonas terrigena, Candida boidinii SAHM or Pichia
sp. NRRL-Y-11328 oxidize (R)-isomer preferentially, while the one
derived from Pseudomonas fluorescens NRRL B-1244 does not show
any definite substrate stereochemical specificity, and the specificity
of the enzyme derived from Mycobacterium vaccae JOB-5,
Rhodococcus rhodochrous PNKb1, Pseudomonas sp. PED or Pseudomonas
maltophilia MB11L has not been reported.) Furthermore, although
the primary alcohol dehydrogenase (SADH-1) derived from baker's
yeast (Saccharomyces
