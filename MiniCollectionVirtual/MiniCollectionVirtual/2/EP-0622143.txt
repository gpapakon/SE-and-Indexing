<CLAIMS>
A drilling chuck, in particular for hammer drilling, having a 
chuck body (1) which can be connected to a drilling spindle, clamping 

jaws (5) which form between them a receiving means (4) for the drilling 
tool and which for opening and closing of th
e drilling chuck are 
displaceable by a clamping ring (8) rotatably guided on the chuck body 

(1), further having a locking device for the clamping ring (8) comprising 
a coaxial ring of locking openings (9) on the clamping ring (8) and at 

least one locking member (10) which is engaged substantially radially 
outwardly into the locking openings (9) under the force of a locking 

spring (11), wherein the locking member (10) and the locking openings (9) 
bear against each other at flank surfaces (14, 15') which are inclined in 

such a way that they lock the clamping ring (8) to prevent it from 
rotating in the direction of rotation corresponding to opening of the 

drilling chuck but when the clamping ring (8) is rotated in the opposite 
direction of rotation which therefore corresponds to closing of the 

drilling chuck they urge the locking member (10) out of the locking 
openings (9) against the force of the locking spring (11) and thereby 

cause it to slip from one locking opening to another, and having a 
coaxial setting ring (15) which is guided rotatably on the chuck body (1) 

and by the rotation of which the locking member (10) can be displaced 
into a condition of being disengaged from the locking openings (9), 

characterised in that there are provided abutments (16, 16') which 
positively lockingly limit the rotary movement of the setting ring (15) 

relative to the chuck body (1) in both directions of rotation, that the 
locking member (10) is arranged on a drag ring (17) which is rotatably 

mounted coaxially on the chuck body (1), that a re-adjusting spring (19) 
operative between the drag ring (17) and the chuck body (1) urges the 

drag ring (17) relative to the chuck body (1) in the same direction of 
rotation as that of the clamping ring (8) when closing the drilling 

chuck, that there are provided further abutments (18) which limit the 
rotary movement of the drag ring (17) relative to the chuck body (1) to 

the magnitude of the rotary movement of the clamping ring (8), that is 
desired for re-adjusting the clamping jaws (5), and that the maximum  

 
possible rotary movement of the setting ring (15) relative to that of the 

drag ring (17), in each case with respect to the chuck body (1), is at 
least so much greater as the setting ring (15) and the drag ring (17) 

have to be rotated relative to each other in order to displace the 
locking member (10) between the condition of being engaged at the locking 

openings (9) and the disengaged condition, wherein the locking member 
(10) is displaced out of the engaged condition into the disengaged 

condition and vice-versa by rotary movement of the setting ring (15) in 
the direction of rotation of the clamping ring (8), which corresponds to 

closing of the drilling chuck.

that the retaining element provided on the spring limb (23) is in the 
form of a retaining receiving means (22) arranged on the side of the limb 

which is towards the slot (24), and that the retaining projection (21) is 
in the form of a retaining peg which is disposed on the setting ring (15) 

and which axially engages into the slot (24) and which upon engagement 
into the retaining receiving means (22) urges the locking member (10) 

into the locking openings (9) in the clamping ring (8) and is 
displaceable upon rotation of the setting ring (15) relative to the drag 

ring (17) in the slot (24) between the retaining receiving means (22) and
