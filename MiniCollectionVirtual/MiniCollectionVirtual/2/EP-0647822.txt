<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a plate heat exchanger for exhanging heat between a first fluid and a second fluid. It comprises a casing (12) provided with an inlet tube (26) and an outlet tube for the second fluid, a stack of pannels arranged in pairs and alternately inside the casing about a central axis (32) along a stacking direction XX, each pair of plates comprising a first plate (30-1) and a second plate (30-2) which are respectively provided with a first inner cylindrical collar (34-1) and a second inner cylindrical collar (34-2) which surround the central tube (32) and extend parallel to the stacking direction while mutually overlapping. Application in particular to cooling the lubrication oil of a motor vehicle engine.

A plate-type heat exchanger for effecting heat
transfer between a first fluid, for example an oil to

be cooled, and a second fluid, for example a coolant
liquid, and comprising:


a casing (12) having an inlet pipe (26) and an outlet
pipe (28) for the second fluid;
a stack of plates (30) arranged in pairs (30-1, 30-2)
in alternating relationship within the casing, around a

central tube (32) defining a stacking direction XX, in

such a way that the plates of any one said pair define
between them a flow channel (42) for the first fluid,

with the pairs of plates defining between them, and
within the casing, flow channels (52) for the second

fluid which are in communication with each other; and
communication means (44, 48) adapted for flow of the
first fluid between the successive pairs of plates from

an inlet (58) for the first fluid to an outlet (32) for
the first fluid,

characterised in that each said pair of plates
comprises a first plate (30-1) and a second plate (30-2),

having, respectively, a first cylindrical internal
collar portion (34-1) and a second cylindrical internal 

collar portion (34-2), which surround the central tube
(32), extend parallel to the stacking direction XX, and

are in mutual overlapping relationship.
A heat exchanger according to Claim 1,

characterised in that the first plate (30-1) has a
generally flat annular face (36-1) joined directly to

the said first collar portion (34-1), while the second
plate (30-2) of the pair has a generally flat annular

face (36-2), which is joined to the second collar
portion (34-2) through a raised annular portion (38)

which is arranged to make contact with the flat annular
face (36-1) of the first plate (30-1) of an adjacent

pair, so as to form a sealed junction.
A heat exchanger according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterised in that the first collar portion (34-1)

lies between the central tube (32) and the second
collar portion (34-2).
A heat exchanger according to one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the first plate (30-1)

and the second plate (30-2) are formed, respectively,
with a circular first outer flange (40-1) and a

circular second outer flange (40-2), which are disposed
close to the housing and are in mutually overlapping

relationship.
A heat exchanger according to Claim 4,

characterised in that the circular first flange (40-1) 
lies between the circular second flange (40-2) and the

casing (12).
A heat exchanger according to Claim 4,

characterised in that the said circular second outer
flange (40-2) lies between the circular first outer

flange (40-1) and the casing (12).
A heat exchanger according to one of Claims 4 to 6,
characterised in that the circular first outer flange

(40-1) and the circular second outer flange (40-2) are
both rolled flanges.
