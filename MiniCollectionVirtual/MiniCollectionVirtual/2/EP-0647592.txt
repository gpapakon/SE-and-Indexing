<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for recovering CuCN from reaction mixtures of aromatic nitriles and copper(I) halides, characterised in that   a) the copper(I) halides are separated from the aromatic nitriles after the reaction of the aromatic halogenated compound with copper (I) cyanide is virtually complete, b) the fraction containing the copper(I) halides is treated with an aqueous solution of an alkali metal cyanide in such a way that an aqueous solution of alkali metal tetracyanocuprate is obtained, c) the solution thus obtained, if desired after purification, is added to a dilute mineral acid solution and   d) the CuCN which has crystallised out is separated off.   The process is preferably characterised in that in step a) a nonpolar solvent is added to the reaction mixture, with the copper(I) halides precipitating and being separated off, in that the steps a) and b) are carried out simultaneously by admixing the reaction mixture with a nonpolar solvent and an aqueous solution of an alkali metal cyanide and in that the alkali metal tetracyanocuprate solution obtained in step b) is treated with activated carbon and/or filtered.

Process for the recovery of CuCN from reaction 
mixtures of aromatic nitriles and copper (I) halides, 

characterized in that 

a) the copper (I) halides are separated off from the 
aromatic nitriles after the reaction of the aromatic 

halogenated compound with copper(I) cyanide is 
virtually complete, 
b) the fraction containing the copper(I) halides is 
admixed with an aqueous solution of 3.5 to 5 times 

the molar amount of alkali metal cyanide, based on 
the amount of CuCN originally used, which gives an 

aqueous solution of alkali metal tetracyanocuprate, 
c) the aqueous solution, if appropriate after purification, 
is added to a dilute mineral acid solution, 

and 
d) the CuCN crystallized out is separated off, 
 
either the reaction mixture itself prior to the process 

stage a), after distilling off up to 90% of solvent, or 
the aqueous solution obtained by process stage b), being 

admixed with an apolar solvent. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that an apolar solvent is added to the reaction mixture 

in step a), the copper(I) halides precipitating out and 
being separated off. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the steps a) and b) are carried out simultaneously 

by admixing the reaction mixture with an apolar solvent 
and an aqueous solution of an alkali metal cyanide. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the alkali metal tetracyanocuprate  

 
solution obtained in step b) is treated with activated 

carbon and/or filtered. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the hydrocyanic acid formed in step 

c) is passed through an alkali metal hydroxide solution 
and the resulting alkali metal cyanide solution is reused 

in step b). 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the aromatic halogenated compound 

used is an aromatic iodine compound, bromine compound or 
chlorine compound. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the alkali metal cyanide used in 

step b) is lithium cyanide, sodium cyanide or potassium 
cyanide, preferably sodium cyanide. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that at least 60% of all of the solvent in the reaction 

mixture is removed before the apolar solvent is added. 
Process according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the remaining residue is admixed with an ether. 
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the reaction mixture is admixed with water, an 

alkali metal cyanide is added and the mixture is 
extracted with an organic solvent at elevated temperature 

and the phases are separated.
