<ABSTRACT>
An improved biodegradable controlled release system consisting of a polymeric matrix incorporating a local anesthetic for the prolonged administration of the local anesthetic agent, and a method for the manufacture thereof, are disclosed. The polymers and method of manufacture used to form the PLAMs are selected on the basis of their degradation profiles: release of the topical anesthetic in a linear, controlled manner over a period of preferably two weeks and degradation (in vivo) with a half-life of less than six months, more preferably two weeks, to avoid localized inflammation. Alternatively, a non-inflammatory can be incorporated into the polymer with the local anesthetic to prevent inflammation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The U.S. Government has rights in this
invention pursuant to National Institutes of Health
Grant No. GM-15904 to Harvard Anesthesia Research
and Teaching Center to C. Berde, and Grant No. CA
5257 to R. Langer.This invention is generally in the field of
anesthesiology and, in particular, the delivery of
anesthetic agents which locally block pain for
periods of time of less than about two weeks.In order to provide local or regional
blockade for extended periods, clinicians currently
use local anesthetics administered through a
catheter or syringe to a site where the pain is to
be blocked. This requires repeated administration
where the pain is to be blocked over a period of
greater than one day, either as a bolus or through
an indwelling catheter connected to an infusion
pump. These methods have the disadvantage of
potentially causing irreversible damage to nerves
or surrounding tissues due to fluctuations in
concentration and high levels of anesthetic. In
addition, anesthetic administered by these methods
are generally neither confined to the target area,
nor delivered in a linear, continuous manner. In
all cases, analgesia rarely lasts for longer than
six to twelve hours, more typically four to six
hours. In the case of a pump, the infusion lines
are difficult to position and secure, the patient
has limited, encumbered mobility and, when the
patient is a small child or mentally impaired, may
accidentally disengage the pump. Drugs are typically administered in a
variety of ways, including by injection, topical
administration, oral ingestion, and sustained
release devices. Methods which provide for
systemic, rather than localized, delivery are not
an option with local anesthetics since these could
interfere with the patient's ability to breathe, if
administered systemically. Devices could
potentially provide for a sustained, controlled,
constant localized release for longer periods of
time than can be achieved by injection or topical
administration. These devices typically consist of
a polymeric matrix or liposome from which drug is
released by diffusion and/or degradation of the
matrix. The release pattern is usually principally
determined by the matrix material, as well as by
the percent loading, method of manufacture, type of
drug being administered and type of device, for
example, microsphere. A major advantage of a
biodegradable controlled release system over others
is that it does not require the surgical removal of
the drug depleted device, which is slowly degraded
and absorbed by the patient's
