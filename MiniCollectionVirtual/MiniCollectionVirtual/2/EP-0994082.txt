<CLAIMS>
A method for treating slag resulting from incineration
of household waste, in which


the slag is seasoned for a seasoning period,
this slag is mixed with a cement,
the mixture obtained thereby is used in subsequent
processes,
characterised in that
the cement selected is a cement containing about 95
% clinker, which cement includes tricalcium

aluminium and a tricalcium aluminium content is less
than 5 % by weight.
The method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
the cement selected is a cement containing about 95
% clinker, and including tricalcium aluminium in a

quantity less than 2 % by weight.
The method according to either of claims 1 or 2,

characterised in that
the cement selected is a cement containing about 95
% clinker and containing a retarding agent.
The method according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
an anhydrous calcium sulphate or a hydrated calcium
sulphate in a ratio from 0.5 % to 5 % by weight of

the cement is chosen as the retarding agent.
The method according to any of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
for a given production of slag, an expansion of a
sample of the slag is measured after the elapse of a

certain time,
the quantity of cement to be included in the mixture
for this production is determined on the basis of

this expansion measurement and with reference to the
intended use for the slag.
The method according to any of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that
for a given production of slag, an expansion of a
sample of the slag is measured after the elapse of a

certain time,
the slag from this production is reserved for a
class of application on the basis of this expansion

measurement.
The method according to either of claims 5 or 6,

characterised in that
the expansion is measured for a constant volume
using a pressure variation measurement.
The method according to any of claims 5 to 7,
characterised in that
the expansion is measured by subjecting the slag in
the sample to aeration or tempering.
The method according to any of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that
for the treatment of the slag, its non-ferrous metal
content, particularly aluminium, is eliminated,

particularly using an eddy current magnetizer.
