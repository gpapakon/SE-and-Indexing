<ABSTRACT>
A nuclear medicine image is scanned and pixels of maximum and minimum intensity are identified and correlated with each other using constraints which are empirically determined to relate to the feature of interest (such as the heart). The information thus obtained is used to define a region of interest in which an anatomical feature of interest may be located, and to position a scintillation camera detector to carry out a nuclear medicine study at optimal positions. To properly position a subject patient, anatomical landmarks relating to a target organ are automatically identified by a computer. The landmarks are superimposed upon a nuclear medicine persistence image of the target organ. This facilitates technician identification of the target organ and also facilitates repeatability of, e.g., myocardial perfusion studies, which require that two studies be performed on a single patient at two different times. To determine the depth of the target organ, two planar nuclear medicine images of a target organ are acquired using a focussing collimator at two different heights. An anatomical landmark associated with the target organ is computer-identified in each of the images, and the depth of the target organ is determined geometrically using the differences in size between the images of the identified landmark and the differences in height.

<DESCRIPTION>
 -EDENÏ€FICATIO OF ANATOMICAL FEATURES FROM DATATechnical FieldThe invention relates to nuclear medicine and, more particularly, to images produced by nuclear medicine studies of patient organs. In its most immediate sense, the invention relates to nuclear medicine studies of the heart, proper positioning of a patient in studies of patient organs, and determinations of the depth of an organ, such as the heart, within the body. Background ArtIn contrast with nuclear medicine studies, modalities such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging produce clearly defined images. However, this is not the case in nuclear medicine, e.g. cardiac bloodpool studies - - which are concerned more with functional determinations such as ejection fractions rather than the location of malignant regions as in other studies. Here, since cardiac tissue is engorged with blood and the tissue adjoins blood pools within the heart, there are no sharp edges (as exist with images produced by other modalities) and even under the best of circumstances it is difficult to locate exactly that portion of the image which relates to, e.g. , the left ventricle. Thus, it is necessary to identify such organ features as the interventricular septum, the left ventricle, and the right ventricle.Attempts have been made to use edge detection methods to identify the location of anatomical features, but such attempts have been unsuccessful.- This is because the data used to construct such images is contaminated by scatter and attenuation. Additionally, nuclear medicine images become even more ambiguous because of low resolution, low 

signal-to-noise ratio, and the presence of radioactivity from adjacent organs and background tissue. Consequently, conventional detection methods are not helpful in identifying anatomical structures of interest; these methods may locate an edge which is without diagnostic significance and may overlook an edge which is highly important.Additionally, it frequently happens that the camera is mispositioned with respect to the patient's target organ (i.e., the organ of interest). (This may happen where the patient has, e.g., an abnormally oriented heart, or where the patient shifts position after being positioned properly.) Even an experienced technician needs substantial time to collect enough data to assess the positioning of the patient and to correct any mispositioning, and an inexperienced technician may need to repeat these steps one or more times before the patient is positioned properly.
