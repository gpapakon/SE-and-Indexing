<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for desmutting 
aluminum and aluminum alloy surfaces, especially those of 
high silicon aluminum alloys, by contacting the surfaces 
with a particular aqueous liquid composition. Common chemical and even mechanical treatments of 
aluminum often leave the surface with a dark coating that 
must be removed before subsequent surface finishing steps 
can be satisfactorily completed. This process is generally 
known in the art as "desmutting" or sometimes as "deoxidizing". 
Current commercial desmutting practice normally uses 
oxidizing acid solutions containing some form of chromium(VI). 
This material, of course, has severe pollution 
potential, so that an alternative, equally effective desmutting 
composition and/or process would be highly desirable.  
 Some desmutting compositions without chromium have 
previously been known in the art. For example, "Research 
Disclosure" 273,037 according to an abstract thereof teaches 
desmutting in concentrated nitric acid; Japanese Laid-Open 
Patent Application 59-1,699 according to an abstract 
thereof teaches desmutting in a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric 
acids; published British patent application GB 
1,399,111 according to an abstract thereof teaches desmutting 
with a solution of ammonium persulfate, sodium bisulfate, 
and ammonium nitrate; U. S. Patent 3,634,262 according 
to an abstract thereof teaches desmutting in a solution 
containing alkali, alkaline earth, or ammonium peroxydisulfate(s); 
acid salts of sulfuric acid; and, optionally, 
fluorides; U. S. Patent 3,647,698 according to an abstract 
thereof teaches desmutting with a solution of urea nitrate 
and ferric sulfate, optionally also including boric acid 
and/or fluoride ions; and U. S. Patent 3,510,430 according 
to an abstract thereof teaches desmutting with a solution 
of ferric sulfate, alkali metal bisulfate, alkali metal nitrate, 
and alkali metal silicofluoride. None of these 
teachings is believed to have achieved substantial commercial 
success. Also, in this 
description and claims, except where the context implies 
otherwise, the term "aluminum" is to be understood to include 
all the alloys of aluminum that contain at least 45 
% by weight of aluminum. It has surprisingly been found that the presence of 
manganese(IV) in desmutting solutions improves their performance.  
 
More specifically, a desmutting composition according 
to this invention includes an oxidizing inorganic 
acid, phosphoric and sulfuric acids, simple and complex 
fluoride ions,
