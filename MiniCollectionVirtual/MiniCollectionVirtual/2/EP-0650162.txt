<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for 
printing disc-shaped registration carriers, whereby a print built up of 

several colours is provided on the registration carrier. Use is made of 
a printing cylinder, which is moved over a few printing plates, which have 

been moistened with various colours of ink, whereby said printing cylinder 
is subsequently roll
ed over the registration carrier. The device comprises 
a plurality of processing stations for registration carriers, as well as 

transport means by which the disc-shaped registration carriers can be moved 
from one processing station to the other processing station. One or more 

processing stations comprise a printing device disposed therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for treating disc-shaped
registration carriers, wherein said registration carriers are moved
in steps in a predetermined path of movement along a plurality of
processing stations, in each of which said registrations carriers are
subjected to a certain processing step.The term registration carriers is understood to mean
sound and/or picture carriers and/or data carriers and the like, for
example so-called compact discs, as well as carriers which can be processed
at a later stage in order for sound, pictures or other data to be
registered to be recorded thereon.A method of the above kind can be derived from prior
Dutch Patent Application 9201065. As described in said patent
application the registration carriers are thereby taken to various stations
along a predetermined path, whereby a processing step is carried out in
at least a number of said stations, such as for example the application
of an amount of paint, the even spreading of the paint over the
registration carrier surface, the curing and/or drying of the paint, the
checking of the registration carrier, etc.In many cases it is also desirable to provide a print
on every registration carrier, which print may for example give information
with regard to the sound and/or picture and/or information recorded on
the registration carrier. To an increasing extent a multicolour print is
being requested thereby.From European Patent Application 0528106 a method is
known for treating registration carriers, for printing said registration
carriers, whereby the registration carriers are supplied to a rotary table,
by means of which the registration carriers are moved past a few stations,
in each of which a screen-printing machine is disposed, by means of which
a print of a certain colour is put on the registration carrier. This
putting on of several colours in several steps is time-consuming and
furthermore requires a specialized and voluminous arrangement, which is
exclusively suitable for providing a colour print.From Patent Abstracts of Japan Vol. 13. No. 580(P980),
21st December 1989, a device for printing optical discs can be derived. 
This device comprises a table which is rotatable about a vertical axis
of rotation, to which table the optical discs are supplied in succession
and by means of which the optical discs present on the rotary table are
moved in steps. The device is provided with means for putting four
differently coloured inks on the optical discs. Said means are constructed
in such a manner, that each colour is

<CLAIMS>
A method for treating disc-shaped registration
carriers, wherein said registration carriers are moved in steps in a

predetermined path of movement along a plurality of processing stations,
in each of which said registrations carriers are subjected to a certain

processing step, characterized in that a printing cylinder is rolled over
a registration carrier present a respective station, whereby said printing

cylinder is moved to and fro through the station in question during
operation, in a direction transversely to the path of movement of the

registration carrier, and also over a few printing plates arranged one
behind the other near said stati
on, seen in the intended direction of
movement of the printing cylinder, which printing plates are moistened

with various colours of ink during operation.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that
the registration carrier is provided with a coating over at least part

of its surface area prior to the provision of the multicolour print.
A method according to claim 2, characterized in that
a white coating is applied.
A method according to claim 2 or 3, characterized
in that said coating is dried prior to the provision of said multicolour

print.
A method according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that successive registration carriers are moved

along a conveying path in steps and that said printing cylinder is moved
to and fro, in a direction transversely to said conveying path, over a

few printing plates and over the registration carriers to be printed.
A method according to claim 5, characterized in that
during the stepwise movement of the registration carriers along a number

of stations a coating is first applied in one of said stations, after which
a multicolour print is put on in another station.
A device for carrying out the method according to
any one of the preceding claims, said device being provided with a

plurality of processing stations comprising support means for supporting
said registration carriers in said processing stations, and with transport

means by which said disc-shaped registration carriers can be moved from
one processing station to the other processing station along a conveying 

path, characterized in that said device is provided with a printing device
disposed near a processing station, said printing device comprising a

printing cylinder, which is reciprocatingly movable in a direction
transversely to the conveying path, in order to transfer a print image

comprising several colours from a few printing plates to a disc-shaped
registration carrier present in the respective processing station, whilst

a few inking rollers coupled with the printing cylinder can be moved to
and fro along with the printing cylinder between an inking unit and the

respective printing plates.
A device according to claim 7, characterized in that
said printing cylinder and said inking rollers are journalled in a slide,

which is movable between a first position, in which said inking rollers
are in contact with means by which ink can be transferred from inking units

to said inking rollers and in which said printing plates are located
between said printing cylinder and the station in which a registration

carrier to be printed can be positioned, and a second position, in which
said printing cylinder has been moved over a registration carrier present

in a processing station and in which said inking rollers have been moved
over respective printing plates, whereby several inking units and inking

rollers co-acting therewith as well as several printing plates are provided
are provided one behind the other, seen in the direction of movement of

said slide.
A device according to claim 7 or 8, characterized
in that guide means are provided for moving the inking rollers upwards

and downwards, all this in such a manner that during the reciprocating
motion of the slide during operation an inking roller only comes in contact

extends substantially tangentially with respect to the path along which
the registration carriers are conveyed.
A device according to any one of the preceding
claims 7 - 10, characterized in that means are provided by which said

printing cylinder is vertically adjustable, in such a manner that when 
the printing cylinder moves away from the station containing the

printed registration carrier, said printing cylinder can be moved over
the respective registration carrier and the printing plates without coming

into contact with said registration carrier and said printing plates.
