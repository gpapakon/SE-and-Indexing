<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivatives, and 
more particularly to bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivatives which bind 
to cholecystokinin and/or gastrin receptors. The invention also 
relates to methods for preparing such bicyclo[2.2.2]octane 
derivatives and to compounds which are useful as intermediates in 
such methods. Gastrin and the CCK's are structurally-related neuropeptides which 
exist in gastrointestinal tissue and in the CNS (see Mutt V., 
GastrointestinalHormones, Glass G.B.J., ed., Raven Press, N.Y., 
p 169 and Nisson G., ibid, p. 127). Gastrin is one of the three primary stimulants of gastric acid 
secretion. Several forms of gastrin are found including 34-, 17-, 
and 14-amino acid species with the minimum active fragment being 
the C-terminal tetrapeptide (TrpMetAspPhe-NH2) which is reported 
in the literature to have full pharmacological activity (see Tracey 
H.J. and Gregory R.A., Nature (London), 1964, 204, 935). Much 
effort has been devoted to the synthesis of analogues of this 
tetrapeptide (and the N-protected derivative Boc-TrpMetAspPhe-NH2) 
in an attempt to elucidate the relationship between structure and 
activity. Natural cholecystokinin is a 33 amino acid peptide (CCK-33), the 
C-terminal 5 amino acids of which are identical to those of 
gastrin. Also found naturally is the C-terminal octapeptide (CCK-8) 
of CCK-33. The cholecystokinins are reported to be important in the regulation 
of appetite. They stimulate intestinal motility, gall bladder 
contraction, pancreatic enzyme secretion, and are known to have a 
trophic action on the pancreas. They also inhibit gastric emptying 
and have various effects in the CNS. Compounds which bind to cholecystokinin and/or gastrin receptors 
are important because of their potential pharmaceutical use as  
 
antagonists of the natural peptides. A number of gastrin antagonists have been proposed for various 
therapeutic applications, including the prevention of gastrinrelated 
disorders, gastrointestinal ulcers, Zollinger-Ellison 
syndrome, antral G Cell hyperplasia and other conditions in which 
lowered gastrin activity is desirable. The hormone has also been 
shown to have a trophic action on cells in the stomach and so an 
antagonist may be expected to be useful in the treatment of 
cancers, particularly in the stomach. Possible therapeutic uses for cholecystokinin antagonists include 
the control of appetite disorders such as anorexia nervosa, and the 
treatment of pancreatic inflammation, biliary tract disease and 
various
