<ABSTRACT>
Polymers and copolymers of propylene are modified by grafting 
with polyalkenylenes having a trans double bond content of 

higher than 30%.
 

The preparation is carried out via thermic treatment of the 
propylene (co)polymer with said polyalkenylene at a temperature 

comprised between 200 and 350°C an the presence of a free 
radical initiator other than peroxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention regards propylene homo- and co-polymers
grafted with polyalkenylenes and process for preparing them by
reactive transformation of the homo- or co-polymer of
polypropylene in the presence of polyalkenylene and particular
non-peroxide radical initiators.Modifying crystalline propylene homo- and co-polymers by
degradation at high temperatures with non-peroxide radical
initiators is known, obtaining a marked improvement in the
fluidity in the melted state and therefore processability.Japanese patent 58-090291 describes the use of alkyl and
bromo derivatives of 1,2-diphenylethane as radical initiator
in the controlled degradation process of propylene polymers.
The polymers obtained show good rheological properties; yet at
the same time the mechanical properties, in particular the
impact strength, are worsened.The same problems are found with the products obtained
according to the process described in US patent no. 4,556,695,
in which the controlled degradation is carried out using chlorinated
derivatives of 1,2-diphenyl ethane.In the US patent no. 4,948,820, the selective degradation
of crystalline propylene polymers and copolymers at a temperature
comprised between 250 and 300°C through the use of particular
benzopinacol derivatives is described; also in this
case the degraded polymers are obtained with controlled rheology,
but in none of the cases was the impact strength of the 
material improved.Modifying crystalline propylene polymers by treating at
temperatures comprised between 250 and 300°C with α-olefin
polymers and copolymers, for example 1-butene, in the presence
of a peroxide radical initiator, is also known from European
patent 261,786. Even operating in this way the modified product
obtained does not show improved impact strength properties
and in addition the presence of the peroxide initiator can
give rise to secondary crosslinking reactions of the polymer.Modifying the propylene polymer properties by blending
with elastomers is known. In particular, blends of isotactic
polypropylene with poly trans octenamer rubber (TOR) are known
(Journal of Material Science 27 pag. 1171-1174, 1992). However
the mechanical properties of these blends, in particular the
impact strength, are not improved in any way.The modification of polypropylene by using poly trans
octenamer rubber crosslinked with a radical crosslinking
agent consisting of m-phenylene-bis-maleimide has also been
described (Plastic, Rubber and Composite Processing and Applications,
18, pag. 47-58, 1992). The blends so
