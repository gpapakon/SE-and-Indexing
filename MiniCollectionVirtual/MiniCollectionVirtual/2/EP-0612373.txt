<ABSTRACT>
A device for identifying the position of a shaft of an internal combustion engine has a generator disk linked with the shaft and having at least one reference mark. The generator disk is scanned by a sensor and the thus obtained output signals are evaluated in a control apparatus. For the position of the shaft to be known as soon as the internal combustion engine is started, the last detected position of the shaft after the internal combustion engine is turned off and the shaft has stopped is stored in a non-volatile storage of the control apparatus and is used when the internal combustion engine is restarted to determine and control the first injections during a starting phase. In order to improve accuracy, sense of rotation identification is also provided, so that a correction may be carried out should the shaft turn slightly backwards when the engine swings back.

<CLAIMS>
Device for detecting the position of at least one 
shaft which has a reference mark or at least one disc 

which has a reference mark and is connected to the shaft, 
in an internal combustion engine having at least one 

fixed sensor which supplies a sensor signal which is 
dependent on the respective position of the shaft and is 

fed to an evaluation device in order to control the 
ignition and/or fuel injection of the internal combustion 

engine, after the ignition is switched off after-running 
taking place during which the evaluation device evaluates 

the sensor signal until the shaft comes to a standstill, 
characterized in that during the after-running the 

position of the shaft when at a standstill is stored in 
a non-volatile memory and this position is included in 

the control of the fuel injection when the engine is 
switched on again. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the evaluation device is the control device. 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the at least one shaft is the crankshaft and/or 

camshaft of the internal combustion engine and in each 
case an assigned sensor is present. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the crankshaft and the camshaft of the internal 

combustion engine are connected to discs, the crankshaft 
disc having a plurality of marks and at least one reference 

mark and the camshaft disc having one mark or a 
plurality of marks matched to the number of cylinders, 

and the phase position being determined by means of a  
 

defined position of the mark on the camshaft disc with 
respect to the reference mark of the crankshaft disc or 

by means of an unambiguously defined sequence of marks on 
the camshaft disc. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that, in order to determine exactly the 

position of the crankshaft, the number of increments 
after the occurrence of the reference mark is counted. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that, in order to determine exactly the 

position of the camshaft, the number of increments is 
counted out in relation to the phase position. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that when the engine is switched on 

again after the detection of the reference marks of the 
crankshaft and/or of the camshaft, a synchronization is 

carried out and the system goes over to normal determination 
of the injection angular position. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a detection of the direction of 

rotation takes place. 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that a correction of the shut-off position takes place if 

the internal combustion engine turns backwards after the 
ignition has been shut off and the correction takes place 

by counting out the increments during the reverse travel. 
Device according to one of the preceding Claims 1 
to 8, characterized in that a correction of the shut-off 

position takes place if the internal combustion engine 
turns backwards after the ignition has been shut off, the 

correction taking place by comparing the determined shut-off 
position and the crankshaft position found during the 

synchronization. 
Device according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that adaptable correction variables are formed and the 

adaptation preferably takes place in a cylinder-selective 
fashion.
