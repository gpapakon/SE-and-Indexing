Attachment device, in particular for an electric 
toothbrush drive, with a housing (1) and a movement 

converter disposed in the housing, characterised in that the 
movement converter (3, 4, 10, 13) comprises a swing arm (3), 

which is operatively connected to a drive shaft (6) of the 
toothbrush drive (2) by means of a guide (11) and has a 

plug-in pin (10) disposed at the distal end and preferably 
at a right angle, as well as a rotary oscillating plate (4), 

which is mounted by means of a pivot bearing (7) at the 
housing (1) and has an eccentrically disposed plug-in hole 

(13) in which the plug-in pin (10) engages, wherein a 
movement of the drive shaft (6) having axial and radial 

components is converted into a movement of the rotary 
oscillating plate (4) executing rotary oscillations about 

the plug-in pin (10). 
Attachment device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the end of the housing (1) which is remote from the 

drive shaft (6) is formed as a two-part pivot bearing (7) 
for the rotary oscillating plate (4), wherein one part of 

the pivot bearing (7) is in the form of a cap (8), which can 
be detachably secured to the housing (1) by means of a snap-action 

connection (9). 
Attachment device according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that a dental treatment tool (12) can be 

detachably connected to the rotary oscillating plate (4).
