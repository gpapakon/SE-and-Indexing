<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor luminous element is a surface-emitting 
type element with a microscope luminous 

region and has a constricted current path, which is 
formed so that the current flows only in the region 

directly below a window (28). The window (28) is 
formed in the center of a p-electrode (32). The p-electrode 

includes a segment (32a), which surrounds 
the window, and a segment (32b) of thin bands of 

electrode which traverse the window in the form of a 
cross, dividing it into four equal regions. As a 

result, there is no drop in luminous output in the 
center of the window (28), and the total luminous 

output is enhanced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a semiconductor luminous 
element of the type which emits light from its surface. 
This luminous element has a high output and a luminous 
surface of microscopic dimensions. Such elements are 
essential in the fields of optical communication and 
optical data processing. The invention concerns a luminous 
device, a photocoupler, an optical detector, an optical 
data processor, a photoemissive device and an optical fiber 
module which employ the said semiconductor luminous 
element. Figures 1 (a) and (b) show a cross section and a 
partially cut away magnified plan view of a surface-emitting 
type semiconductor luminous element with a 
microscopic luminous area. Semiconductor luminous element 
A consists of n-lower cladding layer 2, which covers the 
surface of n-semiconductor substrate 1; p-active layer 3; 
p-upper cladding layer 4; p-upper cladding layer 5; p-cap 
layer 6, which is epitaxially grown as a succession of 
layers; and layer 7 of reversed conductivity, which is 
formed after cap layer 6 has been completed by injecting n-type 
ions into all of upper cladding layer 5 except the 
central portion, which can then serve as current path 8. 
Electrode 9 on the p side is formed on the upper surface of 
cap layer 6. Window 10, through which the light can exit, 
is provided in electrode 9 in line with the current path. 
Electrode 11, on the n side, is formed on the lower surface 
of semiconductor substrate 1.  When voltage is applied between electrode 9 on the p 
side and electrode 11 on the n side, the plane consisting 
of the lower surface of reversed layer 7 and upper cladding 
layer 5 assumes an opposite bias, causing the current to 
flow only in current path 8, which is surrounded by layer 
7. The current is thus caused to flow only to the region 
of active layer 3 which is directly in line with current 
path 8, and only this region will emit light. Thus, 
semiconductor luminous element A uses a constricted current 
design. With a semiconductor luminous element A as shown in 
Figures 1 (a) and (b), the current is concentrated between 
cap layer 6 and p-electrode 9 on the inner periphery of 
electrode 9. If the diameter of the luminous region is, 
for example, 50 µm, the luminous output in the center of 
window 10 will be nearly 90% lower than that of the 
periphery, resulting in a ring-shaped pattern of light 
emission. Another problem is that the most intense light is 
concentrated directly below p-electrode 9 just outside 
window 10. The light emitted by active layer 3,
