<ABSTRACT>
A user-replaceable liquid toner cartridge (20) fits into a receptacle 
(42) in an EP printer (10). The receptacle (42) includes automatic fluid and 

mechanical connectors (52,54,56) that mate with the cartridge (20) upon its 
insertion. The cartridge (20) includes a liquid toner supply reservoir (60), a 

pump (74,76) connected to an outlet (80) from the reservoir (60); a mechanical 
coupling (68,72) that automatically engages a pump actuator (52) that extends 

from the receptacle (42); and a three-port valve (86). The three-port valve (86) 
is connected to an output (84) from the pump (74,76) and has a first port (102) 

that communicates with the reservoir and a second port (96) that communicates 
with an external wall of the cartridge (20) where it connects to a fluid fitting 

(56) in the receptacle (42) upon insertion of the cartridge. The fluid fitting in 
the receptacle also automatically operates the valve (86) in the cartridge (20) 

and redirects liquid toner flow from a recirculation path to the cartridge's 
reservoir (60) and directs it into the receptacle's fluid fitting (56).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrophotographic (EP) printing and, 
more particularly, to a user-replaceable liquid toner cartridge for an EP printer. To maintain costs as low as possible, EP printers are now designed 
to allow as much user maintenance as possible. To this end, dry toner EP 
printers enable a user to replace the toner cartridge which also contains an 
entirely new organic photoconductor-coated drum and related actuating 
mechanisms. EP printers which employ liquid toners are provided with refillable 
toner reservoirs, thus requiring the user to replenish the in-printer reservoir from 
a liquid toner supply. The user is thus exposed to possible spillage, vapors, and, 
with color printers, the possibility that a wrong color toner will be loaded into a 
reservoir. Because liquid toners contain toner particles in a liquid carrier, the 
particles may settle to the bottom of the toner container unless provisions are 
made to either agitate the liquid toner or to provide means for its continuous 
circulation. Prior art printers have included liquid toner pumps and valve 
mechanisms for the recirculation of the liquid toner. Since such pumps and 
valves were part of the printer, their reliability was required to be equal to that 
of the printer. However, over a period of time, the liquid toner was found to 
coat the internal surfaces of the pump and valve mechanisms with a paint-like 
substance that eventually impaired their working parts. US-A-3 973 699 discloses a user-replaceable liquid toner cartridge comprising pump means, an inlet fluid opening, an outlet fluid opening in addition to the liquid reservoir. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide an 
improved, user-replaceable, liquid toner cartridge for an EP printer. It is another object of this invention to provide an improved, user-replaceable, 
liquid toner cartridge which requires only two fluid connections. It is yet another object of this invention to provide an improved, 
user-replaceable, liquid toner cartridge that incorporates mechanisms that are  
 
likely to fail prior to the end of the useful life of the printer. It is still another object of this invention to provide a user-replaceable 
toner cartridge wherein all connections to the cartridge are 
automatically made upon insertion of the cartridge into a printer. A user-replaceable liquid toner cartridge fits into a receptacle in an 
EP printer. The receptacle includes automatic fluid and mechanical connectors 
that mate with the cartridge upon its insertion.
