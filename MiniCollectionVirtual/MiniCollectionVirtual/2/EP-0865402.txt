<ABSTRACT>
A pre-stretching mechanism, for use in an orbital wrapping apparatus whereby a web (6) of plastics film is drawn from a feed roll (5) of film and applied to an object to be wrapped by virtue of relative rotational movement of the object and the roll, comprises a braking roller (9) in contact with the feed roll, a stretching roller (7) in contact with the web and drive transmission means (10, 11, 12) connecting the rollers such that the surface speed of the stretching roller in the direction of film movement exceeds that of the braking roller in that direction, wherein the feed roll is mounted for rotation upon slideable saddles (16) and the contact pressure between the braking roller and feed due to tension in the drawn-off web is augmented by loading springs (18) to an extent such that slippage occurs between the feed roll and the braking roller before draw-off tension in the web reaches a value at which the web would neck down and break.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to packaging processes in which an object to 
be packaged (which may be a single article or a plural assembly of articles) 
is wrapped in pre-stretched plastics film. More particularly, the invention 
relates to the mechanism used to stretch the film immediately before it is 
applied to the object. Such processes are frequently referred to as stretch 
wrapping processes and such mechanisms are frequently referred to as 
pre-stretching mechanisms. Stretch wrapping utilises film having the property known as 
"memory", that is to say a tendency to recover its former shape or size, 
after having been strained beyond its elastic limit, some short while after the 
straining force has been relaxed. Plastics wrapping film is normally provided to the user as a feed roll 
of unstretched film. Film is customarily drawn from the roll and applied to 
the object by securing an end of the film to the object, and then either 
rotating the object or orbiting the feed roll around the object. A number of 
types of pre-stretching mechanisms have been proposed hitherto whereby 
the web of film extending from the feed roll to the object is stretched as it is 
drawn from the roll before being applied to the object. Such pre-stretching of the film is advantageous for a number of 
reasons, for example;  
 
   the pre-stretched film may be applied to the object under a relatively 
low lay-up tension, as the subsequent contraction of the film ensures a 
desirably tight wrap (this is particularly advantageous when an assemblage 
of relatively small or lightweight articles is to be wrapped, because it 
reduces the likelihood of the articles being displaced by the wrapping 
process), 
   moderate or properly controlled pre-stretching improves the 
mechanical properties of the film, and 
   it is economical, in that a given weight of film may be extended to 
provide effectively more wrapping material. The simplest and least desirable prior known pre-stretching 
apparatus merely applies a brake to the roll of film. Such apparatus is 
disclosed, for example, in US patent 3,867,806 (Lancaster) and US patent 
4,077,179 (Lancaster). In these and other instances wherein a brake is 
applied to the feed roll, the stretching is induced by using a high lay-up 
tension. This suffers from the disadvantages inherent in the use of a high 
lay-up tension indicated above. Furthermore, stretching occurs throughout 
the whole length of the flight of web extending from the feed roll to the 
object, so that the overall increase in

A pre-stretching mechanism for use in a wrapping apparatus in which 
a web (6) of plastics film is drawn from a feed roll (5) of film and applied to an 

object to be wrapped by virtue of relative rotational movement between the 
object and the roll (5), the pre-stretching mechanism including: 


a supporting chassis (4), 
a braking roller (9) mounted on the chassis (4) for rotation about an 
axis that is fixed relative to the chassis (4), 
a stretching roller (7) mounted on the chassis (4) for rotation about an 
axis which is fixed relative to the chassis (4), parallel to the braking roller axis 

and spaced therefrom, 
drive transmission means (10,11,12) connecting the stretching (7) and 
braking (9) rollers such that the surface speed of the stretching roller (7) 

exceeds that of the braking roller (9), and
 
   mandrel means (14) for the rotational support of the feed roll (5) 

mounted on the chassis (4), and whereby the web (6) is drawn directly from the feed roll (5) 
around the stretching roller (7), 
 
   
characterised in that
 
   guide means (15,16,17) mount the mandrel means (14) on the chassis 

(4) allowing the mandrel means (14) to move freely towards the braking roller 
(9) under the influence, in use, of tension in the web (6) drawn directly from 

the feed roll (5) and passing around the stretching roller (7), and
 
   supplementary loading means (18) acts independently of the web 

tension and supplements the web tension in urging the feed roll (5) towards 
the braking roller (9) to maintain braking contact therebetween and thereby 

cause stretching in the web (6) of film between the feed roll (5) and the 
stretching roller (7). 
A pre-stretching mechanism according to claim 1, wherein the guide 
means (15,16,17) comprise two slideable saddles (16) respectively supporting  

 
ends of the mandrel means (14), and the supplementary loading means (18) 

comprise springs (18) acting between the saddles (16) and the shuttle (4).

(16) are movable along guide rods (17) and each of the springs (18) is 

sleeved upon a respective guide rod (17).

claims, wherein the braking roller (9) is surfaced with a soft elastomeric 

material. 
A pre-stretching mechanism according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the supplementary loading means (18) are such that the

attaching an end of the film to the at least part of the object, causing the 
shuttle (4) to orbit the at least part of the object and to pre-stretch the film as 

it is drawn from the feed roll (5) by the relative movement between the object 
and the shuttle (4) prior to its application to the object,
 
   
characterised in that
 the feed roll (5) is free to move bodily into contact 
with a braking roller (9) under the effect of tension in the film departing from

the feed roll (5) around a stretching roller (7) connected to the braking roller 
(9) by drive transmission means (10,11,12) ensuring that the surface speed 

of the stretching roller (7) is greater than that of the braking roller (9), and

is independent of the film tension. 
A method according to claim 7, wherein the supplementary force has 
a magnitude such that the maximum pressure obtained between the braking 

roller (9) and the feed roll (5) is such that slippage between the braking roller 
(9) and feed roll (5) occurs prior to the web tension reaching breaking point.
