<ABSTRACT>
Trimethylolpropane of high purity is efficiently made by mixing the aldol reaction product of formaldehyde and n-butyraldehyde with at least about 20 wt % of a lower alcohol prior to hydrogenation to allow recovery of high purity product by simple distillation. In a less preferred mode, the alcohol may be added after hydrogenation, resulting in a smaller improvement over previous processes.

 MANUFACTURE OF TRIMETHYLOLPROPANE
Technical Field
 This invention relates to the production of trimethylolpropane and particularly to conducting the hydrogenation of the reaction product of n-butyraldehyde (NBAL) and formaldehyde in the presence of at least 20% of a lower alcohol of the formula R1R2CHOH where   R    and R2 are independently hydrogen or alkyl groups having 1 to about 5 carbon atoms but together have no more than 6 carbon atoms.


Background of the Invention
 The conventional production of trimethylolpropane typically entails the reaction of n-butyraldehyde and formaldehyde (usually an aqueous solution) to obtain the aldol reaction product which may then be hydrogenated over a hydrogenation catalyst either with or without treatment intended to purify it. Representative of the prior art are
U.S. Patents 4,122,290 and 4,514,578 to Immel et al and 4,594,461 to Merger et al, which may use a trialkyl-amine catalyst in the aldol step. While the conventional commercial processes have served more or less satisfactorily in the context of the state of the art, our process is much more efficient and the product is much more pure.


 Commercially, formaldehyde is available in either of two forms, paraformaldehyde or as an  aqueous solution (referred to herein as aqueous formaldehyde). Paraformaldehyde is a crystalline solid consisting of a linear polymeric form of formaldehyde of the molecular formula, HO(CH2)nH where n = 8-100. Aqueous formaldehyde consists predominently as formaldehyde in its monomeric form.


On standing, it will gradually react with itself forming oligomeric formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde. This is commonly inhibited by adding up to 15% methanol as a stabilizer. Where "formaldehyde" is used hereafter, we mean that either formaldehyde in the form of paraformaldehyde or aqueous formaldehyde is acceptable unless otherwise specified.


 Klein, in U.S. Patent 3,076,854, treats a crude trimethylolpropane by solvent extracting with an alcohol such as amyl alcohol, re-extracting with water, heating with methanol in the presence of a strong acid, and passing through an ion exchange bed to remove metals. Purification was not accomplished by distillation as in the present invention.


 In East German Patent 142,184, Dietze et al follow a more or less conventional TMP preparation by distillation to obtain a distillation bottoms comprising about 3% of the reaction product; this bottoms portion is treated with methanol and passed through a strong acid resin to liberate additional TMP.
