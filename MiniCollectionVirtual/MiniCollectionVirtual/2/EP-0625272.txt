<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a method of producing a cover for an integrated optical circuit, and the cover and circuit thus produced. The method enables the design complexity necessary for the integration of optical components into fibre-optic systems to be minimized. This is done by placing an optical component (1) on a die (2) on which the component (1) is automatically aligned. The optical component (1) and the die (2) are embedded in a curable liquid which, on solidification, forms the cover (13).

Method for producing an integrated optical
circuit from a substrate with an integrated optical

waveguide and a cover, characterized by the following
method steps:


a) provision of an optical component which has, in its
surface, V-shaped grooves (3) and an active zone,
b) provision of a mould punch (2) which has at least one
prism-shaped guiding lug (4) and at least one further

prism-shaped elevation (12), which is designed in such a
way that it can engage in one of the V-grooves (3),
c) emplacement of the optical component onto the mould
punch, in such a way that the prism-shaped elevation (12)

engages in the V-groove (3),

the guiding lug (4) and the prism-shaped elevation (12)
of the mould punch being designed in such a way that the

active zone of the component (1) is aligned with the
guiding lug (4) after emplacement,


d) casting of a curable compound around the optical
component, the cover of the integrated optical circuit

being produced,
e) release of the cover (13) from the mould punch,
f) emplacement of the cover (13) onto the substrate,
which has grooves for receiving optical waveguides, in

such a way that the cutouts (11), which are produced in
the cover by the impression of the guiding lugs (4), can,

in interaction with the accommodating grooves in the
substrate, accommodate an optical fibre, and
g) adhesive bonding of substrate and cover (13).
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the mould punch (2) is provided with at least one 

alignment device (6), and in that, during insertion, the
optical component (1) is aligned on one side by the

alignment device (6).
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the mould punch is provided with two alignment

devices (6), and in that the optical component (1) is
centred, during insertion, on opposite sides by the

alignment devices (6).
Method according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that those sides of the alignment devices (6) which

face the optical component (1) are bevelled, and in that
the corresponding side faces of the optical component (1)

are at least partially bevelled.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the mould punch (2) is provided with

load-relieving lugs (5), by means of which the pressure
which is applied to the optical component (1) during

emplacement of the optical component (1) is taken up.
