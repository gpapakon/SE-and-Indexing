<ABSTRACT>
Device and method for sleeving an inside surface 
(40) of a tube (30), which tube may be a heat transfer tube 

of the kind typically found in nuclear steam generators. 
The device comprises a sleeve (230) having a wall (310) 

forming a compact spiral-shaped transverse cross section 
defining a first position of the sleeve. The wall in its 

first position surrounds an expandable bladder (240) 
supported by a support body (360). The support body, 

bladder and sleeve are inserted into the tube and translated 
along the inside surface thereof to the region of the 

tube to be sleeved. The compact spiral-shape of the wall 
in its first position allows it to pass unimpeded through 

the inside diameter of a previously installed sleeve that 
may be disposed in the tube, so that the previously installed 

sleeve does not interfere with the translation of 
the sleeve along the inside surface of the tube. Connected 

to the bladder is a pressurizer (250) for pressurizing the 
bladder so that the bladder expands to expand the wall of 

the sleeve (after it passes through the inside diameter of 
the previously installed sleeve) from the first position to 

a second position wherein the wall forms an annular transverse 
cross section. A fluid reservoir (260) is in fluid 

communication with the pressurizer for supplying fluid to 
the pressurizer which in turn pressuri
zes the fluid and 
supplies the pressurized fluid to the bladder to pressurize 

and expand the bladder. As the bladder expands, the wall 
moves from its first position to its second position and 

intimately engages the inside surface of the tube for 
sleeving the tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to tube sleeves 
and methods of installing same and more particularly 
relates to a device and method for sleeving an inside 
surface of a tubular member, which tubular member may be a 
heat transfer tube of the kind typically found in nuclear 
steam generators. A nuclear steam generator is a device for producing 
steam by circulation of a pressurized and radioactive 
first fluid, referred to as the primary fluid, through a 
plurality of leak-tight tubes that are surrounded by a 
nonradioactive second fluid of lower temperature, referred 
to as the secondary fluid. Each tube passes through holes 
in a plurality of spaced-apart support plates for laterally 
supporting the tubes. The tubes have an inverted U-shape, 
the opposite ends of which pass through openings in a 
tubesheet disposed in the steam generator, the tube ends 
being welded to the tubesheet for axially supporting the 
tubes. The tube ends are in fluid communication with a 
plenum defined by the steam generator, the plenum being 
divided by means of a divider plate into an inlet chamber 
and an outlet chamber. The inlet and outlet chambers are 
in communication with the primary fluid by means of an 
inlet nozzle and an outlet nozzle, respectively, for 
circulating the primary fluid through the tubes. The 
secondary fluid, which surrounds the tubes, is vaporized 
into steam as the heat of the circulating primary fluid is  
 
conducted through the walls of the tubes to the secondary 
fluid. The steam flows to a turbine-generator for providing 
revenue-producing electricity in a manner well known in 
the art of power generation. The secondary and/or primary fluid, however, may 
contain suspended corrosive particles such as metal oxides 
and scale-forming calcium. These corrosive deposits may 
occasionally degrade the tubes. Such degradation, which 
may preferentially occur at the tubesheet and support plate 
regions, may increase the risk that the tubes will experience 
a phenomenon known in the art as stress corrosion 
cracking. This stress corrosion cracking in turn may lead 
to through-wall cracks in the tubes that may compromise the 
ability of the tubes to remain leak-tight. Inability of 
the tubes to remain leak-tight may allow the pressurized 
and radioactive primary fluid to leak through the cracks 
and commingle with the nonradioactive secondary fluid. 
Leaking tubes are undesirable because commingling the 
radioactive primary fluid with the nonradioactive secondary 
fluid radioactively contaminates

A device for sleeving an inside surface (40) 
of a tube (30), characterized by a sleeve (230) adapted to 

intimately engage the inside surface of the tube, said
