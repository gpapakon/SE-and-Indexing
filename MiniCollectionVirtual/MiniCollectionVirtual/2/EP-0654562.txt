<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a bridge stay consisting of a cable (1), itself wrapped into a discontinuous covering composed of successive identical tubular segments (4) with mutually interlocked (at 9) ends. This stay comprises an inextensible line (10) stretched along the cable, inside the successive covering segments, which line is solidly attached to a plurality of equidistant fasteners (11), of which there are the same number as the said covering segments, each fastener being fixed to one covering segment as a point on this segment and the distance (D) between any two successive fasteners attached to the line being equal to the distance between two identical points and two successive covering segments, which distance is slightly less than the minimum admissible length for each segment.
