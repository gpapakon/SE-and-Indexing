<ABSTRACT>
In the storage case, the positions of rotation 
preventive projections 67 on the casing side opposing wall 65 

of a casing part 62 are respectively set in common areas shared 
in common by forward loading areas corresponding to the 

positions of the hubs when the tape cassette 2 is loaded onto 
a cover part 61 forwardly and by reverse loading areas 

corresponding to the hub positions when the tape cassette 2 is 
loaded onto the cover part 62 reversely, and the rotation 

preventive projections 67 respectively include securing grooves 
71 into which hub claws 23 provided on the inner periphery of 

the hubs 22 can be fitted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a case for a magnetic
tape cassette and, in particular, to an improved case for a
magnetic tape cassette which is used to keep a magnetic tape
cassette for audio.Conventionally, a magnetic tape cassette used for audio
and the like (which will be hereinafter referred to simply as
a tape cassette) includes a front opening portion into which a
magnetic head or the like is inserted when the tape cassette is
loaded into recording/reproducing apparatus or the like, and
also a magnetic tape so mounted as to cross the front opening
portion. Therefore, in order to prevent dust from getting into
the tape cassette through front opening portion as well as to
protect the magnetic tape exposed to the front opening portion
and the whole tape cassette, the tape cassette is ordinarily
stored in a case for a magnetic tape cassette (which will
hereinafter be referred to simply as a storage case) for
storage.In Fig. 8, there is shown a conventional storage case.
In this figure, a storage case 1 includes a cover part 11 and
a casing part 12 which is connected to the cover part 11
openably and closably. And the cover part 11 includes a cover
side opposing wall 13 to extend along one surface of a tape
cassette 2 and a pocket 14 which is disposed in one end side of
the cover side opposing wall 13 and into which the front 
opening portion 21 of the tape cassette 2 can be inserted. As
shown in Fig. 8, in the storage case, an index card 3 and tape
cassette 2 can be inserted into and removed from the pocket 14
along the cover side opposing wall 13.On the other hand, the casing part 12 includes a casing
side opposing wall 15 for covering the other surface of the
tape cassette 2 loaded on the cover part 11, two pivotally
mounting portions 16 for connecting the casing side opposing
wall 15 to the cover part 11 rotatably, and a pair of rotation
preventive projections 17 projectingly provided on the casing
side opposing wall 15.Here, the pivotally mounting portions 16 include, for
example, two shaft-like projections so provided in the inner
portions of the casing part 12 as to be fittable into two
bearing holes respectively formed in the two side walls of the
pocket 14 of the cover part 11, so that the cover part 11 and
casing part 12 can be rotatably connected to each other. And,
referring to the rotation preventive projections 17, when the
cover part 11 or casing part 12 is rotated about the pivotally
mounting portions 16 to close the casing side opposing wall 15
with respect to the cover part 11, the

<CLAIMS>
A case (6) for a magnetic tape cassette (2) comprising a
cover part (61) including a cover side opposing wall (63) to extend along

one surface of a magnetic tape cassette (2) and a pocket (64) disposed
at one end side of the cover side opposing wall (63) to be able to

store one end portion of the magnetic tape cassette, and a
casing part (62) including a casing side opposing wall (65) facing the

cover side opposing wall (63), and rotation preventive projections (67)
provided on the casing side opposing wall (65) and engageable with

hubs (22) provided in the magnetic tape cassette (2) for securing the
hubs (22), said casing part (62) being pivotally mounted to the cover

part (61) openably and closably, wherein the positions of said
rotation preventive projections (67) are respectively set in the

common areas (4) of said hubs (23) shared in common when said magnetic
tape cassette (2) is loaded forwardly and reversely, and said

rotation preventive projections (67) are respectively arranged in a
shape which, as a whole, is gradually enlarged in diameter from

the leading end side thereof toward the base portion side
thereof, characterized in that said rotation preventive projections (67) respectively include securing grooves (71, 72) into which

hub claws (23) projectingly provided on the inner peripheries of
said hubs (22) can be fitted. 
A case (6) for a magnetic tape cassette (2) according to
claim 1, wherein said rotation preventive projections

(67) are formed with a shape such as a transverse
section intersecting substantially perpendicular to the

projection direction of the rotation preventive
projections (67) has a shape similar to the outline of

the common area (4).
A case (6) for a magnetic tape cassette (2) as set forth
in claim 1 or 2, wherein said securing grooves (71) of

said rotation preventive projections each include at the
upper end side thereof an inclined surface (73) for

inviting said hub claw (22) into said securing groove
(71).
A case (6) for a magnetic tape cassette (2) according to
one of the claims 1-3, wherein said securing grooves

(71) have a groove width (W3) which is set slightly
larger than the diameter dimension (D1) of the hub claw

(23), the difference between the groove width (W3) and
the diameter dimension (D1) in particular being within a

range of 0.1 to 0.5 mm.
A case (6) for a magnetic tape cassette (2) as set forth
in one of claims 1-4, wherein said rotation preventive

projections (67) each comprise a pair of escape grooves
(72) being arranged for accommodating the hub claws (23)

adjoining the hub claw (23) projecting into the securing
groove (71). 
A case (6) for a magnetic tape cassette (2) as set forth
in one of the claims 1 to 5, wherein said casing and

said cover parts (61, 62) respectively include recessed
portions (81, 82, 83) for receiving the increased

thickness portion (25) of said tape cassette (2) in
order to allow both forward and reverse loading of said

magnetic tape cassette (2) and said recessed portions
(81, 82, 83) enable said case to be structured in a thin

case.
A case (6) for a magnetic tape cassette (2) as set forth
in claim 6, wherein said recessed portion (81) is formed

as a single rectangular recessed portion being adapted
to accommodate the increased thickness portion (25)

either in a forward loading position of the tape
cassette (2) or in a reverse loading position of the

tape cassette (2).
A case (6) for a magnetic tape cassette (2) as set forth
in claim 7, wherein said case (6) further comprises an

index card (7), the dimensions (W6, W4) of which being
selected slightly smaller than the dimensions of the

recessed portion (81), said index card (7) being secured
by means of a stepped portion (85) provided at an edge

portion of the recessed portion (81).
