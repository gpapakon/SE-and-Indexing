<ABSTRACT>
With the aid of the device according to the invention, water can be revitalised by at least one solid crystal increasing the energy content of the water being arranged in the water stream made turbulent by a stirrer or a pump, which solid crystal is a precious stone, semiprecious stone, rock crystal or a globulite. Vortexing the water in combination with crystals can also be performed in valve fittings through which the flow passes. To treat relatively large amounts of water, successive connection of a plurality of reaction chambers in a multistage pump or series connection of a plurality of pumps having reaction chambers arranged in between is expedient.
