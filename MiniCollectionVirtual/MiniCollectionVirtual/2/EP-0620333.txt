<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a planar double-walled composite profile formed from extruded profiles, the composite profile comprising at least two profiles (1), which exhibit an upper flange and a lower flange (2 and 3) which are spaced apart by a web (4) and exhibit groove mouldings and tongue mouldings (5 and 6). In order to simplify the production and joining-together of the profiles (1) which form the composite profile and in order to achieve a reduction in the weight of the composite profile per unit of surface area, the interconnectable profiles (1) are of identical design and each profile (1) exhibits merely one tongue moulding (6) and one groove moulding (5), which is arranged approximately in the longitudinal centre plane of the profile (1), in the corner region between upper flange (2) and web (4). The lower flange (3) exhibits, in the corner region between the lower flange (3) and web (4), a stepped shoulder (7) into which the adjacent profile (1) engages and fixes the lower flanges (3) of two adjacent profiles (1) with respect to one another.
