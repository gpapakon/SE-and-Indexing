<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a blanket (10) for use with forced air convection systems, wherein the blanket includes multiple inlet ports (30, 40). By providing a blanket (10) with multiple inlet ports (30, 40), the user has the choice of positioning the air supply or blower unit and the supply hose on either side of the patient. In addition, in a preferred embodiment, the inlet ports are resealable, thus allowing the user to switch inlets during use.

<DESCRIPTION>
Hypothermia is a condition of subnormal body
temperature and presents serious consequences to the
patient suffering therefrom. It has been shown that nearly
seventy five percent of all patients who undergo surgical
procedures develop hypothermia. This equates to
approximately fourteen million patients a year in the
United States alone. The hypothermic condition is brought
on by many factors including anesthesia, the air
conditioning of the operating room, and the infusion of
cold blood, I-V solutions, or irrigating fluids.Several methods and products have been developed to
help prevent hypothermia from occurring; such as the use of
infrared lamps, cotton blankets, and warm water mattresses.
However, none of these methods and products have proven
completely successful. In fact, it has been shown that
these methods and products can not even prevent the
patients from losing their endogenous heat. (See Journal
of Post Anesthesia Nursing, Vol. 5, No. 4, August 1990, pp
254-263).Another method of helping to prevent hypothermia that
has proven very effective is the use of forced warm air
convection. As early as 1937, a refrigeration blanket
using cold air convection was suggested in US patent
2,093,834 to Gaugler. This blanket included a plurality of
layers for channeling air flow from an inlet port. Non-inflatable
portions were provided around the periphery of
the blanket to secure the blanket around the body.US patent 2,512,559 to Williams also relates to a 
blanket for providing cooled air to a person. The blanket
in Williams comprised a plurality of thin sheets of
material connected together at a plurality of discrete
locations and connected together in a continuous line about
the peripheral edge. An air inlet was provided to
communicate with space between the sheets to allow cool air
to be supplied thereto.In US patent 4,572,188 to Augustine et al, a forced
air convection system which can supply either cool or warm
air to a blanket is described. The blanket in Augustine et
al comprises a plurality of inflatable hollow tubes having
their interiors connected together through transverse
openings. An entry port is provided in the upper surface
of the blanket for admitting the cool or warm air and small
exit ports are provided through the lower surface to allow
the cool or warm air to flow out toward a body covered by
the blanket.Other patents relating to the supply of cool or warm
air to a person through an inflatable blanket include US
patents 4,660,388 to Greene, Jr.; 4,777,802 to Feher; and
4,867,230 to

<CLAIMS>
A forced warm air convection patient warming system, comprising an inflatable blanket (10)
for a patient's body, the blanket (10) having a single upper surface and a single lower surface, the

single upper surface being entirely formed of an upper continuous sheet of material and the
single lower surface being entirely formed of a lower continuous sheet of material, the upper

and lower continuous sheets of material being sealed together along their peripheral edges and
welded directly together at a plurality of discrete interior locations (50) on interior surface portions

of the two sheets of material so as to form said inflatable blanket having an inflatable interior
portion, said blanket permitting air to escape from said blanket toward the patient's body,

characterised in that said inflatable blanket has a head recess portion (20) adapted for positioning toward a
patient's head, and that said blanket has at least two inlet ports (30, 40) in communication with said inflatable

interior portion, the ports being positioned about said head recess portion (20) of said blanket so that,
in use, one said inlet port is positioned on one side of a patient's head and another of said inlet

ports is positioned on another side of said patient's head,
wherein each inlet port is initially sealed closed,

and wherein the inlet ports are selectively openable by seals selected from the group consisting
of tear strips, velcro strips, adhesive strips, double-sided tapes, snaps, zippers, flaps, and

ziploc type seals.
The patient warming system of claim 1 wherein said blanket has only two said inlet ports.
The patient warming system of claim 1 wherein said inlet ports are non-reversibly sealed.
The patient warming system of claim 1 wherein each of said seals comprises a tear strip.
The patient warming system of claim 1 wherein each of said seals comprises a flap.
The patient warming system of claim 1 wherein said seals comprise velcro strips.
