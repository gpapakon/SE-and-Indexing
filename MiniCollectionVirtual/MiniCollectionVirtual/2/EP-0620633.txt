<ABSTRACT>
In a motor having a spindle (5) on which an inner race (8) 
of a ball bearing is mounted, an outer peripheral surface 

of an end of the spindle (5) is formed into a knurled 
portion (16) on which is mounted the inner race (8) which 

is fixed to the spindle (5) through an adhesive (18) 
filling a clearance between an inner surface of the inner 

race (8) and the knurled portion (16). An annular groove 
(19), formed in the spindle (5) in an area adjacent to the 

knurled portion (16), is also filled with the adhesive (18) 
to further fix the inner race (8) to the spindle (5), which 

improves the adhesive bond between the inner race (8) and 
the spindle (5). Even where the ball bearing is a 

miniature one having a thin-wall inner race (8), there is 

no risk of deformation of the inner race (8) when the 
adhesive (18) is cured, and so the rotational accuracy of 

the motor is improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
THE PRESENT INVENTION relates to a machine having a spindle 
received in a bore of a component thereby fixed to the 
spindle. The invention is of particular, but not 
exclusive, utility to the securing of the inner races of 
rolling element bearings, such as ball or roller bearings, 
to motor spindles, for example in motors employed in office 
equipment. It is known for an inner race of a ball bearing to 
be fixedly mounted on a spindle of a motor by means 
including a suitable adhesive, as described below by 
reference to Figures 5(a) and 5(b) of the accompanying 
drawings. Thus, 
(a) As shown in Figure 5(a), an annular groove, 
which is formed between a chamfered outer end portion of 
the motor spindle and a corresponding chamfered inner end 
portion of the inner race of the ball bearing, whereby the 
groove has a V-shaped form in cross section, is filled with 
the adhesive which is permitted to flow into an annular 
clearance formed between an outer peripheral surface of the 
spindle and an inner peripheral surface of the inner race 
of the ball bearing. The adhesive is allowed to cure in 
such annular clearance so as to fix the inner race of the 
ball bearing to the spindle of the motor. However, this 
first approach is not reliable, because the adhesive 
supplied to the annular groove often does not flow well 
enough into the annular clearance formed between the 
spindle and the inner race of the ball bearing to provide 
an adequate adhesive bond therebetween.  
 (b) As shown in Figure 5(b) in an attempt to 
overcome this difficulty it is known to reduce the diameter 
of the spindle over an end portion thereof to form a 
relatively large annular clearance between the outer 
peripheral surface of the reduced-diameter portion of the 
spindle and the inner peripheral surface of the inner race 
of the ball bearing. As a result, the adhesive supplied to 
the V-section annular groove formed at the end of the 
spindle/inner race combination can flow readily into this 
relatively large annular clearance and can be cured therein 
subsequently so as to fix the inner race of the ball 
bearing to the spindle of the motor. In a motor of a normal size, this second approach 
is adequate, because the annular clearance formed between 
the inner race and the spindle can be sufficiently filled 
with the adhesive to provide a good adhesive bond 
therebetween. This second approach cannot be used, however, to 
secure the inner race of a miniature ball bearing to the 
spindle of a miniature motor, because it has been
