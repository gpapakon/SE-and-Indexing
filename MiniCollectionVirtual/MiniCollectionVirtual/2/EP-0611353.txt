<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a 
device for easily and quickly locking and releasing a 
flexible rope in an adjusted position in relation to an 
anchor point which is more reliable and secure than 
forming knots in the rope with adjustment or tensioning 
of the rope being accomplished with the present device 
much quicker than tieing knots. The adjustable rope 
lock of the present invention enables the rope to be 
easily secured in or released from adjusted position by 
the use of a single hand thus greatly facilitating the 
use of this device in adjustably securing ropes in 
various use environments. The adjustable rope lock includes a body of 
material having converging passageways extending 
therethrough with the passageways terminating at one 
edge of the body in a joined, merged passageway and 
terminating at an opposite edge of the body in spaced 
relation with the rope being threaded through the  
 
passageways with the two ends of the rope extending 
outwardly from the merged passageway at one edge of the 
body. The merged passage-way from which the free ends 
of the rope extend is generally elliptical in shape 
although the specific configuration can vary with the 
ropes being positioned one above the other with one 
rope supporting a load and forming a taut rope segment. 
The other rope is the adjustable rope and forms a pull 
rope segment which may be pulled freely to take up 
slack, maintain or increase tension. Various devices have been provided which 
enable a rope to be adjustably connected to an anchor 
point. However, such devices include various types of 
clamp devices, hooks, brackets, cleats and the like 
which require that the rope be wrapped around or tied 
into a knot to adjustably connect the rope to an anchor 
point. The following U.S. patents relate to rope 
anchoring devices.

adjustably connecting a rope to an anchor point, the 
prior art does not disclose the specific structure of  
 
the present invention in which a load or taut rope 
segment can be adjusted in relation to a body by 
manipulating a pull rope segment in a linear direction. 
Further, the prior art does not disclose the various 
specific structural modifications of the present 
invention all of which include a specific passageway 
arrangement in a body which receives the adjustable 
rope therethrough with the passageways being of a 
particular configuration and arrangement to receive the 
rope
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A combination of a flexible rope and a rope lock comprising 
a body (12, 52, 82, 94, 122, 164, 202) having opposed surfaces 

(32, 36), means supporting said body from a supporting structure, 
said body including a pair of passageways (28, 30; 68, 70; 

124, 126; 204, 206) extending between and communicating with the 
opposite surfaces (32, 36), said passageways (28, 30; 68, 70; 

124, 126; 204, 206) having one of their ends in spaced relation 
in one (32) of said opposed surfaces, the other ends of said 

passageways merging and joining into a single, generally elliptically 
shaped opening (38) in the other (36) of said surfaces, 

said flexible rope extending through said passageways (28, 30; 
68, 70; 124, 126; 204, 206) with the free ends of the rope 

exiting from the generally elliptical opening (38) with one of 
the rope segments (40, 42; 72, 74; 106, 108; 128, 130; 174, 176; 

208, 210) being above the other as they exit from the generally 
elliptical opening (38) with the upper rope segment (40, 72, 

106, 128, 174, 208) being taut and the lower rope segment (42, 
74, 108, 130, 176, 210) being loose to form a pull rope segment 

whereby the taut rope segment (40, 72, 106, 128, 208) will bear 
against and frictionally lock the pull rope segment (42, 74, 

108, 130, 176, 210) against linear movement into the generally 
elliptical opening (38) when the taut rope segment (40, 72, 106, 

128, 174, 208) is oriented in an angular position extending 
outwardly and downwardly from the body (12, 52, 82, 94, 122, 

164, 202) with the pull rope segment (42, 74, 108, 130, 176, 
210) being movable outwardly in a linear direction when the 

adjustable rope segment (42, 74, 108, 130, 176, 210) is located 
below the taut rope segment (40, 72, 106, 128, 174, 208).  

 
The combination as defined in claim 1 wherein said means on 
the body (12) for engaging a supporting structure includes a 

bracket plate (14) adapted to be mounted on a boat, said body 
(12) being detachably connected to the bracket plate (14) with
