<ABSTRACT>
In knitting a desired knit fabric (5), first of all, 
knitting needles of one of a pair of needle beds in a range 

corresponding with a knitting width of the desired knit 
fabric are fed with a draw yarn and a course of stitches is 

formed out of the draw yarn (4). Then, a part or all of the 
knitting needles used for knitting the draw yarn are fed 

with a knitting yarn and a course of stitches is formed out 
of the knitting yarn. Thereafter, the knitting needles of 

the front and the rear needle bed in the range corresponding 
with a knitting width of the desired knit fabric are fed 

with the knitting yarn and the initial portion of the 
desired fabric is knitted. Subsequently the knitting 

needles of either front or rear needle bed are fed with the 
knitting yarn and thereafter the knitting needles of another 

needle bed are fed with the knitting yarn and tubular plain 
stitches are knitted. Then knitting for obtaining the 

desired knit fabric is carried out. The draw yarn is drawn 
out of the knit fabric after the completion of the knitting. 

Next, a yarn end remaining at the initial portion is pulled 
out from the knit fabric, and the pulled-out yarn end is cut 

in a region near a side end of the knit fabric in a state 
that the initial portion is contracted. The cut end of the 

pulled-out yarn end is pulled back into the initial portion 
of the knit fabric by expanding the contracted initial  

 
portion in a direction wherein the contraction thereof is 

loosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of treating a
yarn end which presents in the knitting start portion
(hereinafter described as "initial portion") of a fabric
knitted by the use of a flat knitting machine.In the case of knitting with a flat knitting machine,
the following steps are usually taken at the beginning of
knitting. A knitting yarn is fed into a knitting region by
a yarn feeder for guiding the knitting yarn to knitting
needles on a needle bed in such a state that a yarn end of
the knitting yarn is held by a yarn end holder arranged
outside the knitting region in a lateral direction of the
needle bed on the top face of which a plurality of knitting
needles are implanted. Subsequently a suitable quantity of
courses are knitted. Thereafter the yarn end holded by the
yarn end holder is released and pulled down with the knitted
fabric in such a state that the yarn end is associated with
the initial portion of the knitted fabric. In the fabric
knitted in such manner, a portion of the knitting yarn which 
exists from the yarn end holded by the yarn end holder to
the position actually fed to the knitting needles is not
knitted into the knitted fabric, and becomes a yarn end
portion exposed outside the knitted fabric along the initial
portion.In the case of knitting an attachment piece to be sewn
together with a piece such as a collar or front body for the
purpose of reinforcement etc., the attachment pieces are
usually knitted by continuous knitting. The continuous
knitting means continuously knitting such attachment pieces
having a predetermined length one by one without cutting the
knitting yarn in a state that the respective attachment
pieces are connected with one another via a draw yarn. When
such continuous knitting is conducted, a yarn is left among
the knitted attachment pieces at an interval of a course
knitted by the draw yarn. After knitting the attachment
pieces is completed, the draw yarn connecting the attachment
pieces is cut and removed, and the yarn among the knitted
attachment pieces is cut in order to separate the respective
knitted attachment pieces from one another. As a result,
the cut yarn remains at the initial portion of each
attachment piece and exposed itself outside the knitted
attachment piece.In order to treat the yarn end remaining at the initial
portion of these knitted fabrics, the yarn end is 
conventionally pulled into the initial portion of each
knitted fabric using a crochet needle after the completion of
knitting with a knitting machine.In such a

Method of treating a yarn end of a knit fabric (1, 7)
knitted by the use of a flat knitting machine having at least

a pair of needle beds arranged in front and in rear, which can
be relatively moved in a longitudinal direction, the method

comprising the steps of:

feeding knitting needles of one of the pair of needle
beds in a range corresponding with a knitting width of a

desired knit fabric (1,7) with a draw yarn (4);
forming a portion knitted out of the draw yarn (4);
feeding at least a part of the knitting needles used
for knitting the draw yarn (4) with a knitting yarn (10);
forming a portion knitted out of a yarn end portion of
the knitting yarn;
feeding the knitting needles of the front and rear
needle beds in the range corresponding with a knitting width

of the desired knit fabric with the knitting yarn (10);
forming an initial portion of rib stitches (102, 105) of the knitting yarn;
knitting the desired knit fabric (5,9) and removing
the entire knitted fabric (1,7) from the flat knitting

machine;
drawing the draw yarn (4) from the portion knitted out
of the draw yarn (4);
pulling out the knitting yarn end (2,6) out of which a
knitted yarn end portion is formed from the knit fabric (5,9)

till the initial portion is put into a contracted state; 
cutting the pulled-out yarn end 92,6) in a region near
a side end of the knitted fabric (5,9);
expanding the contracted initial portion of the
knitted fabric (5,9); and
pulling back the yarn end (2) remaining at the initial
portion into the initial portion.
Method of treating a yarn end of a knit fabric
according to claim 1, characterized in that all of the

knitting needles used for knitting the draw yarn (4) are fed
with the knitting yarn (10) to form the knitted yarn end

portion.
Method of treating a yarn end of a knit fabric
