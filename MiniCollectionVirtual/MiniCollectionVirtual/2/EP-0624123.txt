<ABSTRACT>
Method for pressing a plastic (6), which cures by means of a reaction, from a displacement chamber (4) via at least one injection channel (3) and a gate (2) into a mould cavity (1), said method at least comprising the following steps: pressurising the plastic (6) with an amount of a pressing auxiliary (7) in the displacement chamber (4); pressing the plastic (6) into the mould cavity (1); and allowing the plastic to cure under pressure in the mould cavity, the pressing auxiliary (7) being plastically deformable under the conditions of pressing and the amount thereof being sufficient to be pressed to the vicinity of the gate (2) of the mould cavity (1). Preferably the pressing auxiliary (7) is a thermoplastic.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention firstly relates to a method 
for pressing a plastic, which cures by means of a 
reaction, from a displacement chamber via at least one 
injection channel and a gate into a mould cavity, said 
method at least comprising the following steps: 
pressurising the plastic with an amount of a 
pressing auxiliary in the displacement chamber; pressing the plastic into the mould cavity; and allowing the plastic to cure under pressure in the 
mould cavity,  
the amount of pressure auxiliary being sufficient to be 
pressed to the vicinity of the gate of the mould cavity. The term plastic which cures by means of a 
reaction is used to designate plastics such as, for 
example, thermosetting plastics and photopolymerisable 
plastics, multicomponent plastics and the like. These are 
plastics which cure by supplying heat or light or after 
mixing with a chemical compound. Examples of such plastics 
are generally known to those skilled in the art. The 
plastics which cure by means of moisture or air can also 
be mentioned in this context. Usually however 
thermosetting plastics are used. The abovementioned method is generally known 
and is used for the production of diverse mouldings from 
plastics which cure by means of a reaction. The encapsulation 
of integrated circuits in thermosetting plastics, 
and the production of car components from such plastics, 
can, for example, be considered in this context. In this respect reference is made to 
US-A-3 911 075. In said specification a method is 
described, in which method a first thermosetting 
polymeric material is used as the plastic which cures by  
 
means of a reaction. Further a cheap second thermosetting 
polymeric material is used as the pressing auxiliary. By pressing 
the two polymeric materials together from a displacement chamber, 
through an injection channel and a gate into a mould cavity, 
the passages up to the gate are filled with the relatively cheap 
thermosetting polymeric material. Reference is also made to JP-A-59151436 which discloses 
a similar method in which a cheap multipurpose epoxy resin 
(thermosetting) is used as a pressing auxiliary. Pressing of plastics which cure by means of a reaction 
into a mould cavity is, as a consequence of the properties of 
these plastics, usually a batchwise method, because the curing 
reaction is frequently exothermic and is a reaction which goes 
to completion. For example, thermosetting plastics are plastics 
which melt by supplying heat thereto and then cure by means 
of an exothermic

Method for pressing a plastic (6; 9; 14; 16, 17), 
which cures by means of a reaction, from a displacement chamber 

(4) via at least one injection channel (3) and a gate (2) into 
a mould cavity (1), said method at least comprising the following 

steps: 

pressurising the plastic (6; 9; 14; 16, 17) with an amount 
of a pressing auxiliary (7; 8; 10, 11, 12; 13, 15; 18) 

in the displacement chamber (4); 
pressing the plastic (6; 9; 14; 16, 17) into the mould 
cavity (1); and 
allowing the plastic (6; 9; 14; 16, 17) to cure under 
pressure in the mould cavity (1),

18) being sufficient to be pressed to the vicinity of the gate 
(2) of the mould cavity (1), characterised in that as the 

pressing auxiliary (7; 8; 10, 11, 12; 13, 15; 18) a material 
is used, which is plastically deformable under the conditions 

of pressing and reversibly coagulates or hardens after pressing. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
under the conditions of pressing, the pressing auxiliary (7; 

8; 10, 11, 12; 13, 15; 18) has a higher viscosity than the 
plastic (6; 9; 14; 16, 17) which cures by means of a reaction.

12; 13, 15; 18) is made in the form of a holder (10; 13) for 
the plastic (6; 9; 14; 16, 17) which cures by means of a 

reaction, which holder (10; 13) can be processed after filling
