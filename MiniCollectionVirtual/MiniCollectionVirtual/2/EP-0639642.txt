<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a novel class of plant 
chitinases, which have endo-chitinase activity, antifungal activity and a 

molecular weight of about 40 to 43 kDa as judged by Sodium Dodecyl 
Sulphate Polyacrylamide electrophoresis. The invention further provides 

antifungal compositions comprising as active ingredient a chitinase 
according to the invention. According to a different aspect of the 

invention a isolated DNA sequence is provided which comprises an open 
reading frame encoding a novel chitinase. The invention also encompasses 

a plant expressible recombinant DNA sequence which comprises a DNA 
sequence encoding a chitinase according to the invention, as well as 

plant cells and plants which have such recombinant DNA incorporated into 
their genome.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to chitinases from plant 
origin, DNA coding therefor, and plants which have been 
transformed to contain and express said recombinant polynucleotides 
to produce or overproduce said chitinase. The 
invention further provides methods to protect plants from 
pathogen attack, as well as plants obtainable thereby. The 
invention further comprises antipathogenic compositions 
containing as active ingredient a chitinase according to the 
invention. Plants react to stresses such as attack by pathogens, 
chemical treatment and wounding, by accumulating a large 
number of proteins. One of the best studied plant responses 
is the induced expression of so-called pathogenesis-related 
proteins, PR-proteins, (Bowles, D. 1990, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 
59, 873-907); Linthorst, H.J.M., 1991, Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 
10, 123-150). PR-proteins can be classified into at least five families 
(PR-1 to PR-5) based on structure and/or activity. In 
tobacco, within each family of PR-proteins both intracellular 
(class-I) and extracellular (Class-II) isoforms are distinguished. Among the PR-proteins are chitinases, which constitute 
the PR-3 family (Legrand M., etal., 1987, Proc. Natl. Acad. 
Sci. USA, 84, 6750-6754). The class-I chitinases possess 
antifungal activity (Broekaert W.F. etal., 1988, Physiol. 
Mol. Plant Pathol. 33, 319-331), especially in combination 
with β-1,3-glucanase (Schlumbaum A. etal., 1986, Nature 324, 
365-367), classified as the PR-2 family (Kauffmann S. etal, 
1987, EMBO J. 6, 3209-3212). The occurrence of chitinases and the cloning of their 
corresponding cDNAs has been described for a large number of 
plant species, both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous 
species (for a recent review, vide Collinge D.B. etal., 
1993, The Plant Journal 3(1), 31-40). Chitinases are classified 
according to their primary structure into three classes  
 
(Shinshi H. etal, 1990, plant Mol. Biol. 14, 357-368). 
Recently chitinases have been found that do not fit into this 
classification: these chitinases have been proposed to form 
class-IV. The class I chitinases are characterised by the 
presence of an approximately 40 amino acid cysteine rich 
domain. The class-II chitinases resemble the class-I chitinases, 
inter alia by their amino acid sequence homology, but 
the former lack a cystein-rich domain. The class-III chitinases do not share sequence similarity 
with chitinases of either of the classes I or II. The 
class-IV chitinases, as proposed by Collinge etal. supra, 
comprise dugar beet
