<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous autodeposition coating composition that is essentially free of chromium compounds and which produces a film with a much better adherence and corrosion resistance than heretofore obtained, but which does so without a rinse treatment with a chromium-containing solution prior to film curing. The aqueous autodeposition coating composition has a pH of about 1.6 to about 5 and contains (i) water-dispersable or water-soluble organic film-forming resin; (ii) at least one of fluoride ions and fluoride ions and complex fluoride ions; (iii) ions of at least one metal selected from zinc, colbat, manganese, nickel, iron, and aluminum; and (iv) tungstate ion and/or molybdate ion.

<DESCRIPTION>
_Â»AUTODEPOSITION COATING COMPOSITION FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe invention relates to an aqueous autodeposition coating composition in the form of an acidic coating 5 composition (pH approximately 1.6 to 5) that contains a water-dispersible or water-soluble organic film-forming resin; fluoride ions or fluoride ions and" complex fluoride ions; one or more ions selected from ions of the following metals: zinc, cobalt, manganese, nickel, iron, and10 aluminum; and tungstate ion and/or molybdate ion. The aqueous autodeposition coating composition is capable of forming a highly corrosion-resistant, strongly adherent resin film on metal surfaces when brought into contact with the surface of a metal, for example, a ferriferous metal,15 zinciferous metal, aluminiferous metal, magnesium-based metal, and the like. 

 RELATED ARTAutodeposition coating compositions are acidic coating compositions that contain an organic film-forming resin and form a resin film on a metal surface when brought into contact with the metal surface. Autodeposition coating compositions are disclosed in, for example,Japanese Patent Publication Number Sho 47-17630 [17,630/1972],Japanese Patent Publication Number Sho 48-14412 [14,412/1973],Japanese Patent Publication Number Sho 52-21006 [21,006/1977],Japanese Patent Publication Number Sho 52-35692 [35,692/1977], Japanese Patent Publication Number Sho 53-15093 [15,093/1978],Japanese Patent Publication Number Sho 53-44949 [44,949/1978],Japanese Patent Application Laid Open [Kokai or Unexamined] Number Sho 60-58474 [58,474/1985],Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Number Sho 61-168673 [168,673/1986], andJapanese Patent Application Laid Open Number Sho 61-246267 [246,267/1986].A characteristic feature of the known coating compositions is their ability to lay down a resin film upon immersion of a clean metal surface in the particular 

coating composition. Moreover, the coating film's thickness and weight increase with immersion time. In the case of these compositions, the chemical activity of the coating composition overlying the metal surface (metal ion eluted from the metal surface by etching induces association of the resin particles with resulting deposition on the metal surface) results in the efficient deposition of a resin film on the metal surface without the application, as in electrodeposition, of an external electrical source.One example of a metal ion-containing coating composition is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication Number Sho 52-35692.
