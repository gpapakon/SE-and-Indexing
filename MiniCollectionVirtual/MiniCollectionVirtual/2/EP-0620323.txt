<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an exhauster fan system 
used in, but not limited to, road sweeping vehicles (10) of 

the suction-type and more specifically to a 
hydrostatic transmission system for driving an 

exhauster fan. 
The invention comprises an exhauster fan system 
for a road sweeping machine comprising a rotatable 

fan (21), drive means and a hydrostatic transmission system (25,26) 
coupled between the drive means and a spindle on which 

the fan (21) is mounted the output of which transmission 
system is controlled to apply a constant torque to the 

fan spindle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an exhauster fan 
system used in, but not limited to, road sweeping 
vehicles of the suction-type and more specifically to 
a hydrostatic transmission system for driving an 
exhauster fan. Many suction-type road sweeping vehicles 
utilise a centrifugal exhauster fan for their 
sweeping action. The fan is the means used for 
generating the air flow in a suction or vacuum-type 
machine. The fan generates a vacuum within an 
airtight container mounted on the vehicle chassis. 
Debris from the road is initially collected by brush 
means and positioned adjacent the mouth of one or 
more suction conduits connected to the container. 
The vacuum generated by the fan causes a high 
velocity air flow in the conduits which induces the 
debris into the conduits mouth and it is sucked 
through suction conduits and deposited in the 
container. Once in the container, the debris is 
separated from the air by means of a separation 
system, and the air flow is exhausted by the fan to 
the atmosphere. The drive means used to drive the fan may be 
purely mechanical, or hydrostatic by way of fixed 
displacement pump and motor combinations or a 
variable displacement pump with a fixed displacement 
motor combinations. In existing sweeping machines, the maximum duty 
of the exhauster fan is set by the maximum speed, 
which is often the normal operating speed, at which 
the prime moving engine can drive it. The prime 
mover engine is therefore normally selected so as to 
be able to drive the fan at a speed whereby it is 
expected to consume the maximum volume of air. The  
 
fan is therefore usually driven at a constant speed. Where a variable displacement pump is used, it 
is necessary to include means to control the flow of 
fluid to control the fan motor at a fixed operating 
speed. One of the characteristics of such suction-type 
sweeping machines, is that the power requirement of 
the fan, when running at a set speed, is at its 
greatest when the least amount of debris is being 
conveyed. This condition arises when the fan is 
handling its maximum duty of air. Once debris is 
entrained in the air, the air flow is consequentially 
impeded by the debris entering the nozzle such that 
the power requirement falls. This has the disadvantageous effect that the 
fans in such machines are not used efficiently in 
terms of power consumption and they tend to produce 
excessive noise emission at maximum air flow when 
least work is being effected. It is an object of the present invention to 
overcome these
