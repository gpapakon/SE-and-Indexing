<ABSTRACT>
A known UV sensor having a housing having an entry opening for the UV radiation, in which housing there is arranged a photodetector for the measurement of the UV radiation which is incident through the entry opening, and having a scattering element which is arranged in front of the photodetector in the direction of the incident UV radiation and contains SiO2. In order to improve the known UV sensor so that it supplies reproducible measurement results which are stable over a longer time and that it can be produced simply and economically, it is proposed that the scattering element contains quartz glass (fused silica), having internal boundary surfaces whose orientation in space is distributed statistically homogeneously.
