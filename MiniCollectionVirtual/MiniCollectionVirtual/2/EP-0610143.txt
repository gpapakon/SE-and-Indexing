<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for both mechanically and electrically locking a remote control unit for a modular circuit breaker. This device includes a retractable ring (15) pivoting about a shaft and provided with a locking unit (17) arranged to interact with a stop stud (18) arranged at the periphery of a drum (12) which rotates about a shaft and carrying a manual control handle (11) having two stable positions. The retractable ring (15) furthermore carries a bell-crank (21) intended to actuate a switch (14) mounted on the supply circuit of the remote control unit. This device is advantageous in that it further allows padlocking or lead-sealing of the retractable ring.

A device for mechanical and electrical lockout of a remote control unit for a 
modular circuit breaker, this remote control unit being provided with a handle having 

two stable positions respectively open and closed, and means for making and 
breaking the electrical power supply to this unit, characterized in that it comprises a 

retractable ring (15) equipped with a part for mechanical blocking of the handle when 
the latter is in its open position, and means (21, 40, 41, 42) for actuating a switch 

equipping the electrical power supply circuit of the remote control unit. 
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that said retractable ring (15) and 
said actuating means (21, 41) are interactive. 
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that said retractable ring (15) 
comprises a locking nose (17) and that said handle (11) comprises a stop stud (18), 

these two elements being arranged to cooperate and perform mechanical blocking of 
the handle in the open position, the retractable ring being raised. 
The device according to claim 3, characterized in that said retractable ring 
comprises an opening (19) to pass the bow of a padlock through when this ring is 

raised. 
The device according to claim 3, characterized in that said retractable ring 
comprises an opening (31) to pass a sealing wire (30) through when this ring is 

raised. 
The device according to claim 3, characterized in that said stop stud (18) is 
securedly united to a drum (12) rotating around a fixed spindle (13) and bearing said 

handle (11). 
The device according to claim 2, characterized in that said actuating means (21) 
comprise a rocker (21) pivoting around a fixed spindle and arranged to push an arm 

(22) back against a pushbutton (23) of a switch (14) fitted on the electrical power 
supply circuit of the remote control unit.  

 
The device according to claim 2, characterized in that said actuating means (41) 
comprise a slide (40) securedly united to a pushbutton (41) and associated to means 

for interrupting the power supply of the electrical circuit of the remote control unit. 
The device according to claim 8, characterized in that said means for interrupting 
the power supply comprise an insulating tab (42) securedly united to the slide (40) 

and arranged to be interposed between two conducting blades (43, 44) fitted in said 
electrical circuit. 
The device according to claim 8, characterized in that said slide (40) comprises 
an end arranged to block said retractable ring (15) in the retracted position. 
The device according to claim 9, characterized in that said end of the slide (40) is 
arranged to cooperate with a fr
ont edge (45) of the retractable ring (15) to prevent 
closing of the power supply circuit of the remote control unit when said ring is raised.
