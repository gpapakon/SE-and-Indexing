<ABSTRACT>
The joints (18) in a downhole jointed tubular 
structure (12), such as a well bore casing or production 

tubing, in a subterranean well, are sensed or logged by 
moving a detector (20) through the jointed tubular structure 

(12) on an elongated positioning member (22), such as a 
slick line. As the detector (20) passes through each joint 

(18), it electromagnetically senses the joint and 
responsively generates an electric output signal which is 

used to momentarily change the tension in the positioning 
member (22). This tension change, which may be either an 

increase or a decrease, serves as a mechanical output signal 
transmitted upwardly through the positioning member (22), 

and may be plotted on a strip chart recorder (34) at the 
surface to record the joint locations and correlate them to 

the lowered depth odometer (36) readings of the detection 
system. Using this joint detection apparatus, correlative 

joint logging procedures may be carried out for tool setting 
purposes without the necessity of utilizing an electrical 

conductor line.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to well
logging apparatus and more particularly to a method and
apparatus for detecting joints at adjacent sections of a
jointed tubular structure, such as a bore hole casing or
production tubing, in a subterranean well.It is often necessary in a completed subterranean
well to precisely locate one or more of the joints that join
the various longitudinal sections of a jointed tubular
structure, such as a bore hole casing or production tubing.
This need arises, for example, when it is necessary to
precisely locate a tool such as a perforating gun, or
another downhole structure such as a packer, within the
jointed tubular structure relative to a well structure
previously installed therein, such as a set of casing
perforations. The tool to be set at a predetermined
location within the tubular structure is typically lowered
into the tubular structure on an elongated positioning
member such as a slick line or a length of coil tubing, and
the depth of the previously installed well structure may be
readily found on the previously recorded joint and tally log
for the well.Given this readily available information, it would
seem at first glance to be a rather straightforward task to
simply lower 
the tool into the tubular structure until the lowered depth
odometer reading for the elongated positioning member was equal
to the indicated joint log and tally depth for the previously
installed well structure plus (or minus as the case may be) the
desired offset distance between the tool to be set and the
previously installed well structure. However, due to the
considerable stretch of the elongated positioning member at
substantial tool lowering depths, this approach is often
characterized by an unacceptably low degree of tool positioning
accuracy. Specifically, the odometer reading is not identical
to the actual lowered depth of the tool.For years the drilling and well services have employed
various correlative joint logging techniques to indirectly
overcome these tool positioning inaccuracies. One such technique,
described for example in US-A-3,088,068,
entails the lowering of an electronic joint sensor into the
jointed tubular structure on an electrically conductive wireline
to detect a spaced series of joints in the general vicinity of
the desired tool positioning location, and determine the lengths
between the adjacent pairs of joints using the joint-to-joint
odometer readings.Using the fact that the joint-to-joint lengths in a jointed
tubular structure such as a bore hole
