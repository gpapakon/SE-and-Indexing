<ABSTRACT>
A case (10) comprising a substantially rigid central frame portion (20) defining at least one side-facing open edge and a plurality of substantially parallel rib-receiving tracks (28) substantially parallel to the open edge of the case; at least one movable side compartment (12, 14) defining a substantially rigid rib (16) extending peripherally therefrom and dimensioned for slidable engagement within said rib-receiving tracks and arranged for selectable engagement within any one of said rib-receiving tracks in such a way that none of the tracks is exposed outside the compartment; wherein said at least one side compartment is movable with respect to said central portion from one rib receiving track to another to obtain a desired volume.

<DESCRIPTION>
 EXPANDABLE CASEFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to hand luggage in general and, in particular, to expandable suitcases and the like.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Suitcases, briefcases, and other hand carried luggage are generally manufactured in a variety of sizes and volumes. Collapsible suitcases, wherein it is possible to remove one or more walls of the suitcase for convenience in transportation, are known. These suitcases may include walls which are retained in place by friction, or those retained within grooves defined in the outer frame. See, for example, GB 2,079,255A, US 3,748,358, and DE 26 15 447. These cases can all be collapsed, but none of them is adapted to be expanded beyond a single basic size, in case of need.There are also known briefcases having several walls folded in accordion folds which are capable of flattening out when the case is filled so as to increase the volume therein. These folds are a weak point of the case, the case not having a substantially rigid central portion for carrying objects.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a case which is readily expandable all around 

 the perimeter to one of a number of different sizes, which is easy to assemble and expand, and inexpensive to manufacture.There is thus provided in accordance with the present invention a case including side walls and a central frame portion, and substantially rigid elements on the side walls adapted to engage substantially rigid complementary elements on the central frame portion, the side walls being adapted to move a predetermined distance relative to the central frame portion so as to expand the case to one of a plurality of substantially predetermined case sizes.There is further provided in accordance with the present invention an expandable case including at least one removable side end portion, the open edge of the removable side end portion defining a peripheral projecting rib, a bottom central portion defining along at least one side thereof a plurality of rib receiving tracks, and a top central portion defining along at least one side thereof a plurality of rib receiving tracks in registration with the tracks of the bottom central portion, the projecting rib being arranged for selectable seating in the rib receiving tracks of the' top and bottom central portions.According to a preferred embodiment, the top central portion defines a flange arranged to overlap the bottom central portion in the assembled case.According to one

 CLAIMS
1. A case comprising: a subtantially rigid central frame portion defining at least one side-facing open edge and a plurality of substantially parallel rib-receiving tracks substantially parallel to the open edge of the case;
at least one movable side compartment defining a substantially rigid rib extending peripherally therefrom and dimensioned for slideble engagment within said rib-receiving tracks and arranged for selectable engagment within any one of said rib-receiving tracks in such a way that none of the tracks is exposed outside the compartment;
wherein said at least one side compartment is movable with respect to said central portion from one rib receiving track to another to obtain a desired volume.
2. An expandable case having a volume, the case comprising:
a bottom central portion defining an tipen side-facing edge along at least one side thereof with a 


 plurality of substantially parallel rib receiving tracks parallel to said open side-facing edge;
a top central portion defining an open side-facing edge along at least one side thereof with a plurality of substantially parallel rib receiving tracks parallel to said open side-facing edge in registration with the tracks of the bottom central portion; and
at least one movable side compartment, an open edge of the movable side compartment defining a peripheral projecting rib dimensioned for slidable engagement in said rib receiving tracks of the top and bottom cnetral portions, wherein said at least one side compartment is movable with respect to said top and bottom central portions from one rib receiving track to another to obtain a desired volume.
3. A case according to claim 2, wherein said at least one movable side compartment comprises two movable side compartments, wherein said top central portion and said bottom central portion each define two open side-facing edges along opposite sides thereof and a plurality of rib receiving tracks substantially parallel to each of said open edges along both said edges, each of said side compartments defining a peripherally projecting rib dimensioned for slidable engagement in said tracks, one on either side of the top and bottom central portions; 


 wherein the side compartments are movable with respect to one another from one rib receiving track to another to obtain a desired volume.
4. A case according to claim 2, and wherein said bottom central portion and said top central portion define said rib receiving tracks on said one side thereof, the other side of each merging into a non-movable side compartment.
5. A case according to claim 2 and wherein:
the bottom central portion comprises two portions coupled by hinge elements, at least one of said portions defining said plurality of rib receiving tracks along its non-hinged side; and
said top central portion consists of two portions couplable by complementary closure elements, at least one of said portions defining said plurality of rib receiving tracks along the side thereof not having a closure element.
6. A case according to claim 3 and wherein:
the bottom central portion comprises two portions coupled by hinge elements, each portion defining said plurality of rib receiving tracks along its non-hinged side; and 


 said top central portion consists of two portions, each portion defining the plurality of rib receiving tracks along one side thereof and being provided with complementary closure elements on their sides which do not define tracks.
7. A case according to any of claims 2-6 and wherein the top central portion defines a flange arranged to overlap the bottom central portion in the assembled case.
8. A case substantially as shown and described hereinabove or as illustrated in any of the drawings. 

AMENDED CLAIMS
[received by the International Bureau on 29 October 1992 (29.10.92); original claim 8 cancelled; other claims unchanged (1 page)] said top central portion consists of two portions, each portion defining the plurality of rib receiving tracks along one side thereof and being provided with complementary closure elements on their sides which do not define tracks,
7. A case according to any of claims 2-6 and wherein the top central portion defines a flange arranged to overlap the bottom central portion in the assembled case.
