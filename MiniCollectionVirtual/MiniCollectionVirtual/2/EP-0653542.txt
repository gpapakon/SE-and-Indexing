<ABSTRACT>
The one sealing component comprises a sealing lip (3) inclinedly formed from the middle of the basic projection (1) with a right-angled bend (4) back toward the profile axis, which runs through the anchoring food. The second sealing component comprises a hose-shaped sealing body (6,7) evolving from the basic projection (1) near to the sealing lip (3), with at least one outwardly extending sealing lip point (10). The hose-shaped sealing body is formed by a curved sealing lip (6), which is centrally connected arc-shaped to the basic projection, and from which centrally an angular formation (7) to the basic projection (1) is provided, forming a side wall of the hollow chamber (8), and enclosing a recess (9) near to the curved sealing lip point (10).
