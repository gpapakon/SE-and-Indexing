<ABSTRACT>
In the preparation of polyester by conducting ring-opening 
polymerization of a cyclic ester compound in the presence of a hydroxyl 

compound as a molecular weight regulator in the reaction system, the 
molecular weight of polyester can be accurately controlled in the 

desired range by previously estimating the amount of free carboxylic 
acid contained in the cyclic ester compound and controlling the amount 

of the hydroxyl compound on the basis of the estimated amount.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a preparation process of polyester
by ring-opening polymerization of a cyclic ester compound. More
particularly, the invention relates to a reproducible and consistent
process for conducting ring-opening polymerization of a cyclic ester
compound to prepare polyesters of a desired molecular weight which
include polyhydroxycarboxylic acids such as polyglycolic acid,
polylactic acid, polycaprolactone, polypropiolactone, polybutyrolactone
and polyvalerolactone and copolymers thereof.Polyesters including polyhydroxycarboxylic acids such as
polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, polycaprolactone, polypropiolactone,
polybutyrolactone and polyvalerolactone and copolymers thereof can be
prepared by ring-opening polymerization of cyclic ester compounds such
as lactide, glycolide and ε-caprolactone. These polyesters can be
decomposed with ease by water and enzyme and thus have been focused
attention as biodegradable polymers.Particularly, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid and a lactic
acid/glycolic acid copolyester which are prepared by ring-opening
polymerization of lactide, glycolide and a mixture of these compounds,
respectively, can be decomposed and absorbed with extreme ease in a
living body. Consequently, these compounds are also referred to as
bioabsorbable polymers and are used for medical materials such as a
surgical suture, matrix resin of slow release microspheric drugs and an
absorbable plate for bonesetting. Further, in a field other than
medical use, application to various formed materials such as films and 
sheets is under development.In any cases, it is desired to have satisfactory mechanical strength
and hydrolyzability for respective used and thus required to maintain a
certain level of mechanical strength for a prescribed period and
thereafter to decompose quickly. In order to meet these
characteristics, it is essentially important to limit the molecular
weight of polyesters to a specific range, and additionally to restrict
the copolymer composition to a certain range.Various processes have been known for the preparation of cyclic
ester compounds. As a general process, hydroxycarboxylic acid which
corresponds to the desired cyclic ester compound is subjected to
dehydration ring-closure. For example, lactide or glycolide is
individually prepared by heating lactic acid or glycolic acid under
reduced pressure to conduct dehydration condensation and by further
heating the resultant lactic acid oligomer or glycolic acid oligomer to
form a cyclic dimer through
