<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing D-lactic
acid and L-lactamide by biochemical asymmetric hydrolysis of
DL-lactamide. The D-lactic acid obtained in the present invention
is a useful compound as a raw material for herbicides based on
optically active phenoxypropionic acid or diphenyl ether and for the
various pharmaceuticals. Further, it is also expected that the
compound can be used as a raw material for biodegradable polymers.Optically active lactic acid has been produced by
fermentation using a sugar as the substrate, but such fermentation
processes require a considerable long period of time and troublesome
operations for the separation, purification, etc. of the lactic
acid formed, the concentration of the accumulated product being as
low as the level of 10 % at best. The production of D-lactic acid
by fermentation is disclosed in e.g. Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Application No. 173596/88 and Japanese Patent Publication No.
38593/93.For the enzymatic production of lactic acid, mention may be
made of the production of an optically active α-substituted
organic acid from a nitrile as the starting material (Japanese
Laid-Open Patent Application Nos. 84198/90 and 224496/91) and the
production of optically active lactic acid (Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Application Nos. 99497/92 and 219987/93).As other known processes, mention may be made of the 
production of an optically active α-hydroxycarboxylic acid from an
α-hydroxymethyl ester as the starting material (Japanese Patent
Publication No. 63397/88), the production of an optically active α
-hydroxycarboxylic acid (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No.
156892/90), the production of optically active lactic acid from 2-halogenopropionic
acid (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No.
31690/84), the production of D-lactic acid from 1,2-propanediol
(Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 271787/92).As processes using an amide as the starting material, mention
may be made of the production of optically active α-oxyacid by a
microorganism (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 88894/86),
the production of optically active α-oxyacid (Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Application No. 55098/87), the production of an optically
active α-substituted organic acid (Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Application No. 84198/90) and the production of an optically
active α-substituted organic acid (Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Application No. 224496/91).Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Nos. 88894/86, 84198/90
and 224496/91 suggests a possibility of converting
