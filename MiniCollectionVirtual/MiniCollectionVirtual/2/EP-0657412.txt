<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to derivatives of Saintopin which
have an antibacterial and anti-tumour activity and which are,
therefore, useful as antibacterial and anti-tumour agents.It is already known that compounds having an anthraquinone
skeleton such as anthracycline, have antibiotic activity [CRC Handbook
of Antibiotic Compounds, 3, 61 (1981)].The compound UCT 1003 (Saintopin), represented by the formula
(A):

is also known to have anti-tumour activity [Biochemistry, 30, 5838-5845
(1991) and Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No.
200655/90].In accordance with the present invention further derivatives of
Saintopin have been identified as having antibacterial and anti-tumour
activity.These are compounds of the formula: 

wherein R1 is hydrogen and R2 is SO2OH, or R1 is acetyl and R2 is
hydrogen.Hereinafter, the compound where R1 is hydrogen and R2 is SO20H is
referred to as UCE 1022, and the compound where R1 is acetyl and R2 is
hydrogen as Saintopin E.The compounds UCE 1022 and Saintopin E are produced by
microorganisms of the genus Paecilomyces, and can be recovered from
cultures thereof.The compound UCE 1022 has the following physicochemical
properties.
