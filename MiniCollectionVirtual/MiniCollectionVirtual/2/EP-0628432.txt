<ABSTRACT>
A loose leaf binding (10) to secure together a plurality of loose sheets. The binding 
(10) is formed of plastics material and includes am edge strip (11) to which there is 

pivotally attached a pair of flanges (13, 14). Extending from the flange (14) are 
projections (17) which snap engage in sockets (19) formed in the other flange (13). A 

retaining means (21) is located at each end of the binding (10) and is adapted to inhibit 
pivoting of the flanges (13, 14) accidentally. The securing means (21) includes a 

pivotally mounted flange (22) at each end of the strip (11), with the flanges (22) adapted 
to snap engage the ends of the flanges (13, 14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to binders and folders employed to secure together a 
plurality of loose sheets of paper. More particularly, the present invention relates to 
binding strips formed of plastics material. There is a wide variety of binders employed to bind sheets together for general 
office use. Such binders include comb binders which require the sheets to be punched 
with a plurality of rectangular slots. The comb binder has a plurality of resilient fingers 
which pass through aligned holes in the sheets. This type of binding has shown to be a 
reasonably low cost method of binding loose sheets. The above discussed comb binders do not securely bind the sheets together and do 
not provide a professional appearance in respect of the finished product. The above discussed problem was addressed by the binder described in Australian 
Patent 636080. Described in this patent is a binding strip molded from plastics material. 
The strip is generally of a "U-shaped" transverse cross section so as to have a base and a 
pair of flanges extending therefrom. The flanges are pivotally attached to the base. 
Extending from one of the flanges are projections which snap engage with apertures in the 
other flange. The projections pass through punched holes in the sheets. However this 
particular binding suffers from the disadvantage that the flanges easily separate and 
therefore the sheets contained in the binding become loose. US Patent 5,183,296 discloses a binding for loose sheets. At each end of the 
binding there is provided a pivotally movable tab which is adapted to retain the sheets 
secure to the binding. These pivotally movable tabs do not inbibit movement of the two 
flanges between which the sheets are located. US Patent 2,472,969 discloses a loose leaf binder of a relatively old and 
conventional structure. It consists of a base with a pair of flanges between which the 
loose sheets are secured. Neither of the flanges are pivotally attached to the edge strip. 
However, there is provided a mechanism by which the overall depth of the binding can be 
adjusted. US Patent 4,257,715 discloses a binding which appears to be of a pressed metal 
construction. The binding includes a pair of flanges with projections extending from a 
pivoted one of those flanges. The projections are intended to pass through loose sheets. 
The extremities of the projections are then secured to the other flange. US Patent 4,239,411 discloses a ring binder with securing straps to aid in retaining 
the binder closed. This

<CLAIMS>
A loose leaf binding 10 to secure together a plurality of loose sheets, the 
sheets having apertures through which the binding 10 extends, said binding 10 

comprising: 
   an edge strip 11 having longitudinal edge portions 12; 

   a pair of longitudinal flanges 13, 14 generally parallel and co-extensive with respect 
to the edge strip 11, with at least one of the flanges 13, 14 being pivotally attached to a 

respective one of the edge portions 12 so that the edge strip 11 is located between the two 
flanges 13, 14, said one flange 13, 14 being pivotable with respect to the edge strip 11 so 

as to be movable between a closed position in which the binding 10 is generally "U-shaped" 
in transverse cross section, and an open position; 

   a plurality of projections 16 fixed to one of the flanges 14 and extending generally 
normal therefrom and to pass through the holes in the sheets to secure the sheets to the 

binding 10; 
   a plurality of sockets 19 in the other flange 13 to the flange 14 having the 

projections 16, the sockets 19 being adapted and positioned to releasably engage the 
extremities 17 of the projections 16; 

   securing means 20 to retain each pivotably movable flange 13, 14 in the closed 
position; and wherein 

   said edge strip 11, flanges 13, 14, projections 16 and sockets 19 are integrally 
formed from plastics material. 
The binding 10 of claim 1, wherein both said flanges 13, 14 are pivotally 
attached to said edge strip 11 at said edge portions 12 
The binding 10 of claim 2, wherein said securing means 20 extends between 
the two flanges 13, 14 when said binding 10 is in its closed position. 
The binding 10 of claim 3, wherein said securing means 20 includes a 
securing assembly 21 at each end of the binding 10, each securing assembly 21 including 

a securing member 22 pivotally attached to an associated end of the strip 11, each 
securing member 22 being pivotable about an axis generally transverse of the strip 11. 
The binding 10 of claim 4, wherein each securing assembly 21 includes snap 
engaging means 23, 24 to secure the member 22 to an end portion of each of the flanges 

13, 14. 
The binding 10 of claim 1, wherein both said flanges 13, 14 are pivotally 
attached to said strip 11, and said securing means 20 includes a securing member 22 

pivotally attached to one of said flanges 13, 14 and snap engaging means 23, 24 to 
releasably attach said securing member 22 to the other flange 13, 14. 
The binding 10 of claim 6, wherein said snap engaging means 23, 24 includes 
a projection 24 extending from the flange 13 to which the securing member is pivotally 

attached and an aperture 23 in said securing member 22. 
The binding 10 of claim 1, wherein said securing means 20 includes a 
securing member 22 adapted to engage an end of at least one of the flanges 13, 14, said 

securing member 22 having an abutment 25 to engage a surface of said at least one flange 
13, 14 to prevent movement of the said one flange 13, 14 to the open position. 
A folder 50 including the binding 74 of claim 1, said folder 50 having a front 
cover sheet 72 and a back cover sheet 71, with said front cover sheet 72 being formed 

integral with one of said flanges 75, and said back cover sheet 72 being formed intregral 
with the other flange 76.
