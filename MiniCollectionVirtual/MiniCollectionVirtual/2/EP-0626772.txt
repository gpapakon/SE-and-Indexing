<ABSTRACT>
A frequency shift keying modulating circuit 
produces a first frequency according to a surface 

acoustic wave transducers (21) natural resonant 
frequency and a second frequency according to the 

surface acoustic wave transducer in combination with a reactive 
element (26). The frequency selected is determined by 

the state of a PIN switching diode (27) in parallel 
with the reactive element (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a frequency shift 
keying modulating unit for use, for example, in a low 
power transmitter used in a remote keyless entry, 
alarm or similar system for a motor vehicle. A remote system for a motor vehicle has a 
base unit in a vehicle and a remote unit carried by 
the driver. The remote unit is typically of low power 
so as to be battery operated and quite small, designed 
about the size of a keyring fob. Such remote units 
are generally configured to transmit at least a stream 
of binary data utilising known radio frequency 
transmission modulation techniques. The most common 
technique utilised in this application is Amplitude 
Shift Keying (ASK). Experience has shown that ASK may 
exhibit performance limitations in certain radio 
frequency hostile environments resulting in reduced 
range and noise immunity. One type of alternate radio frequency 
modulation technique which proves more robust than ASK 
is Frequency Shift Keying (hereinafter referred to as 
FSK) . Problems with prior art FSK circuitry are 
frequency drift and limited separation of generated 
carrier frequencies. Commonly employed varactor diode 
frequency pulling techniques yield less than the full 
frequency separation range possible, exhibit 
temperature instability characteristic of solid state 
electronics and require precise control of a reverse 
bias voltage applied thereto. Other techniques make 
use of a multiplicity of reactive element circuit 
paths for frequency pulling but likewise tend to be 
temperature drift sensitive and accomplish less than 
the full range of potential frequency separation. 
Multiple circuit paths and related switching circuitry  
 
reduce overall reliability and increase overall cost 
due to circuit complexity. The present invention seeks to provide an 
improved FSK modulating circuit. According to an aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided an FSK modulating circuit 
as specified in claim 1. It is possible in some embodiments to 
provide a transmitter having improved noise immunity 
characteristics relative to ASK systems currently 
utilised in the art, and such a transmitter in a low 
cost and highly reliable manner using only a minimal 
number of components and minimal power so as to be 
applicable to a battery operated unit. It is also 
possible in some embodiments to provide a wide 
deviation in frequency between a first and second 
transmission frequency corresponding to binary data 
transmission in a FSK modulating transmitter. A preferred embodiment
