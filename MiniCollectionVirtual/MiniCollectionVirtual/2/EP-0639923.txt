<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to the
conversion of a video format of a high definition television
(referred to hereinafter as HDTV) signal, and more
particularly to a video format conversion apparatus for an
HDTV in which the video format of the HDTV signal is converted
into a display format of an interlaced scanning type with 1050
vertical scanning lines.Basically, the HDTV signal can be encoded and decoded
into various video formats with no limitation to a single
video format. Namely, the HDTV signal can be encoded and
decoded into six video formats, an interlaced scanning format
with 1050 vertical scanning lines and a field rate of 60Hz,
progressive scanning formats with 1050 vertical scanning lines
and frame rates of 24Hz and 30Hz, and progressive scanning
formats with 787.5 vertical scanning lines and frame rates of
24Hz, 30Hz and 60Hz.In encoding and decoding the HDTV signal, the video
formats with the frame rates 24Hz and 30Hz are used for a film
mode, since they makes transmission of a movie film more
efficient. Although the transmitted video formats are various as
mentioned above, a display format is limited to a single type
depending on a characteristic of a monitor. This requires a
video format conversion apparatus which is capable of
converting any video format of the HDTV signal into the
display format depending on the characteristic of the monitor. EP-A-0 414 596 discloses a device wherein frame
frequency and the number of lines are output to
corrresponding output formats during reading, using a
memory. Thus, the conversion of frame frequency is
performed depending on how to read the frame frequency in
the memory. More specifically, the device disclosed therein
is a device for conversion of frame frequency and number of
lines for a high-definition television receiver able to
receive input video signals corresponding to different
standards and to give an output of a high-definition signal
at desired frame frequency and with the desired number of
lines. This device uses a pass-band reduction decoder
processing the high-definition input 625/2:1/50 Hz video
signals, and includes a memory, a decoder, and a processing
circuit. The memory stores the input signals. This memory
is read at the frame frequency desired at the output. The
decoder is a pass-band reduction decoder connected to the
memory and separately gives at its outputs even and odd
frames, respectively, of a decompressed high-definition
video signal output at the frame frequency desired. The
video processing circuit is
