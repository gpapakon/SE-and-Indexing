<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of unrolling advertisements arranged in the form of a band, optionally with use of deflection rollers, the band unrolling from a driven first reel and rolling up on to a driven second reel and vice versa. In order to compensate for the roll radii, it is provided that the two reels are driven at the same speed and the band is held between the two reels under resilient stressing applied by at least one of the reels. In the case of a corresponding device for unrolling advertisements arranged in the form of a band, having a first driven reel (2) and a second driven reel (3) for receiving the band (1) and optionally having deflection rollers (42, 43), each driven reel exhibiting a rotatably mounted cylinder jacket (5), for receiving a band roll and a rotatably mounted driven shaft (4), it is provided that, in the case of at least one reel (2), the shaft (4) is connected to the associated cylinder jacket (5) via at least one spring device (8) which is prestressed in the rolling-up direction.
