<ABSTRACT>
A stowable soft top for convertible vehicles (cabriolet vehicles) has a soft-top frame (7) which comprises a tensioning strut (8) for the soft-top material, which strut forms the lower edge of the soft top (2), a soft-top compartment (10) which receives the folded soft top (2) and a soft-top compartment lid (6) which in each case closes or opens the compartment. Said soft-top compartment lid can be pivoted via a pivoting support (16) supported on the vehicle body into a closed position and in this position the soft top (2) is secured in a position of support on the soft-top compartment lid (6) by means of at least one closing part (13) which is situated on the tensioning strut (8) of the soft-top material and engages in a respective fastening device (12). The soft-top compartment lid (6) is provided with an actuating device (15) which, during the closing procedure, imparts to the lid, in the region of the pivoting support (16), a horizontal control movement, at least in phases, in such a manner that the closing part (13) of the tensioning strut (8) of the soft-top material is grasped by the fastening device (12) and the soft top (2) can be brought with pretension into the position of support.

A stowable folding top for a cabriolet vehicle, with a 
framework (7) which comprises a top-fabric tensioning member 

(8) which forms the bottom closure member of the soft top 
(2), a box (10) which holds the folded top (2) and, for 

closing or opening the box (10), a cover (6) which, by means 
of a pivot mounting (16) supported on the vehicle body, is 

able to pivot into a closed position, in which the folding 
top (2) is fixed in a position in which it rests on the 

cover (6) via at least one closure member (13) disposed on 
the top-fabric tensioning member (8) and engaging a 

respective locking device (12), characterised in that the 
box cover (6) is provided with an actuating device (15) 

which, during the closing process, imparts to the cover (6) 
at least phasewise and in the region of the pivot mounting 

(16) a controlling movement, such that the closure member 
(13) of the top-fabric tensioning member (8) is gripped by 

the locking device (12) and the folding top (2) can be 
brought with initial tension into the resting position. 
A stowable folding top according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the box cover (6) can, by means of the 

actuating device (15) be pivoted during the closing process 
into a folded position which crosses the path of movement of 

the closure member (13), in which folded position the 
closure member (13) is gripped by the locking device (12) in 

a respective catch aperture (17) and, in this connection 
position, the folding top (2) and the box cover (6) can be 

moved jointly via their pivot/push movement into the resting 
position which tensions the top-fabric (3).  

 
A stowable folding top according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the box cover (6) has at its front 

marginal portions and symmetrically in relation to the 
longitudinal axis (21) of the vehicle catch hooks (19) which 

in the closed position engage mating mountings (18) 
supported on the body work. 
A stowable folding top according to one of claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that the actuating device (15) has, 

mounted on the rear (22) of the body, on the inside and in 
the region of the longitudinal axis (21) of the vehicle, a 

reversing lever (23) which has on a first free arm (24) and 
directed towards the box cover (6) a connecting member (25) 

which is connected via cross-struts (26, 27) projecting at 
right-angles to the longitudinal axis (21) of the vehicle 

and having parallelogram hinges (16) which are at one end 
supported on the vehicle rear (22) and holding the box cover 

(6) at the other, the reversing lever (23) having a drive 
member (31) on a second free arm (24'). 
A stowable folding top according to claim 4, characterised 
in that the reversing lever (23) is in the region of 

the first free arm (24') provided with a transmission lever 
(33) articulated directly and/or via a bowden cable (36) on 

the drive member (31) and a range of movement of which is 
limited by an abutment part (34). 
A stowable folding top according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in that the reversing lever (23) is in the 

region of the connecting member (25) provided with sliding 
pairing parts (35) which simultaneously impart a reversible 

rotary movement to both cross-struts (26, 27) at the same 
time, the outer end portions of the cross-struts (26, 27)  

 
being connected to the parallelogram hinges (16) to form 

respective hinge pins (37). 
A stowable folding top according to one of claims 4 to 
6, characterised in that the parallelogram hinges (16) are 

each provided with a holding plate (39) fixed on the box 
cover (6), a connecting lever (40) projecting from the plate 

(39) and having marginally disposed control levers (41, 42) 
and, disposed between these latter, tensioning levers (43) 

which are supported on the body work rear (22) for pivoted 
movement jointly with the control levers (41, 42). 
A stowable folding top according to one of claims 1 to 
7, characterised in that the locking device (12) is 

constructed as a pot-shaped interlocking device (48) which 
accommodates the closure member (13) via a flap (47) which 

is connected to a microswitch (50). 
A stowable folding top according to one of claims 1 to 
8, particularly according to claim 3, characterised in that 

each catch hook (19) can be brought into a connecting 
engagement with a catch bolt (55) disposed on the mating 

mounting (18) via a switching tongue (54) which comprises an 
electrical contactor (53). 
A stowable folding top according to one of claims 1 to 
9, characterised in that the box cover (6), when the folding 

top (2) is stowed inside the box (10), is secured in its 
covered position both by means of the actuating device (15) 

and also by the respective catch hooks (19).
