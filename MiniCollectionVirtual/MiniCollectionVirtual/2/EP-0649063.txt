<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a recording material having a support (carrier, substrate, base), a radiation-sensitive layer containing a 1,2-naphthoquinone 2-diazide and an organic, polymeric binder which is insoluble in water, but soluble in aqueous-alkaline solutions, and a non-continuous matting layer located thereon. This matting layer comprises from 100 to 10000 particles per square centimetre having a mean diameter of less than 40  mu m and a maximum diameter of less than 80  mu m and a mean height from 2 to 6  mu m and a maximum height of 10  mu m which contain a resin containing up to 0.80 mmol of acid and/or salt groups per gram. The matting layer is obtained by spraying on and drying an aqueous, anionically or anionically/nonionically stabilised dispersion of the resin.
