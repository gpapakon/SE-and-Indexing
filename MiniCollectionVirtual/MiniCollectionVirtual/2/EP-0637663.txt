<ABSTRACT>
A flat key (1, 16, 22) and/or a lock cylinder (4) with a cylinder plug (3), which is rotatably mounted in the cylinder housing and which has tumblers (6), carries stops (7) which limit the depth of insertion of the key (1, 16, 22) into the keyway (2, 18, 23). These stops (7) comprise, on the key (1, 16, 22), projections (8, 15, 19) or depressions oriented in the longitudinal direction of the key and, on the end face of the cylinder plug (3), corresponding depressions (9, 17, 20) or projections. The stop face defining the depth of insertion is located either on the projection (15, 19), when the length of the latter is greater than the depth of the depression, or outside the projection (8) or depression, when the projection (8) penetrates into the depression (9), without touching the latter. The projection can be designed as an inclined tooth (19).

<CLAIMS>
Flat key (1, 16, 22) with a key grip for a lock
cylinder (4) with cylinder core (3, 21) which is

rotatably mounted in a housing and which has a key
channel (2) into which the flat key (1, 16, 22) can be

inserted to a given depth for displacing tumblers,
which depth can be fixed by means of stop regions on a

stop boss (7, 14) between key grip and key shaft and on
a further surface, radially aligned to the direction of

insertion, offset in relation to the front face of the
stop boss (7, 14), 
characterised
 in that the projection
(8, 15, 19) is directly arranged on the stop boss (7,

14), axially overlapping this in the direction of the
key point, or that an axial recess is arranged directly

in the stop boss (7, 14), wherein the projection (8,
15, 19) on the stop boss (7, 14) is provided for

engagement in a recess (9, 17, 20) of the cylinder core
(3, 21) or the recess in the stop boss (7, 14) is

provided for receiving a projection of the cylinder
core (3, 21).
Flat key (1, 16, 22) and lock cylinder (4) with a
cylinder core (3, 21) which is rotatably mounted in a

housing and which has a key channel into which the flat
key (1, 16, 22) can be inserted to a given depth for

displacing the tumblers (6), which depth can be fixed
by means of stop regions on a stop boss (7, 14) between

key grip and key shaft, and on a further surface
aligned radially to the direction of insertion, offset

in relation to the front face of the stop boss (7, 14),

characterised
 in that the projection (8, 15, 19) is
provided directly on the stop boss (7), axially

overlapping this in the direction of the key point, or
that an axial recess is provided directly in the stop

boss (7, 14), or that in the cylinder core (3, 21)
below the opening of the key channel (2, 18) there is

provided a recess (9, 17, 21) into which dips the 
projection (8, 15, 19) of the stop boss (7, 14) or that

the cylinder core (3, 21) has a projection which is
received by the recess in the stop boss (7).
Flat key and lock cylinder according to claim 2,

characterised
 in that the length of the projection (8)
is less than the depth of the recesses (9), wherein the

effective stop, which positions the key (1), is
situated outside the projection (8) and the recess (9).
Flat key and lock cylinder according to claim 2,

characterised
 in that the length of the projection (15,
19) is the same as, but preferably longer than the

depth of the recess (17, 20), and the base surface of
the recess (17, 20) as well as the front face of the

projection (15, 19) are constructed as contact
surfaces.
Flat key and lock cylinder according to one of the
claims 2 to 4, 
characterised
 in that on the stop boss
(7) between key grip and key shaft there is provided a

front face, aligned radially to the direction of
insertion, which when the key is inserted extends

substantially parallel to the front face of the cylinder
core and that the projection (8, 15) axially overlaps

the front face and dips into a recess (9, 17) arranged
opposite and if necessary rests against the base of the

recess (17).
Flat key and lock cylinder according to claim 2,

characterised
 in that the projection (19) is
constructed as a sloping stop surface, for example as a

tooth in the grip projection it is constructed to slope
towards the key shaft, and in the cylinder core (21) is

provided a recess (20) for receiving the slope or a
recess is provided for resting against the slope or a

part of it.
