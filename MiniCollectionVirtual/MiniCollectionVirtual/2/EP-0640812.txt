<ABSTRACT>
A method of using a fluorescent fluid on a cell-engraved 
surface, such as an anilox roll, to determine 

the volumetric capacity of the cell-engraved surface by 
having the amount of electromagnetic radiation emitted 

by the exciting of the fluorescent fluid substantially 
proportional to the volume of the fluorescent fluid in 

the cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of using 
fluorescent means to measure the volumetric capacity of 
a selected area, such as the volumetric capacity of a 
fluid metering roller. In the printing industry, fluid metering or 
transfer rolls are used to transfer measured amounts of 
ink onto printing plates. The rolls are generally 
referred to as anilox rolls. In other industries, 
liquid glue or other substances can be transferred onto 
surfaces of various substrates. The metering rolls are 
generally engraved with an array of closely spaced, 
shallow depressions referred to as cells. In the 
printing industry, ink is fed into the cells and onto 
the transfer surface of an anilox roll from an ink 
transfer roll turning within an ink bath. To remove 
the excess ink from the anilox roll surface, a doctor 
blade is scraped against the roll so that excess ink is 
removed and the remaining ink on the anilox roll is 
contained only in the cells. The ink in the cells is 
then transferred to a substrate, such as a polymer or 
paper material. The design or image formed by the ink 
cells is thus imprinted on the substrate. The anilox roll is generally cylindrical and may 
be constructed in various diameters and lengths, 
containing cells of various sizes and shapes. The 
volumetric capacity of an anilox roll for a fluid such 
as ink is dependent upon the selection of cell size and 
shape, and number of cells per unit area. The cell  
 
pattern or design may be fine (many small cells per 
square inch ) or coarse (fewer larger cells per square 
inch). Anilox rolls having high cell density are used 
for high-quality printing and rolls having the largest 
cells are used in non-printing applications such as the 
application of glue or paint. Within the printing industry, the volumetric 
capacity of an anilox metering roll is specified as a 
combination of metric and English units (billions of 
cubic microns per square inch [BCM/inch2]) and can vary 
from one billion cubic microns per square inch to 
possibly 500 billion cubic microns per square inch (one 
BCM = 1 microliter). In a conventional printing 
operation, the anilox roll is forced against a printing 
plate and against a doctor blade during ink transfer 
with the result that surface friction wear occurs. 
This surface wear of the anilox roll can reduce the 
volume of the anilox roll. To maintain high quality 
printing applications or non-printing applications such 
as applications of glue or paint, it is necessary to 
accurately determine the volumetric
