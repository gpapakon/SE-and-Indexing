<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cleaner for hard surfaces, such 
as bathtubs, sinks, tiles, porcelain and enamelware, which 
removes soap scum, lime scale and grease from such surfaces 
without harming them. More particularly, the invention relates 
to an acidic microemulsion that can be sprayed onto the surface 
to be cleaned, and wiped off without usual rinsing and still 
leave the cleaned surface bright and shiny. The invention also 
relates to a method for using such compositions. Hard surface cleaners, such as bathroom cleaners and 
scouring cleansers, have been known for many years. Scouring 
cleansers normally include a soap or synthetic organic detergent 
or surface active agent and an abrasive. Such products can 
scratch relatively soft surfaces and can eventually cause them to 
appear dull. These products are often ineffective to remove lime 
scale (usually encrusted calcium and magnesium carbonates) in 
normal use. Because lime scale can be removed by chemical 
reactions with acidic media various acidic cleaners have been 
produced and have met with various degrees of success. In some 
instances such cleaners have been failures because the acid 
employed was too strong and damaged the surfaces being cleaned. 
At other times, the acidic component of the cleaner reacted 
objectionably with other components of the product which 
adversely affected the detergent or perfume. Some cleaners 
required rinsing afterward to avoid leaving objectionable 
deposits on the cleaned surfaces. As a result of research 
performed in efforts to overcome the mentioned disadvantages  
 
there has recently been made an improved liquid cleaning 
composition in stable microemulsion form which is an effective 
cleaner to remove soap scum, lime scale and greasy soils from 
hard surfaces, such as bathroom surfaces and which does not 
require rinsing after use. Such a product is described in U.S. 
patent application S.N. 120,250 for Stable Microemulsion Cleaning 
Composition filed November 12, 1987 by Loth, Blanvalet and 
Valenge, which application is hereby incorporated by reference. 
In particular, Example 3 of that application discloses an acidic, 
clear, oil-in-water microemulsion which is therein described as 
being successfully employed to clean shower wall tiles of lime 
scale and soap scum that had adhered to them. Such cleaning was 
effected by applying the cleaner to the walls followed by wiping 
or minimal rinsing after which the walls were allowed to dry to a 
good shine. The described microemulsion cleaner of

<CLAIMS>
An acidic microemulsion hard surface cleaner 
composition which has a pH in the range of 1 to 4 which 

removes lime scale, soap scum and greasy soil from hard 
surfaces characterised in that it comprises a detersive 

proportion of synthetic organic detergent, which is 
capable of removing greasy soil from such surfaces; a 

lime scale and soap scum removing proportion of an alpha 
hydroxy aliphatic acid, an aminoalkylenephosphonic acid, 

water and a perfume. 
A composition as claimed in claim 1 characterised 
in that the said alpha hydroxy aliphatic acid has 2 to 6 

carbon atoms. 
A composition as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that the aminoalkylenephosphonic acid 

contains 1 to 3 amino nitrogen(s), 3 or 4 lower 
alkylenephosphonic acid groups and 0 to 2 lower alkylene 

groups of 2 to 6 carbon atoms each, which alkylene(s) 
is/are present and connect(s) amino nitrogen when a 

plurality of such nitrogen is present in the 
aminoalkylenephosphonic acid. 
A composition as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3 
characterised in that the ratio of the said alpha hydroxy 

aliphatic acid to the said aminoalkylenephosphonic acid 
is in the range of 5:1 to 250:1. 
A composition as claimed in claim 1, 2, 3 or 4 
characterised in that the synthetic organic detergent is 

a C₈₋₁₈ alkyl sulphate surfactant. 
A composition as claimed in anyone of claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that there is also present phosphoric 

acid which improves the action of the 
aminoalkylenephosphonic acid in protecting zirconium 

white enamel surfaces of items being cleaned against the 
action of the alpha hydroxy aliphatic acid(s). 
A composition as claimed in claim 6 characterised in 
that the proportion of phosphoric acid is in the range of 

2:1 to 10:1 with respect to the aminoalkylenephosphonic 
acid and the ratio of alpha hydroxy aliphatic acid to the 

phosphoric acid is in the range of 5:2 to 25:1. 
A composition as claimed in claim 7 characterised in 
that it comprises 1 to 9% of the synthetic organic 

anionic detergent(s), 1 to 6% of synthetic organic 
anionic detergent, 2 to 9% of the alpha hydroxy aliphatic 

acid, 0.05 to 1% of the phosphoric acid and 0.01 to 0.3% 
of the aminoalkylenephosphonic acid(s). 
A composition as claimed in anyone of claims 1 to 8 
characterised in that the said alpha hydroxy aliphatic 

acid is a mixture of malic acid and lactic acid. 
A composition as claimed in anyone of claims 1 to 8 
characterised in that the said alpha hydroxy aliphatic 

acid is a citric acid.
