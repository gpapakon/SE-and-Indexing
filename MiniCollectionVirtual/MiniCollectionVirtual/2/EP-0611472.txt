<ABSTRACT>
An optical data storage disc (e.g. a compact disc) carries a digital recording and also carries a holographic image. The holographic recording occupies an area (14) separate from the area (12) occupied by the digital recording, for example the holographic recording may be positioned in an annular area encircling the central area occupied by the digital recording.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of manufacturing an 
optical data storage disc which carries both a digital data 
recording and a holographic image. The invention relates 
particularly but not solely to an optical data storage disc in 
the form of a compact disc (CD) in which the digital data 
recording is an audio recording. In forming recorded compact discs, firstly the digital 
information, primarily audio, is recorded onto a master disc 
by forming the surface of the master disc with pits of varying 
circumferential lengths, but uniform width and depth. These 
pits are formed by selectively exposing a surface coating on 
the disc with a laser beam, typically using a blue line such 
as the 457.9nm line from an Argon laser. Typically the surface 
coating comprises a high resolution positive photoresist, 
formed on a glass substrate. The areas which are exposed by 
the laser beam are developed using a caustic developer solution 
which removes the photoresist coating over those areas. The 
depth of the pits thus formed by the developer is normally in 
the range 0.1 to 0.2 microns. The exposed and developed master 
disc then has a thin layer of silver deposited onto the pits, 
normally by vacuum deposition although spray silvering and 
other techniques may be used. The master disc is then placed 
in an electroforming tank, where a layer of nickel is formed 
over the silver layer. The master disc is then put through a 
number of stages, known in the art, to produce a nickel 
stamper. This stamper is then applied to polycarbonate blank 
discs, either by pressing or vacuum forming, and the 
polycarbonate discs then receive a layer of aluminium and a 
protective coating of lacquer, which is subsequently printed 
upon. The process thus provides compact discs in playable 
form. In forming embossed holograms, a positive photoresist 
coated on a glass substrate is exposed using a blue line from 
a laser. The process comprises recording an interference 
pattern between two or more wavefronts of laser light, created 
under extremely stable conditions and normally on an isolation  
 
table. The interference pattern, or interference fringes, 
provide light and dark areas, often with complex nuances which, 
when developed, redirect light to produce three dimensional 
images or other effects. The interference fringes which are 
recorded are often of 0.3 microns or less in depth and have a 
pitch normally in the range of 0.5 microns to 5 microns. In 
forming a holographic recording the photoresist is partially 
expose
