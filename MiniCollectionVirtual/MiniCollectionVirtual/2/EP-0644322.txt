<ABSTRACT>
A non-return fuel distribution system or deadheaded fuel 
distribution system for an internal combustion engine having one or more 

fuel injectors (30) mounted on a fuel rail (28) on the engine, has a 
fuel pressure 

transducer (32) mounted on the fuel rail to sense the fuel pressure in 
the rail 

and generate an electrical signal representing such pressure. The 
electrical signal is combined in a controller to operate an electrically 

operated variable pressure fuel pump (12) to generate and maintain 
the fuel 

pressure necessary to operate the electrically operated fuel injectors in 

their linear operating pulse range.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electronic fuel injection systems having 
a fuel pressure transducer mounted in the fuel rail in general and more 
particularly to a system for controlling the fuel pump to vary the fuel 
pressure in a deadheaded, no return, fuel system for extending the 
dynamic range of a fuel injector. US patent 5,133,323 issued to Christopher J. Treusch on July 28, 
1992 and assigned to a common assignee, teaches the location of a 
signal generating fuel pressure sensor mounted on a fuel rail. In that 
patent, the fuel pressure sensor housing has sensing and circuit means 
mounted on a platform therein to measure the difference between the 
manifold absolute pressure (MAP) supplied to one input of the housing 
and the fuel pressure in the fuel rail as determined by the variable 
pressure electric fuel pump supplied to another input of the housing 
Electrical signals from the sensing and circuit means are supplied to 
control electronics for generating a signal to drive the electric fuel pump 
which is located in the fuel tank. The purpose of this system is to maintain 
the fuel pressure across the injectors at a predetermined value in 
relationship with MAP. With this predetermined value, the amount of fuel 
injected into the engine will be a function of the pulse width of the 
electrical signal generated by the electronic control unit in the fuel 
management system. A disadvantage of this prior art system is that the for extreme fuel 
demand conditions such as full load, the pulse width of the fuel pulse to 
the injection approaches the maximum available time between injector 
actuations. Therefore, in order to have the proper amount of fuel 
available at wide open throttle, the size of the orifice in the injector valve 
must be of such size to allow the amount of fuel determined by the pulse 
width and fuel pressure to be sufficient to operate the engine during the  
 
maximum pulse width. The disadvantage of this is that at idle and other 
low power engine conditions, the orifice size requires that the pulse width 
be very short. Very short pulse widths may be in the non-linear region of 
the fuel injector operating range. An important advantage of the present system is that it extends the 
dynamic range of the fuel supply system. The pulse width of the electrical 
signal supplied to the fuel injector at idle and other low flow conditions, 
such as deceleration, is long enough to move out of the non-linear 
operating region of the fuel injector with a given orifice size. At the same
