<DESCRIPTION>
Δ pharmaceutical composition with improved bioavailability of inositol phosphateThe present invention relates to an inositol phosphate containing pharmaceu¬ tical composition with improved bioavailability of inositol phosphate and the use of at least one nitrogen-containing compound for the preparing of an inositol phosphate containing medicament -with improved bioavailability of inositol phosphate.Hydrophilic and ionized drugs most often encounter rather poor penetration of the epithelial barriers to the capillaries of the portal circulation as most of this type of substances are transported by passive diffusion. Inositol phosphates belong to this group.Normally it is the unionized fraction of the drug that partition across the lipid membranes and this fraction is most often small over the pH-range encoun¬ tered in the gastrointestinal tract.It is known from the literature, for example Jonkman J.H.G. and Hunt CA. (1983) Pharmaceutische Weekblad Scientific Edition 5, 41-48. that a combi¬ nation of a quartemary ammonium compound and sulfonic acids are absor¬ bed to a small extent after oral administration. The absorption is described as poor and in many cases contradictory.In the literature nothing has been described about the use of counter ions such as nitrogen-containing compounds together with inositol phosphates for improvement of the bioavailability.At oral administration the properties of inositol phosphates per se result in limitations in respect of the uptake of the compounds from the intestine. In order to optimize the effect of these substances in the body it is desirable that 

as large a portion as possible of the added amount can be utilized effectively. Thereby the added amount can be reduced which is advantageous for the patient for example when the drug D-myo-inositol-l,2,6-trisphosphate QP3) is used.According to the present invention it has now quite surprisingly been possible to meet the above desire and bring about an inositol phosphate containing pharmaceutical composition which comprises a nitrogen-containing com¬ pound for improvement of the bioavailability of the inositol phosphate in mammals including man at non-parenteral administration.The expression bioavailability stands for a measurement of how large a por¬ tion of an administrated drug that occurs in the blood stream when the way of administration of the drug is non-parenteral. The term thus shows the amount of the drug that has been able to penetrate membrane barriers after for example oral administration, topical
