<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a non-volatile semiconductor memory 
device for transferring data which is inverted data of 

held data onto bit lines, without reading out read data 
to an external unit, when data is copied back. This 

device comprises NAND memory cells (2) connected to bit 
lines (BL), a flip-flop circuit (1) for temporarily 

holding write data, a P channel transistor (Q1) for 
precharging the bit lines (BL) to a predetermined 

potential, an N channel transistor (Q2) for connecting 
the bit lines (BL) to the flip-flop circuit (1), and an 

N channel transistor (Q3) having both ends connected 
between a node (5) of the flip-flop circuit (1) on the 

opposite side to the bit lines (BL) and one end of the 
transistor (Q2) on the bit line side. The transistor 

(Q3) is provided to hold read data and then output a 
potential according to its inverted data onto the bit 

lines (BL). The individual terminals of the flip-flop 
circuit (1) are connected via a column gate (3) to an 

I/O line and a BI/O line (inverted-signal line of I/O).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-volatile 
semiconductor device, and, more particularly, to a sense 
amplifier used in a writing operation and a reading 
operation. Because non-volatile semiconductor memory devices 
have advantages such as data remaining intact even powered 
off, their demand is considerably increasing 
recently. A flash memory which is an electrically erasable 
non-volatile semiconductor memory device, unlike a 
bitransistor byte type non-volatile semiconductor memory 
device, has memory cells each of which can be constituted 
of a single transistor. This design can reduce 
the size of the memory cells, so that the flash memory 
is expected to replace a large capacity magnetic disk or 
the like. Those non-volatile semiconductor memory 
devices are designed in such a manner that a memory cell 
array has memory cells arranged in a matrix form, each 
cell constituted of an MOS transistor with a floating 
gate, and stores information in the form of the threshold 
value of the MOS transistor, which can be changed by 
accumulating charges in this floating gate. Since 
information writing and erasure are executed by supplying 
a current to the insulating film of the MOS 
transistor, the writing time considerably changes 
depending on variations in the fabrication process, use 
conditions and so forth. This is a significant  
 
difference between the flash memory and a DRAM or SRAM. 
Apparently, fast writing cells and slow writing cells 
coexist in the same chip. To explain those shortcomings in detail, a NAND 
type flash memory as one example of such conventional 
non-volatile semiconductor memory devices will be discussed 
below. FIG. 1 is a circuit diagram showing the cell structure 
of a NAND type flash memory. Non-volatile memory 
cells M1 to M16 each constituted of an MOS transistor 
having a floating gate are connected in series, with one 
end of the series circuit being connected via a select 
transistor Q11 to a bit line BL while the other end is 
connected via a select transistor Q12 to a common source 
line S. The individual transistors are formed on the 
same well substrate (well region) W. The control electrodes 
of the memory cells M1-M16 are respectively connected 
to word lines WL1 to WL16, the control electrode 
of the select transistor Q11 is connected to a select 
line SL1 and the control electrode of the select transistor 
Q12 is connected to a select line SL2. The memory cells M1-M16 have threshold values corresponding 
to data they hold themselves; the threshold 
val
