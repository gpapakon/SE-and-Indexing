<ABSTRACT>
A method and system is disclosed for automatically modifying a graphic display of a diagnostic work station after detecting a probable change to a control program of a coupled programmable control station. The diagnostic work station is programmed to graphically display a representation of the various components of an attached system of automated machinery, their relationship to one another and their state (i.e., ''on'' or ''off'').

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and 
systems that monitor the operation of manufacturing 
devices and, particularly, to a method and system for 
automatically modifying the graphic display of a 
diagnostic work station upon detecting a change to 
the logic of the programmable control station being 
monitored. A substantial percentage of industrial 
manufacturing and production is accomplished through 
the use of automated machinery. This automated 
machinery is typically controlled by a programmable 
control station using a program implementing control 
logic required to perform specific tasks. Although 
the operation of such automated machinery requires 
little or no operator intervention, it is still 
useful to monitor the operation of such machinery to 
diagnose malfunctions, ensure proper maintenance and 
control quality. Typically, the operation of the 
programmable control station, and its coupled 
automated machinery, is monitored through the use of 
a diagnostic work station coupled to the programmable 
control station. In most instances, the diagnostic 
work station is programmed to display information  
 
concerning the status and operation of the coupled 
programmable control station and associated automated 
machinery. The display of the diagnostic work 
station informs operating personnel of fault 
conditions, device states, signal levels, switch 
settings and other information useful in diagnosing 
malfunctions and maintaining appropriate controls on 
the automated machinery. Often, information 
regarding the operation of the programmable control 
station and the automated machinery is presented to 
the operator of the diagnostic work station through 
a graphic display representing the logic of the 
programmable control station and/or the relationships 
between various elements of the monitored system. Although the use of a diagnostic work 
station to monitor an attached programmable control 
station has many advantages, a significant problem 
can arise when the control logic of the programmable 
control station is altered. If the programmable 
control station is placed in operation using modified 
control logic and the diagnostic work station 
monitoring the programmable control station is placed 
in operation using a monitor program which does not 
account for the modified control logic of the 
programmable control station, the information 
displayed by the diagnostic work station could be 
misleading and erroneous. The prior art has 
addressed this situation in two ways. FIGURE 1 is a
