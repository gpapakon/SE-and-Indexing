overlying at least one side of said foil, said adhesion promoting layer comprising at 

least one silane coupling agent, the base surface of said foil underlying said adhesion 
promoting layer being characterized by the absence of added surface roughening. In 

one embodiment the adhesion promoting layer is characterized by the absence of 
chromium. In one embodiment the base surface of the foil underlying the adhesion 

promoting layer is characterized by the absence of a layer of zinc or chromium 
adhered to said base surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention provides copper or copper-based alloy conductive foils having
an adhesion promoting layer overlying at least one side thereof. In one embodiment
these foils are used in the manufacture of printed circuit boards (PCBs). The invention
thus extends to (possibly etched) laminates comprising the foils and one or more layers
of non-conductive material.PCBs are components of electronic devices which are made from
laminates which comprise a conductive foil, usually copper, and a polymeric resin
substrate. The conductive foil forms the conductors in electronic devices and the
polymeric resin substrate forms an insulation between the conductors. The conductor
and insulator are in intimate contact and the adhesion between them contributes to the
performance and reliability of the electronic devices made with them.Electrodeposited and wrought or rolled copper foils used in the
manufacture of printed circuit boards do not adhere well to the polymeric substrates.
The prior practice for achieving adhesion between copper foil and insulating
polymeric substrates has been to roughen the copper surface.Surface roughening has been achieved by several means. The
electrodeposited copper foils can be electroformed with a rough surface. On top of
this rough surface further roughening is carried out by applying a high surface area
treatment. These treatments may be a copper deposited electrolytically in nodular or 
dendritic form, or a copper oxide which grows nodular or dendritic. Oft times the
rolled copper foil has mechanical roughness imparted to it during rolling or by
subsequent abrasion. The rolled foils also are conventionally treated with surface
area increasing nodular copper or copper oxide treatments.These surface roughening treatments increase adhesion to the polymers
by forming a mechanical interlock with the resin. The mechanical interlock is formed
when an adhesive in its liquid state is applied and then cured or when the resin melts
and flows prior to cure during lamination. The polymers flow around the roughened
surface area treatments to form the mechanical interlock.The surface roughening that has been used to enhance adhesion
between copper and polymeric resin substrates cause difficulties in the manufacture
of PCBs and contributes to poor PCB performance. In the subtractive copper etching
process additional etching time is required to remove the dendrites or nodules
embedded in the resin. This not only slows down the production process but
contributes to greater line loss due to the lateral
