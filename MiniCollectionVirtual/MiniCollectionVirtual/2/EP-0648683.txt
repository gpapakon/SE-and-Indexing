<ABSTRACT>
The stopper (closure) device comprises, on the one hand, a cylindrical sleeve tube (6) capable of surrounding the neck (1), this sleeve tube being mounted so that it can rotate about the neck and, on the other hand, a lid (9) articulated about a transverse axis so that it can pivot between a closed position and an open position. Fastening means (A) are provided for fastening the sleeve tube (6) and the neck (1) together to allow a relative rotational movement of the sleeve tube (6) without causing the sleeve tube to move axially with respect to the neck; the cylindrical sleeve tube (6) and the lid (9) form a single-piece cap, the lid (9) being articulated to the sleeve tube (6) by a film hinge (11); cam means (C) are provided on the neck (1) to interact with a cam follower member (20) integral with the lid (9) so that rotation of the sleeve tube (6), which drives the lid, is accompanied by a tilting movement of this lid about the transverse axis (11) from its closed position into its open position, or conversely, following the interaction of the cam means (C) of the neck and of the cam follower (20) of the lid (9).
