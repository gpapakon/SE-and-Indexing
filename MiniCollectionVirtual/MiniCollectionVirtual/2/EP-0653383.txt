<ABSTRACT>
In a process for the production of an optical fibre (11) in which the fibre (11) is drawn from one end of a preform (9) warmed to above the glass softening point at least in this region, and the preform (9) is surrounded by a stream of gas (14) whose flow direction corresponds to the fibre drawing direction, the flow of the gas surrounding the preform (9) is stabilised in the drawing region (10) by an additional flushing gas (16).

Method for producing an optical fibre (11), in which the
fibre (11) is drawn out of one end of a preform (9), which

is heated at least in this region to above the glass
softening point, while a gas flows around the preform (9),

the flow direction of which gas corresponds to the fibre
drawing direction and the flow of which above the fibre

drawing region is largely laminar, characterised in that
the flow of gas surrounding the preform (9) is stabilised

in the drawing region by an additional circulation gas.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
additional circulation gas is conveyed transversely to the

flow direction of the gas surrounding the preform (9).
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
additional circulation gas is conveyed in the direction

opposite to the flow direction of the gas surrounding the
preform (9).
Method according to claim 3, characterised in that the
additional circulation gas is initially conveyed in the

direction opposite to the flow direction of the gas
surrounding the preform (9) and deflected in the fibre

drawing direction in the drawing region (10).
Method according to claim 1 or one of the following
claims, characterised in that air, nitrogen or an inert gas

is used as the additional circulation gas.
Method according to claim 1 or one of the following
claims, characterised in that the flow speed of the

additional circulation gas is at most equal to the flow
speed of the gas stream surrounding the preform (9) in the

fibre drawing direction. 
Apparatus for carrying out the method according to claim
1 or one of the following claims, in which the preform (9)

is heated in a perpendicularly disposed drawing furnace,
whose cylindrical wall (1) surrounding the preform (9) is

heated, and means are provided for introducing a gas from
above in the fibre drawing direction, which gas flows

around the preform (9), characterised in that the
surrounding wall (1) comprises in the drawing region of the

preform (9) additional gas introduction nozzles (15),
preferably distributed over the circumference.
Apparatus for carrying out the method according to claim
1 or one of the following claims, in which the preform (9)

is heated in a perpendicularly disposed drawing furnace,
whose cylindrical wall (1) surrounding the preform (9) is

heated, and means are provided for introducing a gas from
above in the fibre drawing direction, which gas flows

around the preform (9), characterised in that a guide tube
(17) concentrically surrounding the drawn fibre (11)

projects from below into the furnace chamber (8), which
tube extends into the drawing region and the external

surface of which forms with the surrounding wall (1) of the
drawing furnace an annular gap for the additional

circulation gas.
Apparatus according to claim 8, characterised in that
the guide tube (17) consists of a material which is

resistant to high temperatures.
Apparatus according to claim 8 or 9 with an internal
graphite lining (1), which surrounds the preform (9), of

the drawing furnace, characterised in that the guide tube
(17) also consists of graphite.
