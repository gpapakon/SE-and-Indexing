<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical
insulating film treating agent for an electrical steel
sheet having a high space factor, excellent weldability
and punchability before annealing, and further having
sticking resistance at the time of annealing and
excellent corrosion resistance, lubricating property,
adhesion, etc., after annealing, and to an insulating
film treating method using the treating agent.When a non-oriented electrical steel sheet is
used for an iron core of a motor or a transformer, the
sheet is first punched out into a predetermined shape and
is then subjected to stress relief annealing. Next, a
predetermined number of such steel sheets are stacked and
then bonded by welding, caulking, bonding, etc., to form
a stacked core, as is well known in the art.Generally, an electrical insulating film is
formed on the surface of the non-oriented electrical
steel sheet. In order to obtain excellent core
characteristics and machinability, it is very important
for this insulating film to have high sticking resistance
at the time of annealing and excellent corrosion
resistance and lubricating property after annealing, in
addition to the required characteristics such as
corrosion resistance, weldability, adhesion, high space
factor, etc., besides the insulating property.Inorganic type, organic type and inorganic-organic
type insulating films are known in the past as
the electrical insulating film for the non-oriented 
electrical steel sheet. In comparison with the organic
type and organic-inorganic mixture type films, the
inorganic type insulating film has higher heat resistance
and superior lubricating property after stress relief
annealing, but its punchability is inferior. On the
other hand, the organic type insulating film has
excellent punchability and adhesion, but the film is
likely to be partially decomposed and burned out by stress
relief annealing. In other words, since adhesion after
stress relief is very low, the film cannot withstand
practical use. The inorganic-organic type film agent has
been developed in order to solve the drawbacks in the
film comprising the inorganic components alone and the
film comprising the organic components alone, and has
been used most generally at present. As an example of
the inorganic-organic mixture type insulating film,
Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku)
No. 50-15013 corresponding to DE-A-2 142 889, proposes an insulating film formation method
having excellent film characteristics such as a high
space factor, high adhesion, punchability, etc.,
