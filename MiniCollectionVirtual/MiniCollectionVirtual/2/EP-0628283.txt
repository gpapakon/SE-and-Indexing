<ABSTRACT>
In order to obtain an index which generally shows the 
work burden extent of various works ca
rried out in an 
automobile assembling factory or the like, for each work 

content, the maximum muscle contraction ratio is measured 
after the work has been continued for 5 seconds, the work 

burden index (L) is calculated from the measured ratio 
value, and the equivalent work burden in a standard work is 

calculated from the calculated work burden index (L) for 5 
seconds. The work burden index (TVAL) of actual work is 

calculated from the equivalent work burden and the actual 
work time. Suitably, a work routine plan is corrected such 

that the obtained TVAL is normalized with an apparatus 
comprising means for storing the equivalent work burden for 

each work content, means for displaying an image of the work 
content, and means for inputting work content parameter and 

so forth while watching the displayed image.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a technique of calculating an
index which permits evaluation of the extent of burden that
is borne by workers in works carried out in automobile
assembling factories and the like. The invention also
relates to a technique of evaluating burdens in irrational
and illogical work sharing or work routine on the basis of
calculated work burden index, thus permitting the planning
of more comfortable and efficient work routines.The extent of the work burden borne by the worker is
substantially dependent on two factors, i.e., the hardness
of work and the duration thereof. As a suitable index
indicative of the hardness of work, maximum muscle
contraction ratio is used. The maximum muscle contraction
ratio is obtained by measuring slight potential generated in
the muscle when the muscle shrinks, and it is the ratio of
the potential during work to the potential at the time of
the maximum shrinkage of the muscle. It can be measured
electrically and objectively. It is well known in the art that when the maximum
muscle contraction ratio M is used to indicate the hardness
of work, the extent of burden that is imposed on the worker
can be well represented by the work burden index L given in
the following equation (1) (Kogi & Hakamada "Slowing of
Surface Electromyogram and Muscle Strength in Muscle
Fatigue", Rep. Inst. Labor, 60, p-p. 27-41, 1962, Sato,
Katsuura, Sato, Tochihara, Yokoyama et al "Human Engineering
Basic Numerical Value Formulas Manual", p-p. 223-224, 1992,
Gihodo Shuppan).
L = C1 log t + C2 log M - 48.06
where L is the index which is also called the living body
burden extent and well corresponds to the extent of burden
felt by the worker, and t is the duration of work.It is confirmed that C1 and C2 in equation (1) are
constants, and it is also well known that C1 and C2 are
C1 = 27.03 and C2 = 53.78
It is further confirmed that equations (1) and (2) hold
independently of the kind of muscle, the worker's position,
etc. ("Human Engineering Basic Numerical Value Formulas
Manual" noted above, Endo "Evaluation of Static Muscular
Fatigue", Japanese Journal of Human Engineering, Vol. 17,
No. 3, p-p. 123-127, 1981). Furthermore, equations (1)
and (2) hold independently of the kind of work or work
content. The work burden index is obtainable by equations (1)
and (2), if the maximum muscle contraction ratio M is not
changed during work. However, in long works such as
automobile assembling works, the maximum muscle contraction
ratio M is changed during the work. In usual works, the
work
