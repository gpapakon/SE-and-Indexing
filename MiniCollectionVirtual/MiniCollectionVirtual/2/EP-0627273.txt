<ABSTRACT>
A press tool (91, 92) for connecting tubular workpieces (101, 108) has more than two pressing jaws (94, 95, 110, 111) and these can be moved relative to one another in such a way with the aid of at least one driving device (103) that they can be moved out of an open position, in which the press tool can be placed on the workpiece (101, 108), into a pressing position, in which the pressing jaws (94, 95, 110, 111) complement one another to form a closed pressing space. According to the invention, the pressing jaws (94, 95, 110, 111) are connected to one another in a jointed manner to form a pressing ring (93, 109), the pressing ring (93, 109) being open between two pressing jaws (95, 111) and being closable by means of the driving device(s) (103) thereby being drawn together.

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing a pipe joint in which tubular workpieces (101, 108), namely
a coupling workpiece (101) and a pipe end (108) in each case, are joined by plastic

deformation in a radial direction by means of a press tool (91, 92) comprising more
than two pressing jaws (94, 95, 110, 111), which pressing jaws are joined hinged to

each other with the formation of a pressing ring (93, 109) and which can be moved
substantially radially inwards by means of at least one drive device (103), wherein

the pressing ring (93, 109) with the pressing jaws (94, 95, 110, 111) is placed
round the workpieces (101, 108) for the pressing operation and is then closed,

characterised in that a pressing ring (93, 109) is used which after being placed
around the workpieces (101, 108) firstly does not completely surround the latter,

and that pressing and plastic deformation are then effected by the closure of the
pressing ring (93, 109) by means of the drive device(s) (103).
A combination of a press tool (91, 92) on the one hand and of a coupling workpiece
(101) and a pipe end (108) as workpieces (101, 108) on the other hand for carrying

out the method according to claim 1, having more than two pressing jaws (94, 95,
110, 111) which are joined hinged to each other with the formation of a pressing

ring (93, 109) and which can be moved substantially radially inwards by means of
at least one drive device (103), wherein the pressing ring (93, 109) can be placed

round the workpieces (101, 108) and can then be closed for the pressing operation,
characterised in that the geometries of the pressing ring (93, 109) and of the

workpieces (101, 108) are matched to each other in such a way that on the one hand
the workpieces (101, 108) cannot be completely surrounded by the pressing ring

(93, 109) after the latter has been placed round them and on the other hand a
pressing operation comprising plastic deformation can be effected by the closure of

the pressing ring (93, 109), and that the at least one drive device (103) is 
constructed so that the pressing ring (93, 109) can be moved by it from its position

after being placed round the workpieces (101, 108) into its closed position.
A combination according to claim 2, characterised in that at least one part of the
pressing jaws (94, 95; 111) is guided in pressing jaw supports (97; 113) so that it

can move in relation thereto.
A combination according to claim 3, characterised in that guide devices are
provided for the movable pressing jaws (95; 111), of a form such that the spacings

between the end faces of the movable pressing jaws are equal at the start of the
pressing operation.
A combination according to claim 4, characterised in that guide devices comprise a
connecting link guide.
A combination according to claim 5, characterised in that the guide devices
comprise a spring action (98; 115 to 117) which is oriented towards stops.
A combination according to any one of claims 2 to 6, characterised in that the drive
device(s) (103) acts or act at the free end of the pressing ring (93, 109).
A combination according to any one of claims 2 to 7, characterised in that the drive
device(s) (103) can be separated from the pressing ring (93, 106), and the drive

device(s) (103) and the pressing ring (93, 109) comprise coupling elements (102,
105, 118) via which they can be brought into active communication.
A combination according to any one of claims 2 to 8, characterised in that the
pressing ring (93) comprises at least one tension band (97), which is seated against

the outside of the movable pressing jaw (95) at least and via which the pressing jaws
(94, 95) can be moved together. 
A combination according to claim 9, characterised in that two tension bands (97)
are provided which can be drawn together in the region of the free ends of the

pressing ring (93).
A combination according to any one of claims 2 to 10, characterised in that the
pressing jaws (94, 95, 110, 111) are constructed so that they are of the same length

in the peripheral direction.
