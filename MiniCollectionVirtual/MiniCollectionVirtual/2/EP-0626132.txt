<ABSTRACT>
A self-closing feeding rack for cattle, comprising a top 
girder (1) substantially horizontal in the service position, a bottom 

girder (2) extending parallel to the top girder, and a plurality of 
fixed uprights (3,4) connecting the top and bottom girders with each 

other, there being further provided a plurality of catch uprights (6) 
pivoting between an open position and a catch position, which, 

together with a fixed upright (7), each form an eating opening, as 
well as locking means for the catch uprights and operating means 

for the locking means, the operating means comprising a slidable 
operating section (18), the locking means being attached to one of the 

girders, which girder is designed as a hollow section girder

extend into the section girder for cooperation with the locking 

means, wherein
 

   the locking means comprise a plurality of locking elements (12)

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a self-closing feeding 
rack for cattle, comprising a top girder substantially 
horizontal in the service position, a bottom girder extending 
parallel to the top girder, and a plurality of fixed 
uprights connecting the top and bottom girders with each 
other, there being further provided a plurality of catch 
uprights adapted for pivotal motion between an open position 
and a catch position, which, together with a fixed upright, 
each form an eating opening, as well as locking means 
for the catch uprights and operating means for the locking 
means, the operating means comprising a slidable operating 
section, the locking means being attached to one of the 
girders, which girder is designed as a hollow section 
girder provided with at least one longitudinal slot via 
which the ends of the catch uprights proximal to the 
relevant section girder extend into the section girder 
for cooperation with the locking means. Such a feeding 
rack is disclosed in Dutch patent 183796. In the known feeding rack, the top girder includes 
an operating strip extending throughout the length of 
the top girder, this operating strip being slidable in 
longitudinal direction at least along the inside of one 
of the sidewalls of the top girder. At the location 
of each catch upright, the operating strip comprises 
a lift cam and a slide-off cam spaced therefrom. Through 
sliding displacement of the operating strip, at each 
catch upright the position of a pawl arranged around 
the top end of the catch upright can be changed, in such 
a manner that the catch uprights can be locked, cocked 
or released. Each pawl is provided with a cam projecting 
under the top girder, serving to release each catch upright 
separately. During assembly of the known feeding rack, the 
pawls and operating strip are slid into the top girder, 
whereafter the catch uprights should be properly inserted 
in the respective pawls from below through openings in 
the underside of the top girder. For repairing or servicing 
for instance the pawls or the operating strip, the operating  
 
strip should be slid out of the top girder in the longitudinal 
direction. However, the required room for this is not 
always present. Moreover, an animal could get injured through the 
projecting cam or catch its collar or ear mark on such 
a cam. It might also happen that an animal that is locked 
in the eating opening releases a blocked catch upright 
by means of the cam. German Offenlegungsschrift 4017394 discloses a 
self-closing feeding rack
