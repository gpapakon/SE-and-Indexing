<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a switching assembly 
for hand tools, comprising a tool holding fixture connected 
with a power source, wherein the power source is switched 
depending upon whether a manual device or hand tool has 
been deposited in the tool holding fixture. The invention 
relates, in particular, to a switching arrangement for a 
manual soldering device, wherein the manual soldering 
device and a solder vapour suction arrangement, possibly 
connected therewith, or other work units are turned off 
automatically when the manual soldering device is deposited 
in the tool holding fixture. With the switching devices of this type which are 
known so far, an electrical switch is provided in the tool 
holding fixture and, when the hand tool is deposited, it is 
operated by the pressure of the device housing. The switch 
controls the power supply of the deposited manual device so 
that the power supply is interrupted when the manual device 
is located in the tool holding fixture and that the power 
supply is established when the tool holding fixture is 
empty. The switch integrated in the tool holding fixture 
is subsequently electrically connected to the power source 
of the device via appropriate lines. The disadvantage of this state of the art is that the 
tool holding fixture must meet the increased safety 
regulations for electrically connected devices, since the 
integrated switch is under constant electrical voltage 
during operation of the device. In the same way, the 
switch itself must meet the necessary requirements in such 
a way that, on the one hand, the safe turning off is 
assured when the manual device is deposited and, on the 
other hand, a disturbance-free operation of the manual 
device is possible upon removal from the fixture. For 
example, a loose connection in the integrated switch would 
not only render the switching devices known so far 
unusable, but could endanger the operator when the manual  
 
device inadvertently continues to run inside the tool 
holding fixture. The object of the present invention lies in overcoming 
these disadvantages of the state of the art, and in 
particular to provide a switching device for a hand tool 
which assures safe control of a power supply, depending on 
whether the tool holding fixture is free or occupied, while 
the tool holding fixture itself has no elements whatsoever 
which carry an electrical voltage. According to the present invention a switching device 
for a hand tool comprises a tool holding fixture and a 
power supply

<CLAIMS>
A switching assembly for a hand tool, the assembly 
comprising a tool holding fixture (1) and a power supply 

device (3), characterized in that the tool holding fixture 
(1) is connected to the power supply device (3) via an 

optical fibre (2); and there are means (3) for switching 
the power supply device in response to changes in the light 

transmitted along the fibre. 
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein the power 
supply arrangement (3) controls the power supply of the 

hand tool (5) for which the tool holding fixture is 
provided. 
An assembly according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein 
the tool holding fixture (1) is arranged to cooperate with 

the hand tool (5) in such a way, that the intensity of the 
light conducted from the tool holding fixture via the 

optical fibre (2) towards the power supply device (3), is 
reduced when the hand tool (5) is deposited in t
he tool 
holding fixture (1). 
A assembly according to claim 3, wherein one end of 
the optical fibre, extending into the tool holding fixture, 

is covered by the hand tool when placed into the tool 
holding fixture (1). 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the power supply device (3) comprises a 

plug-in charger having a circuit (3a) and a switching 
element (3c), which are electrically connected to a power 

source. 
An assembly according to claim 5, wherein the circuit 
(3a) contains a photoelement which is situated at the other 

end of the optical fibre (2), so that the circuit (3a) 
 

emits an "ON" signal when the light intensity from the 
optical fibre (2) drops below a lower threshold value and 

emits an "OFF" signal when the light intensity exceeds an 
upper threshold value. 
An assembly according to claim 6, wherein the output 
signal of the circuit (3a) is applied to the switching 

element (3c), which controls a connected power source in 
accordance with the signal. 
An assembly according to claim 7, wherein the circuit 
(3a) and the switching element (3c) are connected via a 

time element (3b) which directs the output signal from the 
circuit (3a) to the switching element (3c) only after a 

certain delay time (t). 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the power supply device (3), controls at 

least one additional device in addition to the hand tool 
(5), depending on the light intensity inside the optical 

fibre (2). 
An assembly according to claim 9, wherein the 
additional device(s) includes a pump (4) and/or a 

magnetically operated valve (6).
