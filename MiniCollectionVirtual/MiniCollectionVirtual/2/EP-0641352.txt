<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation of United 
States application Serial No. 08/021,072 filed 
23 February 1993. This invention was made with government support 
under Grant No. GM 41336 awarded by the National 
Institutes of Health. The government has certain 
rights in the invention. This invention relates to the synthesis of 
5-fluoro,2'-deoxycytidine, of oligonucleotides that 
contain 5-fluoro,2'-deoxycytidine, and of certain 
novel 4-alkoxy,5-fluoro,2'-deoxyuridines. The 
invention also relates to antitumor agents which 
comprise such compounds. The 5-fluoropyrimidines comprise an important 
class of antitumor compounds. One derivative of this 
class, 5-fluoro,2'-deoxycytidine (FdC) is known to 
have potent1-51/ and selective6-8 cytostatic 
properties. It has been established that FdC can be 
kinased and deaminated to FdUMP via two distinct 
metabolic pathways resulting in the inhibition of 
thymidylate synthase9. Due to the increased activity 
of both cytidine and deoxycytidine deaminases present 
in many human tumor cells, it has been proposed that 
FdC might have superior properties as an antitumor 
agent in man8. FdC was first synthesized by Fox et al., via 
aminolysis of 4-thio,5-fluoro,2'-deoxyuridine14. FdC 
has also been prepared by coupling the fluorinated 
pyrimidine with a suitably derivatized deoxyribose15.  
 
Both of these procedures have the disadvantages of 
modest yield and complexity of products. Robins et 
al. have presented a method for direct fluorination 
of deoxycytidine16. While FdC was provided in high 
yield with few side products, the required 
fluorination reagents are potentially toxic and 
explosive. Accordingly, one aspect of the invention 
comprises a novel method to provide FdC in high yield 
under mild conditions. It is also known that FdC has important 
biochemical properties unrelated to the inhibition of 
thymidylate synthetase. FdC can induce cellular 
differentation10 and cause dramatic decreases in DNA 
5-methylcytosine levels10,11. FdC is incorporated 
into cellular DNA and it has been shown that the 
level of FdC incorporation is proportional to 
cytotoxicity11. Recently, interest in FdC has been 
renewed as it has been shown that oligonucleotides 
containing FdC are potent mechanism based inhibitors 
of both procaryotic12 and eucaryotic13 DNA 
(cytosine-5) methyltransferases. Physical and biochemical studies aimed at 
elucidation of the mechanisms which explain the 
biological properties of FdC require methods for 
synthesis of FdC in oligonucleotides at
