<ABSTRACT>
Method for extracting a signal indicating the load state of a power switch component (6) arranged between a load (2) and an alternating electrical power supply source (N, P), the method using a power supply by auxiliary power supply means (13). The method comprises the following stages:   - a stage of extracting a signal representing the voltage at the terminals of the switching component (6) and - a stage of shaping the said extracted signal in order to deliver a signal (S) able to be processed subsequently, this shaping stage using the auxiliary power supply (13).   These stages of extracting and of shaping are functional whatever the state of the load (2). Application in domestic electronics, particularly in association with electrical energy methods and procedures.
