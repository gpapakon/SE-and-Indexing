<ABSTRACT>
This invention includes a first step for 
dipping etched aluminium foil into pure water of high 

temperature for a predetermined period of time, a second 
step for dipping the aluminium foil into an aqueous 

solution containing an organic acid and at least one 
kind of a salt thereof after the first step, and a third 

step for subjecting the aluminium foil to a forming 
treatment in an electrolytic solution after the second 

step, wherein either straight saturated dicarboxylic 
acid having an odd number of carbons or trans-straight 

unsaturated dicarboxylic acid is used or organic acid 
having an aromatic ring and a carboxyl group is used as 

the organic acid in the second step, whereby leakage 
current characteristics are improved by weakening a 

dissolving action to a hydrated film and strengthening a 
bonding action to the hydrated film.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
manufacturing anode foil for aluminium electrolytic
capacitors, and more specifically, to a method of
manufacturing anode foil for aluminium electrolytic
capacitors by which the leakage current characteristics
of the anode foil at medium and high voltages are
improved.Recently, as electronic appliance sets are
miniaturized and their reliability is increased, the
requirements for the miniaturization and improvement of
reliability of aluminium electrolytic capacitors are
rapidly increasing. Therefore, the capacitance and
leakage current characteristics of anode foil for
aluminium electrolytic capacitors (hereinafter, referred
to as anode foil) must be improved.Conventionally, as disclosed in Japanese
Patent Unexamined Publication No. Sho 59-89796, there is
proposed a method of manufacturing aluminium foil for
electrolytic capacitors as a method of manufacturing
anode foil for medium and high voltage usage and this
method comprises a first step for boiling aluminium foil 
with pure water, a second step for dipping the aluminium soil
into a weak acid solution after the first step and a third
step for subjecting the aluminium foil to a forming treatment
after the second step.Nevertheless, this conventional method for manufacturing
anode foil is disadvantageous in that since weak acid is
bonded with a hydrated film produced by the boiling with the
pure water as well as the weak acid dissolves the hydrated
film, the forming film formed at the next step is made more
defective and leakage current characteristics are made insufficient
by it.JP-A-40 196 304 discloses a method of manufacturing an
anode foil comprising: boiling an etched aluminium foil in
pure water and thereafter subjecting it to a forming treatment
in a solution containing 0.5 to 10 wt% boric acid and 0.002 to
1.0 wt% glutaric acid. JP-A-60 065 517 proposes a method of
manufacturing an anode foil comprising boiling an aluminium
foil in pure water, dipping it in an aqueous solution containing
e.g. fumaric acid or a salt thereof and thereafter
subjecting it to a forming treatment in an aqueous solution
containing a phosphoric acid or salts thereof. JP-A-02 216 811
proposes a method of manufacturing an anode foil comprising:
boiling an aluminium foil in hot water containing an amine and
an acid, e.g. benzoic acid, and subjecting the thus pretreated
aluminium foil to a forming treatment.An object of the present invention for solving the
conventional problem is to provide a method for manufacturing
anode
