<ABSTRACT>
A system for controlling an air-fuel ratio of 
an air-fuel mixture supplied to each cylinder of a multicylinder 

internal combustion engine. A first feedback loop is 
provided for converging a first air-fuel ratio at a location 

at least either at or downstream of a confluence point of an 
exhaust system to a first desired air-fuel ratio by multiplying 

a first feedback gain to a first error therebetween. 
And a second feedback loop is provided in the first loop for 

converging a second current air-fuel ratio at each cylinder 
to a second desired air-fuel ratio by multiplying a second 

feedback gain to a second error. The first feedback loop 
and said second feedback loop are connected in series such 

that the second loop located inside the first loop. With 
the arrangement. the second loop operates the second air-fuel 

ratio converges to converge the second air-fuel ratio 
to the first air-fuel ratio which in turn tends to converge 

on the first desired air-fuel ratio such that the air-fuel 
ratios of all cylinders can therefore be converged on the 

desired air-fuel ratio.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an air-fuel ratio
feedback control system for an internal combustion engine,
more particularly to an air-fuel ratio feedback control
system adapted for use in a multiple cylinder internal
combustion engine for absorbing variance in air-fuel ratio
between cylinders and converging the air-fuel ratio in each
cylinder on a desired value with high accuracy.It is a common practice to install an air-fuel
ratio sensor in the exhaust system of an internal
combustion engine and feedback-control the value detected by
the sensor for regulating the amount of fuel supplied to a
desired value. A system of this type is taught by Japanese
Laid-open Patent Publication No. Sho 59-101562, for example.When a single air-fuel ratio sensor is installed
at an exhaust gas confluence point of the exhaust
system of a multiple cylinder internal combustion engine
with four, six or more cylinders, however, the output of the
sensor represents a mixture of the values at all of the
cylinders. Since the air-fuel ratios at the individual
cylinders cannot be detected with high accuracy, therefore,
they cannot be precisely controlled. As a result, the air-fuel
mixture becomes lean at some cylinders and rich at 
others, and the quality of the exhaust emissions is degraded.
While this problem can be overcome by installing a
separate sensor for each cylinder, this increases costs to
an unacceptable level and also gives rise to a problem
regarding durability. In light of these circumstances, the
applicant earlier proposed designing a model describing the
exhaust system behavior, inputting the output of a single
air-fuel ratio sensor disposed at the exhaust system confluence
point to the model, and constructing an observer for
estimating the air-fuel ratios at the individual cylinders.
(Japanese Patent Application No. Hei 3-359338; Japanese
Laid-open Patent Publication No. Hei 5-180040 which was
filed in the United States under the number of 07/997,769
and in EPO under the number of 92311841.8)It was found, however, that when the estimated
values obtained in this manner are to be used for absorbing
variance in air-fuel ratio between cylinders and converging
the air-fuel ratio in each cylinder on a desired
value with high accuracy, a problem arises regarding how the
feedback gain (correction term or correction coefficient)
should be set. For overcoming this problem, there is proposed
conducting air-fuel ratio control by setting separate
feedback gains for the individual cylinders and for all of
the cylinders (confluence
