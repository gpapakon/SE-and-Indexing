<ABSTRACT>
In key-lock systems, in which data and power are transmitted via a single coil pair, the data transmission from the key to the lock is modulated by phase modulation rather than by load. Instead of modulating the effective resistance on the key side, a reactance is modulated according to the invention. This can be done, for example, by inserting capacitances in the resonant circuit on the key side.
