<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of 
organic chemistry. The invention provides novel 
tetrahydro-beta-carboline compounds and intermediates with 
a high affinity for the 5-HT1c receptor. Additionally, the 
invention provides 7-substituted tryptamine compounds with 
5HT2A, 5HT2B, and/or 5HT2C receptor activity. A substantial body of evidence supports the 
relationship between 5-HT1c receptor modulation and a 
variety of diseases and conditions. The 5HT1C receptor has 
recently been designated as the 5HT2C receptor by 
researchers in this field. Hoyer, Pharmacological Reviews 
(draft document sanctioned by IUPHAR Receptor Nomenclature 
and Drug Classification Committee; July 7, 1993). As used 
herein, the 5-HT1C receptor shall refer to the receptor now 
designated as 5HT2C. The 5-HT1c receptor subtype was first detected 
in choroid plexus epithelial cells and is the only 5HT 
receptor subtype expressed by these cells. Studies of the 
5-HT1c receptor using radioligand binding have been complex 
due to the cross reactivity of the 5-HT1c receptor with the 
5-HT₂ receptor. The discovery of selective, high affinity  
 
compounds which discriminate between 5-HT1c and 5-HT₂ has 
been an elusive and important target. Hartig et al., The 
5-HT1cReceptorAnnals New York Academy of Science, 149, 
159. Compounds with selective affinity for the 5-HT1c 
receptor can provide treatment for 5-HT1c-receptor-mediated 
conditions without the side effects associated with 
activity at the 5-HT₂ receptor. Such compounds can 
simplify characterization of the 5-HT1c receptor and 
provide useful new therapeutic agents. In vitro, m-chlorophenylpiperazine 
(m-CPP) has a slightly higher 
affinity for the 5-HT1c sites than for other 5-HT 
receptors; however, prior to the present invention, there 
have been no known 5-HT1c selective ligands. The activation of the 5-HT1c receptor has been 
associated with numerous behavioral and physiological 
effects. TiPS, 11, 181 (May 1990). The 5HT1c receptors in 
the limbic system can affect mood, behavior, and 
hallucinogenesis. Hartig et al., The 5-HT1cReceptorAnnals New York Academy of Science, 149, 159. Modulation 
of the 5HT1C receptors has been associated with 
schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorders. Ugedo, L. 
et. al.Psychopharmacology, 98, 45 (1989); Canton H. et. 
al.Eur. J. Pharmacol., 191, 93 (1990). Hypothalamic 5-HT1c 
receptors can influence sleep, appetite, 
thermoregulation, sexual behavior, motor activity, and 
neuroendocrine function. Hartig et al., The
