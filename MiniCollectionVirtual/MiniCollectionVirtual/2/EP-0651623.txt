<ABSTRACT>
Instead of preparing the elastic rings and tool separately for the treatment, the tool of this invention can hold a number of elastic rings behind the head. When needed, an elastic ring can be pushed to the head of the tool and fixed by the indented portion of the head. Then, the elastic ring can be fastened to the bracket by the same procedure as with the traditional tools. Also, it provides a simpler way to fix the position of the elastic ring at the head of the tool. Thus, it prevents unnecessary waste of the elastic rings during the elastic ring placement at the head. The tool is designed to be disposable so that it can eliminate hygienic problem which may be caused by the repeated use of the traditional plier-type tools.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tool for fastening 
elastic rings to brackets 
for orthodontic treatment. Prior art apparatus for the 
orthodontic treatment can be explained by reference to 
FIGS. 1, 5 and 6. First, the back plate (3) of a H-shaped 
bracket (1) having a groove (2) is attached to the center 
of the tooth for the treatment. An archwire (5) is then 
inserted to the grooves (2) of the brackets (1) which have 
been attached to two teeth (4)(4'). The elastic ring (6) is 
fastened to the upper and lower part (1')(1'') of the H-shaped 
bracket (1) to fix the archwire (5). Then, the 
both ends of the archwire (5) are bent to achieve the 
desired position of the teeth (4)(4'). One of the traditional methods for fastening the 
elastic rings to the bracket can be explained by the FIG. 
5. The elastic rings (6) are kept at the body of holder 
(7). Then, the elastic rings are separated one by one 
using a plier-type tool (not shown in the FIG. 5) and 
fastened to the upper and lower part (1')(1'') of the 
bracket (1). The other method is shown in FIGS. 6(a) and 
(b). In this method, a number of elastic rings (6) are 
kept at a wire holder (8) as in FIG. 6(a). Each elastic 
ring is separated from the wire holder using a tool (10) 
having a U-shaped curvature (9). The tool is shown in 
FIG. 6(b). (The procedure for fastening with this tool is 
the same as with the tool of the invention and will be 
described in details later).  
 In the method of FIG. 5, a plier-type tool is 
put into the ring and opened so that the expanded ring can 
be fastened to the upper and lower part (1')(1'') of the 
bracket (1). Therefore, the plier-type tool needs to be 
positioned perpendicular to the teeth (4)(4'). Thus, in 
case of a molar tooth, the mouth of a patient is forced to 
be opened wide to the side. This disadvantage also applies 
to the orthodontic instrument disclosed in US-A-4,277,236 being additionally 
rather complicated. Furthermore, in the method of FIG. 6(a) and (b), 
the procedure to separate an elastic ring (6) from the 
wire holder and to place at the bent portion (9) of the 
tool (10) is not trivial. Due to the elasticity of the 
ring (6), a number of elastic rings are often wasted 
during this procedure. Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide a tool for 
fastening elastic rings to brackets for orthodontic treatment solving 
the above-identified problem. This object is achieved by a tool according to claim 1. The tool of the invention eliminates 
the need of a separate holder because the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A tool (18) for fastening an elastic ring (16) to a 
bracket (1) for orthodontic treatment, the tool (18) consisting of: 


(a) a U-shaped head (11) made by 
bending a center of a wire, 
(b) an indented portion (12)(12') at the head (11) to 
fix the position of the elastic ring (16), 
(c) side bars (13)(13') gradually narrowing 
down to form slanted portions (14)(14'), 
(d) a portion of the two wire side bars (13)(13') meeting together 
(15) to hold a number of elastic rings (16), and 
(e) ends (17) of the two wire side bars (13)(13') being bent 
to keep the elastic rings (16) inside the tool (18). 
The tool according to claim 1, wherein 
a concave portion (20) is formed at the head (11) of the tool (18) instead 

of the indented portion (12)(12').
