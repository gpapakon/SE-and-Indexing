<CLAIMS>
A combination of active ingredients for inhibiting or controlling 
the nitration of culturing soils or substrates, characterized by 

the fact that said combination contains a compound having the 
general composition depicted in Formula I, 


 
where 


M
represents various univalent or multivalent metallic ions, 
preferentially of the alkaline-earth metals, Fe, Zn, Ni, Co, 

Mn, Cu, Cr, Mo, or Al, and n = 1 and greater in the case of 
coordination compounds, but is to be voided by setting n = 0 

in the case of metallic salts of substituted pyrazoles, 
A
might represent the complementary ion, preferentially ammonium 
or an alkali or alkaline-earth metal, in the case of 

anionic complexes and pyrazolates, but might also represent 
the 3-methylpyrazolium cation in the case of anionic complexes 

Fe or Al in the case of metallic salts, and b is an 
integer ranging from 0 to 4, 
X
might represent identical or differing anions or various 
univalent or multivalent inorganic or organic anions, such 

as acetate, nitrate, sulfate, halide, or thiocyanate anions, 
and q is an integer ranging from 0 to 6, 
R
1
represents either hydrogen or methyl or halogen radicals, 
Z
represents hydrogen, CONH
2
, CNHNH
2
, or CSNH
2
, but has no 
significance in the case of pyrazolates, and 
s
is an integer from 1 to 6, 
  
 

and dicyanodiamide, as depicted in Formula II, 

 
in mixing ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:400, preferentially in 

mixing ratios ranging from 1:10 to 1:100. 
A combination of active ingredients per Claim 1, characterized by 
the fact that said active ingredients of said combination are 

applied alone or in conjunction with solid or liquid mineral or 
organic fertilizers containing urea and/or ammonia and/or ammonium 

nitrate in the form of solid or liquid concentrates, or as an 
admixture with a powdered or granular solid base material. 
A combination of active ingredients per Claim 1, characterized by 
the fact that said combination is applied prior to, in conjunction 

with, or subsequent to the application of fertilizer. 
A combination of active ingredients per Claims 1 and 2, characterized 
by the fact that said combination is applied in conjunction 

with other agrochemicals and/or with the conduct of other 
agricultural measures. 
A combination of active ingredients per Claims 1 through 4, characterized 
by the fact that said combination is applied in dosages 

of 0.2 to 50 kg of said active ingredients per hectare, preferentially 
in dosages of 0.5 to 20 kg of same per hectare. 
A combination of active ingredients per Claims 1 through 4, characterized 
by the fact that said combination is added to fertilizers 

in percentages of 0.1 to 50 percent by weight, preferentially, 
however, in percentages of 1 to 30 percent by weight relative 

to their nitrogen contents.
