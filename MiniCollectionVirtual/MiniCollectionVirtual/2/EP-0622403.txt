<ABSTRACT>
Solid waste materials comprising oxidatively-cured, 
solid polysulfide sealants containing spent oxidant, 

fillers, plasticizers, and other formulating aids are 
reverted to a liquid sealant comprising mercaptan-terminated 

polysulfides by reducing them with a liquid 
mercaptan-terminated polysulfide at temperatures ranging 

from 50 to 110°C. Upon the addition of fresh curing agent 
and recuring, the reclaimed sealant has satisfactory 

tensile strength and elongation properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the reclamation of cured polysulfide 
sealants. More particularly, it relates to the reversion of the 
cured sealant to the liquid polysulfide and the recycling of the 
product. Still more particularly, it relates to the reduction of 
the cured polysulfide by heating it with a mercaptan-terminated 
liquid polysulfide. More than 95 % of all polysulfide polymers are made by the 
reaction of sodium polysulfide with bis(chloroethyl) formal and 
small proportions of 1,2,3-trichloropropane, which provides 
branching sites for crosslinking during a subsequent curing step. 
In general, the principal reactions that take place may be 
summarized by the equations: 
n Na₂Sx + ClRCl → 2n NaCl + -(-RSSRSSRSSRSSRSSR-)n--(-RSSRSSRSSRSSRSSR-)n- 
+ NaSH + Na₂SO₃ → HS-(R-SS-)n-R-SH 
+ NaOH + Na₂S₂O₃ wherein n is from about 5 to about 70.The preparation of the polysulfides is described by E.R. 
Bertozzi in Macromolecular Syntheses, p.35, Vol. 7, E.M. Fettes, 
ed., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, (1979). Solid polysulfide elastomers having terminal thiol groups and 
a molecular weight of about 80,000 (n is from about 300 to 1000) 
may be cured by oxidation to give products used in printing rolls, 
paint-spray hose, solvent hose, gaskets, and gas meter diaphragms. 
Liquid polysulfide polymers, on the other hand, also have terminal  
 
thiol groups but their molecular weight is much lower, i.e. from 
about 400 to about 8000 (n is from about 6 to 50). These liquid 
polysulfides are cured in place at the site of their use, which is 
mainly as sealants for double-pane insulating windows, in other 
building construction, for boat hulls and decks, for aircraft 
integral fuel tanks, and in aircraft construction. Waste material comprising scraps of cured polysulfide sealants 
generated by large scale applicators of aircraft, window, and 
industrial grade sealants is fast losing a place to be dumped. 
The cost of landfill cells is continuously escalating. Some 
landfill operators are beginning to refuse such sealants because of 
their heavy metal content. Manufacturers of the liquid 
polysulfides that are precursors to the cured sealants are 
beginning to search for ways to alleviate the disposal problems 
faced by their customers. Hydrogen sulfide at rather low concentrations is known to 
attack cured polysulfides and cause the surface to soften. 
Hydrogen sulfide is, however, a very dangerous poisonous gas. It 
would be preferable, moreover, to cause the cured material to 
change into a liquid usable
