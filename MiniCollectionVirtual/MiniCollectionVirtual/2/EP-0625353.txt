<DESCRIPTION>
Slow-release pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration
are amply documented in scientific and patent literature.For example, US patent No. 2,918,411 discloses a pharmaceutical
composition for oral administration essentially comprising a
multiplicity of minute pellets consisting of (a)
polyvinylpyrrolidone, (b) a water soluble agent melting at 45°C min.
selected among saturated fatty acids, esters of saturated fatty
acids of mono-, di-, and trihydric alcohols, mono- and polyesters of
saturated fatty acids, saturated aliphatic ketones, and
pharmaceutically acceptable sterols, and (c) a drug.US Patent No. 4,572,833 discloses a controlled release pharmaceutical
composition for oral administration wherein potassium chloride
microgranules are coated with a membrane comprising a solvent, a
film-forming substance dissolved in said solvent, and a hydrophobic
substance microdispersed in said film-forming mixture.The use of bile acids for humans' cholesterol-oversaturated
lithogenous bile desaturation and biliary calculi lysis is well
known. Among them, particularly preferred are the chenodeoxycholic,
ursodeoxycholic and tauroursodeoxycholic acids.However, to bring about the desired beneficial effects, the therapy
based on said acids requires regular, long-lasting treatments (from
6 months to 2 years). This is one reason why efforts have been made to secure the
patient's compliance, who, being often asymptomatic, does not feel
inclined regularly to take medicines.On the basis of the results obtained from clinical trials,
ursodeoxycholic acid was in several cases administered at a single
evening dose instead of multiple doses, the daily dose being 10
mg/kg/die.However, said single evening dose, undoubtedly more practical, must
be enough to secure antilithogenous protection for the whole day.Calculi formation, if any, especially takes place during the periods
of fasting within the span of the day, i.e. during night-time and
during the hours preceding lunch.This is another reason supporting administration in the evening.Slow release pharmaceutical formulations based on ursodeoxycholic
acid are already available.For example, Lehner's US patent No. 4,263,272 discloses and claims a
composition that may be provided in two pharmaceutical forms, i.e.:
a) a solid unit dosage form comprising tablets or pills made up from
several concentric layers.
In a typical embodiment, said solid unit dosage form consists of:
a core obtained by compression and containing a bile acid, starch,
microgranular cellulose,
