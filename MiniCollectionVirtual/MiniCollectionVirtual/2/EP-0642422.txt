<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for laminating a sheet of printed matter (2) to a plastics sheet (1) comprising removing a small portion (4) of an adhesive protecting cover sheet (3) from the plastics sheet (1), adhering a portion of the sheet of printed matter (2) to the exposed plastics sheet (1), removing the remainder of the cover sheet (3) from the plastics sheet (1) and then adhering the plastics sheet and the printed matter sheet together using apparatus comprising two rollers and a guard for separating the sheets prior to combining the sheets between the rollers.

<DESCRIPTION>
"METHOD OF COLD LAMINATING RIGID PLASTICS AND STATIONERY AND APPARATUS THEREFOR"This invention relates to a method of manufacture of signs, Registration Plates and other articles where it is desired to combine printed matter with a rigid plastics sheet.It is often required to combine printed matter with a plastics sheets or covering for the purposes of improving aesthetic appearance and protecting the printed matter from tearing, dampness, spoiling and the like. The addition of a plastics component is often useful for preserving printed matter and improving the presentation thereof.In the past it has been known to provide a plastics flexible sheet for encapsulating printed matter. A sheet of printed matter would be placed within a plastics wallet made from an adhesive sheet which is heat activated. While this process has been found useful in certain applications, there are a number of commercial situations where problems may arise with the use of this process. For example, some printing 

techniques involve the application of heat for the production of letters or symbols on heat sensitive paper or board and thus the further application of heat when laminating or encapsulating the printed matter in a plastics material generally causes complications. It is also more desirable on occasions to laminate the printed matter rather than encapsulate it, and to use rigid sheeting rather than a flexible plastics material.Methods used for combining a rigid plastics sheet with printed matter have also been associated with problems in the past and have largely been manual operations seen to be clumsy in comparison with techniques used in other fields. For example, in the production of Licence Plates, the registration number is firstly printed on a board and then rolled in combination with a plastics rigid sheet through two metal rollers compressing and adhering the layers together. With this technique it is also required to pass a blanket type material between the rollers simultaneously to ensure the two laminated layers adhere evenly. In this invention it is realised that mis-alignment of the two layers may easily result, there being little control of the two layers once the rolling action has commenced.Additionally, in the production of signs, the mounting of certificates and so on it has been common to simply apply a transparent adhesive to one side of a plastics sheet and subsequently attempt to adhere the printed sign or certificate to the plastics sheet without bubbling or buckling of the printed matter. Again,

CLAIMS
1. A method for laminating a sheet of printed matter to a plastics sheet comprising removing a small portion of an adhesive protecting cover sheet from the plastics sheet, adhering a portion of the sheet of printed matter to the exposed plastics sheet, removing the remainder of the cover sheet from the plastics sheet and then rolling the plastics sheet together with the sheet of printed matter through rollers so as to cause adherence of the two sheets.
2. Apparatus for enabling adherence of a plastics sheet with a sheet of printed matter, comprising two rollers being spaced apart by the thickness of the laminated combination of the plastic sheet and printed matter, means of rotating at least one of said rollers, feeding means for feeding said plastic sheet and said sheet of printed matter in combination through the rollers, wherein said feeding means ensures the respective sheets are combined in correct alignment and not allowed to come in contact with each other until such time as they are correctly aligned and rolled.
3. Apparatus as claimed in Claim 2, wherein said feeding means includes a guard for separating the sheet of printed matter from the plastic sheet prior to combining them between said rollers.
4. Apparatus as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim 3, wherein said plastics sheet is rigid.
5. A tool for use in tearing a strip from an end of a 


 sheet of paper or plastics, wherein said tool is T-shaped having a leg member connected and perpendicularly disposed to a head member, said leg member having two parallel cutting edges to enable the tool to be used conveniently by both right and left handed operators.
6. A tool as claimed in Claim 5, wherein the leg member is at least 220 mm long.
7. A tool as claimed in Claim 5 or Claim 6, wherein the head member includes cut out portions at the respective corners made between the ends of the head member and the edge of the head member closest to the leg member and the head member extends longitudinally from each said edge of the leg member by a distance equal to a predetermined optimum width of the strip to be removed.
8. A tool as claimed in Claim 5 or Claim 6, wherein the head member includes cut out portions located at the edge of the head member closest to the leg member and at a distance from the respective edge of the leg member equivalent to the predetermined optimum width of the strip to be removed.
9. A tool as claimed in Claim 7 or Claim 8, wherein said cut out portion has a profile adapted to provide a pointer means which, when pointed at the closest top corner of said sheet, causes the upper cutting edge to be at the predetermined location of the tear.
10. A tool as claimed in any one of Claims 5 to 9, wherein said leg member comprises a recessed 



 trough adapted to provide a finger gripping means for the operator when using the alignment tool.
11. A method of producing licence plates for displaying variable information, said method comprising a database for receiving and compiling input information relating to a licence to be issued, determining required data output for said licence and producing a sheet of printed matter in accordance with said data and laminating said sheet of printed matter to a rigid plastics sheet by removing a small portion of an adhesive protecting cover sheet from the plastics sheet, adhering a portion of the printed matter to the exposed plastics sheet, removing the remainder of the cover sheet from the plastics sheet and then rolling the plastics sheet together with the printed matter through rollers so as to cause adherence of the two sheets.
