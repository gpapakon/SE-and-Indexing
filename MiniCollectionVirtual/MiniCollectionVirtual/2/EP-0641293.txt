<ABSTRACT>
A suspension which is preferably an ink-containing waste suspension recovered from a paper deinking process is flocculated by a cationic polymeric flocculant, and the flocculated material is then aggregated by an anionic colloidal material mixed into the flocculated suspension, optionally further cationic flocculant is added, and the aggregated material is then separated from the suspension by belt press or other pressure filtration.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for separating
suspended solids from an aqueous suspension and which
includes a dewatering stage that is conducted by pressure
filtration.The invention is of particular applicability to
processes in which the suspension contains hydrophobic
material such as ink particles, and especially when the
suspension is a suspension of waste material in a paper
deinking process.It is well known to add a flocculant material to
a suspension so as to cause the suspended material to
flocculate before dewatering. Suitable flocculants for
this purpose include alum and other polyvalent metal salts,
bentonite, and various natural or synthetic polymers that
can be non-ionic, anionic or cationic. In some instances
combinations are known, for instance bentonite followed by
a polymer. Some of the flocculant materials might be
considered, more accurately, to be coagulants rather than
flocculants.The choice of flocculant is dictated by the particular
process steps that are involved, the materials that are
being flocculated, and the ecoomics of the process. For
instance a process that is designed to make a product that
can be sold may justify a more expensive flocculant than a
process designed to make a waste product. Similarly, a
process designed to flocculate essentially hydrophilic
materials will generally require different flocculants from
a process designed to flocculate essentially hydrophobic
materials.A flocculation process useful in the production of
paper is commercialised under the trade name "Hydrocol" and
is described in EP-A-235893. In this a substantially
linear synthetic cationic polymer having molecular weight
above 500,000 is added to a cellulosic suspension to form
flocs which are then broken down by shearing to form 
microflocs, and bentonite is then added to the sheared
suspension, which is then drained through a screen to form
a paper sheet. This sheet can then be dried over hot
rolls or in an oven. It is essential in this process to
apply sufficient shear to break the initial flocs down to
microflocs as otherwise the paper that is formed by
drainage through the screen will have bad formation and
there will be inefficient drying of the paper in the oven
or over the hot rolls because moisture will be trapped in
the flocs.The process is clearly of no relevance to a process
where the dewatering is by a different technique (pressure
filtration) the suspended solids are entirely different
(generally containing hydrophobic ink) and the intended
product is a cake that will

<CLAIMS>
A process for separating suspended solids from an
aqueous suspension of suspended solids comprising

cellulosic fibre and hydrophobic material by mixing a
cationic polymeric flocculant into the suspension and

thereby flocculating the suspended solids and then
separating the flocculated solids from the suspension by

pressure filtration to form a cake, characterised in that
the flocculated solids are aggregated by mixing an anionic

colloidal material selected from inorganic polymers and swelling clays into the flocculated suspension and the
suspension containing the aggregated solids is subjected to

the pressure filtration.
A process according to claim 1 in which the suspension
comprises mill effluent solids.
A process according to claim 2 in which the suspension
is a suspension containing 5 to 50% by weight insoluble ink

particles, 10 to 70% by weight cellulosic fibres and fines,
and 0 to 80% by weight filler, the percentages being based

on total solids.
A process according to claim 2 or claim 3 in which the
suspension comprises the Reject suspension obtained in a

paper deinking process by subjecting a suspension of paper
fibres, filler and ink particles to flotation and thereby

separating a hydrophobic Reject suspension from a
hydrophilic Accept fraction.
A process according to any preceding claim that is
part of a paper deinking process, and in which the cake is

dumped.
A process according to any preceding claim in which
the pressure filtration is by a belt press.
A process according to any preceding claim in which
the flocculated solids are broken down to microflocs by

stirring before adding the anionic colloidal material.
A process according to any preceding claim in which
the anionic colloidal material is an anionic swelling clay. 
A process according to any preceding claim in which
the suspension has a suspended solids content of at least

0.1% by weight.
A process according to any preceding claim in which
the polymer has intrinsic viscosity at least 4 dl/g.
A process according to claim 10 in which the polymer
is a copolymer of acrylamide with dialkylaminoalkyl (meth)

acrylate or dialkylaminoalkyl (meth) acrylamide as acid
salt or quaternary ammonium salt.
A process according to any of claims 1 to 9 in which
the cationic polymer is a water soluble organic synthetic

polymer selected from polymers of cationic ethylenically
unsaturated monomer, polyethylene imine, dicyandiamide

polymers, and polyamine epichlorhydrin polymers wherein the
polymer has IV 0.2 to 3dl/g and is formed from monomer of

which at least 50% by weight is cationic.
A process according to any preceding claim in which
the suspension containing the aggregated solids is

flocculated by adding a second cationic polymeric
flocculant before the pressure filtration, wherein this

second flocculant has IV at least 4dl/g.
