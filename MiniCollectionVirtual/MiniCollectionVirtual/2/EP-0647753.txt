<ABSTRACT>
A remote keyless entry vehicle receiver includes a 
memory (100,102) that stores a security code (A,B) 

for uniquely identifying 
a transmitter that is authorized entry into the vehicle. 

The memory (104) also stores a broadcast code (BC) that identifies a 
bro
adcast message intended for general use by a group of 
vehicles, each being equipped with a similar receiver. A 

signal is received which includes at least a coded portion. 
The received coded portion is compared with each of the 

codes that are stored in memory. Vehicle entry is 
permitted when the received signal includes a coded portion 

that matches the stored security code (A,B). The driver is 
alerted and/or provided with a message when the received 

signal includes a coded portion that matches the stored 
broadcast code (BC).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the art of remote
keyless entry systems and, more particularly, to a receiver
for use in such systems as well as for use in receiving a
public broadcast which may include information for advising
a vehicle operator of traffic and/or roadway conditions and
the like.Radio broadcast systems are known for providing
traffic and roadway advisory messages to vehicle operators.
Such systems are used by entertainment complexes and the
like and frequently include roadside transmitters which
repeatedly transmit recorded traffic messages to arriving
vehicles. These broadcast messages are typically broadcast
over an RF frequency and a visitor merely tunes a standard
radio receiver to the frequency containing the recorded
message. It is also known to provide emergency vehicles,
such as ambulances and the like, with special transmitting 
equipment to broadcast messages to other nearby vehicles
providing information that the emergency vehicle is
approaching.Keyless entry systems for motor vehicles are also
known in the art and typically control the locking-unlocking
functions of a motor vehicle door lock. Such
systems include a receiver mounted on a vehicle and one or
more portable handheld transmitters located remote from the
receiver. The receiver has a memory which stores one or
more identification or security codes, each of which
identifies a particular transmitter. Each transmitter may
be provided with a plurality of manually actuatable
switches, each representative of a control function to be
performed, such as unlock or lock the vehicle door. The
transmitter includes circuitry that responds to the
actuation of one of the switches to transmit a digital
signal which includes an identification or security code
that uniquely identifies the transmitter from that of a
plurality of similar transmitters, along with a function
code representative of a particular function to be
performed, such as unlock a door. When a receiver receives
such a digital signal, it compares the received security
code with each of a plurality of stored security codes to
determine if a match exists indicative that the receiver
may validly receive the digital signal and respond thereto.
If a match takes place, the receiver responds to the
function code by causing performance of the control 
function requested, such as unlock the vehicle door. A
system as described above is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
4,881,148.Other keyless entry systems include the U.S. Patent to
Tomoda et al. 4,763,121 and the U.S. Patent to
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A vehicle receiver for use in a remote keyless
entry system in a vehicle comprising:


means (50; 56) for storing a security code uniquely
identifying a transmitter (TA) that is authorized entry into

said vehicle and for storing a broadcast code identifying a
broadcast message intended for general use by at least a

group of vehicles that are each equipped with a said
receiver;
means (C) for receiving a signal(s) having at least a
coded portion;
means for comparing said coded portion of a said
received signal with each of said stored codes; and
means for controlling access to said vehicle when
said received signal includes a coded portion that matches

said stored security code and for controlling the provision
of a driver message when said received signal includes a

coded portion that matches said stored broadcast code.
A vehicle receiver as set forth in claim 1
including information display means (200) for displaying visual

information to a vehicle operator when said coded portion
matches said stored broadcast code. 
A vehicle receiver as set forth in claim 1
including audible means (202) for providing an audible indication

when said received signal includes a coded portion that
matches said stored broadcast code.
A vehicle receiver as set forth in claim 3
including manually operable override means (204) for deactivating

said audible means.
A vehicle receiver as set forth in claim 3
including information display means for providing a video

display along with said audible indication when said
received signal includes a coded portion that matches said

stored broadcast code.
A vehicle receiver as set forth in claim 1
wherein said receiving means includes means for receiving a

said signal having a coded portion (62) as well as a second
portion wherein said second portion includes multiple

character message information following said coded portion
when said coded portion matches said stored broadcast code,

said receiving means including means (108) for storing said
multiple character message information following said coded

portion.
A vehicle receiver as set forth in claim 6
including a message display (200) for displaying a multiple 

character message in accordance with said received multiple
character message information.
A vehicle receiver as set forth in claim 7
including audible means for providing an audible indication

to a vehicle operator when said received signal includes a
coded portion that matches said stored broadcast code.
A vehicle receiver as set forth in claim 8
including manual override means for deactivating said

audible means.
A vehicle receiver as set forth in claim 7
including vehicle speaker mute control means to initiate

deactivation of a vehicle radio speaker when said received
signal includes a coded portion that matches said stored

broadcast code.
