<ABSTRACT>
Soft error immunity of a storage cell is greatly 
increased by division of a storage node into at least two 

portions and location of those portions on opposite sides 
of an isolation structure, such as a well of a conductivity 

type opposite to that of the substrate in which transistors 
of the memory cell may also be formed. The isolation 

structure thus limits collection of charge to only one of 
the portions of the storage node and reduces charge 

collection efficiency to a level where a critical amount of 
charge cannot be collected in all but a statistically 

negligible number of cases when such charge is engendered 
by impingement by ionizing radiation, such as energetic 

alpha particles. The layout of the memory cell having this 
feature also advantageously provides a simplified topology 

for the formation of additional ports comprising word line 
access transistors and bit lines.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the 
structure of cells of static memory devices and, more 
particularly, to a structure for cells of static memory 
devices which is substantially immune to so-called soft 
errors, generally caused by discharging of stored charge 
due to impact of energetic particles present in the 
environment. Storage of data and instructions in a memory structure 
is necessary to virtually any data processor application. 
For this reason, among others, the development of high-performance 
memory
 
structures has accompanied the development of data 
processing circuits and integrated microprocessors in 
particular. Thus, as integration density and processing 
power of microprocessors has increased, the same attributes 
have been sought in memory structures to obtain greater 
numbers of bits of storage per chip as well as to increase 
speed of the memory structure. Memory structures are often considered to fall into 
one of two groups: dynamic memories and static memories. 
Dynamic memories offer the greatest potential for reduction 
of cell size and hence the potential for the greatest 
amount of storage per chip. Power consumption is also 
relatively low. On the other hand, the storage mechanism 
is almost entirely capacitive and, since some degree of 
leakage is unavoidable in any storage structure, the stored 
charge representing the stored data must be refreshed 
periodically. This requirement for periodic refreshing of 
stored data causes some periods during which the dynamic  
 
memory is not available to be read and thus increases the 
average cycle time and effectively reduces the speed of the 
response of the memory. Further, the mechanism for reading 
a dynamic memory essentially requires the use of the stored 
charge to cause a charge imbalance in a sense amplifier 
which establishes an appropriate logic voltage output for 
the memory. However, this operation also requires that the 
stored charge be rewritten to the cell, further increasing 
minimum read access time. Highest memory read access speed is achieved by static 
random access memories (SRAMs). In such static memories, 
the data is stored in a bistable latch comprised of active 
circuits. Therefore no time is required for either refresh 
or other operations to restore charge after reading. While SRAMs are not generally regarded as relying on 
stored charge (since, in normal operation, any charge lost 
through reading or leakage is continually replaced by 
operation of the active bistable circuit therein),
