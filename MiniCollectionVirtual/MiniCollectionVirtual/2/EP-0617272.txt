<ABSTRACT>
The device according to the invention employs means for encapsulating the filter element, which act in the manner of a sphincter, means making it possible to generate an air flow through the filter element once the filter element has been encapsulated, and means which make it possible to measure at least one parameter relating to the fluid flux which passes through the filter element. The encapsulation means comprise a succession of encapsulation modules (2 to 5) arranged coaxially end to end and each acting in the manner of a sphincter and independently of the others by virtue of control means which are separate from the control means of the other encapsulation means. The invention applies in particular to measuring the drawing properties of filter plugs used in filter-tipped cigarettes.

A device for measuring the porosity of a
filter element, said device using a filter element

encapsulating means acting like a sphincter, a means
enabling an air flow to be generated through said

filter element once said filter element has been
encapsulated, and a means enabling measurement of at

least one parameter relating to the fluid flow through
said filter element,

characterized in that said encapsulating means

comprises a succession of encapsulation modules (2 to
5) arranged coaxially end to end and each acting like a

sphincter, independently of the others, by means of a
control means separate from that of the others.
The device as claimed in claim 1,

characterized in that the number of encapsulation
modules (2 to 5) depends on the length of said filter

element, so as to encapsulate filters of different
lengths.
The device as claimed in one of claims 1 and
2,

characterized in that said encapsulation modules (2 to
5) use a tubular body (1) whose inner cylindrical wall

is lined with an elastic tubular membrane which, along
with said wall, delimits an intermediate volume (11 to

14) in which the pressure can be modified by a control
circuit so that said membrane can be in the following

two states:

a retracted state, retracted towards said wall and
providing a cross section of maximum passage,
an outspread state, spread out towards the center of
said body (1), in which it has a cross section of

reduced passage, so as to be able to apply itself
against and partially encapsulate a filter element 

disposed inside said body (1) while it was in the
retracted state.
The device as claimed in claim 3,

characterized in that the switching from one of said
states to the other is achieved by admitting, into said

intermediate volume (11 to 14), a pressurized fluid or,
on the contrary, by creating a partial vacuum inside

said volume.
The device as claimed in one of the preceding
claims,

characterized in that said tubular body (1) is common
to all said encapsulation modules (2 to 5).
The device as claimed in claim 5,

characterized in that said elastic tubular membranes of
said different encapsulation modules (2 to 5) are

disposed end to end and connected to one another, in a
tight manner, by means of a multiplicity of annular

distance tubes (6 to 10) in airtight contact with said
body, so as to constitute a succession of intermediate

volumes (11 to 14) each delimited by said inner wall of
said body (1), a membrane portion and two successive

annular distance tubes, each of these volumes (11 to
14) being connected to a control circuit (16 to 19)

separate from that of the others.
The device as claimed in claim 6,

characterized in that said intermediate volumes
communicate with a distributor (15) mounted on said

body, via respective radial bores (16 to 19).
The device as claimed in claim 7,

characterized in that said distributor consists in a
slide valve formed by a cylindrical tubular sleeve

element (20) mounted slidably on said body (1) by means
of three tightness seals (21, 22, 23) axially offset so

as to delimit two annular chambers (24, 25) of which
one is connected to a permanent suction circuit, with 

the other being connected to a control circuit capable
of generating a suction or an airing, or even an

injection of pressurized fluid.
The device as claimed in one of the preceding
claims,

characterized in that said encapsulation means further
comprises successively, above a basic encapsulation

module (5) :

an elastic membrane portion (36) forming an
additional sphincter acting as a retaining stop for

the filter stick when the latter is inserted,
a sealing shutter (37) susceptible of changing from
an open position to a closed position in which it

tightly seals the body (1), by delimiting a suction
chamber inside the latter.
The device as claimed in claim 9,

characterized in that said suction chamber is connected
to a measuring circuit (40) which comprises a suction

circuit (41) fitted with a pressure sensor (42) and
connected to a mechanism (43) for generating a static

vacuum via a critical flow rate orifice (44).
The device as claimed in claim 10, .

characterized in that the vacuum generator (43) is of
the venturi type and is fed with an air flow commanded

by an electrovalve.
The device as claimed in one of claims 9 and
10,

characterized in that the values detected by said
sensor (42) are acquired by a microcomputer which

performs the device control tasks and data management.
