<ABSTRACT>
A needle protection safety package (2), instead of being enclosed in a pouch or other containment wrappings, has fitted thereto at respective ends thereof caps (28) or sheaths (40) so that both the needle (14) and the end (10) to which a syringe is adapted to mate remain enclosed and sterile. Such an arrangement enables easy transport of the safety needle package and provides convenience for the user at the same time. The safety package (2) is further designed to prevent burring of the tip of the needle as the cap or sheath is removed from the needle portion of the package. A further embodiment of the safety package incorporates a locking mechanism (60, 62) which prevents contact between the needle and the housing as the housing is pivoted to envelop the needle after use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to needle protection devices and
more particularly to a convenient to use safety needle package.In a medical emergency, time is of the essence. For example,
medical personnel have to quickly assemble a syringe to a needle for
injecting medicant to a patient. With the recent onslaught of contagious
diseases, to safeguard medical personnel, and bystanders, needle
protection devices have been added to prevent unwanted needle sticks.US-A-4 982 842 shows such a protection device.
Such incorporation of needle protection devices to the needle and
syringe requires additional time.A particular needle protection device having a needle integrated
to a base, which in turn has connected thereto a pivotable housing, is
disclosed in Landis U.S. patent 4,664,259. To maintain sterility for the
device, in one of the embodiments, a frangible strip is provided to seal
the housing to the base so that, in order to use the device, the frangible
strip has to be peeled away and the housing pivoted away from the
needle. This embodiment does not provide a sterile luer to which the
syringe is mated. A second embodiment of the Landis invention shows
the wrapping of the needle protection device in a sealed plastic pouch.
Thus, a user has to tear the pouch to get to the device. As is well
known, such pouches are oftentimes difficult to tear, particularly when
they have been designed to be sufficiently strong to prevent accidental
tearing. Accordingly, precious seconds may be wasted in removing the
Landis device from its containment pouch. So, too, such pouch 
packages are bulky and medical personnel do not like to carry more than
the minimum with them.At the present time, another needle protection device sold in a
pouch is the NEEDLE-PROâ„¢ manufactured by the assignee of the
present invention. From experience, it has been found that, in certain
circumstances, the encasement of such needle protection device in a
pouch, or other types of containment wrapping, is inconvenient.To provide both convenience and sterility, the present invention
safety package (cartridge) has a base having a first end adapted to mate
with a syringe and a second end adapted to mate with a needle. The
sterile end to be mated to the syringe is enclosed by a cap, which is non-permanently
fixed, as for example by stick-welding or a frangible
adhesive tape, to the base such that it becomes part of the package but
nonetheless can be easily twisted off. Likewise, the end adapted to mate
with a needle, if no needle has already been mated
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A safety package (2) comprising a base (4) having a first end (16) adapted to mate
with a syringe and a second end (10) adapted to mate with a needle assembly (12, 14),

the base having a housing (6) hingedly attached with the base and pivotal to a position
substantially aligned along the longitudinal axis of the base, 
characterised in that
 the
package has a cap (28) enclosing the first end (16) of the base (4), a sheath (40)

enclosing the second end (10) of the base, and that the housing (6) is attached with the
base (4) and is pivotal for substantially enveloping the needle after the cap (28) and

sheath (40) have been removed from the base.
A safety package according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the second end (10) of
the base (4) has an internal screw thread into which is threaded the hub (12) of the

needle (14), and that the sheath (40) cooperates with the base (4) so that when the hub
(12) is threaded into the base (4), the sheath is loosened from the hub for easy

removal from the needle.
A safety package according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that

the housing (6) is arranged to cooperate with the base (4) when pivoted into
substantial alignment with the base so as to retain the housing in substantial

alignment.
A safety package according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the base (4) and housing
(6) have interengaging surface formations (60, 62, 64, 66, 70b, 72) that retain the

housing (6) in substantial alignment when pivoted in substantial alignment.
A safety package according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the surface formations
are provided by an opening (60) in the housing (6) and a projection (62, 64, 66) on the

base (4). 
A safety package according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the projection has an
enlarged portion (64) at one end that can be inserted through the opening (60) but

prevents withdrawal from the opening.
A safety package according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the interengaging surface
formations are provided by a finger (72) on the housing (6) and a flange (70) on the

base (4).
A safety package according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that

the cap (28) and sheath (40) are fixed to the base (4) in a manner that requires a torque
force to remove.
