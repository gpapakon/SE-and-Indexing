<ABSTRACT>
A tractor having a front axle (15) that pivotally moves 
laterally in response to a corresponding steering action of the 

steerable wheels (17) mounted on the front axle (15) is 
disclosed wherein an implement attachment mechanism (40) is 

detachably connected directly to the front axle (15) in a 
manner so as to be laterally movable relative to the chassis 

(11) with the shiftable front axle (15). The implement 
attachment mechanism (40) includes a hydraulically powered lift 

mechanism (49) to power a vertical movement of any implement 
(50) attached thereto relative to the chassis (11). An optional 

supplemental support strap (44) detachably connects to the 
frame portion (45) of the implement attachment mechanism (40) 

and engages the pivot assembly (13, 30) supporting the front 
axle (15) from the chassis (11) to provide additional support 

for connecting said implement attachment mechanism (40) to said 
front axle (15) without interfering with the pivotal movement 

of the front axle (15) relative to the chassis (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a steering 
mechanism for an agricultural tractor in which the front axle 
is laterally shiftable in response to a steering movement of 
the steerable wheels and, more particularly, to an implement 
attachment mechanism which is mounted directly to the shiftable 
front axle to enhance steering operation associated with front 
mounted implements. Tractors, whether used in an agricultural setting or in an 
industrial setting, typically include a fixed axle through 
which primary driving power is transferred through fixed wheels 
rotatably mounted on opposing ends of the fixed axle, and a 
steering axle having pivotally mounted steerable ground 
engaging wheels rotatably mounted on the opposing ends thereof 
to support the chassis of the tractor above the ground. 
Supplemental driving power is often provided to the steerable 
ground engaging wheels, while a steering mechanism remotely 
controllable by the operator from the operator's compartment 
selectively controls the pivotal movement of the steerable 
wheels relative to the steering axle. One such steering mechanism incorporates a transversely 
disposed, horizontally extending hydraulic cylinder supported 
by the steering axle and connected to the opposing steerable 
wheels. This hydraulic cylinder affects pivotal movement of the 
steerable wheels about their respective pivotal connections to 
the steering axle by manipulating the pressures in the 
hydraulic cylinder to effect a transverse extension of the 
cylinder rod, causing a turning of the wheels. Due to physical limitations relating to the range of 
movement of the steering mechanism and to the eventual 
interference between the steerable wheels and the steering 
axle, the amount of pivotal movement of the steerable wheels  
 
relative to the steering axle is limited to a given turning 
angle. This maximum turning angle defines the minimum turning 
radius of the tractor for a given wheel base length and tread 
spacing. The selection of the length of the wheel base, i.e., 
the distance between the fixed axle and the steering axle, is a 
compromise between the need to minimize the turning radius and, 
therefore, minimize the wheel base length, and to maximize ride 
considerations which require longer wheel base lengths. These conflicting wheel base requirements can be better 
resolved by a steering mechanism incorporating a laterally 
shifting front axle that is movable in response to a 
corresponding steering movement of the steerable wheels 
such as

A tractor having : 

a chassis (11); 
a transverse front axle (15) connected by a 
pivot assembly (13, 30) to a forward portion of said chassis 

(11) and having pivotally mounted thereon a pair of 
laterally spaced steerable wheels (17), 

said chassis (11) comprising a front portion overlying said 
front axle (15), 

said front axle (15) 
being pivotally connected to said chassis (11) for pivotal 

lateral movement relative thereto; 
steering means (19) operably connected to said 
steerable wheels (17) 

and to said front axle (15) 
to control the pivotal movement of 

said steerable wheels (17) relative to said front axle (15); 
and 
control means (28) operably interconnecting said 
steerable wheels (17) and said chassis (11) to effect said 

pivotal lateral movement of said front axle (15) relative to said 
chassis (11) in response to a corresponding pivotal movement 

of said steerable wheels (17); and
 
   characterized in that an implement attachment 

mechanism (40) is mounted to said front axle (15) for 
lateral movement in unison therewith relative to said 

chassis (11); said implement attachment mechanism (40) being 
adapted to attach a ground engaging implement forwardly of 

said tractor to be pushed by said tractor when moving in a 
forward direction and comprising a mounting bracket (42) 

which is detachably affixed to the front axle (15) by means 
of fasteners (43). 
A tractor according to claim 1 characterized in 
that the implement attachment mechanism (40) further 

comprises a frame portion (45), a lower link assembly (47)  
 

and an upper link (48) both pivotally connected to said 
frame portion (45), and a lift mechanism (49) for effecting 

pivotal movement of said lower link assembly (47) relative 
to said frame portion (45).  

 
A tractor according to claim 2 characterized in 
that said lift mechanism (49) includes a pair of hydraulic 

cylinders (49) interconnecting said frame portion (45) and 
said lower link assembly (47) to power the pivotal 

movement therebetween.

detachably affixed to said mounting bracket (42) by means 
of fasteners (46).

(46a) through which said fasteners (46) are passed in a 
manner such that a relative vertical movement and/or a 

slight canting between the frame portion (45) and the 
mounting bracket (42) is allowed to accommodate a
 vertical 
positioning of an implement (50) relative to the front 

axle (15), respectively to allow a non-parallel alignment 
of the implement (50) with respect to the front axle (15) 

as seen in the direction of operative travel of the 
tractor. 
A tractor according to any of the preceding
