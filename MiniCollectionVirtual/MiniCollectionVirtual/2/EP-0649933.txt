A washing machine is described, particularly a laundry washing machine of the domestic 
type, comprising a system for controlling the detergent consumption. 
The main feature of the described laundry washing machine is that it comprises means for 
detecting the detergent concentration in the washing liquid, means for estimating its optimal 

concentration and means for signalling the user with the result of the comparison between the 
detected detergent concentration and the optimal one, in order to educate him, wash after 

wash, in a more correct use of the detergent, so as to avoid useless waste and to reduce as far 
as possible the negative effects on the environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a washing machine, in particular a laundry washing machine
of the domestic type.It is known that, in general, the user of a laundry washing machine tends to introduce in the
machine more detergent than is strictly necessary, thus causing a useless waste and a negative
effect on the environment.Laundry washing machines are known, having means for the automatic detergent dosage and
also the problems being associated to such a function are known, which refer both to powder
and liquid detergents.In the case of powder detergents, the main difficulties are the following:
several types of powder detergents exist, whose characteristics depend upon their volume
(normal detergents and concentrated detergents), that make a volumetric-type dosage (that is
actually the most diffused) very critical;great problems exist due to the progressive stratification of the powder detergents
components, which are mainly characterised by different specific weights, because of
vibrations generated by the washing machine, said vibrations being notable in the laundry
washing machine above all during the spinning phases;finally, obvious humidity problems exist (always present in a washing machine) which, even
if minimised by the use of suitable containers, cause however a progressive degeneration over
time of the detergent's characteristics, due to the effect of oxidation processes.In the case of liquid detergents for laundry washing machines, the main problems are the
following:
an automatic liquid detergent dosage, even if simpler to realise (at least apparently so), 
would not result however in being adequate, due to the fact that such a type of detergent presents more
limited characteristics if compared to the powder ones; the liquid detergents cannot, in fact, contain the so-called
bleaching agents (generally constituted by perborates and oxidants), inasmuch they are not stable in the
liquid state;the realisation of the liquid detergent dispenser imposes the use of a container being rigorously hermetic
and equipped with a suitable valve for the elimination of air, due to the fact that such type of detergent has the
drawback, if contained in a non hermetic environment, of vaporising and progressively and remarkably
increasing its viscosity, thus causing irreversible damage to the distribution apparatus of the dispenser.
US 3,794,925 and US 3,645,669 describe typical systems for the automatic addition of the washing
agents in a washing liquid, as soon as the detergent concentration falls below a
