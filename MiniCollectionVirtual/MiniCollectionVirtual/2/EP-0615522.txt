<ABSTRACT>
Muramyl peptide compounds which: (a) are non-pyrogenic; and/or (b) ameliorate endotoxin-induced weight loss and/or hypophagia; and/or (c) reduce TNF production; and/or (d) stimulate macrophages to process endotoxin are useful, in the treatment of septic shock, cachexia and other life-threatening inflammatory conditions. Preferred compounds include N-acetyl-glucosaminyl-N-acetyl-muramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (GMDP) and N-acetyl-glucosaminyl-N-acetyl-muramyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamic acid (GMDP-A).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the treatment of sepsis,
septic shock and other life-threatening inflammatory
conditions.The mortality of systemic bacterial infection
(bacteraemia) is high, particularly for gram-negative
infections, where mortality levels are still comparable
to those of several decades ago. Hospital-acquired
infections have a higher mortality than community-acquired
infections; post-operative complications due to
bacterial infections represent a real problem in many
hospitals of the world. The mortality of gram-negative
bacteraemia is frequently due to septic shock.Septic shock (also known as toxic shock) is an acute
life-threatening inflammatory condition characterised by
hypotension and/or evidence of organ hypoperfusion. The
hypotension results from reduced vascular resistance.
Multiple organ failure and abnormalities of coagulation
frequently develop.Current management of septic shock includes intensive
haemodynamic monitoring with aggressive fluid
replacement if necessary to correct hypovolaemia, and
the administration of inotropes to raise the blood
pressure by increasing the cardiac output. Some of
these drugs, particularly noradrenaline, also cause
vasoconstriction, and so increase peripheral resistance.
Additional supported measures are frequently required,
including haemodialysis, mechanical ventilation and
parenteral nutrition. The underlying infection is
treated with 
anti-infective agents such as antibiotics or other
antibacterials.Other life-threatening inflammatory conditions include
cachexia, which is a chronic condition which may arise
from cancer or chronic infections, for example by viruses
such as the HIV virus. Cachexia is characterised by
abnormal lipid metabolism with hypertriglyceridaemia,
abnormal protein and glucose metabolism and body wasting.
It may also be implicated in systemic bacterial
infections.The invention also relates to other infections and
inflammatory conditions such as pneumonia, surgical wound
infection, suppuration of the small pelvis, peritonitis,
peritoneal abscess, paracolostomic abscess, cholangitis,
empyema of the gall bladder, phlegmon of front abdomen,
phlegmon of the sigma and postinjective abscess, as well
as to the related complications of endotoxaemia, glucose
depression, hypotension, cardiac arrythmia and
vasodilation.There are today many impressive anti-infective agents
available to the medical practitioner. Antibiotics form
an important sub-group of antibacterials. Antibiotics
are antibacterial agents derived from microorganisms;
