<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-chip module, 
wherein a plurality of unpackaged integrated circuit 
semiconductor chips (IC chips), along with other kinds of 
chips including resistor chips and capacitor chips, are 
mounted on a multi-layer substrate consisting of a base 
substrate of ceramics and all the chip parts of which are 
sealed with a cap for instance some kind of metal cap, and a 
manufacturing method thereof. A multi-chip module (abbreviated as MCM herein) has been 
the subject of much study for its advantages including 
compactness and multi-function ability of the circuit 
structure. FIG. 1 is a sectional view showing a structural 
example of the essential part of a conventional multi-chip 
module, wherein a ceramic multi-layer substrate 1 comprises a 
first signal wiring layer 1a using layers of ceramics in the 
base substrate as dielectric layers and a second signal wiring 
layer 1b using layers of polyimide resin and the like as 
dielectric layers. The surface of the second signal wiring  
 
layer 1b functions as a mount-bonding area for the chip parts 
2 including IC chips, resistor chips and capacitor chips. The ceramic multi-layer substrate 1 is composed of 
stepped convex sections wherein the second signal wiring layer 
1b is built on and integrated with the first signal wiring 
layer 1a. In this structure, on the mount-bonding area, 
thermal via holes 3 are distributed, which penetrates the 
second signal wiring layer 1b to be thermally connected to the 
first signal wiring layer 1a by means of mount-bonding chip 
parts 2. Further, the chip parts 2 mount-bonded to the second 
signal wiring layer 1b are electrically connected to the 
input/output terminal pins 4 of MCM. Namely, the chip parts 2 
are electrically connected to the leading part of the via hole 
located on the first signal wiring layer 1a via both the 
second signal wiring layer 1b and the first signal wiring 
layer 1a. Further, the chip parts 2 are hermetically sealed, 
wherein the open edge of the sealing cap 6, a metal cap for 
example, is sealed to the seal-ring pattern 5 which is placed 
on the first signal wiring layer 1a surrounding the second 
signal wiring layer 1b. In this type of MCM, because the chip 
parts 2 mount-bonded to the second signal wiring layer 1b 
radiate heat in movement, a heat sink metal fin 7 is commonly 
installed on the rear side of the ceramic multi-layer 
substrate 1 (namely, of the first signal wiring layer 1a). A typical manufacturing process of MCM with the structure 
is
