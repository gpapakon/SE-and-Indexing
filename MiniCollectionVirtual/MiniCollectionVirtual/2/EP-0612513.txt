<ABSTRACT>
An external skin treatment composition comprising 
erythritol, hydrogenated lecithin, and a polyoxyethylene-added 

cholesterol derivative, which is superior in 
prevention and improvement of skin roughness, with little 

sticky feeling, with quick absorption into the skin, and 
superior in the softening effect on the corneum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an external 
skin treatment composition which improves skin roughness, 
is quickly absorbed into the skin, softens the stratum 
corneum, and is superior in a moisturizing effect. One of the main purposes of external skin 
treatment compositions such as cosmetics is the 
prevention and improvement of skin roughness. To achieve 
this purpose, in the past the practice has been to 
formulate various humectants such as glycerol, sorbitol, 
propylene glycol, polysaccharides. However, there is the problem that humectants 
such as polysaccharides, precipitate in formulations with 
large alcohol contents. Glycerol, sorbitol, propylene 
glycol, chondroitin sulfuric acid, and the like cause 
stickiness and a burning sensation when formulated in too 
much. In the case of amino acids such as DL-threonine 
cause the problems of discoloration or generation of 
foreign odors. External skin treatment compositions containing lecithin are disclosed 
in EP-A-0 349150. Accordingly, the objects of the present invention 
are to eliminate the above-mentioned problems of the 
conventional external skin treatment composition and to 
provide an external skin treatment composition capable of 
improving skin roughness, of being quickly absorbed into 
the skin, of softening the stratum corneum and of being 
superior in moisturizing effect. Other objects and advantages of the present 
invention will be apparent from the following 
description. In accordance with the present invention, there is 
provided an external skin treatment composition 
comprising erythritol, hydrogenated lecithin, and a  
 
polyoxyethylene-added cholesterol derivative. The present invention will be better understood from 
the description set forth below with reference to the 
accompanying Figure 1, which is a graph showing the 
results of measurement of the softening effect on the 
stratum corneum by the external skin treatment 
composition according to the present invention. The present inventors, in consideration of the above 
situation, engaged in repeated in-depth studies and as a 
result found that an external skin treatment composition 
composed of a mixture of erythritol, hydrogenated 
lecithin, and a polyoxyethylene-added cholesterol 
derivative not only is superior in the prevention and 
improvement of skin roughness, but also is small in the 
stickiness observed in the case of in glycerol, sorbitol, 
and other polyhydric alcohols, is quickly absorbed into 
the skin, and is superior in the softening effect of the 
strat
