<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a management system for charging for database queries in a telecommunications network. The query is entered by communication between a remote server centre (SA), and a local subscriber terminal (T), over a switched-type telecommunications link. A management module (MG) for the charging is provided, this module being external to the link and making it possible, by interactive communication between the local subscriber terminal (T) and the management module (MG), as well as between the management module (MG) and the remote server centre (SA), to establish, monitor and bill for the query between the remote server centre (SA) and a subscriber terminal (T). Application to managing queries from server centres on national or international networks.

<CLAIMS>
System for managing the usage of data consultations
in a telecommunication network between a remote server centre

(SA) and a local subscriber terminal (T), communication
between the remote server centre and the local subscriber

terminal being carried out by way of a telecommunication link
(3) of switched type, 
characterized in that
 said system
includes a usage-management means (MG), external to the said

link, making it possible, through a communication of
interactive type between, on the one hand, the said local

subscriber terminal and said management means, and, on the
other hand, between said management means and said remote

server centre, to set up, monitor and acknowledge said usage
between said remote server centre and said subscriber

terminal.
Management system according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 the communication between said
management means and said local subscriber terminal is

carried out by way of a telecommunication link (1) whose data
rate is less than or equal to the data rate of the link (3)

between the local subscriber terminal and the remote server.
Management system according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 the communication between said
management means and said remote server centre is carried out

by way of a packet-switched digital link (2,4).
Management system according to one of the preceding

claims, 
characterized in that
 the said communication of
interactive type between said local subscriber terminal and

said management means respectively said management means and 
said remote server centre is managed by a communication

protocol including at least successively the steps :

of connection of said local subscriber terminal to said
management means and of acknowledgement of said connection,
of transmission by said management means to said remote
server centre of a service request authorization message

(m
2
MGSA) in respect of the relevant subscriber terminal, and,
on validation by said remote server centre, of said service

request authorization message,
of request for connection of said local subscriber
terminal to said remote server centre, by transmission to

the latter of a connection request message (m
3
TSA), and on
validation, of said connection request message,
of transmission and of exchange of data between said
remote server centre and said local subscriber terminal in

accordance with the service provision requested, and
subsequent to the supplying of said requested service

provision,
of transmission by said remote server centre to said
management means of a service provision status message

(m
4
SAMG).
Management system according to Claim 4,

characterized in that
 the said communication protocol can
furthermore include, subsequent to the validation of the

service provision status message by said management means,
steps:


of transmission by said management means to said
subscriber terminal of an information message (m
5
MGT)regarding
the billing of the service provision, consisting of a debit

associated with said subscriber terminal, 
of transmission by said management means to said remote
server centre of a refund message (m
7
MGSA) for the remaining
credit allotted in favour of said subscriber terminal.
Management system according to Claim 4,

characterized in that
 the said connection request message
includes information allowing the subscriber to negotiate the

actual amount of the usage.
Management system according to anyone of Claims 2 to 4,

characterized in that
 the said step of connection of the
said local subscriber terminal to said management means,

said step of transmission by said management means to said
remote server centre of a service request authorization

message, the said step of transmission by said subscriber
terminal to said remote server centre of a connection

request message, the said step of transmission and of
exchange of data between said remote server centre and said

subscriber terminal, the said step of transmission by said
remote server centre to said management means of a service

provision status message, are carried out in real time.
Management system according to anyone of Claims 2
to 5, 
characterized in that
 the step of transmission by said
management means to said local subscriber terminal of a

billing message and the step of transmission by said
management means to said remote server centre of the refund

message are performed in real or non-real time.
Management system according to anyone of the
preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 said management means
comprises at least:


one microcomputer provided with its peripheral elements,
said microcomputer comprising
a plurality of telecommunication cards for microcomputer
allowing the connecting of a plurality of subscriber 

terminals,
a plurality of packet-switching digital link to
microcomputer interface cards enabling access and simultaneous

connection to several separate remote server centres.
Management system according to Claim 9,

characterized in that
 said management means is interconnected
to a remote authorization centre (CA).
Management system according to Claim 9,

characterized in that
 said management means is interconnected
with an electronic payment system.
