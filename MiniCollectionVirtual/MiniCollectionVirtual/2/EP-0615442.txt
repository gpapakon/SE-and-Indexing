<CLAIMS>
Oral depot medicament, characterised by a compressed 
tablet which releases pharmaceutical in an 

approximately constant manner per time unit in aqueous 
medium above 37°C, which essentially consists of a matrix 

of gelatin or fractionated gelatin or mixtures thereof 
and pharmaceutical dispersed therein. 
Oral depot medicament according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the gelatin, fractionated gelatin 

and/or mixture thereof have a maximum in the molecular 
weight distribution which is in the range from 10
4
 to 
10
7
 D. 
Oral depot medicament according to Claim 1 and/or 
2, characterised in that the gelatin has characteristic 

numbers of 50 to 400 bloom. 
Oral depot medicament according to one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterised in that the matrix consists of a 

compressed tablet which in addition to gelatin contains 
synthetic and/or natural polymers and other auxiliaries. 
Oral depot medicament according to one of Claims 
1 to 4, characterised in that, in the medicament, one or 

more pharmaceutical-containing layer(s) alternate with 
one or more pharmaceutical-free layer(s) or layers of 

different pharmaceuticals. 
Oral depot medicament according to one of Claims 
1 to 5, characterised in that it is provided with a 

coating of a synthetic or natural polymer. 
Oral depot medicament according to one of Claims 
1 to 6, characterised in that it is present combined with 

an immediate-effect form. 
Process for the production of an oral depot  
 

medicament according to Claim 1, a powdered gelatin/pharmaceutical 
mixture is prepared using a gelatin and/or 

fractionated gelatin which dissolves slowly in the 
aqueous medium above 37°C and the mixture is compressed. 
Process according to Claim 8, characterised in 
that the gelatin/pharmaceutical substance mixture is 

essentially prepared from gelatin and/or fractionated 
gelatin in addition to synthetic and/or natural polymers 

and other auxiliaries as well as the pharmaceutical. 
Process according to Claims 8 and/or 9, 
characterised in that the mixture is prepared by homogeneously 

mixing powdered gelatin and powdered pharmaceutical. 
Process for the production of an oral depot 
medicament according to Claim 1, characterised in that 

the gelatin/pharmaceutical mixture is compressed directly 
to give a tablet. 
Process according to Claim 8, characterised in 
that the gelatin/pharmaceutical mixture is prepared by 

mixing the gelatin present in sol form with the pharmaceutical 
and then spray-drying. 
Use of a compressed tablet which releases pharmaceutical 
in an approximately constant manner per time 

unit in aqueous medium above 37°C and is made from a 
matrix of gelatin and/or fractionated gelatin and pharmaceutical 

dispersed therein for the production of an oral 
depot pharmaceutical form.
