<ABSTRACT>
Dispersions of finely divided high molecular weight 
polyacrylamide particles are formed and treated with a caustic 

material to hydrolyze the polymer without undesirable side 
chain reactions to form high molecular weight anionic 

acrylamide polymers. A preferred technique for forming these 
products comprises the formation of a stabilized water-in-oil 

emulsion of aqueous acrylamide monomer, polymerizing the 
monomer, reacting the polymer emulsion thus formed with a 

hydrolysis agent and inverting the resultant hydrolyzed 
polymers into solution. These materials are useful in a 

variety of industrial applications for removing particulates 
from effluent streams.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to high molecular weight acrylamide polymers, methods of making and use of same.Aqueous solutions of acrylamide polymers (i.e., "polyacrylamides" or "PAMs") are useful in applications such as
thickening and dewatering of industrial and sewage wastes and the clarification, i.e., by flocculation techniques, of turbid
aqueous solutions. In addition, as discussed for example in U.S. patent No. 4,034,809 to Phillips et al., these materials
have also been found to be useful in secondary and tertiary oil recovery processes wherein the polymer solution
is introduced into subterranean oil-bearing formations to help increase the amount of crude oil recovered.Typically, PAMs are available as powders or as finely divided solids and are dissolved in water to form aqueous
solutions for use in a particular application. It is difficult and time-consuming, however, to dissolve these dry polymers
in water, particularly in the case of hydrolyzed acrylamide polymers. This is because the dry polymer is not readily dispersable
in the liquid and thus has a tendency to form lumps upon contact with the water. Such lumps typically require
an extended period, sometimes as long as 6-10 hours, to dissolve.U.S. patent No. 3,624,019 to Anderson et al. discloses a polymeric latex comprising a water-in-oil emulsion having
dispersed therein finely divided droplets of a water-soluble vinyl addition polymer solution. Polyacrylamide is a preferred
polymer disclosed by the reference. The polymer-containing emulsions described by Anderson et al. are stable. When
inverted in the presence of water, the polymer goes into solution in a very short period of time as compared to the
extended, i.e., 6-8 hour, period required for the dissolution of a dry solid polymer as described above. A water-in-oil
polymerization process and method for making latex polymers is described in U.S. patent No. 3,284,393 to Vanderhoff
et al.A major problem associated with acrylamide polymer lattices of the type described above, however, is that when
they are hydrolyzed, the latex becomes unstable. The polymer present within the latex coagulates and precipitates out
of the water-in-oil emulsion, thus producing a product with little or no commercial value.U.S. patent No. 4,171,296 to Connelly et al. discloses a method for hydrolyzing acrylamide polymers within a polymer
latex, comprising a water-in-oil emulsion containing finely divided polyacrylamide, wherein the latex is stabilized
by the addition of an alkali stable organic surfactant
