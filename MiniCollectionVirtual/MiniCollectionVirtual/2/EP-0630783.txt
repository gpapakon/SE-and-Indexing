<ABSTRACT>
In a gas generating agent pack for an air bag inflation gas 
generator of this invention, a plurality of gas generating agents (57) 

with a through hole (55) formed at the center is accommodated in the 
axial direction in the stacked state within a longitudinal 

cylindrical pack (73) whose both ends are tightly closed, and an 
energizing means (89) for energizing the gas generating agents (57) 

toward 
the end of the cylindrical pack (73) is disposed within the 

cylindrical pack (73), so that the plurality of gas generating agents (57) 

accommodated into the cylindrical pack (73) can be tightly contacted 
securely to one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an air bag inflation gas generator.A prior shock absorber to protect a passenger car driver from shocks at collision accidents
comprises an air bag and a gas generator to inflate the air bag with gas. At a collision
accident of a passenger car, explosives or other gas generating agents having a similar
composition thereto, which are charged in the gas generator, are ignited and burnt to
produce gas. The air bag is instantaneously inflated by the resultant gas for protecting the
driver against any collision shocks, thereby avoiding possible serious injury of the driver.Fig. 7 shows the air bag inflation gas generator disclosed in JP-A-5 138 005.This air bag inflation gas generator comprises a longitudinal outer cylindrical member 13
having a plurality of gas outlets 11 formed in the outer periphery, an inner cylindrical
member 17 inserted in the outer cylindrical member 13 and having gas flow openings 15
formed in the outer periphery, a final filter 19 disposed between the outer cylindrical
member 13 and the inner cylindrical member 17, a plurality of gas generating agents 23 with
a through hole 21 formed at the center accommodated in the stacked state in the axial
direction of the inner cylindrical member 17, and an igniter 25 and an ignition agent 27
disposed at one end of the inner cylindrical member 17, wherein the gas generating agents
23 and the ignition agent 27 are accommodated in a gas generating agent pack 29.With the above air bag inflation gas generator, volume of combustion gas from the gas
generating agents 23 can be steeply increased and a large volume of combustion gas can be
surely purified.But, the gas generating agent pack 29 for the above conventional air bag inflation gas
generator has drawbacks that it is difficult to tightly stack the gas generating agents 23
without any gaps in the gas generating agent pack 29 and the gas generating agents 23 are
mutually bumped by vibration, resulting in damages. More specifically, the aforementioned gas generating agents 23 are generally produced by
dispersing a gas generating component into a binder, charging the resultant binder into a
metal mold and molding under pressure. But, it is very difficult to produce them in a
uniform thickness. Therefore, when many of such gas generating agents 23 are
accommodated in the gas generating agent pack 29, errors in thickness are accumulated
and, for example, when about 20 gas generating agents are stacked, about 3 mm gap is
formed in the gas generating agent pack 29 in to worst
