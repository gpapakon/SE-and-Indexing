<ABSTRACT>
A composition, containing a polymeric blend and internal lubricants, wherein said blend consists essentially of from about 60 to about 100 weight percent of polybenzimidazole and from about 0 to about 40 weight percent of poly(aryletherketone), and said lubricants consist essentially of graphite and boron nitride in a weight ratio of about 1:10 to about 10:1, respectively. The polymer solution is pumped from a reservoir through a filtering system (28) before feeding it through the first inlet of nozzles (22). To aid atomization, a gas such as air or nitrogen is fed into a second inlet of the nozzles (22). An atomization reactor system is utilized to form the highly porous particles of the invention. The reactor system (10) has a cylindrical vessel (12) with upstanding side walls (14) and a coneshaped bottom (16) with an outlet (18) equipped with a particle separation system (20). Many nozzles are contained within the reactor. A recirculation pump (26) maintains suspension of the rounded particles in the non-solvent solution prior to discharging through outlet (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a
polybenzimidazole-containing composition containing
internal lubricants and processes for the preparation of
the composition. The composition is useful for forming low
friction, shaped articles including bearings, bearing
sleeves, rings, etc.Polybenzimidazoles and poly(aryletherketones) are
polymers of high thermal stability and excellent resistance
to oxidative and hydrolytic degradation. Polybenzimidazole
and poly(aryletherketone) blends are known for their
excellent mechanical, thermal and chemical resistance
properties. U.S. Patent No. 4,912,176 to Alvarez et al.
discloses
blends of polybenzimidazole and polyaryleneketones and
sintered articles produced therefrom. Alvarez '176 further
discloses that polybenzimidazole/ poly(aryletherketones)
may be formed into article such as gaskets, seals, valve
seats and O-ring backups.However, these polybenzimidazole/poly(aryletherketone)
articles are not highly durable and wear resistant when 
subjected to friction environments. These articles tend to
overheat and degrade under low friction conditions after short
periods of time.US-A-4 810 730 discloses polymer compositions which may be shaped
into articles and contain conventional internal lubricants such
as graphite.It is desirable to produce a polybenzimidazole-containing composition
that exhibits good mechanical and physical properties as
well as wear resistance in frictional environments.FIG. 1 is a front view in elevation of a heat treating
shell system utilized for shaped articles of the invention.The present invention is directed to a polymeric
composition as defined in the claims containing internal lubricants being suitable for
forming a low friction, shaped article containing from
65 to 85 weight percent of a polymeric blend
and from 15 to 35 weight percent of internal
lubricants, wherein said blend consists essentially of from
60 to 100 weight percent of an aromatic
polybenzimidazole and from 0 to 40 weight
percent of poly(aryletherketone), and said lubricants 
consist essentially of graphite and boron nitride in a
weight ratio of 1:10 to 10:1, respectively.Generally, the aromatic polybenzimidazole useful in
the present composition may be any polybenzimidazole resins
known to those skilled in the art. Typical polymers of
this class and their preparation are more fully described
in U.S. Patent No. 2,895,946: U.S. Patent No. Re. 26,065;
and the Journal of Polymer Science, Vol. 50. pages 511-539
(1961).These polybenzimidazoles consist essentially of
recurring units
