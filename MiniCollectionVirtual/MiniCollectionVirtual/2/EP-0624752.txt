<ABSTRACT>
A protective container (1) with a fluid-tight 
seal for the underground installation of a tank 

(10) containing pressurized liquefied gas. The 
container (1) comprises a cylindrical peripheral 

wall (2) which can surround the tank (10) and form 
a space (17), a base (4) on which the tank (10) 

rests in the vertical position, and a top (6) for 
closing the container when the tank (10) has been 

introduced. 
The top (6) is provided with a hatch (7) 
through which access to the connector (13) for 

charging the tank (10) is provided. 
The hatch (7) is closed by a cover (8) which 
can be travelled over and is fire-resistant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a protective 
container with a fluid-tight seal for the 
underground installation of tanks containing 
pressurized liquefied gas, as for instance is known 
from FR-A-748 880. The invention also relates to underground 
installations obtained by the use of protective 
containers of this type with fluid-tight seals. As is known, tanks containing pressurized 
liquefied gas are usually installed above ground 
close to the places where the gas is to be used, 
which may be factories, restaurants or private 
houses. In the latter case, particularly when it is in 
a garden, the overground installation of the tanks 
is unattractive from the aesthetic point of view 
since it is not always possible to conceal them 
adequately.  
 In order to overcome this disadvantage, it is 
already known to install tanks underground; 
however, in this case, in accordance with current 
technology and in order to satisfy safety 
standards, when the excavations have been carried 
out, a concrete pit has to be provided and made 
impermeable in order to prevent the surrounding 
land being contaminated if the tank is damaged. One example of this technology is illustrated 
in European Patent application EP-A-0 251 917. However, producing cisterns made of concrete 
requires the establishment of a building site, 
however small, the presence of masons and a 
protracted level of inconvenience in addition to 
the necessary inconvenience involved in excavating 
the land. In accordance with further current technology 
illustrated, for example, in the journal "GPL 
ACTUALITE" of December 1992, the underground 
installation of tanks occurs with the latter 
disposed in a horizontal position in a sealed, 
high-density polyethylene shell which can only be 
inspected by remote control using a telecamera.  
 This known technology, whilst enabling the 
production of concrete containment cisterns to be 
avoided as far as possible, nevertheless requires 
the occupation of a large area of the garden or 
locality where the tank is to be installed. Furthermore, this becomes somewhat complex and 
expensive, particularly when it is a matter of 
installations for domestic use. The object of the present invention is to 
overcome the above disadvantages and to allow 
tanks containing pressurized liquefied gas to be 
installed underground such that they occupy as 
small a space as possible, in accordance with the 
dimensions of the tank, which can easily be 
concealed, in such a way that the aesthetic 
aspects of the installation

<CLAIMS>
A protective container (1) with a fluid-tight 
seal for the underground installation of tanks 

(10) containing pressurized liquefied gas, 
comprising a peripheral wall (2) which can 

surround the tank (10), forming a space (17), a 
base (4) for supporting said tank (10), and a top 

(6) provided with a hatch (7), a cover (8) and 
means (29, 40, 41) for releasable connection to 

said peripheral wall (2), characterized in that 
said top wall (6) has a collar (23) aligned with 

the hatch (7), the collar (23) having an axial 
end supported at the front on the pressurized 

liquefied gas tank (10) when the latter is in 
position, sealing means (25, 43) being provided 

between the end of the collar and the tank. 
A protective container according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the base (4) is associated 

with a ballast plate (34). 
A protective container according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that said peripheral wall (2) and 

said top (6) are both provided with respective 
radial lips (38, 37), adjacent and opposite one 

another with the interposition of a seal (39).  
 
A protective container according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that said means 

for connecting the top (6) to said peripheral wall 
(2) consist of tie rods (29). 
A protective container according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that said means 

for connecting the top (6) to the peripheral wall 
(2) consist of an annular strip with a screw 

coupling (with eye-bolts), the annular strip being 
in engagement with the radial lips (37, 38) of the 

edges of the top and the peripheral wall. 
A protective container according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that said hatch 

(7) is provided with a cover (8) shaped with an 
internal cavity (48) containing a fire-resistant 

material (49). 
A protective container according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that the cover (8) extends over 

an axial portion of the collar (23), engaging the 
latter by a thread (46) and a counter-thread (47) 

provided respectively on the outer surface of the
