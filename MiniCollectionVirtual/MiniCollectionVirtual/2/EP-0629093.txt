<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for identifying wireless subscriber units and for granting or 
denying access to a subscriber service includes a plurality of wireless subscriber 

units each for generating a wireless subscriber signal including internal data traits 
and external signal traits. The internal data traits include an identification code. 

The plurality of wireless subscriber units also receive a transmitter/receiver signal. 
A receiver/transmitter is located remote from the wireless subscriber units and 

receives the wireless subscriber signal and transmits the transmitter/receiver signal. 
A characterizing device is connected to the receiver/transmitter and generates a 

plurality of characterizing signals for one of said wireless subscriber units. The 
characterizing device generates said plurality of characterizing signals by measuring 

features of said external traits of said one said wireless subscriber signal from at 
least one of a first category including variations of specified parameters of said one 

of said wireless subscriber units, a second category including variations in non-specified 
parameters, and a third category including variations in reactions or 

responses to interrogations. A converter connected to the characterizing device 
converts the plurality of characterizing signals into a security pattern. The security 

pattern and the identification code are used to identify said one of said wireless 
subscriber units. A historic security pattern storing device stores historic security 

patterns for said wireless subscriber units. A comparing device connected to the 
converter and the historic security pattern storing device compares the security  

 
pattern to the historic security pattern corresponding to said one of said wireless 

subscribers and generates a confidence level indicating a likelihood that one of said 
wireless subscriber units also generated the historic security pattern. An access 

device grants or denies access to the subscriber service based upon the confidence 
level.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to wireless subscriber systems and, more particularly, 
the use of devices for granting or denying access to the wireless subscriber 
system. Some wireless subscriber systems utilize identification codes which are 
transmitted by wireless subscriber units along with other data sent to a 
receiver/transmitter site, base station, or cell. Electronics associated with the 
receiver/transmitter site can identify the wireless subscriber unit by the 
identification code. The identification codes can be used for billing the wireless 
subscriber unit for "air time" on a subscriber system or telephone exchange in 
addition to a basic monthly rate. Such identification codes can be intercepted during an authorized user's 
transmission to the subscriber service or telephone exchange. The identification 
codes can then be programmed into an unauthorized wireless subscriber unit 
allowing the fraudulent user to gain access to the telephone exchange. The use of 
the subscriber service or telephone exchange by the unauthorized user is usually 
incorrectly billed to the authorized user and, of course, the operators of the  
 
subscriber system or telephone exchange are typically unable to collect the basic 
monthly rate from the unauthorized user. Other wireless subscriber units do not automatically transmit an 
identification code during transmission. Identification of these wireless subscriber 
units is desirable when they are interfering with the transmission of other users, 
when they are being operated in a clandestine manner, or when they are otherwise 
being misused. In an effort to address the above problems, radio fingerprinting was 
developed in the 1940's and 1950's. Oscilloscope photos or hand drawings of 
amplitude or frequency-detected turn-on transients, turn-off transients, and a final 
resting frequency of received radio transmitter signals were prepared. The photos 
or drawings reflect the damping factor and natural period of the radio transmitter 
and were visually compared to previous measurements to identify the radio 
transmitter. However radio fingerprinting became more difficult beginning in the 
1960's due to an increasing number of radio transmitters and to manufacturing 
consistency of modern day radio transmitters. Thus, the turn-on transients, turn-off 
transients, and final resting frequency of the radio transmitters became far less 
distinguishable from each other using the radio fingerprinting method. In U.S. Patent No. 5,005,210 to Ferrell, a turn-on transient of a
