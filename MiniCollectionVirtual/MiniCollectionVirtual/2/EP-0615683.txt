<ABSTRACT>
Method for the production of seedlings of plant species, which are especially intended for transplanting, such as, for example, of the Solanaceae (tobacco, tomato, pepper, aubergine, petunia, and the like), by "semifloating", that is to say in which the growth substrates containing the seeds or plantlets are placed on a plate which floats on the nutrient solution contained in a tray, the level of which is maintained constant, characterised in that lauryldimethylbenzylammonium bromide (LDBB) is added to the nutrient solution of the tray at a concentration of greater than 0.01% by weight.

Method for the production of patches of vegetable species, 
in particular intended for pricking out, such as for example 

nicotiana (tobacco, tomato, capsicum, aubergine, petunia etc...) 
by "semi floating", that is to say in which the culture 

substrates containing the seeds or the plantlets are placed on 
a tray which floats on the nutrient solution contained in a 

trough whereof the level is kept constant, characterised by the 
fact that benzylammonium dimethyl lauryl bromide, abbreviated as 

- (BDLB) at a concentration greater than 0.01 % by weight is 
added to the nutrient solution of the trough. 
Method according to Claim 1 in which the concentration of 
BDLB is comprised between 0.04 % and 0.1 % by weight. 
Method according to Claim 2, in which the concentration 
of BDLB is comprised between 0.04 and 0.08 %.
