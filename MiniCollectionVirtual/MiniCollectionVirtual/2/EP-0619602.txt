<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a selective etching 
method, an optoelectronic device and its fabricating 
method suitable for use in, for example, a semiconductor 
laser using a II-VI compound semiconductor. In recent years, demand for semiconductor lasers 
capable of emitting light of short wavelengths has 
increased for improving the recording density of optical 
discs and resolution of laser printers, and vigorous 
studies have been done with the aim of realizing it. The present Applicant, after earnest studies to 
meet such demand, already proposed a semiconductor laser 
using ZnMgSSe compound semiconductors as materials of 
cladding layers and other layers and capable of emitting 
blue to green light (for example, Japanese Patent 
Application No. Hei 4-229356). The above-mentioned semiconductor laser using 
ZnMgSSe compound semiconductors, in general, additionally 
includes one or more materials such as ZnSe compound 
semiconductors other than ZnMgSSe compound semiconductors. 
When fabricating the semiconductor laser, selective 
etching may be needed to process the ZnSe compound 
semiconductor provided on a ZnMgSSe compound semiconductor 
layer into a mesa-type or other type pattern. A method for etching the ZnSe compound  
 
semiconductor layer is a wet etching method using a 
K₂Cr₂O₇ : H₂SO₄ etchant. In the wet etching method, 
however, the etching rate of the ZnMgSSe compound 
semiconductor layer is faster than the etching rate of the 
ZnSe compound semiconductor layer, which results in the 
underlying ZnMgSSe compound semiconductor layer being 
deeply etched during etching of the ZnSe compound 
semiconductor layer thereon. Means heretofore available for preventing this 
problem is a method of estimating etching time required 
for etching the ZnSe compound semiconductor layer on the 
basis of the etching rate of the ZnSe compound 
semiconductor to control the etching depth in view of the 
estimated etching time. This method, however, involves a 
problem from the viewpoint of controllability and 
reproducibility. It is therefore an object of the invention to 
provide a selective etching method excellent in 
controllability and reproducibility of selective etching 
of ZnSe, ZnTe, ZnSSe or Zn1-aMgaSbSe1-b compound 
semiconductor. Another object of the invention is to provide an 
optoelectronic device fabricated by selective etching of 
ZnSe, ZnTe, ZnSSe or Zn1-aMgaSbSe1-b compound 
semiconductor with excellent controllability and  
 
reproducibility and hence improved in manufacturing yield. Still
