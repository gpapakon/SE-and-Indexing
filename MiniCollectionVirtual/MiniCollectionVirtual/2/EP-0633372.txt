<ABSTRACT>
A door lever assembly for disengaging an unlocked latch of 
a lockable door latch assembly includes a lever handle (12) 

rotatably connected to a trim housing (16) and a cam (42) 
operably connected to the lever handle. The cam is 

positioned to rotate in response to rotation of the lever 
handle, converting its rotational movement to linear 

movement of a movable slider (30) positioned adjacent to 
the cam. A lift arm (24) is operably connected to vertical 

rods (62) of the door latch assembly and an over-ride 
spring (20) is connected between the slider and the lift 

arm. The over-ride spring (20) transmits motion of the 
slider to the lift arm to lift the lift arm and the 

connected vertical rods when the door latch assembly is in 
an unlocked position. The over-ride spring compresses in 

response to slider movement when a blocking slide (45) is 
positioned to block movement of the lift arm when the door 

latch assembly is in its locked position, preventing damage 
to components of the door lever assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a door lever handle assembly that
resists vandalism and breakage and more specifically to a
door lever assembly having a breakaway door handle for
operating a door latch.Conventional door levers having a fixed lock position are
subject to damage by vandals or those seeking unauthorised
entry into commercial or public buildings. A locked door
lever extending outward in a substantially horizontal
position can be impacted with hammers or other devices to
break the lever or shatter lock components. In addition,
it is sometimes possible to use the weight of a person
seeking entry to downwardly force a door lever and break
the lock mechanism. To partially overcome this problem,
certain door levers are designed to have shear pins or
other elements for designed failure that break and render
the lever mechanism inoperable after application of undue
force.For example, a conventional door lever typically has a trim
housing configured to accommodate a key cylinder lock above
a rotatable lever handle that is operably connected to a
door latch mechanism. The lever handle is permanently
pinned to a shaft that extends inward to engage an
eccentrically configured cam. The cam can be rotated to
upwardly move a slider plate that is connected to a lift
arm. Movement of the lift arm causes movement of
vertically directed rods that are connected to retract a
door latch. Locking this assembly simply requires rotation
of the key cylinder to engage a blocking slide known as a
trim lock tumbler that prevents movement of the lift arm,
and consequently fixes the slider, cam, shaft, and door
lever in a fixed and locked position. However, with this type of assembly the door lever handle is
fixed (in its locked position) to extend horizontally outward.
To prevent permanent damage to the lock mechanism, a shear pin
is provided to connect the cam and the shaft. Application of
excessive torque forces to the lever handle causes failure of
the shear pin, effectively disconnecting the lever and
attached shaft from the remaining elements of the door lever
assembly. Although this protects the remaining lock elements
from further damage, it does require removal of the trim
housing and replacement of the shear pin to restore lever
function.According to the present invention there is provided a lever
handle assembly for actuating a latch of a lockable door latch
assembly, the door latch assembly having an unlocked and a
locked position, with rods movable, in the unlocked position,
to release said door latch, and
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A lever handle assembly for actuating a latch of a
lockable door latch assembly, the door latch assembly

having an unlocked and a locked position, with rods (62)
movable, in the unlocked position, to release said door latch,

and a blocking slide (45) movable to the locked position to
prevent movement of the vertical rods and the connected

door latch, the lever handle assembly comprising:

a lever handle (12) rotatably connected to a trim
housing (16);
a cam (42) operably connected to the lever handle and
positioned to rotate in response to rotation of the lever

handle;
a slider (30) movable in response to rotation of the
cam;
a lift arm (24) connected to the vertical rods of the
door latch assembly; characterised by
an over-ride spring (20) connected between the slider (30)
and the lift arm (24), with the over-ride spring (20) transmitting

motion of the slider (30) to the lift arm to lift the lift arm
and the connected rods when the door latch assembly is in

its unlocked position, and with the over-ride spring (20)
compressing in response to slider movement without moving

the lift arm when the blocking slide (45) is positioned to
block movement of the lift arm (24) when the door latch

assembly is in its locked position.
A lever handle assembly according to claim 1, further
comprising a shaft (48) attached between the lever handle

and the cam, with a shear pin (49) attaching the shaft to
the cam. 
A lever handle assembly according to claim 2, wherein the
shear pin (49) has at least one flat side (50) to engage a

flat wall defined by the cam.
A lever handle assembly according to claim 2, wherein the
shear pin (49) extends outward from the shaft in only one

direction to engage the cam.
A lever handle assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims, further comprising a stop plate (34) attached to

the trim housing (16), and a compressible lift spring (32)
positioned between the stop plate and the slider for

compression as the slider moves toward the stop plate and
expansion to move the slider away from the stop plate and

return the lever handle (12) to an initial position upon
release of the lever.
A lever handle assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein a or the stop plate (34) is attached to the

trim housing (16), and an elastomer (36) is attached to the
slider to engage the stop plate as the slider moves

adjacent to the stop plate.
A lever handle assembly according to claim 6, wherein the cam
is configured to slip past the slider after engagement of

the elastomer and the stop plate to permit circular
rotation of the lever handle.
A lever handle assembly according to claim 6 or 7, further
comprising a stop (53) attached to the trim housing

adjacent to the cam (42), the stop being positioned to
engage the cam and prevent further rotation of the lever

handle after engagement of the elastomer and the stop
plate. 
A lever handle assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the lever handle in an initial position, in

use, is directed substantially horizontally, and wherein
the cam disengages from moving contact with the slider when

the lever handle is forced past a substantially vertical
position. 
A lever handle assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims and being a double door lever, wherein a or said

stop is attached to the trim housing and positioned to
engage and prevent rotation of the cam through a

predetermined position.
