<ABSTRACT>
A method wherein the wettability with pure water of the surface of a substrate, in particular, a silicon wafer from which the 
oxide film has been removed is improved, whereby pure water is brought into contact with the surface of silicon, so that the impurities 

on the silicon can be completely cleaned away, a system therefor, and a cleaning method. One feature resides in that microwaves 
are applied in a state where water is brought into contact with a catalyst. Furthermore, another feature resides in that a catalyst 

holding means (11), in which the catalyst is held so as to come in contact with the water introduced to the interior thereof, 
and a microwave producing means (12) for applying the microwaves to the water introduced to the catalyst holding means are 

provided in the intermediate portion of a piping for delivering the pure water to a use point (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing 
pure water, a system therefor, and a cleaning method, and in 
particular, relates to a method of producing pure water, a system 
therefor, and a cleaning method which are preferably used in 
cleaning processes in LSI manufacturing processes. The conventional technology will be explained using the 
cleaning process of an LSI process as an example. In an LSI manufacturing process, an oxide film is formed 
on a silicon wafer, window-opening having a predetermined pattern 
is conducted in the oxide film, and then cleaning is conducted, 
and depending on the purpose, p-type or n-type chemical elements 
are introduced, and a procedure, in which the above impurities 
are diffused or annealed in the silicon, is repeatedly conducted 
in a thermal diffusion furnace, and elements are thus formed. When conducting heat treatment such as thermal diffusion 
or annealing or the like, if even a small amount of impurities 
such as, for example, metals or the like, adhere to the silicon 
surface, then the characteristics of the element which is formed 
worsen; for example, a drop in the base collector withstand 
voltage, an increase in leak currents, or the like, is 
experienced.  Accordingly, in semiconductor manufacturing processes, 
cleaning processes are extremely important in order to 
manufacture high-performance elements, and it is necessary to 
completely remove the contaminants on the silicon. However, after the removal of an oxide film, the silicon 
surface is hydrophobic, and the wettability thereof with water is 
normally poor, so that, in other words, it is difficult to bring 
the pure water and the contaminant impurities into contact, and 
it is difficult to completely clean away the very small amount of 
impurities adhering to the silicon surface. As a result, it is 
impossible to obtain elements having higher performance, as 
explained above, and this represents a great hindrance to the 
attainment of a shift to high performance elements. The present invention has as an object thereof to provide 
a method of and system for producing pure water which is capable 
of completely cleaning away impurities on silicon by improving 
the wettability with pure water of a substrate body surface, and 
in particular, a silicon wafer substrate body from which an oxide 
film has been removed, and bringing pure water into contact with 
the silicon surface, and to provide a cleaning method. A first gist of the present invention resides in a pure 
water production
