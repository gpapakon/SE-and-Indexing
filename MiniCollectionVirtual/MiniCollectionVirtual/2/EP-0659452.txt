<ABSTRACT>
A golf clubhead includes a front face, a top crown, and 
a plurality of rails which extend rearwardly from the face and 

downwardly from the crown. The open structure provided by the 
rails permit weight to be distributed high in the toe portion 

and low in the heel portion of the clubhead.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to golf clubheads of the metal 
wood type. More Particularly, the invention relates to a golf 
clubhead which is characterized by an open body structure which 
is provided by a plurality of spaced-apart rails. Most metal wood clubheads have a hollow construction. 
Such clubheads include a hollow body formed by investment 
casting and a soleplate which is welded to the bottom of the 
body. The hollow interior of the clubhead may be filled with 
foamed resin. Almost the entire mass of the clubhead material 
is used to form the shape of the head. As a result, little or 
no mass is available to be distributed in a way which would 
enhance performance. Further, the hollow construction has 
inherent manufacturing problems. For example, in most cases a 
hollow clubhead is formed from two parts which must be joined by 
welding or adhesives. Some metal wood clubheads have been formed integrally, 
and some of those clubheads have included various shaped ribs 
and airfoils. However, such clubheads have generally not 
distributed the weight of the clubhead in a manner which 
optimizes performance.  The invention provides an integrally formed open rail 
metal wood. The clubhead includes a striking face and top crown 
of a traditional head to provide a traditional appearance. 
However, the side skirt and sole are eliminated. They are 
replaced with an open structure which has vertical rails which 
define the outline of the bottom and side of a clubhead. The 
open structure permits weight to be added selectively at 
predetermined locations of the clubhead to enhance performance. 
If desired, weight can also be removed from the top surface of 
the crown by forming grooves therein.  The invention will be explained in conjunction with an 
illustrative embodiment shown in the accompanying drawing, in 
which -- 
Figure 1 is a bottom perspective view of a clubhead 
formed in accordance with the invention; Figure 2 is a top plan view of the clubhead; Figure 3 is a front elevational view of the clubhead; Figure 4 is a toe end view of the clubhead; Figure 5 is a bottom plan view of the clubhead; Figure 6 is a rear elevational view of the clubhead; Figure 7 is a heel end view of the clubhead; Figure 8 is a sectional view taken along the line 8-8 
of Figure 6; Figure 9 is a sectional view taken along the line 9-9 
of Figure 6; Figure 10 is a bottom perspectivew view of another 
embodiment of a clubhead; Figure 11 is a top plan view of the clubhead of Figure 
10; Figure 12 is a toe end view of the clubhead;

<CLAIMS>
A golf club comprising: 
a front face having a toe portion, a heel portion, a bottom portion, and a 

top portion, 
a crown joined to the top portion of the face and extending rearwardly 

therefrom, 
a plurality of rails which are joined to the face and to the crown and which 

extend rearwardly from the sole portion of the face and downwardly from 
the crown, the rails being constructed and arranged to permit weight of 

the clubhead to be positioned in the upper portion of the toe portion and 
the lower portion of the heel portion. 
The clubhead of claim 1 including a toe wall joined to the toe portion of 
the face and to the crown. 
The clubhead of claim 1 in which the crown is provided with a plurality of 
bores to remove weight from selected portions of the crown. 
The clubhead of one of the claims 1 to 3 in which at least one of the rails 
is provided with an opening to remove weight from a portion of said one 

rail. 
The clubhead of one of the claims 1 to 4 in which the crown includes a 
top surface which is provided with a plurality of grooves which extend 

rearwardly from adjacent the face to remove weight from selected 
portions of the crown. 
The clubhead of one of the claims 1 to 5 in which the clubhead is formed 
integrally by casting or by investing casting. 
The clubhead of one of the claims 1 to 5 in which the clubhead is formed 
integrally by die casting. 
The clubhead of one of the claims 1 to 7 in which the face is thicker in the 
toe portion of the face or in the heel portion of the face than in the middle 

of the face. 
The clubhead of one of the claims 1 to 8 in which the rails provide the 
clubhead with a plurality of recesses behind the face and between the 

rails, the thickness of the face at one of the recesses being different than 
the thickness of the face at another of the recesses. 
The clubhead of claim 9 in which the clubhead is provided with recesses 
in the toe portion, the heel portion, and in an intermediate portion 

between the toe and heel portions, the thickness of the face at the toe 
recess being greater than the thickness of the face at the intermediate 

recess. 
The clubhead of the claim 9 in which the clubhead is provided with 
recesses in the toe portion, the heel portion, and in an intermediate 

portion between the toe and heel portions, the thickness of the face at the 
heel recess being greater than the thickness of the face at the 

intermediate recess. 
The clubhead of claim 9 in which the clubhead is provided with recesses 
in the toe portion, the heel portion, and in an intermediate portion 

between the toe and heel portions, the thickness of the face at the toe 
and heel recesses being greater than the thickness of the face at the 

intermediate recess. 
The clubhead of one of the claims 1 to 12 in which one of the rails 
extends from the toe portion of the face and another of the rails extends 

from a portion of the face between the toe and heel portions, said one rail 
being thicker than said other rail. 
The clubhead of one of the claims 1 to 12 in which one of the rails 
extends from the heel portion of the face and another of the rails extends 

from a portion of the face between the toe and heel portions, said one rail 
being thicker than said other rail.
