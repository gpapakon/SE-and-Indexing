<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a photographic material 
comprising on a support a layer combining photosensitive and image 

receiving properties, said layer containing (i) light sensitive 
silver halide particles, (ii) a substantially light insensitive 

silver salt having a speed of at least a factor 10 less than said 
light sensitive silver halide particles and (iii) physical 

development nuclei. The present invention further provides a method 
for obtaining an image with said photographic material according to 

the silver salt diffusion transfer process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mono-sheet silver salt 
diffusion transfer material and method for producing direct-positive 
images therewith. In silver halide photography a photographic method, according to 
which a positive image is made without the use of a negative image 
or an intermediary process producing a negative image, is called a 
direct-positive method and a photographic light-sensitive element is 
called a direct-positive element. Two main types for producing direct-positive image are known. 
According to a first class use is made of a photographic element 
containing a direct positive silver halide emulsion. Such types of 
photographic elements are disclosed in for example US-P-3,364,026, 
US-P-3,501,305, US-P-2,456,953 and US-P-3,761,276. These types of 
photographic material are of rather low speed. According to the second class use is made of the silver salt 
diffusion transfer method. The principles of the silver complex 
diffusion transfer reversal process, hereinafter called DTR-process, 
have been described e.g. in US-P-2,352,014 and the book 
"Photographic Silver Halide Diffusion Processes" by André Rott and 
Edith Weyde - The Focal Press -London and New York, (1972). According to the DTR process, a silver complex salt is image-wise 
transferred by diffusion from the image-wise exposed silver 
halide emulsion layer into the image receiving layer, where it is 
converted to a silver image usually in the presence of physical 
development nuclei. For this purpose, the image-wise exposed silver 
halide emulsion layer is developed in the presence of a developing 
agent and non-developed silver halide is converted by means of a 
silver halide complexing agent into a soluble silver complex salt 
while in contact with an image receiving layer. At the exposed areas of the silver halide emulsion layer the 
silver halide is developed (chemical development) and thus cannot be 
dissolved any more to diffuse to the receiving layer. At the unexposed areas of the silver halide emulsion layer the  
 
silver halide is converted to a soluble silver complex salt and is 
transferred to the receiving layer, where it forms a silver image 
usually in the presence of physical development nuclei. The DTR process includes (a) a so-called "two-sheet" type where 
the silver halide emulsion layer and the image receiving layer are 
contained on separate supports and are brought in contact with each 
other at the time of diffusion transfer development to produce the 
silver image in the receiving sheet and
