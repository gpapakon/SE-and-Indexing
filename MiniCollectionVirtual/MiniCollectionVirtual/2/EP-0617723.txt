<ABSTRACT>
A printing compound and method of producing three-dimensional signs and lettering and Braille reading materials is disclosed. The printing compound includes an ultraviolet radiation curable resin and a filler mixed with the resin to form a paste. The resin can be an acrylated urethane oligomer or an epoxidized oil. The compound is applied to a substrate manually or by a computer controlled dispensing apparatus. The compound is subjected to ultraviolet radiation to cure quickly allowing for mass production.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to printing compounds and
methods of making three-dimensional signs and lettering,
including Braille and other tactile reading material.Visually impaired individuals, children and learning
disabled individuals are taught to read and do read using
tactile materials that contain a raised image of the object
being taught. The visually impaired who are learning or
using the Braille alphabet to read, also benefit from
tactile materials that supplement and explain, by being
placed alongside the Braille representation of the image.
Consequently, tactile reading materials, whether used alone
or in conjunction with Braille materials, are critical to
the learning process of visually impaired and learning
disabled individuals.Three-dimensional or raised images have also been
produced for normally sighted people, such as topographical
maps, anatomical displays and the like, as these items are
generally considered to be more visually pleasing and
informative than two-dimensional displays.In the past, these three-dimensional or tactile display
materials, such as maps, graphs, geometric figures,
letters, numbers and images - whether alone or also
containing Braille lettering - have been produced using a
thermoforming process. In this method, a metal or -lead
plate is tediously produced by hand. Following the
completion of this plate, a thin plastic sheet is placed on
top of the plate, and with the assistance of a
thermoforming press, or vacuum forming, the sheets are
formed to reproduce the original plate.This entire process is extremely time-consuming and
tedious and lacks accuracy and consistency. Two unfortunate
results flow from these limitations. First, the commercial 
availability of tactile materials used in instructional use
for the visually impaired and learning disabled is
extremely limited. Second, without tactile materials,
instructional use is often limited to Braille.This new invention directly addresses the limitations
that currently exist in producing three-dimensional signs
and lettering, including Braille and tactile images for the
visually impaired and learning disabled individuals.
Consistent and comprehensible reproductions can be produced
in a very short time without the tedious limitation of
current tactile reproduction methods. Accordingly, mass
production of three-dimensional or tactile reading
material, with or without Braille lettering is possible
with this invention. The present invention makes use of UV curable compositions. Previous uses of UV curable

<CLAIMS>
A printing compound which can be arranged in a predetermined
pattern to form a three-dimensional display sign and lettering, said

printing compound comprising: an ultraviolet radiation curable resin;
and a filler mixed with the resin to form a paste; the paste having a

consistency such that when applied to a substrate, it forms a bead
thereon. 
A printing compound as claimed in claim 1 wherein the resin
is an acrylated urethane oligomer including a photo-initiator.
A printing compound as claimed in claim 2 wherein the
compound includes one or more additional minor components

selected from the group consisting of: monomers, surface cure
agents, wax, adhesion promoters, powdered coloring pigments,

fluorescent pigments, nacreous pigments, sparkle pigments, dyes,
optical brighteners and glass beads.
A printing compound as claimed in claim 1 wherein the filler
is amorphous fumed silica.
A printing compound as claimed in claim 1 wherein the resin
is non-toxic epoxidized oil.
A printing compound as claimed in claim 5 wherein the filler
is amorphous fumed silica and further comprising a non-toxic

photo-initiator and a non-toxic pigment.
A printing compound as claimed in claim 1 and further
comprising glass beads mixed with resin and filler.
A method of making three-dimensional signs and lettering
comprising: providing a substrate (12), applying a printing

compound (20) to the substrate, said compound being a paste
formed of ultraviolet radiation curable resin and a filler, said

printing compound being arranged in a predetermined pattern
(18,18',18"); and subjecting the compound to ultraviolet

radiation.
A method as claimed in claim 8 and further comprising the 
step prior to applying the compound to the substrate of mixing

a dye or pigment into the compound.
A method as claimed in claim 8 and further comprising the
step prior to applying the compound to the substrate of mixing

glass beads into the compound.
A method as claimed in claim 8 and further comprising the
step prior to applying the compound to the substrate of

laminating the substrate with vinyl (16) so that the resin is
applied to the vinyl.
A method as claimed in 8 and further comprising the step
prior to applying the compound to the substrate of printing a

pattern (22) on the substrate, and wherein the compound is
applied by forming a bead on the substrate around the periphery

of the pattern.
A method as claimed in claim 8 wherein the resin includes
an acrylated urethane oligomer and photo-initiator.
A method as claimed in claim 8 wherein the resin includes
a non-toxic epoxidized oil.
A method as claimed in claim 8 wherein the compound is
applied to the substrate using a computer controlled dispensing

machine.
