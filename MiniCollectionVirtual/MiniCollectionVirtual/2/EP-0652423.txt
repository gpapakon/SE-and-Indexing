<ABSTRACT>
Light having a wavelength equal to or less than the 
cut-off wavelength of a sharp-cut filter (12) is cut off so 

that an output of a photo-sensitive device (10) corresponds 
to a stray light component when a wavelength control device 

(11) sets the wavelength equal to or less than the cut-off 
wavelength of the sharp-cut filter (12). By subtracting the 

stray light component from the output of the photo-sensitive 
device (10) when the photo-sensitive device (10) is to be 

measured an intensity of light having a predetermined 
wavelength, the stray light component can be removed from 

dispersion outputs of the spectroradiometer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a spectroradiometer used 
for measuring emission spectrum or spectral characteristics 
of an object to be measured. In the conventional spectroscope, such as Czerny-Turner 
type diffraction grating spectroscope, used in a 
spectroradiometer, a dispersion element such as a 
diffraction grating is generally used in a dispersion 
optical system. In such an optical system, a light 
component, which enters the optical system through an 
entrance slit and deviates from the optical system or the 
diffraction grating, is scattered by inner walls or inner 
structures of the spectroscope and exits through an exit 
slit without being dispersed. Furthermore, another light 
component, which exits from the diffraction grating and is 
not dispersed as zero-th order diffracted light 
corresponding to an image of the entrance slit, illuminates 
the inside of the spectroscope. Reflected light from the 
illumination is scattered inside of the spectroscope and 
exits through the exit slit. Such light, which is called 
stray light of the spectroscope, is detected by a detection 
system disposed in the exit slit side of the spectroscope 
with dispersed components. Thus, it is necessary to remove  
 
the stray light component in spectrometric measurement. To remove or reduce the stray light component, a 
double-spectroscope having a double dispersion system, a 
combination of a plurality of narrow-band filters, and a 
spectroscope, or a method for removing components except a 
component of a wavelength to be measured is generally used. In a double-spectroscope having the double 
dispersion system, the dispersion effect of the entire 
spectroscope is reduced and the energy from monochromatic 
light, which is received by the detection system, becomes 
much smaller than that of the spectroscope having one 
dispersion system. Thus, a more sensitive and stable 
detection system is required. Furthermore, the 
configuration of the double-spectroscope is more complex, 
since it controls two dispersion systems. This invention provides an improved high-sensitive 
spectroradiometer using a single dispersion system in which 
the stray light component is removed from outputs thereof, 
but the dispersion effect is not reduced. A spectroradiometer of this invention comprises an 
entrance slit from which light to be measured enters into 
the spectroradiometer; an exit slit from which dispersed 
light having a predetermined wavelength exits; a sharp-cut 
filter disposed in front of the entrance slit for cutting  
 
of
