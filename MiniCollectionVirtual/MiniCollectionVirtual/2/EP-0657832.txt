<ABSTRACT>
When information representing an application problem 
is entered from an input unit (4), a hardware 

specification interpretation unit (3) calculates an 
operation result representing how the consequent hardware 

operates with respect to the application problem according 
to the information representing the application problem 

and the hardware specification description provided from 
the hardware specification description unit (1). A 

fitness calculation unit (5) calculates a fitness 
representing how much the calculated operation result fits 

the application problem. A description modification unit 
(6) modifies the current hardware specification 

description on the basis of a fitness evaluation which is 
the calculation result.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an autonomous
evolution type hardware design system. More particularly,
the present invention relates to an autonomous evolution
type hardware design system in which a hardware
specification is autonomously evolved and adapted
according to its object of usage without manual hardware
designing.The application range of electronic circuits has
increased as large scale integrated circuit (LSI)
technology advances, giving rise to the need of various
types of hardwares of high circuit complexity. Since it
is almost impossible to design such a complex hardware
entirely by hand, various computer-aided design (CAD)
systems have been developed.Fig. 6 is a block diagram of an example of such a CAD
system. In the design operation using the system of Fig.
6, the designer first enters a hardware description
language (HDL) program via an input unit 21 to describe
operations of circuitry. The source entered is stored in
HDL source 22. HDL is only one way of example of 
describing the operation of circuitry, and various HDLs
can be considered such as an HDL describing the connection
of a transistor circuit, an HDL describing a netlist of a
logic gate, and an HDL describing a hardware specification
of a level higher than the circuit operation.The circuit description stored in HDL source 22 is
provided to a simulator 23 where grammatical description
error is checked. Next, confirmation is made whether the
described circuit carries out an operation as expected
with respect to an input signal by simulation. Then, the
description of the circuit is provided to a synthesizer 24
where circuit diagram data 25 or mask pattern data 26 for
LSI manufacturing is produced by a synthesizer program.Description of circuitry using an HDL must be first
carried out manually even if the CAD system of Fig. 6 is
used. Description of circuitry adaptable for its object
of usage by means of an HDL requires training and skill.In general, there are many ways of describing
circuitry by HDL that carries out an operation applicable
to its object of usage. Particularly, when the
architecture thereof differs from each other, the form of
description varies extensively. The eventual circuits
differing in description often have a great difference in
its performance such as response speed even when its
operation is identical. There is generally no way of 
identifying which architecture is most superior since this
depends upon the content of the input signal. Even a
skilled designer cannot easily determine the most superior
