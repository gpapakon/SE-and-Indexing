<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a unit for use in a heating 
apparatus for heating a room area and/or tap water, which 

unit comprises a number of components mutually connected by 
pipes, for instance a valve, a pump, a filter, a connector 

and a venting device, or a plurality or combinations thereof. 
Such a unit is known. 
The known unit is embodied as a metal panel. 
The invention now provides a unit of the said type 
which has the feature that the unit is formed in plastic by 

applying the "metal core" technique, and
 

   pipes and any components or parts thereof are coupled 
non-releasably to each other and the unit is thus formed 

integrally. 
By embodying the unit in plastic, optionally reinforced 
plastic, it is possible to also include tap water pipes in 

the unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a unit for use in a heating 
apparatus for heating a room area and/or tap water, which 
unit comprises a number of components mutually connected by 
pipes, for instance a valve, a pump, a filter, a connector 
and a venting device, or a plurality or combinations thereof. Such a unit is known. In the known art all necessary components are fixed to 
the unit. This fixing can for instance take place with a 
quick-acting closure or rapid-action coupling. Components 
suitable herefor are for example valves, pumps, connectors 
and venting devices. The known unit is embodied as a metal panel. The invention now provides a unit of the said type 
which has the feature that the unit is formed in plastic by 
applying the "metal core" technique, and
 
   pipes and any components or parts thereof are coupled 
non-releasably to each other and the unit is thus formed 
integrally. By embodying the unit in plastic, optionally reinforced 
plastic, it is possible to also include tap water pipes in 
the unit. With the known art this is not possible, as the tap 
water circuit is not closed and the panel would break down in 
the course of time as a result of corrosion. An additional 
problem is that in many countries the authorities responsible 
for providing drinking water object to this application. These stated drawbacks are peculiar to the use of 
metal. The use of plastic as according to the invention 
obviates these drawbacks. For the sake of completeness attention is drawn to the 
fact that the mentioned "metal core" technique is known. 
According to this method use is made for manufacturing 
plastic components which are complicated and/or provided with 
undercuts of a metal core pre-formed for instance by 
injection moulding and having the form, in any case the inner 
form, of the plastic component for manufacture. The metal has  
 
a melting point which is considerably lower than the 
softening temperature of the plastic. By heating to just 
above the melting temperature of the metal the latter will 
melt and can be discharged for instance by the thermal oil 
used, whereby the plastic component results. Practically all 
the metal can later be recovered for re-use. Complicated and 
undercut forms can in this way also be manufactured with 
simple techniques. The use of plastic has the further advantage that 
plastic generally has a considerably lower heat conduction 
than the metals employed for the units in the prior art. 
Particularly in the field of heating apparatus a thermal
