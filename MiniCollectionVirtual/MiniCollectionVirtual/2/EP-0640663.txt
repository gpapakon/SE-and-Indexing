<ABSTRACT>
An addition reaction type silicone rubber composition 
for injection molding compounded with an azo compound, carbon 

black, and at least one of cerium hydroxide and cerium oxide is 
disclosed. Silicone rubber moldings having a small compression 

set and an excellent flame retardance are obtained without need 
of carrying out a postcure after primary molding. Further, 

integral molding of the silicone rubber and a thermoplastic 
resin can be carried out.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silicone rubber
composition for injection molding, and more particularly to a
silicone rubber composition for injection molding, which does
not require a postcure after primary molding, has a small
compression set, and has an excellent flame retardance.As a silicone rubber composition capable of curing by
heating in a short time, there are a peroxide vulcanization
type silicone rubber which forms a rubbery elastic body by
crosslinking by compounding a silicone raw rubber comprising a
straight chain highly polymerized polyorganosiloxane with an
organic peroxide followed by heating and an addition reaction
type (platinum vulcanization type) silicone rubber which forms
a rubbery elastic body by carrying out crosslinking by the
addition reaction between a vinyl group-containing
polyorganosiloxane and a polyorganohydrogensiloxane in the
presence of a platinum catalyst, and these silicone rubbers are
widely used. In the former, it is required to complete the
crosslinking by secondary heating called a postcure after
carrying out the primary molding; and in the latter, in the
case of moldings which are used in a place to which a
compressive stress is applied for a long time, the postcure is
necessary to particularly reduce the compression set.Injection molding is frequently employed for the mass 
production of moldings. Thus, for generally rationalizing the
production steps of moldings, a silicone rubber composition
which can obtain moldings having a small compression set
without need of a postcure step has been desired. This becomes
recently particularly remarkable with the increase of the use
of integral injection molded products (composite moldings) with
various kinds of thermoplastic resins which cannot endure the
postcuring temperature of an ordinary silicone rubber.For solving such a theme, investigations have been made
on both the base polymer and various kinds of compounding
agents. As the former, there is, for example, a method of
bonding plural vinyl groups to each of both terminals of the
molecular chain of the base polymer as disclosed in JP-A-63-270763
(the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined
published Japanese patent application") and as the latter,
there are, for example, a method of adding a triazole compound
as disclosed in JP-A-2-242854 and a method of adding a vinyl
group-containing organosilazane as disclosed in JP-A-63-268764.
However, in the former method, the synthesis of the base
polymer is complicated to increase the cost and in the latter
