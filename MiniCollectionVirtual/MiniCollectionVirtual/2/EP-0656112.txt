<DESCRIPTION>
 Chlorine SensorThis invention relates to the quantitati e determination of chemical oxidizing and reducing agents in a fluid (gas or liquid) environment. More particularly, the invention relates to the determination of chemical oxidizing and reducing agents by means of a sensor or detector apparatus employing an ion-exchange membrane.A sensor apparatus of this type is disclosed in commonly-assigned United States Patent No. 4,333,810 to Wolcott et al. (the '810 patent), wherein a tubular ion-exchange membrane is employed to contain an electrolyte solution, and to separate a first electrode in contact with its fluid environment and wrapped around the membrane and a second electrode positioned in the electrolyte solution. Means are provided for measuring a flow of electrical current between the first and second electrodes attributable to the oxidizing or reducing agents coming into contact with the first electrode, for example, a microammeter or resistor in parallel combination with a voltmeter. An additional means for imposing a voltage across the electrodes is provided in certain embodiments, for example, a battery or an alternating power source stepped down with a direct current transformer or rectifier, and a chart recorder or the like may be employed in conjunction with the current measuring means.A second membrane-based, galvanic-type sensor apparatus known to us employs a fa membrane for containing an electrolyte solution and for separating a first electrode in contact with the fluid environment and a second electrode in the electrolyte solution. The first electrode in this flat-membrane design is in the form of a flat wire mesh, and the remainder of the apparatus apart from the sensor proper may be as described in the '810 patent.An amperometric variation of this second, flat-membrane design employs a third, driven electrode to supply the current that would otherwise be supplied by the corrosion of the second or reference electrode, whereby the effective lifetime of the second electrode may be substantially extended. This three-electrode, flat-membrane sensor apparatus is depicted in Figure 1 , and its construction and manner of operation will be described in detail below.As discussed in the '810 patent, the art prior to the '810 patent had the electrodes forming a part of the electrochemical cell in the sensors separated from each other by a porous layer. This porous layer design, however, permitted a substantial diffusion of a sample throughout the electrolyte between the electrodes, so that
