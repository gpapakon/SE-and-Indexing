<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an improved 
polyethylene terephthalate photographic film base 

having excellent dimensional stability, optical clarity 
and mechanical strength while also possessing
 a 
crystalline configuration that enables finishing by 

cutting, chopping or perforating techniques at reduced 
fracture resistance with decreased generation of dirt.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polyethylene 
terephthalate photographic film base having improved 
properties and to a method of preparing the same. More 
particularly, the invention relates to polyethylene 
terephthalate photographic film base having improved 
properties with regard to cutting, chopping and 
perforating. Polyethylene terephthalate films exhibit 
excellent properties for use as photographic film base 
with regard to transparency, mechanical strength, 
dimensional stability, resistance to thermodeformation, 
curling and water. However, polyethylene terephthalate 
films are extremely tough and not well suited for 
finishing operations including slitting, chopping and 
perforating processes which are required in the 
preparation of photographic film. In applications, such as packaging, adhesive 
tapes, substrates for magnetic tapes, cards and labels 
and the like where optical properties of the article of 
manufacture are of no consequence, it has been a 
practice to add various types of particles to the 
polyethylene terephthalate resin in order to render 
them more easily fabricated. Japanese patent 
publications 63235338, 1988; 63237927, 1988; and 
62172031, 1987 are illustrative of this technique. German OLS DE 3829239 published March 9, 1989 
suggests a magnetic recording film on a polyethylene 
terephthalate support wherein the cutting index (Z) is 
dependent upon the turbidity, the surface orientation 
and the difference in refractive index in the machine 
direction and the transverse direction of the support.  
 
Since the use is for magnetic recording, the support is 
not applicable for use as a light-sensitive 
photographic support because of the high turbidity 
value thereof. U.S. Patent 4,677,188 issued June 30, 1987 is 
directed to biaxially stretched transparent polyester 
film having excellent transparency and slipperiness; 
however, it contains no recognition of the need to 
provide films that are easily cut, chopped or 
perforated whale generating low quantities of dirt in 
the process. The invention provides an improved 
polyethylene terephthalate photographic film base 
having excellent dimensional stability, optical clarity 
and mechanical strength while also possessing a 
crystalline configuration that enables finishing by 
cutting, chopping or perforating techniques at reduced 
fracture resistance with decreased generation of dirt. 
This is achieved by carefully controlling the process 
of manufacture to produce a biaxially oriented 
polyethylene terephthalate film having

<CLAIMS>
A photographic film base comprising a 
biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate film 

having a planar birefringence of from 0.12 to 0.149. 
The photographic film base of Claim 1 
wherein the planar birefringence is from 0.13 to 0.14. 
A silver halide light sensitive 
photographic element having at least one light 

sensitive silver halide containing emulsion layer on a 
polyethylene terephthalate film support having a planar 

birefringence of from 0.12 to 0.149. 
The silver halide light sensitive 
photographic element of Claim 3 wherein the planar 

birefringence of the film support is from 0.13 to 0.14. 
A process for making a polyethylene 
terephthalate polyester photographic film base which 

comprises: 
   casting a molten polyethylene terephthalate 

resin onto a casting surface, 
   orienting by stretching in the machine 

direction, at a stretch ratio of from 2 to 4 and 
tentering in the transverse direction at a stretched 

ratio of from 2 to 4, heatsetting the tentered film 
with constraint at a temperature of 200°C. to 250°C. 

and detentering the heatset film by permitting the 
width to shrink from 2 to 20 percent. 
The process of Claim 5 wherein in the 
detentering step, the film is permitted to shrink in 

width from 10 to 20 percent. 
The process of Claim 6 wherein in the 
detentering step, the film is permitted to shrink in 

width from 12 to 18 percent. 
The process of Claim 5 wherein the molten 
polyester is cast at a temperature of from 270°C. to 

300°C., has an inherent viscosity of from 0.5 to 0.8, 
the casting surface has a temperature of from 40°C. to 

70°C., the film is at a temperature of 70°C. to 130°C. 
 

in the orienting steps in both the machine and 
transverse direction. 
The process of Claim 8 wherein the 

temperature of the film in both orienting steps is from 
90°C. to 105°C.
