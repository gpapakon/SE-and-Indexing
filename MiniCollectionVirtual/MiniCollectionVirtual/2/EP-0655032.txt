<ABSTRACT>
An anti-copy film or coating for originals or documents consists of transparent film material with a plurality of spaced, at least partly opaque and possibly reflective regions arranged as coverings on the foil surfaces substantially staggered in the horizontal plane and especially mutually parallel, so that the information on an original beneath them is hidden when viewed vertically and visible when viewed from a predetermined angle. Suitable production methods permit the use of photographic methods.

A process for the production of an anti-copy film 
or layer (S) for documents, against copying the latter in 

a copying apparatus, comprising at least one film or at 
least one layer (S) of transparent material having a 

multiplicity of at least partially opaque line- or strip-like 
screens which are arranged at distances from one 

another and whose planes are arranged in approximately 
the same predefined position relative to the surfaces of 

the film or layer (S), or which are produced with a 
defined offset to one another, so that the anti-copy film 

is essentially opaque at a viewing angle perpendicular to 
the surfaces of the film(s) or layer(s) (S) of the anti-copy 

film and is essentially transparent at a predefined 
viewing angle to the surfaces of the film(s) or layer(s) 

(S) of the anti-copy film, which comprises producing the 
screens (A1, A2) in the defined offset arrangements on 

the film or layer (S) by printing and/or photographically 
by applying a photosensitive coating (B1) to one side of 

the film or layer (S), exposing the coating through a 
mask (M1) and subsequently developing the exposed coating, 

and applying a further photosensitive coating (B2) 
to the other side of the film or layer (S), exposing the 

coating through a mask (M2) and subsequently developing 
the exposed coating. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
further photosensitive coating (B2) is exposed through 

the first, already developed coating (B1).

at most only slight, overlapping of the screens (A1, A2). 
A process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the exposure is carried out by means of divergent 

light radiation, so that there is essentially overlapping 
of the screens (A1', A2').

A1', A2') are formed by exposure of the two coatings 
through a mask (M) from the negative resist coating (BN) 

side and by washing out the two coatings (BN, BP).

wherein the photosensitive coating material is a photographic 

emulsion. 
A process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6, 
wherein the photosensitive coating material is a plastic

before application, in particular by admixing a colorant. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein a non-opaque 
coating material is provided with opaque material, 

at the raised or indented areas, after application, 
exposure and development. 
A process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 10, 
wherein the finished coatings containing the screens are 

sealed by means of a transparent coat of lacquer. 
An anti-copy film or layer (S) for documents, 
against copying the latter in a copying apparatus, comprising 

at least one film or at least one layer of 
transparent material having a multiplicity of at least 

partially opaque areas which are arranged at distances  
 

from one another and whose planes are arranged in 
approximately the same predefined position relative to 

the surfaces of the film or layer (S), so that the anti-copy 
film is essentially opaque at a viewing angle 

approximately perpendicular to the surfaces of the 
film(s) or layer(s) (S) of the anti-copy film and is 

essentially transparent at a predefined viewing angle to 
the surfaces of the film(s) or layer(s) (S) of the anti-copy 

film, and so that each area is formed from at least 
first opaque screens (A1) on one of the surfaces of the 

film(s) or layer(s) (S) and at least second opaque 
screens (A2) on at least one of the other surfaces of the 

film(s) or layer(s) (S), and so that the at least first 
and second screens (A1 and A2) are arranged essentially 

horizontally, wherein, for an overall thickness of the 
film(s) or the layer(s) (S) of from 5 to 100 µm and an 

effective optical aperture angle of a copying apparatus

A2) are in the range from 1.75 to 180 µm, in particular
