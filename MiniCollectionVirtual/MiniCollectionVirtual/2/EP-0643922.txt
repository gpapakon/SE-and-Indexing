<CLAIMS>
Process for preparing a flavouring agent, wherein:

cooked pulse seeds are fermented with a strain of

Baccillus subtilis
 or 
Baccillus natto
 for 1-7 d at 30-45°C,
0.5-5 % by weight of carbohydrate or a source of

carbohydrate assimilable by the said strain being
added to the seeds before fermentation,
a mixture is prepared comprising the said fermented
material, at least one reducing sugar and water,
the said mixture is caused to react by heating at 80-150°C
for 1 min to 4 h, and
the reaction product is dried.
Process according to claim 1, wherein the said pulse
seeds are soya or carob seeds optionally hulled and/or

optionally subdivided, in particular optionally crushed.
Process according to claim 1, wherein the said mixture
rich in proteins is inoculated with 0.5-2.0 % by volume of

a culture containing 5×10
7
-10
9
 germs of the said strain
per ml, and is allowed to ferment with aeration by humid

air.
Process according to claim 1 wherein, before
fermentation, glucose and/or sucrose, or a rice flour or

barley malt assimilable by the said strain are added to the
seeds.
Process according to claim 1 wherein, before preparing
the mixture for the said reaction, the fermented seeds are

suspended in water containing 15-19 % by weight of sodium
chloride. 
Process according to claim 1, wherein a mixture is
prepared having a water content of 35-55 % and comprising,

in % by weight of dry matter, 24-97 % of the said fermented
material, 2-40 % of sodium chloride, 1-4 % of added

reducing sugar, 0-2 % of a sulfur-containing substance,
0-15 % of monosodium glutamate and 0-15 % of sucrose.
Process according to claim 1, wherein the mixture is
caused to react by heating at 120-150°C for 1-40 min.
Process according to claim 1, wherein the said reaction
product is dried to a residual water content equal to or

less than 2 %.
