<ABSTRACT>
A photographic element contains a light-sensitive 
silver halide layer having associated therewith a 

coupler which is a pyrazolone compound with a coupling-off 
substituent at the -4-position, said compound 

having the formula: 

wherein each R¹ is independently a substituted or 
unsubstituted alkylsulfonyl or arylsulfonyl group; each 

R² and R³ is independently a substituent; R⁴, R⁵, and 
R⁶ are independently hydrogen or substituted or 

unsubstituted alkyl groups; m and n are independently 0 
or 1 but both are not 0; x1 and x2 are independently 0 

to 5; and y is 0 to 3; provided that each of R³, R⁴, 
R⁵, and R⁶ is selected such that the calculated log P 

of the thiophenol corresponding to the substituent at 
the 4-position of the pyrazolone is at least 4. The 

photographic element provides an improved combination 
of low continued coupling together with a magenta hue 

exhibiting a long wavelength of maximum absorption.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic 
elements containing magenta couplers comprising a 
parent 1-phenyl-3-anilino-pyrazolo-5-one and a 
phenylthio coupling-off group with both the parent and 
coupling-off group containing substituents providing 
enhanced photographic properties such as improved hue, 
reduced staining due to continued coupling, and 
increased dye-forming speed and efficiency. The use of magenta couplers comprising 1-phenyl-3-anilino-pyrazolo-5-one 
couplers containing 
phenylthio coupling-off groups at the 4-position are 
well known in the art. See for example U.S. Patent 
4,853,319 of Krishnamurthy et al. and other patents 
cited therein. While elements employing such couplers 
have provided certain advantages, there remain several 
shortcomings in photographic elements relying on these 
types of magenta couplers. These shortcomings relate to the dye-forming 
efficiency of the coupler, the speed with which the dye 
is formed, the dye hue, and the undesirable occurrence 
of staining during processing. The hue of the dye obtained upon completion 
of the coupling reaction is important because it 
affects the accuracy of color rendition and also 
impacts the printer's ability to produce an accurate 
print from the negative produced from the original 
exposure. The hue of the dye is a function of the 
compositional make-up of both the parent and the 
coupling-off group. Both the individual substituents  
 
and the combined effect of the different substituents 
selected can affect the hue. The parent substituents 
affect hue primarily through their affect on the 
chromophore of the dye while the coupling-off group 
substituents have a more indirect effect by influencing 
the local environment of the dye, particularly when the 
coupled-off group is not free to diffuse away from the 
dye and into the hydrophillic phase. Additionally, staining or nonimagewise 
coloration of the element is to be avoided. One way 
that staining can occur is through the phenomenon 
called continued coupling. Certain couplers are more 
prone than others to react with oxidized developer that 
is carried over with the film into the bleach bath. 
These couplers will then undesirably form dye on a 
nonimagewise basis causing a magenta stain. The speed and efficiency with which the dye 
is formed can present added problems. When a coupler 
undergoes coupling with a color developer to form a 
dye, the coupler goes through an intermediate stage 
wherein the oxidized developer and the coupling-off 
group are both annexed
