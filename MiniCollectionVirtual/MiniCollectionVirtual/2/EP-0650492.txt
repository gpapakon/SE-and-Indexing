<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are methods for reducing the degree of antigen induced inflammation in a sensitized mammal. The disclosed methods employ oligosaccharide glycosides related to blood group determinants having a type I or type Ii core structure wherein the administration of such oligosaccharide glycosides is after initiation of the mammal's immune response but at or prior one-half the period of time required to effect maximal antigen-induced inflammation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 REDUCING INFLAMMATION BY TIME DEPENDENTADMINISTRATION OF OLIGOSACCHARIDES GLYCOSIDES RELATED TO BLOOD GROUP DETERMINANTS.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention.This invention is directed to methods for reducing the degree of inflammation arising from a secondary immune response in a mammal due to antigen exposure (challenge) by the time dependent administration of an oligosaccharide glycoside related to blood group determinants having a type I [/3Gal(l→3)GlcNAc] or a type II [3Gal(l→4)GlcNAc] core structure.The methods of this invention are directed to the discovery that the reduction in antigen induced inflammation in sensitized mammals by administration of oligosaccharide glycosides related to blood group determinants having a type I or a type II core structure is critically dependent on the point in time when that oligosaccharide glycoside is administered.2.
