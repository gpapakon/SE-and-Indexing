<ABSTRACT>
A set of network terminals (T) 
connected by optical fibre to an exchange (C), in which the latter 

sends information to all the terminals (T) that is recognised only by 
those to which it is addressed and that transmit to the exchange (C) a 

number of bursts equal to the number of time slots allocated to them. 
The invention is characterised in that the network terminal (T) 
sends a burst of reduced length to the exchange (C) that is received by 

the latter in a broad range window, that the exchange (C) informs the 
terminal (T) of the additional delay required to situate it in a narrow 

range window, the process being repeated in order to situate it finally 
at a precise moment in such a way that when a complete burst is sent, 

it is received within the time slot allocated to this burst.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a digital burst communications system 
between an exchange and a set of terminals, based on TDMA practice, in 
which each terminal has to transmit its burst or set of bursts in 
perfectly defined time slots without any one of these time slots 
overlapping with those adjacent because the information in both would 
be lost. This invention has particular application in subscriber systems 
communication systems over optical fibre, in which the propagation 
delays are greater than the bit period used. There are various techniques employed in digital burst 
communications systems of the TDMA type in order to prevent the 
overlapping of bursts sent by the terminals and which should be 
situated consecutively, with the consequent loss of information of both 
bursts. In the majority of cases it is applied in radio communication 
systems like, for example, the DECT system, in which relatively wide 
guard zones are defined with values that cannot ever be exceeded by the 
maximum permissible delay for signals coming from any terminal. This method produces a loss of efficiency in the system that is 
not excessive because of its characteristics of burst length, bit 
period, maximum distance between base and terminals, etc., meaning that 
the guard zone, which, expressed in number of bits is sixty, is an 
acceptable loss compared with the number of bits equivalent to the time 
slot, which is 480. Nevertheless, in similar systems that make use of optical fibre 
and in which the bit rate is significantly greater, as the distances 
between the exchange and the terminals and the propagation delays to 
take into account grow, the solution indicated above for radio systems 
is no longer applicable without a reconsideration of the system that 
would involve major changes to it. Thus for example, the duration of a burst in the optical fibre  
 
subscriber loop distribution system developed by Alcatel, is more than 
400 times less than that of the DECT, whereby the maximum propagation 
delay of the optical signals through the fibre is much greater than the 
duration of the bursts; as a result it is necessary to determine with 
great precision the moment when the terminals have to emit their bursts 
so that these are received in the exchange at the instant defined in 
the frame. Consequently, the technical problem to be overcome consists in 
determining, in a digital transmission system over optical fibre 
between an exchange and a set of TDMA terminals, the moment when the 
terminals have to send their

SYSTEM FOR DETERMINING DATA BURST EMISSION TIME IN TDMA 
COMMUNICATIONS for subscriber distribution systems on optical fibre 

cable in which each network terminal (T) is continuously receiving 
information coming from the exchange (C) directed to all the network 

terminals (T), that is only recognised by those to which it is 
addressed and which transmit to the exchange (C) a number of bursts 

equal to the number of time slots allocated to them and characterised:
in that the network terminal (T) sends a burst of reduced length 
(RR) that is received by the exchange (C) inside a broad range window 

(VAR) previously defined according to possible maximum and minimum 
delays, 
in that the exchange (C), once having detected the reduced 
length burst (RR) mentioned, examines its position within said broad 

range window (VAR) and sends information to the network terminal (T) in 
question concerning how much it should delay the moment of emitting its 

reduced length burst (RR) with respect to the start of the broad range 
window (VAR), so that the reduced length burst (RR) is situated inside 

a narrow range window (VER), included within the aforementioned broad 
range window (VAR), with a very tight tolerance, and 
in that the exchange (C), once having detected a second reduced 
burst (RR), examines its position within the narrow range window (VER) 

and sends information to the network terminal (T) on how much it should 
alter the above delay of the moment for emitting its reduced length 

burst (RR), so that when it sends a complete burst, this is received 
within the time slot allocated for this burst.

permitted shift equal to the number of guard bits, a bit synchronising 

system is then applied in the receiver of the exchange (C) so that the 
data can be correctly recovered.
