<ABSTRACT>
The coil core (2) described includes means (24A, 24B, 24C, 25A, 25B, 25C) for guiding the coil wire (3) making it possible to lead the ends of the wires of the coil (30) directly above metal tracks (41, 42) of one or more electronic components (4) fixed to the core. In this way, it is possible to use a simplified winding machine (1), that is to say one not including mobile means for guiding the wire, and the movements of the winding head (12) of which are thus simplified.

Process for winding a core (2) comprising a first portion (20) provided 
with at least one recess (23) in which there is lodged at least one electronic 

component (4) provided with two metal paths (41, 42) and a second portion 
(21) about which the winding is to be carried out, said process having the 

following two steps: before and after a winding head (12) carries out a winding 
(30) about said second portion (21) of said core, the winding head (12) causes 

the two portions of wire (3) corresponding to the ends of the coil (30) to pass 
along guide means (24A, 24B, 24C, 25A, 25B, 25C) disposed on said first core 

portion (20), each portion of wire being then guided by said guide means in 
such a way as to be positioned facing a metal path (41, 42) of each electronic 

component, characterized in that each portion of wire is thus guided along a 
direction parallel to the direction of the turns of the coil (30) produced on said 

second portion (21) of core and is guided in such as way as to be positioned on 
or in the immediate proximity above a metal path (41, 42) of each electronic 

component when the wire is taut. 
Winding process according to claim 1, characterized in that said 
winding is carried out on a winding machine (1) comprising a Flyer-type 

winding head (12), said winding machine not comprising any other movable 
means for guiding the winding wire (3). 
Coil core (2) for application of the process according to one of the 
preceding claims, including a first portion (20) provided with at least one recess 

(23) in which is placed at least one electronic component (4) provided with two 
metal paths (41, 42) flush with the surface of said first portion, and a second 

portion (21) on which a winding (30) is to be carried out as well as guide means 
(24A, 24B, 24C, 25A, 25B, 25C) capable of guiding the wire (3) in order to 

position it facing each first (41) of said metal paths before the winding and each 
second (42) of said metal paths after the winding, characterized in that said 

guide means are disposed on either side of said recess or recesses along a 
direction parallel to the direction of the turns of the coil and comprise inclined  

 
guide surfaces and guide surfaces perpendicular to the plane of the metal 

paths (41, 42) permitting the wire (3) to be guided along the same direction 
parallel to the direction of the turns of the coil in order to lead it on or in the 

immediate proximity above said metal paths. 
Core coil (2) according to claim 3, characterized in that the guide 
means (24A, 24B, 24C, 25A, 25B, 25C) are made up of a lead-in guide means 

(24A), a lead-out guide means (25A), as well as lateral guide means (24B, 24C, 
25B, 25C), a portion of the side faces of first lateral guide means (24B, 25B) 

being aligned in relation to each first metal path (41), a portion of the side faces 
of second lateral guide means (24C, 25C) being aligned in relation to each 

second metal path (42). 
Coil core (2) according to claim 4, characterized in that the first lateral 
guide means (24B, 25B) and/or the second lateral guide means (24C, 25C) are 

composed of bulges of a flange (22A, 22C) of said core. 
Coil core (2) according to one of the claims 4 or 5, characterized in 
that the first lateral guide means (24B, 25B) and/or the second lateral guide 

means (24C, 25C) are composed of guide studs, projecting from the surface of 
said first core portion (20), being disposed perpendicular to the plane of the 

metal paths (41, 42). 
Coil core (2) according to one of the claims 4 to 6, characterized in 
that said lead-in and lead-out guide means (24A, 25A) are composed of guide 

studs, projecting from the surface of said first core portion (20), being disposed 
perpendicular to the plane of the metal paths (41, 42). 
Coil core (2) according to one of the claims 4 to 7, characterized in 
that the guide means (24A, 24B, 24C, 25A, 25B, 25C) comprise an upper 

portion of conical or semiconical shape and a cylindrical or semicylindrical 
lower portion. 
Coil core (2) according to one of the claims 4 to 8, characterized in 
that means (26A, 26B, 26C) for guiding the wire from the first portion (20) of the 

core toward the second portion (21) and vice versa are further contrived on an 
intermediate flange (22A) separating the two said portions of the core.  

 
Coil core (2) according to one of the claims 4 to 9, characterized in 
that it is made in one piece by injection of a synthetic material. 
Transponder for identification system provided with a core according 
to one of the claims 3 to 10.
