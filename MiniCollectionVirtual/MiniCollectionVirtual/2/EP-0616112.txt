<ABSTRACT>
A cooling and sealing arrangement in a gas turbine engine 
comprises a seal assembly (42,30) extending between nozzle 

guide vanes (20) and combustion chamber discharge nozzles 
(22). The nozzle guide vanes (20) have platforms (34,36) 

having extensions (34A,36A) which in one embodiment 
overlap the downstream ends of
 the discharge nozzles (22). 
Cooling air is supplied to the upstream edge portions of 

the platforms through holes (26,28C) in flanges (24,28) on 
the discharge nozzles (22). The seal assembly (42,30) 

defines a chamber (58,70) adjacent the platform extensions 
which is supplied with cooling air through metering holes 

(56,68) in the seal assembly. Cooling air exits the 
chamber (58,70) through holes (34B,36B) in the platform 

extensions to film cool them.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to axial flow gas
turbine engines, in particular to sealing and cooling air
supply structures for use between combustion chamber
discharge nozzles and nozzle guide vanes downstream of
such discharge nozzles.A conventional present day axial flow gas turbine
engine normally comprises, in axial flow sequence, a
compressor section, a combustor (which may be radially
disposed) in which compressed air from the high pressure
compressor is mixed with fuel and burnt, and a turbine
section driven by the products of combustion. In the case
of an aeroengine (excluding turboshaft aeroengines), all
the power developed by the turbine section is used to
drive the compressor section, which can include a fan
propulsor. In the case of a turboshaft engine, or an
engine adapted for electrical power generation or marine
propulsion, the turbine section has an upstream part which
is used to drive the compressor section, and a downstream
part comprising a power turbine on a power offtake shaft
which rotates independently of the rest of the turbine
section.Note that in the present specification, the terms
"upstream" and "downstream" refer to the direction of
compressed air and combustion gas flows through the axial
flow compressors and turbines of axial flow gas turbine
engines. Hence, for a component associated with a main gas
passage of such a turbine or compressor, the upstream
direction is towards the front of the engine and the
downstream direction is towards its rear.The products of combustion pass from the combustor
through discharge nozzles to the first stage of the
turbine through an array of nozzle guide vanes. These
nozzle guide vanes are supported and located both axially 
and radially in a known manner to cope with the dynamic
and thermal loads occurring during engine operation.The downstream end of the combustor must also be
located and supported in such a way that it can cope with
the dynamic and thermal loads which occur during engine
operation. Furthermore, the support and location of the
nozzle guide vanes and the downstream portion of the
combustor should be such that loads applied to nozzle
guide vanes do not impose loads upon the downstream
portion of the combustor and vice versa.US3670497 discloses a gas turbine engine having
combustion discharge nozzles, and an array of nozzle guide
vanes located downstream of the combustion discharge
nozzles. A seal assembly is provided for sealing between
the discharge nozzles and the nozzle guide vanes. The
nozzle guide vanes have platforms
