<ABSTRACT>
A electrochemical immunosensor system is provided 
which uses electrical signals to measure binding events. 

The system includes an immunosensor having a sensing 
electrode in contact with a fluid containing an analyte 

concentration. A quantity of antibodies or other 
binding agent is adsorbed on or otherwise affixed to the 

electrode surface such that a portion of the antibodies 
of the binding agent binds a portion of the analyte to 

form complexes on the electrode surface. Signal 
generating means develop an electrical signal at the 

sensing electrode such that a response current is 
produced through the sensing electrode. The response 

current has measurable signal characteristics which are 
dependent upon the number of complexes formed, and 

therefore the analyte concentration within the fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
immunologic measurement systems, in which antibody
binding is used to measure substance concentration
levels. More particularly, the present invention
relates to an electrochemical immunosensor in which
voltametric signals are used to convert immunosensor
binding events to a measurable electrical quantity.Immunosensors are a subset of the class of
biological measurement instruments commonly known as
biosensors. Biosensors typically consist of probes
containing biological recognition molecules. The
recognition molecules respond to the presence of certain
substances, and the response is then converted to a
measurable quantity. Biosensors thus provide an
indication of substance concentration without the use of
complicated laboratory procedures. An immunosensor is
a particular type of biosensor in which an antibody
serves as the biological recognition molecule.
Antibodies are produced in the human body to inactivate
foreign substances by irreversibly combining with or
binding the substance to form a complex. An almost
unlimited variety of antibodies are produced, each
specific to a particular substance. The term "antigen"
as used herein refers to any substance that can cause
the immune system to form antibodies. The term
"analyte" will be used to refer to any substance,
including an antigen, which binds with any other
substance to form a complex. Substances which bind
analytes will be referred to as "binding agents". An
antibody is one particular type of binding agent. Other
binding agents include receptors and affinity-binding 
molecules.The highly sensitive and selective nature of
antibody binding permits the immunosensor to accurately
detect minute analyte concentration levels.
Immunsensors are therefore useful in medical
applications involving the detection of hormones,
illegal drugs or other trace constituents present in
blood and urine. Furthermore, since antibodies can be
selected to bind to a wide variety of different
analytes, the immunosensor has the potential for
widespread application to many non-medical uses such as
industrial and food processing quality control,
monitoring of environmental pollutants and detection of
materials used in chemical and biological warfare.Despite these advantages and potentially widespread
applications, immunosensors are not commercially
available at the present time. A significant obstacle
has been the problem of accurately converting the
antibody recognition event to a measurable signal. As
a result, more complex
