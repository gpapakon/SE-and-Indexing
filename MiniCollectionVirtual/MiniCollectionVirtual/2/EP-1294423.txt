<ABSTRACT>
A wearable storage system (10) for pressurized fluid includes a pressure vessel (40) formed from a plurality of polymeric hollow chambers (50) having either an ellipsoidal or spherical shape and interconnected by a plurality of relatively narrow conduit sections (52, 56) disposed between consecutive ones of the chambers. The pressure vessel includes a reinforcing filament (46) wrapped around the interconnected chambers and interconnecting conduit sections to limit radial expansion of the chambers and conduit sections when filled with a fluid under pressure. The container system further includes a fluid transfer control system (76) attached to the pressure vessel for controlling fluid flow into and out of the pressure vessel. A gas delivery mechanism for delivering gas stored in the pressure vessel to the patient in a controlled manner is connected to the fluid transfer control system. The pressure vessel and the fluid transfer control system are incorporated into a wearable garment to provide an ambulatory supply of gas for the patient.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a storage system for pressurized fluids comprising the features of the preamble of claim 1.There are many applications for a portable supply of fluid under pressure. For example, SCUBA divers and firefighters use portable, pressurized oxygen supplies. Commercial aircraft employ emergency oxygen delivery systems that are used during sudden and unexpected cabin depressurization. Military aircraft typically require supplemental oxygen supply systems as well. Such systems are supplied by portable pressurized canisters. In the medical field, gas delivery systems are provided to administer medicinal gas, such as oxygen, to a patient undergoing respiratory therapy. Supplemental oxygen delivery systems are used by patients that benefit from receiving and breathing oxygen from an oxygen supply source to supplement atmospheric oxygen breathed by the patient. For such uses, a compact, portable supplemental oxygen delivery system is useful in a wide variety of contexts, including hospital, home care, and ambulatory settings.High-pressure supplemental oxygen delivery systems typically include a cylinder or tank containing oxygen gas at a pressure of up to 20.67 x 105 Pa. A pressure regulator is used in a high-pressure oxygen delivery system to "step down" the pressure of oxygen gas to a lower pressure (e.g., 1.73 to 4.31 x 105 Pa) suitable for use in an oxygen delivery apparatus used by a person breathing the supplemental oxygen.In supplemental oxygen delivery systems, and in other applications employing portable supplies of pressurized gas, containers used for the storage and use of compressed fluids, and particularly gases, generally take the form of cylindrical metal bottles that may be wound with reinforcing materials to withstand high fluid pressures. Such storage containers are expensive to manufacture, inherently heavy, bulky, inflexible, and prone to violent and explosive fragmentation upon rupture.Container systems made from lightweight synthetic materials have been proposed. Scholley, in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,932,403; 5,036,845; and 5,127,399, describes a flexible and portable container for compressed gases which comprises a series of elongated, substantially cylindrical chambers arranged in a parallel configuration and interconnected by narrow, bent conduits and attached to the back of a vest that can be worn by a person. The container includes a liner, which may be formed of a synthetic material such as nylon, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane, tetrafluoroethylene, or
