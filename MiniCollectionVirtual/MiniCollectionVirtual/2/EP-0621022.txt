punctal opening and into an associated canaliculus, said lacrimal fluid 
control device (20) comprises

 
   a tip portion (22) comprising a generally inverted truncated cone and 

being operable to facilitate placement of the lacrimal fluid control 
device at least partially through a punctal opening of a wearer and into 

a generally vertical portion of an associated canaliculus;
 

   a head portion (24) comprising a generally enlarged dome and being 
operable to prevent drift of the lacrimal fluid control device 

completely through the punctal opening and into the generally vertical 
portion of the associated canaliculus;

 
   a shank portion (26) integrally joined at one end to said head 

portion (24) and at the other end to said tip portion (22), said shank 
portion (26) interconnecting said head (24) and tip (22) portions and 

being operably engaged about its periphery by a punctal opening ring of 
tissue of a patient, said shank portion having,

 
   a diameter (28) adjacent to said head portion (24) which is less than 

the diameter (38) of said shank portion adjacent to said tip portion 
(22).

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to the subject matter of prior
United States Patent Number 3,949,750 entitled "Punctum Plug and
Method for Treating Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (Dry Eye) and Other
Ophthalmic Aliments Using Same"; and to United States Patent Number
4,915,684 entitled "Method and Apparatus For Modulating the Flow of
Lacrimal Fluid Through A Punctum and Associated Canaliculus."This invention relates to a device for treatment of tear-related
disorders. More specifically, this invention relates to an
improved punctum plug for treating keratoconjunctivitis sicca and
other conditions of dry eye and contact lens wearing problems as
well as pathologically dilated and constricted puncta. Keratitis
sicca or keratoconjunctivitis sicca or in laymen's terms "dry eye"
pertain to a continuum of difficulties which range from discomfort
to decreased vision and pain and in extreme circumstances
blindness. The causes of dry eye are aging, disease inflammatory
processes and prescription drug side effects. A common condition
is an inability to maintain a stable preocular tear film (PTF).In a healthy eye the PTF is spread over the cornea and
conjunctival epithelia by the upper eyelid and makes the surface of
an eye smooth and optically clear. The tear film is composed of
three thin layers which coat the surface of the eye. An outermost
oily layer is produced by small glands called meibomian glands 
which are located at the edge of the eyelid. This outermost layer
provides a smooth tear surface and reduces evaporation of tears.
A middle watery layer is produced by large lacrimal glands and a
plurality of small glands scattered throughout the conjunctiva.
This watery layer produces the largest amount of fluid and cleanses
the eye by washing away foreign particles and irritants. An
innermost layer consists of mucus produced by goblet cells in the
conjunctiva. This inner layer allows the watery layer to spread
evenly over the surface of the eye and helps the eye to remain wet.
The mucus produced by this innermost layer adheres tears to the
eye.Normally the PTF is formed by a cooperative interaction of
products from the memobian glands, the lacrimal glands and goblet
cells. Dry eye results when those glands produce less than an
adequate amount of tears or the tears are drained away or evaporate
too rapidly.Tear deficiencies cause chronic irritation of the anterior
segment, resulting in complaints of sandy, itching eyes,
conjunctivitis, metabolic disturbances of the cornea and extreme
cases, a loss of visual function.
