<ABSTRACT>
A power supply device for a communication 
apparatus includes a main power supply for supplying 

electric power to respective units of a communication 
apparatus main body, a main power supply control unit 

for ON/OFF-controlling the main power supply, and a 
battery for supplying electric power to the main power 

supply control unit. When the main power supply is ON, 
the main power supply control unit receives power 

supply from the main power supply. When the main power 
supply is OFF, the main power supply control unit 

receives power supply from the battery.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
power supply device and method suitable for, e.g., a
facsimile apparatus having a standby state.Conventionally, an apparatus having a standby
state such as a facsimile apparatus generally adopts a
switching power supply or the like as its power supply.
In a standby state or during operation, the switching
power supply is always enabled. Also, another
apparatus has a sub power supply for a standby state in
addition to a main power supply. In an apparatus of
this type, only the sub power supply is enabled in the
standby state, and the main power supply is enabled
during only an operation, thus achieving low power
consumption.In addition, the primary side of the main power
supply is directly controlled by a ringing signal from
a telephone line, thus attaining power saving. However, in an apparatus in which the primary side
of the main power supply oscillates to supply some
power (electric power) to its secondary side like in
the above-mentioned conventional facsimile apparatus,
electric power of about 10 W is consumed in a standby
state, and is consumed all day long for an auto-receive
function, resulting in a very large electric power
loss. In addition, the power supply generates
radiation noise, and adversely influences other
electronic devices.Severe limitations associated with safety
standards are imposed on direct control of the primary
side of the main power supply using a plurality of
means, and it is difficult to attain such control in
practice.A facsimile apparatus which has a printer function
as its additional function has also been developed.In such an apparatus, as for the printer function
as the additional function, since switching control
between a facsimile mode and a printer mode is executed
by a central control unit of the facsimile apparatus,
the main power supply must be enabled upon execution of
mode switching control. For this reason, the main
power supply must always be enabled.From JP-A-03 185 981 is known
a power supply device having the features
indicated in the preambles of claims 1 & 5. It is an object of the present invention to
improve a power supply device of a communication
apparatus.It is still another object of the present
invention to provide a power supply device and method for a
communication apparatus, which can attain power
consumption of almost 0 W in a standby state, and is
free from generation of radiation noise and problems
associated with safety standards.This objects are achieved
by a power supply device according to claim 1
and

<CLAIMS>
A power supply device comprising

a main power supply (116; 1016; 2016) for
supplying electric power to respective units of an

apparatus,
control means (115; 1015; 2015) for ON/OFF-controlling
said main power supply and
a battery (19; 1019; 2019) for supplying electric
power to said control means,

   characterized in that

said battery is a secondary battery wherein
when said main power supply is OFF, said control
means monitors a voltage of said secondary battery (steps

213; 1113; 2113) and turns on said main power supply on the
basis of the voltage of said secondary battery so as to

charge said secondary battery (steps 214; 1114; 2114).

power supply device is a power supply for a communication

apparatus.
A device according to claim 2, wherein said
communication apparatus comprises an image communication

apparatus.
A device according to claim 3, wherein said image
communication apparatus comprises a facsimile apparatus. 
A power supply method for supplying electric
power to respective units of an apparatus by means of a

main power supply (116; 1016; 2016), wherein the turning on
and off of said main power supply is controlled by a

control means (115; 1015; 2015), characterised in that

   when said main power supply is OFF, a voltage of a
secondary battery (19; 1019; 2019) for supplying electric

power to said control means is monitored by said control
means (steps 213; 1113; 2113) and said main power supply is

turned on by said control means on the basis of the voltage
of said secondary battery so as to charge said secondary

battery (steps 214; 1114; 2114).
