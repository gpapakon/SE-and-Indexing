<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to printed circuit boards having films for covering 
and protecting them from chemical, environmental and mechanical damage. Printed circuit boards commonly have protection from chemical attack 
and mechanical damage which may occur during portions of their processing, 
or in subsequent use. For rigid printed circuit boards protection is often 
provided by a polymer coating or covering, for example, an epoxy or polyimide 
polymer, applied to the exposed surface. For flexible printed circuit boards the protective material has the 
additional requirement that it be capable of being flexed without loss of 
adhesion or cracking. Protection in these cases is frequently provided by 
composite films known as coverlay films. These coverlay films generally 
consist of a tough, flexible, non-porous plastic film having a layer of flexible 
adhesive on it. The non-porous plastic film used in a coverlay film is often a 
polyester polymer film or a film of a polyimide polymer, such as Kapton® or 
Apical®. The adhesive used in a coverlay film is typically a synthetic polymer 
material having a low glass transition temperature (Tg), such as an acrylic 
elastomer resin. While these adhesive materials provide good flexibility and 
room temperature adhesion, they have limited chemical resistance, poor 
thermal performance, poor moisture resistance, and are not inherently self-extinguishing. 
Additionally, they have relatively high dielectric constants (Er) 
compared to the dielectric materials used in printed circuit boards for high 
frequency service. The adhesive of the coverlay must be sufficiently thick, 
typically more than 20 micrometers, in order to encapsulate and protect the 
printed electrical conductors and circuitry on the surface of the printed circuit 
board. The amount of adhesive required can raise the dielectric constant (Er) 
of the coverlay to as high as 4.2 to 4.5 and, when the coverlay is applied to 
the printed circuit board, may raise the dielectric constant of the whole  
 
assembly to undesirable levels thus increasing signal delay time and 
crosstalk characteristics of the assembly. The coverlay films described above are generally laminated and molded 
to the surface of a printed circuit board by application of heat and compressive 
force, most often in a vessel or container operated under 
vacuum. In EP-A-O 331 429 a lamination method is disclosed where an 
ETFE resin layer is applied to a circuit board as an adhesive layer and 
subsequent cover layers like an E-PTFE sheet,
