tomographic image of a subject to be examined including a 

radiation emitting device for emitting radiation in a shape 
of a fan beam to the subject, a radiation detecting device 

for detecting the radiation that has passed through the

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a computed tomography scanner 
that is adapted, for example, to non-destructive examination 
devices. Computed tomography scanners of this kind (hereinbelow 
abbreviated to CTs) include second-generation CTs of, for 
example, the traverse/rotation (hereinbelow abbreviated to 
T/R) system shown in Fig. 9 and third-generation CTs of the 
rotate/rotate system (hereinbelow abbreviated to R/R) shown 
in Fig. 10. In a second-generation CT of the T/R system shown in 
Fig. 9, an X-ray fan beam 4 of fan angle α that is output 
from an X-ray source 1 is directed on to a subject to be 
examined not shown, placed on a T/R table 3 corresponding to 
the scanning area. Meanwhile, T/R table 3, on which the 
subject is placed, is rotated as shown by an arrow R and is  
 
traversed as shown by an arrow T, thereby effecting 
scanning. The X-rays that have passed through the subject 
are detected by a detector 2. This X-ray transmission data 
of the subject that is thus detected is collected, and this 
collected X-ray transmission data of the subject is 
subjected to processing by a reconstruction device, not 
shown, to obtain a tomographic image of the subject. With 
T/R table 3, the necessary scanning area is guaranteed by 
the space between X-ray source 1 and detector 2. From the 
point of view of efficiency of utilization of the X-rays, a 
distance SDD between X-ray source 1 and detector 2 should be 
very small. Hereinafter scanning will be described in more detail. 
A prescribed distance traverse operation as shown by arrow T 
in Fig. 9 is performed such that T/R table 3 is made to 
traverse through the fan angle α of the X-ray beam. 
Indexing of the angle of rotation of T/R table 3 is 
performed with fan angle α, and data collection is performed 
by effecting rotation through an angle α for each traverse. The prior art second-generation CT of the T/R system 
described above is disclosed in detail in U.S. Patent No. 
5,027,378 issued on June 25, 1991. However, when a subject is placed on T/R table 3, if 
some parts of the subject stick out from T/R table 3, they 
interfere with, for example, the X-ray shutter, the 
collimator and the frame etc, not shown, on X-ray source 1  
 
side, or interfere with structural objects, not shown, on 
detector 2 side, with the result that scanning cannot be 
achieved. In general, T/R table 3 would be capable of 360° 
rotation. In the case of the third-generation CT of the R/R 
system shown in Fig. 10, the arrangement of X-ray source 1 
and detector 2 is the
