<ABSTRACT>
A pressure relief valve unit for venting storage tanks 
for volatile liquids, comprising a pressure relief valve 

(12) having a primary valve member (15) having a frustoconical 
portion (16) seating in a tapered valve seat (19) 

in a valve body (14), the valve member being guided for 
movement by ribs (21) on the inside of a valve body, 

these ribs being cut away above the valve seat (19) to 
provide a drainage channel (40) all round the valve element 

permitting water drainage to a single drainage aperture 
in the valve body.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pressure relief valve, and 
more particularly to a pressure relief valve arrangement 
for fitting to storage tanks of volatile liquids for 
venting of the storage tank. Although this invention is suited to use with a wide 
variety of volatile liquids, one example is petroleum 
products. The invention will be described in the 
remainder of this specification in respect of an example 
of petroleum products, but it is to be appreciated that 
the scope of the invention is not restricted to this 
application. It is common for petroleum products such as petrol, to be 
stored underground in large steel storage tanks. These 
storage tanks are normally vented to atmosphere so as to 
prevent an excessive pressure or vacuum building up in 
the tank, and also to provide a means of venting the tank 
during filling. It is well known that evaporation takes place, even in 
underground storage tanks, and this evaporation can be 
extremely significant. The rate of evaporation depends 
upon the location of both the tanks and the vent pipes, 
prevailing climatic conditions including temperature and 
wind, and elevation above sea-level. In most petroleum fuel tanks it is common to use a vent 
pipe which has a discharge point well above ground level. 
These vent pipes are normally fitted with an updraft vent  
 
cowl which directs the vapours upwardly and away from 
the discharge point of the vent pipe. However, updraft 
vent cowls, particularly where the cowl is situated in a 
windy location, often result in a slight vacuum being 
drawn on the storage container. This then causes 
continuous outward flow and further evaporation of fluid 
from within the storage tank. It is well known to provide some form of valving 
arrangement on a vent pipe so as to provide the necessary 
pressure relief which at the same time preventing 
unnecessary vapour loss. An example of such a valve 
arrangement is known from Australian Patent Specification 
No. 559799. Such a valve arrangement typically comprises 
both a positive pressure relief valve and a vacuum relief 
valve. In the above-numbered specification the positive pressure 
relief valve comprises a weighted ball seating on a 
sealing surface. Should a build up of pressure occur 
within the storage tank, the ball is designed to lift 
away from the sealing surface at a predetermined pressure, 
dependent on the weight of the ball, thereby relieving 
pressure within the tank. The vacuum relief valve allows atmospheric air to flow 
into the storage tank should a

<CLAIMS>
A pressure relief valve arrangement for venting 
volatile liquid storage tanks, comprising a pressure 

relief valve (12) having a primary valve element (15) 
comprising a cylindrical portion and a frusto-conical 

portion (16) seating in a tapered valve seat (19) in a 
valve body (14) incorporating a port (11) for fitting to 

the tank vent, characterised in that the primary valve 
element is surrounded by a drainage channel (40) providing 

for drainage of water from any point around the valve 
element to a single drainage aperture. 
An arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the cylindrical portion of the primary valve element 

is guided by means of ribs (21) for movement in the valve 
body (14), the said drainage channel interconnecting the 

spaces between the ribs. 
An arrangement according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the ribs are provided on the inside wall of a cast 

valve body, and have regions machined away above the 
valve seat (19) to provide the drainage channel (40). 
An arrangement according to claim 1 or claim 2 or 
claim 3, characterised in that the drainage channel (40) 

has a flat surface inclined towards the drainage aperture. 
An arrangement according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the frusto-conical portion (16) 

has at least one water collection recess or indentation 
(25) for receiving condensate locating between the frusto-conical 

surface and the valve seat (19). 
An arrangement according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the valve body (14) also incorporates 

a vacuum relief valve (13). 
An arrangement according to claim 6, characterised 
in that the vacuum relief valve (13) comprises a primary 

valve element having a stem (26) and a bottom plate (27) 
seating on a sealing surface. 
An arrangement according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the pressure relief valve (12) 

incorporates in the primary valve element (15) a secondary 
valve (28) for low differential pressure relief. 
An arrangement according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the valve element of the vacuum valve also incorporates 

a secondary valve (28) for low differential vacuum 
relief. 
An arrangement according to claim 8 or claim 9, 
characterised in that the or each secondary valve (28) is 

constituted by a valve seat (31) accommodated in a conduit 
in the primary valve element, the seat having a bleed 

aperture (32) normally closed by a ball-shaped movable 
valve element (30).
