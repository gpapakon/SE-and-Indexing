<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel electrically conductive 
polymer complexes, electrically conductive resists, uses 
thereof and structures fabricated therewith. More 
particularly, this invention relates to water-soluble, 
electrically conductive substituted and unsubstituted polymer 
complexes and their use as, interalia, electrical discharge 
layers, resists, discharge layers for electron-beam 
lithography and SEM (scanning electron microscope) inspection, 
and as coatings (especially radiation-curable coatings), for 
electrostatic charge (ESC) and electrostatic discharge (ESD) 
applications. In electron-beam lithography using organic resists, which are 
insulators, there can arise an accumulation of charge during 
the writing process due to the absence of an adequate 
conducting path for immediate bleed-off of the electrons. 
This charging can result in beam pattern displacement 
deflection, loss of accuracy in pattern-to-pattern-overlay, or 
in extreme cases a catastrophic discharge of voltage. Traditionally, suggestions to circumvent this problem have 
included the use of a discharge layer in the form of a 
conductor below or above the resist coating. The layer could 
be in the form of thin evaporated or sputtered metal coatings, 
indium-tin oxide films, or amorphous carbon films produced by 
chemical vapor deposition processes. Although effective in 
some contexts, these methods are not universally ideal since 
the processes involved in their utilization tend to influence 
negatively the performance of the resist, and in some cases 
are difficult to remove.  
 It is also useful to provide materials that can alleviate 
electrostatic charging (that is, the unwanted accumulation of 
static electricity which becomes capable of attracting 
unwanted airborne particles to e.g. cathode ray tube screens 
and electronic component carriers), and alleviate 
electrostatic discharge, in which static electricity is 
suddenly released in a discharge that can distort the 
performance of electronic devices and even damage or destroy 
electronic components. A material that can facilitate the 
application and creation of such materials would be useful. JP-A-63 215 722, 8 September 1988, discloses electroconductive 
polyaniline type compounds for electronic devices obtained 
from aniline, and polystyrene sulphonic acid. The compounds 
are produced by polymerising aniline compounds in the presence 
of high molecular anionic electrolytes. The anionic 
electrolytes include e.g. poly(meth)acrylic acid anion, 
polyvin
