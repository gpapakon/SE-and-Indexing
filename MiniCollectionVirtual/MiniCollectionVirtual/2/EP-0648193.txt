<ABSTRACT>
A process and system are disclosed for purifying waste water, in particular from motor vehicle washing installations (104, 106, 163). The system has a waste water-receiving first container (10, 110, 164) and at least one purified waste water-receiving or supplying second container (22, 112, 174). The first container (10, 110, 164) communicates over a shuttable first line (12, 132, 168, 170) with a third container (14, 116, 158) that can be filled under negative pressure, be automatically emptied when a predetermined filling level is reached and which in turn communicates directly or indirectly with the second container (22, 112, 164). A water jet pump (28, 128, 160) whose suction side (30) is linked to the third container over a shuttable second line (32, 134, 172) is arranged in the second purified waste water-containing or in another container (114). The water jet pump suction side can be linked to a sludge-receiving container (34, 118, 156).

A process for purifying waste water from a motor vehicle washing installation (104,
106, 163), said waste water is flowing through 
an open circuit in which said waste
water is collected in a first container (10, 110, 164) and pre-purified or purified waste

water is collected in a second container (22, 112, 174) from which the pre-purified or
purified waste water is supplied to the motor vehicle washing installation directly or

indirectly via a purifying stage, comprising the process steps:

Supplying the waste water from the first container to a third container by negative
pressure,
Emptying the waste water supplied to the third container when a given filling level
is reached,
Delivering the waste water supplied from the third container directly or indirectly
to the second container, where the waste water is flowing through a separator (16,

114, 156) either before it is supplied to the third container or after having been
emptied,
Generating the negative pressure necessary for supply by a water jet pump (28, 128,
160), water seal of which is purified or pre-purified waste water of the circuit.
A process according to Claim 1,
characterized in that

the solids separated from said circuit are drawn off by the negative pressure generated
by said water jet pump (28, 128, 160). 
A process according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that

the purified or pre-purified waste water collected in the second container (22, 112,
174) is degermed, for example by an ozone generator (182) and used as service water.
A system for purifying waste water from motor vehicle washing installations (104,
106, 163), comprising a first container (10, 110, 164) receiving said waste water, at

least one second container (22, 112, 174) receiving pre-purified or purified waste
water, a separator (16, 114, 156) through which the waste water flows as well as a

supplying unit for supplying the waste water, wherein the purified or pre-purified
waste water collected in the second container can be returned to the motor vehicle

washing installation,
characterized in that

said supplying unit is a water jet pump (28, 128, 160) generating negative presssure,
which is arranged in the second container (22, 112, 174) having purified or pre-purified

waste water or in a further container (114), said first container (10, 110, 164)
is connected via a first line (12, 132, 168, 170) adapted to be shut off to a third

container (14, 116, 158) that can be filled under negative pressure and emptied when
a predetermined filling level is reached, and said third container in turn is connected

directly or indirectly to said second container (22, 112, 174), the suction side (30) of
the water jet pump is connected to the third container via a second line (32, 134, 172)

adapted to be shut off, and a separator (16, 114, 156) is connected upstream or
downstream of said third container.
A system according to Claim 4,
characterized in that

a pre-filter stage (156) is upstream of said third container (158), said pre-filter stage
(156) having an all-round filter (157) disposed in the container and surrounding an

internal area, and a line (192) supplying waste water opens into the internal area, and
an area between the container wall and filter exterior is connected to the suction side
