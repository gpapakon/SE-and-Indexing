<ABSTRACT>
The photo-deviometer (10) includes a support structure (12), a deviometer disk (14) mounted on the structure provided with a central fixation opening (16) and includes an inner row (18) and an outer row (20) of fixation images (17) for deviometry and extraocular muscle dysfunction measurements. An electric selector and illuminating means are provided for selectively illuminating the fixation images. A recording device (22) such as a 35 mm camera, is mounted on the support structure and its lens is aligned with the center of the deviometer disk. An adjustable headrest (28) for fixing a patient's head is mounted on the support structure on the other side of the deviometer disk. The recording device, central fixation opening, and the patient's eyes, when the headrest is in adjusted position, provide central fixation with respect to the recording plane.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Photo-DeviometerField of the InventionThe present invention is in the field of strabismus for deviometry and photography. Background of the InventionStrabismus is an extraocular muscle disorder resulting in misalignment of the eyes. It is reported to affect one to three percent of the population in the United States (Helveston EM, "The Incidence of Amblyopia ex Anopsia in Young Adult Males in Minnesota in 1963" Am. J. Ophthal.. 60:75-77, 1965; Florm McNeomaier, RW, "Prevalence of Amblyopia" Public Health Rep. 8:29:34, 1966) . Ophthalmic photographers are often asked to document this ocular misalignment both before and after strabismus surgery. The resulting photographs are then used for comparative studies, case presentations, teaching tools, and publications. It is thus important to generate accurate and reproducible photographs on a wide range of patients of all ages and ethnic backgrounds affected with strabismus. The present invention is directed to a gaze fixation device for strabismus photography (nine gaze cardinal photography) and deviometry which is referred to herein as the photo- deviometer. 

 Devio etry, the measurement of strabismus in the cardinal positions of gaze, was initially developed as a method of documenting inco itance of strabismus, particularly in the case of a paretic vertically acting muscle.The first deviometer, the Owen's deviometer (3) , was designed in 1947 and consisted of a rotating arm (15.4 cm long) with a near fixation light set at 35.5 cm away from the patient. The angle of fixation remained at 25° from the primary position throughout the different positions of gaze. The deviation was then determined objectively by using the prism and cover test. The major disadvantage of the Owen's deviometer was the lack of an accommodative fixation target. Since adequate control of accommodation was not possible, inaccurate and variable measurements resulted.Methods other than deviometry for documenting gaze incomitance have been described. The most common clinical method is to passively turn the patient's head so that the eyes are in the intended positions of gaze. The problem with this technique is the difficulty in obtaining consistency of head position. A slight head tilt, chin elevation or depression can easily be introduced. This method is rarely satisfactory because of inaccuracy and inconsistent measurements.An ideal deviometer would allow measurements in the cardinal positions of gaze while the patient's head remains stationary. Also, it would be highly advantageous to

<CLAIMS>
Claims 1. A photo-deviometer comprising, a support structure, a camera mounted on the support structure, an adjustable headrest for fixing a patient's head mounted on the support structure and spaced from the camera, a deviometer disk mounted on the support structure between the camera and the head rest, the deviometer disk having a central fixation opening, the camera, headrest and deviometer disk arranged so that the patient's eyes when the headrest is in an adjusted position is in a central fixation position through the central fixation opening and in the camera's film plane, a plurality of fixation image targets on the deviometer disk facing the patient provided with a manually activated switch for each of the fixation image targets operable to illuminate individually each of the fixation image targets, the camera provided with a viewfinder having a central illuminated fixation image and having a mirror arranged so that the patient sees the central illuminated fixation image in the mirror while in the central fixation position, whereby, the patient while in the central fixation position can look at, fixate on and accommodate to the central illuminated 



fixation image and a photograph can be taken of the patient's eyes while so doing, a second mirror movable into and out of the central fixation position between the camera and the headrest, a video monitor positioned to view the mirror when the second mirror is positioned in the central fixation position for viewing a patient's eyes, and a video screen mounted on the support structure for viewing by a photo-deviometer operator.
2. The photo-deviometer of claim 1 where the second mirror is pivotally movable between the disk and the camera into a 45° angle relative to the central fixation opening, and the video monitor is positioned behind the disk and above the central fixation opening.
