<ABSTRACT>
A connecting piece (10) is fitted on an end lever (9) of the support part and is pivotably located on the wagon box on both sides around spaced link axes (4A,9A). The connector is arranged as a controllable drive (11) to actively change the distance between the two link axes. The support part (8) is constructed as a torsion rod spring with two crank levers (9) on each end which are attached to the carriage (4) by the connectors. The drives are adjustable independent of each other.

Anti-roll device for rail vehicles with a carriage 
body (4) resting on a bogie (1) via a suspension 

(5), comprising 

at least one supporting component (8) which is 
pivotally mounted in the vehicle, extends essentially 

transversely to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle and 
serves to support the carriage body (4) relative to the 

bogie against transverse inclinations (rolling) about an 
axis lying in the direction of travel, 
at least one connecting element (10), which is 
mounted on a lever (9) situated at the end of the supporting 

component (8) and on the carriage body (4) in 
such a way as to be pivotable at both ends about spaced 

hinge pins (4A, 9A), that by means of which 
connecting element the bogie and the carriage body are 

coupled to one another in a hinged manner and a pivoting 
movement of the supporting component which does not 

hinder deflection of the carriage body is forcibly 
brought about in the suspension in the case of deflection 

of the carriage body parallel to its own axis, characterized 
in that a controllable drive element (11) for the 

active variation of the spacing between the two hinge 
pins (4A, 9A) is assigned to the connecting element or 

elements (10). 
Anti-roll device according to Claim 1 characterized 
in that the supporting component (8) is embodied as 

a torsion bar spring with two crank levers (9) at the 
ends, each of which is connected in a hinged manner, by 

means of a connecting element (10), to mutually opposite 
outer sides of the carriage body (4), and in that both  

 
connecting elements (10) can be adjusted in length 

independently of one another by means of respective 
controllable drive elements (11). 
Anti-roll device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the supporting component (8) is embodied 

as a torsion bar spring with two crank levers (9) at the 
ends, each of which is connected in a hinged manner, by 

means of a connecting element (10), to mutually opposite 
outer sides of the carriage body (4), and in that only 

one of the connecting elements is adjustable in length by 
means of the controllable drive element (11), while the 

other is a fixed-length hinged support. 
Anti-roll device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that each drive element (11) 

is embodied as a hydraulic lifting cylinder with a 
differential effect, the two working chambers (11.1, 

11.2) of which can be connected either to a fluid feed 
(21) or a return (17) via a controllable directional 

valve (12). 
Anti-roll device according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that an arrangement for locking the drive element 

(11) in a particular position is provided. 
Anti-roll device according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the arrangement comprises a non-return 

valve (25) which can be released by supplying pressure, 
is arranged ahead of one of the working chambers (11.1) 

of the hydraulic drive element (11) and, in the shut-off 
position, blocks fluid return from this working chamber 

(11.1), it being possible to supply the release pressure 
from a supply connection of the other working chamber 

(11.2). 
Anti-roll device according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the arrangement comprises a mechanical 

non-positively acting clamping device. 
Anti-roll device according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the arrangement comprises a positive locking 

means. 
Anti-roll device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that each connecting element  

 
(10) and/or the associated drive element (11) is assigned 

a displacement sensor which detects an instantaneous 
actual position (x) of the drive element (11) and produces 

a signal which can be evaluated in an electronic 
control device (14) assigned to the anti-roll device. 
Method for controlling the drive elements provided 
on an anti-roll device according to Claims 1 or 9, 

characterized in that actual values of a transverse 
inclination of the carriage body (4) relative to the 

track being travelled are obtained from comparative 

measurement of the spacings set between the hinge points 
of the connecting elements (10), in that the influence of 

the elastic supporting component (8) on the actual value 
measurement is compensated computationally taking into 

account the excess centrifugal effect, the desired value 
of an inclination coefficient (S
w
), the loading of the 
carriage body (determined, for example, via pneumatic-spring 

pressures) and vehicle-specific constants, and in 
that a desired value of the transverse inclination of the 

carriage body (4) is determined by stipulating a desired 
inclination coefficient (S
w
) and a desired acceleration 
acting on the passengers from measurement data (speed of 

travel, lateral acceleration on the running gear or 
carriage body) and/or by evaluating track section data 

(curved radii, superelevation) stored in the vehicle and 
by activating the drive elements (11) on the carriage 

body (4) relative to the running gear (1,1J).
