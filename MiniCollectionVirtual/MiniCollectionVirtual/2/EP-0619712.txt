In the field of furniture, and office furniture in particular, an electric power supply system comprises a rectangular box structure having at least one panel formed in three parts (1, 3, 5) neatly fitting together and arranged in parallel in the structural metal frame. At least one of the outer panels (1, 3) has a longitudinal groove on the outer edge and is supported by a lip, and an intermediate strip of wood (5) narrower than the two outer panels rests on at least one lip and fits neatly between the two panels. Panels of this design and office furniture so equipped are also disclosed.
