<ABSTRACT>
A magnetooptical recording apparatus is provided for recording data in a recording region 
of a magnetooptical recording medium (1) and information representing contents of said data 

recorded in the recording medium. The apparatus includes a recording system (6, 15) for 
recording the data and information in the magnetooptical recording medium; a non-volatile 

memory (13) for storing the contents of the data recorded in the magnetooptical recording 
medium; and a controller (11) for renewing the information and storing it in the non-volatile 

memory at a certain time interval, to thereby facilitate a backup system and to suppress 
cancellation of the recorded data even upon a power suspension.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for recording data on a
recording medium such as a disc and a tape.A recording medium such as an optical disc, a magnetooptical disc and a
magnetic tape on which an audio signal is recorded as a digital signal is
widely used as a recording medium in which, for example, a piece of music, a
sound or the like may be recorded or reproduced. A recording and/or
reproducing apparatus has been developed for the above medium.In particular, recently, a medium (i.e., so-called mini disc) not only for
reproducing a signal but also recording a piece of music or the like by a user
is known as a magnetooptical disc. In case of a mini disc system, an audio
signal reproduced from the disc is once stored in a buffer, and the stored
signal is read out for a playback output. It is a so-called shock proof
function. Of course, such a technique may be applied to a production only
system such as a compact disc system.In such a digital recording/playback system, TOC (Table of Contents) is
recorded as supervisory information on the recording medium for controlling a 
recording operation and/or a playback operation of the data. The TOC
information is read out from the recording medium such as a disc in advance and
is held on the side of the recording/playback apparatus so. that upon the
operation, the TOC information may be referenced and the various controls of
the access position and the music may be executed.As described in, for example, EP 0 613 144 A2
the TOC information are provided in case of
minidisc where a P-TOC (premastered TOC) is recorded in the form of pits as
non-overwritable information and a U-TOC (user TOC) is magnetooptically
recorded so as to be rewritable in response to the recording/erasing operation
for the music or the like. With respect to the U-TOC, as described in
US 5 487 047 the data are
modified in the memory in response to the recording/erasing operation, and the
U-TOC area is rewritten on the disc at a predetermined timing in accordance
with the modified data.By the way, in general, a semiconductor memory IC is used as such a data
buffer or a recording means for holding the TOC information. Then, a storage
section used as the data buffer for realizing the so-called shock proof
function requires a large capacity (about 1 to 4 Mbits) to some extent.
Accordingly, a dynamic RAM (hereinafter referred to as D-RAM) is usually used,
which has a high degree integration in comparison with a static RAM (hereinafter
referred to as S-RAM). As described in EP 0 554

<CLAIMS>
A magnetooptical recording apparatus for recording data in a recording region of a
magnetooptical recording medium (1) and table of content (TOC) information for said

data recorded in said recording medium, comprising:

a recording means (6, 15) for recording said data and information in said
magnetooptical recording medium;
a TOC memory (13) for storing said TOC information, and
a control means (11) for updating said TOC information in said TOC memory (13),

characterized in,

that the TOC memory (13) is a non-volatile memory which is updated at regular
intervals during the recording operation and that after a power interruption during the recording operation said control means (11) writes the

TOC information stored in said TOC memory to the recording medium when power is
reconnected while inhibiting an eject operation.
The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said non-volatile TOC memory (13) is a
static random access memory.
The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said control means (11) includes means
for confirming whether a recording of the updated TOC information to said recording

medium has been implemented whenever the power is turned on so that the updated
TOC information which has been stored in said TOC memory (13) can be recorded to

said recording medium when said recording has not been implemented when the power
is turned on.
The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said control means (11) performs an
operation for updating said TOC information and storing it in said non-volatile TOC

memory (13) at a time when a track number of recording data changes.
The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said control means (11) performs an
operation for updating said TOC information and storing it in said non-volatile TOC

memory (13) when a recording of serial data occurs at physically spaced locations on
said recording medium.
The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said control means (11) performs an
operation for updating said TOC information and storing it in said non-volatile TOC

memory (13) whenever it stops said recording operation. 
The apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising means for prohibiting an
ejecting operation of the apparatus, said prohibiting means prevents the recording

medium (1) from being ejected during said recording operation of the apparatus until
the apparatus terminates a writing operation of said updating TOC information stored in

said TOC memory (13) to said recording medium.
