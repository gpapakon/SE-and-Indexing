<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (12) by which both tremolo action and 
string clamping and string intonation adjustment are 

achieved effectively and in a very small space in a guitar 
has adjustment screw shanks (42) threaded into bores in the 

inertia bar (20) or block of the tremolo, and bear against 
the heads (40) of pull screws (39) that are connected to 

string clamping saddles (22). The heads (40) of the pull 
screws (39) are received in recesses (37) in the inertia 

bar (20); the inertia bar (20) is connected to the bridge 
plate (13) by several screws (47) that do not interfere 

with the screw shanks (42). To adjust intonation, the 
bridge plate (13) is pivoted upwardly and a wrench (46, 

Fig. 5) is employed to rotate the screw shanks (42) which 
in turn bear against the heads (40) of the pull screws 

(39). Furthermore, the pull screws (39) are rotated to 
release positions while the bridge plate (13) is in its 

upwardly pivoted position. After intonation is adjusted, 
the pull screws (39) are rotated to lock the saddles (22) 

in their desired positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
Since Leo Fender's creation of the "Stratocaster"
(trade mark) guitar in mid-century, vast numbers of these
guitars (and copies of them) have been sold throughout the
world. In addition, there have been sold throughout the
world large numbers of string clamping vibrato devices that
were invented by Floyd Rose. It is greatly desired to
create a compact vibrato apparatus whereby the vibrato
device may be fitted or retro-fitted into the conventional
body opening of Stratocaster guitars, and which has
certain string clamping features of vibrato devices
invented by Floyd Rose, and has adequate and easily
operated string length adjustment for intonation purposes,
and is practical and economical.US 4742750 discloses a fine tuning bridge system and
vibrato device that is pivotally mounted on the guitar.
For each string there is provided individual tuning means
mounted in the upper surface of a bridge plate.According to this invention, a bridge apparatus for
guitars, comprises:
(a) a bridge plate;(b) means to pivotally mount said bridge plate over
and in proximity to the face of a guitar body;(c) a plurality of string engaging elements each
associated with an individual guitar string movably mounted
on the upper surface of said bridge plate; and(d) a plurality of adjustment means, movably mounted
beneath said bridge plate, each associated with a
respective one of said string engaging elements, adapted to
be individually manually moved in a direction parallel to
the longitudinal axis of the guitar strings, whilst being
mounted on said guitar body, to thereby individually alter
the length of the freely vibrating part of each of the
guitar strings.In a preferred embodiment the bridge apparatus further
comprises:
(e) means including spring means to connect said
bridge plate to said guitar body to counter-act the forces
of said strings;(f) a control arm connected to said bridge plate to
pivot the same away from a neutral position at which it
rests in response to the forces created on said bridge
plate by said spring means and by said strings;
The present invention provides a retro-fittable
vibrato device for existing (and original equipment)
Stratocaster guitars, which has the above indicated string
clamping and intonation adjustment.Adjustment elements are threaded into the inertia bar
(block) of the vibrato apparatus, and are adapted when
turned to pull the string saddles to desired longitudinal
positions; conversely, the adjustment elements are
adapted to progressively reduce the pulling forces on the
saddles so

<CLAIMS>
A bridge apparatus (12) for guitars, which comprises:

(a) a bridge plate (13);
(b) means (16, 17, 18) to pivotally mount said bridge
plate (13) over and in proximity to the face of a guitar

body (10); and,
(c) a plurality of string engaging elements (22),
each associated with an individual guitar string (32),

movably mounted on the upper surface of said bridge plate
(13); characterised by,
(d) a plurality of adjustment means (39,42), movably
mounted beneath said bridge plate (13), each associated

with a respective one of said string engaging elements
(22), adapted to be individually manually moved in a

direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the guitar
strings (32), whilst mounted on said guitar body (10), to

thereby individually alter the length of the freely
vibrating part of each of the guitar strings (32).
A bridge apparatus acccording to claim 1, further
comprising:


(e) means (20) including spring means (20a) to
connect said bridge plate (13) to said guitar body (10) to

counter-act the forces of said strings (32); and,
(f) a control arm (21) connected to said bridge plate
(13) to pivot the same away from a neutral position at

which it rests in response to the forces created on said
bridge plate (13) by said spring means (20a) and by said

strings (32).
A bridge apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, further
comprising a bar (20) connected transversely to the

underside of said bridge plate (13) and extending downwardly
therefrom for a substantial distance, said bar (20)

being adapted to extend downwardly into a slot or recess
(11) in the body (10) of a guitar, the relationships being

such that when said bar so extends said bridge plate (13) 
is in proximity to the face of said guitar body (10), and

in which spring means (20a) is connected to said bar (20).
A bridge apparatus as claimed in claim 3, in which
said adjustment elements (42) are threaded elements (42)

that are threadedly associated with said bar (20).
A bridge apparatus according to claim 4 ,further
comprising,


screw receiving means (37) provided on the lower side
of said plate (13, 20), said screw receiving means having

a plurality of threaded openings therein, the axes of said
threaded openings being generally parallel to each other

and generally parallel to said plate;

wherein the plurality of threaded elements (42) are
threadedly mounted in said threaded openings.
A bridge apparatus as claimed in claim 4 or 5, in
which said means to associate said adjustment elements (42)

with said string engaging elements (22) are pull elements
(39) that extend downwardly from said string engaging

elements (22) for respective engagement by said threaded
elements (42), and in which each of said threaded elements

(42) is a large diameter screw shank, each screw shank
being so disposed that an upper peripheral end edge thereof

is forwardly adjacent the lower end of one of said pull
elements (39).
