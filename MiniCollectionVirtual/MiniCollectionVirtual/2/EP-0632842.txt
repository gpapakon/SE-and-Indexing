<ABSTRACT>
A heat treatment process for metal articles in a roll type furnace is disclosed, in particular relatively thin for steel parts which easily warp when exposed to heat, such as ball bearing raceways, sheet metal rounds, blades and the like. The metal articles are heated in stages up to 800-850  DEG C in several pre-heating zones (I, II) with atmospheres containing free oxygen. Then the metal articles are heated in a high temperature zone (III) in a reducing atmosphere containing no free oxygen and run through this zone relatively quickly. The burners of the high temperature zone (III) are timed with shorter or longer periods, depending on the quantity of metal articles supplied and the amount of heat to be transmitted. The rolls are set in the high temperature zone (III) at a short distance from each other and the baffle plates (S, US) between the zones (I, II, III) are set at the smallest possible distance from the rolling track or the metal articles on the rolling track. The burners are located above and below the rolling track.

Heat treatment process for metal articles in a roll 
type furnace, in particular for relatively thin steel 

parts which easily warp when exposed to heat, such as 
ball bearing raceways, sheet metal rounds, blades and 

the like, characterized in that the metal articles are 
heated in stages up to 800-850Â°C in several 

pre-heating zones (I, II) with atmospheres containing 
free oxygen, and are heated afterwards in a high 

temperature zone (III) in a reducing atmosphere 
containing no free oxygen and run through this zone 

relatively quickly, that the burners of the high 
temperature zone (III) are timed with shorter or 

longer periods, depending on the quantity of metal 
articles supplied and the amount of heat to be 

transmitted, and that the rolls in high temperature 
zone (III) are set at a short distance from each other 

and the baffle plates (S, US) between the zones (I, 
II, III) are set at the smallest possible distance 

from the rolling track or the metal articles on the 
rolling track, with the burners being located above 

and below the rolling track.
