<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to surgical 
instruments and, more particularly, to a support 
structure for supporting an abdominal lift for use in 
laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic surgical procedures have been 
around for many years and have recently have become more 
available due to advances in technology relating to the 
laparoscope or video imaging system. They are much less 
intrusive to the patient than typical open surgical 
procedures. While an open surgical procedure may 
involve one primary incision that is at least 6-9 
centimeters long, a laparoscopic procedure typically 
uses smaller incisions, each only around 5-11 
millimeters in length. In open surgery, the surgeon 
cuts muscle. In laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon 
generally does not cut muscle. Because they are less 
intrusive than open surgical procedures, laparoscopic 
procedures have resulted in much shorter surgical 
procedures and recovery times. Laparoscopic procedures have typically 
involved insufflation of the abdominal or peritoneal 
cavity with carbon dioxide and/or other gases in order 
to create a pneumoperitoneum. The pneumoperitoneum 
establishes an open space inside the peritoneal cavity 
to enable the surgeon to move the laparoscope around and 
see inside. Typically, the pneumoperitoneum is established 
by puncturing the abdominal wall with a Veress needle  
 
and injecting gas from an insufflator through the Veress 
needle to a pressure of around 12 mm Hg. After insufflation, a trocar is advanced 
through the opening in the abdominal wall and into the 
peritoneal cavity. The trocar is a tube or cannula that 
usually has a gaseous seal to contain the carbon dioxide 
within the peritoneal cavity and maintain insufflation. 
The cannula is used for insertion of other medical 
instruments, such as a laparoscope, therethrough and 
into the peritoneal cavity. There may be difficulties associated with 
insufflation of the peritoneal cavity. First and 
foremost is postoperative pain which patients may 
experience in the abdomen or shoulder area due to 
migrating gas. This occurs when insufflation causes 
excess gas pressure in the peritoneal cavity. Excess 
gas pressure may also compress the pleural cavities thus 
making respiration difficult. Other possible 
difficulties associated with insufflation in 
laparoscopic surgery include subcutaneous emphysema, 
blood vessel penetration, etc. The attendant difficulties of insufflation 
have led to alternatives to insufflation wherein a 
pneumoperitoneum is established by
