<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a slicing machine for slicing thin planks from squared timber, means (24, 28, 30) for supplying the squared timber-supporting table (8) and/or the knife (12) with liquid are provided. In the case of the supporting table (8), these may be liquid outlet openings (28) incorporated in the table surface, and for supplying the knife (12) a spraying device (30) is expediently provided. The liquid which is preferably used is water. As a result, not only the friction resistance of the timber on the supporting table (8) is reduced, but with critical timbers deposits on the knife (12) are also avoided.

Apparatus for slicing thin blanks from squared timber comprising 

a supporting table (6) for the squared timber, subdivided into a 
feeding table (8) and a knife table (10) the height thereof being 

adjustable in relation to the feeding table, said knife table being 
provided at its front edge facing said feeding table (8) with a 

slicing knife (12), and 
forward feeding means (20) to advance the squared timber along its 
longitudinal direction across the supporting table (6) against the 

slicing edge (14) or the knife (12) and 
pressing means to press the squared timber against the supporting 
table (6), 
 
characterized in that means (24) are provided to distribute liquid upon the 

knife (12) and/or at least upon a section of the supporting table (6). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the means (24) to 
distribute the liquid are sprayers (30) disposed above the knife or, 

respectively, above the supporting table. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in that the sprayers (30), 
can be operated in a controlled intermitting manner.  

 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterized in that means (34) are 
provided to recognize the presence of a squared timber in the spray zone 

of the sprayer, said means being developed such as to act via control 
means (32) upon the sprayers (30) thus that said sprayers are only 

operated when no squared timber is present in the spray zone. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the means (24) to 
distribute the liquid are liquid exhaust channels (26) provided in the 

supporting table, in particular in the feeding table. 
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterized in that the liquid exhaust 
channels (26) are connected with a dosing feeder for liquids. 
Apparatus according to claims 1 or 5, characterized in that the liquid 
exhaust channels are connected with means to form a liquid under pressure 

and are provided at their outlets with controllable valve means. 
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterized in that the valve means 
comprise valve elements protruding from the surface or the supporting 

table which can be elastically pressed back into the supporting table, said 
valve elements being developed such as to release the liquid outlets when 

they are pressed back by a squared timber conducted across the supporting 
table. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that sprayers (30) 
according to at least one of claims 2 to 4 are provided to distribute the 

liquid upon the knife (12) and in that liquid exhaust channels (26) 

according to at least one of claims 5 to 8 are provided to distribute liquid 
upon the supporting table (6), in particular upon the feeding table (8).  

 
A process for slicing a plank by means of a device according to the 
preamble of claim 1, characterized in that, in operation, liquid is admitted 

to the supporting table (6) and/or to the knife (12). 
The process according to claim 10, characterized in that water is utilized 
as the liquid. 
The process according to claims 10 or 11, characterized in that the knife 
area is sprayed with liquid. 
The process according to claim 12, characterized in that spraying is only 
executed when no squared timber is present in the area of the knife. 
The process according to claims 10 or 11, characterized in that liquid is 
admitted to the supporting table (6), in particular to the feeding table (8) 

via liquid outlets (26) disposed in the surface of the table. 
The process according to claim 14, characterized in that liquid is admitted 
to the supporting table (6) when a squared timber is present on the table 

(6).
