<ABSTRACT>
A securing set (10) for drawer fronts with a securing bracket (24) which can be secured to the inside of the front (12) of a drawer and having a vertical longitudinal slot (26) open at the bottom into which can be introduced a retaining pin (28) projecting from the side-wall (14) of the drawer with a threaded hole (30) in its front surface. The retaining pin (28) can be inserted into the longitudinal slot of the securing bracket (24) and secured by tightening a securing screw (31) with a supporting plate (33) screwed into the threaded hole (30), so that the drawer front (12) is secured to the side-wall (14) of the drawer. In its region between the longitudinal slot (26) and the drawer front (12) the securing bracket (24) has an extended recess (40) with an oblique surface (42) running parallel to the longitudinal slot (26) and in a plane parallel to the bottom of the drawer from the base of the recess at an angle from the drawer front (12) on which is supported a complementarily obliquely sloped striplike edge region (38) of the supporting plate (33).

<CLAIMS>
A hardware device (10) for the adjustable fastening of a drawer front (12) to its sides (14), 
with a mounting member (16) attachable to the drawer front and a stud member (18), 

which can be releasably joined to the mounting member (16) and is provided on the 
corresponding drawer side, the mounting part (16) of which has a fastening lug (24) with 

flat sides running parallel to the drawer side (14) and projecting substantially at a right 
angle from the inside surface of the drawer front, in which an elongated slot (26) running 

vertically and substantially parallel to the inside surface and open at the bottom end is 
provided, and the stud member (18) has a mounting stud (28) projecting from the outside 

surface of the drawer side (14) and having a diameter slightly smaller than the width of the 
elongated slot (26) measured horizontally, and whose height projecting beyond the outside 

surface of the drawer side (14) is slightly smaller than the thickness of the fastening lug 
(24), a threaded bore (30) being provided in the front end of the mounting stud (28), into 

which the shaft of a fastening screw (31) is driven, which can be driven into the mounting 
stud (28) through a washer (33) disposed under its head into gripping contact of its head 

with the outside surface of the fastening lug (28), characterized in that the fastening lug 
(24), in its area between the longitudinal slot (26) and the drawer front (12), has an 

elongated groove (40) with a ramp (42) running parallel to the longitudinal slot (26) and, in 
a plane parallel to the bottom of the drawer, sloping from the bottom of the groove away  

 
from the drawer front (12), at which ramp (42) an elongate marginal area (38) of the 

washer (33), bent at a complementary angle, is supported. 
The hardware device of claim 1, characterized in that the horizontal distance (A), measured 
from the longitudinal central plane of the elongated slot (26) of the mounting lug (24) to 

the upper edge of the ramp surface (42) remote from the groove bottom, is slightly greater 
than the distance (a), measured from the central axis of the screw hole (44) in the washer 

(33) at its bottom to its bent elongate marginal edge area (38). 
The hardware device of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that a tapped hole (20) is provided in 
the area of the mounting lug (24) terminating the longitudinal slot (26) at the upper end and 

extends from the upper boundary surface to the elongated slot (26), which tapped hole (20) 
is engaged by the shaft, provided with a complementary head, of a height-adjusting screw 

(21), which is supported with its end facing the elongated slot at the mounting stud (28) of 
the stud member (18). 
The hardware device of one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the washer (33), with 
respect to its alignment with the stud (28), is held against rotation in the direction of its 

longitudinal central axis, but displaceably on the stud member (18) or drawer side (14).  
 
The hardware device of claim 4, characterized in that the washer (33) has a substantially 
rectangular or square shape to the one side of which the elongate, bent edge region (38) is 

fastened, and that at the side of the washer (33), which adjoins the edge region (38) at right 
angles and in the properly mounted position faces the lower open end of the slot (26), a 

guiding tongue (46) is provided, which protrudes towards the drawer side (14) and engages 
lengthwise displaceably an opening or recess in the drawer side (14) or stud member (18) 

reaching around it laterally. 
The hardware device of claim 5, characterized in that the guiding tongue (46) engages a 
longitudinal groove (48) created in the circumferential surface of the mounting stud (28). 
The hardware device of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the groove (40) ends open at its 
lower end in the lower boundary surface of the mounting lug (24). 
The hardware device of one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the mounting lug (24) 
protrudes from a mounting flange (22), in which at least one through opening is provided 

for a mounting screw that can be driven into the drawer front. 
The hardware device of claim 8, characterized in that the through opening(s) has/have the 
shape of an elongated hole (36) running horizontally.  

 
The hardware device of one of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the mounting stud (28) 
passes through a complementary opening (34) in the drawer side (14). 
The hardware device of claim 10, characterized in that the mounting member (18) has a 
flange (32) of enlarged diameter provided on the drawer-side end of the mounting stud 

(28). 
The hardware device of one of claims 1 to 11, characterized by a cap (50), which covers 
the hardware device (10) and can be put in place after the fastening connection between the 

mounting member and the stud (16; 18) has been produced.
