<ABSTRACT>
A compressor (1) comprises a rotor shaft (10) which is rotatable about a compressor axis (18) and is equipped with a multiplicity of moving blades (7) fastened to its periphery, a compressor casing (2) surrounding the rotor shaft (10) in the area of the moving blades (7), an inlet casing (9) enclosing the rotor shaft (10) on the inlet side of the compressor (1) and having an outer shell (3) and an inner shell (16), between which an inlet space (4) for the air to be compressed is formed, which inlet space (4) is connected on the one side to the ambient via an air inlet (5) provided with an inlet filter (6) and merges on the other side into a suction duct (27) equipped with adjustable inlet guide blades (8), the outer shell (3) adjoining the compressor casing (2), and a seal casing (11) at the end of the inner shell (16) facing the moving blades (7), which seal casing (11), bearing against the periphery of the rotor shaft (10), seals off the suction duct (27) from the ambient and contains a sealing-air chamber (12) from which sealing air can discharge into the annular gap (28) between seal casing (11) and rotor shaft (10). Such a compressor is improved in its operational reliability by the sealing chamber (12) being connected to the inlet space (4) via at least one sealing-air duct (15).

Compressor, in particular for gas turbines, 
including 


(a) a rotor shaft (10) which can be rotated about a 
compressor centre line (18) and which has a plurality 

of rotor blades (7) fastened at its periphery; 
(b) a compressor casing (2) surrounding the rotor 
shaft (10) in the region of the rotor blades (7); 
(c) an inlet casing (9) surrounding the rotor shaft 
(10) at the inlet end of the compressor (1) and 

having an outer shell (3) and an inner shell (16) 
between which is formed an inlet space (4) for the 

air to be compressed, which inlet space (4) is in 
connection with the surroundings at one end by 

means of an air inlet (5) provided with an inlet 
filter (6) and merges at the other end into an 

induction duct (27) equipped with adjustable or 
fixed inlet guide vanes (8), the outer shell (3) 

adjoining the compressor casing (2); and 
(d) a seal casing (11) on the end of the inner shell 
(16) facing towards the rotor blades (7), which 

seal casing, located at the periphery of the rotor 
shaft (10), seals the induction duct (27) against 

the surroundings and includes a sealing air 
chamber (12) from which sealing air can emerge 

into the annular gap (28) between the seal casing 
(11) and the rotor shaft (10); 
 
characterized in that
 
(e) the seal chamber (12) is in connection with the 

inlet space (4) by means of at least one sealing 
air passage (15). 
Compressor according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that 


(a) a plurality of sealing ribs (20) are arranged one 
behind the other in the direction of the compressor 

centre line (18) in the annular gap (28) 
between the seal casing (11) and the rotor shaft 

(10), which sealing ribs, starting from the rotor  
 

shaft, protrude into the annular gap (28) and 
define a radial clearance (5) by their distance 

from the opposite side; and 
(b) the sealing ribs (20) are subdivided into two 
groups (20a, b) and the sealing air flows out of 

the sealing air chamber (12) into the annular gap 
(28) through a sealing air opening (21) arranged 

between the two groups (20a, b). 
Compressor according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that 


(a) a plurality of sealing ribs (20) are arranged one 
behind the other in the direction of the compressor 

centre line (18) in the annular gap (28) 
between the seal casing (11) and the rotor shaft 

(10), which sealing ribs (20), starting 
alternately from the seal casing (11) and the 

rotor shaft (10), protrude into the annular gap 
(28) and define a radial clearance (5) by their 

distance from the opposite side; and 
(b) the sealing ribs (20) are subdivided into two 
groups (20a, b) and the sealing air flows out of 

the sealing air chamber (12) into the annular gap 
(28) through a sealing air opening (21) arranged 

between the two groups (20a, b). 
Compressor according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the group of sealing ribs (20b) arranged 

between the sealing air opening (21) and the 
surroundings has a plurality of sealing rib pairs. 
Compressor according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the at least one sealing air 

passage (15) extends within the inner shell (16) of the 
inlet casing (9) and in that the at least one sealing 

air passage (15) is in connection at one end with the 

inlet space (4) by means of a sealing air inlet (13) 
and has a closable connection for a separate compressed 

air conduit at its other end.
