<ABSTRACT>
The communications system according to the invention includes a sending station (1) equipped with a laser source (10) sending a beam of coherent light waves with basic frequency (Fo) modulated by a carrier frequency of the useful signal corresponding to the information to be transmitted, and a receiving station able to pick up this information from a beat signal formed by mixing the beam (F') originating from the sending station (1) and a beam of waves (Fi) originating from a local oscillator (23). The beam (F) sent by the sending station includes a reference subbeam (F1) of unmodulated waves with base frequency (Fo) forming a reference signal and a useful subbeam (F2) the waves of which are modulated on a carrier via an acoustooptical cell (12) in order to form a useful information signal; the receiving station (2) includes a non-linear crystal element (22) in which only the waves of the beam (Fp) form the local source (23) and the waves of the reference beam (F'2) create a sufficiently stable grating of refractive indices, the local oscillator being obtained by deflection of the waves of the beam (Fp) by this index grating before being mixed with the waves of the useful beam (F'2) in a detector (28) in order to form the beat signal. A processing suite (29) makes it possible, by modulation, to gain access to the information transported by the useful beam (F'2). Application to communication in free space, between two stations in relative movement.

Free-space communication system with heterodyne
detection, comprising an emitting station (1) equipped

with a source (S1; 10) which emits a beam (F) of
coherent light waves of base frequency (f
0
) modulated by
a carrier frequency (f
i
) of the useful signal
corresponding to the information to be transmitted, and

a receiving station (2) capable of receiving this
information from a beat signal formed in a detector

(28) by the mixing of the received beam (F'),
corresponding to the emitted beam (F), and of a beam of

waves (FL; Fl) coming from a local oscillator (S2; 23),
the system being characterized in that the beam (F)

emitted by the emitting station (1) includes
unmodulated waves of base frequency (f
0
) which form a
reference beam (F1), in that the receiving station (2)

includes a nonlinear-crystal element (22) in which the
waves of a pump beam (F
p
) emitted by the local source
(23) and the unmodulated waves of base frequency (f
0
)
coming from the emitting station (1) create, by

interference, a refractive index grating which thus
generates a local-oscillator beam (Fl), the waves of

the local-oscillator beam (Fl) being obtained by the
diffraction of the waves of the pump beam (F
p
) by this
index grating, the said waves of the local-oscillator

beam (Fl) being mixed with the waves of a useful beam
(F'2) corresponding to the emitted useful signal for

forming the beat signal (S). 
System according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the beam (F) emitted by the source (10) of the

emitting station (1) is spatially separated into two
sub-beams (F1, F2), one (F1) of these sub-beams forming

the reference signal and the other (F2) the useful beam
modulated at the carrier frequency (f
i
) by passing
through an acoustooptic cell (12) for transporting the

useful-information signal, and in that the beam (F) is
then recomposed so as to form a two-frequency (f
0
,
f
0
 + f
i
) beam transmitted into free space (EL).
System according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the useful signal of the beam (F) emitted by the

laser source (10) of the emitting station (1) is
periodically phase-modulated at the carrier frequency

(f
i
).
System according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that since the beam (F) is

transmitted into space (EL) with a frequency shift δf
d
,
the nonlinear crystal (22) of time constant τ and the

value f
i
 of the carrier frequency are chosen so that
only the interference grating obtained with the beam of

waves of base frequency (f
0
 + δf
d
) of the transmitted
beam (F') and the beam (F
p
) emitted by the local source
(23) of the receiving station (2) create a stable index

grating in the nonlinear medium (22).
System according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the frequency (f
p
) of the pump beam (F
p
) is
adjusted by an acoustooptic cell (24) controlled by a

feedback device (25) coupled to the detector (28) so
that its deviation δf from the base frequency f
0

satisfies the following relationships:

|δf
d
 - δf| ≤ 1/τ
|f
i
 + δf
d
 - δf| ≥ 1/τ
System according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the pump beam (F
p
) is diffracted by the index
grating created by the reference signal of frequency

f
0
 + δf
d
 of the received beam (F') and by the pump beam
(F
p
) in order to produce the local-oscillator beam (Fl)
of frequency (f
l
) equal to f
0
 + δf
d
, of the same 
frequency and the same wavefront as the reference

signal of the received beam (F') so that the beat
signal obtained by heterodyne mixing between the useful

beam (F'2) of the received beam (F') and the
local-oscillator beam (Fl) has as frequency the carrier

frequency f
i
.
