<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compounds which are 
particularly useful in radioimaging and radio-chemotherapy 
as it particularly relates to the treatment and location of 
malignant melanomas and other pigmenting disorders. Novel 
acyl derivatives of phenolic thioether amines and their use 
in compositions for blocking melanin synthesis in human or 
animal melanocyte cells is also described. More 
particularly, the compositions involving the novel 
derivatives are useful in treating pigmentation problems 
due to a variety of skin disorders, including skin cancer 
in the form of melanoma. Phenylthioalkylamines is a broad class of compounds 
having a variety of uses which include therapeutics. US-A-4,134,996 
and US-A-4,183,927 disclose certain phenylthioalkylamine 
compounds which are useful as platelet 
aggregation inhibitors. Other phenylthioalkylamine 
compounds described in WO-A-9116302 are useful as 
depigmenting agents in treating a variety of pigmentary 
diseases. Such diseases are often characterized in the 
elevated levels of the enzyme tyrosinase in melanocytes; 
i.e., human and animal cells which synthesize the pigment 
melanin. There are a variety of pigmentary diseases, such 
as melasma, melanoma, and moles. In particular, moles are 
susceptible to becoming melanoma after exposure to sunlight 
which precipitates increased synthesis of tyrosinase. Usually commercial forms of depigmenting compositions 
are based on the use of hydroquinone. However, the 
hydroquinone preparations are very unstable and cause skin 
irritation. Hydroquinone compositions can also cause 
permanent whitening of the skin if used for a prolonged  
 
period and at a high concentration. As to treatment of 
melanoma, this is presently attended to by surgical 
procedures, since any type of known non-surgical treatment 
of melanoma is unsatisfactory. Research work has been conducted in the field of 
phenolic and diphenolic compounds to serve as a basis for 
chemotherapeutic treatment of melanoma and skin 
depigmentation. In particular, 4-S-cysteinylphenol (4-S-CP) 
and 4-S-cysteaminylphenol (4-S-CAP) have been 
synthesized and evaluated for cytotoxicity to normal 
epidermal melanocytes to determine their effectiveness as 
depigmenting agents and antimelanoma agents. Miura et al, 
"Synthesis of Cysteinylphenol, Cysteaminylphenol, and 
Related Compounds, and In Vivo Evaluation of Antimelanoma 
Effect", Arch. Dermatol Res. (1987) 279:219-225, disclose 
the effect of 4-S-CAP and 4-S-CP in depigmentation of black 
hair follicles as
