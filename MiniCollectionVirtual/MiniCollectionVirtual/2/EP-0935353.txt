<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to mobile cellular communication systems in which
asymmetric access to a time division duplex (TDD) communication channel is provided.

The channel is divided (by TDD) into slots which are allocated to either uplink
communication or downlink communication by the base station in each cell. Timing of

slots, and thus of compulsory uplink and downlink slots, is do-ordinated across the cells
of a system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a multiple access protocol for a communication
system, and in particular to an asymmetric access protocol for a mobile cellular
communication system using time division duplexing (TDD).In mobile telecommunication systems, data is passed between a mobile
end-user device and a base station in an uplink slot, and vice versa in a downlink slot.
Similar half duplex communication protocols are used in other communication systems
e.g. a ground station to a satellite. In mobile cellular communication systems, an
outstanding problem has been that an asymmetry can occur in the ratio of uplink traffic
to downlink traffic. For example, using a mobile end user device to send data (e.g. fax
or email) can result in several megabytes to be sent on the uplink, whilst only a few
bytes are received on the downlink. Current cellular systems have been designed to
support asymmetric traffic ratios which are identical across all cells, which leads to an
inefficient use of the frequency spectrum. The guard time between slots is an overhead
which is always incurred by the system.EP766416 A describes a wireless multiple access communication
systems which dynamically allocates available frame slots to uplink and downlink. A
cancellation signal, corresponding to or otherwise representative of the interfering
signal, (from an interfering base station to an interfered-with base station) is used. In the
interfered-with base station, the cancellation signal is used to cancel or otherwise offset
the mixed interference produced in a received composite signal which includes both the
desired mobile station to base station (uplink) signal and the interfering signal. Hence it
requires interference cancellation technique (timing adjustment, amplitude adjustment,
etc), which results in extra hardware implementation complexity. In addition to uplink
and downlink, the base station - base station link needs to be maintained, hence the
involvement of a Base Station Control (BSC), which is higher level over BS. This
causes extra signalling traffic and the mobile terminals are especially vulnerable to
extra hardware complexity. EP766416 describes a system used purely for cancelling or 
reducing co-channel interference purposes by the means of slot allocation (between
downlink and uplink) in a frequency reuse cell (essentially non-adjacent cells system.EP 720 321 A1 describes a similar, TDMA only system. The system is
used in either non-cellular systems or cellular system with identical asymmetric pattern,
that is where the
