<ABSTRACT>
The dispenser comprises a first cylinder (11), a first hollow piston 
(2) disposed slidably in the first cylinder (11), a second cylinder 

(12) coaxial with the first cylinder (11) and forming a prolongation 
thereof of smaller diameter, the inner wall of the second cylinder 

(12) having an enlarged horizontal annular recess (13) at the jontion 
of the first and second cylinders, a second piston (3) disposed 

slidably in the second cylinder (12), a vertical stem (4) disposed 
slidably within the first piston (2) and engaging the second piston 

(3) and a spring (6) extending within the second cylinder (13) between 
its lower end and the lower end of the second piston (3).

 
The first piston (2) is provided with an enlargement (14) intermediate 

its ends defining an upper portion (27A) and a lower portion (27B). 
The upper portion (27A) extends slidably above and within the first 

cylinder (11) and the lower portion (27B) extends slidably within the 
first cylinder (11) and the second cylinder (12). The enlargement (14) 

peripherally engages and defines a first unbroken seal (S1) with the 
inner surface of the first cylinder (11). The second piston (3) 

peripherally engages and defines a second seal (S2) with the inner 
surface of the second cylinder (12), the second seal (S2) being 

unbroken except when the second piston (3) is aligned with and spaced 
from the annular recess (13).

 
The lower portion (27B) of the first piston (2) is provided with a

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to pharmaceutical type pump dispensers
and, more particularly, to pharmaceutical type pump dispensers
having improved characteristics.EP-A2-0 450 267 discloses a fluid pump dispenser for pharmaceutical
use wherein the fluid is discharged at a predetermined pressure and
wherein a predetermined dosage is delivered regardless of the method
of actuation. These dispensers have outlet ports through which the
fluid is discharged and have inlet ports through which the fluid to be
dispensed is fed into the dispensers from a container supplying the
fluid. To insure delivery of a predetermined dosage, the dispenser is
designed so that its exit port is held closed during actuation until a
predetermined point on the down stroke of the pump piston is reached.
At this point the outlet port is opened and the discharge of the
predetermined dosage is initiated. The dispensers disclosed in the
above identified patent application employ an additional spring, other
than the conventional return spring, which is used to hold the outlet
port closed during part of the actuation. In these dispensers the
closure of the exit port occurs at the bottom end of the pump piston.EU-A1-0 499 073 discloses a fluid pump dispenser for pharmaceutical
use, having a structure similar to that of the EU-A2-0 450 267, but in
which the closure of the exit port occurs at the top end of the pump
piston, so that any fluid remaining in the path after the discharge
port is closed is sealed in the pump and not exposed to the
atmosphere. GB-A-2 023 225 discloses a finger actuated pump dispenser of the type
having a first upper hollow cylinder with a first diameter and open
upper and lower ends; a first vertical hollow piston having open top
and bottom ends and disposed slidably in the first upper hollow
cylinder; a second lower hollow cylinder coaxial with the first
cylinder and forming a prolongation thereof of smaller diameter, the
inner wall of the second cylinder having an enlarged horizontal
annular recess at the junction of the first and second cylinders; a
second vertical piston disposed slidably in the second cylinder, a
vertical stem disposed slidably within the first piston and engaging
the second piston, a spring extending within the second cylinder
between its lower end and the lower end of the second piston, the
first piston peripherally engaging and defining a first unbroken seal
with the inner surface of the first cylinder, the second piston
peripherally engaging and defining a second seal with the inner
sur
