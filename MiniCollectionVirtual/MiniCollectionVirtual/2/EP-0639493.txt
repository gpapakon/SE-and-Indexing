<ABSTRACT>
An agricultural tractor is provided comprising a base frame 
(2) and an operator's cab (6) , mounted on the base frame (2) , 

and including a wall having a passage (18) which is normally 
sealed with a removable window panel (12). The panel (12) 

basically has a rectangular shape, except for a triangular 
cut-out (14) in one of its corners. In one position of the panel 

(12), the cut-out (14) is blanked-of f whereas in another 
position the cut-out (14) is uncovered so as to form an aperture 

(32) for accommodating the passage of a control cable for the 
remote operation of external equipment through the cab wall.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to wired remote control of
equipment and/or implements carried by or towed behind a vehicle
as defined in the preamble of claim 1 (see FR-A-2695899),
and more particularly to an access feature for introducing a
control cable into the operator's cab. The invention has been
conceived in relation to an agricultural tractor but it is to be
understood that the invention is applicable to any vehicle or
even static arrangement having a cab or enclosure and requiring
the use of remote control cables.In the following description right hand and left hand
references are determined by standing at the rear of the tractor
facing in a direction of forward travel. Also, in the following
description, it is to be understood that terms such as "forward",
"rearward", "upward", etc., are words of convenience and are not
to be construed as limiting terms.Nowadays, external equipment carried by an agricultural
tractor or agricultural implements, such as balers or pull-type
forage harvesters, hitched by a tractor, commonly comprise
components which have to be remotely controlled by means of a
control box installed on the tractor's operator station.
Especially with tractors provided with cabs enclosing the
operator station, some difficulties are experienced to pass the
control cable, leading from the control box to the remotely
controlled implement or equipment, through the cab structure.In this connection, it is a common practice to provide the
rear wall of the cab with an aperture, of small dimensions, such
as shown in FR-A-2.415.035, to allow the control cable to enter
the cab therethrough. When no control cables are employed, the
aperture commonly is sealed with a removable panel member.
However, in as much as control boxes normally are relatively
large, it is impossible to pass them through the small aperture
in the cab structure and therefore, each time a control box is
installed or removed from the operator's station, the connecting 
cables have to be disconnected from the box, which is a
cumbersome and time-consuming operation, if at all possible,
since some types of control boxes are not fitted with a breakable
form of connection.Of course, to overcome the above disadvantage, it is
possible to provide an access passage of larger dimensions,
through which any control box of standardised dimensions freely
could be entered into the cab without difficulty. It will be
appreciated however that, with such an arrangement and due to the
fact that the passage should remain open during the operation
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A movable or static arrangement (1) comprising an
operator's station (8) surrounded by an enclosure or cab (6)

and including at least one wall having a passage (18)
therethrough defined by a mount (16), a removable cab panel

(12) supported on said mount (16) to cover said passage (18)
when positioned in a closed condition in a first orientation

and an aperture (32) wherethrough a control cable for the
remote operation of external equipment means may enter said

enclosure or cab (6), and

   characterized in that said aperture (32) is a part
of said passage (18) and is defined inbetween said panel

(12) and said mount (16) by positioning said panel in said
closed condition in a second orientation.
An arrangement according to claim 1 characterized
in that said arrangement is a vehicle (1) comprising a

movable base frame (2) on which the operator's cab (6) is
mounted.
An arrangement according to claims 1 or 2
characterized in that said arrangement is an agricultural

tractor (1) and said external equipment is an implement
carried by or towed behind said tractor (1).
An arrangement according to claims 1 to 3
characterized in that the removable cab panel (12) has an

irregularity (14) in an otherwise mainly regular shape. 
An arrangement according to claim 4 characterized
in that the shape of the mount (16) corresponds to the shape

of said panel (12).
An arrangement according to claim 5 characterized
in that the passage (18) has a mainly rectangular shape

comprising a triangular gusset (20) at one corner thereof.
An arrangement according to any of the preceding
claims characterized in that the removable panel (12) has a

mainly rectangular shape comprising a triangular cut-out
(14).
An arrangement according to claim 7 when appended
to claim 6 characterized in that, in said first orientation

of the panel (12), when in the closed condition, the cut-out
(14) is blanked-off by the gusset (20), such that the

passage (18) is completely sealed by the panel (12), and, in
said second orientation of the panel (12), the cut-out (14)

and gusset (20) are shifted relative to each other whereby
said aperture (32) is created.
An arrangement according to claim 8 characterized
in that movement of the panel (12) from said first

orientation to said second orientation is accomplished by
turning said panel (12) through an angle of approximately

180° around a central axis (30) oriented perpendicularly to
the surface of said panel (12).
An arrangement according to any of the preceding
claims characterized in that said removable cab panel (12) 

is formed by a transparent window panel having weather strip
means (22) for being tightly-fitted against the mount (16).
A method for guiding a control cable for the
remote operation of external equipment means through a wall

of a cab (6) enclosing an operator's station (8); said wall
having a passage (18) therethrough defined by a mount (16)

and a removable cab panel (12) supported on said mount (16)
to cover said passage (18) when positioned in a closed

condition having a first orientation; and

   characterized in that said method comprises the
steps of :


removing said removable cab panel (12) from said
mount (16) to open said passage (18);
introducing said control cable into the cab (6)
through said passage (18);
changing the orientation of said removable cab
panel (12) towards a second orientation; and
re-installing said cab panel (12) into said wall
in said closed condition having said second orientation to

thereby define an aperture (32) inbetween said panel (12)
and said mount (16).
A method according to claim 11 characterized in
that the changing step includes the step of turning said cab

panel (12) through an angle of approximately 180° around a
central axis (30) oriented perpendicularly to the surface of

said panel (12).
A method according to claims 11 or 12,
characterized in that the introducing step further includes

the step of passing a control box connected to said control
cable through the passage (18) in said cab wall. 
A method according to any of the claims 11 to 13
wherein said removable cab panel (12) has a basically

rectangular shape comprising a cut-out (14) and
characterized in that the method further includes the steps

of:

associating the cut-out in the cab panel (12)

panel (12) is arranged in said first orientation to thereby
seal the passage (18) completely; and
