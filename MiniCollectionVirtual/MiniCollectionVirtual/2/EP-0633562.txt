unit including a signal transmission element. The transmission 

element transmits by wireless, i.e., through noncontact 
transmission, a control signal for driving an electromechanical 

transducing element fixed to a rotary magnetic head. 
Therefore, noises are prevented from appearing on a display, 

and stable compensation in the deviation of the magnetic 
head and a high reliability of the magnetic head unit can be 

attained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a movable magnetic
head unit such as a magnetic recording/reproducing device
with a recording and reproducing function that has means for
transmitting a control signal for driving a movable magnetic
head.FIG. 1 is a partial cutaway vertical sectional view of
a rotary drum including an electromagnetically driven type
actuator used in a conventional magnetic recording/reproducing
device. As shown in FIG. 1, an electromagnetically
driven type actuator 21A is fixed to an upper drum 5 with a
screw 9, and is rotatable around a rotation axis 3. The
rotation axis 3 is supported by bearings 4 fixed to a lower
drum 2. A magnetic tape 1, that is, a magnetic recording
medium, is obliquely slided along a tape guide (not shown)
on the outer surfaces of the upper drum 5 and the lower
drum 2.A magnetic head 6 for recording and reproducing an
image signal is adhered to the top of a movable plate disposed 
on the actuator 21A. The magnetic head 6 can be moved
in the direction along the rotation axis 3 in accordance
with a control signal. Such a control signal is produced so
as to make optimal a signal reproduced at the magnetic
head 6, and is transmitted to a slip-ring 8 via a brush 7
to be supplied to the actuator 21A.In FIG. 1, reference numerals 33 and 34 denote a lower
transformer and an upper transformer in a rotary transformer,
respectively. The upper transformer 34 is fixed to the
upper drum 5 so as to be rotatable around the rotation
axis 3. On a surface of the upper transformer 34 opposing
the lower transformer 33, a plurality of grooves are formed
concentrically with the rotation axis 3, and a coil is
provided in each of these grooves. The lower transformer 33
is fixed to the lower drum 2. On a surface of the lower
transformer 33 opposing the upper transformer 34, a plurality
of grooves are also formed concentrically with the rotation
axis 3, and a coil is provided in each of these
grooves.A signal to be recorded on the magnetic tape 1 is sent
from the coils in the grooves of the lower transformer 33 to
the coils in the grooves of the upper transformer 34 to be
supplied to the magnetic head 6. In the reproducing operation,
the magnetic head 6 reads a recorded signal from the
magnetic tape 1, and the read signal is transmitted by the 
route reverse of that in the recording operation.Further, the rotary drum has another similar
actuator 21B on the other side of the rotation axis 3 so as
to oppose the actuator 21A. These two actuators are controlled
as follows:FIG. 2 is a block
