<ABSTRACT>
A skid ring (1) for a pipe which is to be fitted, under the ground, in a casing pipe, for example for a gas pipe or sewer pipe, comprises a multiplicity of coinciding segments (10). Each segment (10) exhibits, to one side, a radial portion in the form of straps (12) which engage into correspondingly configured radial portions (17) of an adjacent segment (10). The straps (12) are provided with obliquely running grooves (13) which interact with matching grooves of a wedge in the manner of an unscrewed bolt/nut connection, the two adjacent segments (10) being moved towards one another by axially driving the wedge into a guide groove (20). The entire skid ring (1) is made of non-metallic materials, with the result that no signs of corrosion can occur. Moreover, the segments (10) can, within wide limits, be adapted to various pipe diameters by yielding elastically, with the result that the number of individual parts to be supplied is extremely small. The skid rings (1) can also be easily pre-assembled and reliably braced on the pipe.

Skid ring for an underground pipe, for example in the form of a gas pipe or 
water pipe, to be introduced into a casing pipe, which skid ring comprises at least two 

segments which are joined together by means of clamping elements and are held pressed 
in a force-locked manner against the pipe under pretension and support outwardly 

directed skids, the skid ring (1) being made up of a plurality of congruent segments (10), 
and each segment (10) being provided in each case on one side with a circumferential 

section in the form of one or more tongues (12) and - matched thereto - a further 
circumferential section on the opposite side in the form of a closure part (17) having one 

or more insertion openings (18), in which insertion openings (18) the tongues (12) of 
an adjacent segment (10) are engaged,
 
characterized in that 


the tongues (12) have a multiplicity of parallel and equidistantly disposed 
grooves (13) which are aligned to extend with an inclination of a few angular 

degrees with respect to the axial direction, and the closure part (17) has, in the 
engagement region of the tongues (12), an axially aligned guide groove (20) for 

a tongue-shaped wedge (30, 40) inserted therein, 
the wedge (30, 40) has grooves (33,43) which are aligned so as to match the 
grooves (13) of the tongues (12) and are engaged with the latter, and 
the wedge (30, 40) is driven axially into the guide groove (20) to such an extent 
that the two adjacent segments (10) are clamped together and, consequently, the 

skid ring (1) is held pressed against the pipe. 
Skid ring according to Claim 1, characterized in that, for the purpose of 
preliminary fixation of two adjacent segments (10), at least one of the tongues (12) has,  

 
on the side remote from the grooves (13), notches (14) which interact with latching 

blocks (19) on the closure part (17). 
Skid ring according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that a removable stop 
stirrup (50) can be detachably mounted as an insert stop in the region of the closure part 

(17) for the preliminary assembly. 
Skid ring according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 
wedges (30, 40) are provided laterally with a sawtooth-like retaining notch structure (31, 

41) and the guide groove (20) is provided with a mating notch structure (21).
