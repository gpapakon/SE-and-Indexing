<ABSTRACT>
Device for locking a filter holder on an infusion head (1) of a coffee machine equipped with a locking ramp (2) and designed to take the filter holder (3), which for this purpose has means (4) for fixing it to said head (1), in such a way that said filter holder (3) can be engaged in the head (1) and rotated from a free position to a locked position. According to the invention the locking device comprises means for indicating that the filter holder (3) has moved from the free position to the locked position. The invention applies to espresso-type coffee machines.

<CLAIMS>
Device for locking a filter holder on the infusion head 
(1) of a cafetiere of the espresso type equipped with a 

locking slope (2) and adapted for sealingly receiving the 
filter holder (3) which for this purpose includes means (4) of 

fixing to the said head (1), so that the said filter holder 
(3) can be engaged in the head and be brought, by a rotation 

movement, from a free position to a locked position, 
characterised in that it comprises indication means for 

indicating, when the filter holder (3) moves from its free 
position to its locked position, the precise moment when the 

filter holder (3) reaches its locked position so as to obtain 
correct locking thereof. 
Locking device according to Claim 1, characterised in that 

the indication means are audible. 
Locking device according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
the audible indication means include a flexible blade (9) and 

a projection (10) cooperating with the said blade (9) so as to 
flex the blade (9) and release it abruptly when the filter 

holder (3) reaches the locked position. 
Locking device according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
the flexible blade (9) is fixed to the filter holder (3) and 

the protrusion (10) is formed in the infusion head (1).

operation of an electroacoustic device (16, 17). 
Locking device according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the indication means are visual. 
Locking device according to Claim 8, characterised in that 
the indication means include a switch (15) cooperating with 

the filter holder (3) and adapted for controlling the 
operation of an optoelectronic display device (16, 18). 
Locking device according to Claim 9, characterised in 
that the optoelectronic device includes a light emitting diode 

(18).
