<ABSTRACT>
Power steering system comprising a rack (9a) piston (8) driven in translation by the rotation of an input shaft (3) and by a difference in hydraulic pressure between chambers (7a, 7b) which it delimits, the rack intermeshing with a toothed segment (10a) driving an output shaft (4). Two racks and two corresponding toothed arcs are provided, their intermeshing occurring in a plane passing through the input shaft's axis (2), and the piston (8) being partially movable in relation to the input shaft (3), with a sleeve (11) linking one to the other.

Hydraulic assistance device, which can especially 
be used as power-assisted steering for a motor vehicle, 

and suitable for converting an input rotational movement 
into an output rotational movement, this device 

comprising at least: 

a casing (1) at least one part of which forms a 
cylinder of revolution (1a) about a main axis 

(2); 
an input shaft (3) housed in the casing along the 
direction of this main axis, translationally 

fixed along this direction, and rotationally 
driven about this main axis by the input rotational 

movement; 
an output shaft (4) not coplanar with the input 
shaft and whose direction is substantially 

perpendicular to that of the latter; 
a rotary hydraulic directional control valve (6) 
capable of being actuated by rotation of the 

input shaft so as to give rise to a pressure 
difference between first and second chambers (7a, 

7b) defined in the said cylinder; 
a piston (8) housed in the casing in order to 
slide axially therein, at least partially under 

the effect of the said pressure difference, this 
piston being substantially coaxial with the input 

shaft (3), at least partially surrounding the 
latter, and having, on the one hand, a sealing 

section (8a) separating the two chambers in a 
sealed fashion and, on the other hand, a transmission 

section (8b) endowed with a rack (9a) 
meshing with a toothed sector (10a) rotationally 

linked to the output shaft, and; 
a movement converter (11 to 14) arranged between 
the input shaft (3) and the piston (8) so as to 

convert a rotational movement of the first into 
a translational movement of the second, 
  
 

characterized in that the transmission section (8b) of 
the piston has, seen in the direction of the said main 

axis, a profile with two branches in the shape of a U 
whose branches both form racks (9a, 9b) and mesh, at 

respective geometric sites, which are substantially 
coplanar with one another and with the said main axis, 

with respective toothed sectors (10a, 10b) which are 
integral with one another and with the output shaft (4). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the movement converter (11 to 14) comprises, on the 

one hand, an essentially cylindrical sleeve (11), housed 
with clearance inside the U-shaped profile formed by the 

piston (8), and having, on its internal surface, a 
helical track for balls (11a), and, on the other hand, 

means (8c, 8d, 8e, 11b, 11c, 11d, 12, 13, 13b) for fixing 
the sleeve to the piston, suitable for preventing practically 

any relative rotation of the piston and of the 
sleeve about the said main axis (2), and any relative 

translation other than relative translations along 
directions perpendicular to the said main axis. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the said fastening means comprise: 


a radial widening (11b) of the sleeve; 
axial stops (8c, 8d) formed by the piston and 
arranged facing the radial widening of the 

sleeve; 
two studs (11c, 11d) projecting diametrically 
from the radial widening; 
two non-plane elastic rings (12, 13) together 
forming two housings inside which the two studs 

are respectively inserted and can slide along 
their common direction (D) without freedom of 

rotation about the said main axis; 
at least one radial extension (12c, 13c) of each 
ring, arranged at 90Â°, for an angular reference 

frame centered on this ring, with respect to each 
housing (12a, 13a) partially formed by this ring; 

and  
 
at least two grooves (8e) provided in the piston, 
each radial extension of each ring being intended 

to be received in one of these grooves and being 
housed therein so as to slide along its radial 

direction (15), and in abutment against it along 
a direction tangential to this ring. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the input shaft (3) passes, in a sealed fashion, 

through the sealing section of the piston, and in that 
the axial stops formed by the piston are situated in this 

sealing section. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that it comprises elastic thrust means (16 to 27) bearing 

on the casing so as to apply, on a contact surface (8f) 
of the transmission section (8b) of the piston on the 

side opposite the racks, an elastic force directed 
towards the said toothed sectors. 
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the said elastic thrust means comprise at least one 

roller (16, 21, 22) mounted rotatably about at least a 
first rotation pin (17, 23) substantially parallel to the 

direction of the output shaft, this roller rolling over 
the said contact surface whilst being elastically forced 

towards it. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the first rotation pin of the roller is linked to a 

second rotation pin (18), substantially parallel to the 
first, eccentric with respect to it, and elastically 

forced in rotation with respect to the casing (1) in a 
direction suitable for bringing the first rotation pin 

close to the said contact surface. 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the second rotation pin (18) is forced by a spring 

with annular profile (19, 20) having two ends (19a, 19b; 
20a, 20b) adopting, along this annular profile, relative 

angular positions from which they can move away elastically, 

a first (19a, 20a) of these two ends being fixed to 
the casing (1) and the second (19b, 20b) being  

 
rotationally linked to the second rotation pin (18). 
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the spring with annular profile is an open ring with 

a single coil (20) and with elastic opening. 
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the said elastic thrust means comprise at least one 

roller (21, 22) having a rotation and translation pin 
(23) substantially parallel to the direction of the 

output shaft, this roller being elastically forced, by a 
force directed along this rotation and translation pin, 

against at least one part (8g) of the contact surface 
which is oriented parallel to the main axis and obliquely 

with respect to the said rotation and translation pin.
