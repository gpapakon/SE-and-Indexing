<ABSTRACT>
A Cartesian amplifier is provided with a means of 
controlling its output power comprising a controllable 

attenuator (20) in the amplifier forward path (4) and a 
controllable amplifier (21) in the feedback path (11). A 

control signal representing the required power level is 
applied to the attenuator (20) and controllable 

amplifier (21) and, in response thereto, the degrees of 
attenuation and amplification are varied in inverse 

proportion to one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a technique for 
controlling the power output of an amplifier, in particular 
that of a Cartesian amplifier without causing distortion to 
the wanted signals i.e. the signals being amplified. The 
power control is applied by varying the forward and reverse 
path gains of the Cartesian loop. A description of the operation of a linearised 
amplifier based on the Cartesian loop is given in our 
British Patent Application No 9315985.3 entitled "Automatic 
Calibration of the Quadrature Balance within a Cartesian 
Amplifier". This shows how the loop uses modulation 
feedback to reduce the unwanted intermodulation products in 
the RF output. Power control can provide significant advantage in 
a mobile radio environment (to which Cartesian amplifiers 
have found application). By reducing the transmit power to 
the minimum for good communications, co-channel and adjacent 
channel interference can be reduced and battery life in hand 
portable equipment can be extended. Thus a method that 
allows efficient power control for a Cartesian amplifier 
without interfering with the wanted signal or the 
performance of the loop is highly desirable. Conventional power control can be applied in two 
ways. Firstly, a power attenuator can be used on the output 
of the amplifier, but this is wasteful of both power and 
hardware. Secondly, direct control of the amplifier output 
can be used by, for instance, controlling the supply voltage 
fed to it or by controlling any bias current. Controlling 
the amplifier output is of little use in the case of a 
Cartesian amplifier as the loop will always compensate for a 
reduction in amplifier gain by increasing the drive level. 
This would result in the amplifier being overdriven, causing 
a significant increase in distortion.  In the case of a linear amplifier, such as results 
from the application of a Cartesian loop, power control can 
be applied by reducing the drive level at the input to the 
amplifier system. This requires that the dynamic range of 
the modulating signal be extended to include the power 
control range. A number of factors limit the dynamic range 
of a Cartesian loop; noise and pick-up effects and, more 
importantly, the unwanted carrier output from the amplifier. 
This second effect is due to DC offsets in the baseband 
circuitry within the loop. Any offsets appearing at the 
output of the differential amplifier will result in carrier 
appearing at RF. Because the carrier is in the centre of 
the RF output frequency spectrum, it
