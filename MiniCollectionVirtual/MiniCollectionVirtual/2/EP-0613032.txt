<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fiber optic
coupling devices, and more particularly to coupling
devices for optically coupling a fiber optic cable and
an opto-electronic device.Fiber optic transmission lines, also referred to as
fiber optic cables, are finding ever increasing uses for
transmission of telecommunication and data signals,
which are typically analog and digital in nature,
respectively. The use of such fiber optic transmission
lines has several advantages over conventional
electrical cables. For example, fiber optic materials
frequently possess a cost advantage over electric
cables. Furthermore, the power required to drive optic
signals is frequently less than that required for many
electrical cables. It may also be noted that optical
transmission of data provides an enhanced rate of
information transfer over longer distances.In typical applications, fiber optic connectors
require a coupling device which effectively optically
couples the fiber optic transmission line with an opto-electronic
device (OED). The OED is further
electronically coupled by two or more lead wires to
electronic circuits which operate in conjunction with
the OED. In a large number of important applications,
such electronic circuits, including integrated circuits,
are mounted on a printed circuit board or ceramic
substrate. Furthermore, electronic equipment such as
computers, diagnostic devices, analytical equipment and
the like frequently utilize two or more printed circuit
boards stacked in a high density, parallel fashion in
order to satisfy the continuing need for electronic
equipment of reduced size. To accommodate the use of
optical transmission devices in such densely packed
parallel arrangements of circuit boards, it is commonly
required that the fiber optic cable enter the printed 
circuit board along a path substantially parallel to the
board with which it will interface.In order to accommodate the need for a parallel
arrangement between the fiber optic cable and the
associated printed circuit board, heretofore used
connectors have utilized a packaging arrangement in
which the OED is mounted in a tubular housing adapted to
coaxially mate with the ferrule of the fiber optic
cable. Such tubular housings are commonly mounted to a
casing which is in turn mounted to the printed circuit
board containing the associated electronic circuits.Conventional fiber optic connectors are disclosed
in the following U.S. Patents: 4,186,995; 4,222,629;
4,273,413; 4,307,934; and 4,911,519.Optical connectors of the type disclosed
