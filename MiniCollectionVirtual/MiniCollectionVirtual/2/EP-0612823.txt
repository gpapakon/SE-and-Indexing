<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adhesive sheet 
having an excellent adhesive strength which can be 
easily peeled from the adhered material by heat treatment at 
any time. An adhesive sheet comprising a pressure-sensitive 
adhesive layer which contains a foaming agent, having 
formed thereon a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer which does 
not contain a foaming agent is known as disclosed in, for 
example, JP-A-63-186791 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means 
an "unexamined published Japanese patent application"). A conventional adhesive 
sheet prepared by simply forming a foaming agent-containing 
pressure-sensitive adhesive layer on a substrate does not show 
sufficient adhesive strength to a material to which 
the adhesive sheet is adhered due to the decreased adhesive 
force caused by the foaming agent [see, JP-B-50-13878, 
JP-B-51-24534 (the term "JP-B" as used herein means an 
"examined published Japanese patent application"), JP-A-56-61468, 
JP-A-56-61469, JP-A-60-252681]. Formation of the pressure-sensitive adhesive 
layer which does not contain a foaming agent can achieve the 
increase of the adhesive strength to a material to be adhered.  
 
However, when the foaming agent is foamed or 
the adhesive sheet is subjected to an expanding treatment by 
heat, it sometimes occurs that the decrease of the adhesive 
strength caused by the reduction of the adhered area is insufficient 
and a satisfactory peeling effect cannot be achieved. An object of the present invention is to provide an 
adhesive sheet having both excellent adhesive strength to 
a material to be adhered and excellent decrease of 
the adhesive strength after heat treatment. The adhesive sheet according to the present invention 
comprises a substrate having formed on one surface or both 
surfaces thereof a rubber-like elastic layer, a heat-expandable 
layer, and an adhesive layer in this order from the substrate. 
Figure 1 is an enlarged cross sectional view showing an 
example of the adhesive sheet of the present invention,  Figure 2 is an enlarged cross sectional view showing 
another example of the adhesive sheet of the present invention,  Figure 3 is a photograph showing a partial cross 
section of the adhesive sheet of Example 1 after heating; and  Figure 4 is a photograph showing a partial cross 
section of an adhesive sheet of the comparative example after 
heating. The present invention is described in detail below. Due to the claimed structure in which the heat-expandable layer 
and the adhesive layer are separated in the
