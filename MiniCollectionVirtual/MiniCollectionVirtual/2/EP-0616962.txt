<ABSTRACT>
The method and the device for detection apply to a depiler (1), enabling the running of the latter to be further automated. When a pallet (11), laden with a pile of objects (22) arranged in layers (20) and in rows (21), is introduced into the depiler, it is necessary to determine which is the first row that the gripping device (4) will have to grip and transfer, particularly in the case where the upper layer is possibly incomplete. To this end, the depiler is equipped with a feeler means (42, 44, 45) which feels the upper layer in order to determine which is the first row present on the layer. The feeler cycle is conducted so that all the rows present in the upper layer are detected, then commanding the taking of the first row present detected. Owing to their particular configuration, the feeler means (42) may also detect the horizontality and flatness of the row to be gripped.

Method of detecting the number of rows (21) of 
objects (22) present in a top layer (20) of a pile (2) of 

objects disposed in a plurality of rows in at least one 
layer, the method comprising the following steps:
 
   a feeling cycle is initiated which actuates the displacement 

along a horizontal axis (X) of feeling means (4) 
comprising at least one feeler (42, 44, 45) able to detect 

the presence or the absence of at least one row of objects, 
above the said first row or rows to be sensed,
 
   then raise the said pile along the vertical axis (Z) 

of the said pile to a position where at least one feeler 
detects the presence of a row, the raising of the pile 

being then stopped,
 
   then, in the case where the feeler or feelers detect 

the presence of the row or rows which they overhang, move 
the said feeling means and the top layer away from each 

other along a vertical axis (Z), then displace the said 
feeling means along the horizontal axis (X) to convey them 

above the row or rows neighbouring the row or rows whose 
presence has already been detected,
 
   then bring once again the said feeler or feelers and 

the upper layer closer together along the vertical axis (Z) 
in order to detect the presence or the absence of the row 

or rows which they overhang,
 
   the feeling cycle being continued until at maximum the 

plurality of rows present in the upper layer has been detected 
and being discontinued when at least one feeler 

detects the absence of a row, or respectively detects the 
first row present in the layer. 
Method of detection according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the movements of the pile closer to and  

 
further away from the feeling means along the vertical axis 

(Z) are effected by raising and lowering the pile. 
Method of detection according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the movements of the pile closer to and 

further away from the feeling means along the vertical axis 
(Z) are effected by raising and lowering the feeling means. 
Method of detection according to one of the claims 
2 or 3, characterized in that at the start of the feeling 

cycle, at least one feeler (42, 44, 45) is brought above 
the position of the row corresponding to the row disposed 

hindmost in the top layer. 
Method of detection according to one of the claims 
2 or 3, characterized in that at the start of the feeling 

cycle, at least one feeler (42, 44, 45) is brought above 
the position of the row corresponding to the row disposed 

foremost with respect to the top layer. 
Method of detection according to one of the claims 
2 to 5, characterized in that a stopping of the cycle is 

commanded when an error of surface evenness or of horizontality 
of the first row detected exceeds a reference value. 
Depalletizing method characterized in that it comprises 
a feeling cycle such as mentioned in the claims 2 to 

6, followed by a cycle of grasping the said first row detected. 
Depalletizing method according to claim 7, characterized 
in that the feeling cycle is initiated only after a 

loading of a new pallet (11) or a stopping of the production 
machine (10), and that, as soon as a final row has 

been detected, its ordinal number in the layer is recorded 
in a control program, said row and the rows following being 

grasped sequentially. 
Depalletizing method according to claim 8, characterized 
in that the feeling cycle is initiated for the 

grasping of each row.  
 
Apparatus for detecting the number of horizontal 
rows (21) of objects (22) in the top layer (21) 〈sic. 20〉 

of a pile (2) of objects disposed in a plurality of rows on 
at least one layer for applying the method of detection 

according to one of the claims 1 to 6 and of the depalletizing 
method according to one of the claims 7 to 9,
 
   characterized in that it comprises
 
   means of support (31, 32) able to be displaced at 

least along a horizontal axis (X) perpendicular to the axis 
(Y) of the one of the said rows,
 
   feeling means attached to said support,
 
   means allowing the feeling means and the said top 

layer to be moved closer to each other or further away 
along the vertical axis (Z),
 
   the said feeling means being made up of
 
   at least one feeler (42, 44, 45) disposed so as to be 

able to detect the presence or the absence of at least one 
row of objects,
 
   and control means (5) able to control the feeling 

cycle. 
Apparatus according to claim 10, characterized in

at least one front feeler (44), one middle feeler 

(42) and one rear feeler (45) disposed in such a way as to 
overhang three consecutive
 rows of objects. 
Apparatus according to claim 10, characterized in 
that the middle feeler or feelers (42) comprise at least
