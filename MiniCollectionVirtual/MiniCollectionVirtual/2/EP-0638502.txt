<ABSTRACT>
For removing stacks of paper from a transport track via an exit (9), a carriage (21) is provided, with which the exit (9), which directly adjoins a packaging device (41), can be opened and closed in an essentially gap-free manner. For this purpose, the carriage (21) has a closure plate for closing the exit (9), which serves simultaneously as a supporting element (20) for the essentially rigid support of the stack of paper in the region of the extended carriage (21). As a result, the associated transporter (2) can have a relatively low number of transport belts (15).

sliding surface for the conveying movement.
Means according to claim 1, characterized in that the support members
(19, 20) are associated with a conveying portion (7, 8) at least in the

in a substantially dimensionally stiff manner spaced from the ends (11, 12)
of the conveying portions (7, 8), that in particular the portion (7) in at

least one position overlaps the residual portion (8) in at least one
direction roughly parallel to the conveying plane (10) and that preferably

the portion (7) is displaceable with respect to the residual portion (8)
roughly parallel to the conveying plane (10).
Means according to claim 1, characterized in that at least one support
member (20) of the portion (7) in the retracted or extended position

transversely to the conveying plane (10) is in the vicinity of at least one
substantially dimensionally stiff support member (19) of the residual 

portion (8), that in particular a support member (19, 20) of at least one
conveying portion (7, 8) is in a substantially uniform distribution in its

longitudinal or width direction and that preferably a support member (19,

20) is arranged in fixed, positionally rigid manner with respect to the
conveying movement.
Means according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that a support member (20) of the portion (7) in the extended position

engages with a marginal region (27) below a support member (19) of the
residual portion (8), characterized in that in particular the portion (7)

with the corresponding support member (20)
is movably mounted with respect to the residual portion (8) roughly

parallel to the conveying direction (5) and that preferably the rear end
(27) of the support member (20) of the extended portion (7), in a view of

the conveying plane (10), forms a substantially uninterrupted extension of
the support member (19) of the residual portion (8) and/or the support

member (20) of the retracted portion (7) is largely approximately congruent
to the support member (19) of the residual portion (8).
Means according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the support member (19) of one conveying portion (8) is wider than the

support member (20) of the other conveying portion (7), that in particular
the support member (19) of one conveying portion (8) laterally engages

round on at least one side the support member (20) of the other conveying
portion (7) and that preferably the support member (19) of a conveying

portion (8), in a view of the conveying plane (10), forms a U-shaped or
forwardly open receptacle for the support member (20) of the other conveying

portion (7).
Means according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that a support member (19) of the residual portion (8) engages over an

extended support member (20) of the portion (7) with at least one leg (37)
positioned laterally outside the conveying width (18) over only part of the

length of the extended support member (20), that in particular the support
member (19) of one conveying portion (8) engages round the support member

(20) of the other conveying portion (7) roughly parallel to the conveying
direction (5) and that preferably a support member (20) of the extended 

portion (7) forms a shield or cover for a discharge outlet (9) for the
sheet layers freed with the portion (7) retracted.
Means according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the support member (19, 20) of at least one conveying portion (8, 7)

is formed by a thin sheet metal plate or the like, that the support members (19, 20)
in the extended position are substantially located in one plane and transversely

to the conveying plane (10) are reciprocally displaced at the most
by roughly the thickness of one plate and that preferably one edge (28, 27)

of at least one support member (19, 20), in cross-section to its back, is
substantially inclined to the conveying plane (10).
Means according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that at least one support member (19, 20) is provided as a support for at

least one conveying runner (15), such as a conveyor belt, that in particular
the conveying runner (15) is provided with parallel sides for support

on the support member (19, 20) and for the reception of the sheet layers
and that preferably a conveying runner (15) runs continuously over at least

both conveying portions (7, 8) and/or over a reversing means (16) forming
the front end of the portion (7) or which is forwards free and at least

Means according to claim 8, characterized in that transversely to the
conveying direction are spacedly juxtaposed several conveying runners

(15), that in particular at least one connecting conveyor (3, 4) connected
to the conveyor (2) has a plurality of juxtaposed conveying runners, which

is greater than half the number of the conveying runners (15) of the
conveyor (2), plus a further conveying runner and that preferably the

spacing between adjacent runners (15) is at least as large as their width,

Means according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
