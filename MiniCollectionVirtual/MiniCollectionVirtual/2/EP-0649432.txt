<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to certain novel amide derivatives of formula (I) which are pyrido (3,4-d) pyrimidin-7-ylacetamides which are inhibitors of human leukocyte elastase (HLE), also known as human neutrophil elastase (HNE), making them useful whenever such inhibition is desired, such as for research tools in pharmacological, diagnostic and related studies and in the treatment of diseases in mammals in which HLE is implicated. The invention also includes intermediates useful in the synthesis of these amide derivatives, processes for preparing the amide derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing such amide derivatives and methods for their use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain heterocyclic amides,
in particular, certain pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-7-ylacetamides, which
are inhibitors of human leukocyte elastase (HLE), also known as human
neutrophil elastase (HNE), making them useful whenever such inhibition
is desired, such as for research tools in pharmacological, diagnostic
and related studies and in the treatment of diseases in mammals in
which HLE is implicated. For example, HLE has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), rheumatoid
arthritis, atherosclerosis, pulmonary emphysema, and other
inflammatory disorders, including airway inflammatory diseases
characterized by increased and abnormal airway secretion such as
chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis. Also, HLE has been implicated
in certain vascular diseases and related conditions (and their
therapy) in which neutrophil participation is involved or implicated,
for example, in hemorrhage associated with acute non-lymphocytic
leukemia, as well as in reperfusion injury associated with, for
example, myocardial ischaemia and related conditions associated with
coronary artery disease such as angina and infarction, cerebrovascular
ischaemia such as transient ischaemic attack and stroke, peripheral
occlusive vascular disease such as intermittent claudication and
critical limb ischaemia, venous insufficiency such as venous
hypertension, varicose veins and venous ulceration, as well as
impaired reperfusion states such as those associated with
reconstructive vascular surgery, thrombolysis and angioplasty. The
invention also includes intermediates useful in the synthesis of these
heterocyclic amides, processes for preparing the heterocyclic amides,
pharmaceutical compositions containing such heterocyclic amides and
methods for their use.In U.S. Patent 4,910,190, of 20 March 1990, assigned to
ICI Americas Inc.(now Zeneca Inc.), there is disclosed a series of
peptidoyl trifluoromethane derivatives which are HLE inhibitors.
Disclosed herein is a series of substituted 2-(2,4,8-trioxo-1,2,3,4,7,8-hexahydropyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-7-yl)-N-(3,3,3-trifluoro-1-alkyl-2-oxopropyl)acetamides
which unexpectedly possess inhibitory 
properties against HLE, which provides the basis for the present
invention.According to the invention there is provided a Compound of the
invention which is a compound of formula I (formula set out, together
with other formulae referred to by Roman numerals, following the
Examples) wherein:
R0 is (1-5C)alkyl;R1 is hydrogen, NReRf; orR1 is
