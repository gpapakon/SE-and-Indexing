the dissolved processing agents to an automatic processing 

apparatus for a silver halide photographic light-sensitive 
material which has a processing tank (351) and a circulating path 

for a processing solution (3511) provided in the processing tank (351). 
The device includes a dissolving tank (500) for storing a dissolved 

solution therein, and a processing solution supplier provided 
between the processing tank (351) and the dissolving tank (500) 

independent of the circulating path, which supplies the 
processing solution from the processing tank to the dissolving 

tank. The device further includes a replenisher to replenish 
the dissolved solution from the dissolving tank (500) to the 

processing tank (351). The dissolving tank (500) and the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic processing
machine (hereinafter referred to also as an automatic
processor) for a silver halide photographic light-sensitive
material (hereinafter referred to also as a light-sensitive
material), and more specifically, to a device of dissolving
and replenishing solid processing agents that supplies solid
processing agents to the automatic processor mentioned above.In recent years, Japanese Patent Publication Open to
Public Inspection No. 127341/1993 (hereinafter referred to as
Japanese Patent O.P.I Publication) and others disclose, from
the viewpoint of laborsaving for operators, a means for
dissolving solid processing agents used for processing silver
halide photographic light-sensitive materials. The device 
described in the above-mentioned official gazette is a device
for preparing a replenisher by dissolving processing agents of
a powder type automatically and for supplying the replenisher
to an automatic processing machine, emphasizing that
operations of operators can be reduced because processing
agents are dissolved automatically.However, in the case of the aforementioned dissolving
device wherein a large quantity of replenishers are normally
prepared through dissolving at a time, when a processing
volume per day is small, for example, the replenishers are
forced to stay in a dissolving tank for a long time and
thereby are deteriorated by aerial oxidation because a
quantity of color developing replenishers prepared already to
be supplied to an automatic processor is small. Therefore,
replenishers deteriorated gradually are supplied to the
automatic processor, which has proved to have problems that
photographic performance is deteriorated and oxidized
developing agents stick to light-sensitive material, causing
smudge thereon and unstable processing characteristics.In addition to the above, it is impossible to replenish a
replenisher solution that is being dissolved while the
replenisher is being prepared. Therefore, replenishment is
suspended. When the replenishment suspension time is long,
continuous processing is suspended and thereby the working
property is deteriorated remarkably. For the problems
mentioned above, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 
127341/1993 discloses a technology wherein a dissolving device
is equipped with a reservoir tank for a prepared replenisher.
However, this technology still has a problem that a dissolving
device itself needs to be large in size because a dissolving
tank and a reservoir tank are provided
