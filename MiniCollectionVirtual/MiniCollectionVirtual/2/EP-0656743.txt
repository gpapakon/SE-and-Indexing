<ABSTRACT>
A recharging system (99) for a battery operated tool such as a lawn mower (10). A slidable cover (22) alternately exposes a receptacle (26) adapted to receive a removalble fuse (28) or circuit breaker key (28) and an electrical power cord (34). The receptacle (26) and the electrical connector (24) are longitudinally aligned with the cover (22) so that for the cover (22) to move to the open position and exposes the electrical connector (24), the key must be removed (28). When the key (28) is removed to expose the electrical connector (24), the motor circuit is broken which prevents the electric motor (16) from being activated whether or not the activation switch (42) is engaged. When the cover (22) is moved to the closed position exposing the receptacle (26), completing the motor circuit (99) enabling the activation switch (42) to activate the electric motor (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a recharging system
for use with a battery powered tool, and more particularly
to an access prevention system for a battery
powered tool.Recently, on-board chargers for battery
operated tools have become desirable. When rechargeable
batteries of battery operated tools are being recharged,
it is essential that the motor be disengaged or inoperable.
The system to be utilized with such on-board
chargers should prevent the motor from being engaged
while the battery is being recharged regardless of the
position of the activation switch. For the system to
operate effectively, it must be user friendly. If the
system for engaging and disengaging the motor circuit is
difficult to operate, then operators are likely to
attempt to devise a method to by-pass the system,
defeating the benefits thereof.In battery operated tools not having on-board
rechargers, preventing activation of the motor when the
tool is being recharged has been accomplished by various
methods. An example of one approach is in U.S. Patent
No. 3,696,593 to Froud et al., which discloses a receptacle
and two plugs which have obstructing members such
that the plug corresponding to normal operation of the
motor must be removed and a recharging plug must be
inserted thereby preventing activation of the motor. A related approach is disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 3,581,480 to O'Connor et al., which contains two
plugs, one for normal operation of the motor and one for
recharging the battery such that to recharge the battery
it is first necessary to unplug the first plug thereby
preventing activation of the motor.A more recent approach appears in U.S. Patent
No. 5,085,043 to Hess et al., which discloses an electro-mechanical
interlock and module system for lawn
mowers or other electrical devices having the features
set forth in the preamble portion of claim 1. A
mechanical key is adapted to be inserted into a
specially configured opening in a top of a motor
shroud. The key activates a plunger of a normally
open interlock switch, thereby
closing the switch and enabling the lawn mower power
circuit. An integral tab simultaneously blocks the
charging ports so the operator cannot connect a male
plug from an outlet - mounted charging transformer while
the power circuit is enabled. When the key is removed,
the interlock switch-returns to an "off" position and
the power circuit of the lawn mower is disabled. When
the key member is removed, the charging port is exposed
permitting connection of the charger circuit to the
charging

<CLAIMS>
A battery operated tool (10)having an
electric motor (16), a battery (14) and an activation

switch (42), shiftable between an ON and an OFF
position for selectively activating said motor, said

tool comprising:

a housing (18);
a receptacle (26) electrically connected in
series with said activation switch, said battery and

said motor to form a motor circuit (99);
an electrical connector (24) within said
housing for receiving an electrical power cord (34),

said connector cooperating electrically with said
battery; and
a removable key (28) adapted to be inserted
into said receptacle;

   characterised by a cover (22) cooperating
with said housing (18) and said key (28), said cover

movable between an open position allowing access to
said connector (24) and a closed position preventing

access to said connector, said cover oriented relative
said receptacle (26) such that said key (28) must first

be removed from said receptacle (26) before said cover
(22) may be moved to said open position, wherein

removal of said key (28) breaks said motor circuit
thereby preventing motor operation while the battery is

recharging.
A tool as claimed in claim 1, wherein said cover
slidably cooperates with said housing, said cover slides

between said open position and said closed position
along a predetermined path within said housing.
A tool as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said receptacle
is located adjacent said connector such that

movement of said cover toward said open position exposes
said connector and prevents access to said receptacle,

and movement of said cover toward said closed position 
exposes said receptacle and prevents access to said

connector.
A tool as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein said key
comprises a fuse or circuit breaker affixed to a handle removably seated

within said receptacle, such that said key, when seated
abuts said cover to prevent slidable movement of said

cover toward said open position.
A tool as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, wherein said key
further includes attachment means for attaching said key

to said tool such that when removed from said receptacle,
said key remains attached to said tool.
A tool as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, wherein said connector
is a conventional electrical connector.
A tool as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, further comprising a
transformer and a rectifier circuit wherein the transformer

is provided with a primary winding connected to
the electrical connector and a secondary winding providing

a reduced voltage AC power supply to the rectifier
circuit which converts the AC power to DC, said rectifier

circuit operatively connected to the battery.
A tool as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, comprising a
battery operated lawn mower.
