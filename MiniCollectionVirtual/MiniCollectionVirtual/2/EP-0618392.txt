<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a clamping device for 
semipermanently fixing a part, such as a fluid conveying 

hose, dustproof bellows, axial boot or the like, on the 
circumferential surface of an desired mating device. 

According to this invention, even if such part looses its 
elasticity owing to aging, the clamping device maintains 

the permanent stable firm clamping state. For this 
purpose, the inner and outer overlap portions (11a, 11b) of 

the clamp band (11) are forced by an operating tool to 
spread until the seizing tooth (18a) of the inner overlap 

portion (11a) and the fixed tooth (22b) of the outer 
overlap portion (11b) seize each other, thereby contracting 

the bore diameter of the clamp band (11). This state is 
locked by a prop key (23) extending from the outer overlap 

portion (11b) to engage the inner overlap portion (11a), 
while an elastic hump (25) for storing the spring force 

acting circumferentially of the clamp band (11) is 
outwardly bulged from the outer overlap portion (11b).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a clamping device including a clamp 
band of metal strip material cut to a fixed length, said clamp 
band being wound in a circular ring for three-dimensionalization 
such that an inner overlap portion terminating in one 
roll-bent end and an outer overlap portion terminating in the 
other end overlap each other by a fixed amount, the bore diameter 
of said clamp band being artificially forcibly contractable 
for fixing a part to be fixed, such as a fluid conveying 
hose, dustproof bellows, axial boot or the like made of plastic 
material, such as rubber or synthetic resin, on the connecting 
circumferential surface of a desired mating device. More particularly, the invention provides improvements in a 
clamping device used for semipermanently fixing a fluid conveying 
hose, dustproof bellows, axial boot or the like made of 
a plastic material, such as rubber or synthetic resin, to the 
connecting circumferential surface of a desired mating device. A clamping device of the type mentioned above and recited in 
the preamble of claim 1 is known from US-A-5 191 684. Such so-called 
open type clamping device comprises a clamp band of metal 
strip material cut to a fixed length and wound into a circular 
ring with one end overlapping the other, whereby said 
clamp band is three-dimensionalized. When connecting a rubber 
hose for conveying various fluids to the cylindrical mouthpiece 
portion of a joint pipe, cock or the like by that clamping 
device, the bore diameter, i.e. the inner diameter of the 
clamping device provided around the rubber hose, is then artificially 
forcibly contractively deformed and the opposite ends 
of the clamp band are locked together. This occurs in an operation 
of the close or squeeze type.  
 For such locking together, the clamp band is provided at the 
end of the inner band portion with hooks which are adapted to 
engage an aperture and a slot-like opening in the other end of 
the clamp band. In that case, although the clamp band does not develop 
springiness to expand or contract in circumferential direction, 
since said rubber hose to be fixed is usually made of a 
rubber material having a relatively low hardness (elasticity) 
with a Shore hardness of about 60 or less, the clamp band 
closely contacts the rubber hose throughout the circumferential 
surface thereof; thus, the rubber hose or the like can be 
held on a desired mating device in a stable tightened state 
without any danger of deviation or slipping off. However, parts to be fixed, such as

mentioned from the nose (12) toward an intermediate portion 

(11c) where the clamp band (11) does not overlap,
