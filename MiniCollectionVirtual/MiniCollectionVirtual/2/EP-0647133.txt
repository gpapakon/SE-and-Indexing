<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to methods of delivering pharmaceutical agents across membranes, including the skin layer or mucosal membranes of a patient. A pharmaceutical agent is covalently bonded to a chemical modifier, via a physiologically cleavable bond, such that the membrane transport and delivery of the agent is enhanced.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR ENHANCED DRUG DELIVERYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to methods for improving the transport and delivery of pharmaceutical agents across membranes. More particularly, the invention relates to methods for enhancing the transport and delivery of pharmaceutical agents through the addition of one or more chemical modifiers to the pharmaceutical agent.The therapeutic efficacy of pharmaceutical or therapeutic agents relies on the delivery of adequate doses of a pharmaceutical agent to the site of action. Many modes of delivery have been developed, including, for example, enteral (oral) , parenteral (intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous) , and topical administration. In most instances the administration system is chosen for reliable dosage delivery and convenience.Typically, parenteral administration is the most reliable means of delivering a pharmaceutical to a patient. See, Goodman et al . , Goodman and Gilman's Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Pergamon Press, Elmsford, New York (1990) and Pratt et al . Principles of Drug Action: The Basis of Pharmacology, Churchill Livingstone, New York, New York (1990) . Each parenteral mechanism insures that a prescribed dosage of the pharmaceutical agent is inserted into the fluid compartment of the body where it can be transported. The disadvantage of these modes of delivery is that they require an invasive procedure. The invasive nature of administration is inconvenient, painful and subject to infectious contamination.Enteral and topical administration are more convenient, generally non-painful, and do not predispose to infection; however, both are limited. The gastrointestinal and dermal surfaces present formidable barriers to transport and therefore, some pharmaceutical agents are not absorbed 

across these surfaces. Another drawback to patient directed modes of administration (enteral, topical and subcutaneous) is compliance. Pharmaceutical agents that have a short half-life require multiple daily doses. As the number of doses increases, patient compliance and therapeutic efficacy decrease. Simplified and/or less frequent administration schedules can aid in optimizing patient compliance. Wilson et al. (1991) Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. 12th Ed., McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York, New York. The skin is an efficient barrier to the penetration of water soluble substances, and the rate of transdermal pharmaceutical agent absorption is primarily determined by the agent's lipid

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method of modifying a pharmaceutical agent comprising covalently bonding a chemical modifier to the pharmaceutical agent by a physiologically cleavable bond, such that the delivery or transport of the agent through membranes is enhanced.
2. The method of Claim 1 wherein the chemical modifier covalently bonded to the pharmaceutical agent forms a pharmaceutical agent-chemical modifier complex which is administered to a patient's skin or mucosal membrane, wherein the chemical modifier is cleaved from the complex by a physiological procesε, and the pharmaceutical agent iε released within the patient.
3. The method of Claim 1 wherein one or more chemical modifierε are covalently bonded to the pharmaceutical agent.
4. The method of Claim 3 wherein the chemicals modifiers are positively charged or negatively charged.
5. The method of Claim 3 wherein the chemical modifiers are selected from the group consisting of taurine, betaine, carnitine, oligomeric carnitine, choline, lysine, polylysine, methylated amino acids, trigonelline, stachydrine, betonicine, histones, nucleotide-baεed chemical modifier, cytochrome c, εqualamine, chonemorphine, conessine, and quaternary ammonium salts.
6. The method of Claim 3 wherein the pharmaceutical agent is selected from the group consisting of digital.is drugs, steroidal compounds, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, protein and peptide drugε, nucleotide-based drugs, and nitrogen heterocycles. 


 7. A method for the delivery of a pharmaceutical agent, comprising the steps of: a) binding one or more chemical modifiers to the pharmaceutical agent through physiologically cleavable covalent bonds thereby forming a pharmaceutical agent-chemical modifier complex; b) contacting the a patient's skin with a therapeutically effective amount of the complex in an iontophoretic device; and c) applying an electric field to the interface of the complex and the skin, such that the electric field transdermally delivers the complex.
8. The method of Claim 7 wherein the transdermal delivery of the complex is enhanced over the transdermal delivery of the agent alone.
9. The method of Claim 7 wherein one or more chemical modifiers are covalently bonded to the pharmaceutical agent.
10. The method of Claim 9 wherein the chemical modifiers are positively charged or negatively charged.
11. The method of Claim 9 wherein the chemical modifiers are selected from the group consisting of taurine, betaine, carnitine, oligomeric carnitine, choline, lysine, polylysine, methylated amino acids, trigonelline, stachydrine, betonicine, histones, nucleotide-based chemical modifier, cytochrome c, squalamine, chonemorphine, conesεine, and quaternary ammonium εaltε.
