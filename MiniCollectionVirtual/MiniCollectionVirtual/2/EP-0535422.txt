<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric power 
steering apparatus for assisting the force required to turn 
the steering wheel of a vehicle. An electric power steering apparatus for a vehicle uses 
an electric motor to assist the steering force required to 
steer the vehicle. The electric power steering apparatus 
includes a steering mechanism which is linked via a shaft to 
a steering wheel and which is provided with a non-contact 
torque sensor for detecting the rotational force applied at 
the steering wheel, as well as the electric motor for assisting 
the operation of the steering mechanism; the electric 
motor is driven in response to the torque detected by 
the torque sensor to lessen the steering force at the steering 
wheel. Such a torque sensor is described in EP-A-0 362 890. The torque sensor has the construction shown, for 
example, in Fig.1. Fig.1 is a cross sectional view of a 
torque sensor used in a conventional electric power steering 
apparatus. The reference numeral 1a designates an input 
shaft connected to a steering wheel (not shown), and the  
 
input shaft 1a is concentrically connected through a torsion 
bar 1c to an output shaft 1b connected to a steering mechanism 
(not shown). At the connection between the input shaft 
1a and the output shaft 1b, there is mounted a non-contact 
torque sensor 2 which contains in its housing 21 a magnetic 
coupler 22 chose magnetic coupling changes in accordance 
with the twisting of the torsion bar 1c. The torque sensor 
2 detects the change in the magnetic coupling and performs 
predetermined signal processing on the detected change to 
measure the steering torque applied to the torsion bar 1c. 
A signal processing circuit (not shown) formed on a torque 
sensor circuit board 23 disposed outwardly of the magnetic 
coupler 22 within the housing 21 is used for the signal 
processing. The result of the signal processing by the signal 
processing circuit (the torque detection signal) is inputted 
to a control circuit 30 formed on a control circuit board 
(not shown) disposed at a preset place outside the torque 
sensor 2. The control circuit 30 controls the driving of 
the electric motor according to the steering torque measured 
by the torque sensor 2.  
 A further steering torque detecting apparatus for use in 
an electrically-operated power steering system is disclosed 
in US-A-4 907 668. However, this document is 
silent concerning the control apparatus for the steering 
assisting motor. It is the object of the invention to provide an
