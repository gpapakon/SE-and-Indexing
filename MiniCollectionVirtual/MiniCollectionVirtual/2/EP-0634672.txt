<ABSTRACT>
In order to average out thermal noise but to magnify 
small value photon signals resulting from a gamma ray 

event in a scintillation camera having an array of 
photodetectors (50) arranged in rows (R1-R4) and columns 

(C1-C4), the photon signals are summed (58) for each row 
and summed (60) for each column as a first step in the 

processing of the signals. As a second step the summed 
signals are weighted (62R,C) in accordance with an 

approximation to an energy distribution curve, and the 
weighted signals are then further weighted and summed 

(66R,C) for determining the position of the gamma ray 
event.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for signal processing in scintillation cameras
employed for nuclear medicine. Such scintillation
cameras are also known as gamma cameras or Anger cameras
and are more generally referred to as position and
energy sensitive radiation detectors.A common type of camera is shown in Figure 1. An
area (2) of a body (4) of a patient containing a
radioactive pharmaceutical, emits gamma rays indicated as
at (6). The camera (8) includes a collimator comprising
an apertured lead sheet (10) so that only gamma rays
within a predetermined narrow angle from the patient can
pass through the collimator to a scintillation block (12)
of NaI(Tl). Single gamma rays entering block (12) give
rise to a large number of secondary photons which radiate
outwards through a glass light guide and support block
(14) to an array of photomultipliers (16).
Photomultipliers (16) are usually arranged in a
rectangular or hexagonal grid. Each photomultiplier tube
is arranged to detect individual photons or groups of
photons to produce a significant electrical signal which
is conducted to a signal processing unit (18). Unit (18)
assesses all the signals received from the individual 
photomultiplier tubes to carry out an analysis of the
signals received at consecutive time instants in order to
determine approximately where each gamma ray impinges on
scintillation block (12).Position reconstruction in a gamma camera is usually
performed by taking a linear weighted mean of the signals
of the photomultiplier array, see for example US-A-4228515.
Problems arise with signals from photomultipliers
far from a gamma ray event where only a very small
number of photons are detected. Since the statistical
noise fluctuations are proportional to the square root of
number of photons detected, the fluctuation in small
signals is comparable to the signal itself. Because of
this relatively large statistical noise fluctuation some
form of limiting has to be applied to the smallest
signals to exclude noise in order to obtain better
spatial resolution. This may be done with a thresholding
device, for example a diode, which provides a fixed
thresholding level and which therefore only passes
signals from a photomultiplier tube having a voltage
level greater than the junction voltage of the diode.
Whilst this provides a simple way of excluding low value
signals which have a large amount of noise associated
therewith, some useful information is also discarded.
Now each gamma ray incident will create a distinctive
