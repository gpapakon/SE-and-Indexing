<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a silicon nitride powder 
used for production of silicon nitride ceramics products. 

The powder can provide a compact having homogeneous packing 
structure of powder, constantly and with good 

reproducibility. To produce the powder of the invention a 
silicon nitride powder is heat treated in a two-stage 

process comprising one stage in an inert gas or reducing 
atmosphere at 100°C-1000°C for 5-600 min., and another 

stage in an oxidising atmosphere at 300°C-1200°C for 5-600 
min. As a result of this treatment, a silicon nitride 

powder is obtained in which its powder particles are 
crystalline in their interior and are coated with an 

amorphous layer having a 1-10 nm surface thickness and 
composed mainly of Si, N, O, and H, the atomic number ratio 

of oxygen to nitrogen (O/N) of the surface layer being 
within a range of 0.1-2.0.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to material powder
used for fabrication of silicon nitride ceramics products
which are used for various types of structural materials
such as automobile parts. More particularly, the invention
relates to surface characteristics of silicon nitride
material powder essential to obtain a high-strength, high-reliability
sintered body.Silicon nitride ceramics are lightweight,
superior in heat-, corrosion-, and wear-resistance, and
well-balanced in strength and toughness, so that they are
expected to be put into practical use in a wide range of
applications such as engine parts of automobiles and gas
turbine engines. However, the silicon nitride ceramics are
brittle such that their mechanical characteristics are
largely affected by various defects present in the interior
of the sintered body. Among others, their strength
characteristic is vulnerable to defects such as voids,
impurities, or coarse particles and flaws. These parts
have stresses concentrated thereon enough to make sources 
of fracture, causing the strength of the sintered body to
lower to a substantial extent. As a result, silicon
nitride ceramics have hitherto been lacking in reliability
required to be a practical material.A silicon nitride sintered body is obtained by
firing and thereby solidifying powder. In more detail, a
material powder mixed with a sintering assistant or the
like is compacted, and heated in a firing oven, whereby the
powder particles are sintered with one another to form a
polycrystalline body. Therefore, microstructure of a
sintered body will be intensely affected by the
characteristics of the material powder.Conventionally, it has been assumed that the
silicon nitride material is preferably provided by a powder
that has a high α-fraction of crystal phase, finer
particles, and as small amounts of metal impurities as
possible, for the purpose of implementing a sintered body
homogeneous and less in defects. In view of this, material
manufacturers have competitively developed material powders
having high α-fractions, fine particles, and high degrees
of purity. As a result, there has become commercially
available high-quality materials of which the α-fraction is
over 90%, mean particle size is under 1 µm, and iron
content is under 100 ppm. This has contributed to a
substantial reduction in generation of impurities and 
coarse particles contained in the sintered body. Thus, the
frequency of occurrence of fractures due to these defects
has lowered with adjusted sintering conditions.Further, there
