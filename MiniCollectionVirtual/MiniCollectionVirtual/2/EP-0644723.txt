<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a gel coated food substrate comprising: a) applying an aqueous batter dispersion having sodium ion sources, calcium ion sources or a combination of sodium ion sources and calcium ion sources, to the surface of a food substrate to form a batter-food substrate complex; b) contacting the batter-food substrate complex with a dry bread material to form a breaded complex; and c) applying an aqueous gel-forming solution to the breaded batter-food substrate complex to form a thermally irreversible gel film around the complex.

<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONA PROCESS FOR MAKING GEL-COATED FOODSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe invention relates to a process for coating a food substrate with dry bread material and a gel forming substance.It is well known to form a film around food products such as seafood, meat, poultry, vegetables, cheese and dough products for effective results with respect to shelf life and product integrity. Earle et al., United States Patent 3,255,021 and Earle United States Patent 3,395,024 exemplify the prior art process of using two solutions to form an alginate film which will hold and bind products together and encapsulate same, thereby retarding oxidation, rancidity, dehydration and moisture m ation.Earle et al., United States Patent 4,504,502 describes a food product made by applying an aqueous dispersion containing water soluble algin to the surface of a food substrate, and applying a dry gelling mixture to the algin-coated food substrate for a period of time sufficient to form a substantially continuous edible film along the surface of the food product.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe invention is a process for preparing a gel coated food substrate comprising:a) applying an aqueous batter dispersion having sodium ion sources, calcium ion sources or a combination of sodium ion sources and calcium ion sources, to the surface of a food substrate to form a batter-food substrate complex; b) contacting the batter-food substrate complex with a dry bread material to form a breaded complex; and 

 c) applying an aqueous gel-forming solution to the breaded batter- food substrate complex to form a thermally irreversible gel film around the complex.Preferably, the process includes the application of flour to the food substrate prior to step a).The gel-forming solution comprises one or more gel-forming polysaccharides which form gels in the presence of sodium ions, calcium ions, or a combination of sodium ions and calcium ions. The aqueous gel-forming solution is preferably applied by spraying means. More preferably, the gel- forming polysaccharide is water soluble algin or gellan gum. The preference for water soluble algin or gellan gum depends on the conditions at which gel formation is desired.If gel formation is desired at elevated temperatures, e.g. above room temperature, gellan gum is preferred. Because sodium ions and calcium are both effective for forming gellan gum gels, either sodium ion sources or calcium ion sources, or both, are suitable for batter preparation.If gel formation is desired at room temperature or
