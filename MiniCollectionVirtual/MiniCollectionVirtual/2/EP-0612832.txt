<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein is a flame retardant hydraulic oil 
excellent in the flame retardancy, unaccompanied by the dangers 

of pinhole fire at sites of use and giving rise to no 
environmental contamination. 
This flame retardant hydraulic oil contain a hydraulic base 
oil comprising as the essential component an polyol partial 

ester which is a product formed by reacting (A) a polyol having 
a total of 6 to 22 carbon atoms and a total of 3 to 6 hydroxyl 

groups with (B) an acyclic monocarboxylic acid having a total 
of 6 to 22 carbon atoms. Said polyol partial ester has a 

hydroxyl value of 35mgKOH /g or more, a flash point of 290°C 
or higher and an average molecular weight of 600 to 1,500.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a use of a polyol partial ester as the essential component of a base oil of a flame retardant hydraulic
oil to be used in rolling mills, die casting machines and the
like in the fields of the steel making industry and the nonferrous
metal industry and in hydraulic instruments and the
like in the construction industry. More particularly, the corresponding
flame retardant hydraulic oil is excellent in the
flame retardancy, unaccompanied by the dangers of pinhole fire
at sites of use and giving rise to no environmental
contamination.Generally, it is essential that the flame retardant
hydraulic oils have the following characteristics:
(1) they are excellent in viscosity-temperature properties
to ensure the transmission of pressure and power,(2) they have appropriate viscosities to minimize the loss
of pressure and power,(3) they are excellent in the heat stability, oxidative
stability and lubricity to provide the longer service life,(4) they are excellent in the demulsibility to protect from
the possible mixture of water, and(5) they have flash points high enough not to permit the
continuous burning even if they are ignited, since it is quite
likely that they are used where there are high risks of fire.As the flame retardant hydraulic oils, there have been 
conventionally used those of emulsion series, those of water-glycol
series, those of phosphoric acid ester series and those
of fatty acid ester seriesHowever, the hydraulic oils of emulsion series and those of
water-glycol series are short on the heat stability, oxidative
stability and lubricity, accompanied by the difficulty to
dispose of waste water. Furthermore, the hydraulic oils of
phosphoric acid ester series have the shortcomings that their
viscosity-temperature properties and hydrolytic resistance are
deficient; they are responsible for the deterioration of seal
materials and the exfoliation of coats; and it is not easy to
dispose of waste water oil by burning.On the other hand, the hydraulic oils of fatty acid ester
series are good in all of said points and have found their
application in wide segments of market. But they have the
shortcomings that they are short on the fire resistance and
flame retardancy. Various studies have been conducted in an
attempt to find the solution in the problems incidental to the
hydraulic oils of fatty acid ester series. In fact, the
technique covering the flame retardant hydraulic oils of fatty
acid ester series has been disclosed, for example in Japanese
