<ABSTRACT>
Bank notes (14) are transferred by a conveyor (15) along a moving path, and an image sensor (17) disposed 
in the proximity of the moving path of the bank notes (14) converts the code printed on the bank notes (14) to electric 

signals. A printer (19) automatically prints out the read codes on the basis of the output of the image sensor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a document handling apparatus, more
particularly, to an apparatus for recording on paper, patterns printed on documents or
the like.Bill validators are used in various fields including automatic vending
machines, ticket venders, automatic money deposition machines and so forth. The
fundamental techniques for validation of bills or bank notes are mainly divided into
optical and magnetic validation methods. In the optical validation method,
photosensors are utilized to measure an amount of light reflected on a surface of a bill
or permeated through a bill so that dimensions and printed conditions of the bill are
represented by electric signals from the photosensors in order to decide authenticity of
the bill. Also, in the magnetic validation method, magnetic sensors are employed to
measure magnetic characteristics of the bill for judgment of the authenticity. There
are some cases of adopting a stricter combined method of the optical and magnetic
validation as occasion demand.For example, Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 60-77287 shows a bill handling
apparatus which includes a bill conveyor device and a magnetic head for bill
validation; and U.S. Patent No. 4,628,194 teaches a bill validator with optical and
magnetic sensors.BE-A-1002 886 indicates a method and apparatus for protecting bills wherein a
character reader reads out numbers printed on bills using pattern recognition; and 
EP-A-477 711 describes a bill examination device provided with a photo or magnetic
detector for scanning the bill to test the authenticity of the bill.Under current heavy international traffic, there are many cases to require bills
to be exchanged between local and foreign money. If exchanged money includes
counterfeit bills, unexpected troubles would occur with owners of the money in good
faith. Accordingly, at the time of finding out such fake notes, it is convenient to
identify or confirm a banking facility or exchanger agency who exchanged the bills
before. However, it in fact is quite difficult at present to record all symbols or
numbers printed on exchanged bills and to reserve these records at the banking
facilities or exchanger agencies.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for
automatically recording on printing paper, symbols printed on documents, removing
the above mentioned defects in prior arts.According to the present invention, a document validating apparatus which
includes a validator sensor disposed along a passageway of a document for
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A document validating apparatus (10) which includes a validator sensor (16)
disposed along a passageway of a document (14) for detecting an optical or magnetic

feature of said document (14) passing through said passageway; a read controller
means (20) having validation means for validating the authenticity of the document

(14) by outputs from said validator sensor (16); conveyor means (15) being
driven by outputs from said read controller means (20) for transporting said document

(14) along the passageway;

a passage detecting sensor (24) for detecting passage of said document (14);
image sensor means (17) disposed adjacent to said passageway for converting
an image of a symbol printed area (18) on said document (14) into electric image signals and

forwarding said electric image signals to said read controller means (20);
said read controller means (20) for activating said image sensor means (17)
according to an output from said passage detecting sensor (24) when the symbol

printed area (18) on the document (14) passes through said image sensor means (17); and
symbol detector means (61) provided in said read controller means (20) for
detecting whether said read controller means (20) receives from said image sensor

means (17) a full amount of the image signals, corresponding to the full area (18), along the transported direction of the
document (14); characterised by:-
printing means (19) for printing the image of the symbol printed area (18)
forwarded from said image sensor means (17) without pattern recognition; and
said read controller means (20) activating said printer means (19) after said read 
controller means (20) decides that the document (14) is genuine and said symbol

detector means detects the full amount of the image signals of the symbol printed area
(18) along the transported dir
ection of the document (14).
An apparatus (10) as claimed in claim 1 in which said document (14) is a bill.
An apparatus (10) as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which said conveyer means (15)
transports the document (14) out of the passageway through an outlet (13) when said

symbol detector means detects a full amount of the image signals of the symbol
printed area (18) along the transported direction of the document (14);


said conveyer means (15) returns the document (14) to an inlet (12) by reverse
rotation of said conveyer means (15) when said read controller means (20) decides

unauthenticity of the document (14);
said conveyer means (15) stops transportation of the document (14) at the
outlet (13) when said symbol detector means cannot detect a full amount of the image

signals of the symbol area (18), although said read controller means (20) detects
authenticity of the document (14).
An apparatus (10) as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, in which said read controller
means (20) detects an inserted condition of the conveyed document (14) and forwards

varied arrangement of the output signals to said printer means (19) when the
document (14) is conveyed in the reverse direction.

controller means (20) has a memory device (32) for storing the output signals from

means (19) prints on printing paper the kind of the document and the image of the

symbol printed area (18) on the document (14) according to the output signals from
