encoded by HCV for use as reagents for screening of blood and blood products for 

prior exposure to HCV. The peptides are at least 5 amino acids long and can be used 
in various specific assays for the detection of antibodies to HCV, for the detection of

<DESCRIPTION>
The implementation of systematic testing for hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been 
instrumental in eliminating this virus from the blood supply. Nevertheless, a significant 
number of post-transfusion hepatitis (PTH) cases still occur. These cases are generally 
attributable to non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) virus(es), the diagnosis of which is usually 
made by exclusion of other viral markers. The etiological agent responsible for a large proportion of these cases has recently been 
cloned (Choo, Q-L et al. Science (1988) 244:359-362) and a first-generation antibody test 
developed (Kuo, G. et al. Science (1989) 244:362-364). The agent has been identified as a 
positive-stranded RNA virus, and the sequence of its genome has been partially determined. 
Studies suggest that this virus, referred to subsequently as hepatitis C virus (HCV), may be 
related to flaviviruses and pestiviruses. A portion of the genome of an HCV isolated from 
a chimpanzee (HCVCDC/CHI) is disclosed in EPO 88310922.5. The coding sequences disclosed 
in this document do not include sequences originating from the 5'-end of the viral genome 
which code for putative structural proteins. Recently however, sequences derived from this 
region of the HCV genome have been published (Okamoto, H. et al., JapanJ.Exp.Med. 
60:167-177, 1990.). The amino acid sequences encoded by the Japanese clone HC-J1 were 
combined with the HCVCDC/CHI sequences in a region where the two sequences overlap to 
generate the composite sequence depicted in Figure 1. Specifically, the two sequences were 
joined at glycine451 . It should be emphasized that the numbering system used for the HCV 
amino acid sequence is not intended to be absolute since the existence of variant HCV strains 
harboring deletions or insertions is highly probable. Sequences corresponding to the 5' end 
of the HCV genome have also recently been disclosed in EPO 90302866.0. In order to detect potential carriers of HCV, it is necessary to have access to large 
amounts of viral proteins. In the case of HCV, there is currently no known method for 
culturing the virus, which precludes the use of virus-infected cultures as a source of viral 
antigens. The current first-generation antibody test makes use of a fusion protein containing 
a sequence of 363 amino acids encoded by the HCV genome. It was found that antibodies 
to this protein could be detected in 75 to 85% of chronic NANBH patients. In contrast, only 
approximately 15% of those patients who were in the acute phase of the disease, had 
antib
