<ABSTRACT>
A bend piece (10) (in the H and E planes) for waveguides is proposed, which can be produced using the diecasting process by virtue of its design configuration, and enormous price advantages compared to bend pieces manufactured to date using the lost-wax casting process are thereby achieved. The bend piece (10) has a fastening flange (16) for one rectangular waveguide (14) and a plug-in support (18) for the other rectangular waveguide (13), which support is open towards the flange face (161). As a result, in addition to the manufacturing advantage, a flange connection is dispensed with.

Angle piece for waveguide connections with two connection
openings (11, 12) for a respective waveguide tube (13, 14),

their normals being oriented at right angles to one
another, and with at least one deflection surface (15)

located between the connection openings (11, 12), its
normal enclosing an acute angle to the normals of the

connection openings (11, 12), characterised in that one
connection opening (11) is arranged in the flange surface

(161) of a connection flange (16) and the other connection

opening (12) as well as the deflection surface (15) are
constructed in a cap (17) integral to the connection flange

(16), and that an insertion groove (18) open towards the
flange surface (161) and arranged directly in front of the

connection opening (12) is moulded in the cap (17) to
positively receive an end section of a waveguide tube (13)

in such a way that, when the waveguide tube (13) is
inserted, the inner contour of the waveguide tube (13) is

flush with the connection opening (12) and the outer
contour of the tube wall (131) of the waveguide tube (13)

closing the insertion groove (18) is flush with the flange
surface (161).
Angle piece according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
clear dimensions of the insertion groove (18) coaxial to

the connection opening (12) are selected to be double the
wall thickness of the waveguide tube (13) to be used

compared to the corresponding clear dimensions of the
connection opening (12).
Angle piece according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the end section of the waveguide tube (13) inserted

into the insertion groove (18) is fixedly and electrically
conductively connected to the cap (17).
Angle piece according to Claim 3, characterised in that the 
the fixed connection of the waveguide tube (13) and the cap

(17) is formed by an electrically conductive metal adhesive
applied to the abutting surfaces of the insertion groove

(18) and the waveguide tube (13).
Angle piece according to Claim 3, characterised in that the
the fixed connection of the waveguide tube (13) and the cap

(17) is formed by an electrically conductive solder.
Angle piece according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the connection flange (16) has

insertion holes (22) for insertion of connection elements
(21), preferably connection screws.
Angle piece according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised by its production using the pressure

diecasting process.
