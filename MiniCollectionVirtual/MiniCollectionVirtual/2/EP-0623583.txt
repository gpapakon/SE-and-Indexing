<ABSTRACT>
Dialkyl carbonates can be prepared by reaction of carbon monoxide with alkyl nitrites in a continuous gas-phase reaction, a platinum metal catalyst on a metal phosphate being employed as a support and hydrogen halide being added batchwise or continuously in the course of the reaction. The dialkyl carbonates are formed in this process in nearly quantitative selectivity; the corresponding dialkyl oxalates are formed in such low amounts that in most cases they cannot be detected.
