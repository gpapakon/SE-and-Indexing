<ABSTRACT>
An expandable tubular reinforcing member (10, 20, 35) of the
invention is used for a body lumen, such as a blood vessel for

reinforcement. The reinforcing member is formed of a tortuous
section (12, 13, 22, 23, 36) having a plurality of laterally

extending elongated members (15, 25, 26, 37, 38), and a plurality
of vertically extending end members (16, 27, 28, 40) situated

between two adjacent elongated members for connecting the same.
The tortuous section is arranged diagonally to form a cylindrical

shape with a first diameter extending in a spiral form. The
elongated members generally extend parallel to a central axis of

the cylindrical shape. A plurality of joint members (18, 29, 41)
is situated between two end members arranged in the cylindrical

shape to keep the shape. When a radial force is applied from an
inside of the reinforcing member, the elongated members are bent

relative to the end members to thereby allow the tubular
reinforcing member to have a second diameter larger than the first

diameter to thereby hold the body lumen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a flexible stent to be implanted
within body lumen, such as an artery, to maintain patency thereof.
"Stent" here is defined as a prosthetic member used for reinforcing
the blood vessel, and is very useful in the treatment of
atherosclerotic stenosis in blood vessels.When the body lumen is weakened, for example, dissectional
artery lining occurs in a body lumen such as a blood vessel, the
weak part of the body lumen might collapse to occlude a fluid
passageway. To prevent such an occlusion, a stent is implanted
within the blood vessel to support the blood vessel from the inside
thereof. Namely, a stent is delivered to a desired location in the
blood vessel, and expanded in a circumferential direction in the
blood vessel to support and maintain the patency of the blood
vessel. Using the stent to support the blood vessel can avoid
surgical exposing, incising, removing, replacing or bypassing a
defective blood vessel required in the conventional vascular
surgery.There have been introduced various types of stents, and they
can be typically categorized from viewpoints of methods for
expanding the stent, shapes, methods for manufacturing the stent,
designs and so on. From a viewpoint of methods for expanding the
stent, stents can be categorized as a self-expandable stent which
can be expanded by itself, and a balloon expandable stent. In the
balloon expandable stent, the stent is mounted on an expandable 
member, such as a balloon, provided on a distal end of an
intravascular catheter, and the catheter is advanced to the desired
location in the body lumen to deliver the stent. Then, the balloon
on the catheter is inflated to expand the stent into a permanent
expanded condition, and the balloon is deflated for removing the
catheter from the stent.From a viewpoint of materials, stents can be categorized into
a tubular stent and a wire stent, and from a viewpoint of methods
for manufacturing the stent, stents can be categorized as an etched
stent and a laser cut stent. Then, from a viewpoint of designs,
stents can be categorized into numerous types, but roughly, stents
can be categorized into a stent having a zigzag pattern on the
surface thereof, and a stent having a diamond pattern on the
surface thereof.Further details of prior art stents can be found in U.S.

An expandable tubular reinforcing member (10, 20, 35) used for
a body lumen comprising,


a tortuous section (12, 13, 22, 23, 36) having a plurality of
laterally extending elongated members (15) formed of one kind of

long members (25, 37) and one kind of short members (26, 38)
arranged one after the other, and a plurality of vertically

extending end members (16, 17, 27, 28, 40) situated between two
adjacent elongated members for connecting the same, said tortuous

section being arranged diagonally to form a cylindrical shape with
a first diameter and extending in a spiral form so that the

elongated members generally extend along a central axis of the
cylindrical shape, and
a plurality of joint members (18, 29, 41) extending between
two end members arranged in the cylindrical shape and situated

adjacent to each other so that when a radial force is applied from
an inside of the reinforcing member, the elongated members are bent

relative to the end members to thereby allow the tubular
reinforcing member to have a second diameter larger than the first

diameter.
An expandable tubular reinforcing member (10, 20) according to
claim 1, wherein said tortuous section (12, 13, 22, 23) includes:


a first tortuous member (12, 22) having a plurality of first
lateral members (15, 25, 26) and a plurality of first vertical

members (16, 28) situated between two adjacent first lateral
members for connecting the same, said first tortuous member

extending continuously from an end to an end,
