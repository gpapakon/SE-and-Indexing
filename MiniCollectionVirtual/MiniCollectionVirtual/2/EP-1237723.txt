<ABSTRACT>
There are disclosed methods and systems for the process of on-press plate imaging, including automatic processes for plate preparation, that compensate for registration and print-length errors (plate loading is performed before imaging). As a result of these processes, the position accuracy is determined by the imaging system. The system of the present invention creates deformed images on the plates during the imaging stage, these deformed images, being such that the separations will be in register (coordinated) after printing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This patent application claims priority from and is related to U.S. Provisional
Patent Application S/N 60/157,856, entitled: DIGITAL OFFSET PRINTING
REGISTRATION, filed on October 6, 1999, this Provisional Patent Application
incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.The present invention is directed to lithography, and in particular, to
compensating for deformities in color separations by imaging correspondingly
deformed images on printing plates, such that these plates will print the color
separations in register.Conventional lithography processes typically replicate images by
transferring ink from a previously prepared plate onto a substrate, typically
paper. In offset printing, this transfer is done indirectly by a soft blanket that is
stamped by the plate. This soft blanket then impresses this image onto paper.Color images are obtained by separating the image into four color
process plates, these four colors corresponding to Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and
Black, commonly known as "CMYK", that are then combined on paper. If an
image is to be accurately represented, all four color separations must have the
same length, scale and position when impressed on the paper. However, this is
difficult, as there may be misalignment and scale errors, these errors being
classified as either fixed errors or paper errors.Fixed errors are errors in misalignment and scale that do not change from
image to image. These errors are typically caused by tolerances of the prepress
imaging devices, errors produced during development of the imaged plates,
errors in mounting the plates on the printing press cylinders, and errors of the
printing press mechanisms. Errors of the printing press mechanisms typically 
include plate cylinders having lost their roundness from wear or the like, and
loosening of gears, bearings, etc., typically from wear over time.Paper errors typically result from paper wetting by fountain solution and ink,
and by forces applied on the paper by the printing press, that tend to deform the
paper. With the paper deformed, data is printed at undesired or unintended locations.
Even when the deformation forces on the paper are released, the paper does not
usually recover to its original configuration, and thus, there is a difference between
the data (on the imaged printing plate) and the resultant printed image.Paper deformation effects, that result in paper errors, are explained by Figs.
1A-1C. Specifically, Fig. 1A shows the desired or ideal situation where a rectangular
