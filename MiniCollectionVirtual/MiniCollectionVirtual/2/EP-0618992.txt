<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hinge apparatus according to
the precharacterizing part of claim 1.Automotive vehicles have one or more deck lids, such
as a trunk lid, which typically use a hinging device
incorporating two torsion bars extending between two hinges
mounted on the vehicle and connected to one end of two straps.
The other ends of the straps are connected to the closure
panel or deck lid. The torsion bars counter-balance the
weight of the deck lid and enable the deck lid to be more
easily moved between raised and lower positions.This hinge construction requires that the torsion
bars and the strap hinges or pivot connections be assembled
on the vehicle separately. Due to the location of the torsion
bars below the rear shelf of the vehicle, installation and
service of the torsion bars and the hinges is difficult and
time consuming. Furthermore, two workers acting in concert
are needed to attach the torsion bars between the two strap
pivots or hinges which further adds to assembly time.A deck lid hinge using torsion bars also creates
packaging difficulties within the vehicle trunk since the
torsion bars extend transversely across the trunk. The
torsion bars take up space within the trunk and interfere with
other vehicle components, such as the sound system speakers
mounted on the parcel shelf. Further, torsion bars are noisy
in operation, are sensitive to alignment, and do not perform
particularly well due to high internal friction. As a result,
the hinge counter-balance function is often times reduced to
a brake which holds the deck lid open at any arbitrary
position or is so powerful that it causes the deck lid to rise
uncontrollably to its maximum opening position where it slams
into stops, vibrating the entire vehicle and can even deform 
the sheet metal of the vehicle. The torsion bar hinge
assembly is costly in terms of the number of separate
components required for its assembly and its lengthy
installation time. Further, the torsion bars are heavy which
is a disadvantage in view of the desirability of reducing
weight in current vehicles for increased fuel economy.In order to increase available trunk space, the
space below the parcel shelf where the torsion bars are
typically mounted is being further limited. Finally, deck
lids are becoming increasingly heavier due to added tail lamp
assemblies, trunk and luggage racks, and spoilers thereby
requiring higher counter-balance spring forces which results
in larger and more costly torsion bars.Other hinge arrangements have also been developed
to

<CLAIMS>
A hinge apparatus (10) for a pivotal closure panel (12)
movable between first and second positions to open and close an

opening in a compartment, the compartment formed by a fixed
structure surrounding and forming the opening, the hinge

apparatus (10) comprising:

a mounting plate (16) fixedly attachable to the structure
surrounding the opening in the compartment;
a strap (14) having first and second ends, the first end
(24) being pivotally connected to the mounting plate (16), the

second end (28) of the strap being fixedly attachable to the
closure panel (12);
a biasing spring (18) having first and second ends, the
first end (56) of the spring (18) being connected to the

mounting plate (16), the second end (82) of the spring being
rotationally movable with respect to the first end (56); and
a link (20) having first and second ends, the first end of
the link being pivotally connected to the strap (14) at a

position spaced from the pivotal connection of the first end of
the strap to the mounting plate (16), the second end of the

link (20) being connected to the second end (82) of the spring
and movable therewith, the link (20) having a predetermined

selectable length to generate a variable moment arm depending
on the angle between

un axis extending between the first and second ends of the link and an axis extending between a center of the
spring (18) and the connection of the second end of the link to

the second end (82) of the spring to vary the force exerted by
the biasing spring (18) on the strap (14) to control the

movement of the strap (14) between the first and second
positions, 
characterized
 in that the link (20) is a single
link, the second end of the link (20) being pivotally connected

to the second end (82) of the spring (18) which is wound in a
plurality of turns about the first end (56), the second end

(82) of the spring (18) being variably radially movable with
respect to the first end (56) and the link (20) being disposed

substantially in line with the first end (24) of the strap
(14), when the strap (14) and the closure panel (12) are in the

second position closing the opening in a compartment, to remove 
substantially all of the force exerted by the biasing spring

(18) through the link (20) and the strap (14) to the closure
panel (12).
The hinge apparatus of Claim 1 further comprising:
means (42,81) for stopping rotation of the link (20) at

a first angular position as the closure panel (12)
approaches the first position, with the axis extending

between the first and second ends of the link disposed
at a predetermined angle with respect to the axis

extending through a center (44) of the biasing spring
(18) and the connection between the second end of the

biasing spring (18) and the second end of the link such
that the link transmits force from the biasing spring

(18) to maintain the closure panel (12) in the first
position.
The hinge apparatus of Claim 2 wherein the rotation
stopping means com
prises a stop (42) mounted on the
mounting plate (16) and engaging the link (20) at a

predetermined angular position of the link(20).
The hinge apparatus of Claim 3 wherein the
predetermined angular position of the link (20) is at

an angle of substantially 150Â° between the axis
extending between the first and second ends of the link

(20) and an axis extending through the center (44) of
the biasing spring (18) and the connection between the

second end (82) of the biasing spring (18) and the
second end of the link (20).
The hinge apparatus of Claim 2, 3 or 4, wherein the
rotation stopping means comprises:


first flange means (81), mounted on the link (20), for
engaging the mounting plate at a selected angular

position of the link.
The hinge apparatus of one of the claims 2 - 5 wherein
the rotation stopping means further comprises:


means for stopping rotation of the link at a second
angular position with respect to the strap as the

closure panel approaches the second position.
The hinge apparatus of Claim 6 wherein the rotation
stopping means comprises:


second flange means, mounted on the link, for engaging
the mounting plate as the link reaches the second

angular position.
The hinge apparatus of one of the claims 1 - 7 further

spring force adjustment means (96,100), coupled to the
biasing spring, for allowing rotation of the first end

(56) of the biasing spring in only one direction to
