<ABSTRACT>
In fuel gasification, particles (5) of e.g. coal 
and an oxidant (6) are supplied to a reactor (1), 

where the coal particles (5) are gasified. The gas 
(7) thus produced may contain molten slag entrained 

therein and such slag could subsequently solidify and 
affect other components of the coal gasification 

apparatus. Therefore a molten slag cooling heat 
exchanger (16) is positioned directly above the 

reactor (1) and this cools the gas (7) so as to cause 
any molten slag therein to solidify. Hence, such 

molten slag does not reach an evaporator (23) above 
the molten slag cooling heat exchanger (16), so that 

the efficiency of the evaporator (23) will be 
maintained. However, solidified molten slag may build 

up on heat exchange tubes of the molten slag cooling 
heat exchanger (16). Therefore, the rate of coolant 

(18) supplied to the molten slag cooling heat 
exchanger is varied, to cause expansion and 

contraction which causes solidified slag to be 
dislodged. Hence the efficiency of the molten slag 

cooling heat exchanger (16) does not deteriorate. 
Cleaning gas (25) and coal particles (28) may be 

jetted onto the evaporator (23) to dislodge ash or 
soot therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of fuel 
gasification, in which fuel, such as particles of 
coal, are gasified in a reactor. The present 
invention also relates to a fuel gasification 
apparatus for carrying out such a method. In known fuel gasification arrangements, coal is 
pulverized to form particles, and is fed to a reactor, 
together with an oxidising agent such as air or 
oxygen. The coal is gasified in the reactor and 
produces a high temperature gas. Solid slag produced 
from the coal falls to the bottom of the reactor, and 
may be removed therefrom. The gas produced from the 
coal gasification flows upwardly out of the reactor, 
and is caused to pass over at least one, normally a 
plurality, of heat exchangers which remove the heat 
therefrom. Examples of such coal gasification arrangements 
are disclosed in, for example, JP-A-61-218962, JP-A-61-221293, 
JP-A-61-241394, and JP-A-61-250094. In JP-A-61-218962 
and JP-A-61-241394, the heat exchangers 
are positioned in a column located above the reactor, 
so that the gas passes directly from the reactor to 
the heat exchangers. In JP-A-61-221293 and JP-A-61-250094,  
 
the heat exchangers are located in a separate 
column, with the gas passing to the top of that column 
and moving downwardly therein. In the known fuel gasification arrangements 
discussed above, the gasification of the coal 
particles results in the formation of slag. If the 
slag is solid, it will fall to the bottom of the 
reactor as previously described. However, it has been 
found that some of the slag is in liquid or even vapor 
form, and such slag (hereinafter referred to as 
"molten" slag) is entrained in the flow of the gas 
from the reactor, and is thus carried towards the heat 
exchangers. At the heat exchangers, the exchange of 
heat from the gas to the coolant of the heat exchanger 
causes the temperature of the molten slag to fall, and 
this may result in the molten slag solidifying. The 
effect of this is that molten slag may be deposited on 
the heat exchangers. Such depositing of solidified 
slag is undesirable, because it reduces the efficiency 
of the heat exchangers. Therefore, the present invention proposes that 
the supply of coolant to at least one of the heat 
exchangers be varied. This varies the temperature of 
the at least one heat exchanger. The effect of such temperature variation is to 
cause expansion and contraction of the heat exchanger, 
as its temperature changes, and this dislodges the  
 
solidified slag from the heat exchanger. Thus,
