<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the energetics and may be used in the systems of 
ignation and control of the process of burning-up the fuel mixtures, in particularly, 
in the internal combustion engines.
 
It is known the methods of burning-up the fuel mixture wherein its inflamation 
is effected by feeding the high-frequency pulses to the electrodes, connected 
to the secondary winding of the ignition coil.
 
It is known also the system of ignition providing for forming the high-frequency 
voltage pulses in the interelectrode gap, comprising the current 
source, ignition coil, electronic switch, connected with the primary winding 
of the ignition coil, pulse generator, output thereof is connected with the 
electronic switch, and at least one sparking plug. The drawback of the above mentioned methods and device is that they 
don't provide for sufficient complete combustion of fuel and decrease of toxicity 
level of combustion products, because at the forming of the high-frequency 
pulses of ignition the changes of the parameters of the fuel mixture 
in the process of its burning-up are not taken into account.
 
The object of the invention is the improvement of the effectiveness of the 
combustion process and completeness of fuel burning-up and decrease of 
the toxicity of the combustion products. The object is achieved by the method of burning-up the fuel mixture, wherein 
its inflamation by feeding the high frequency voltage pulses to the electrodes, 
connected to the secondary winding of voltage, and in the process  
 
of burning-up the air fuel mixture the frequency of voltage pulses is altered 
in relation to the breakdown voltage of the burning fuel mixture.
 
The shaper of the feedback signal, input thereof is connected with the point 
of connection of the ignition coil with the electronic switch and output is connected 
with the second input of pulse generator is introduced into the ignition 
system of the embodyment of this method, comprising current source, 
ignition coil, electronic switch, connected with the primary winding of the ignition 
coil, pulse generator, output thereof is connected with the electronic 
switch, and, at least, one sparking plug. The figure presents the functioning scheme of the ignition system for embodyment 
of the suggested method of burning-up the air fuel mixture. Ignition system comprises current source 1, ignition coil 2, electronic switch 
3, connected with the primary winding of the ignition coil 2, pulse generator 
4, the output thereof is connected with the
