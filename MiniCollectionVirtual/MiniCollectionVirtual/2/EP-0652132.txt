<ABSTRACT>
A motor vehicle (1) for transporting interchangeable boxes is provided with a chassis (2) which extends from the region of a front wheel axle located underneath a driver's cab (5) into the region of at least one rear wheel axle, the said chassis (2) having a load receiving area which has locks (10) for interchangeable boxes (9). The chassis (2) is constructed as an essentially three-component composite unit (11) which has a front chassis component (12) which is provided in the standard design of a small van, a load chassis component (13) with low-level cross-sectional frame and an intermediate frame component (14) which connects the two chassis components. In the region of the load chassis component (13), at least one pneumatic spring crank axle (17, 18) is provided by means of whose spring bellows (19, 20, 19', 20') which are connected to a pneumatic spring control the composite unit can be moved into at least two lift positions.

A motor vehicle for transporting interchangeable containers,
of which the chassis (2) extending from the area of a front

wheel axle (4) disposed under a driver's cabin (5) and into
the area of a rear wheel axle (6, 7) is provided with a

load-receiving area (8) comprising locking means (10) for an
interchangeable container (9), the said load-receiving area

(8) being adapted to be lowered by means of a crank drive
out of its raised position (H) which constitutes the riding

position into a second raised position (H2) which releases
the interchangeable container, characterised in that the

chassis (2) is constructed as a substantially three-part
composite unit (11) consisting of a front chassis part (12)

provided in the standard form of construction of a small
transporter, a load-bearing chassis part (13) with a dropped

cross-sectional frame and an intermediate frame part (14)
connecting the two chassis parts (12, 13) and in that there

are in the region of the load-bearing part (13) two air
spring crank drives (17, 18) each with two spring bellows

(19, 20; 19', 20') which are connected by a compressed air
control arrangement.
A motor vehicle according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the composite unit (11), by means of respective supporting,

centring and rapid-locking members (50, 47, 52) so
accommodate the interchangeable container (9) in the raised

position (H) which constitutes the riding position, that the
interchangeable container has a supported position

accessible via a step-on board (22) which is supported on
the load-bearing chassis (13).
A motor vehicle according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the composite unit (11) can by means of the spring

bellows (19, 20; 19', 20') be so positioned in an upper
raised position (H1) which releases respective supporting 

members (21) for the interchangeable container (9) that
afterwards the interchangeable container (9) can be set down

in a free-standing loading and unloading position.
A motor vehicle according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the wheels disposed on the air spring

crank drives (17, 18) are effectively constructed as 8" or
10" wheels.
A motor vehicle according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the load-bearing chassis part (13) is

provided with two longitudinal members (31, 32) on the
respective ends of which there are two cross-members (33,

34) which support at their ends the supporting and centring
members (10) for the interchangeable container (9), the said

cross-members having an end portion (36, 37, 38, 39) which
projects freely beyond the area (35) of connection to the

longitudinal members (31, 32).
A motor vehicle according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the longitudinal members (31, 32) of

the load-bearing chassis part (13) are at the back and in
the region of the rear cross-member (34) provided with

extension parts (40, 41) which support the step-on board
(22).
A motor vehicle according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the intermediate frame part (14) has

two longitudinal struts (43, 44) supported at one end on an
intermediate strut (42) disposed between the longitudinal

members (31, 32) of the load-bearing chassis part (13) and
which are at their other end connected to the front chassis

part (12) by means of respective flange parts (15, 16). 
A motor vehicle according to Claim 7, characterised in that
the longitudinal struts (43, 44) of the intermediate frame

part (14) engage under the leading cross-member (33).
A motor vehicle according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that as centring members (10) there is,

connected via a bracing profile part (46) to the cross-member
(33, 34) of the load-bearing chassis part (13), a

centring mushroom (47), of which the cross-sectionally
conical receiving surface (48) merges into a lateral surface

(49) of which at least parts are cylindrical.
A motor vehicle according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that, as a supporting member (50) for the

interchangeable container (9), a rubber pad (51) is disposed
on each cross-member (33, 34) in the region of the

respective centring mushroom (47).
A motor vehicle according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that as rapid locking members (52), locking

wedges (53) are provided and are disposed in the respective
connecting areas (35) between longitudinal members (31, 32)

and cross-members (33, 34).
A motor vehicle according to Claim 11, characterised in that
the locking wedge (53) can be so moved by a pushing motion

(S) extending substantially parallel with the longitudinal
axis (30) of the vehicle that a run-on surface (54) on the

locking wedge (53) engages behind a mating member disposed
in the bottom area of the interchangeable container (9).
A motor vehicle according to Claim 11 or 12, characterised
in that the four locking wedges (53) disposed in the corner

areas of the load-bearing chassis part (13) can be 
respectively moved individually via a mechanical, electrical,

hydraulic and/or pneumatic drive means (55).
A motor vehicle according to one of Claims 1 to 13,
characterised in that the composite unit (11) has in the

region of the supporting members on the load-bearing part
(13) a load plane (23) with a load height (L) of 45 to 60 cm

and preferably 54 cm.
A motor vehicle according to one of Claims 1 to 14,
characterised in that the centring mushrooms (47) are

disposed on the load-bearing part at a distance away
