<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a perfected 
process and relative system for producing column 
radiators. Column radiators comprise two manifolds connected 
hydraulically by a number of columns. The process currently used for producing column 
radiators comprises:
 
   a stage for producing the manifolds and columns, 
and forming a number of holes in the manifolds; and
 
   a stage wherein the columns are placed between the 
manifolds, the manifolds are pressed firmly towards each 
other, and the axial ends of the columns are electrode 
welded or soldered to the edges of the holes formed in 
the manifolds. The above process presents several drawbacks. In particular, it results in the formation of 
unsightly weld beads which are difficult to remove; and 
in increased production cost due to the slow operating 
speed of the welding system.  It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a process for producing column radiators, 
designed to overcome the above drawbacks. It is a further object of the present invention to 
provide a system for producing column radiators, and 
which also provides for overcoming the above drawbacks. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a process for producing column radiators 
defined by two manifolds hydraulically connected by a 
number of columns; characterized in that it comprises:
 
   a first step wherein said manifolds and said 
columns are placed inside a die;
 
   a second step wherein said die is transferred by 
first drive means to a welding station;
 
   a third step wherein second drive means move at 
least one laser head up to the portions for welding; and
 
   a fourth step wherein, for each said column, said 
laser head provides for CO2 laser welding the end edge 
of said column to a hole formed in one face of said 
manifold. According to the present invention, there is also 
provided a system for producing column radiators defined 
by two manifolds hydraulically connected by a number of 
columns; characterized in that it comprises:
 
   a welding station;
 
   at least one CO2 laser source;
 
   at least one laser head;
 
   an arm supporting said laser head;
 
 
   first drive means for moving said arm along a 
first vertical longitudinal axis;
 
   a body fitted to a frame and supporting said arm;
 
   second drive means for moving said body along a 
second horizontal axis;
 
   third drive means for moving said arm along a 
third horizontal axis;
 
   a die housing said radiator;
 
   fourth drive means for moving said die to and
