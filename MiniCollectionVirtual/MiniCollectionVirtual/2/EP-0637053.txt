<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electron tube, in particular X-ray tube with a cathode arrangement which comprises an electron emitter which is connected to supporting pins which, in turn, are connected to the cathode structure in each case via one fastening element. In this case, particularly simple adjustment of the position of the heating filament results from the fact that the fastening elements in a first region are connected to cathode structures in a second region, which is at a distance from the first region, to the asssociated supporting pin and that the fastening elements have between the first and the second region a deformation region by means of the deformation of which the position of the electron emitter can be adjusted relative to the cathode structure.

<CLAIMS>
An electron tube, notably an X-ray tube, comprising a cathode
arrangement (3, 4) which includes an electron emitter (41) which is connected to

supporting pins (43) which themselves are connected to the cathode arrangement 
via
 a
respective fixing element (44), the fixing elements (44) being connected to the cathode

arrangement in a first region (441) and to the associated supporting pin (43) in a second
region (442) which is remote from the first region, said fixing elements (44) being

shaped as a sleeve in which the supporting pin is inserted 
characterized in that
 the all of
the sleeve comprises a deformation zone (443) which is situated between the first region

and the second region and consists of a bulge, deformation of said deformation zone
enabling adjustment of the position of the electron emitter relative to the cathode

structure.
An electron tube as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the inner
diameter of the sleeve is greater in the first region (441) than in the second region

(442).
An electron tube as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the cathode
arrangement comprises a main body (48) of metal, at least one of the fixing elements

(44) being connected to the main body (48) 
via
 a ceramic body (45).
An electron tube as claimed in Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the ceramic
body (45) 
is provided with a connection tag (47) which is in electrical contact with the
fixing element (44).
