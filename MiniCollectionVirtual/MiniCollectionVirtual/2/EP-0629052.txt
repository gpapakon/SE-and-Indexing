<ABSTRACT>
After calculation of syndrome by 
use of syndrome registers [S0 to S3]
 
(15 to 18), the value of the syndrome 

register (15) is loaded in the syndrome 
registers (16 to 18), and the values of the 

syndrome registers (16 to 18), in the data 
registers [R1-R3]
 (22 to 24), respectively, 
when there is a singlet error. By use of 

the syndrome registers (15 to 18), power 
operation of µ, µ², and µ³ is repeated 

until coincidence detection circuits (25 to 
28) detect coincidence of the values of 

the syndrome registers (15 to 18) with 
the data registers (22 to 24). A counter 

(29) is operated in synchronism with the 
power operation. When the coincidence 

is detected, the count value is defined as 
the location of data which includes an 

error. The error is corrected by assuming 
the value of the syndrome registers [S0]
 
(15) to be its magnitude.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an error correction
method and an error correction circuit and, particularly to an
error correction method and an error correction circuit for use
in error correction in digital data processing apparatus, such
as reproducing apparatus for reproducing a CD (compact disc) and
a DAT (digital audio tape) or the like.An error correction code of CD is formed by
interleaving 2-stage Reed-Solomon codes and referred to as CIRC
(Cross Interleaved Reed-Solomon Code). The 2-stage Reed-Solomon
codes used in the CIRC are referred to as C1, C2, respectively.When error is corrected by the C1 code, for example,
error-correction is carried out at the unit of 32 byte-data in
which 4-byte parity data are added to 28-byte data. The 32-byte
data are referred to as x0 to x31, respectively.4-byte parity data are selected such that all of four
equations on [Equation 1] yield "0"s:
Data thus generated are recorded on the disc, and 
recorded data contains error due to various causes when
reproduced.Data (data containing errors) received by an error
correction circuit after they had been read out from the disc
are respectively referred to as x0' to x31' in order that they
can be distinguished from data recorded on the disc.When error correction is implemented in actual
practice, data is received and then syndromes S0 to S3 are
calculated based on [Equation 2]:
Galois field theorem proved that there exists a finite
field having 28 elements. This finite field is expressed as
GF(28).Codes used in the CD are defined by generator
polynomial on [Equation 3]:
P(x) = x8 + x4 + x3 + x2 + 1Then, α is a root of equation established when P(x) =
0.Study of [Equation 2] reveals that, if received data
contains no error, then S0 = S1 = S2 = S3 = 0 (parity data are
added for this reason). Conversely, if any one of syndromes
were not "0", data error could be detected. Although the syndrome should be calculated based on
the [Equation 2] prior to the error correction, if the syndromes
were calculated as described above, then the number of
calculation would be increased.Therefore, [Equation 2] is modified as [Equation 4]:
The syndrome S1, for example, can be calculated in
accordance with an algorithm shown in FIG. 3. Other syndromes
S0, S2, S3 also can similarly be calculated by changing a
predetermined power of α variously.This calculation can be implemented by a circuit
composed of an adder 41 supplied at one input thereof with
received data, a register 42 for storing added data from the
adder 41 and a

<CLAIMS>
An error correction method comprising the steps of:

calculating (S1) n syndromes from received data, n being a positive integer
determined by a number of parity words contained in said received data, and storing

a single syndrome in a single syndrome register, said single syndrome representing
an error amount if error is a single-error, and storing other syndromes in n-1

syndrome registers;

   characterised by the following steps:

after calculation of syndromes is ended, loading the values stored in said n-1
syndrome registers into n-1 data registers and loading the value stored in said single

syndrome register into all of said n-1 syndrome registers (S2);
multiplying the contents of each of the n-1 syndrome registers by a power of
α such that the i
th
 syndrome register is multiplied by α
i
, where i is an integer from
1 to n-1 and α is a root of a generator polynomial 
on Galois field (S6);
repeating this multiplication step until it is detected that the value stored in
each of the n-1 syndrome registers is equal to the value stored in the respective n-1

data register (S4);
incrementing a count each time the above multiplication step is performed (S7)
whereby, if the value of the count is greater than the length of the received data, the

error is uncorrectable (S11), otherwise, once no more multiplication steps are performed,
the value of the count is equal to the location of a single error in the received data

and the value in said single syndrome register is equal to the error amount (S9); and
effecting error correction based on said error location and said error amount.
An error correction circuit comprising:

means (11-21) for calculating n syndromes from received data, n being a
positive integer determined by a number of parity words contained in said received

data, and storing a single syndrome in a single syndrome register (15), said single
syndrome representing an error amount if error is a single-error, and storing other

syndromes in n-1 syndrome registers (16-18);

   characterised by means for implementing the following steps: 

after calculation of syndromes is ended, loading the values stored in said n-1
syndrome registers (16-18) into n-1 data registers (22-24) and loading the value stored

in said single syndrome register into all of said n-1 syndrome registers (16-18);
multiplying (19-21) the contents of each of the n-1 syndrome registers (16-18)
by a power of α such that the i
th
 syndrome register is multiplied by α
i
, where i is an
integer from 1 to n-1 and α is a root of a generator polynomial on Galois field;
repeating this multiplication step until it is detected (25-28) that the value
stored in each of the n-1 syndrome registers (16-18) is equal to the value stored in the

respective n-1 data register (22-24);

whereby, if the value of the count is greater than the length of the received data, the

error is uncorrectable, otherwise, once no more multiplication steps are performed,
the value of the count is equal to the location of a single error in the received data

and the value in said single syndrome register (15) is equal to the error amount; and
effecting error correction based on said error location and said error amount.
