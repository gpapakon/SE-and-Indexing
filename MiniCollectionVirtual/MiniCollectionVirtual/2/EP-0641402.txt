<CLAIMS>
A process for the continuous production of surface 
dyeings on cellulose fibers present in the form of 

textile materials, characterized in that the textile 
materials are initially treated with an aqueous liquor 

which contains 

(i) at least 5 g/l of benzyl halide-quaternized condensation 
products of precondensates of trialkanolamines 

and ureas, cyclic carbonates and/or epihalohydrins 
and/or benzyl chloride-quaternized condensation 

products of piperazine and epichlorohydrin 
and 
(ii) 0.02 to 1 g/l of a phosphoric triester whose alcohol 
component is derived from aliphatic, aryl-substituted 

aliphatic alcohols, phenols or alkyl-substituted 
phenols having in each case 6 to 18 carbon atoms in 

the alcohol or phenol radical, 
 
the textile materials thus treated are then dyed with 

reactive dyes in another bath in an aqueous medium, and 
subsequently the dyes are fixed in a conventional manner 

by treatment with an alkaline liquor, and the dyeing is 
finished. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the textile materials are treated with the aqueous 

liquor which contains the compounds (i) and (ii) at 15 to 
95Â°C. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the aqueous liquor, as well as the 

compounds (I) and (II), additionally contains (iii) 0.1 
to 1 g/l of a nonionic wetting agent.
