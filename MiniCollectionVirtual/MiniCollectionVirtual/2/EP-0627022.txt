A device for the electrolytic coating of small parts with 
electrical conductivity, in particular metal parts, wherein 

the device comprises a bath of electrically conductive fluid 
coating medium, the bath is in electrically conductive 

communication with the one pole of a direct current source 
(cathode or anode), while the article to be coated is in 

electrically conductive communication with the other pole 
(anode or cathode) of the direct current source and the device 

consists of a worm conveyor (1) with loading and unloading 
openings at its conveyor pipe ends and with conveyor worms 

inside the conveyor pipe, the inner side of its conveyor pipe 
(2) has electrically conductive contacts (3), which are 

connected to the one pole of the direct current source, and 
that the worm conveyor (1) is inserted with a part of its 

cross section into an immersion basin which is connected to 
the other pole, characterised in that the immersion basin (4) 

is disposed beneath the end of the pipe (2) at the front in 
the conveying direction and extends from a region located at a 

distance in front of the small part supply opening to beyond a 
part, in particular roughly the half, of the length of the 

pipe (2), the front edge (7) and the side edges (8) of the 
immersion basin (4) forming the coating medium weir edge, the 

weir edge at the rear in the conveying direction is formed by 
a region (9) of the worm plate (6), the shortest distance of 

which to the lowest point of the pipe (2) is at least equal to 
the overflow line (5) of the weir edges, preferably protruding 

above this overflow line (5), with the edge (10) of the 
immersion basin (4) lying at the rear in the conveying 

direction abutting in sealed manner the outer wall of the pipe 
in the region of the worm plate forming the rear weir edge, 

with the pipe (2) comprising a coating medium drain (12) in 
the region following this region in the conveying direction. 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
worm conveyor (1) is constructed as a worm plate.  

 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
worm conveyor (1) is constructed as a conveyor pipe (2), whose 

circumferential pipe (2) is the small part bearing component 
and has a worm plate (6) fixed to the inner circumference as a 

thrust component, with the open ends of the conveyor pipe (2) 
forming the small part supply and the small part discharge 

openings. 
A device according to Claim 1 or 3, characterised in that 
the height of the worm plate (6) in the region of the small 

part supply opening to the region (9) forming the rear weir 
edge is lower than the level (5) in the pipe determined by the 

weir. 
A device according to Claim 1, 3 or 4, characterised in 
that the pipe (2) is perforated (at 13) at least in the 

circumferential region directly following in the conveying 
direction of the rear edge of the immersion basin (4), and 

preferably also in the coating zone located in the conveying 
direction in front of said region. 
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that a collection basin (14) is disposed beneath the 

immersion basin (4) and beneath the perforated region (13) of 
the pipe (2). 
A device according to Claim 6, characterised in that the 
device includes a coating medium feed pump (15), the inlet of 

which is connected to the collection basin (14) and the outlet 
of which leads into the immersion basin (4) or preferably to a 

spray device (18), which is inserted into the front pipe 
opening and enters the coating zone of the pipe (2). 
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised 
in that the pipe (2) is made from plastic or other 

electrically non-conductive material, in the region located 
from the opening to the end of the coating zone is covered by  

 
knob-like contact pins (3), which on the inner side of the 

pipe protrude from the pipe wall in the manner of mushrooms 
and on the outer side of the pipe in the circumferential 

direction and/or in the axial direction are connected to one 
another by outwardly electrically isolated contact rails (19), 

wherein the contact rails (19) are run to a circumferential 
conductor rail (20) which is attached close to the pipe end on 

the outside of its casing and which is connected via sliding 
or rolling contacts (21) to one pole of the current source. 
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised 
in that the device is mounted in a stand (23), which in 

addition supports bearing rollers (25) for the pipe (2), with 
the driving motor (26) being coupled with a driving pinion 

(27), which is in engagement with a toothed ring (28) attached 
to the outside of the pipe (2). 
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised 
in that the other pole of the current source is connected to a 

contact sheet (22) forming the second electrode, which is 
disposed beneath the pipe (2) in the immersion basin (4).
