<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for coating internally threaded fasteners (28), particularly closed end fasteners, such as flanged weld nuts, which includes a powder spray arrangement (20) which has a spray nozzle within a spray cylinder (48). The spray nozzle arrangement is actuated by an air cylinder (16) to be in abutting relationship with a fastener seated in the spray position. The spray nozzle (68) is tapped for the supply of air (46) and for the supply of powder (44) to the fastener threads. The spray cylinder (48) is tapped at a position just above its open lower end to form a vacuum exhaust (56). As a result, excess powder in the area of the coated threads of an enclosed fastener, with only one aperture for access to the threads, may be removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved
apparatus and process for the manufacture of threaded
fasteners having a coating applied to the threads, More
particularly, this invention relates to an apparatus
and method for the manufacture of coated fasteners
where it is necessary to coat the internal threads of a
fastener that are not easily accessible,, such as those
found in a closed end fastener, specifically a closed
end nut.Prior art patents disclose various methods and
devices for applying locking patches or coatings of
resilient resin, Generally, a rotatable table or
endless belt conveyor is disposed to receive fasteners
and transport them through a plurality of stations to
effect application of the coating, Examples of such
disclosures include US. Patent Nos. 4,100,882 and
4,835,819 issued to Duffy et al.In the past attempts have been made to develop
machines that could produce individual or small
quantities of sample product as well as providing high
volume production equipment with increased processing
speeds and increased versatility at reduced costs. The
attempts, however, have resulted in machines that were.
makeshift, not compact, and difficult to regulate.
Some of these problems, are disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 4,835,819. Each of the foregoing prior art patents disclose
an apparatus for the application of a coating to a
fastener that has. threads that may be accessed, from
both the top and bottom of the fastener, Such dual
access is important because it enables the spray
coating nozzle to have access to one open end of the
fastener while the other end remains open for removal
of excess coating material by a vacuum. However, a
problem arises when the fastener to be coated does not
have two open ends.United States Patent Specification No. US-A-3
422 795 discloses an apparatus for projecting a stream
of solidifiable, finely divided coating material onto
the heated internal surface of a concave object to form
thin, uniform continuous fused coating thereon,
reinforced by portions of added thickness where needed.
However, a difficulty not addressed by this Patent
specification is the application of a coating to a
fastener that has internally disposed threads and which
is accessible primarily only from one end of the
object.Such a problem persists in the coating of enclosed
fasteners such as closed end flanged weld nuts. Since
there is only one aperture for access to the threads, a
spray nozzle cannot enter one end of the nut while a
vacuum removes excess coating material or powder from
the

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for applying a powdered resin to
the threads of an internally threaded fastener (28),

comprising:

a frame (10);
a powered actuator (16) mounted on said frame
(10);
an actuating member (22) connected to and
driven by said actuator (16);
a spray block (14) for locating the fastener
(28) in a spray position;
a moveable application nozzle (20) positioned
adjacent the fastener (28) in said spray position, said

application nozzle (20) having an axial length and
carried by said actuating member (21), for insertion

into the fastener (28) and for applying said powdered
resin to the threads of the fastener (28), said threads

having surfaces positioned at an angle relative to the
path of travel of said nozzle (20);
a nozzle tip (54) located on said axial length
of the application nozzle (20) for controlling the

application of the powdered resin;
a supply assembly (44) for supplying the
powdered resin to said nozzle (20); and
vacuum means (54) for removing excess powder
that does not adhere to said threads, characterised in 

that said vacuum means (54) comprises a hollow member
coaxially disposed around said application nozzle (20)

and is disposed proximate to and on one side of the
fastener (28); said fastener (28) is a closed end

fastener; and said vacuum means (54) comprises a cavity
in said spray block (14) and adjacent said one side of

the fastener (28).
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said powered actuator (16) includes an air cylinder

(16) and said application nozzle (20) includes a spray
tube assembly substantially linearly actuated in and

out of the fastener by said air cylinder (16).
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said powered actuator (16) includes a motor and said

application nozzle (20) includes a spray tube assembly
actuated in and out of the fastener (28) by said motor.
An apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1-3,
wherein said nozzle tip (69) includes a surface for

directing the powdered resin in a direction generally
perpendicular to the motion of said nozzle (20).
An apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1-4,
wherein the fastener in said spray position is seated

within a spray block (14) and positioning of the
fastener in said spray block (14) is controlled by an

escapement mechanism (40). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 5, wherein
said escapement mechanism (40) comprises a plurality of

pistons (76, 77) positioned in the path to said spray
position of said fasteners whereby extension and

retraction of said pistons (76, 77) controls the
procession of said fasteners (28) into said spray

position.
A process for coating with a powdered resin the
threads of an internally threaded fastener (28), the

fastener (28) having at least one aperture for
receiving a spray nozzle (68), comprising:


locating said fastener (28) onto a support for
spraying;
moving a spray mechanism, including a nozzle

one aperture of the fastener (28);
spraying the powder onto the threads of the
fastener (28);
applying a vacuum proximate said one fastener
