<ABSTRACT>
A quantum well type semiconductor laser includes light 
confining layers of MQB structure comprising a plurality of 

semiconductor layers having different compositions laminated 
alternatively, and compositions, layer thicknesses of the 

layers, and the laminated layer number are adjusted so as to 
produce an energy barrier of a height higher than the energy 

barrier inherent to the material against carriers injected 
into the active layer, and the refractive index distribution 

in the vicinity of the active layer makes the electric field 
concentrated at the active layer portion, and the quantum 

barrier layers are disposed in contact with the quantum well 
structure active layer. Therefore, the light confinement 

amount into the active layer is increased as well as the 
overflow of carriers into the light confinement layer is 

suppressed, whereby the threshold current of the quantum 
well laser is reduced, and the external quantum efficiency 

is enhanced. A quantum well laser includes as a barrier 
layer constituti
ng an active layer of multi-quantum well 
structure, a barrier layer of an MQB structure that produces 

an energy barrier of a height higher than the energy barrier 
inherent to the material against the carriers injected into 

the well layer constituting a multi-quantum well structure. 
Therefore, the similar effects as above are obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a quantum well type 
semiconductor laser used in such as optical 
communication and, more particularly, to a quantum well type 
semiconductor laser that can enhance the dynamic 
characteristics of a laser. It is well known that semiconductor lasers have been 
improving their performances tremendously by introducing a 
quantum well structure into the active layer. The quantum 
well utilizes quantum size effect generated by thinning the 
layer thickness to about de Broglie wavelength, that is, 
below about 10 nm (100 Å), and when it is applied to a 
semiconductor laser, a single or periodic plural layers are 
introduced into an active layer. In such quantum well type 
laser, carriers are injected into the quantum well layer, 
and light generation and recombination occur, thereby 
obtaining a tremendously large optical gain with relative to 
the prior art bulk crystal laser. As a result, lowering of 
threshold, narrowing of spectrum line width, or enhancement 
of dynamic characteristics are realized. Figure 10 is a diagram showing a structure of a main 
part of a quantum well type semiconductor laser proposed at 
the beginning of development of a quantum well type  
 
semiconductor laser. In the figure, reference numeral 110 
designates a p type InP substrate. A p type lower cladding 
layer 120 is disposed on the substrate 110. A multi-quantum 
well structure active layer 140 comprising a plurality of 
InGaAs well layers and a plurality of InP barrier layers is 
disposed on the lower cladding layer 120. An n type InP 
upper cladding layer 160 is disposed on the quantum well 
active layer 140. An InGaAsP contact layer 170 is disposed 
on the upper cladding layer 160. A p side electrode 180 is 
disposed on the rear surface of the substrate 110 and an n 
side electrode 170 is disposed on the contact layer 170, 
respectively. Figure 13 is a diagram for explaining the operation of 
the quantum well type semiconductor laser shown in figure 
11, where figure 13(a) is an energy band diagram of 
conduction band in the vicinity of the active layer, figure 
13(b) is a diagram showing refractive index corresponding to 
figure 13(b), and figure 13(c) is a diagram showing electric 
field distribution corresponding to figure 13(a). In the
