<ABSTRACT>
A center member (6) is disposed between a pair of end members (2,4). 
A cylindrical (50) member is accepted in a hole (8) in one of said end 

members and an other cylindrical member (12) is accepted in a cavity 
formed by the cooperative arrangement of the other of the end 

members (4) and the center member (6) whereby the one and the other 
cylindrical members which are in parallel planes are coupled. 

The arrangement is such that cylindrical members of varying 
diameters and having their axes angularly displaced relative to 

each other within their parallel planes are accommodated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a coupling arrangement 
and, particularly, to a coupling arrangement for coupling a 
pair of cylindrical members which are disposed in parallel 
planes and are angularly displaced in said parallel planes 
relative to each other. A variety of devices have shafts or bars which must be 
coupled to other like cylindrical members on other devices. 
For purposes of illustration, combination basket/table top 
apparatus for use with wheelchairs is available. The apparatus 
has cylindrical legs or the like which are coupled to 
cylindrical bars which are part of the wheelchair for 
supporting the apparatus on the wheelchair. The bars and the 
legs, while being in parallel planes, are angularly displaced 
relative to each other within their planes. Prior to the 
present invention, the required coupling has been difficult to 
achieve. This invention contemplates a coupling arrangement 
including a pair of end members and a center member disposed 
between the end members, and which end and center members are 
in the same plane. One of the end members has a transversely 
extending hole which accepts a first cylindrical member of a 
finite diameter, or accepts adapters which, in turn, accept 
first cylindrical members of varying diameters. The other of 
the end members and the center member are configured and 
cooperatively arranged to provide a transversely extending 
cavity for accepting second cylindrical members of varying  
 
diameters whereby the first and second cylindrical members are 
coupled. The first and second cylindrical members are in 
parallel planes. The second end member and the center member 
have facing serrated surfaces. An arrangement is provided 
whereby the facing serrated surfaces are disengaged and 
engaged. When the serrated surfaces are disengaged, the first 
end member is angularly displaceable to a desired position 
relative to the center and second end members. The first end 
member is maintained in the desired angularly displaced 
position when the facing serrated surfaces are engaged. This 
arrangement enables coupling of first and second cylindrical 
members which have their axes angularly displaced relative to 
each other within their parallel planes. Figure 1 is a sectioned elevational view of a coupling 
arrangement for cylindrical members according to the invention. Figures 2 and 3 are diagrammatic representations 
illustrating the feature of the invention wherein adapters are 
arranged with a first end member of said arrangement so that

A coupling arrangement for coupling one cylindrical 
member in one plane to an other cylindrical member in an other 

plane parallel to the one plane, comprising: 
   a first end member; 

   a second end member; 
   a center member disposed between the first and second 

end members; 
   the first end member having a transversely extending 

hole which accepts the one cylindrical member of a finite 
diameter; 

   the center and second end members cooperating to 
provide a transversely extending opening for accepting the 

other cylindrical member of varying diameters, whereby the one 
and the other cylindrical members are coupled together; 

   the first and second end members and the center 
member being in a common plane; and 

   the first end member being angularly displaceable in 
the common plane, whereby the transversely extending hole 

accepts the one cylindrical member when said one cylindrical 
member is displaced in the one plane relative to the other 

cylindrical member in the other plane parallel to the one 
plane. 
A coupling arrangement as described by claim 1, 
including: 

   the first end member having a serrated surface; 
   the center member having a serrated surface which 

faces the serrated surface of the first end member; and
 

   means associated with the first end member and the 
center member for engaging and disengaging sa
id facing serrated 
surfaces, with said facing serrated surfaces being disengaged, 

so that said first end member is angularly displaceable in the 
common plane, and being engaged for maintaining said first end 

member in an angularly displaced position. 
A coupling arrangement as described by claim 2, 
wherein the means associated with the first end member and the 

center member for engaging and disengaging said facing serrated 
surfaces includes: 

   a hole extending axially through the first end member

threaded insert for disengaging the serrated surfaces, and 
tightened within said threaded insert for engaging said 

serrated surfaces.

including: 

   the center member having a surface opposite the 
serrated surface and a cavity extending transversely through 

said opposite surface; 
   the second end member having a surface facing the 

opposite surface of the center member and a cavity extending 
 

transversely through said surface facing the opposite surface 
of the center member; 

   the cavity extending transversely through the 
opposite surface of the center member and the cavity extending 

through the surface of the second end member facing the 
opposite surface of the center member being aligned in opposing 

relation for providing the opening for accepting the other 
cylindrical member.

end member and into the center member on one side of the 

opening;
