<ABSTRACT>
The fume extracting hood is intended in particular for use in large-scale kitchens and consists of a plurality of juxtaposed grease-trapping cells (1), each having a fume-collecting space (2) which is open at the bottom and into which leads an intake opening (4) which is connected to an exhaust air duct (3). A grease filter (5) is arranged between the intake opening (4) and the exhaust air duct (3). In the region of the intake opening (4), the grease-trapping cells (1) have a shutter carrier (7), the shutter carrier (7) being displaceable for all grease-trapping cells (1) together substantially transversely to the intake opening (4) and being adapted for the connection of closure covers (8). The closure covers (8) can be displaced by the shutter carrier (7) into a position freeing the intake opening (4) and into a position leaktightly closing the intake opening (4).

An extractor hood, in particular for use in commercial kitchens, 
comprising a plurality of grease separation cells (1) which are arranged 

side-by-side and which each have a respective downwardly open fume 
collection space (2) into which opens a suction intake opening (4) 

connected to an air discharge duct (3), wherein a grease filter (5) is 
arranged between the suction intake opening (4) and the air discharge 

duct (3), characterised in that in the region of the suction intake 
opening (4) the grease separation cells (1) have a shutter carrier (7) 

wherein the shutter carrier (7) is displaceable jointly for all grease 
separation cells (1) substantially transversely to the suction intake 

opening (4) and is adapted for the connection of closure plates (8) which 
are displaceable by the shutter carrier (7) into a position of opening 

the suction intake opening (4) or into a position of sealingly closing 
the suction intake opening (4). 
An extractor hood according to claim 1 characterised in that 
disposed above the fume collection space (2) is a chamber (10) which is 

separated off by a closing plate portion (9), for accommodating the 
shutter carrier (7) and drive means for the shutter carrier (7). 
An extractor hood according to claim 2 characterised in that the 
closing plate portion (9) is provided with a slot aperture (12) for the 

closure plate (8) to pass therethrough. 
An extractor hood according to claim 3 characterised in that the 
closure plate (8) carries a sealing strip (13) at its edge which is 

remote from the shutter carrier (7). 
An extractor hood according to claim 4 characterised in that, at 
its side which is towards the shutter carrier (7), the sealing strip (13) 

is of a width which corresponds to the slot aperture (12) in the closing 
plate portion (9).  

 
An extractor hood according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised 
in that the shutter carrier (7) is in the form of an integral shaped bar 

portion which extends through all grease separation cells (1). 
An extractor hood according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised 
in that the shutter carrier (7) is guided at the ends in respective guide 

rails. 
An extractor hood according to one of claims 1 to 7 characterised 
in that the shutter carrier (7) is connected to a chain pulling means 

(14) which passes over a chain wheel (15) and which with its free end 
projects through an opening in the closing plate portion (9) into the 

fume collection space (2) for displacement of the closure plates (8). 
An extractor hood according to one of claims 1 to 7 characterised 
in that the shutter carrier (7) is connected to an electromechanically 

displaceable rotary spindle. 
An extractor hood according to one of claims 1 to 7 characterised 
in that linear stroke motors (16) are provided for displacement of the 

shutter carrier (7). 
An extractor hood according to one of claims 1 to 7 characterised 
in that rotary motors (17) with an eccentric (18) are provided for 

displacement of the shutter carrier (7). 
An extractor hood according to one of claims 1 to 11 
characterised in that the grease filter (5) is formed by a cassette whose 

end which projects into the fume collection space (2) forms the suction 
intake opening (4) and at the side of which, that is opposite to the 

suction intake opening (4), there is provided an air outlet opening (19)  
 

which is open towards the air discharge duct (3), wherein disposed 
between the suction inta
ke opening (4) and the air outlet opening (19) 
are baffle plates (20) which engage tooth-like one into the other. 
An extractor hood according to claim 12 characterised in that 
the cassette comprises a bottom portion which is open at the top and 

which is otherwise sealed and which is closed by a cover fitted 
releasably thereon, wherein the baffle plates (20) are connected 

alternately to the bottom portion and to the cover in the direction of 
flow of the discharge air. 
An extractor hood according to claim 12 or claim 13 
characterised in that the baffle plates (20) are of a V-shaped 

configuration in cross-section, wherein the two legs of the baffle plates 
(20) which are arranged in the bottom portion are sealingly welded along 

their entire periphery to the bottom and to the side walls of the bottom 
portion respectively. 
An extractor hood according to one of claims 12 to 14 
characterised in that the end of the cassette which is provided with the 

suction intake opening (4) is of an angular configuration in cross-section, 
wherein the lower region which adjoins the bottom is closed and 

carries a gripping portion (21) for removal of the cassette while the 
upper region forms the suction intake opening (4). 
An extractor hood according to one of claims 1 to 15 
characterised in that provided both in the region at the front side and 

in the region at the rear side is a lighting strip which is formed by 
grease-tight lighting chambers (23) which are closed by safety glass (22) 

that is glued in position, fluorescent tubes (24) being arranged in the 
chambers (23).
