<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cyathane derivatives isolated 
from culture mycelia of Hericiumerinaceum which is a 
mushroom of the Hydnaceae family in the Hericium group. 
This invention further relates to production stimulators 
of nerve growth factors (hereinafter referred to as NGF) 
and antibacterial agents containing such cyathane 
derivatives. There have been reports on compounds isolated from 
mushrooms as well as their pharmacological effects. For 
example, it has been reported in Tetrahedron 39, 
2779-2785 (1983) that ergosterol derivatives isolated 
from Polyporus versicolor, which is a mushroom in the 
Polyporaceae family, have the effect of killing hepatoma 
cells. As another example, it has been reported in 
Phytochemistry 27, 2777-2789 (1988) that erogosterol 
derivatives isolated from Agaricus blazer, which is a 
mushroom in the Agaricaceae family, have the effect of 
killing hela cells. Similar effects have been reported 
also in Japanese Patent Publications Tokko 48-6766, 
55-71702 and 58-62118.  
 Regarding Hericiumerinaceum which is a mushroom in the 
Hydnaceae family, it has been reported in Japanese 
Patent Publications Tokkai 3-157347, 3-157367 and 
3-157379 that octadecenoic acid derivatives, 
isoindolinone derivatives and phthalide derivatives 
separated from this mushroom have the effects of killing 
hela cells. There have not been reports, however, on 
compounds isolated from culture mycelia of Hericium 
erinaceum. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
ascertain pharmacological effects of the compounds 
isolated from culture mycelia of Hericiumerinaceum. Another object of the invention is to provide production 
stimulators of nerve growth factors and antimicrobial 
agents containing such compounds. The present invention is based on the discovery made as 
a result of diligent studies by the present inventors on 
compounds isolated from culture mycelia of Hericium 
erinaceum, as well as their pharmacological effects, 
that new cyathane derivatives can be isolated by 
applying specified extraction and division processes on 
culture mycelia of Hericiumerinaceum and that such 
cyathane derivatives have the effect  
 
of stimulating production of nerve growth factors as 
well as antimicrobial effects. This invention relates to cyathane derivatives shown by 
Formulas (1) and (2) shown below, as well as NGF 
production stimulators and antimicrobial agents 
containing such cyathane derivatives as their effective 
component: 
 
where R is either CHO or CH2OH.

of water and a water-soluble organic solvent to obtain a 

water phase; 
subjecting said water phase to a liquid-liquid 
partition extraction process with water and a 

water-insoluble organic solvent to separate a 
water-insoluble organic solvent layer; and 
evaporating said water-insoluble organic solvent 
from said water-insoluble organic solvent layer to 

thereby obtain a dried solid object.

solutions of acetone. 
The method of claim 7 wherein said extracting 
step comprises steps of homogenizing said culture 

mycelia and said mixture, leaving the same for a 
specified length of time, obtaining a liquid extract by 

filtration, and heating the same under a reduced 
pressure condition for evaporation. 
The method of claim 7 wherein said 
water-insoluble organic solvent is selected from the 

group consisting of chloroform, ethyl acetate and 
diethylether. 
The method of claim 7 wherein said evaporating 
step comprises heating at 40-45°C under a reduced 

pressure condition.
