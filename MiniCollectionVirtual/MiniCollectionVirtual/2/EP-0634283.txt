<ABSTRACT>
A cast coated paper for ink jet recording is 
constituted to include, in lamination: a base paper, 

an undercoating layer comprising a pigment and an 
adhesive, and a cast-coating layer comprising a 

polymer having a glass transition point of at least 40 

o
C formed by polymerization of an ethylenically 
unsaturated monomer. The cast coated paper is 

preferably controlled to have an air of at most 300 
sec/100 cc. The undercoating preferably contains a 

cationic resin, particularly preferably a copolymer of 
a polyalkylenepolyamine and dicyandiamide. The cast 

coated paper thus produced with an excellent ink 
absorptivity suitable for ink jet recording while 

retaining a high surface gloss.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cast-coated 
paper for ink jet recording 
according to the preamble of claim 1. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to a cast coated 
paper having an excellent gloss in its as-produced 
state or before-printed state and particularly 
suitable for ink jet recording (printing), a process 
for producing the paper and an ink jet recording 
method using the paper. A cast coated paper and a process for its production comprising 
the features of the preambles of claims 1 and 9, respectively, are 
known from US-A-4 301 210 or US-A-4 265 969, which has the same 
disclosure as US-A-4 301 210. In recent years, ink jet recording as 
represented by recording by means of an ink jet 
printer, has been intensively used because of low 
noise characteristic, capability of high speed 
recording and facility of multi-color recording. Conventionally used ink jet recording papers 
have typically included high-quality or wood-free 
papers designed to have a high ink absorptivity and 
coated papers having surface coating of porous 
pigment. Such ink jet recording papers generally have 
a low surface gloss and have a feel of so-called mat paper. However, accompanying increasing demands on 
ink jet recording, such as higher speed recording,  
 
higher resolution of recorded image and full color 
image formation, there has been also desired an ink 
jet recording paper having a high surface gloss and 
excellent appearance. Known typical high-gloss papers include a high-gloss 
coated paper prepared by surface-coating with a plate-shaped 
pigment, followed by calendering, and a so-called 
cast coated paper prepared by pressing a wet-coated 
surface against a heated metal drum having a 
mirror-finished surface and drying the coated surface 
to copy a mirror-like surface of the drum. The cast coated paper is provided with a 
higher surface gloss and a better surface smoothness 
compared with an ordinary coated paper finished by 
super-calendering and shows excellent printing 
performances. For this reason, the cast coated paper 
has been generally used for providing high-class 
prints but is still accompanied with several 
difficulties. More specifically, a conventional cast coated 
paper has been prepared to have a high gloss by 
copying a mirror-finished drum surface of a cast-coater 
with a film-forming substance, such as an 
adhesive, included together with a pigment in the 
coating layer composition. On the other hand, the 
film-forming substance is liable to deprive the 
coating
