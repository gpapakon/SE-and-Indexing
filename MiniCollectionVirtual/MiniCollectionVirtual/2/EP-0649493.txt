<ABSTRACT>
A spring chamber isolation system is provided to isolate the spring chamber of a spring brake actuator from its operating environment. The brake actuator (14) comprises a service brake housing (18) divided into first and second service chambers (26, 28) by a diaphragm or piston, and a spring brake housing (20) arranged in tandem with and attached to the service brake housing, also divided into a first and second spring chambers (62, 63) by a diaphragm (52) or piston. A hollow actuator rod (56) is attached to the diaphragm or piston in the spring brake housing and extends from the first spring chamber, through openings in the spring and service brake housings, into the first service brake chamber. The actuator rod is open at both ends, allowing air to flow from the first service chamber into the first spring chamber when the volume of the first spring chamber increases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to fluid-operated brake
actuators for vehicles and more particularly to service
and spring brake actuators combined in tandem and
having a spring brake actuator rod.An air brake system for a vehicle such as a
bus, truck or the like typically includes a brake shoe
and drum assembly which is actuated by means of an
actuator assembly operated by the selective application
of a fluid such as compressed air. Conventional air
brake actuators have both a service brake actuator for
actuating the brakes under normal driving conditions by
the application of compressed air and an emergency or
spring brake actuator which causes actuation of the
brakes when air pressure has been released. The
emergency brake actuator includes a strong compression
spring which forces application of the brake when air
is released. This is often referred to as the spring
brake. Typically, the spring brake actuator is
disposed in tandem with the service brake actuator.The spring brake actuator is typically
divided into two chambers separated by a rubber
diaphragm and pressure plate, with the spring in one of
the chambers acting between and end wall of the spring
brake housing and the pressure plate. When full
pressure is applied to the opposite chamber, air
pressure acting against the diaphragm and pressure 
plate compresses the spring. In many applications, a
spring brake actuator rod is held in a retracted
position by a relatively small return spring. In newer
applications, the spring brake actuator rod is integral
with the pressure plate and held in a retracted
position by the air pressure.In both designs, the spring brake actuator
rod thus does not affect the normal operation of the
brake. The service chamber is typically divided into
two chambers by a diaphragm. Depressing the brake
pedal during normal driving operation introduces
compressed air into one of the chambers of the service
brake actuator which, acting against the diaphragm,
causes a service brake push rod in the opposite chamber
to be extended and the brakes to be applied with an
application force proportional to the air pressure in
the service brake actuator.In the event of a loss of air pressure or an
intentional exhaustion of air from the spring brake
actuator, the brake will be mechanically activated by
the force of the strong compression spring acting on
the spring brake actuator rod which, in turn, acts upon
the service brake push rod to apply the brakes. Thus,
the spring brake portion serves both as a parking brake
and an emergency brake.In
