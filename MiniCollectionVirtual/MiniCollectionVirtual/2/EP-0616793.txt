<ABSTRACT>
The instrument comprises an outer tube (1) fixed to the end of a flexible sheath (2), and an inner tube (3) which can be moved in the outer tube and is fitted with a head (5) to which a cylindrical mantle (7), having an internal boss (15), is fixed. Inside this mantle are arranged blades (10, 11) which are held axially on the outer tube by a ring (14) and can tilt on the outer tube, this tilting being provided by the cylindrical mantle (7) or, more precisely, by its end and by its internal boss (15) which acts like a cam. This instrument, which is particularly robust, is intended for removing deposits formed on the interior walls of arteries or of veins.

Medical instrument for the removal of deposits 
formed on the inner walls of the arteries or veins, 

comprising an outer tube (1) fixed to the end of a 
flexible sheath or tube (2) intended to be introduced 

into the artery or the vein, an inner tube (3) 
displaceable longitudinally in the outer tube, this 

inner tube being equipped, at its distal end, with a 
convex head (5) exhibiting an axial passage continuing 

the inner tube, expandable cutting and scraping means 
(10, 11) and means (7, 15) for ensuring the expansion 

and retraction of the cutting and scraping means under 
the effect of the relative longitudinal displacement of 

the two tubes, characterized by the fact that the 
convex head (5) is equipped with a cylindrical casing 

(7) surrounding the outer tube (1) and of an external 
diameter equal to the diameter of the head (5), that 

the outer tube (1) has, at its proximal end, a part (4) 
having a diameter at least approximately equal to the 

external diameter of the cylindrical casing (7), and at 
its distal end, means (8) for guiding the casing, that 

the cutting and scraping means are formed by at least 
two rigid blades (10, 11) substantially in the shape of 

a hyperboloid of revolution extending longitudinally 
along and around the outer tube, inside said casing, 

and bearing via their convex face on the outer tube, 
the ends of the blades being at least approximately in 

contact with the wall of the casing in the retracted 
position, and that the means for ensuring the expansion 

of the blades are formed by an inner boss (15) on the 
casing, having the function of a cam, the longitudinal 

displacement of which causes the blades to swivel on  
 

the outer tube (1), the retraction of the blades being 
effected by the end of the casing (7). 
Instrument according to claim 1, characterized by 
the fact that, in the retracted position of the blades, 

the end of the casing (7) comes into contact with the 
proximal end (4) of the outer tube, in such a way as to 

close the space delimited by the casing. 
Instrument according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
by the fact that the outer tube (1) is equipped 

with a means (14) for axial retention of the blades.
