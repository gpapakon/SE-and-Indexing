<ABSTRACT>
A sheet-framed IC carrier has a sheet frame having an
aperture, and a backing film with a pressure-sensitive

adhesive layer on one surface thereof which is stuck on the
back surface of the sheet frame. An IC carrier having an

IC module is secured in the aperture of sheet frame with
the adhesive layer on the backing film. When the IC

carrier is removed from the sheet-framed IC carrier, no
excessive load is exerted on the IC module and no projection

remains on the peripheral edge of the carrier base.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet-framed IC
carrier (IC carrier with sheet frame), in which a compact
IC carrier including a built-in IC module is incorporated
with a sheet frame, a method for producing the same, and an
IC carrier case.Figs. 47A and 47B are drawings to illustrate a conventional
IC carrier and a use thereof.An IC carrier 41 is constructed, as shown in Fig 47A,
in such a manner that an IC module 42 in which a CPU, a
memory, and electrodes are incorporated is mounted in a
compact base (in the size of about 15 mm x 25 mm), which
has been used, for example, as a subscriber identity module
(SIM) for portable telephone.Once a user obtains a subscriber identity module, which
is a right for subscription of telephone, he or she can
purchase a portable telephone 50 among those with common
specifications in accordance with his or her purpose and
the subscriber identity module (IC carrier 41) is set in
the portable telephone 50 purchased whereby he or she can
use it.The IC carrier 41, however, is not fully popular at
present, which limits applications thereof. Then preparation
of purpose-built facilities for mass production of
the IC carrier would cause an increase in production cost.
In the case of the above use as a subscriber identity
module, a carrier is enclosed in an envelope to be mailed,
which raised troublesome works of enclosing and sealing and
caused a trouble of braking or losing it because of erroneous
handling before mounting it into portable telephone 50.Under such circumstances there is a suggestion that IC
cards 40 are to be produced using existing facilities in 
such an arrangement, as shown in Fig. 47B, that taking-off
slits 44 are formed in card base 43 for IC card 40, leaving
a plurality of bridges 45, from which only IC carrier 41 is
taken off to be used.According to the suggestion, not only the existing card
production and inspection facilities but also conventional
IC card issue and sending systems can be used without
modification.With the conventional IC carrier 41 as described, a
load such as bend or torsion would be exerted on IC module
42 when removed from card base (sheet frame) 43, which
could cause destruction or popping-out of the IC module.Another problem was that a bridge 45 sometimes remained
on the side of IC carrier 41 in removing the module from
card base 43, which made the module hard to be inserted
into a mount portion in portable telephone 50. EP-A-0 535 436 an which the preamble of claim 1 is based, discloses a chip card manufacturing method for a
