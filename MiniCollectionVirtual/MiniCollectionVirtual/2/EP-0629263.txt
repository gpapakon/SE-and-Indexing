<CLAIMS>
A ceramic valve for internal combustion engines 
whose valve stem (2) is frictionally linked to a 

spring retainer (5) by means of a collet (3), the 
collet (3) having a conical outer profile, the 

spring retainer (5) having a corresponding conical 
bore and the spring retainer resting on the collet, 

wherein the valve stem (2) has an undisturbed 
cylindrical shape, i.e. has a constant circular 

cross section, in the region of the spring retainer 
(5) and is surrounded by the collet (3) with a 

corresponding cylindrical inner profile. 
The valve as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
conicity of the outer profile (4) of the collet (3) 

and of the bore (6) of the spring retainer (5) is 
from 0.5째 to 15째, in particular from 2째 to 6째.
