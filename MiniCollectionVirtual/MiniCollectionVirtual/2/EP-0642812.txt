<ABSTRACT>
A golf club head having a body (11) defining a heel

(15), and a front wall (17) defining an upwardly and 
rearwardly inclined front face (16), and comprising the 

body defining a forwardly extending main recess (21) 
located rearwardly of the front wall (17); and the body 

also defining an undercut recess (22) located directly 
rearwardly of the front wall (17) and extending outwardly 

from the main recess (21) toward one or more of the 
following 


i) the top wall (14) 
ii) the bottom wall (15) 
iii) the toe (13) 
iv) the heel 12;

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to golf clubs, 
and more particularly to golf club irons of improved 
construction to achieve advantages, such as audible sound 
attenuation, twist resistance, during impact with golf 
balls, and delayed momentum transfer to golf balls during 
stroking. In this regard, and in the past, irons evolved 
in design from flat back to hollow back structure, the 
present invention providing a further evolution in back 
structure to achieve virtual head enlargement effects, 
and attenuation of audible sound created during impact 
with a golf ball. Many efforts have been made to design iron 
heads to achieve higher energy availability for transfer 
to the golf ball when the ball is impacted by the head. 
However, no way was known, to our knowledge, to achieve 
delayed momentum transfer to the ball, over the very 
short time interval when the ball remains in contact with 
the head face, in the novel and unusual manner as 
achieved by the present invention; and no way was known 
to couple such delayed energy transfer with head twist 
resistance, in the manner to be described. Also, no way was known to attenuate audible 
sound created by impact with a golf ball by a front wall 
that has reduced peripheral rigidity due to weight  
 
displacement, as will be described. Embodiments of the invention variously 
provide an improved iron head construction meeting the 
need for delayed momentum transfer to the ball during 
club stroking and attenuation of 
audible vibration as well as club head increased twist 
resistance. Basically, the invention as embodied in a 
head metallic body, is constructed to define two 
intersecting recesses rearwardly of the head front wall, 
and bounded by head metallic extents Projecting 
rearwardly proximate peripheral regions of the head face 
defining front wall via web means adjacent the head front 
wall periphery. For example, the head may include: 
a) a body defining a forwardly extending main 
recess located rearwardly of the front wall, b) and the body also defining an undercut 
recess located directly rearwardly of the front wall and 
extending outwardly from the main recess toward at least 
one of the following: 
i) the top wall ii) the bottom wall iii) the toe iv) the heel, c) together with means on the front wall and 
located forwardly of the main recess for attenuating 
audible vibration created when a golf ball is struck by 
the front face. As will be seen, the attenuation means may 
include a thin plate, and adhesive material securing the 
plate
