<ABSTRACT>
A frequency stabilization method of a semiconductor laser 
is provided. A driving current, a forward voltage and an output 

light power of the laser mounted on a heat sink is detected. A 
temperature of the heat sink is also detected. A consumption 

power of the laser is obtained from the driving current and 
voltage thus detected, providing a relationship between the 

output light power and the consumption power. The driving 
current is controlled so that the output light power is kept 

constant, and the temperature of the heat sink is controlled 
based on the relationship so that a temperature of an active 

layer of the laser is maintained. The output light power is 
kept constant and at the same time, any temperature change of 

the active layer is cancelled through the temperature control 
of the heat sink. Even if the consumption power changes due to 

an leakage current and/or a recombination current without 
luminescence to maintain the output light power during long time 

operation, the temperature of the active layer is maintained by 
cancelling the consumption power change through the temperature 

control of the heat sink. Thus, the oscillation frequency of 
the semiconductor laser can be stabilized at a given value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor laser and 
more particularly, to a frequency stabilization method of a 
semiconductor laser and a frequency-stabilized light source. A conventional frequency stabilization method of a 
semiconductor laser is disclosed in the IEEE Journal of Quantum 
Electronics, Vol. 28, No. 1, Page 75, January 1992, in which an 
oscillation frequency of the laser is stabilized at an 
absorption line frequency of acetylene. Fig. 1 shows a 
functional block diagram of the conventional frequency 
stabilization method. In Fig. 1, the ambient temperature of a semiconductor laser 
701 is kept constant by a temperature controller 702. A DC 
power supply 709 supplies a driving current to the laser 701. 
The driving current is slightly modulated in frequency by a 
modulation signal outputted from an oscillator 703, resulting 
in frequency-modulated output light beams of the laser 701. One of the output light beams of the laser 701 is emitted  
 
from a side face of the laser 701 and used for a given 
application. The other of the output light beams of the laser 
701 is emitted from its opposite side face and goes through an 
optical lens system 708 to be injected into an acetylene (C2H2) 
gas cell 704. The light beam transmitted through the acetylene 
gas cell 704 is detected by a photodetector 705 to produce an 
electrical output signal. The electrical output signal is 
inputted into an lock-in amplifier 706 to be detected 
synchronously with the modulation frequency from the oscillator 
703. The lock-in amplifier 706 produces an electrical output 
signal proportional to a difference or error between the 
oscillation frequency of the laser 701 and one of absorption 
peak frequencies of acetylene in the cell 704. The electrical 
output signal from the amplifier 706 is fed-back to the driving 
current through a PID controller 707 in which a Proportional, 
Integral and Differential (PID) controlling method is employed. 
Thus, the laser 701 is controlled so that its oscillation 
frequency is kept to be in accordance with the absorption peak 
frequency of acetylene. Due to high stability in the absorption peak frequency, the 
oscillation frequency of the semiconductor laser 701 can be 
highly stabilized or locked. With the conventional frequency stabilization method shown  
 
in Fig. 1, to obtain the difference or error between the 
oscillation frequency and the absorption peak frequency, the gas 
cell 704 and the lock-in amplifier 706 are required, and the 
driving current is
