abnormality detecting circuit receiving the power supply voltage supplied 
to the subscriber instrument, for generating an active abnormality 

detection signal when the power supply voltage deviates from a 
predetermined voltage range. In response to the active abnormality 

detection signal, the monitor circuit is inhibited from outputting the 
monitor signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a subscriber circuit, and more 
specifically to a subscriber circuit having a function for monitoring 
operation of a subscriber instrument such as a telephone set. A subscriber circuit includes a monitor circuit for monitoring 
various operations of a subscriber instrument such as a telephone set. 
Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a circuit diagram of a typical 
example of a hook monitor circuit, which is one of monitor circuits and 
which first operates in the subscriber circuit when a subscriber makes a 
telephone call. The shown hook monitor circuit is generally designated with 
Reference Numeral 1A, and connected to a pair of subscriber lines "Tip" 
and "Ring" which are interconnected within a telephone set when a 
handset is lifted (off hook). The shown hook monitor circuit includes a 
resistor R₁₁ connected at its end to the subscriber line "Tip" and another 
resistor R₁₂ connected at its end to the subscriber line "Ring", an 
amplifier A₁ having an output connected to the other end of the resistor 
R₁₁, an amplifier A₂ having an output connected to the other end of the  
 
resistor R₁₂, and a power feeding controlling circuit 11 for detecting a 
level on each of the subscriber line "Tip" and the subscriber line "Ring", 
so as to supplying a predetermined level of power supply voltage to the 
subscriber telephone set through the amplifiers A₁ and A₂, the resistors 
R₁₁ and R₁₂ and the subscriber lines "Tip" and "Ring". The shown hook monitor circuit also includes an amplifier A₃ for 
detecting and amplifying a voltage across the resistor R₁₁, an amplifier 
A₄ for detecting and amplifying a voltage across the resistor R₁₂, an 
adder 12 for summing output voltages of the amplifiers A₃ and A₄, and a 
comparator 13A for comparing an output voltage of the adder 12 with a 
reference voltage Vr₁₁ and for generating an active hook monitor signal 
HS when the output voltage of the adder 12 becomes higher than the 
reference voltage Vr₁₁. The amplifiers A₁ to A₄ and the power feeding controlling circuit 
11 operate with a power supply voltage Vbb of - 48V, which is the same 
level as that of a voltage supply for supplying an electric power to the 
telephone set. However, the comparator 13A operates with a power 
supply voltage Vcc of +5V, which is the same as an operating power 
supply voltage for signal processing and controlling circuits (called 
"internal circuits" hereinafter) within the telephone set. Accordingly, the 
power supply voltage Vcc is different from,
