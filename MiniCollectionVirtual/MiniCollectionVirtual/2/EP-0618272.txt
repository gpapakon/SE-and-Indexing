The introduction of a curable 
organosilicone composition that affords a very 

releaseable, highly printable cured film that is 
strongly adhesive for such substrates as polyester film 

and so forth. 
Curable organosilicone composition that 
is composed of (A) polyorganosiloxane-grafted, 

aliphatically unsaturated polyester (B) 
organopolysiloxane that contains at least 3 silicon-bonded 

hydrogen atoms in each molecule, and (C) 
hydrosilylation-reaction catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
Curable organosilicone compositions that have 
good release properties are known in the art. For 
example, Japanese Patent Publication [Kokoku] Number 
Sho 47-23325 [23,325/1972] discloses a composition 
comprised of a of silanol-endblocked 
polydimethylsiloxane, an organopolysiloxane having at 
least 5 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in each molecule, 
and an organotin curing catalyst. In addition, U.S. 
Patent No. 4,332,844 discloses a composition comprised 
of a polydimethylsiloxane having silicon-bonded 
aliphatically unsaturated groups, an organopolysiloxane 
having at least 2 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in each 
molecule, and a platinum group metal catalyst. With 
each of these compositions, the film afforded by cure 
under specified conditions is highly releasing and is 
therefore used in a wide variety of industrial sectors 
as a release coating. However, these curable compositions suffer 
from various drawbacks in their applications as release 
coatings. These compositions are poorly adhesive for 
polyester film and polypropylene film substrates. A 
particular problem is that their cured films cannot be 
printed. As a consequence, adhesion by the cured film 
for the substrate has typically been improved by 
subjecting the film substrate to a plasma treatment 
prior to application of the curable composition. 
However, this procedure is economically disadvantageous 
because it requires an extra process in the form of the 
plasma treatment. Moreover, it does not solve the 
problem of poor printability, and it has been necessary 
to accept major limitations on both concept and design. It is an object of the present invention to 
solve the above problems by the introduction of a 
curable organosilicone composition that forms a highly  
 
releasing cured film that is strongly adhesive for such 
substrates as polyester film and that also has good 
printing properties. The present invention relates to a curable 
organosilicone composition that can be cured by briefly 
baking at low temperatures to give a highly releasing 
cured film that is strongly adhesive for such 
substrates as polyester film and that has good printing 
properties. The present invention is a curable 
organosilicone composition comprised of 
(A) a polyorganosiloxane-grafted, aliphatically unsaturated 
polyester obtainable by an addition reaction between 
an aliphatically unsaturated polyester resin and a polyorganosiloxane 
carrying silicon-bonded hydrogen only at a single 
terminal, wherein the carbinol end-groups have been blocked
