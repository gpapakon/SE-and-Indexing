<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the therapeutic treatment of hypertrophic scar tissue within a composition comprising a non-toxic transglutaminase inhibitor, such as putrescine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. A successful method for treating hypertrophic scar tissue with such compositions, is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions for wound therapy, and in particular for the
therapeutic treatment of hypertrophic scar tissue.Scar tissue is formed during healing of wounds, caused for example by burn,
traumatic injury and elective operative incisions. Often unpredictably, hypertrophy of the scar
tissue occurs. Hypertrophic scar formation is characterized by the accumulation of collagen
type III out of proportion to collagen type I.Current procedures and materials for wound treatment include the use of
compounds with potentially serious side effects, to highly invasive excisional procedures.According to another aspect of the invention,
the use of a non-toxic transglutaminase inhibitor which is having a free
amino group and is capable of selectively inhibiting type III procollagen
amino peptide (PIIP) crosslinking by transglutaminase, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable
acid addition salt thereof for the manufacture of a medicament
for the purpose of treating hypertrophic scar tissue in humans by
topical application of the medicament is provided.Transglutaminases are enzymes present in plasma and various tissues which
form isopeptide bonds between reactive glutaminyl groups and the e-amino group of lysine in
certain proteins. For example, type III procollagen has been shown to be a specific and avid
substrate for transglutaminase. During skin wound healing it appears that type III procollagen
amino peptide (PIIP) is cross-linked to other components of the wound matrix, such as fibrin
and fibronectin, by tissue transglutaminase. It is therefore hypothesized that if a
transglutaminase inhibitor having a free amino group is introduced to the wound site, its free
amino group will preferentially bind to the glutaminyl group, and thus inhibit the intended
protein substrate from cross-linking, forming an inert analog-amine adduct instead.Known non-toxic transglutaminase inhibitors of this type include  
aminoacetonitrile, (dansyl) cadaverine (1,5-diaminopentane), spermidine and putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane).
All of these compounds are non-toxic primary amines.More specifically, aminoacetonitrile is a primary aliphatic lower-alkyl (C1-5)
monoamine. Spermidine is a primary aliphatic aklylamine. Putrescine and (dansyl)
cadaverine are primary aliphatic lower-alkyl (C1-5) polyamines. Other similar, non-toxic
primary amines of these types are also contemplated.It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the active compounds may
be usefully applied in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable
