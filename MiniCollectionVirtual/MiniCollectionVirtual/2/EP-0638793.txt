<ABSTRACT>
In a method for leak testing gas pipes and gas appliances by measuring the leakage gas quantity occurring within a testing interval, using a flow measuring device, a pressure container of variable volume and - in the case of a gas pipe test - the gas supply line in line connection therewith and to be tested being filled with a testing gas and the pressure container being held, during the testing process, at a predetermined, essentially constant pressure, reverse testing takes place in a simple manner by connecting the pressure container whose volume can be varied with its input line and, via the flow measuring device, with its output line to the gas meter and, after filling the gas supply line and the pressure container, the leakage quantity measurement is undertaken whilst maintaining the testing gas volume in the variable-volume pressure container constant.

Method for the leak testing of gas pipes and gas appliances by measuring
the leaked gas quantity occurring within a testing interval with the aid of

a flowmeter, in which a variable volume pressure vessel and, in the case of
gas pipe testing, the gas supply line to be tested and in line connection

therewith, are filled with a test gas and during the testing process the
pressure vessel is kept under a preset, substantially constant pressure,

characterized in that the variable volume pressure vessel (9), for filling
with a test gas, is connected by means of a line to a gas appliance (1)

or to the gas pipe to be tested or to a separate test gas container, is
filled with gas from the supply line or with test gas from the test gas

container and, in the case of filling from the test gas container, is subsequently
connected to a gas appliance (1) or to the pipe to be tested and

in the case of gas appliance testing, following the turning off of the

gas appliance (1), particularly at the appliance stopcock (7) or, in the
case of pipe testing, after shutting off the pipe, particularly at the

pipe stopcock (6), a line connection is brought about between the variable
volume pressure vessel (9) and the gas appliance (1) or the gas pipe by

means of the flowmeter (11) and the test gas in the variable volume pressure
vessel (9) is subject to the action of a preset testing pressure, which is

kept constant over a testing interval, so that the leak quantity is measured
in the rearward direction of the gas supply line.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the variable volume
pressure vessel (9) is filled by means of an entry pipe (15) with the test

gas, which is located between the variable volume pressure vessel (9) and
the gas appliance (1) or gas supply pipe (3).
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the appliance
stopcock (7) is closed after filling the variable volume pressure vessel (9)

and independently of the gas supply line (3) only the leak at the gas
appliance (1) is measured by means of the gas flow quantity.
Method according to claims 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that leak testing
takes place at a pressure corresponding to the operating conditions.
Means for performing the method according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
with a variable volume pressure vessel, which is subdivided by a highly

elastic membrane into a compressed air part which can be supplied by means
of a pump with compressed air and a gas container part with an entry pipe

and an exit pipe and a flowmeter, characterized in that the entry pipe (15)
and exit pipe (14) are connected to a three-way shutoff device (16), whose

third way is connectable to a test connecting piece (13) in the gas appliance
(1) or with a corresponding connecting piece of the gas supply line.
Means according to claim 5, characterized in that the variable volume
compressed air vessel (9), the flowmeter formed by a flow sensor (11) and a

flow quantity display (11a) and a pressure meter comprising a pressure
sensor and a pressure display (12a) constitutes a leak measuring device in

the form of an appliance unit housed in a casing having regulating devices
for the zero setting of the pressure and the adjusting of a constant test

gas pressure during the measuring process, as well as an inlet and an outlet
for connection to the three-way shutoff device (16).
Means according to claim 6, characterized in that the three-way shutoff
device (16) is also integrated into the appliance unit and is connectable by

means of a connecting line to the test connecting piece (13) of the gas
appliance (1) or to a corresponding connecting piece of the gas supply line

(3).
Means according to one of the claims 5 to 7, characterized by a digital,
stepwise display as a result of different coloured light emitting diodes

of the measured gas flow quantity.
