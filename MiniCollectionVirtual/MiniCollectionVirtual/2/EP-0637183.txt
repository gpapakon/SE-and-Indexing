<ABSTRACT>
A network adapter (10) and wiring scheme makes use of existing
plain old telephone service (POTS) wiring to provide support between

analogue devices within the subscriber premise and an Integrated Digital
Service Network (ISDN). Moreover, the network adapter and wiring scheme

provides further support between digital devices within the premise and
the ISDN while concurrently supporting analogue devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to communication systems and more particularly to telephone systems which utilize existing plain old telephone service (POTS) wiring in providing both analogue and digital telephone service within a subscriber premise.This invention relates generally to integrated services digital networks (ISDN), and particularly to accommodating analogue and digital equipment over existing wiring in a subscriber premise (office, house, etc.) having a single line ISDN subscription.ISDN is defined by internationally accepted standard digital network user interfaces. The resulting network offers a variety of subscriber access lines capable of supporting services including voice, data, facsimile, and video. There are two CCITT (International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee) recommended standard integrated services digital network interfaces for user access. They include the basic rate interface (BRI) and a primary rate interface (PRI). By integrating these various services on a single transport system means, the subscriber avoids buying multiple services to meet multiple service needs. As a practical consideration a single transport system requires less overhead than providing a discrete access line for each service, and results in a total lower cost of service.An ISDN Basic Rate interface (BRI) consists of three channels, referred to as two B channels plus a D channel (2B + D), in which all signals flowing over the external TELCO lines are carried in a baseband digital form and in a standardized frame format. With this arrangement, the B channels are the basic user channels which carry digital voice, high-speed data, and other functions at a maximum channel rate of 64 kbps. The D channel bit rate in this interface is 16 kbps and may serve two purposes. First, the D channel carries control signalling information to control circuit-switched calls on associated B channels at the user interface. In addition, the D channel may be used for packet switching or low speed telemetry when not carrying signalling information. Accordingly, an ISDN Primary Rate Interface (PRI) consists of multiple B channels and one 64 kbps D channel having primary rates of either 1544 kbps (23 B + D) and 2048 kbps (30 B + D).The BRI may be arranged to provide simultaneous voice and data services in several ways giving users flexibility in configuring their services. A user may use each B channel for voice service, for circuit switched data transport, or for packet switched data services. The D channel can carry
