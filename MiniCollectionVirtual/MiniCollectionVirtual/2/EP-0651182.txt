<ABSTRACT>
In a method for controlling a manipulated variable which determines the difference in rotating speed of a clutch, a phase with a manipulated-variable characteristic determined by a time function can be supplied during a nonsteady-state coupling state. The beginning and end of this phase are determined by one or two vehicle-specific influencing variables, one of which is determined by the actuation of the accelerator pedal and the other is determined by the temperature of the clutch.

Arrangement for controlling a regulating variable
which determines the rotational speed difference

of a clutch (10) located in the force path between an
internal combustion engine (8) and a change-speed

gearbox (9) of a motor vehicle, having an electronic
control unit (43) which processes input signals (27,

28, 45, 46, 47, 48) dependent on influencing variables
specific to the vehicle together with fixed required

value characteristics and which emits required values
in the form of output signals for action on an

actuation element adjusting the regulating variable,
having a device for recording an influencing variable

(28) dependent on the speed of the accelerator pedal
(26) , it being possible during a transient clutch

condition to select a phase with a variation,
determined by a specified time function, of the

regulating variable and the beginning and the end of
both the transient clutch condition and the phase being

respectively fixed as a function of influencing
variables specific to the vehicle, characterized in

that the arrangement comprises a device for recording
an influencing variable (27) dependent on the

temperature of the clutch, in that a device is used for
recording an influencing variable (27) dependent on the

rate of change (dT/dt) of the temperature (T) of the
clutch (10) and in that one or both influencing

variables (27 and 28) - of which one depends on the
rate of change (dT/dt) of the temperature (T) of the

clutch (10) and the other depends on the speed (ds/dt)
of the accelerator pedal (26) - is or are used both to 

fix, exclusively, the beginning and end of the phase
(15 to 25) and, additionally, to fix the curve (34,

34a; 35, 35a; 36, 36b; 37, 37b; 38 to 40), determined
by a specified time function, of the regulating

variable (p42).
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the end of a phase (19 or 21) with a curve (36

or 37) determined by a specified time function is fixed
by that instant (t8 or t11) at which the accelerator

pedal speed (ds/dt) reaches a lower scalar limiting
value and in that a follow-up phase (20 or 22) with a

curve (36b or 37b), determined by a specified time
function, of the regulating variable can be selected at

this instant if the accelerator pedal speed (ds/dt) in
the phase (19 or 21) located before this instant (t8 or

t11) had exceeded a predetermined upper scalar limiting
value.
Arrangement according to Claim 2, characterized
in that a curve (36b or 37b), determined by a specified

time function, in a follow-up phase (20 or 22) depends
on the accelerator pedal speed (ds/dt).
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the influencing variables fixing

the transient clutch conditions (11 to 14) include the
load change between driving operation and overrun

operation.
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the influencing variables fixing

the transient clutch conditions (11 to 14) include a
characteristic diagram (Fig. 3), dependent on engine

operating parameters, for the change in the clutch conditions
(11 to 14).
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the influencing variables fixing

the transient clutch conditions (11 to 14) include
changes in the transmission ratio of the change-speed

gearbox (9).
