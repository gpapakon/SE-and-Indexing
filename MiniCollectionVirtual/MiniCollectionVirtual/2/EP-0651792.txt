<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel cellobiose oxidase,
an enzymatic agent comprising the cellobiose oxidase and a
process of bleaching paper pulp using the cellobiose oxidase.Chemical pulping (known as Kraft pulping) of wood chips for
paper production involves alkaline sulphate cooking of the
wood chips to remove 90-98% of the lignin present in the
wood. The remaining 2-10% lignin imparts a dark brown colour
to the pulp which tends to darken in UV light or by
oxidation. To obtain a white pulp, the lignin present in the
pulp must therefore be removed by a variety of bleaching
procedures, most of which involve treatment with chlorine or
chlorine dioxide, ozone, oxygen or hydrogen peroxide.Due to an increasing concern about the environmental impact
of the chemicals generated in the bleaching process,
enzymatic treatment of the pulp has been proposed with a view
to removing lignin from paper pulp while reducing the amount
of bleaching chemicals needed in the process, vide e.g. "The
third International Conference on Biotechnology in the Pulp
and Paper industry", Stockholm, 16-19 June, 1986, pp. 67-69.The enzymatic treatment of paper pulp hitherto described has
mostly been carried out at an acid pH with hemicellulases
with an acid pH optimum, vide e.g. "4th International
Symposium of Wood and Pulping Chemistry", Paris, 22-30 April,
1987, Vol. 1, pp. 151-154, or with a fungal preparation from
Trichoderma, cf. M.G. Paice and L. Jurasek, J. Wood Chem.
Technol. 4, 1989, pp. 187-198; or D.J. Senior et al.,
Biotechnol. Lett.10, 1988, pp. 907-912, requiring a pH
adjustment of the wood pulp to below a pH of 6. Xylanase compositions are also used in the pulp and paper
industry in the pulp bleaching process to enhance the
brightness of bleached pulps, decrease the amount of
chemicals used for bleaching as well as in the bleaching of
recycled paper, cf. K.E.L. Eriksson, Wood Science and
Technology24, 1990, pp. 79-101, M.G. Paice et al.,
Biotechnol. and Bioeng.32, 1988, pp. 235-239, J.C. Pommier
et al., Tappi Journal, 1989, pp. 187-191. The use of an
alkaline xylanase for pulp treatment is described in WO
91/02839.In wood, lignin is linked to xylan. Xylanase is capable of
catalysing the hydrolysis of the xylan so that an increased
release of lignin occurs during bleaching. Another enzyme,
cellobiose oxidase, has been found to be important for lignin
degradation in that it reduces phenoxy radicals and quinones
formed by the action of phenol oxidases on degradation
products from lignin, thereby oxidising cellobiose
