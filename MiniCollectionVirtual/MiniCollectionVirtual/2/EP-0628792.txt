A system for measuring the frequency of oscillation 
of a fluid within a fluidic oscillator comprising 

detector means (1, 2) for detecting fluid oscillations, 
providing a signal representing the oscillations, the 

detector means having a peak detector (3) comprising a 
threshold device (13) receiving a first signal 

corresponding to the signal representing the 
oscillations, the threshold device being in a conductive 

state when the voltage applied thereto exceeds a 
threshold value, the device then providing a second 

signal with a drop in potential relative to the first 
signal, means (14) for receiving and storing the second 

signal, and comparison means (15) comparing the value of 
the second, stored signal with the value of the first 

signal and providing an output signal characteristic of 
the relative values of the first and second signals, 

characterized in that the peak detector further comprises 
an amplifier (30) which receives and amplifies the signal 

provided by the detector means and which provides the 
first signal to the threshold device, the gain of the 

amplifier being controlled by the second signal received 
from the threshold device. 
A system according to claim 1, wherein the threshold 
device (13) is in a conductive state when the voltage 

which is applied thereto exceeds a negative or a positive 
threshold value. 
A system according to claim 2, wherein the threshold 
device (13) comprises two diodes (20, 21) connected back 

to back. 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the storing means (14) comprise a capacitor.  

 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein the amplifier (30) is a differential amplifier, 

one of the two inputs of the amplifier receiving the 
signal provided by the detector means and the other input 

receiving a signal dependent on the second, stored signal 
and on the output of the amplifier, the output of the 

amplifier providing the first signal and being connected 
to the threshold device. 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein an impedance matching device (33) with unity gain 

is located between the amplifier (30) and the means (14) 
for storing the second signal. 
A system according to claim 6, wherein the impedance 
matching device (33) with unity gain is a tracking 

circuit. 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
wherein the comparison means (15) comprise an amplifier 

which receives the first and second signals at two of its 
inputs, in order to compare them.
