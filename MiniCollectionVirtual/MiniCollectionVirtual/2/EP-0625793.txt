<ABSTRACT>
A fluorescent lamp produces light having colour 
coordinates within an ellipse (A) about 22 standard 

deviation of colour matching around the colour 
coordinates (B) x = 0.344 y = 0.302. The luminescent 

layer of the lamp comprises a mixture of: magnesium 
fluorogermanate activated by manganese as red emitter; 

calcium halophosphate as white emitter; and a blue 
emitter preferably strontium pyrophosphate activated by 

divalent tin. The layer may alternatively be a mixture 
of red emitting magnesium fluorogermanate and blue 

emitting barium titanium pyrophosphate. Other blue 
emitters are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluorescent lamp,
and in particular, to a fluorescent lamp for use in
aquaria.Aquaria, particularly the relatively small type for
household use, are commonly lit with fluorescent lamps.
Former types of fluorescent lamp which have been used,
whilst imparting a not unattractive reddish colour to
orangy objects such as goldfish, suffers from the
disadvantage that, a reddish cast is imparted to almost
all colours so that the many varieties of fish now
popular for small aquaria do not show up to best
advantage. Also there is distortion of green.
Furthermore, such types of lamp have the disadvantage of
low lumen output, poor lumen maintenance and large colour
drift with a affecting colour rendering.EP-A-0364124 discloses a fluorescent lamp for use in
aquaria, the luminescent layer in said lamp comprising a
mixture of red, green and blue phosphors, the red
phosphor emitting predominantly in the spectral region of
from 610 nm to 620 nm, the green phosphor emitting
predominantly in the spectral region of from 540 nm to
545 nm and the blue phosphor having a peak emission
wavelength between 430 nm and 480 nm with the half peak
width not exceeding 80 nm, said red, green and blue
phosphors being blended to form said mixture in such 
proportions that the colour co-ordinates of the lamp
employing said mixture on the CIE chromaticity diagram
differ from the point x equals 0.300 and y equals 0.232
in any direction by no more than 10 standard deviations
of colour matching (SDCM). Most preferably, the lamp of
EP-A-0364124 has the colour co-ordinates x equals 0.300
and y equals 0.232.Individual red, green and blue phosphors which may
be used to form the above mixture are well known in the
art and according to EP-A-364124 suitable such phosphors
include the following:-Yttrium and/or gadolinium oxides activated by
trivalent europium and having the following formula:
(YaGd1-a)2O3:Eu3+
In the preferred case a is 1, i.e. the phosphor is:-
Y2O3:Eu3+Cerium and terbium activated aluminates, silicates,
phosphates and borates selected from compounds of the
following formulae:-
CeMg Al11O19:TbY2SiO5:Ce,TbLaPO4:Ce,TbLaMgB5O10:Ce,TbParticularly suitable are:
CeMgAl11O19:Tb and LaPO4:Ce,TbAlkaline earth hexagonal aluminates of the B-alumina
structure, or alkaline earth chlorophosphates, each
activated by divalent europium and having the following
formulae:-
BaMgAl10O17:Eu2+BaMg1.7Al20O32.7:Eu2+ BaMg2Al24O39:Eu2+ (Sr,Ca,Ba)10Cl2(PO4)6:Eu2+ Such a lamp avoids the problems of the former types
