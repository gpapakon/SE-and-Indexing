<ABSTRACT>
The binocular eye lens for microscopes comprises an objective (10) arranged in each of the two beam paths, an eyepiece (14) and a path-folding system (11 to 13), the eyepieces (14) forming a converging angle (2 delta ) seen in the viewing direction of the two beam paths and being pivotably arranged. The path-folding system has a mirror surface (12) which, during pivoting of the eyepiece (14), is copivoted through half of the angle through which the eyepiece is pivoted, the optical axes of the eyepieces (14) forming a converging angle (2 delta ) seen in the viewing direction of the two beam paths. The image rotation is compensated by rotating the inverting prisms.

<CLAIMS>
Binocular attachment for microscopes and other optical
instruments with an objective (10) disposed in each of

the two optical paths in a first housing (16), a pair
of deflection means (11), a rotating mirror (12) and

one optical path reversing system (13) each rotably
mounted in a second housing (17) for the interpupillary

adjustment and an eyepiece (14) with a field stop (15),
wherein the eyepieces with the housing (17) supporting

the same are disposed so as to be swingable about an
axis proceeding vertically to the plane of symmetry

and through the reflecting mirror surface (12) in the
first housing (16) and in which the mirror (12), when

the eyepieces (14) are swung horizontally, is swung
along by half of the angle through which the eyepieces

are swung,

characterized in that

the optical axes of the eyepieces (14), seen in the
direction of view of the two optical paths, form a

fixed convergent angle 2δ, in which case the convergence
2δ of the optical paths is produced by the rotation

of the deflection means (11) about the optical
axes of the objectives (10) through, in each case,

an angle γ = δ/sin β, with β = angle of deflection on
the deflection means, with the consequence that an

image rotation through the angle α according to the
approximate relationship α ≈ 2·γ·β/180° is produced,

in that the beam reversing systems (13) are
in each case comprised of a prism system for the

image erection, whose prisms are rotated relative to
each other in such a way in each case through an angle

δ/2 so that the image rotation is in each case compensated
by half (α/2). 
Binocular attachment according to Claim 1,

characterized in that

the deflection means (11) is a pair of prisms or a
pair of mirrors.
Binocular attachment according to Claims 1 and 2,

characterized in that

the image erection is effected with the aid of Porro
prisms of the second type.
Binocular attachment according to Claims 1,2 and 3,

characterized in that

the angles of deflection (β2 and β3) leading to the
compensation of the image rotation diverging from 90°

are produced in the Porro prisms (13) by means of altered
prism angles.
