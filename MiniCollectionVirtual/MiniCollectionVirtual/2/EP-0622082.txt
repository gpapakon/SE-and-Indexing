<ABSTRACT>
An immunocomplex which does not cleave 
in vivo
, is stable, and retains a potent drug effect. The complex comprises an 
antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof and an abrin A chain, each of which is bound to a cross-linking agent which 

does not cleave 
in vivo
 through a thio ether bond.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an immunoconjugate 
effective for treating cancers; heart diseases and 
circulatory diseases; immune diseases and allergies; 
infectious diseases and the like. In addition to in vitro diagnostics, the use of 
monoclonal antibodies as in vivo diagnostics and in vivo 
therapeutic agents are now intensively studied. Thus, 
development of pharmaceuticals employing monoclonal 
antibodies are now intensively proceeded in the fields of 
therapies of tumors; heart and circulatory diseases; 
immune diseases and allergies; infectious diseases and 
the like. Particularly, diagnostics and therapeutic 
agents using monoclonal antibodies which specifically 
bind to tumor cells are now especially intensively 
studied and developed. Therapeutic methods for treating cancers employing 
monoclonal antibodies include the methods in which an 
antibody alone is administered so as to gather 
macrophages and lymphocytes having receptors for Fc 
region of antibodies around the tumor region, thereby 
attacking the cancer; and the target therapeutic methods 
in which an immunoconjugate is used, that comprises a 
monoclonal antibody to which a toxic substance such as a  
 
cytotoxic protein including ribosome-inactivating 
proteins (hereinafter referred to as "RIP" for short) and 
some types of enzymes; a radioisotope (RI); an anti-cancer 
agent or the like is bound. Among the latter target therapeutic methods, 
immunotoxin conjugates are especially intensively 
studied, and therapy of cancers by using conjugates 
having a tumor-specific monoclonal antibody and ricin A 
chain which is a plant toxin or a Pseudomonas exotoxin is 
now studied. Although it is most important that the 
immunotoxin conjugates have a low toxicity to the body 
and yet have an effective pharmacological effect, the 
stability of the administered drug in the blood is also 
important. For example, antibody-ricin A chain conjugate 
is mainly prepared by cross-linking the antibody and 
ricin A chain via N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridylthio)propionate 
(SPDP), and it is said that the 
disulfide bond (S-S bond) formed by the linker SPDP is 
indispensable for exhibiting strong pharmacological 
effect. However, the S-S bond has a drawback that it is 
attacked by another thiol compound in the blood and is 
easily cleaved. In order to overcome this problem, 
Thorpe et al developed a new linker 4-succinimidyloxycarbonyl-α-methyl-α-(2-pyridyldithio)toluene (SMPT) in which the S-S bond is 
sterically hindered by methyl group in the side chain.
