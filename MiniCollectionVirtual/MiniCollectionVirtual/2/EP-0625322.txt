<ABSTRACT>
Bed comprising a frame with at least two side parts, between which there is provided a space for the lying area of constant size. To be able to cover the space with the lying area when the bed is not in use and then use the bed as a conventional divan, provision is made on that side of each side part 1 of the frame which faces the lying area for in each case one guide 4, in which a cover 3 for the lying area, which cover extends from side part 1 to side part 1, is displaceably guided.

<CLAIMS>
A bed comprising a frame having at least two side parts, between which a space is provided
for a cover designed as a portative lying surface extending from side part (1) to side part (1),

wherein on the side facing the lying surface, of each side part (1) of the frame a guide (4) is
each provided, which departs from the head-side end of the lying surface and, on the foot-side

end of the lying surface, passes into a guiding part leading back to the head-side end of the
lying surface, in an arcuate manner such that the lying surface is displaceable from a position

closing the interior of the bed into an opened position starting from the head-side end of the
same while being deflectable towards the bottom of the bed on the foot-side end, wherein the

cover is comprised of a plurality of lamellas (3) connected with one another so as to be
movable about axes oriented perpendicular to the direction of displacement of the cover, which

lamellas are provided with a tapestry or upholstery and, on the side facing away from the lying
surface, comprise webs (3') extending along the lamellas (3) while reinforcing the same.
A bed according to claim 1, characterized in that the lamellas (3) are made of metal and the
webs (3') are designed as integrally formed T sections.
A bed according to claim 2, characterized in that the webs (3'), on their two longitudinal
ends, comprise rollers (8) or ball bearings guided in guides of the side parts (1) of the frame,

which are designed as grooves (4).
A bed according to claim 1, characterized in that the cover is movable by an actuator
including an electromotor (9) equipped with a spindle (10), which is provided with a screw

thread and rotatably mounted on its ends and on which a nut (12) connected with at least one
lamella (3) in a rotationally fast manner is provided.
A bed according to claim 2, characterized in that the cover is movable by an actuator
including an electromotor (9) provided with at least one toothed wheel engaging directly in the

webs (3') integrally formed with the lamellas (3).
A bed according to claim 2, characterized in that the cover is movable by an actuator
including an electromotor (9) comprising a cable pull moved by the same and connected with

at least one of the lamellas (3).
A bed according to claim 3, characterized in that the grooves (4) are lined with epoxy resin. 
A bed according to claim 1, characterized in that the lamellas (3) are designed as thicker
partial sections of a one-piece plate, between which thinner sections of the plate are provided

to flexibly connect the thicker partial sections of the plate forming the lamellas (3).
