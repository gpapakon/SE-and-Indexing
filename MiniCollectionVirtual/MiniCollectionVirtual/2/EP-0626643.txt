<ABSTRACT>
A processor includes logic circuitry (30) for producing output 
signals in response to input signal states from other circuitry (31), such input 

signal states subject to signal delays resulting from environmental conditions. 
The processor includes a wait state circuit (36) connected to the logic circuitry 

(30) for delaying operation of the logic circuitry (30) in response to the input 
signal states for a time period, the time period set in accordance with a worst 

case propagation delay of signals that give rise to the input states. A delay 
circuit (38) is responsive to environmental conditions for providing a delay 

indication if signal delays that result from the environmental conditions are less 
than a predetermined value. Further circuitry (40) is responsive to the delay 

indication to disable the wait state circuitry (36) so that the logic circuitry (30) 
operates in a more rapid manner. In one embodiment, the delay circuit (38) 

comprises a chain of circuits which feeds an edge triggered flip flop (40). In 
another embodiment, the delay circuit comprises a ring oscillator (70) whose 

output is compared with a known frequency (76) as a measure of signal 
propagation speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a processor whose processing speed is
dependent upon environmental conditions, and more particularly, to a processor
that enables or disables a wait state in a processing action if an environmental
condition exceeds a preestablished limit.It is known that environmental conditions, i.e., temperature, power
supply variations, process variables that occur during fabrication of processor
components, etc., can cause substantial variations in the functioning of a
processor. Designers assume "worst case" environmental conditions and often
add "wait states" into a procedure to assure that all signals required for proper
operation of logic circuits are present when the logic circuits are "fired". Once
such a wait state is built into a procedure, it will always slow down the
procedure, whether the environmental conditions are "worst case" or not.State machines often have built-in wait states. In Fig. 1, a block
diagram of a state machine 10 is shown whose output 12 is connected to a
combinational logic element 14. The output of combinational logic element 14
is fed via line 16 back to state machine 10. Other inputs are fed via line 18, to
state machine 10. State machine 10 is designed to only provide an output on
line 12 when its inputs have reached their required logical states and are stable.
The time required to attain such signal stability is dependent upon, among other
things, the propagation delay of signals through combinational logic element 14.
Those propagation delays are variable based upon environmental conditions. In
order to assure that the outputs appearing on line 16 are stable under worst
case conditions, a wait state assures that internal logical circuitry only responds
to input logic state conditions after a delay that considers the worst case
condition. In Fig. 2, a diagram illustrates how state machine 10 will operate
in the case of both typical signal delays and worst case delays. Given a typical
delay, a signal sample point can be established whenever input setup signals 20
have reached a stable state. However, since state machine 10 is designed to
accommodate worst case delays, signal sample point 21 is delayed in time to
assure that input signals 22 are sensed only after they have stabilized. As a
result, (see state diagram of Fig. 3) a wait state 24 is programmed into state
machine 10 to delay the sample time. Such a delay is then always present,
even if the environmental conditions are not such as to make the delay a
requirement. WO92/10032 relates to a
