<ABSTRACT>
The support structure according to the invention is a modular system which makes it possible to make support assemblies (EM) for all sorts of ships, both monohull and multihull, and also makes it possible to displace the ships with these assemblies. It comprises a plurality of identical modules (1). Each is an elongate bearing structure, the base of which can be provided with means which make possible its displacement on a plane surface, and the top of which comprises means for positioning and fixing blocks at any points of the length. It also comprises means of connection between modules making it possible to fix together a number of modules at a distance from one another and also making it possible to fix them end to end.

A blocking system characterised in that it comprises a plurality of modules 1 at least nearly 
identical, each module 1 being an extended bearing structure the base of which can be fitted 

with means allowing its displacement on a flat surface, and the top of which comprises the 
means to position and attach keel blocks at any points lengthwise, and in that, moreover, it 

comprises the connecting means between the modules, making it possible to bring together 
several modules separated from each other, and making it possible also to attach them end to 

end. 
A blocking system according to Claim 1, characterised in that the top of module 1 
comprises a longitudinal central corridor delimited by two angle plates 25 for receiving and 

fixing keel blocks (26, 32) at any point lengthwise. 
A blocking system according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the bottom of module 1 
forms housings that receive water or air buffers (24) intended to ensure the position stability 

of the modules above the ground and the formation of a sliding fluid layer for their 
displacement. 
A blocking system according to Claim 3, characterised in that the principal body or case 10, 
of modules 1 is mounted on square plates 19 the bottom of which delimits the said housings 

for buffers 24 with two crosspieces 21 under two opposite sides of the said housings, plates 
(19) being fixed to be movable under case 10 bottom to allow a longitudinal or transverse 

orientation of crosspieces 21. 
A blocking system according to any of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that it comprises 
identical side keel blocks 32, comprising a supporting plane 34 the inclination of which can be 

adjusted. 
A blocking system according to Claim 
5, characterised in that supporting plane 34 is covered by a flexible envelope 35 forming a 

buffer when put under pneumatic or hydraulic pressure. 
A blocking system according to any of Claim 5 or 6, characterised in that raising devices 32 
are provided for side keel blocks. 
A blocking system according to any of Claim 1 to 7, characterised in that the said 
connecting means between modules 1 comprise lugs 28 at their extremities, by which they can 

be bolted end to end, as well as bars 40 to allow modules 1, separated from each other to be 
connected, bars 40 being fixed to lugs 28, through connecting pieces 41. 
A device according to Claim 8, characterised in that connecting pieces 41 are rings fixed on 
lugs 28, in which bars 40 pass, and are slide blocked, by means of clamping collars 42. 
A device according to any of Claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the case has a trapezoidal 
section and is fitted with a basic plate 11 and a top plate 12 which are linked by a meshing of 

transverse walls 13 and longitudinal walls 14.
