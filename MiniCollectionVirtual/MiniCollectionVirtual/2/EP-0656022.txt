<DESCRIPTION>
 Polymer ProductsThis invention relates to polymer compositions and more particularly to compositions for use in the manufacture of transparent or reflective articles.The use of polymer films for improving the light transmission through or from transparent or reflective articles is known. For example, in U.S. Patent No. 4844983 there is described a glass or plastics substrate which in use is susceptible to misting which has on at least one surface an antimist coating of a hydrophilic polyurethane which when hydrated contains from 35 to 60% by weight water and which has a thickness of 3 μm to 50 μ. . Whilst such coatings have good antimist properties, they are not very scratch or abrasion resistant. Moreover, the hyάropnilic polyurethanes have to be employed as coatings since they are not amenable to fabrication as free-standing structures such as films or sheets.In US-A-4800122 there are described scratch resistant coatings for peroxide curaole polyurethane elastomers which comprise a polyfunctionai monomer having three or more acrvloioxv groups per molecule and at least one N-vinyl imido group containing monomer. The coatinσs are ror eά bv first coatinσ the inside of 

the mold for the polyurethane with the acryioloxy-N-vinyl/i ido group containing monomers, curing the in-mold coating, casting the urethane composition into tne mold and curing the urethane.The surface characteristics of products formed by this process are stated to include scratch resistance. However, such coatings do not confer antimist properties to the surface.The invention seeks to provide a polymer composition which not only has the good antimist properties of the known hydrophilic polyurethane materials but also has good scratch and abrasion resistance and is capable of being formed into free standing structures sucn as films or sheets as well as being useful for coating substrates such as those of glass or plastic material.The present invention therefore provides a composition of matter naving antifog properties comprising a hydrophilic polyurethane in admixture with a compatible polymer.By the term 'compatible' is meant that the polymers will co-exist with the polyurethane component without anv ohase seDaration when the oolvurethane and 

polymer components are admixed. Suitably such polyurethane polymer mixtures will exhibit good light transmitting properties.The compatible polymers may be homopoly ers or copolymers or mixtures of such polymers. Aptly such polymers are derived from monomers or oligomers having ethylenic
