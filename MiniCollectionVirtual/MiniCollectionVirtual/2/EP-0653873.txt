<ABSTRACT>
A simultaneous voice and data modem performs "voice-activated" data 
rate changes to improve the transmission quality of the voice signal. In particular, 

when the simultaneous voice and data modem detects that a local telephone set has 
gone "off-hook," the simultaneous voice and data modem selects a signal space with 

a lower symbol density, which, although resulting in fewer bits per symbol, provides 
for a higher quality voice transmission.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to data communications equipment and, 
more particularly, to the detection of a voice signal in a simultaneous voice and data 
communications system. The co-pending, commonly assigned, U.S. Patent application of Gordon 
Bremer and Kenneth D. Ko entitled "Simultaneous Analog and Digital 
Communication," serial No. 08/076505, filed on June 14, 1993, describes a 
simultaneous voice and data communications system in which a voice signal is 
added to a data signal for transmission over a communications channel to a receiving 
modem. In this simultaneous analog and digital communication system, the data 
signal to be transmitted is represented by a sequence of data symbols, where each 
data symbol is associated with a particular N-dimensional signal point value taken 
from a signal space. Similarly, the analog signal, which is represented by a voice 
signal, is processed so that it is mapped into the N-dimensional signal space to 
provide a voice signal point. This voice signal point defines the magnitude and angle 
of a voice signal vector about the origin of the signal space. The data symbol and 
the voice signal vector are then added together to select a resultant N-dimensional 
signal point, which is then transmitted to a far-end modem. Upon reception of the transmitted N-dimensional signal point, the 
receiver of the far-end modem detects the embedded data symbol and subtracts the 
data symbol from the received N-dimensional signal point to yield the voice signal 
vector. This voice signal vector is then used to recreate the voice signal. Using this above-mentioned technique to simultaneously transmit voice 
and data, the quality of the voice signal is affected by the underlying data rate as 
described in the co-pending, commonly assigned, U.S. Patent application of Gordon 
Bremer, Kenneth D. Ko, and Luke J. Smithwick, entitled "Shaped Signal Spaces in a 
Simultaneous Voice and Data System," serial No. 08/076530, filed on June 14, 1993. 
Generally speaking, when transmitting data plus voice the higher the data rate - the 
lower the quality of voice transmission. This is because at a higher transmission 
rate, the data symbols are closer together, which results in a lower dynamic range for 
the voice signal. Therefore, when transmitting a voice signal, it is preferable to 
reduce the number of symbols in the data signal space in order to increase the 
allowable dynamic range of the voice signal - which concomitantly improves the  
 
quality of the voice transmission. A

<CLAIMS>
A method for changing a data rate of a simultaneous voice and data 
modem, the method comprising the steps of: 

   transmitting a data signal at a first data rate; and 
   changing from the first data rate to a second data rate in response to 

detecting a voice signal; 
   where the second data rate is less than the first data rate. 
The method of claim 1 further comprising the step of transmitting to a 
far-end modem side-channel information representing whether the voice signal has 

been detected. 
The method of claim 1 further comprising the step of transmitting to a 
far-end modem a retraining signal representing whether the voice signal has been 

detected. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the step of changing includes the step 
of detecting an off-hook signal. 
The method of claim 4 wherein the off-hook signal is provided by a 
telephone set coupled to the simultaneous voice and data modem. 
Apparatus for changing a data rate comprising the steps of: 
   means for transmitting a data signal at a first data rate, where the data 

signal is represented by a stream of data symbols selected from a first signal space, 
the data symbols having k bits per symbol; 

   means for detecting an off-hook signal; and 
   means for selecting a second signal space wherein the data symbols 

have j bits per symbol and j
<
k, wherein the data signal is now represented by a 
stream of data symbols selected from the second signal space. 
The apparatus of claim 6 further including: 
   means for encoding a voice signal to provide a stream of signal points 

subsequent to the detection of the off-hook signal; and
 

   means for adding the stream of signal points to the stream of data 
symbols selected from the second signal space to provide a stream of data plus voice 

signal points; 
   wherein the means for transmitting now transmits the data plus voice 

signal points.
