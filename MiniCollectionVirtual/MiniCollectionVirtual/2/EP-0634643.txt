<ABSTRACT>
A spectrographic multipass sample cell for the analysis of trace 
impurities in sample gases is provided with a gas 

inlet (12), a gas outlet and a volume for confining the sample 
gases for analysis. Two mirrors are provided, a first mirror (18) 

proximate the gas inlet the second mirror (20) proximate the gas 
outlet, the first mirror having a hole (19) at its radial center. 

A conically-shaped cell profile is further provided such that 
the formation of vortices of sample gas is prevented in the 

cell upstream of or in the region where the analysis of trace 
impurities is to take place.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention deals with a spectroscopic sample
cell for the analysis of trace impurities in sample gases.
The present cell design is particularly applicable for the
diode laser absorption spectroscopy detection of trace levels
of water and other impurities commonly found in high purity
gases.Spectroscopy is commonly used as a tool for analyzing
impurities in gases. Significant problems persist, however,
when the impurity of interest interacts with the surface of
the sampling system and of the cell which is generally used to
contain the sample during analysis. An impurity which absorbs
on or reacts with the surface may appear lower in
concentration than it really is. Alternatively, if the system
has previously been exposed to the same impurity so that the
impurity is reversibly bound to sampling cell surfaces, then
the system may contribute impurity to the gases being analyzed
so that the same may appear higher in concentration than that
actually contained in the sample under investigation.The detection of trace amounts of water in ultra high
purity gases is particularly difficult. Background signals
appear through moisture release from surfaces of the system.
Moisture also tends to react with other components, and to
adhere to surfaces. System considerations include spurious
effects caused by cell wall absorption-desorption, atmospheric
interference.Many commercial applications require specialty gas such
as semiconductor nitrogen gas to have certified water levels
below 10 ppb. Small of amounts of impurities in such process 
gases have been shown to drastically effect both the yield of
final products, especially when used in severe conditions
including high temperature operations.Accurate measurement techniques have been somewhat
enhanced by taking precautions considered standard in trace
moisture analysis, such as the use of high quality
electropolished stainless steel for constructing the gas
handling system while avoiding materials known to contribute
large amounts of water vapor, such as certain polymers. In
addition, the sample cell can be heated to remove absorbed
water and by maintaining the cell at elevated temperatures,
the speed of absorption/desorption processes can be increased
and equilibrium reached more rapidly and with less sample gas
being consumed. This procedure is somewhat inconvenient,
however, and has never been demonstrated to be sufficient to
reach trace moisture levels in the realm of 10 ppb.As noted in an article entitled Multipass Absorption Cell
