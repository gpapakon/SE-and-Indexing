<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to radiographic intensifying
screens for converting image-wise modulated X-radiation into
ultraviolet and/or blue radiation. More specifically this
invention is related to lithium tantalate phosphors for use in
a radiographic intensifying screen.X-ray excited phosphors are well known for their use in
medical radiography. Medical X-ray films are typically
sensitive to UV, blue or green light and therefore the
X-radiation containing the diagnostic information must be
converted to lower energy to optimally expose the film. This
conversion is done by an intensifying screen comprising an
appropriate phosphor as the principal active ingredient.Phosphors which are suitable for converting X-ray
energy to the appropriate lower energy are well known. The
specific desirable properties include: high conversion
efficiency, low granularity and a low quantity of afterglow
emission. Particularly useful are phosphors for use in x-ray
intensifying screens which have an emission in the near UV
and blue. The most widely known phosphor for this purpose
is CaWO4 which has become the industry standard. There is
an ongoing desire in the art to provide UV or blue emitting
medical x-ray intensifying screens which have a higher speed
than intensifying screens comprising CaWO4.Zegarski teaches a lithium tantalate and lithium niobate
phosphor in U.S. Patent 5,064,729. However, this compound
results from the reaction of lithium oxide with an oxide of 
sulfur. The lithium tantalate formed from this reaction is
known to be LiTaO3 or LiNbO3 each of which is different from
the phosphors of the present invention both in terms of
reactivity and chemical composition.It is an object of the present invention to provide an
x-ray intensifying screen for use in radiographic elements.The present invention provides an x-ray intensifying screen
comprising a support and at least one active layer coated on said
support; wherein said active layer comprises a binder and a
phosphor corresponding to the formula
Li3Ta1-xNbxO4
wherein x is 0.002 to 0.10.A further embodiment of the invention,
the x-ray intensifying screen of the present invention is used
in combination with a suitable film. Thus, the present invention also provides a
radiographic recording element comprising at least one x-ray
intensifying screen in operative association with a
photosensitive film element wherein said x-ray intensifying
screen comprises; a support; at least one active layer coated
on said support and said active layer comprises a phosphor
correspondin
