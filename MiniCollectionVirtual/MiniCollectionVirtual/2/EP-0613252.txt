<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a crystal
oscillator, and more particularly to a temperature
compensated crystal oscillator used as a reference
frequency oscillator in a mobile communication device
(such as a car telephone, a portable telephone, and a
cordless telephone), a satellite communication device,
and the like.In recent years, there has been increasing
demand for a crystal oscillator used for oscillating a
reference frequency in a mobile communication device
(such as a car telephone, a portable telephone, and a
cordless telephone, and often called a cellular telephone),
a satellite communication device, and the like,
as such communication devices have been become more and
more prevalent.A crystal oscillator to be used for oscillating
a reference frequency is required to have as small
fluctuation of the oscillating frequency as possible
against changes of temperature. In the case of use in
a terminal for an analog portable telephone system used
in North America, for example, the fluctuation of the
oscillating frequency is required to be within a range
of ±2.5 p.p.m. over a temperature range of -30°C to
+75°C. For use in a terminal for a narrow-band TDMA
type digital portable telephone system, the fluctuation
of the oscillating frequency is required to be within a
range of ±1.5 p.p.m. over a temperature range of -20°C 
to +85°C. For use in a terminal for a large capacity
analog portable telephone system used in Japan, the
fluctuation of the oscillating frequency is required to
be within a range of ±1.0 p.p.m. over a temperature
range of -20°C to +85°C. Moreover, such crystal oscillators
used in a portable telephone must satisfy other
requirements, e.g. miniaturization of the device and
reduction of the manufacturing cost, which are particularly
eminent requirements for a crystal oscillator
used in a cellar telephone. Therefore, a crystal
oscillator suitable for such use is strongly needed.The oscillating frequency-temperature characteristics
of a crystal oscillator depend directly on
the resonant frequency-temperature characteristics of a
quartz crystal resonator used in the crystal oscillator.
Therefore, when the oscillating frequency is
required to be highly stable over a wide temperature
range, a temperature compensation circuit is usually
required. There are two known methods for temperature
compensation using a temperature compensation circuit.
One is an analog temperature compensation method in
which change in the impedance of the quartz crystal
resonator is compensated by using a
