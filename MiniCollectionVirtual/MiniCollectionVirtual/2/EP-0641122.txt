<ABSTRACT>
A receiver includes a kinescope (22), a driver amplifier (24) 
and an integrated automatic kinescope bias (AKB) circuit (42). A 

soft start circuit (72) includes a timing capacitor (84), external to 
the integrated circuit, and a control circuit (46) within the 

integrated circuit which limits the AKB current adjustment range 
during turn-on to a time determined by the external capacitor. 

The capacitor (84) is effectively isolated from the integrated 
circuit to prevent discharge thereof by protection diodes of the IC 

whereby the time constant of the overall AKB circuit is 
substantially the same for both hot start conditions and cold start 

conditions thereby avoiding undesirable visual start-up artifacts 
such as black level and contrast shifts during warm-up of the 

kinescope for either a cold start condition or a hot start condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an automatic kinescope bias (AKB)
arrangement for use in a television system such as a television
receiver or video monitor.Television receivers and monitors sometimes employ an
automatic kinescope bias (hereafter, AKB) control system for
automatically establishing proper black image representative current
levels for each electron gun of the kinescope. As a result of this
operation, pictures reproduced by the kinescope are prevented from
being adversely affected by variations of kinescope operating
parameters which may be caused, for example, by component aging
or by component sensitivity to changes in temperature.A conventional AKB control system includes a current sampling
resistor in a kinescope cathode driver amplifier which is coupled to a
control amplifier in an AKB feedback control loop for automatically
adjusting the kinescope black level. Generally, this is done by
sampling the kinescope drive level during a retrace interval,
comparing the sample with a reference level and applying a
correction current to the driver amplifier in a sense to adjust the
black level to a desired reference value.The present invention resides, in part, in the discovery that in
certain circumstances it may be desirable to defeat or partially
defeat the AKB operation. As an example, when a television receiver
or monitor is first turned on the AKB system may tend to accentuate
the kinescope drive current. Under such a "cold start" condition it
would be desirable to defeat or partially defeat the AKB system until
the kinescope cathodes reach their proper operating temperature.For the "cold start" condition, one might consider the addition
of a timing circuit to the AKB circuit to delay or otherwise modify the
AKB operation for a fixed time period after the application of power 
to the television receiver or monitor. Such a technique is described in US-A-4 450 476. It has been found, however,
that the delay which is needed during a "cold start" condition is
undesirable during a "hot start" condition. As used herein a "hot
start" condition is one in which a receiver or monitor, which has
been operating for a period of time, is rapidly switched off and back
on. Without correction for this condition, the AKB system may bias
the kinescope at an undesirable level creating a so-called "hot flash"
of kinescope brightness. For this case it would be desirable that the
AKB simply "ignore" the rapid power cycling and not make any
adjustments to the kinescope bias current. An even more desirable
