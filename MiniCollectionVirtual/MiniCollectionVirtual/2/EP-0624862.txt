<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a driving
circuit for a display apparatus. More particularly,
the present invention relates to a driving circuit for
an active matrix type liquid crystal display apparatus
which displays an image with multiple gray scales in
accordance with digital video signals.An active matrix type liquid crystal display
apparatus includes a display panel and a driving circuit
for driving the display panel. The display panel
includes a pair of glass substrates and a liquid crystal
layer formed between the pair of glass substrates.
On one of the pair of glass substrates, a plurality of
gate lines and a plurality of data lines are formed.
The driving circuit is disposed for every pixel in the
display panel, and the driving circuit applies a driving
voltage to the liquid crystal of the display panel.
The driving circuit includes a gate driver for individually
selecting one of a plurality of switching elements
connected to the gate lines and the data lines,
and a data driver for supplying a video signal corresponding
to an image to pixel electrodes via the selected
switching element.Figure 11 shows a configuration of a part of
a data driver in a prior art driving circuit. The
circuit 110 shown in Figure 11 outputs a video signal
to one of a plurality of data lines. Accordingly, the
data driver requires circuits 110 the number of which 
is equal to the number of data lines provided in a
display panel. For simplicity of explanation, it is
herein assumed that video data consists of three bits
(D0, D1, D2). On such an assumption, the video data
may have eight values of 0 to 7, and a signal voltage
supplied to each pixel is one of eight levels V0-V7.The circuit 110 includes a sampling flip-flop
MSMP, a holding flip-flop MH, a decoder DEC, and analog
switches ASW0-ASW7. To each of the analog switches
ASW0-ASW7, a corresponding one of external source
voltages V0-V7 of respective eight levels which are
different from each other is supplied. In addition, to
the analog switches ASW0-ASW7, control signals S0-S7
are supplied from the decoder DEC, respectively. Each
of the control signals S0-S7 is used for switching the
ON/OFF state of the respective analog switch.Next, the operation of the circuit 110 is
described. At the rising of a sampling pulse TSMPn
corresponding to the nth pixel, the sampling flip-flop
MSMP gets video data (D0, D1, D2), and holds the video
data therein. When such video data sampling for one
horizontal period is completed, an output pulse signal
OE is applied to the holding
