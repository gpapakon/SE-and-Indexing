<ABSTRACT>
A keyboard musical instrument produces electronic 
sounds in synchronism with fingering on a keyboard (3), and 

a player can select an reverberation emvironment and a 
depth of reverberation through predetermined keys 

(f#2/g#2/a#2; f2/g2/a2/b2) of the keyboard before the 
performance, thereby making an arrangement on a switch 

board (4) simpler.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electronic keyboard
musical instrument and, more particularly, to an electronic
keyboard musical instrument having a multifunctional
keyboard available for not only a performance but also
control thereof.While a player is fingering on a keyboard of the
electronic keyboard musical instrument, the electronic
musical instrument electronically produces musical tones,
and allows the player to perform a music score. Thus, the
keyboard is used for designating the musical tones in a
performance.The electronic keyboard musical instrument is
progressively being developed, and another function is
assigned to the keyboard. The keyboard of an electronic
keyboard instrument is available for a transposition. If a
player depresses one of the keys respectively assigned the
notes C1 to C5 and, then, manipulates the power switch, the
electronic keyboard instrument reassigns the notes to the
respective keys, and the player performs a transposed music 
without changing the fingering.The keyboard of another electronic keyboard musical
instrument is available for selection of a music in an
automatic player mode. The electronic keyboard musical
instrument have stored various music scores, and
selectively reproduces the musics in the automatic player
mode without fingering on the keyboard. The stored music
scores are tied to predetermined keys of the keyboard.
When a person wants to enjoy one of the musics in the
automatic player mode, he or she depresses one of the
predetermined keys and, then, powers the electronic
keyboard musical instrument. The electronic keyboard
musical instrument starts to reproduce the selected music.However, the additional function of the keyboard only
achieves a single purpose, and other purposes requires an
additional switches. According to EP-A-0 437 289, there is provided, in an electronic musical
instrument, a selection switch for selecting musical information determining
characteristics of a tone such as a tone color. This selection switch is pre-assigned
with first musical information. Switches and circuits are provided for assigning
second musical information to the selection switch. This second musical
information is one selected as desired from among plural musical information.
Thus, at least two musical information of the pre-assigned first musical information
and the selectively assigned second musical information are assigned to the
selection switch. When a first mode has been selected by this mode selection
switch, a characteristic of a tone to be produced is
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A keyboard musical instrument having at least a
standard playing mode for producing electronic sounds and a

setting mode for selecting at least two parameters for said
electronic sounds, comprising:


a) a keyboard (3; 31a) having a plurality of keys
(3a/3b; 31g) selectively depressed by a player, said

plurality of keys having first keys (f#2/g#2/a#2; f1/a1/b1)
and second keys (f2/ g2/ a2/ b2; f#1/ g#1/ a#1); and
b) an electronic sound producing system (2; 32)
detecting keys depressed by said player in said standard

playing mode for producing said electronic sounds,
c) an entry means (4/2e/KF/2a/P1/Q2 /Q3) for causing
said keyboard musical instrument to enter into said setting

mode;
d) a first selecting means (2d/ 2a/ Q4/ Q5/ R3/ R4) for
discriminating at least one depressed first key from said

first keys in said setting mode for selecting a first
parameter for said electronic sounds;
e) a second selecting means (2d/ 2a/ Q4/ Q5/ R1/ R2)
for discriminating at least one depressed second key from

said second keys in said setting mode for selecting a second
parameter for said electronic sounds; 
f) an exit means (2a/ KF/ S6/ Q3) for causing said
keyboard musical instrument to recover from said setting

mode to said standard playing mode; and
g) a modifying means ( 2h/ 2a/ S2/ S4) responsive to
said first and second parameter selections for modifying said

electronic sounds in said standard playing mode.
The electronic keyboard musical instrument as set
forth in claim 1, in which at least two attributes of

reverberation are selected through said first parameter and
said second parameter.
The electronic keyboard music instrument as set forth
in claim 2, in which said at least two attributes are a

reverberation environment and a depth of reverberation.
The electronic keyboard music instrument as set forth
in claim 1, in which said entry means (4/2e/KF/2a/P1/Q2/Q3)

causes said electronic keyboard musical instrument to
enter into said setting mode when a power switch is turned on

while depressing at least one of said first keys (f#2/ g#2/a#2)
and said second keys (f2/ g2/ a2/ b2).
The electronic keyboard music instrument as set forth
in claim 4, in which said exit means (2a/ KF/ S6/ Q3)

changes said electronic keyboard musical instrument to said
standard playing mode after one of a completion of said 

first and second parameter selections and a power-on without
depressing said first keys (f#2/g#2/a#2) and said second

keys (f2/g2/a2/b2).
The electronic keyboard music instrument as set forth
in claim 1, further comprising


h) an acoustic piano (31) having said keyboard (31a), a
plurality of key action mechanisms (31b) linked with said

plurality of keys (31g), a plurality of hammer assemblies
(31c) driven by said plurality of key action mechanisms

(31b), respectively and a plurality sets of music wires
(31d) each struck by one of said plurality of hammer

assemblies for producing an acoustic sound when the
associated key (31g) is depressed, and
i) a controlling system (33) having a stopper (33c)
changed between a free position and a blocking position

changed by said player, said hammer assemblies (31c)
rebounding on said stopper in said blocking position before

striking the associated sets of music wires (31d), said
stopper in said blocking position allowing said hammer

assemblies (31c) to strike the associated sets of music
wires (31d).
