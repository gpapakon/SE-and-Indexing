<ABSTRACT>
A transducer assembly (10) for an ultrasonic liquid level 
measuring device utilizing a piezoelectric crystal (81) 

for generating ultrasonic pulses to be transmitted through 
a volume of liquid. The assembly (10) includes an 

enclosure for the piezoelectric crystal assembly (80), 
that defines an interior space and a sealed opening for a 

cable (30). The enclosure (20) is provided with a 
metallic layer that shields the entire interior space from 

electromagnetic interference. The assembly also includes 
a crystal housing assembly (60) and a terminal block (40) 

all located within the sealed enclosure (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The U.S. Government has a paid-up license in this invention
and the right in limited circumstances to require the patent
owner to license others on reasonable terms as provided for by
the terms of Contract No. F33657-91-C-0006 awarded by Air Force
Systems Command.The invention relates to a transducer assembly for an
ultrasonic liquid level measuring device, the transducer assembly
including means for generating ultrasonic pulses to be
transmitted through a volume of liquid, a power cable for
supplying current to the means, a housing for the means, a
terminal block secured to the means housing and having terminals
thereon for connection to the power cable, the terminals being
electrically connected to the means, and an enclosure.A known transducer assembly of this type is disclosed in GB-A-2265219.
This assembly is attached to and directs ultrasonic
pulses along a stillwell or tube as is well known in the art.One problem with this type of known assembly is that of
eliminating the effects of electromagnetic interference (EMI)
that could adversely effect the measurements obtained by the
assembly.Still another problem is that of securing the enclosure that
contains the ultrasonic pulse generating means to the body of the
stillwell at the desired location with the ultrasonic pulse
generating means positioned correctly at the end of the tube so
as to direct the ultrasonic pulse along the axis of the
stillwell.In accordance with the invention therefore, the transducer
assembly first set forth above is characterised in that the means
is a piezoelectric crystal, in that the enclosure has an opening 
through which the power cable extends and has interior walls with
a metallic layer formed thereon to block electromagnetic
interference, and in that the enclosure includes a main housing
member and a cover adapted to be tightly secured to the main
housing member after the crystal housing and the terminal block
have been positioned in the main housing member.The transducer enclosure of the present invention reduces
the problems described above and affords other features and
advantages heretofore not obtainable.

assembly embodying the invention mounted in association with a
stillwell for measuring the fuel level in an aircraft fuel
tank and with parts broken away and shown in section;Fig. 2 is a side elevation taken from the line 2-2 of

<CLAIMS>
A transducer assembly (10) for an ultrasonic liquid level
measuring device, the transducer assembly including means (81)

for generating ultrasonic pulses to be transmitted through a
volume of liquid, a power cable (30) for supplying current to the

means (81), a housing (60) for the means (81), a terminal block
(40) secured to the means housing (60) and having terminals

(47,48) thereon for connection to the power cable (30), the
terminals being electrically connected to the means (81), and an

enclosure (20), characterised in that the means is a
piezoelectric crystal (81), in that the enclosure (20) has an

opening (28,29) through which the power cable (30) extends and
has interior walls with a metallic layer formed thereon to block

electromagnetic interference, and in that the enclosure (20)
includes a main housing member (21) and a cover (22) adapted to

be tightly secured to the main housing member (21) after the
crystal housing (60) and the terminal block (40) have been

positioned in the main housing member.
A transducer assembly as defined in claim 1, characterised
by means (31) providing a seal between the power cable (30) and

the edges of the opening (28,29).
A transducer assembly as defined in claim 2, characterised
in that the sealing means comprises a tubular ferrule (31) formed

of electrically conductive material and having a portion thereof
bonded to the metallic layer.
A transducer assembly as defined in claim 1, characterised
in that the enclosure (20) includes means (23,24) for attaching 

the assembly (10) to a stillwell (11).
A transducer assembly as defined in claim 4, characterised
in that the attaching means comprises a pair of flexible

resilient arms (23,24) extending outwardly from the enclosure
(20) and adapted to flex ou
twardly during attachment and to move
into a holding position to surround and grip the stillwell (11)

therebetween.
A transducer assembly as defined in claim 1, characterised
in that the main housing member (21) has an outwardly extending portion

(26) at one end that is adapted to contain the crystal housing
(60), the extending portion being adapted to be positioned at the

bottom end of a stillwell (11) whereby the crystal (81) is
oriented to direct ultrasonic pulses along the stillwell axis.
A transducer assembly as defined in claim 1, characterised
in that the piezoelectric crystal (81) is assembled in

combination with a window element (82) and a back plate (83), the
window element having an acoustic impedance with efficient energy

transfer characteristics and the back plate being adapted to
isolate the crystal from undesired acoustic echoes.
A transducer assembly as defined in claim 7, characterised
in that the crystal (81) is secured between the window element

(82) and the back plate (83) by adhesive bonding, the
circumferential portions of the window element (82) and the back

plate (83) extending radially outward beyond the circumference
of the crystal (81) and being in engagement with one another at

an angled joint to minimize stresses in the crystal due to
differential thermal expansion.
