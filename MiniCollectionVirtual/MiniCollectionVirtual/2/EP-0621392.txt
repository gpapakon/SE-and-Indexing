<ABSTRACT>
An automatic tensioning and locking device for fabric and/or 
netting roller blinds and mosquito-curtains, to be associated with 

a roller box endpiece provided with a support pin (16) for a winding 
roller in which a return spring (18) and a drive bush (19) for said 

roller 
interact between said roller and said support pin (16), about said 

drive bush (19) there being wound a spiral spring (18) the ends of which 
alternately abut against a cam unit which is rotatable coaxially 

with the drive bush and carries a pin (26) which interacts with an 
elastically loaded stop element rockable at least between a 

position in which said fabric and/or netting can freely unwind, a 
position in which unwinding/rewinding are prevented with stoppage 

of said pin, and a position in which said fabric and/or netting 
can be wound.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an automatic tensioning and locking 
device for roller blinds and mosquito-curtains. In the various types of known roller blinds and mosquito-curtains 
various devices have been proposed for laterally guiding the 
fabric or netting in such a manner as not to allow even small 
apertures to be formed. Devices have also been applied to blinds 
and/or mosquito-curtains for tensioning the fabric or netting when 
completely unrolled to cover the corresponding window or opening. 
One of these known devices consists of a combination of mutually 
rotating parts installed in proximity to and/or on the support 
shaft for the fabric and/or netting winding roller. These parts 
are arranged at the required distance and in the required position 
on mounting the roller box on the window such as to determine a 
fixed limited extent of unwinding of the fabric and/or netting 
from the roller equal to the height of the window. The tensioning 
of the fabric and/or netting when in its maximum unwound position 
is determined by the upper locking of the fabric and/or netting by 
said device, which prevents rotation of the roller, and the lower 
locking by hooking elements acting on a bar situated at the free  
 
end of the fabric and/or netting and also acting as a gripping 
handle. This device for adjusting the unwinding height of the fabric 
and/or netting therefore requires complicated setting-up during 
installation or mounting of the blind or mosquito-curtain, which 
is not always within the capacity of the final user. A further problem of this known device is that both the roller 
support pins have to be used for its construction. In this 
respect, the first pin is surrounded by the spring for the return 
or rewinding of the fabric and/or netting, and the second pin 
supports and houses the device for adjusting the unwinding height 
of the fabric and/or netting. This arrangement of elements on 
both pins also results in complications during mounting and 
installation. An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a 
device for tensioning unwound roller blinds and mosquito-curtains 
which does not require any setting by the installer of the blind 
or mosquito-curtain. A further object is to enable this device to tension and lock the 
fabric and/or netting independently of the height of the window or 
opening to which it is applied. These objects are attained according to the present invention by 
an automatic tensioning and locking device for fabric and/or 
netting roller blinds and

<CLAIMS>
An automatic tensioning and locking device for fabric 
and/or netting roller blinds (14) and mosquito-curtains, to be 

associated with a roller box endpiece (17) provided with a support pin (16) 
for a winding roller in which a return spring (18) and a drive bush (20) for 

said roller interact between said roller and said support pin, 
characterised in that about said drive bush (20) there is wound a 

spiral spring (23) the ends of which alternately abut against a cam 
unit which is rotatable coaxially with the drive bush (20) and carries 

a pin (26) which interacts with an elastically loaded stop element (27) 
rockable at least between a position in which said fabric and/or 

netting can freely unwind, a position in which unwinding/rewinding 
are prevented with stoppage of said pin (26), and a position in which 

said fabric and/or netting can be wound. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said 
cam unit consists of two elements coaxial with said drive bush, 

which interact with said spiral spring (23) and said stop element (27). 
A device as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that a 
first of said two elements comprises a cylindrical portion (30) rigid 

with and projecting from a flange portion (31) of greater diameter, 
said cylindrical portion (30) being provided with a pair of 

diametrically opposing radial notches (32,33) one of which is larger than 
the other, and into which the ends (24,25) of said spiral spring are 

inserted in a freely rockable manner. 
A device as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that a 
second of said two elements (29) comprises a cylindrical portion (34) 

provided with a radially outward projecting cam portion (35) on which  
 

said pin (26) is provided, in an inner wall of the cylindrical portion 
there being provided arch-shaped recesses (36,37) arranged to house the 

ends of said spiral spring (24,25) in a freely rockable manner. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said 
spiral spring (23) is seated on a cylindrical end portion of said drive 

bush (20) which is housed coaxial with said cam unit. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said 
endpiece (17) is in the form of a flat box having an open major side, 

and an outwardly facing closed major side from which there extends 
said support pin (16) and on which there is provided an inwardly 

projecting abutment tooth (39) arranged to engage a perimetral recess (40) 
in an element of the cam unit, on said open side facing the roller 

there being located a plate (41) which supports said stop element (27). 
A device as claimed in claim 6 , characterised in that said 
plate (41) is centrally perforated to house a flange-shaped plate (43) 

provided on said drive bush (20) in an intermediate region thereof. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said 
endpiece (17) is box-like and is closed by a plate (41) to which said stop 

element (27), in the form of a hook element, is constrained, said 
constraint being achieved by a fixing eyelet (44) into which an end 

appendix (45) of said hook element is inserted. 
A device as claimed in claim 8, characterised in that said 
hook element is of C-shape, a base of which is constrained to said 

plate (41) by said appendix (45), on the open side of said C there being 
provided on one free end (47) an inner abutment surface (46) for said pin, 

on the other free end of said C there being provided an outer 
slide surface for said pin.  

 
A device as claimed in claim 8, characterised in that to 
said hook element (27) there is constrained one end of a further 

spring (49), the other end of which is rigid with said plate (41), said 
further spring maintaining said hook element rotated towards the 

axis (48) of said device. 
A device as claimed in claim 8, characterised in that an 
intermediate part of said hook element carries on its inside a 

deviator element (50) arranged to enable said pin (26) to escape from said 
hook element.
