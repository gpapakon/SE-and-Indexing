<ABSTRACT>
A diamond semiconductor device of the present 
invention comprises an n-type diamond layer to which an 

n-type dopant is doped at high concentration so that 
metal conduction dominates, a p-type diamond layer to 

which a p-type dopant is doped at high concentration so 
that metal conduction dominates, and a high resistance 

diamond layer formed between the n-type diamond layer and 
the p-type diamond layer. Here, the thickness and the 

doping concentration of the high resistance diamond layer 
are values at which semiconductor conduction dominates. 

Then, in a case that an applied voltage is forward bias, 
electrons are injected from the n-type region to the p-type 

region through the conduction band of the high 
resistance region, and holes are injected from the p-type 

region to the n-type region through the valance band of 
the high resistance region, so that a current flows. On 

the other hand, in a case that an applied voltage is 
reverse bias because substantially no dopant is doped to 

the high resistance diamond layer, carriers are not 
present, so that a large current does not flow. 

Therefore, semiconductor conduction dominates as carrier 
conduction in pn junction and the rectification can be 

obtained, so that with the control of carriers, good 

diode characteristics or transistor characteristics can 
be achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a diamond
semiconductor device which is formed as a diode, a
transistor, or other semiconductor devices using various
conduction type dopant doped diamond as a semiconductor
material.Semiconductor devices which operate stably under
high temperature, high radiation or other environment,
and semiconductor devices which can operate with high
powered output have been expected. As a material for such
semiconductor devices, diamond has been drawing
attention.Diamond is doped with III-element or V-element,
which results in p-type semiconductor or n-type
semiconductor, respectively. Further, diamond has a
large energy gap of about 5.5eV, which means that an
intrinsic region, at which carrier movement is
uncontrollable, is not present below 1400°C. Therefore,
with use of diamond as semiconductor, a semiconductor
device which is stable thermally, that is, a
semiconductor device which can operate at high
temperature may be formed. Diamond is stable chemically and has a heat
conductivity of 20 W/cm·K which is ten times larger than
that of silicon and is superior in heat radiation.
Further, diamond has a small permitivity of 5.5, a large
breakdown voltage of 5x106V/cm and a large carrier
mobility; an electron mobility of 2000cm2/V·s and a hole
mobility of 2100cm2/V·s at 300K. Therefore, the diamond
semiconductor is also expected to be used at high
frequency and high output power.The techniques relating to such a diamond
semiconductor and a diamond semiconductor device are
described fully in "Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. SHO 59-208821
(208821/1984)", "Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. SHO
59-213126 (213126/1984)", and "Japanese Patent Laid-Open
No. SHO 62-70295 (70295/1987)". Document EP 0 445 998 A1 discloses diamond semiconductor devices wherein a non-doped
or low-doped diamond layer with high resistivity is epitaxially grown between the n-type
diamond layer and the p-type diamond layer in the pn junction diode or between the metal
layer and the doped diamond layer in the Schottky diode. In this document, first, no specific
information is given about the doping concentration in the n- and p-type layer of the device
and, second, there is no identification that the n-type dopant of said n-type diamond layer is
nitrogen.Patent abstracts of Japan, vol. 17, no. 110, 8 March 1993 and JP-A-4-293 272 disclose a
diamond P-I-N diode with an n-type Si-doped diamond semiconductor layer, a non-doped
diamond insulating layer and a p-type B-doped diamond semiconductor layer
which are formed in order
