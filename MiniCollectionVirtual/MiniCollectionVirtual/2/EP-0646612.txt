<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of thermoplastic polyesters by multistep polycondensation of dihydroxyl compounds with dicarboxylic acids or esters or ester-forming derivatives thereof, where, in at least one first step, an alkali metal compound or an alkaline earth metal compound is added in an amount from 1 to 10 mmol per kg of polyester, calculated as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal, and at least one further step is carried out as a solid-phase condensation.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of a thermoplastic polyester by
multistage polycondensation of dihydroxy compounds with

dicarboxylic acids or esters or ester-forming derivatives
thereof, wherein, in at least one first stage, an alkali

metal alcoholate or alkaline earth metal alcoholate is added
in an amount of from 1 to 10 mmol, calculated as alkali metal

or alkaline earth metal, per kg of polyester, and at least
one further stage is carried out as a solid-phase condensation.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein sodium methanolate
is used.
