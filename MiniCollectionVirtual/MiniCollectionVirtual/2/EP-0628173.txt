<ABSTRACT>
The invention lies in the domain of fiber-optics communications with optical networks, in which opto-electronic circuits integrated on semiconductor chips are interconnected by optical fibers. By means of so-called integrated optical mode form adapters, the small eccentric chip waveguide modes of the integrated opto-electronic circuits are adapted to the larger and symmetrical fiber modes, in order to achieve efficient chip waveguide-fiber optical couplings. A process is disclosed for producing such mode form adapters on semiconductor chips. Vertical, pointed waveguide cores are at first produced by means of a mask having a special geometry and by taking advantage of diffusion-limited etching and epitaxial processes, then superimposed waveguides are produced. This process is suitable for full wafer mass production.
