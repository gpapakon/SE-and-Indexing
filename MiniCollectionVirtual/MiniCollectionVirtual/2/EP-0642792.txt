<ABSTRACT>
Solutions of carboplatin and other malonato platinum(II) 
antitumor agents are prepared containing stabilizing amounts 

of 1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylic acid or salt at pH 4-8. The 
stabilizers inhibit unacceptable discoloration and 

precipitation. The solutions may also be stabilized by 
purging the carrier with air or oxygen and, optionally, 

blanketing the headspace with air or oxygen.

<DESCRIPTION>
Carboplatin, 1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxyl diammine platinum(II), 
is a white to off-white crystalline powder. Like 
cisplatin, it is a cytotoxic platinum coordination compound. 
Also like cisplatin, it has cytotoxic properties which render 
it useful in the treatment of various malignancies in mammals, 
including ovarian carcinoma. U.S. patents 4,140,707 and 4,657,927 to Cleare et al 
disclose the preparation of carboplatin and other malonato 
platinum compounds and their use in treating a standard 
screening tumor, solid sarcoma 180. This group of compounds 
may be termed "malonato" because of the presence in their 
structures of a -(OOC)2-C< linkage. Unlike cisplatin, carboplatin does not generally produce 
severe side effects, such as renal toxicity, ototoxicity and 
neurotoxicity. Carboplatin resists aquation, which thus 
contributes to its lower toxicity. It has been used to treat 
a variety of human cancers, including small cell lung cancer, 
squamous cell carcinomas and testicular cancer. See U.S. 
Pharmacist, September, 1989, pages 62-63. Carboplatin is sold as a lyophilized powder usually 
diluted with water, saline solution, dextrose solution and/or 
other diluents just before intravenous injection into a 
patient. However, its relatively low solubility in water (14 
mg/ml at room temperature) may lead to problems, e.g., "splash 
back" during reconstitution. It, like all anti-neoplastic 
agents, can have undesirable effects when in contact with 
normal tissue. A solution of carboplatin, in a concentrated ready-to-use 
(RTU) form would be very desirable to facilitate handling and 
administration. However, the compound is not physically 
stable over prolonged storage in simple aqueous solutions--i.e., 
when mixed with water alone. U.S. patent 5,104,896 to Nijkerk et al discloses an 
attempt to address this problem. Theirs are carboplatin  
 
solutions containing up to 22 mg/ml carboplatin and 0.01-0.1 
moles of inorganic-buffering agents to maintain a solution pH 
of 2 to 6.5. 
A. Bosanquet, in Cancer Chemother Pharmacol, 23: 197-207 
(1989), discussed the instability of carboplatin and suggested 
that water and sodium chloride be used to produce stable 
solutions of same. Levius et al, in E.P.O. Publication 
334,551 (published September 21, 1989) suggest that chloride 
ions should not be used in carboplatin solutions (see page 3, 
lines 7+). Furthermore, they teach that aqueous carboplatin 
solutions, containing 10-15 mg/ml of the drug, are stable if 
the drug has not been lyophilized and the

oxygen.  

 
A method of stabilizing a solution of a malonato

A process for stabilizing a malonato platinum(II) 
compound of a solution comprising the steps of: 


(1) dissolving the platinum compound in a carrier and 
adjusting the pH to 4 to 7, 
(2) purging the product of step (1) with at least one of 
air or oxygen gas, and

at least 50 volume % is unfilled with liquid, but saturated 

with air or oxygen.
