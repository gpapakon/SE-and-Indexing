<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to refrigerant compositions that include 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane 
as a component. This invention also relates to binary azeotropic 
or azeotrope-like compositions that include 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane, said 
compositions being useful as cleaning agents, expansion agents for polyolefins and 
polyurethanes, aerosol propellants, refrigerants, heat transfer media, gaseous 
dielectrics, fire extinguishing agents, power cycle working fluids, polymerization 
media, particulate removal fluids, carrier fluids, buffing abrasive agents, and 
displacement drying agents. Fluorinated hydrocarbons have many uses, one of which is as a 
refrigerant. Such refrigerants include dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12) and 
chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22). In recent years it has been pointed out that certain kinds of 
fluorinated hydrocarbon refrigerants released into the atmosphere may adversely 
affect the stratospheric ozone layer. Although this proposition has not yet been 
completely established, there is a movement toward the control of the use and the 
production of certain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and 
hydrochlorofluorocarbons(HCFCs) under an international agreement. Accordingly, there is a demand for the development of refrigerants 
that have a lower ozone depletion potential than existing refrigerants while still 
achieving an acceptable performance in refrigeration applications. 
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) have been suggested as replacements for CFCs and 
HCFCs since HFCs have no chlorine and therefore have zero ozone depletion 
potential. In refrigeration applications, a refrigerant is often lost during 
operation through leaks and shaft seals, hose connections, soldered joints and 
broken lines. In addition, the refrigerant may be released to the atmosphere during 
maintenance procedures on refrigeration equipment. If the refrigerant is not a pure 
component or an azeotrope or azeotrope-like composition, the refrigerant  
 
composition may change when leaked or discharged to the atmosphere from the 
refrigeration equipment, causing the refrigerant to become flammable or to have 
poor refrigeration performance. Accordingly, it is desirable to use as a refrigerant a single fluorinated 
hydrocarbon or an azeotropic or azeotrope-like composition that includes one or 
more fluorinated hydrocarbons. Fluorinated hydrocarbons may also be used a cleaning agent or 
solvent to clean, for example, electronic circuit boards. It is desirable that the 
cleaning agents be azeotropic or azeotrope-like because
