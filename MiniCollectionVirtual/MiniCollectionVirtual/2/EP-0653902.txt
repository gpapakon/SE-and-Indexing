<ABSTRACT>
A resonance type variable wavelength 
luminescent device which can control a spectrum of 

emission light of luminescent elements in response to an 
input signal such as voltage, heat, pressure, sound 

wave, magnetic field, electric field, gravity, electro-magnetic 
wave or the like. Sequentially formed as 

laminated on a glass substrate (101) are a semi-transparent 
reflective film (102), first electrically 

conductive transparent electrode films (103a), a 
variable optical length layer (201), second electrically 

conductive transparent electrode films (103b), a hole 
injection layer (104), an active layer (105) made of 

aluminum chelate or the like and metallic electrodes 
(106), so that the first and second electrically 

conductive transparent electrode films (103a, 103b) are 
mutually arranged in a matrix form. A voltage is 

applied between the second electrically conductive 

transparent electrode films (103b) and the metallic 
electrodes (106) to cause light emission of the active 

layer (105), whereas a voltage is applied between the 
first and second electrically conductive transparent 

electrode films (103a, 103b) to control the optical 
length of the variable optical length layer (201) and to 

control a spectrum of emission light of the device. The 
variable wavelength luminescent device can be applied to 

planar color displays, optical switches and various 
sorts of sensors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a luminescent
device and more particularly, to an electroluminescence
(which will be referred to merely as EL, hereinafter)
device which light wavelength is variable and which can
be suitably used for optical logical devices, display
devices, communication luminescent devices, read/write
heads for information files, printers, sensors, etc. in
information communication fields.There is disclosed in a journal entitled
"Japanese Journal of Applied Physics", vol. 27, No. 2
(1988), pp., L269 - L271 that an emission spectrum is
obtained based on a molecular formula for respective
organic phosphor materials of a thin film.Fig. 2 is a cross-sectional view of an
ordinary organic luminescent device which uses the
aforementioned thin film of the organic phosphor materials.
The organic luminescent device comprises a glass
substrate 101, electrically conductive transparent
electrode films 103 formed on the glass substrate 101, a
hole injection layer 104 made of diamine derivative
(abbreviated to TAD), an active layer 105, metallic
electrodes 106, these layers being sequentially formed
in this order.The electrically conductive transparent 
electrode films 103 and metallic electrodes 106 are
arranged to be orthogonal to each other, in a matrix
form. When a D.C. voltage of 5-20V is applied to the
matrix with the electrically conductive transparent
electrode films 103 as a plus terminal and the metallic
electrodes 106 as a minus terminal, an intersection part
between the plus film and minus electrode emits light
that exits from the glass substrate 101. The light
emission part is called a pixel. The emission spectrum
of the matrix is determined by the type of the luminescent
material. When aluminum chelate (abbreviated to
ALQ) is employed as the luminescent material, such a
broad emission spectrum as shown in Fig. 3 is obtained.
In this case, the emission spectrum has been determined
essentially uniquely. Further, when it is desired to
modify the emission spectrum, it has been common
practice to dope a color filter but been impossible to
freely modify the emission spectrum of a once-prepared
device.Also disclosed in a magazine entitled "Appl.
Phys. lett.", Vol. 63(5), No. 2, August 1993 is such a
matrix that, as shown in Fig. 8 (in the present
application), comprises mirror electrodes of organic
thin films formed for the metallic electrodes 106 in
Fig. 2, a semi-transparent reflective film (half mirror)
102 formed on a glass substrate 101 to have a multi-layered
structure of TiO2 and SiO2
