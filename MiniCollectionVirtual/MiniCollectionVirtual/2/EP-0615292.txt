<ABSTRACT>
In an insulated gate bipolar transistor, a 
majority carrier, such as holes, in a collector layer (10) can be 

prevented from being injected into a region ranging from 
a region of an under layer of a gate electrode (16) of 

the base layer (11) adjacent to the collector layer (10) to a 
region except an under layer of an emitter electrode (15) 

by forming a potential barrier (110a) for the majority carrier 
in the collector layer (10) into the base layer (11) 

adjacent to the collector layer (10). 
The potential barrier (110a) can be an insulator, a highly doped region 

(n⁺ if the majority carriers are holes), or a heterojunction 
constructed by using a material different than that of the substrate. 

Also, the majority 
carrier in the collector layer (10) can be prevented from 

flowing into the emitter (13) from the region of the 
under layer of the gate electrode (16) of the base layer 

adjacent to the collector layer (14) or the region except 
the under layer of the emitter electrode (15) through the 

base layer (12) adjacent to the emitter layer (13). 
Thereby latch-up of the parasitic thyristor can be prevented and the 

turn-off time can be reduced, while the other characteristics remain 
unchanged.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to semiconductor 
devices and, more particularly, is directed to an 
insulated gate type bipolar transistor. Recently, an insulated gate bipolar transistor 
(i.e., IGBT) receives a remarkable attention in the field 
of power switching devices. As shown in FIG. 9, 
insulated gate bipolar transistor has an MOS (metal oxide 
semiconductor) transistor (i.e., MOSFET) structure and a 
bipolar transistor structure together. More specifically, 
as shown in FIG. 9, a p-type collector layer 1, an 
n-type base layer 2 and a p-type base layer 3 constitute 
a bipolar transistor, and the n-type base layer 2, the 
p-type base layer 3 and an n-type emitter layer 4 
constitute an MOS transistor. The bipolar transistor and 
the MOS transistor are connected together via the above-mentioned 
semiconductor layers 2 and 3. Therefore, in 
the insulated gate bipolar transistor, when a gate 
electrode 16 is placed in its ON-state to flow a current 
based on the MOSFET structure, a conductivity in the 
bipolar transistor at its portion corresponding to the 
base layer 2 is modulated by this current and a 
conductivity in the base layer 2 is increased. As a 
consequence, a current based on the bipolar transistor 
structure also is flowed and thus an on-resistance can be  
 
lowered as compared with that of the MOSFET structure. In the insulated gate bipolar transistor, 
however, once an npnp structure included within the 
device operates as a thyristor, the switching operation 
by the gate electrode cannot be made, which is a problem 
that might be called a latch-up of a parasitic thyristor. The latch-up of the parasitic thyristor occurs 
when a junction between the emitter layer 4 and the 
adjacent base layer 3 are forward-biased by a voltage 
drop generated by a seet-resistance of the base layer 3 
adjoining the emitter layer 4. As one of means that can 
prevent the latch-up of the parasitic thyristor, there 
have heretofore been used a method for increasing a 
doping concentration of the base layer 3 adjacent to the 
emitter layer 4 as is described in IEEE Electron Device 
Letters, Vol. EDL-6, No. 7, Jul. 1985, pp. 378 - 380, 
Extended Abstracts of the 16th (1984 International) 
Conference on Solid State Devices and Materials, Kobe, 
1984, pp. 309 - 312, IEDM Tech. Dig., 1984, pp. 860 - 
861. According to this conventional method, since the 
seet-resistance of the base layer 3 adjacent to the 
emitter layer 4 is lowered, the voltage drop can be 
suppressed and the latch-up of the parasitic
