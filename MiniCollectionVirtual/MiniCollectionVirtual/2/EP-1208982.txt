<ABSTRACT>
A bi-directional fluid ejector (200) operates on the
principle of electrostatic attraction. The fluid ejector

includes a sealed dual diaphragm arrangement (210), an
electrode arrangement (220,222) that is parallel and

opposite to the sealed diaphragms, and a structure (240)
which contains the fluid to be ejected. A diaphragm

chamber (216,218) containing a relatively incompressible
fluid is situated behind, and is sealed by, the diaphragms

(210). At least one nozzle hole (242,244) is formed in a
faceplate of the ejector over one of the diaphragms (210).

A drive signal is applied to at least one electrode
(220,222) of the electrode arrangement to generate an

electrostatic field between the electrode (220,222) and a
first one of the diaphragms (210). The first diaphragm is

attracted towards the electrode (222) by an electrostatic
force into a deformed shape due to the electrostatic field.

Upon deforming, pressure is transmitted to a second one of
the sealed diaphragms (210). The transmitted pressure and

the relatively incompressible nature of the fluid contained

within the sealed diaphragm chamber (218) causes the second
diaphragm (210) to deflect in the opposite direction to

force fluid through at least one of the at least one nozzle
hole (242). After a drop is ejected, the movement is

reversed, either through normal resilient restoration
actions of the deformed diaphragm (210) and/or through an

applied force generated by the other electrode (220).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to micromachined or microelectromechanical system based fluid ejectors and fluid ejection methods.Fluid ejectors have been developed for inkjet recording or printing. Ink jet recording apparatus offer numerous benefits, including extremely quiet operation when recording, high speed printing, a high degree of freedom in ink selection, and the ability to use low-cost plain paper. The so-called "drop-on-demand" drive method, where ink is output only when required for recording, is now the conventional approach. The drop-on-demand drive method makes it unnecessary to recover ink not needed for recording.Fluid ejectors for inkjet printing include one or more nozzles which allow the formation and control of small ink droplets to permit high resolution, resulting in the ability to print sharper characters with improved tonal resolution. In particular, drop-on-demand inkjet print heads are generally used for high resolution printers.Drop-on-demand technology generally uses some type of pulse generator to form and eject drops. For example, in one type of print head, a chamber having an ink nozzle may be fitted with a piezoelectric wall that is deformed when a voltage is applied. As a result of the deformation, the fluid is forced out of the nozzle orifice as a drop. The drop then impinges directly on an associated printing surface. Use of such a piezoelectric device as a driver is described in JP-B-1990-51734.Another type of print head uses bubbles formed by heat pulses to force fluid out of the nozzle. The drops are separated from the ink supply when the bubbles collapse. Use of pressure generated by heating the ink to generate bubbles is described in JP-B-1986-59911.Yet another type of drop-on-demand print head incorporates an electrostatic actuator. This type of print head utilizes electrostatic force to eject the ink.Examples of such electrostatic print heads are disclosed in US-A-4520375 and JP-A-289351/90. The ink jet head disclosed in the '375 patent uses an electrostatic actuator comprising a diaphragm that constitutes a part of an ink ejection chamber and a base plate disposed outside of the ink ejection chamber opposite to the diaphragm. The ink jet head ejects ink droplets through a nozzle communicating with the ink ejection chamber, by applying a time varying voltage between the diaphragm and the base plate. The diaphragm and the base plate thus act as a capacitor, which causes the diaphragm to be set into mechanical motion and the fluid to exit responsive to the diaphragm's
