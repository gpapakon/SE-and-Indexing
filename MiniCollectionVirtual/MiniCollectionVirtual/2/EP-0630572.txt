<ABSTRACT>
An extrusion die assembly (10), adapted to be secured to 
the discharge end of an extruder (14), for producing 

extruded products having different sizes and/or shapes from 
a single extruder without interrupting the operation of the 

extruder. The die assembly includes a block (11) having an 
inlet duct to receive thermoplastic material discharged 

from the extruder, and a pair of discharge ducts which 
diverge axially from the inlet duct and terminate in a pair 

of spaced die plates (15, 16). A cylindrical diversion 
valve (38) is rotatably mounted in the die assembly at the 

convergence of the outlet ducts and the inlet duct, with 
the valve having an angled passage extending therethrough 

for directing the flow of thermoplastic material from the 
inlet duct into one of the outlet ducts. The diversion 

valve enables thermoplastic material to be diverted from 
one die plate to the other without interrupting the 

operation of the extruder.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates of a multi-faced extrusion die
assembly for an extruder, which facilitates production of
extruded pieces having more than one cross-sectional
configuration.
An extrusion die according to the preamble of claim 1 is known
from DE-C-4 130 002.
More particularly, the invention relates
to an extrusion die assembly adapted to be mounted on an
extruder, with the assembly having a plurality of spaced
die plates and including a rotatable diversion valve for
directing the flow of thermoplastic material from the
extruder to a selected die plate without interrupting the
operation of the extruder.Extruders are widely used in a number of industries,
particularly the food industry in which extruders are
utilized to produce a variety of products such as snack
foods, breakfast cereals, pet foods, and confections.
Extruders typically consist of one or more sets of
flighted screws which rotate within a barrel and have a
die plate mounted across the discharge end of the extruder
barrel. Thermoplastic material from the extruder is
forced through one or more die openings in the die plate,
with the openings having a particular cross-sectional
configuration whereby the extrudate has the same single
cross-sectional configuration as the die openings. The
thermoplastic material extruded through the die openings 
is cut into pieces of desired length, typically by means
of a rotary knife mounted adjacent the outer face of the
die plate.The use of die plates having die openings of more
than one cross-sectional configuration is not feasible for
it would provide non-uniform flow rates and different flow
resistances across the extrusion orifices, resulting in
the production of undesirable non-uniform extruded
pieces. Thus, the production of extruded pieces having
different shapes or sizes requires the use of separate die
plates, each having die orifices of one desired
cross-sectional configuration. In commercial production
operations, when it is desired to change the size or shape
of pieces produced from an extruder, the operation of the
extruder must be stopped while one die plate is removed
and is replaced by another die plate having orifices of
the desired size or shape.Such interruptions in the operation of the extruder
have an adverse effect on the production capacity of the
extruder and result in the loss of significant amounts of
material.The present invention provides an extrusion die
assembly adapted to be mounted on an extruder, the die
assembly having a plurality of spaced die plates and a
rotatable

A multi-faced extrusion die assembly which comprises

a block (11) having a planar back face (12) adapted to be secured to the
discharge end of an extruder, a plurality of die faces (15, 16) remote from said

back face (12) on opposing sides of the axial centerline of the block (11), a die
plate (17, 18) having at least one die orifice (20, 21) extending therethrough

mounted on each die face (15, 16),
said block (11) having an inlet duct (22) in the planar back face (12) to
receive thermoplastic material discharged from the extruder, and a plurality of

axially diverging outlet ducts (24, 25), each outlet duct (24, 25) being in
communication with said inlet duct (22) and a die orifice (20, 21) in one of the die

faces (15,16), and
diversion valve means (28) mounted in the block at the convergence of the
inlet duct (22) and the outlet ducts (24,25), said valve means having an angled

passage (30) extending therethrough,

   characterised in that the diversion valve means (28) is rotatable such that the
inlet duct (22) is connectable to any one of the outlet ducts (24,25) through the

angled passage (30).
The extrusion die assembly defined in claim 1 in which the block (11) has a
pair of the die faces (15,16) positioned on opposing sides of the axial centerline of

the block (11) and at an angle to said axial centerline, and a pair of the axially
diverging outlet ducts (24,25), one end of each outlet duct (24,25) being in

communication with a die orifice (20,21) in one of the die faces (15,16) and the
opposing end being coplanar and in communication with the inlet duct (22).
The extrusion die assembly defined in claim 2 in which the angle at which
the die faces (15,16) are positioned relative to the axial centerline of said block

(11) and the angle at which the outlet ducts (24,25) diverge from said centerline
are the same.

diversion valve means (28) comprises a cylindrical body and said angled passage 

(30) has two leg portions (35,36) which are offset from one another by the angle
which the outlet ducts (24,25) diverge axially from the inlet duct (22).
The extrusion die assembly defined in any of claims 2 to 4 in which the die
orifices (20,21) in one of said die plates (15,16) have a cross-sectional

configuration or size different than the die orifices (20,21) in the other die plate
