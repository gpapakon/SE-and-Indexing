<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fastening system containing a nut (1) and a mating piece (2), at least two fastening elements, which engage one into the other as protrusion (7) and depression (5), being provided in order to secure the nut (1) against rotation. In order, on the one hand, to secure the nut against unintentional loosening and, on the other hand, to permit simple handling during tightening and loosening, the nut consists of a flexible material (1) and is designed integrally with one of the two fastening elements (1, 2).

<CLAIMS>
Fastening system comprising a nut (1, 1') and a 
counterpart (2, 2'), wherein for protection against torsion 

of the nut (1, 1') at least two fastening elements are 
provided which interengage as a projection (7) and a 

depression (5), the nut (1, 1') being made from resilient 
material and integral with one of the two fastening elements 

(5; 7), characterised in that at least one groove (11, 13) 
is provided in the nut (1, 1') in order to increase the 

flexibility of the nut in the region of the fastening 
elements (5; 7). 
Fastening system as claimed in Claim 1, characterised 
in that a plurality of the fastening elements (5; 7) which 

are integral with the nut (1, 1') are arranged in a ring 
around the axis of rotation (8) of the nut (1, 1') on the 

end face (1a) of the nut (1, 1') which comes into contact 
with the counterpart (2, 2'). 
Fastening system as claimed in Claim 2, characterised 
in that the fastening elements (5; 7) are arranged in the 

radially outer region of the end face (1a). 
Fastening system as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the counterpart (2, 2') is 

constructed with at least one other fastening element (7; 
5). 
Fastening system as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the projection (boss 7) has a 

rounded shape and the depression (5) has a matching shape. 
Fastening system as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the projection (boss 7) is in 

the form of a spherical segment.  
 
Fastening system as claimed in Claim 1, characterised 
in that the groove (11) is arranged concentrically around 

the axis of rotation (8) of the nut (1, 1') and opens in the 
end face (1a) of the nut which comes into contact with the 

counterpart (2, 2'). 
Fastening system as claimed in Claim 1, characterised 
in that the groove (13) is provided in the radial circumferential 

surface (1'b) of the nut (1'). 
Fastening system as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the nut (1, 1') can be 

actuated by hand. 
Fastening system as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the nut (1, 1') is constructed 

as a knurled nut. 
Fastening system as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the nut (1, 1') has a bore (4, 

4') provided with an internal thread. 
Fastening system as claimed in Claim 6, characterised 
in that the radius of the sphere which forms the shape of 

the projection (boss 7) is greater than the height (h) of 
the projection. 
Fastening system as claimed in Claim 12, characterised 
in that the height (h) of the projections is 1 to 10 percent 

of half the difference between the diameter of the nut (d
2
) 
and of the bore (d
1
). 
Fastening system as claimed in Claim 1 for coils in 
solenoid valves, characterised in that the counterpart is 

formed by a coil (2').  
 
Fastening system as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the nut (1, 1') is constructed 

integrally with a plurality of depressions (5).
