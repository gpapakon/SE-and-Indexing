<ABSTRACT>
A hanging cloth attaching device (4) situated 
between a cloth hanging member (3) movable along a 

guide member (2) and a hanging cloth (1), to an upper 
edge of which a female engaging member is attached, 

for connecting the upper edge of the hanging cloth (1) 
and the cloth hanging member (3), the device comprising: 

a hook-shape piece to be caught on the cloth 
hanging member (3); and a plate-like male engaging 

member (42) having on one face a male engaging surface 
(43) with a multiplicity of hooks projecting therefrom; 

the hook-shape piece (41) and the plate-like 
male engaging member (42) being integrally formed of 

synthetic resin, the male engaging surface (43) having 
a flat portion devoid of the hooks at least at a region 

where an ejector pin contacts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hanging cloth attaching
device which enables simple attaching and
detaching of various kinds of hanging cloth, such as
curtains for use in home, office, theater, hospital,
etc., to and from a hanger in the form of a curtain
runner supported by a guide member such as a curtain
rail or a guide rod. More particularly the invention
relates to a hanging cloth attaching device which is
excellent in producibility and can be colored with
a wide color selection to fit to the design and
color of a cloth to be hung.Most of curtains in, for example, hospitals and
hotels are rental and are exchanged periodically for
cleaning. In order to facilitate this exchanging work,
the attaching and detaching of the individual curtains
must be done in a simple manner. Conventionally, various
proposals have been made to facilitate the attaching
and detaching of a curtain to and from the curtain
runner supported by a guide member such as a curtain
rail or a guide rod.For example, in one conventional hanging cloth
attaching device disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication 
No. SHO 40-27706 and Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open
Publication No. SHO 57-142986, a number of
curtain runners are attached to an elongated male or
female surface fastener tape at regular distances and,
on the other hand, a companion surface fastener tape
engageable with the first-named surface fastener tape
is attached to the upper edge of a curtain along its
entire length. When the opposite surface fasteners are
only pressed against each other with a relative small
force, the curtain can be attached to the curtain runner.
For detaching the curtain from the curtain runner,
it is required only to peel off the opposite surface
fasteners from each other.According to another conventional hanging cloth
attaching device disclosed in Japanese Utility Model
Laid-Open Publication No. HEI 2-107387, a male or female
surface fastener is attached to an engaging portion
of the curtain runner and, on the other hand, a companion
surface fastener is attached to the upper edge of a
curtain for engagement with the curtain-runner-side
surface fastener so that the attaching and detaching
of the curtain can be performed in a simple manner.However, with either of the two conventional
hanging cloth attaching devices, since the surface
fasteners are formed by knitting and/or weaving, not
only it is poor in producibility, but it is difficult
to secure adequate engaging force. In an attempt to solve these problems, the present
inventor has developed a hanging

A hanging cloth attaching device (4) situated between
a cloth hanging member (3) movable along a guide member (2)

and a hanging cloth (1), to an upper edge of which a female
engaging member (11) is attached, for connecting the upper

edge of the hanging cloth (1) and the cloth hanging member
(3),


wherein said device comprises a hook-shape member (41)
to hook on the cloth hanging member (3), and a plate-like male

engaging member (42) having on one face a male engaging
surface (43) with a multiplicity of hooks (43a) projecting

therefrom; and
wherein said hook-shape member (41) and said plate-like
male engaging member (42) are integrally formed of

synthetic resin, said male engaging surface (43) having a flat
portion (43b) devoid of the hooks (43a) at least at a region

where an ejector pin contacts,

characterized in that said hooks (43a) are provided in
vertical rows on both sides of said flat portion (43b), the

orientation of the hooks being upward in each of the rows,
except one of the two rows being contiguous to said flat

portion (43b), where the hook orientation is downward.
