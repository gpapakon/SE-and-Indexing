<DESCRIPTION>
A bus repeater receives a logic signal on one bus 
and retransmits it on another. A unidirectional bus 
repeater transmits a logic signal in only one direction 
from a "master" bus to a "slave" bus while a bi-directional 
bus repeater can transmit logic signals in 
either direction between two buses. Bi-directional bus 
repeaters of the prior art generally require a control 
signal input indicating the direction the logic signal 
is to be transmitted. That is, the control signal 
indicates at any given moment which of the two buses is 
to transmit a logic signal and which bus is to receive 
it. However, in some applications such a control 
signal may not be available and a bi-directional bus 
repeater that transmits signals between two buses in 
either direction without need for a direction 
indicating control signal input would be of advantage. 
For example, one such bi-directional bus repeater, for 
transmitting signals between first and second buses, is 
disclosed in WO-A-86/01959, and may be considered to 
comprise: first unidirectional bus repeater means, 
connected for receiving a first logic signal carried on 
said first bus and at least one first indicating 
signal, for generating a second logic signal on said 
second bus when said first logic signal is asserted and 
said first indicating signal is not asserted, and for 
asserting at least one second indicating signal when 
generating said second logic signal; and second 
unidirectional bus repeater means, connected for 
receiving said second logic signal and said at least 
one second indicating signal, for generating said first 
logic signal when said second logic signal is asserted 
and said second indicating signal is not asserted, and 
for asserting said at least one first indicating signal 
when generating said first logic signal.  
 In this bi-directional repeater each of the 
unidirectional bus repeaters is arranged, when enabled 
to transmit a data signal over its associated bus, to 
output a feedback signal to a logic circuit. In 
response to such a feedback signal, triggered by 
transmission of a data signal by one of the bus 
repeaters, the logic circuit conditions a one-shot 
circuit to output an enabling signal to the other 
unidirectional bus repeater so that the other bus 
repeater is already enabled, if a data signal is 
received which is required to be transmitted over its 
associated bus, so that such a received data signal can 
be transmitted quickly by the other bus repeater. Another example of a bi-directional bus repeater

A bi-directional bus repeater for transmitting 
signals between first and second buses comprising: 


first unidirectional bus repeater means (11), 
connected for receiving a first logic signal (A) 

carried on said first bus (14) and at least one first 
indicating signal (AD), for generating a second logic 

signal (B) on said second bus (12) when said first 
logic signal (A) is asserted and said first indicating 

signal is not asserted (AD), and for asserting at least 
one second indicating signal (BD) when generating said 

second logic signal; and 
second unidirectional bus repeater means (13), 
connected for receiving said second logic signal (B)

logic signal (B) to a high logic state upon assertion 
of said PULL UP signal (BU) and for driving said second 

logic signal (B) to a low logic level in response to 
assertion of said PULL DOWN signal (BD), said PULL UP 

and PULL DOWN signals (BU, BD) comprising said at least 
one second indicating signal; 
logic gate means (24), connected for receiving 
said first logic signal (A) and said at least one first 

indicating signal (AD), for asserting and deasserting 
said PULL DOWN signal (BD) in response to logical 

combinations of states of said first logic signal (A) 
and said at least one first indicating signal (AD); and  

 
single-shot means (22), connected for receiving 
said PULL DOWN signal (BD), for temporarily asserting 

said PULL UP signal (BU) when said PULL DOWN signal 
(BD) is deasserted.

receiving said PULL UP signal (U; BU), and 
a second transistor (T2) having load terminals 
connected between said source of low logic level (L) 

and said second bus (12), and a control terminal 
receiving said PULL DOWN signal (D; BD). 
The bi-directional bus repeater in accordance with 
claim 3 wherein said buffer means (18) further 

comprises a resistor (R) connected between said source 
of high logic level (H) and said second bus (12).
