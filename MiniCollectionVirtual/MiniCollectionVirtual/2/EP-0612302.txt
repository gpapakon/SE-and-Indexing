<ABSTRACT>
An insertable pallet for unloading or acquiring objects or for loading or piling objects, particularly in a stacked position, comprising at least one live roller (101) for moving an object being unloaded or loaded along the insertable pallet (100). In the unloading mode of the insertable pallet, the insertable pallet (100) is thrust at an object seam until the insertable pallet is underneath the object being unloaded a sufficient distance to engage at least one live roller of said insertable pallet for moving the object from its initial position along said pallet. In the loading mode of the insertable pallet, an object being loaded is moved to and preferably partially over the front of the insertable pallet by at least one live roller. The insertable pallet is appropriately positioned so that when the object arrives at the front of the insertable pallet an operator can nudge the object of the insertable pallet with a minimum of physical effort.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus and a 
method for handling, acquiring or loading an object. 
US 3 715 043 discloses such a known apparatus and method. Packages or parcels being shipped or transported 
frequently require loading or unloading during the transportation 
process. For example, during the shipment process 
parcels are typically loaded onto and unloaded from 
trailers and other storage or transportation media. Such 
parcels are often nonuniform in size and weight and must 
be stored in stacked arrangements. In the known art, unloading 
of such objects is usually done manually by persons 
taking the objects from a trailer or other container 
and placing them on a conveyor belt. Likewise, much loading 
is performed by persons taking packages or objects 
from a conveyor and stacking them in a trailer or other 
storage area. Such use of conveyors to assist in the manual 
handling of objects is taught by US Patent No. 
4 425 069, issued to Saur et al., US Patent No. 
4 281 955, issued to McWilliams, US Patent No. 3 389 690 
issued to Jerome and US Patent No. 2 634 870, issued to 
Barnum. Various attempts have been made to automate the 
loading and unloading of trailers. For example, there 
have been trailers  
 
with moveable floors which function as conveyors depositing an 
entire load of packages or objects at the trailer end. However, 
these devices are not suitable for applications involving fragile 
packages or objects. Items of this type were damaged during 
unloading. Trailers made to function like dump trucks proved 
similarly unworkable. In order to provide damage free loading and unloading 
of delicate objects, it is generally believed that objects or 
groups of objects must be treated as individual units. Such 
operations therefore typically involve a substantial amount of 
manual labor. Due to factors such as limited reach, limited 
speed and limited strength, persons performing manual loading and 
unloading often prove to be a limiting factor during such 
operations. Thus, parcel transportation companies have limited 
the weight of packages which can be transported due to the 
physical limitations of their manual laborers. Manual unloading 
is further complicated by difficulty in dislodging and acquiring 
objects or packages which have been stored or transported in a 
stacked configuration, because it is often difficult to get 
fingers or knuckles between close objects or packages for 
gripping. Several attempts at automated package handling are 
known in the prior art. For

An apparatus for handling an object (108-110) comprising 
a wedge-shaped insertable pallet (100),
characterized
 in that
 
said insertable pallet (100) has at least one live 

roller means (101) for moving said object (108-110) 
along said pallet (100), the front-most live roller 

means (101) being separated from the front edge of 
the wedge-shaped insertable pallet (100) by the front 

portion (103) of the insertable pallet (100). 
The apparatus of claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
said insertable pallet (100) comprises at least one 

positioning roller (102) for facilitating insertion 
of said insertable pallet under said object.

characterized in that
 
said live roller means (101) comprises splined roller 

means for gripping said object. 
The apparatus of claim 5,
 
characterized in that
 
said splined roller means are oriented to center said 

object on said insertable pallet.  
 
The apparatus of claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
said insertable pallet (100) comprises means (107) 

for directing air against said object. 
The apparatus of claim 5,
 
characterized in that
 
said means for directing air are oriented to impart a 

force vector to said object in the direction of motion 
of said object. 
The apparatus of claim 1,
 
characterized in further comprising
 
leveling means for maintaining said insertable pallet 

in a generally level orientation. 
The apparatus of claim 7,
 
characterized in further comprising
 
resilient spring means, said insertable pallet being 

resiliently coupled to said leveling means by said 
resilient spring means, said resilient spring means 

being adapted to bias said insertable pallet in said 
level orientation. 
The apparatus of claim 1,
 
characterized in further comprising
 
carrying means for positioning said insertable pallet. 
A method for acquiring an object, comprising the step 
of wedging an insertable pallet, provided with live roller means at a position distant from 

the front edge of the insertable pallet underneath said object,  
 

and actively 
advancing said object along said insertable pallet by

characterized in further comprising
 
the step of centering said object on said insertable 

pallet. 
The method of claim 10,
 
characterized in further comprising
 
the step of providing a cushion of air between said 

object and said insertable pallet. 
The method of claim 13,
 
characterized in that
