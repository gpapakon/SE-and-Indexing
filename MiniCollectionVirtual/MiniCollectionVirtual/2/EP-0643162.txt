<ABSTRACT>
A transfer device (5) for pushing labels (E) into the sewing region (2) of a sewing machine (1) comprises a label receptacle (7) arranged vertically offset relative to the sewing region (2) and angularly offset about a transverse axis relative to the sewing direction, and further comprises a feeder (8) moveable to and fro between the label receptacle (7) and the sewing region (2). In order to achieve a simple and functionally reliable label feed, without freedom of operation being impaired, the feeder (8) has a deflecting guide (15), attached to the label receptacle (7), and a slider (18) cooperating with the deflecting guide (15), the slider (18) comprising a spring tongue (21) which is displaceable via an actuating drive (19) and projects freely in the direction of guidance and the front tongue end (23) of which is moveable forwards from a retracted initial position into a take-over position within the label receptacle (7) in order to grasp a label (E) and along the deflecting guide (15) into a transfer position at the guide outlet (17) in order to release the labels in the sewing region (2).

<CLAIMS>
A transfer device (5) for the insertion of labels 
(E) into the sewing zone (2) of a sewing machine (1), 

comprising a label holder (7) which is adapted to be 
connected to a label conveyor, is disposed to be 

vertically offset from the sewing zone (2) and offset 
about a transverse axis so as to be at an angle to the 

sewing direction, and a feeder (8) adapted to 
reciprocate between the label holder (7) and the sewing 

zone (2), characterised in that the feeder (8) 
comprises a deflecting guide (15) attaching to the 

label holder (7) and bridging the vertical and angular 
offset, and a slide (18) which co-operates with the 

guide (15), the slide (18) consisting of a spring 
tongue (21) or the like, which is displaceable by way 

of an actuating drive (19), projects freely in the 
guide direction, and the front end (23) of which is 

adapted to move forward from a withdrawn initial 
position into a transfer position inside the label 

holder (7) to engage a label (E) and along the 
deflecting guide (15) into a transfer position at the 

guide outlet (17) to release the label. 
A transfer device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that an opening magnet (25) for 

lifting the front tongue end (23) away from the 
deflecting guide (15) is provided at the guide outlet 

(17). 
A transfer device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the actuating drive (19) of the 

spring tongue (21), which actuating drive is disposed 
on the side of the label holder (7) remote from the  

 
guide start (16), is aligned substantially parallel to 

the guide start (16) and engages the rear tongue end at 
a lateral distance from the guide start, deflecting 

members (22) for deflecting the free tongue zone in the 
direction towards the guide start (16) being provided 

in front of the label holder (7) in the path of 
displacement of the spring tongue (21). 
A transfer device according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the actuating drive consists of a 

toothed belt drive (19) which is equipped with a 
stepping motor and on the toothed belt (19) of which 

there is mounted a driver (20) for fixing the spring 
tongue (21), which is arranged parallel to the toothed 

belt. 
A transfer device according to any one of claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the label holder (7) 

consists of a slot chamber (11) formed by two parallel 
side wall plates (9, 10) receiving preferably 

adjustable end stops (13) for the label (E), one (9) of 
said side wall plates which merges into the deflecting 

guide (15) being stationary while the other (10) is 
disposed to be transversely movable, a tongue passage 

gap (24) being kept free between the side wall plates 
(9, 10) in the edge zone remote from the deflecting 

guide (15), and an alignment stop (14) for the label 
(E) being provided on the transversely movable side 

wall plate (10) in the edge zone facing the deflecting 
guide.
