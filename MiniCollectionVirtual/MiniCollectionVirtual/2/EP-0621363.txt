<ABSTRACT>
An automatic hemming apparatus for supplying a tubular 
workpiece in an adequate attitude to a sewing machine (4) is 

disclosed. The apparatus has a workpiece position control 
device (21) and a guide (19) for folding a circular edge of 

the workpiece in front of a sewing bed (6). The sewing 
machine (4) is provided a delivery roller (10) at the rear 

side and an assisting feed belt (26) at the outside of the 
sewing bed (6). The device (21) comprises an edge sensor 

(17) and inclined freely rotatable rollers (22A to 22D) so 
as to contact with the workpiece on the outer surfaces 

thereof. On the feeding operation of roller (10) and belt 
(26), according to a signal from the sensor (17), a stepping 

motor (24) changes the inclining direction of the rollers 
(22A to 22D) and the workpiece is moved toward right or 

left.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic hemming 
apparatus for tubular workpieces such as T-shirts, 
underwears, jogging shorts, free-size skirts and pants. 
When a tubular workpiece is supplied to the apparatus, a 
bottom edge of the workpiece is folded over to the inside, 
and the folded edge is automatically sewn or "hemmed" 
between a feed dog provided in a sewing bed and a presser 
foot facing thereto. In a hemming apparatus for tubular workpieces of this 
type, it is technically most important that a folded edge of 
the workpiece is guided to a position spaced from a sewing 
needle by a predetermined distance, and adequately 
controlled in position so that a seam is formed in parallel 
with the edge, and those disclosed, for example, in Japanese 
Laid-Open Patent Nos. 2-95396, 4-256780, 4-256781, 2-23987 
and Published Patent No. 1-1155 and U.S. Patent No. 
4,825,787 are known as such apparatuses. In the cited 
references, various position control technologies are 
disclosed for detecting an offset of the edge by a  
 
photoelectric sensor, and forcing the edge to an appropriate 
position according to the amount of the offset detected. Such conventional hemming apparatuses for tubular 
workpieces, however, are semi-automatic, and such assisting 
operations of manually leading and keeping the workpiece by 
an operator are indispensable in order to ensure that the 
edge of workpiece is guided to a predetermined position. 
Because such assisting operation is manually performed for 
guiding the edge of workpiece, the operating (sewing) 
efficiency is insufficient, and it also requires a certain 
level of experiences and skills. Hence, it is a first object of the invention to provide 
a hemming apparatus for tubular workpieces that only 
requires a tubular workpiece to be supplied over a sewing 
bed thereof, without resort to any manual work thereafter, 
folds over an edge of the workpiece along a predetermined 
position, and adequately sews along the folded edge for 
significantly increasing the operating efficiency and 
productivity. It is another object of the invention that one operator 
easily handles two apparatuses at the same time by providing 
a unique motion in a stacker for stacking hemmed tubular 
workpieces.  An automatic hemming apparatus according to the 
invention comprises a sewing bed with a feed dog 
incorporated therein, support members for a tubular 
workpiece placed horizontally in front and rear sides of the 
bed, respectively, a workpiece feeder for feeding the 
workpiece

<CLAIMS>
An automatic hemming apparatus comprising a sewing 
machine (4) with a sewing bed (6), support members provided 

horizontally in front and rear sides of the sewing bed, a 
workpiece feeder (16) for transporting a tubular workpiece 

placed over the front and rear support members in a feeding 
direction along the sewing bed from the front to rear side 

thereof, an edge detecting sensor (17) for detecting a 
circular edge of the tubular workpiece, a workpiece guide 

(19) disposed between the sewing bed and the front support 
member for folding the circular edge to an inside of the 

tubular workpiece when the workpiece is transported in the 
feeding direction and an edge position controller (21) 

placed in the vicinity of the front support member (9) for 
controlling a position of the circular edge in a direction 

across the feeding direction of the workpiece, said 
automatic hemming apparatus further comprising an assisting 

workpiece feeder belt (26) for feeding in the feeding 
direction identical to that of the workpiece feeder (16) is
