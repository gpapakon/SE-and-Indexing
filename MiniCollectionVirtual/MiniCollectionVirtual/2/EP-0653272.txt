<ABSTRACT>
A removable cover (10) for a paint spray gun and 
similar tools. The cover (10) is formed into two halves 

(12, 13) which enclose opposite sides of the gun. A tab 
(34) on the front of each cover half (12, 13) is retained 

in a notch in the gun. Rear ends of the cover halves (12, 
13) are releasable secured together by a first spring clip 

(44) positioned in aligned grooves (37) in the cover halves 
(12, 13). Ends of the cover halves which extend over a gun 

handle (21) are releasable secured together by a second 
spring clip (45) positioned in aligned grooves (40) in the 

cover halves (12, 13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a body and handle cover for
a gun shaped tool
according to the pre-characterising portion of claim 1,
and more particularly to a removable
cover for a spray gun.
A removable cover of the type described in the
pre-characterising portion of claim 1 is known from US-A-3799447.Paint spray guns are most commonly provided with a
solid metal body and an integral handle which are bored out
to form paint and air passages and chambers for a
triggering mechanism and for seals. During use, paint may
accumulate on the exterior of the gun. Cleaning the
exterior of the gun may necessitate submersion of the
entire gun in solvent. It may be necessary to partially
disassemble the gun to remove trapped solvent after
cleaning. Some spray guns are provided with a plastic
cover which encloses a frame including a body, a handle
and a portion of the trigger mechanism. The cover is
secured with screws set into recessed cavities in the
cover. The cover can be removed from the frame to
facilitate cleaning. Once removed, the cover is easily
cleaned without having to submerge the entire gun in
solvent and, once cleaned, the cover is easily dried.
US-A-3006560
discloses a spray gun having a two piece plastics cover
which is secured to the handle by the combination of a
recess provided on the handle into which an end of each
piece of the plastics cover is received and by pins or
screws received in holes in the cover and handle. Removing
a number of screws may be time consuming and there is a
risk that the small screws will be lost. On spray guns and
other tools, ease of cleaning and servicing with a minimum
of tools is a valued product feature.Providing a removable cover on a hand tool has an
additional advantage. Tools are sometimes accidentally
dropped or otherwise damaged during use. If the cover is
damaged, it may be replaced. If the tool has no
replaceable cover, it is necessary to construct the tool
from stronger, heavier materials to reduce the risk of 
damage. This increases the weight of the tool which in
turn increases operator fatigue during use.Accordingly, in a first aspect the present invention provides
a removable cover for a
gun shaped tool having a body and a handle extending from
the body, comprising first and second cover halves, said
cover halves having a shape and size for enclosing at least
a portion of the tool body and handle when said halves are
positioned together characterised in that each of said
cover halves has tab means projecting from a front end
portion for engaging a notch on

portion for engaging a notch on the tool for securing said
front end portions of said cover (10) to the tool, each of

said cover halves (12, 13) has a first groove (37)
adjacent a rear portion and a second groove (40) adjacent

an end of the handle portion, and first spring clip means (44)
is provided for positioning in said first grooves (37) and adapted for securing the

rear cover portions together, and second spring clip means
(45) is provided for positioning in said second grooves (40) and adapted for

securing together said cover handle portions.
A removable cover according to claim 1, wherein each of said
first grooves (37) has an end which aligns with an

end of the other first groove (37) when said cover halves
(12, 13) are positioned together, and wherein each of said second

grooves (40) has an end which aligns with an end of
the other second groove (40) when said cover halves (12,

13) are positioned together.

preceding claims, wherein each cover half (12, 13) has a

pair of ridges (41, 42) formed on the handle end portion
for such cover half, and wherein said second groove (40)

on each cover half extends between the ridges on such cover 
half, whereby said ridges (41, 42) help retain said second

clip means (45) in said second grooves (40).
A removable cover according to any one of the
preceding claims, wherein said first clip means (44) is

formed from spring wire and has substantially the shape of
at least a portion of said first grooves (37) when said

cover halves (12, 13) are positioned together, said first
clip means (44) having a size requiring deflection for

insertion into said first grooves (37), and wherein said
second clip means (45) is formed from spring wire and has

substantially the shape of at least a portion of said
second grooves (40) when said cover halves (12, 13) are

positioned together, said second clip means (45) having a
