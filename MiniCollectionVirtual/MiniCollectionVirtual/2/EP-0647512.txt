<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for metering granular, pulverulent or highly viscous substances, in
particular for plastics material processing machines, comprising a disc (3)

which is rotatably mounted in horizontal plane and provided with one or
more through-apertures (4), with a base plate (2), including at least two

through-apertures (1), being arranged directly below said disc, wherein at
least one of said through-apertures is provided for sample-taking purposes

and at least one for metering and further conveying the material,
characterized in that at least one fixed deflector (5) is mounted directly

above said rotatable disc (3) between a storage region (A) containing the
material to be metered and a delivery region (B, C, D, E), wherein the disc

(3) can be operated in the direction toward the sample-taking and in
opposite direction of metering.
Apparatus according to patent claim 1, characterized in that a second
deflector (5) is arranged between a second delivery region (E) and the first

delivery region (B, C, D).
Method for operating an apparatus for metering granular, pulverulent or
highly viscous substances, in particular for plastics material processing

machines, comprising a disc (3) including one or more through-apertures,
which is rotatably mounted directly above a flat base plate (2) provided with

at least two through-apertures, wherein at least one deflector (5) is situated
directly above the disc (3), characterized in that contrary to the supply of the

first through-aperture (1), the direction of rotation of the disc is reversed in
order to supply of the second through-aperture (1) of the base plate (2).
