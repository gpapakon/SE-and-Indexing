<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to extra low fat margarine-like 
spreads and to processes of preparing the spreads. In light of the rising consumer demand for low fat, low 
calorie products, food scientists are faced with a 
challenging task of producing a spread which has the 
texture, spreadability, and organoleptic properties similar 
to margarine but which contains less than 80 wt% fat 
typically present in margarine. It is particularly 
difficult to attain the spreadability, body, texture, and 
taste of margarine in spreads containing 5 wt% or less fat, 
or in spreads containing practically no fat. Cheese spreads containing fat at low levels have been 
disclosed. For instance, US 4,379,175 discloses a method 
of preparing a low fat cream cheese; the method includes 
the steps of admixing milk, a fat-containing carrier and a 
stabilizer and heating the mixture to a temperature in the 
range of from to admixing dry cottage cheese curd, and 
homogenizing the curd mixture at pressures in the range 35 
to 352 kg/cm2 (500 to 5000 psi). Cottage cheese curd comprises 
70 to 85 wt% of the product. The fat content of the product 
is from about 0.7 wt% to less than about 2 wt%. The resulting 
low fat cream cheese type product resembles cream cheese in 
appearance, texture, and taste. 
US 5,079,024 concerns the manufacture of a non-fat cream 
cheese product with a smooth and butterlike texture 
containing less than 1.5% fat obtained by mixing of a 
concentrated milk source, a bulking agen, a first and a 
second gum, and an emulsifier salt. In "Food Product Development, vol. 9, 1975, pp. 68, 70 and 
74", cheese-flavoured dairy spreads with an ash content of  
 
2.1 to 4.4%, a high casein content and free of emulsifying 
salts have been disclosed. With respect to margarine-like products, a number of 
references disclose formulations, which although they 
contain lower levels of fat than margarine, still include 
more than 5 wt% fat. GB 2,229,077, for example, discloses 
a margarine containing 5-30% fat mixture containing 
hardened fat, 8-15% maltodextrin, optionally 0.5-3% 
modified starch, 1-2% whey protein concentrate, 0.4-0.6% 
gelatin. The process disclosed in the '077 application 
for making the margarine employs a step of homogenizing a 
heated blend at a pressure of at least 817 kg/cm2 (11,600 
psi). U.S. Patent 4,497,834, discloses a dairy-based 
non-cheese food product, which may contain from 5 to 40% 
fat. Non-fat milk solids comprise 15 to 50% of the 
product. The product may include a stabilizer, e.g. 
carboxym

<CLAIMS>
A water continuous margarine-like spread comprising less 
than or equal to 5% fat and comprising at least 9% of 

casein, wherein the spread contains less than 1.05% ash, and 
is free of emulsifying salts. 
A water-continuous margarine-like spread according to 
claim 1 comprising less than or equal to 5% fat and 

comprising 

(a) at least about 9% of casein, and 
(b) a gel-forming system including a gelling agent A and a 
gelling agent B wherein a gelling agent A is selected from 

the group consisting of gelatin, kappa-carrageenan, 
iota-carrageenan, alginate, agar, gellan, pectin, and 

mixtures thereof, a gelling agent B is selected from the 
group consisting of gelling starch, denatured whey protein, 

denatured bovine serum protein, denatured soy protein, 
microcystalline cellulose and mixtures thereof, wherein the 

amount of gelling agent A is from 0.5% to 1.5%, 
and the amount of gelling agent B is from 2% to 

12%. 
The spread of claim 1 or 2 wherein the spread comprises 
less than 0.7% ash. 
The spread of claim 1 or 2 wherein the casein is derived 
from an electrodialysed dairy ingredient. 
The spread of claim 1 or 2 comprising from about 9% to 
about 15% of casein. 
The spread of claim 1 or 2 comprising less than 3.2% fat. 
The spread of claim 2 comprising from about 2% to about 
8% of gelling agent B.  

 
The spread of claim 1 or 2 comprising from 10% to 
35% total solids. 
A process of preparing a water-continuous margarine-like 
spread according to claim 1 the process comprising: 


(i) preparing a mixture comprising fat at a level not 
greater than 5 wt%, at least 9 wt% casein, and a 

gel-forming system including a gelling agent A and a 
gelling agent B wherein a gelling agent A is selected 

from the group consisting of gelatin, kappa-carrageenan, 
iota-carrageenan, alginate, agar, gellan, pectin, and 

mixtures thereof, a gelling agent B is selected from the 
group consisting of gelling starch, denatured whey 

protein, denatured bovine serum protein, denatured soy 
protein, microcystalline cellulose and mixtures thereof, 

wherein the amount of gelling agent A is from 
0.5 wt% to 1.5 wt%, and the amount of gelling agent 

B is from 2 wt% to 12 wt%; 
(ii) homogenizing the mixture at a pressure in the range 
of from 35 to 984 kg/cm

(iv) homogenizing the heated blend at a pressure in the 
range of from 35 to 984 kg/cm
2
 (500 to
