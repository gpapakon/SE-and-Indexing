<ABSTRACT>
Metal device for vertically fastening sheets of ventilated coverings made of ceramic, marble, granite and other natural or artificial materials, formed of two elements with extensions which fit into special slots made on the reverse side of the plates and which, by means of screw-tightening, compress the material, securely attaching it, forcing it solely into this compression. Having fitted the clips onto the reverse side of the plates beforehand, these plates can be used by fitting from top to bottom onto the horizontal laths of the substructure, which is necessary to produce walls with ventilated linings. The plates are levelled simply by acting on the adjustment screw of the two upper clips of each plate. A hexagon socket set screw is applied to the tab fixed to two clips per plate, these being aligned with the vertical. It is used to lock the two clips to the respective horizontal laths of the substructure so that the plates cannot move horizontally or come out of the supports, at least so long as it has not firstly been slackened. By operating on the screws in question of several plates aligned vertically with one another you can replace one plate independently of the others.
