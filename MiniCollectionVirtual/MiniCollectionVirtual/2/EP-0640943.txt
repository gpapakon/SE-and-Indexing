<ABSTRACT>
When one part is designated in designing the layout 
of a unit comprising a plurality of parts, a cross 

section of this part is set as a "sketch surface" 
automatically. The designer creates a two-dimensional 

figure, which relates to a design change, in this sketch 
surface. A CAD apparatus generates a three-dimensional 

shape based upon this two-dimensional figure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a CAD (computer aided
design) apparatus utilized in the design of machines and
the like and in drafting. More particularly, the
invention relates to a shape modeling apparatus and
method utilized in a computer system.When modeling of machine parts and the like is
performed in the prior art, the method adopted is to
model part shape by performing the following operation
for each part: First, the part to be created or
corrected is specified, then a method of generating the
shape of the part is designated and so is the sketch
surface on which the cross section of the part is to be
sketched. After the cross section is sketched, the
three-dimensional shape of the part is generated.In a case where layout design is performed in
machine design in order to lay out the parts and units,
shape and arrangement often are decided so as not to
interfere with the arrangement and shape of surrounding
parts and units.However, according to the conventional shape
modeling method in which parts are modeled on a per-part
basis, a transition cannot be made to shape creation or 
correction processing of a succeeding part until the
shape creation or correction of the preceding part is
completed. Consequently, deciding shape and layout
while applying the trial-and-error method to a plurality
of parts simultaneously is not suited to a desirable
layout design.This will be described in specific terms with
reference to Figs. 1A through 1E. In Fig. 1A, a case is
considered in which layout design is applied to a part
101 having the shape of a rectangular parallelepiped and
a part 100 having an L-shaped configuration. Fig. 1B is
a diagram showing the two parts 100, 101 of Fig. 1A when
viewed from the front side. Now consider a case in
which a triangular prism 102 having a triangular bottom
as shown in Fig. 1C is added on to the rectangular
parallelepiped 101. The designer (operator) has a
picture of the figure of Fig. 1C in his or her mind and
proceeds first to sketch a triangle 103, as shown in
Fig. 1D, on a display screen appearing as illustrated in
Fig. 1A or 1B. Next, by applying a "pushing" operation
to the triangle 103 in the "depth" direction, the
triangular prism 102 can be completed on the rectangular
parallelepiped 101. By virtue of the "pushing"
operation, the triangular prism 102 is formed on the
rectangular parallelepiped 101, as shown in Fig. 1C.
Next, while taking interference between the triangular 
prism 102 and L-shaped member 100 into consideration,
the operator sketches a cut-out 104 in the
