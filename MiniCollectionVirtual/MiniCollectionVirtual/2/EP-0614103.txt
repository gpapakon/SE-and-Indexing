<ABSTRACT>
The telescope comprises:   - a head objective (Lu) formed by a single lens in order to receive infrared rays coming from an observed scene; - a first visible/infrared beam splitter (S1) placed between, on the one hand, a daytime sight (V) and, on the other hand, a scanning device (S) having oscillating mirrors (T, G); - an infrared collimation lens (Ci) placed between the scanning device (S) and an infrared detector (D) in order to focus each point of the observed scene on the detector; - a second visible/infrared splitter (S2) placed between, on the one hand, the collimation lens (Ci) and the scanning device (S) and, on the other hand, between the scanning device (S) and an array (matrix) of light-emitting diodes (L).   Applications will be for thermal imaging devices.

Sight with oscillating mirrors (T, G) for infrared 
vision, including: 


a head objective (L
u
) for receiving infrared 
rays originating from an observed scene, 
a first visible and infrared beam splitter (S
1
) 
placed between, on the one hand, a day sight (V) and, on 

the other hand, a scanning device (S) with oscillating 
mirrors (T, G), 
a second visible-infrared splitter (S
2
) placed 
between, on the one hand, the infrared detector (D) and 

the scanning device (S) and, on the other hand, between 
the scanning device (S) and an array of light-emitting 

diodes (L) or diode lasers, for splitting the infrared 
rays, originating from the scanning device (S) and sent 

to the infrared detector (D) from the visible rays 
emitted by the light-emitting diode (L), the emission of 

the visible rays by the light-emitting diodes (L) being 
controlled by the signals emitted by the infrared 

detector (D) in response to the infrared rays, characterized 
in that the head objective is formed by a converging 

lens (L
u
) to allow scanning by the scanning device (S) 
with a converging infrared beam, and in that an infrared 

lens (C
i
) is placed between the scanning device (S) and 
an infrared detector (D) in order to focus each point in 

the observed scene on the detector, and in that the 
light-emitting diodes (L) or the diode lasers are placed 

at the focus of a collimating visible lens (C
v
) to allow 
scanning by the scanning device (S) with a parallel-ray 

visible beam. 
Sight according to Claim 1, characterized in that  
 

the second visible/infrared splitter (S
2
) is formed by a 
plane mirror which is pierced-at its centre in order to 

transmit the infrared rays. 
Sight according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the second visible/infrared splitter (S
2
) is formed by a 
plane mirror which is off-centre relative to the infrared 

beam, in order to transmit the infrared rays and reflect 
the visible rays emitted by the light-emitting diode (L) 

towards the scanning device (S). 
Sight according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the second splitter (S
2
) is placed 
in the plane of the intermediate image (I) of the converging 

lens (L
u
) which is obtained at the output of the 
scanning device (S). 
Sight according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the intermediate image (I) is taken 

up by the infrared lens (C
i
) to be focused on the infrared 
detector (D). 
Sight according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that it comprises a visible path composed 

of the collimating visible lens (C
v
) and an afocal 
device (R
1
) of magnification (G
v
) for making the pupil 
(P) of the scanning device intricate with the input pupil 

of a viewer (V), the magnification (G
v
) being designed so 
that the total magnification of the infrared sight is 

one. 
Sight according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the converging lens (L
u
) is made of 
germanium. 
Sight according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the scanning device (S) is formed 

by two oscillating mirrors (T, G), respectively articulated 
on two axes crossed at 90Â° to each other.
