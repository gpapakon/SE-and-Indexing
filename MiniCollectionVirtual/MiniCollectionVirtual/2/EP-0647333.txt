<ABSTRACT>
A device for encapsulating and passivating integrated control circuits in flat screens. The device comprises a sealing bead (4) and optionally an opaque material blocking the photoconductivity of the components of the active matrix (1) which acts as a spacer and optionally as a Black matrix. Said sealing bead or said opaque material is used for the encapsulation and/or the passivation of the integrated control circuits in the flat screen.

<CLAIMS>
Encapsulated and passivated electronic circuits (2, 10,
11, 12) produced on a substrate plate (3) on which an

active matrix (1) controlling electro-optical cells is
also produced, and containing an opaque layer (16) which

suppresses the conductivity of the components of the
active matrix (1) and which acts as a spacer and if

necessary also as a "black matrix", characterised in that
this layer (16) is arranged is such as way as to

encapsulate and passivate said electronic circuits (2, 10,
11, 12).
Electronic circuits according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the encapsulating and passivating layer (16) is

deposited onto the circuits (2, 10, 11, 12) and completely
covers them.
Electronic circuits according to any one of Claims 1 and
2, characterised in that the substrate plate (3) contains

a sealing bead (7, 8) deposited around the circuit (2) and
provides encapsulation.
Electronic circuits according to Claim 3, characterised in
that the sealing bead (7, 8) is deposited either side of

the circuit (2) so as to form a sealed enclosure.
Electronic circuits according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the electronic circuit (2, 

10, 11, 12) is an integrated driver circuit for the active
matrix (1) of a liquid crystal or plasma display.
Electronic circuits according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the substrate plate (3) on

which the electronic circuits (2, 10, 11, 12) are produced
is a transparent material.
Electronic circuits according any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the basic component used in

the electronic circuit or circuits (2, 10, 11, 12) is a
transistor or a diode.
Electronic circuits according any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the semiconductor material

used in the electronic circuit or circuits (2, 10, 11, 12)
is amorphous or polycrystalline silicon or cadmium

selenide.
