<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR SEPARATION OF WET PARTICLESFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a process and apparatus for separating particles in a slurry where the particles possess different physical, magnetic and/or chemical properties. More particularly, the process and apparatus is very effective in separating liquid hydrocarbons from water which may contain solids, such as in oil separated from tar sands and in newsprint pulp separated from ink, and separation of one or more solids from liquids, separation of mineral ores which may be of ferri-, ferro- and/or para-magnetic properties. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Flotation systems are important unit operations in process engineering technology that were developed to separate particulate constituents from slurries. Flotation is a process whereby air is bubbled through a suspension of finely dispersed particles, and the hydrophobic particles are separated from the remaining slurry by attachment to the air bubbles. The air bubble/particle aggregate, formed by adhesion of the bubble to the hydrophobic particles, is generally less dense than the slurry, thus causing the aggregate to rise to the surface of the flotation vessel. Separation of the hydrophobic particles is therefore accomplished by separating the upper layer of the slurry which is in the form of a froth or foam, from the remaining liquid.The fundamental step in froth flotation involves air bubble/particle contact for a sufficient time to allow the particle to rupture the air-liquid film and thus establish attachment. The total time required for this process is the sum of contact time and induction time, where contact time is dependent on bubble/particle motion and on the hydrodynamics of the system, whereas induction time is controlled by the surface chemistry properties of the bubble and particle. 

 However, flotation separation has certain limitations that render it inefficient in many applications. Particularly, in the past it has been thought that flotation is not very effective for the recovery of fine particles (less than 10 microns in diameter) . This can be a serious limitation, especially in the separation of fine minerals. An explanation for this low recovery is that the particle's inertia is so small that particle penetration of the air-liquid film is inhibited, thus resulting in low rates of attachment to the bubbles. Furthermore, flotation has never been relied on as a process to effect separation of hydrocarbons in a slurry.A further limitation of conventional

WE CLAIM:
1. A process for separating particles in a slurry based on different physical, magnetic and/or chemical properties of said particles, said slurry including a mixture of solid particles and/or liquid particles which are immiscible in said slurry, said process comprising: i) introducing a stream of said slurry into a cylindrical chamber having a cylindrical inner wall, said chamber being vertically oriented and closed at its lower end and open at its upper end, said stream being introduced near said closed lower end at an .incline end and tangentially of said chamber to develop a spiral flow of said stream along said chamber inner wall toward said open end, ii) introducing said stream in sufficient volume and pressure to develop a vortex in said slurry which extends downwardly from said chamber upper end, iii) introducing air into said stream during at least a portion of its upward travel chamber, said air being introduced to said stream through means located at said chamber inner wall and for developing said air bubbles which move into said stream, iv) said chamber being of a height sufficient to provide a residence time in said chamber which permits a separation of particles on their physical, electrical and/or chemical properties with at least lighter hydrophobic particles combining with air bubbles and moving inwardly towards said vortex and at least heavier particles under influence of centrifugal forces of said spiral flow, moving outwardly towards said chamber inner wall, said stream developing into a whirlpool at said chamber upper end, v) directing said whirlpool stream outwardly at said open end into a catch basin surrounding said open end, said whirlpool stream swirling outwardly as said stream flows into said catch basin having a liquid level 



 proximate said open end to permit said air bubbles to float toward a peripheral edge of said catch basin, vi) separating said floating air bubbles with lighter hydrophobic particles from said heavier particles by collecting outwardly floating air bubbles from an upper zone of said catch basin, while said heavier particles sink downwardly of said catch basin and removing said heavier particles from a lower zone of said catch basin to effect said separation.
