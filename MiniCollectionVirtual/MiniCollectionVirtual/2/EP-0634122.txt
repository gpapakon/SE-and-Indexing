<ABSTRACT>
Provision is made here for a frame (1) to be designed so that it can be adjusted in height with respect to the bed base (2), frame (1) and bed base (2) being associated with each other via guide elements (9) for vertical guidance. For a lifting movement, at least in the region of each of the end faces of the frame (1) a linkage (10) is articulated at one end and the other end is pivotably mounted on the bed base (2). The linkage (10) is pivoted by actuating drive (11) in the opposite direction to the raising of the frame (1) with respect to the bed base (2).
