<ABSTRACT>
Sulfenamides of certain pyrimidines are effective accelerators in the sulfur vulcanization of rubber. These compounds, based on 4-pyrimidine, show improved rates of vulcanizations and cure states compared with 2-pyrimidine sulfenamides and with known accelerators.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to certain pyrimidine 
sulfenamides and to their use in rubber. A number of heterocyclic sulfenamides have been 
well known, as has been their use in the vulcanization 
of rubber. The best known and most widely used are 
based on benzothiazole. Thus, the benzothiazole 
sulfenamides, such as N-t-butyl-2-benzothiazole 
sulfenamide (TBBS) and N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazole 
sulfenamide (CBS) have become standard accelerators of 
vulcanization. Similarly, the thiol derivative, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole 
(MBT) and the disulfide 
derivative, 2,2'-benzothiazole disulfide (MBTS), are 
standards of the industry. To a lesser degree, other N-heterocycles have 
been suggested as the basis for sulfenamides. For 
example, British Patent 795,174 describes a process for 
making a large variety of sulfonamide compounds for use 
as diuretics and antibacterial agents in which the 
sulfenamide equivalent is first made as an intermediate. 
Twenty-six different basic heterocycles are suggested, 
and a wide variety of substituents and fused ring 
variations are included, as well. Similarly, British Patent 1,342,046 discloses a 
process for making heterocyclic sulfenamides, based on 
diazine, triazine and pyridine thiols, encompassing an 
unlimited number of possible compounds, suggested to be 
effective vulcanization accelerators for rubber. Specific heterocyclic sulfenamides based on 2-mercaptopyrimidine 
are disclosed in British Patent 
802,622 and in D'Amico, U. S. Patent 3,839,303. It has now been found that sulfenamides based on 
the 4-pyrimidyl moiety are particularly effective  
 
accelerators for the vulcanization of natural and 
synthetic rubber. Surprisingly, they are considerably 
more active than their isomeric counterparts (the 2-pyrimidine 
sulfenamides of British Patent 802,622 and 
U. S. Patent 3,839,303) in terms of cure rate and extent 
of cure (cure state). 4-Pyrimidine sulfenamides have 
been found to have superior accelerating effect on the 
vulcanization of natural and synthetic rubber, compared 
to the isomeric 2-pyrimidine sulfenamides. The compounds of the present invention when 
utilized as accelerators for curing natural rubber, 
synthetic rubbers such as polybutadiene, EPDM or 
styrene-butadiene rubber, blends of rubbers such as 
natural rubber and polybutadiene, styrene-butadiene 
rubber and polybutadiene, or combinations thereof, 
result in improved cure rates as indicated by t90-t2 
values, t25-t2 values and maximum rate of vulcanization 
(Vmax), better scorch delay, and
