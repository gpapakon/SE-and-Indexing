<ABSTRACT>
Mounting device for electrical switch gear comprising elements of a first type (1) and elements of a second type (2). Each element (1, 2) comprises a rail (3) for fixing electrical switch gear, two uprights (5, 9; 16, 19) perpendicular to the two ends of the rail and two mounting elements (25) extending downwards from the two ends of the rail. The mounting elements (25) are intended to be fixed removably on a flat bottom of a cabinet. It is possible, as required, via complementary locking means (7, 11) rigidly to assemble two elements of the first type (1) and between none and a certain number of elements of the second type (2), configured between the two elements of the first type (1) so as thus to constitute a rigid assembly having a chosen number, at least equal to two, of parallel rails (3).

An electrical switchgear support device, characterized in that it is modular and 
comprises at least two identical elements of a first U-shaped type (1) designed to be 

coupled head-to-tail to one another, each element of the first type comprising : 

a rail of a first type (3), 
a first upright of a first type (5) extending from near one end (6) of the rail of 
the first type perpendicularly to the latter and on one side only with respect to the 

latter and comprising at the level of its free end a first locking means (7), and 
a second upright of a first type (9) extending from near the other end (10) of 
the rail of the first type perpendicularly to the latter and on one side only with respect 

to the latter and comprising at the level of its free end a second locking means (11) 
designed to cooperate in complementary manner with a said first locking means (7) 

of another identical part of the first type. 
The switchgear support device according to claim 1, characterized in that it 
comprises in addition at least one H-shaped element of a second type (2) designed 

to be coupled in intercalary manner between the two identical elements of the first 
type (1), each element of the second type comprising : 


a rail of a second type (3), 
a first upright of a second type (15) extending from near one end (17) of the 
rail of the second type perpendicularly to the latter and on both sides with respect to 

the latter and comprising at the level of one free end a said first locking means (7) 
and at the level of its other free end a said second locking means (11), and 
a second upright of a second type (19) extending from near the other end 
(20) of the rail of the second type perpendicularly to the latter and on both sides with 

respect to the latter and comprising at the level of one free end a said second 
locking means (11) and at the level of its other free end a said first locking means 

(7). 
The support device according to either one of the claims 1 or 2, characterized in 
that each element of the first type (1) comprises in addition, at the level of its first 

upright of the first type (5) and at the level of its second upright of the first type (9), 
respectively an assembly element (25) and another assembly element (25), said 

assembly elements extending perpendicularly both to said uprights of corresponding  
 

first type (5, 9) and to said rail of the first type (3) from said rail of the first type in the 
direction of the rear of said rail of the first type. 
The support device according to either one of the claims 2 or 3, characterized in 
that each element of the second type (2) comprises in addition, at the level of its first 

upright of the second type (15) and at the level of its second upright of the second 
type (19), respectively a said assembly element (25) and another said assembly 

element (25), said assembly elements extending perpendicularly both to said 
uprights of corresponding second type (15, 19) and to said rail of the second type 

(3), from said rail of the second type in the direction of the rear of said rail of the 
second type. 
The support device according to either one of the claims 3 or 4, characterized in 
that it is designed to be fixed onto a back plate (26) of an enclosure which is 

provided with at least two pillars (27) arranged salient with respect to the back plate 
and directed perpendicularly to the back plate towards the inside of the enclosure, in 

that at least two said assembly elements (25) are designed to cooperate respectively 
with said at least two pillars (27), and in that a fast locking means (28) is provided 

between each assembly element (25) and the corresponding pillar (27). 
The support device according to claim 5, characterized in that the assembly 
elements (25) comprise at least one recess (29) designed to slide on the 

corresponding pillar (27). 
The support device according to claim 5, characterized in that said fast locking 
means (28) enables locking of the assembly element on the corresponding pillar to 

be established according to an adjustable position along the pillar, so that the 
distance between said assembly element and said back plate (26) is adjustable. 
The support device according to any one of the claims 5 to 7, characterized in that 
each fast locking means comprises a bistable latch (28) which is fitted in sliding 

manner in said assembly element (25) according to a direction parallel to the back 
plate (26) and which is designed to engage in the corresponding housings (31, 32, 

33) arranged along the corresponding pillar (27).  
 
The support device according to any one of the foregoing claims, characterized in 
that said first locking means (7) is formed in a general manner by a male 

engagement part and in that said second locking means (11) is formed in a general 

manner by a female engagement part fitting said first locking means so as to 
constitute locking by engagement of said two locking means. 
The support device according to any one of the foregoing claims, characterized 
in that each of the elements of the first type (1) and/or of the second type (2) is 

manufactured as a monoblock element. 
The support device according to any one of the foregoing claims, characterized 
in that the rail (3) of the first type overshoots on both sides of said first and second 

uprights of the first type (5, 9). 
The support device according to any one of the claims 2 to 11, characterized in 
that the rail (3) of the second type overshoots on both sides of said first and second 

uprights of the second type (15,19).
