<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor laser 
and a method of manufacturing the same, and more 
particularly to a semiconductor laser which is easy to 
manufacture and a method of manufacturing the same. Conventionally, a technique has been proposed to 
improve the luminous efficiency of radiation of a 
semiconductor laser. Such a prior art technique is 
disclosed, for example, in Japanese Laid-Open Utility Model 
Publication No. 2-92961. FIG. 12 shows a sectional structure of such a prior art 
semiconductor laser. In FIG. 12, a semiconductor laser chip 
80 is formed by stacking in sequence an n-GaAs substrate 82, 
an n-Al0.35Ga0.65As clad layer 83, an undoped GaAs active 
layer 84, a p-Al0.35Ga0.65As clad layer 85 and a p-GaAs 
contact layer 86. An n-side electrode 81 is fixedly 
attached to the n-GaAs substrate 82, and a p-side electrode 
87 is fixedly attached to the p-GaAs contact layer 86. An 
insulating protector coat 91 is fixedly attached to a 
radiant end surface 92 of the semiconductor laser chip 80. 
The insulating protector coat 91 has a projecting convex  
 
lens 91a formed at a portion opposite to the end of the 
active layer 84. With this construction, a laser beam 
emitted from the end of the active layer 84 can be converged 
by the projecting convex lens 91a. Thus, the luminous 
efficiency of radiation can be substantially improved. In the above prior art, however, the active layer 84 is 
not located in the central portion of the semiconductor 
laser chip 80 in the stacking direction thereof but in the 
vicinity of the p-side electrode 87. As seen in FIG. 12, 
the height of the semiconductor laser chip 80 in the 
stacking direction includes a height de of 2 to 20 µm and 
another height ds of 100 to 200 µm. Therefore, it has been 
impossible for the projecting convex lens 91a formed by 
resin dropping to have its optical axis positioned at the 
end of the active layer. Furthermore, design for a 
converging lens and others in an external optical system has 
been complicated.  
 EP-A-0 536 945 discloses a semiconductor laser device wherein 
plural quantum wells are disposed in a central region. The 
semiconductor laser device further comprises a cylindrical 
convex lens which is attached to one of the partially 
reflective surfaces and is adapted for converging a laser beam 
emitted from the active layers. Moreover, WO 86/02491 discloses a dual wavelength structure 
wherein two edge-emitting devices are bonded with p-regions 
adjacent. The bonding medium is a conductive material
