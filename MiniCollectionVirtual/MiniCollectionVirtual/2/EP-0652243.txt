<ABSTRACT>
A technique is described for the preparation of 
conjugated arylene and heteroarylene vinylene polymers 

wherein conversion of the polymer precursor is effected at 
a temperature ranging from 150-300°C in the presence of 

forming gas. Studies have shown that the presence of the 
forming gas suppresses the formation of carbonyl groups, 

so resulting in an enhancement in photoluminescence and 
electroluminescence efficiency of the polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the
preparation of conjugated arylene or heteroarylene
vinylene polymers by thermal conversion of a precursor
polymer in a controlled atmosphere.Recently, significant advances have been made in the
development of solid-state light emitting devices. Among
the most recent discoveries was the discovery that
conjugated polymers are particularly well suited for this
purpose in that they provide excellent charge transport
characteristics and useful quantum efficiencies for
luminescence. The most popular of the materials suitable
for this use is poly (p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) which is
capable of being prepared in the form of a high quality
film which evidences strong photoluminescence in a band
centered near 2.2 eV.Heretofore, synthesis of poly (p-phenylene vinylene)
and its analogs has been commonly effected by preparing a
precursor polymer and thermally converting the precursor
in a vacuum or inert atmosphere to the desired poly (p-phenylene
vinylene). A typical procedure for attaining
this end involves polymerization of a bis sulfonium salt
intermediate, prepared from dichloro p-xylene and
tetrahydrothiophene, in a water-methanol mixture in the
presence of a base and subsequently dialyzing against 
distilled water to remove inorganic salts and unreacted
monomer. The precursor polymer is then recovered,
dissolved in methanol and spin coated upon a suitable
substrate. At this juncture, the precursor is thermally
converted at a temperature ranging from 150-300°C in a
vacuum or in an inert atmosphere comprising argon or
nitrogen to yield the desired poly (p-phenylene vinylene).
This processing sequence is shown in Equation 1.
Although the resultant films have proven to be stable
in air at room temperature and in vacuum at temperatures
less than 300°C, and evidence satisfactory
photoluminescence, certain inherent limitations in the
processing sequence have limited photoluminescence
efficiency. Thus, it has been found that during the
thermal conversion process carbonyl groups are formed.
These groups are known to quench photoluminescence, so
limiting the exploitation of poly (p-phenylene vinylene).
Workers in the art have recognized this limitation and
efforts to minimize carbonyl formation have focused upon
minimizing exposure to oxygen at elevated temperatures by
the use of better vacuum systems and/or the use of argon 
of higher purity.In accordance with the present invention, this prior
art limitation has been effectively obviated by a novel
processing sequence
