<ABSTRACT>
A fixing device (35) includes fixing and pressure 
rollers (13, 15) rotatably supported by the frame (39), 

and a compressible cleaning pad (47) supported by a 
holder (45), which is inserted into and engaged with 

the frame (39). The cleaning pad (47) is in contact 
with a fixing surface (13b) of the fixing roller (13) 

such that the cleaning pad (47) is not compressed when 
the fixing roller (13) is not rotated and is compressed 

to effect the cleaning operation when the fixing roller 
(13) is rotated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fixing device and an electrographic
image forming apparatus according to the preamble of claims 1 and 6.
In particular, the invention relates to a fixing device, which is
used in an image forming apparatus to fix a toner image on a
paper sheet, including a fixing roller, a pressure roller
engaged with the fixing roller and a cleaning pad which is in
contact with the surface of the fixing roller to clean the
surface of the roller.As is well known, a conventional image forming apparatus,
e.g., electro-photo copying machines, laser beam printers,
etc., typically includes an image forming unit for forming an
image on an image carrier, a developing unit for developing
the image, as a visible image, on the image carrier by a toner
powder, and a transfer unit for transferring the developed
image formed on the image carrier to a paper sheet. The image
forming apparatus also includes a fixing unit which fuses the
toner powder (developed image) on the paper sheet and fixes
the fused toner on the paper sheet as a fixed image.A conventional fixing unit is shown in FIGURE 1. A fixing
unit 11 includes a cylindrical fixing roller (heat roller) 13
in which a heater (not shown) is provided at a center portion
along a length thereof. Each side of fixing roller 13 is
rotatably supported by a suitable bearing means, respectively,
and fixing roller 13 is rotated in counter-clockwise by
a motor (not shown). A pressure roller 15 is located below
fixing roller 13 such that it is forcibly engaged with the
surface of fixing roller 13 by a spring (not shown). Thus,
pressure roller 15 is rotated clockwise when fixing roller 
13 is rotated as described above. As shown in FIGURE 1, those
rollers 13 and 15 are rotatably located in a housing 17. A
lead-in opening 17a is opened in one side wall of housing 17
to introduce a paper sheet P into housing 17 and a lead-out
opening 17b is also opened in the opposite side wall to
discharge paper sheet P from housing 17. A cleaning unit 18
is slidably fitted in an opening 21 formed in the upper wall
of housing 17. Cleaning unit 18 has a cleaning pad 19
therein. One end of pad 19 is in contact with the surface of
fixing roller 13 at a prescribed pressure by a suitable
pressing means, e.g., a leaf spring 23. One end of leaf
spring 23 is fixed to an upper openable cover 25 of an image
forming apparatus and the other end is in contact with
cleaning unit 18 to urge cleaning pad 19 on the surface of
fixing roller 13. Leaf spring 23 has relatively a long length
to easily

<CLAIMS>
A fixing device (35) which receives a medium
(P) on which a toner image is supported, comprising:


a frame (39);
an elongated fixing roller (13) rotatably
supported by the frame (39);
an elongate pressure roller (15) rotatably
supported by the frame (39) and forcibly engaged with

the fixing roller (13) to carry out a fixing operation
in which the toner on the medium (P) is fixed;
an elongate cleaning holder (45) detachably
located in the frame (39); and
a compressible cleaning pad (47) supported by the
holder (45), characterised in that:
one elongated surface of the holder is inclined
with respect to the horizontal elongated surface of the

holder;
in that the cleaning pad (47) is supported by the
inclined surface of the holder (45), such that the

surface of the cleaning pad (47) is in contact with a
portion of the surface of the fixing roller (13) at a

first position offset from the position on the surface
of the fixing roller intersected by a vertical line

(VL) passing through the rotational centre (13r) of the
fixing roller (13); and in that
loading means are provided for performing an
engagement of the cleaning holder (45) and the frame

(39) only when said fixing roller (13) is rotated
during a fixing operation such that the holder (45) is

located at a position in the frame (39) in which the
cleaning pad (47) is moved to a cleaning position where

it is forcibly compressed against the surface of the
fixing roller (13) at said second cleaning position.
A device according to claim 1, wherein the
loading means includes a pair of projections (43a, 43b)

respectively formed at opposite elongated ends (45a, 45b) of the 
holder (45) and the frame (39) includes a pair of

engaging portions (39a, 39b) corresponding to the pair
of projections (43a, 43b).
A device according to claim 2, wherein the
cleaning holder (45) includes means (51) for loosely

maintaining the engagement of the cleaning holder (45)

and the frame (39) while the fixing roller (13) is not

A device according to claim 3, wherein the
maintaining means includes a leaf plate (51) one end of

which is fixed to one of the elongated ends (45a) of the
holder (45) so that the holder (45) is urged in the

elongated direction by the leaf plate (51) when the
holder is located in the frame (39).
