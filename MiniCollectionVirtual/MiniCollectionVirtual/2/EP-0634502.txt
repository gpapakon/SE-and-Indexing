<ABSTRACT>
Process for metallising a surface of a piece of sintered alumina with a metal layer which adheres strongly to said surface, including the irradiation of the surface to be metallised with a beam of light emitted by an excimer laser source and the immersion of the laser-treated alumina piece in a bath containing autocatalytic metal for cladding, by means of an autocatalytic plating, the abovementioned laser-treated surface with the metal present in the bath, this process additionally including the heat-treatment of the metallised piece at a temperature which is raised sufficiently to induce diffusion of metal from the metal layer formed during the immersion into the piece of alumina, and metallised product thus obtained.

Process for plating the surface of a sintered 
alumina part with a layer of metal which is strongly 

adhesive to said surface, this process comprising 
irradiation of the surface to be plated with a beam of 

light emitted by an excimer laser source, and immersion 
of the alumina part treated by the laser in a bath 

containing an electroless metal for covering, by means of 
electroless plating, the surface treated by the said 

laser, with the metal contained in the bath, this process 
being characterised in that it comprises hot treatment of 

the plated part to a temperature sufficiently high to 
induce a diffusion of metal from the metallic layer 

formed during immersion, into the alumina part. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the laser source used is an excimer laser source 

providing an energy density on the irradiated alumina 
part which is sufficient to cause the irradiated zones of 

the surface of the said part to melt. 
Process according to claim 2, characterised in that, 
after an interruption in the abovementioned laser 

irradiation, and hardening of the superficial melted 
zones of the above mentioned part, a fine layer of phase γ 

of alumina is obtained on the surface of the irradiated  
 

part of sintered alumina, this fine layer of phase γ 
having a thickness at least equal to 20 nanometers, above 

a phase α of textured alumina which can reach a depth of 
1 micrometer in the alumina part. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the electroless bath contains 

metallic atoms usable in an electroless solution. 
Process according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the metallic atoms which are deposited electrolessly on 

the irradiated zones on the alumina part are selected 
from the group comprising chromium, manganese, iron, 

cobalt, nickel, copper, arsenic and selenium. 
Process according to any one of claims 3 to 5, 
characterised in that the plated part is heated to 

temperature sufficient to cause diffusion of the metal in 
the phase γ of alumina. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that it allows induction of synthesis of 

a ternary compound comprising atoms of the diffused 
metal, strongly coupled to atoms of oxygen and aluminium 

in order to form ionic or covalent links.
