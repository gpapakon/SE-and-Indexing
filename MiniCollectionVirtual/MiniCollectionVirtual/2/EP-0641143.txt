<ABSTRACT>
In a method for simulating the sound and/or listening impression at a representative listening location, the room impulse response h(n) is determined separately for the left ear and the right ear. In this connection it is irrelevant whether the room is an actually existing real room or a virtual room. Of the room impulse response h(n) determined, only those components which are determining for the sound impression are used, that is to say components of the room impulse response h(n) which are smaller than a predetermined threshold are ignored. This considerably simplifies the circuit complexity for convoluting the electroacoustic signal to be reproduced with the relevant room impulse response.

Method of simulating a space impression and/or sound impression occurring at a
representative listening position in a room during monophonic, stereophonic or multichannel

reproduction, in which

a room is selected whose spatial sound is to be simulated,
the position of the representative listening position is specified within the room,
the associated spatial pulse response is determined at the representative listening position at
least for one channel,
a threshold value extending over at least a portion of the length of the spatial pulse response
determined is specified for the spatial pulse response determined,
by comparing the spatial pulse response determined with the threshold value, a reduced
spatial pulse response is generated that has, within the portion of the length of the spatial

pulse response determined, only those parts of the spatial pulse response determined at

which the instantaneous amplitude is above the threshold value, whereas the reduced spatial
pulse response is set to the value zero for those parts of the spatial pulse response

determined whose instantaneous amplitude is below the threshold, and the spatial pulse
response determined outside the portion of the length contains the spatial pulse response

determined in unaltered form.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
, with the exception of that region
of the spatial pulse response determined that corresponds to the primary sound, the portion

comprises all the remaining temporal duration of the spatial pulse response determined.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the portion comprises the entire
temporal duration of the spatial pulse response determined.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the threshold value is a
dynamically variable threshold value that has a permanently specified minimum value and 
in
that
 the threshold value is boosted in the direction of higher values by a half oscillation of
the spatial pulse response determined, which half oscillation exceeds the applicable

threshold value in each case or the minimum limit value and, after boosting, gradually
decays to its minimum value.
Method according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the threshold value decays
according to an exponential function.
Method according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the threshold value is specified in
accordance with a psychoacoustic masking effect.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the threshold value is fixed.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the threshold value varies in a
stepped fashion.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the selected room is a theoretical
or virtual room and 
in that
 the respective spatial pulse response determined is a spatial pulse
response calculated on the basis of the assumptions relating to the shape of the room, the 

position of the sound source, the listening position, the direction of the sound wave and/or
the orientation of the head.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the selected room is a room that
actually exists and 
in that
 the respective spatial pulse response determined has been
measured in the real room.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 it is performed for at least two
different listening channels.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 an audio signal is convoluted
with the reduced spatial pulse response.
Device, 
characterized in that
 it contains an electronic circuit in which the reduced
spatial pulse response is programmed in accordance with the method according to one of the

above claims, and 
in that
 the circuit has one or more inputs for injecting a monophonic,
stereophonic or multi-channel audio programme, at least one channel and also at least one

audio output per channel at which a processed audio program is outputted that is obtained by
convolution of the injected audio program with the reduced spatial pulse response(es)

assigned to the particular channel.
Device according to Claim 13, 
characterized in that
 it contains per channel at least
one FIR filter whose filter coefficients correspond to the amplitude values of the reduced

spatial pulse response digitized using a specified sampling frequency.
