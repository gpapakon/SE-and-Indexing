<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an impact resistant
transparent resin laminate comprising a methacrylate resin plate
and a polycarbonate resin plate which are bonded with a bisphenol
type epoxy resin base soft polymer.An impact resistant transparent plate is used as a
glazing member in public or athletic facilities, a screen on a counter
of a bank and the like, or a glazing member of a door or various vehicles,
and a wide variety of impact resistant transparent plates are
known.Among them, as an impact resistant transparent plate
which protects human life from a bullet which generates a strong
impact in a limited area, there are exemplified a transparent plate
made of a single material such as a silicate glass plate or a transparent
polycarbonate resin plate, a transparent laminate comprising
at least one of a silicate glass plate and a transparent methacrylate
resin plate and a transparent polycarbonate resin plate which are
bonded with a methacrylate base syrup (see Japanese Patent KOKAI
Publication No. 100515/1977), a transparent laminate comprising at
least two polycarbonate resin plates which are bonded with at least
one intermediate layer of a thermoplastic polyurethane resin which
is a reaction product of a polyisocyanate and a polyester diol (see
Japanese Patent Publication No. 12520/1984 and Japanese Patent 
KOKAI Publication Nos. 301448/1992 and 361034/1992), and the
like. DE-U-8633539 discloses transparent laminates to be used
in police helmets, comprising a layer of an acrylic
glass, a layer of polycarbonate, and a layer of an epoxy
resin therebetween. 
WO-A-8000943 discloses improved impact or shock resistant
laminates comprising a plurality of laminae including
a polycarbonate laminate and at least one acrylic
resin laminate, said laminae being adhered by means of
an epoxy adhesive. But, the conventional impact resistant transparent plates
do not necessarily have a sufficient protection property against a
high performance gun and the like. When they are used, for example,
as a bulletproof shield, their thickness should be increased to improve
the impact resistance. The increase of the thickness will cause
some problems such as the increase of weight in practical use.One object of the present invention is to provide a transparent
resin laminate which has a sufficient protection property
against a high performance gun and the like.Another object of the present invention is to provide a
transparent resin laminate which has a good protection property
when it is made thin to decrease its
