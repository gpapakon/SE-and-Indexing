<ABSTRACT>
The set of structural parts exhibits at least two plates (6, 7, 8) which are to be connected to one another laterally in a water-tight manner. For the rapid and sealed connection of the plates (6, 7, 8), an upwardly open U-profile flange (13) and an elastomeric sealing strip (15) are, furthermore, provided on the mutually facing sides of the plates (6, 7, 8), which sealing strip (15) exhibits two parallel ribs (16) which can be pressed into the flanges (13) with elastic compression.

Set of components for producing the base of a
plant pallet (5) with at least two panels (6, 7, 8) which

are to be connected to one another such that they are
watertight at the sides, characterized by upwardly open

U-profile flanges (13) which are provided on the mutually
facing sides (12) of the panels (6, 7, 8), said sides

being drawn downwards and forming border regions (12)
which are integrally formed on the panels, and by an

elastomeric sealing strip (15) which has two parallel
ribs (16) which can be forced, with elastic compression,

into the flanges (13).
Set of components according to Claim 1, characterized
in that, between the two ribs (16) mentioned

above, the sealing strip (15) has a third rib (16), which
spaces apart the flanges (13) of two adjacent panels (6,

7, 8).
Set of components according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the flanks of the ribs (16) have

lamella-forming longitudinal grooves (17) with a sawtooth
profile, such that the lamellae are positioned against

the rib (16) when the sealing strip (15) is forced into
the flanges (13) and spread out in a barb-like manner

when the sealing strip (15) is removed.
Plant pallet (5) with a carrying frame (9) into
which there is inserted a base produced by the set of

components according to one of Claims 1 to 3.
Plant pallet according to Claim 4, characterized
in that those borders of the panels (6, 7, 8) which are

adjacent to the frame (9) are drawn upwards on the frame 
(9).
Plant pallet according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized
in that, between the two ribs (16) mentioned

above, the sealing strip (15) has a third rib (16), which
spaces apart the flanges (13).
Plant pallet according to one of Claims 4 to 6,
characterized in that the flanks of the ribs (16) have

lamella-forming longitudinal grooves (17) with a sawtooth
profile, such that the lamellae are positioned against

the ribs (16) when the sealing strip (15) is forced into
the flange and spread out in a barb-like manner when the

sealing strip (15) is removed.
Plant pallet according to one of Claims 4 to 7
having watering channels provided in the panels (6, 7,

8), characterized in that the top side of the sealing
strip (15) is flush with the base of the watering channels.
