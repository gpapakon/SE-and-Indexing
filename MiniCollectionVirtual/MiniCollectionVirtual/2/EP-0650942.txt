<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hydraulic mortar as a two-component system for producing a composite body, in particular for anchoring fastening elements. To achieve easy mixing of the components in the drilled hole or in a static mixer of a two-chamber cartridge, an alkali-resistant, free-radical-curable resin is mixed into the hydraulic binder. This addition produces a system which not only has good flow behaviour and miscibility of the components, but also makes possible a shortening of the curing time of the composite body.
