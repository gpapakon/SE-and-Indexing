<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a self-cross-linked polyvinyl butyral 
(PVB) binder for OPC's. The non-cross-linked form of the 

binder is available from Monsanto Co. in the U.S.A. as 

Butvar™
, and from Sakisiu Chemical Co. in Japan as 
Slek™
. 
I discovered that the PVB may be self-cross-linked by 

subjecting it to just a thermal cure at between about 
150°-300°C for about 2 hours. I think other ways of 

cross-linking, for example, L-beam, UV or X-ray radiation, 
will achieve results sim
ilar to those I obtained with 
heat. No cross-linker, nor cross-linkable copolymer nor 

catalyst is required to accomplish the cross-linking. 
After self-cross-linking, the PVB has good mechanical 
durability and good anti-solvent characteristics. In 

addition, the self-cross-linked PVB's glass transition 
temperature (T
g
) increases from about 65°C to about 170°C. 
Also, when conventional photoconductor pigments are dispersed 

in the self-cross-linked PVB, they are well dispersed, 
and the resulting OPC's have good charge acceptance, 

low dark decay, and in general, good photodischarge 
characteristics. Also, OPC's with the self-cross-linked 

PVB exhibited improved adhesion, so multi-layered OPC's 
made according to this invention will have improved interlayer 

bonding and longer economic lives.

<DESCRIPTION>
Technical Field. This invention relates generally to photoconductors for electrophotography. The invention is a
positive charging, organic photoconductor material with good speed and stability, as well as improved adhesion for
multi-layer photoconductors for dry and liquid toner electrophotography.Related Art. In electrophotography, a latent image is created on the surface of photoconducting material by selectively
exposing areas of the charged surface to light. A difference in electrostatic charge density is created between
the areas on the surface exposed and unexposed to light. The visible image is developed by electrostatic toners containing
pigment components and thermoplastic components. The toners are selectively attracted to the photoconductor
surface either exposed or unexposed to light, depending on the relative electrostatic charges of the photoconductor
surface, development electrode and the toner. The photoconductor may be either positively or negatively charged, and
the toner system similarly may contain negatively or positively charged particles. For laser printers, the preferred embodiment
is that the photoconductor and toner have the same polarity, but different levels of charge.A sheet of paper or intermediate transfer medium is then given an electrostatic charge opposite that of the toner
and passed close to the photoconductor surface, pulling the toner from the photoconductor surface onto the paper or
intermediate medium, still in the pattern of the image developed from the photoconductor surface. A set of fuser rollers
fixes the toner to the paper, subsequent to direct transfer, or indirect transfer when using an intermediate transfer
medium, producing the printed image.The important photoconductor surface, therefore, has been the subject of much research and development in the
electrophotography art. A large number of photoconductor materials have been disclosed as being suitable for the
electrophotographic photoconductor surface. For example, inorganic compounds such as amorphous silicon (Si), arsenic
selenite (As2Se3), cadmium sulfide (CdS), selenium (Se), titanium oxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) function as
photoconductors. However, these inorganic materials do not satisfy modern requirements in the electrophotography
art of low production costs, high-speed response to laser diode or other light-emitting-diode (LED), and safety from
non-toxicity.Therefore, recent progress in the electrophotography art with the photoconductor surface has been made with
organic materials as
