<ABSTRACT>
A method of making a tool which is useful in the manufacture of articles, using computer aided modelling (CAM) apparatus and wherein a two-dimensional, or three-dimensional representation of the desired tool is converted by said apparatus into machine readable input data, said data is read into a memory of said apparatus, and subsequently interpreted by modelling apparatus which is a part of said CAM apparatus to form a model for the tool from a suitable material, characterised in that the said model for the tool is formed as a mould and the required tool is cast directly from said mould using a solid-forming, curable composition which exhibits substantial dimensional stability at temperatures up to 500  DEG C.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CAD/CAM PRODUCTIOM TOOL FABRICATIONThis invention relates to methods of producing components, such as tools for mass production of articles, from materials by processes such as moulding, vacuum forming, casting, press forming and the like. It has principal application in CAD/CAM engineering i.e. computer aided design and computer aided modelling.Production tools are used for volume product ifacture, i.e. mass production, for example press forming. It is well known to machine the tool, using relatively laborious and expensive processes, frequently from models generated by commercially available NCAD/CAM" systems. For example one such known NCAD/CAMn system is the MASTERCAM system sold by Unimatic. In the course of making a tool, information contained in an initial drawing is interpreted by the CAD/CAM system, specifically to produce a model (from associated hardware) in a relatively soft material such as wood or plastics. Because production tools should have specific physical properties, such as desirable values of hardness and/or temperature resistance, they are usually made from a quite different material than the soft material of the model. It is the process of transferring the features of the model to the tool, which is generally 

the most laborious and expensive part of the tool production process.We have now surprisingly found that models obtainable by the aforementioned commercially available CAD/CAM systems, when fabricated as moulds from suitable materials, can serve as a direct mould to form the desired production tool, from a large range of materials. The main advantage is that previous machining steps employed in the fabrication of mass production tools, can be eliminated with consequent reduction in labour and material costs.According to this invention there is provided a method of making a tool which is useful in the manufacture of articles, using computer aided modelling (CAM) apparatus and wherein a two-dimensional, or three-dimensional representation of the desired tool is converted by said apparatus into machine readable input data, said data is read into a memory of said apparatus, and subsequently interpreted by modelling apparatus which is a part of said CAM apparatus to form a model for the tool from a suitable material, characterised in that the said model for.the tool is formed as a mould and the required tool is cast directly from said mould using a solid-forming, curable composition which exhibits substantial dimensional stability at temperatures up to 500°C.
