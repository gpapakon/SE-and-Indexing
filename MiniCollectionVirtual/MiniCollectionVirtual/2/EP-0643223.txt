<ABSTRACT>
For gear pumps in particular, a shaft gland is proposed which, as seen from the plain bearing (journal, sleeve bearing) annulus or a relief chamber (M), is equipped firstly with a labyrinth seal (17) having a screw conveying direction directed towards the chamber (M) and then a sealing-fluid sealing stage (7). To ensure the sealing effect, the circulated sealing fluid (S) serves as a cooling medium (coolant) for those zones of the labyrinth seal (17), which are situated on the external side of the shaft.

Process for sealing a shaft passage in a medium-filled
chamber, in which the pressure changes as a function of the

shaft rotation speed (n) and where the medium has a
temperature-dependent viscosity (η), in which starting from

the chamber (M), first a seal (3) acting as a function of
rotation speed is applied followed by a blocking fluid seal

(7) independent of rotation speed, characterized in that by
circulation of the blocking fluid of the blocking fluid

seal (7), this fluid is used as a heat transport medium and
the adjacent area at the rotation speed-dependent seal (3)

thus cooled such that there, largely independent of the
rotation speed, a seal is achieved on the basis of the

viscosity change of the medium resulting from the cooling.
Shaft passage in a chamber for a medium in which the medium
pressure changes as a function of the shaft rotation speed,

where the viscosity (η) of the medium decreases as the
temperature rises, in which starting from chamber (M),

first a labyrinth seal (17) with a threaded conveyor device
(F) towards the chamber (M) is fitted followed by a

blocking fluid seal (7), characterized in that a flow line
system (29, 27) for the blocking fluid is provided such

that this also acts as a coolant for the adjacent area of
the labyrinth seal.
Shaft passage according to claim 2, characterized in that
the blocking fluid seal comprises at least one ring (19)

arranged on the shaft (1) with radial bores expanding
axially on the outside which communicate with at least one

supply line and at least one extractor line (27, 29) for
the blocking fluid (S) on the housing side, where the axial

expansion of the enlargements (23) allows an axial
displacement of the ring (19) in relation to the said lines

(27, 29). 
Shaft passage according to claim 3, characterized in that
axially on both sides of the ring are provided sealing

elements (31) lying on the shaft, preferably stuffing box
packing or lip seals.
Shaft passage according to any of claims 2 to 4,
characterized in that the labyrinth seal (17) and blocking

fluid seal (7) are arranged on an insert (33) which can be
removably attached to a housing (33).
Shaft passage according to any of claims 2 to 5,
characterized in that a thermosyphon circulation circuit

for the blocking fluid (S) is provided or a circulation
device for this, preferably formed by an external pump

and/or circulation elements on the shaft (1) in the area of
the blockin
g fluid seal (7).
Gear pump with at least one shaft passage according to any
of claims 2 to 6.
Use of a gear pump according to claim 7 to transport
polymer melts.
