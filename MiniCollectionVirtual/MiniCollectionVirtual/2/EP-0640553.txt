<ABSTRACT>
A direct drive wheel to handrail contact drive 
assembly utilizes a pair of drive rollers (30) which 

contact the handrail (6) directly. The drive rollers are 
powered by a single drive shaft (22). A pair of pressure 

rollers (44) oppose the drive rollers so as to press the 
handrail against the drive rollers. The pressure rollers 

are spring biased against the handrail. The drive assembly 
is used to drive the handrail of an escalator or moving 

walkway.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a drive assembly for 
moving the handrail of an escalator or moving walkway, 
and more particularly, to a drive assembly utilizing 
drive rollers which directly contact the handrail. Handrails on escalators and moving walkways are 
moved by drive systems which typically are positioned 
along the return path of travel of the handrail, and 
which typically engage the handrail in some sort of nip 
through which the handrail passes. The drive system may 
include a plurality of friction rollers forming the 
drive nip; or drive belts; or a combination of belts and 
rollers. The drive system will typically include a 
powered component and a reaction or pressure component, 
both of which can be either a roll or a belt. Some of the prior art handrail drive systems will 
create a constant nip pressure on the handrail; and 
others operate in such a manner as to create a variable 
nip pressure, which is proportional to the frictional 
drag imparted to the hand-rail by changes in the number 
of passengers on the conveyor, or the like. Ideally, the handrail drive system should be 
capable of being adjusted so as to be able to produce a 
variety of nip pressures; and should provide enhanced 
contact with the handrail for increased driving power. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,414,109 Clark, granted December 
3, 1968; 3,666,075 Iwata, granted May 30, 1972; 
4,134,883 Mendelsohn, et al., granted January 16, 1979; 
4,151,903 Takahashi, et al., granted May 1, 1979; and 
4,200,177 Sato, et al., granted April 29, 1980 are 
typical prior art disclosures of passenger conveyor 
handrail drives. Viewed from one aspect the present invention 
provides a handrail drive assembly in combination with  
 
an escalator or moving walkway passenger conveyor, said 
drive assembly comprising: 
a) a plurality of powered drive rollers 
positioned along a path of travel of the 
handrail for driving engagement with the 
handrail; b) at least one powered drive shaft for providing 
drive power to the drive assembly; c) means operably connecting the or each said 
drive shaft to more than one of said drive 
rollers so that each drive shaft powers two 
drive rollers; d) a plurality of reaction rollers positioned 
along said path of travel of the handrail, 
each of said reaction rollers cooperating with 
a respective drive roller to provide a 
plurality of drive nips through which the 
handrail passes; e) a single spring means for providing a nip 
pressure bias force for each nip in said drive 
assembly; and f) flexible means
