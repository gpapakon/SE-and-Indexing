<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to certain 1-herbicidal compositions 
containing, as active ingredient, 1-phenyl pyrazolidindiones, and 
their use as herbicides to combat undesired plant growth. Certain derivatives of pyrazolidin-3,5-dione (and its 
tautomeric forms) are known to affect plant growth. Thus, European 
Patent Application 508126 describes 3-hydroxy-4-aryl-5-oxo-pyrazolidine 
derivatives having alkyl, alkenyl or aryl substituents 
at the 1-position; such compounds being active against ecto 
parasites and also certain plant species. European Patent 
Application 0265305 claims herbicidally active 3-substituted 
pyrazol-5-ones whose synthesis proceeds via pyrazolidin-3,5-diones 
having hydrogen or alkyl at the 4-position, these intermediates not 
being described as possessing any herbicidal activity themselves. 
PCT patent specification WO 92/16510 describes 
pyrazolidin-3,5-diones substituted at the 4-position with a phenyl, 
pyridine or naphthalene group, and at the 1-(and/or 2-) position 
with an acyclic hydrocarbon group, those compounds being active 
against insects, mites and certain plant species. It has now been found that particularly useful herbicidal 
activity is present in pyrazolidindiones bearing a phenyl 
substituent at the 1-position and an optionally substituted, 
non-aromatic hydrocarbon substituent at the 4-position, certain of 
such compounds being known perse in the above literature. Accordingly, the present invention provides a herbicidal 
composition comprising a carrier and/or surface-active agent 
together with, as active ingredient, a 1-phenyl pyrazolidindione of 
general formula I-:  wherein R¹ represents an optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, 
alkynyl, cycloalkyl or aralkyl group;
 
R² represents a halogen atom, a formyl, carboxy, azido, nitro or 
cyano group, an optionally substituted alkoxy, alkylthio, 
alkenyloxy, alkenylthio, alkynyloxy, alkynylthio, cycloalkoxy, 
cycloalkylthio, alkylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, amino, alkylamino or 
dialkylamino group, or one of the meanings given for R¹ ; m 
represents 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 and when m is greater than 1 each group 
R² may be the same or different;
 
together with salts of such compounds, and tautomers thereof. An alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl radical or moiety may be a 
straight or branched chain group. Generally an alkyl radical or 
moiety has from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 6, 
carbon atoms. Alkenyl and alkynyl radicals or moieties suitably 
have from 2 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably from 2 to 8, especially 
from
