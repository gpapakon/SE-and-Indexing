<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention regards a wall structure provided with modular and repeated
fastening means to which can be clamped means cooperating to form the fitting out
of a shop, such as for example, shelves, brackets, hangers, displayers and the like.In the practice of fitting shop-windows, shops and the like are largely used equipped
walls suitable to house fitting means such as brackets, shelves, hanging means,
cantilever beams and the like having the purpose to show the exibited goods.These equipped walls could be prepared time-by-time, according to specific
requirements, through craftman methods, involving high costs and causing a general
propension to pospone any changement, because said changement could require such
money and time expenses to be justified only by absolute need.Many times it happens, in buildings housing shows, exibitions, or markets, that the
same room must house, within a short time, the exhibition of goods and articles so
different in nature to require substantial fitting differences.As a consequence, there is the need of having readily available equipped walls, of modular
kind, on which it is possible to operate changements both of backgrounds and
fittings through fast and simple operations asking for a minimum of tools, or better,
for none specific tool.GB-A-1,023,074 discloses a bracket support structure having utility for
supporting shelving of the kind used in super markets for displaying food and
other articles either along walls or in the middle of the floor. Such a structure
works rather well, but is limited to the support, at presettable heights, of
shelving planes, not having the possiblity to replace the shelving planes with
other support means, as for example hangers usable in cloth and fabric shops.The above mentioned need is satified using an equipped wall structure
comprising a metallic frame including at least two parallel aligned uprights,
defining a vertical plane, each of said uprights being interconnected with the
contiguous upright by at least two crossbars and at least a panel of wood, or like
materials, being seated between each assembly consisting of said at least two
uprights and at least two crossbars, characterized in that said crossbars have a
"T" shaped section provided wit a head and a leg, the head being vertically
arranged and fastened to both the uprights by means of per se known fastening
means and the leg being horizontally arranged, the leg being greater in length
than the thickness of said panel having two opposite edges respectively resting
agai
