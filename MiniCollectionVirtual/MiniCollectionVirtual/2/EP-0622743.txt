<ABSTRACT>
A computer having a file management system and a 
plurality of objects organized in folders is presented. The 

file management system allows for the automatic maintenance of 
folders. A query basis is created for each folder, the basis 

consisting of a description of contents of folder. That is, 
the query basis describes the criteria for those objects which 

are to be included as contents of the folder. Upon a pre-specified 
interval or trigger event, the contents of the 

folder are updated by the file management system 
automatically. This relieves the user of the task of "filing" 

relevant objects in a folder and insures that the contents of 
a folder are, at any moment, complete and up to date.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the management of data 
within a computer system. More specifically, this invention 
relates to an improved method and apparatus for managing 
objects within a computer system by automating the manner in 
which they are organized into subsets or folders. Managing information is an endemic problem to any type of 
computer system. Generically, the challenge is to organize 
objects of various types in a way that provides simple access 
and use. The problem can be illustrated by considering the 
challenges facing office automation. Office automation is a general term which is used for a 
variety of computer applications which enable organizations to 
manage their information. Applications which allow businesses 
to store and retrieve correspondence and reports 
electronically, distribute documents electronically, integrate 
data files with text, and generally support the day-to-day 
activities of office personnel fall under this umbrella term. As in non-automated environments, the automated office 
has a need to organize the documents in a manner that allows 
for easy retrieval and a clustering of like information in a 
single place so that a user who has to work on the information 
has all the relevant information quickly and easily. In non-automated 
environments, this was often achieved by the user 
filing related documents in a single cardboard folder which 
was then kept in a desk or file cabinet. The cost of such 
organization in filing effort and filing time could be 
considerable. Further, the system was not infallible: filing 
backlogs could result in a critical document not being in a 
folder when a user referenced it. In addition, manual 
misfiles could occur.  The organizational requirement remains in the electronic 
office. The most primitive techniques used to "file" 
electronic documents are partitioned data sets (PDS) and 
directories. Partitioned data sets are storage areas on the 
storage medium. Documents are filed in the PDS in the order 
created and there is no other relationship regarding the order 
of the documents. Directories are similar to partitioned data 
sets in that they are physical storage areas for documents or 
files. Documents contained in a directory have no logical 
organization except that implied by their presence in the 
particular directory. In both schemes, if a user wanted a 
document pertaining to a specific topic, the user would need 
to first identify the PDS or directory in which such documents 
were filed and then sequentially

<CLAIMS>
A method for creating query folders stored in an 
interactive information handling system, said system 

comprising a workstation with a display used by an end 
user, said system containing a plurality of objects and a 

plurality of folders, said query folders being 
automatically maintained, said method comprising the 

steps of: 
identifying a first set of criteria; 

displaying on a screen, a screen image to permit an end 
user to enter a said first set of criteria; 

associating said first set of criteria with a first query 
folder; 

selecting from a plurality of objects a first set of 
objects, said set containing each object which satisfies 

said first set of criteria; 
associating said first set of objects with said first 

query folder; 
identifying a set of update conditions, said conditions 

being those conditions under which an update of said 
first query folder will be initiated; 

associating said set of update conditions with said first 
query folder; 

upon an occurrence of one or more of said set of update 
conditions, initiating an update of said first query 

folder to be performed by said system. 
A method as in claim 1, wherein upon said update of said 
first query folder, a timestamp of said update is 

associated with said first query folder. 
A method as in claim 1, wherein said update is comprised 
of verifying that all objects in said first set of 

objects still satisfy said first set of criteria, 
deleting each object in said first set of objects which 

does not satisfying said first set of criteria, and 
adding into said first said of objects, each object from 

said plurality of objects which satisfies said first 
criteria. 
A method as in claim 1, wherein one of said update 
conditions comprises the condition that a user accesses 

said first folder. 
A method as in claim 1, wherein said first set of 
criteria may be modified by entering said modification 

into said system through said keyboard. 
A method as in claim 5, wherein one of said update 
conditions comprises the condition that said first set of 

criteria has been modified.
