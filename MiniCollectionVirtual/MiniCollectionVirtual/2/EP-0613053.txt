<ABSTRACT>
Hitherto, plastics have been removed from metallic microstructures by irradiation and, if necessary, subsequent treatment with solvents, by aggressive solvents or treatment at elevated temperatures; this can impair the quality of the microstructures, or the microstructure can be considerably modified or destroyed. The novel process allows the plastics to be removed under gentle conditions. The metallic microstructure is treated with a high-boiling fluid at above 140@C for from 10 to 90 minutes and subsequently rinsed with water. Suitable fluids are oligomers of ethylene glycol, short-chain diols or dicarboxylic acid esters. Such fluids do not attack the metal and do not allow swelling of the plastics to be removed. The production of metallic microstructures and the casting of microstructure elements from plastic by means of metallic microstructures can be carried out using plastics which are desirable per se, but which can only be used to a limited extent, or not at all, if the novel process is not used.

A process for removing plastics material from a 
metallic microstructure element, characterised by 


treatment of the metallic microstructure element 
at a temperature above 140°C with a fluid which 

does not swell the plastics material and whose 
boiling point (at atmospheric pressure) is above 

130°C. 
A process according to claim 1 for removing fusible 
plastics material from a metallic microstructure 

element, characterised by 

treatment of the metallic microstructure element 
with a fluid which does not swell the plastics 

material, the treatment being performed at a 
temperature which 


is in the range from 20 degrees below to 100 
degrees above the melting point of the 

plastics material and 
simultaneously in the range from 50 degrees 
below the boiling point to the boiling point 

of the fluid. 
A process according to claim 1 for removing infusible 
plastics material from a metallic microstructure 

element, characterised by 

treatment of the metallic microstructure element 
at a temperature above 140°C with a fluid which 

does not swell the plastics material. 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised by 


treatment of the metallic microstructure element 

in the liquid phase or the vapour phase of the 
fluid which does not swell the plastics material, 

optionally at superatmospheric pressure. 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised by 


treatment of the metallic microstructure element 
in the liquid phase of the fluid which does not 

swell the plastics material with simultaneous 
input of mechanical energy, such as by stirring, 

ultrasound or megasound. 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised by 


treatment of the metallic microstructure element 
with a high-boiling fluid which does not swell 

the plastics material, preferably ethylene glycol 
or an oligomer, polymer or derivative thereof, 

propanediol, butanediol, an ester of a 
dicarboxylic acid, polyvinyl alcohol or silicone 

oil. 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised by 


treatment of the metallic microstructure element 
with a fluid which does not swell the plastics 

material, with addition of 

metal salt, such as zinc bromide, cobalt 
bromide or silver acetate, or 
free - radical former, such as 
chloronitrosobenzene, benzoyl peroxide or 

bisazoisobutyronitrile. 
A process according to any of claims 1 and 3 to 7 for 
removing crosslinked polymethyl methacrylate from a 

metallic microstructure element, characterised by 

treatment of the metallic microstructure element 
with polyethylene glycol at above 160°C, 

preferably at from 210°C to 240°C. 
A process according to any claims 1, 2 and 4 to 7, for 
removing polyoxymethylene from a metallic  

 
microstructure element, characterised by 


treatment of the metallic microstructure element 
with diethylene glycol monobutyl ether at 190°C.
