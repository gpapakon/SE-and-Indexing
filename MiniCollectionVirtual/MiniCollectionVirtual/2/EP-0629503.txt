<ABSTRACT>
An inkjet recording apparatus is provided with an inkjet head 
having a nozzle (4) , an ink passage (6, 7, 8) that is 

connected to the nozzle, and an electrostatic actuator composed 
of a diaphragm (5
) that is provided in a part of the ink 
passage and an electrode (21) placed outside of the ink passage 

opposite to the diaphragm. Recording is performed by 
moving the diaphragm by means of an electrostatic force generated 

by applying a voltage to the actuator thereby ejecting 
ink droplets from the nozzle. A drive circuit for the actuator 

comprises a timing pulse generator, a charge circuit and 
a discharge circuit. The drive circuit controls an amount of 

charge to be supplied to the actuator as well as the charge 
rate, preferably corresponding to environmental operating 

conditions of the recording apparatus. Thus a durably stable 
and precise ink ejection can be realized.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns an inkjet recording apparatus, e.g. a
printer, having electrostatic actuating means, and to a
method of controlling it. In particular, the invention concerns
a charge control means for the electrostatic actuator.Inkjet printers using an electrostatic principle for pressure
generation in an inkjet head are known in the prior art. JP-A-289351/1990
discloses an inkjet head comprising a silicon
substrate having formed therein ink passages each connected
to a respective inkjet nozzle at one end and to a common ink
reservoir at the other end. A side wall portion of the ink
passage is formed by a diaphragm as a vibration plate. A
respective individual or nozzle electrode is provided on the
outside surface of each diaphragm. Disposed opposite the
nozzle electrodes, via a gap, is a common electrode. Each
diaphragm with its nozzle electrode and the opposing common
electrode constitute an electrostatic actuator with the
nozzle electrode and the common electrode forming a pair of
capacitor plates. A similar electrostatic actuator or fluid
jet ejector is disclosed in US-A-4,520,375. In this latter
prior art, by utilizing its semiconducting property, the thin
silicon diaphragm itself forms one of the capacitor plates.
Applying a time varying voltage to the capacitor causes the
diaphragm to be set into mechanical motion and the fluid to
exit responsive to the diaphragm motion. More particularly,
when the actuator is charged to create an electrostatic field
between the capacitor plates, the diaphragm will be displaced
in a direction to increase the volume of the ink passage and
correspondingly decrease the pressure, thereby taking in ink
from the ink reservoir. A following discharge of the actuator
causes the diaphragm to return to its initial position 
thereby decreasing the volume of the ink passage resulting in
a corresponding increase of pressure in the ink passage. In
response to the pressure increase ink is ejected through the
nozzle.The following is a more detailed description of the operation
principle of such an electrostatic actuator comprising a pair
of capacitor plates of which one is attached to or formed by
a diaphragm and the other by a counter electrode (hereinafter
referred to as a nozzle electrode or simply electrode) which
is disposed opposite to the diaphragm. When a voltage is
applied to the actuator, i.e. across the diaphragm and the
nozzle electrode, the resulting electrostatic attraction
force between the nozzle electrode and the diaphragm causes
the diaphragm to bend
