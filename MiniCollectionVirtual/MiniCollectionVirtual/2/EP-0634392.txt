unsaturated, straight or branched alkanoyl having 2-26 carbon atoms, 

optionally ω-substituted with trialkylammonium, dialkylsulfonium, hydroxyl,

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of esters of alkanoyl L-carnitines 
for producing pharmaceutical compositions suitable for treating 
endotoxic shock. Since, as it will be described in detail hereinbelow, some of these 
esters are novel compounds, the present invention also relates to these 
novel esters. The esters suitable for the use according to the invention have the 
formula (I) 
 
wherein: 
Ris a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched alkanoyl, having 2-26 
carbon atoms, optionally ω-substituted with a R2 group selected from 
trialkylammonium or dialkylsulfonium wherein the alkyl group has 1-3 
carbon atoms; hydroxyl; carboxyl; halogen; methanesulfonyl and 
hydroxysulfonyl; R1is a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched alkyl having 2-26 
carbon atoms, optionally ω-substituted with R2, wherein R2 has the 
previously defined meaning, and  
 X-is the anion of a pharmacologically acceptable acid. Esters of alkanoyl L-carnitines are already known. 
US-A-4 439 438 discloses compounds having the foregoing formula (I) wherein R 
is a straight or branched alkanoyl having 2-4 carbon atoms optionally 
substituted with halogen atoms or hydroxyl, or pantothenyl or linoleyl; R1 is 
an optionally substituted straight or branched alkyl having 1-5 carbon atoms. These compounds are used for the therapeutical treatment of 
myocardial hypocontractility and as antidepressants. EP-A-0514357 A1 discloses esters of C2-C5 alkanoyl L-carnitine with 
gamma-hydroxybutyric acid useful for the treatment of hepatopathies. Esters of alkanoyl L-carnitines having the formula (I) wherein R is a 
straight or branched alkanoyl having 2-16 carbon atoms, R1 is a straight 
alkyl having 8-16 carbon atoms and X- is the anion of a pharmacologically 
acceptable acid [typically, isovaleryl L-carnitine undecyl ester chloride (ST 
722)] were disclosed in EP-A-0552137 A2 and EP-A-0552138 A2 both published 
after the priority date of the present application. The pharmacological activities reported for these esters comprise 
the antibacterial activity (particularly against bacteria belonging to the 
genera Campylobacter and Helicobacter) and the antimycotic activity, 
particularly against yeast-like fungi (Candida albicans) and filamentous fungi 
(Aspergillus fumigatus), respectively. Also EP-A-0559625, published after the priority date of the present  
 
application, discloses esters having the formula (I) wherein R is hydrogen or 
a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched alkanoyl having 2-26 carbon 
atoms and R1
