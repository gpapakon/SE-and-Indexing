The subject of the invention is an assembly for a mechanical joint, particularly by means of catching in a substantially vertical plane, of a plate, particularly of a window panel (pane) (4) on a carrying structure. The said joint permits a flexing movement of controlled amplitude for the said plate, with the aid of an articulated fastening system (10) permitting the rocking of the plate about its supporting point (P) on the said system.
