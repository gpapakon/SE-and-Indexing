<ABSTRACT>
This is a device (9) for pumping a fluid, comprising a piston (206) which can move in a metering chamber (208), this piston being driven by a motor, via coupling means which include a rotary head (236) provided with a guide path (238) at least locally oblique with respect to the axis of the device, as well as a driving component (240) which is connected to the piston and which moves along the guide path, causing the reciprocating movement of the piston. The invention also relates to an apparatus for spraying a liquid, comprising the said gas-distributing device. Application to the spraying of an air-freshening fragrance.

Apparatus (9) for the intake or delivery of a
fluid, having an axis (200) and comprising:


an outer body (202) which is at least partly
hollow,
a piston (206) which is movable within this body in
a reciprocating axial movement and secured to prevent it

rotating relative to the body (202),
a deformable leaktight membrane (252) which is
centrally fixed to the piston so as to define, with a

cap (228) located at one end of the body, a pumping
chamber (208) of variable volume for the intake or

delivery of the fluid,
a fluid inlet (212) and outlet (21) comprising
valves (220, 222), and
means for coupling the piston to a motor (204),
these coupling means comprising:


a head (236) having, on its peripheral outer
surface, at least one continuous guide path (238) closed

on itself and at least locally angularly inclined
relative to a plane which is perpendicular to the said

axis of the apparatus, this head being associated with
the motor in order to be enabled to rotate about this

axis, and
at least one drive member (240) connected to
the piston and adapted to move along the guide path of

the head, thereby causing the reciprocating axial
movement of the piston,

characterised in that:
the cap (228) comprises a flange (227) which
extends substantially parallel to the axis (200) of the

apparatus and locally surrounds the outer body (202),
and
the periphery of the membrane (252) is located
substantially parallel to the axis (200) of the

apparatus and is clamped between the flange (227) and
the body (202) which fit one into the other.
Apparatus for dispersing a liquid, comprising:

a support body (7, 17),
a refill cartridge (5) defining a reservoir for the
liquid (3) which is to be dispersed, said cartridge

being adapted to be removably attached to the support
body,
means (15, 23, 37) for diffusing said liquid, which
are carried by the cartridge and comprise a gas blowing

pipe (39) which communicates at one end with an outlet
passage (13, 15) from the cartridge into the open air

and intake means (41) for taking small amounts of liquid
into the path of the blown gas, and
the apparatus (9) according to claim 1, for the
intake or delivery of gas, this apparatus being arranged

in said support body and communicating with the gas
blowing pipe.
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterised in
that the outlet passage (13, 15) for the cartridge (5),

which extends the reservoir (33) on one side, merges
into a convergent/divergent channel (15
1
, 15
2
, 15
3
)
provided in the support body of the apparatus, the gas

blowing pipe (39) and the liquid intake means (41) being
interrupted, in the reservoir (33), at a point where

said outlet passage (13) is convergent.
Apparatus according to claim 2 or 3, characterised
in that it has a pipe for blown secondary air which

communicates at one end with said pump (9) and passes
through the support body (17) of the apparatus, to come

out around the outlet passage (15) of the exit to the
open air of the cartridge (5).
Apparatus according to any one of claims 2 to 4,
characterised in that it further comprises a

programmable electronic card (45) for controlling the
operation of said pump (9), by activating and 

sequentially measuring the distribution of gas to said
diffusion means (37) over a predetermined period of

time.
