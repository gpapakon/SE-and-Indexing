<ABSTRACT>
A disk recording and reproducing apparatus which 
realizes a simultaneous recording function with a simple 

pickup system is disclosed. The apparatus comprises a 
recording and reproducing head, a first memory for 

receiving and storing input signals at a first rate and 
supplying the stored signals at a second rate higher than 

the first rate so as to be recorded onto a disk medium at 
the second rate by the head, a second memory for receiving 

and storing signals reproduced at the second rate by the 
head and outputting the stored signals at a rate lower than 

the second rate, and control means for controlling the head 
to reproduce the Nth block (N is a natural number) and then 

repeat, while N is repetitively incremented, a sequence of 
operations of reproducing the N+1th block, moving to a 

position of the disk medium at which the Nth block is 
recorded, recording the input signals supplied thereto from 

the first memory means at the position of the disk medium 
at which the Nth block is recorded, and moving to another 

position of the disk medium at which the N+2th block is 
recorded.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a disk recording and
reproducing apparatus which adopts a synchronous recording
function involving synchronous reproduction and synchronous
recording, and more particularly to a disk recording and
reproducing apparatus suitably applied to a master disk
apparatus for producing a master disk which is an
original disk to be used to manufacture a large number of
compact disks (CDs) or mini disks (MDs) in a musical disk
manufacturing factory.When trying to manufacture a large number of compact
disks or mini disks in a musical disk manufacturing
factory, a recording medium for a cutting master which is
an original for such compact disks or mini disks must be
prepared. Normally, a magnetic tape is used as the
recording medium. FIG. 36 shows an 
outline of a conventional master recording apparatus which
is used to produce an original.Referring to FIG. 36, the master recording
apparatus 10 includes a multi-channel tape recorder 11 by
which original musical signals are recorded. Normally, a
digital video tape recorder (U-matic video tape recorder)
is used as the multi-channel tape recorder 11, and an
original sound tape on which musical signals are recorded
is produced. Musical signals are recorded in a plurality
of channels, for example, 24, on the original sound tape,
and the musical signals from the original sound tape are
converted into 2-channel signals and recorded onto a master
tape by means of a master recorder 12.The master tape is supplied to an editing apparatus
13, on which editing processing, which is necessary for
conversion of data into data of a format conforming to a
type of a disk to be cut or some other factor, is performed
to produce a master tape for final cutting. Using the
master tape for cutting, corresponding disks such as
compact disks or cassette tapes are manufactured in a disk
manufacturing factory.As musical disks have become more popular in recent
years, the demand for an original for 
disks as a recording medium is increasing. When a disk
is used as an original, there is a remarkable advantage
in that original signals can be recorded linearly
without compressing the same and can be edited with a
single original without destroying the same.Also when a disk is used as an original in place
of a tape, it is sometimes desired to replace part of a
musical signal recorded already on the disk with another
audio signal. Such replacement is desirable, for
example, when noise is included in part of a musical
signal recorded already on the disk and may possibly
obstruc

An apparatus (200) for recording and reproducing
data in blocks onto and from disk medium (300), wherein

the apparatus comprises:

a recording and reproducing head (230,310);
first memory means (202) arranged to receive and
store input data supplied at a first rate and to supply

the stored data at a second rate, higher than the first
rate, so as to be recorded onto the disk medium at the

second rate by means of said recording and reproducing
head;
second memory means (213) arranged to receive and
store data reproduced from the disk medium at the second

rate by means of said recording and reproducing head and
to output the stored data at a rate lower than the second

rate; and
control means for controlling the recording and
reproducing head,

   characterised in that the control means (500) is
arranged to control recordal of input data supplied to

said first memory means (202) at said first rate, by
controlling said recording and reproducing head to

reproduce the Nth block of data, N being an integer, and
then to perform for repeatedly incremented values of N

the sequence of operations of:

reproducing the (N+1)th block of data second rate
for supply to said second memory means (213);
moving to the position of the disk medium at which
said Nth block is recorded;
