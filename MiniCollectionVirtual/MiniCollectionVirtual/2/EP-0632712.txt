<ABSTRACT>
A heat dressing for treatment of skin areas and comprising a heat generating unit and a liquid-absorbing adhesive layer which prior to use is coated with a strippable release layer. The adhesive layer is preferably of a hydrocolloidal material and may optionally contain one or more medicaments or be coated with alginate fibre mats. The heat generating unit generates heat preferably by means of galvanic or chemical energy, and the heat dressing may further comprise elements for controlling the heat development and/or the surface temperature

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a self-adhesive heat
dressing for use in local treatment of skin and body
areas such as known from EP-A-0 376 490.Heat is widely used for treatment of minor nuisances, such
as infiltrations and muscular tensions.In most cases the heat treatment is capable of removing or
minimizing these nuisances by a relatively short treatment.
Heat is also used as an analgesic e.g. for menstrual
pain. Heat treatment is particularly important for treatment
of rheumatism. Rheumatism cannot be cured, but the
heat treatment can ease the worst pain.Heat treatment has also been found to have significant
effect for reducing skin lesions, such as e.g. psoriasis
plaques. An article by Harukuni Urabe, MD, Keiko
Mishitani, MD, Hiromu Konda, MD: Hyperthermia in the
Treatment of Psoriasis. Arch. Dermatol.- Vol. 117,
December 1981, pp. 770-774, mentions an experiment in
which psoriasis has successfully been treated with heat.
The treatment lasted for 13-53 days. Heat dressing was
changed 2-3 times a day, and in each period the skin
temperature was raised to between 42 and 43 Â°C, which
temperature was maintained for more than 2 hours.For many years it has been known that the temperature is
of great importance for regeneration of tissue, and thus
also for the healing process in a wound area. In
particular, attention has been given to the fact that a
lowered temperature in a wounded area causes reduced
metabolism and consequently reduced wound-healing. This is
in complete agreement with the knowledge that when transplanting
tissue the greatest success is achieved when the 
tissue graft has been cooled during the process. By cooling
and consequently reduced metabolism the life time of
the tissue is thus increased.Over the last few decades occlusive treatment of wounds
has been increasingly used, and everything indicates
that within long occlusive treatment of various kinds of
wounds, such as burns, operative wounds, bed sores, leg
sores, and diabetic wounds, will be the most commonly used
method of treatment.The great success of the occlusive method of treatment is
largely due to the moist wound environment, which a number
of examinations have shown i.a. causes an increased
migration of epithelial cells. More recent experiments
have, however, shown that the isolating effect of the
occlusive method of treatment also plays an important
part for the wound-healing. By occlusive treatment the
treated skin and wound areas are isolated, which may
result in a slight increase in the surface temperature of
the
