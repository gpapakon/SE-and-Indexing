<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns the fabrication of oxide-filled 
isolation trenches in integrated circuits. A network of trenches 

is etched in the surface of a uniformly doped wafer which has 
experienced no substantial processing steps. Such a wafer will 

have little, if any, surface damage. Such a wafer will etch to 
the same depth everywhere, because two major factors which affect 

etching rate are (a) surface damage and (b) doping non-uniformity, 
and these factors are absent. The trenches are then 

filled with oxide. They define islands upon which devices (such 
as transistors) may now be fabricated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of forming isolation
trenches in a semiconductor substrate.Figure 1 is highly simplified, and illustrates nine CELLs
contained in an integrated circuit (IC). (Interconnections
between the CELLs are not shown.) Each CELL contains a completed
device, such as a transistor (not shpwn), which must be
electrically insulated from neighbouring CELLS. The insulation
is indicated by the empty SPACES, positioned between the devices,
and which make up the gridwork 3, indicated in phantom. Points
A, B, C, and D indicate corresponding locations.Gridwork 3 indicates that empty spaces, located in the
substrate, are used as insulation. However, in fact, the spaces
are not actually empty, but contain structures which facilitate
insulation. (One reason for using these structures, rather than
merely the silicon which forms the substrate, is that, for a
given consumption of area, higher insulation values can be
obtained from the structures than from silicon itself.) Several
different types of structure are used.One approach is the use of junction isolation, as shown in
Figure 2. A PN junction, formed between a P+ and N region, is
held in a reverse-biased condition, and acts as an extremely high
resistance, or insulator.Another approach, shown in Figure 3, is to use TRENCHes
filled with specific dielectrics, which act as insulators. The
TRENCHes can be configured into the pattern of the gridwork 3 in
Figure 1. The structure labeled 6 in Figure 3 undergoes further
processing, as indicated, in order to form a completed device.Yet another approach is shown in Figure 4, wherein V-GROOVEs
are used. A specific type of V-groove approach is shown in the 
sequence of Figure 5. In Figure 5A, deep V-GROOVEs are etched
into the surface of <100> silicon. An N+ diffusion is
undertaken, followed by growth of a silicon dioxide layer on the
surface, producing the N+ region and the silicon dioxide layer
shown in Figure 5B.In Figure 5B, a thick layer of polysilicon is deposited upon
the silicon dioxide. Then, the back (ie, the bottom part of the
wafer shown in Figure 5B) is abraded away in a lapping process.
The wafer is then flipped over, and transistors are fabricated
on the new surface S which was created by the lappping operation,
resulting in the structure shown in Figure 5C.The prior art approaches of Figures 3, 4, and 5, produce
deep trenches (ie, deeper than 1.0 µm). In some fabrication
processes, very shallow isolation trenches are required (eg, in
the range of 0.1 - 0.3 µm in depth). Further, these
