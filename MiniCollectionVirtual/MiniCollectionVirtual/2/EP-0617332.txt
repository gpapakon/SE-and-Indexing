<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a manufacturing process for
a lead-frame forming material, more specifically to a
manufacturing process for a lead-frame forming material,
whereby the lead-frame having a uniform quality can be produced
in large volume.A lead-frame is a metal frame forming an extension line
lead terminal with a die pad which is used for fixing a
semiconductor pellet used in a plastic mold IC and a ceramics
package IC. There is used for the metal frame, a lead-frame
forming metal plate made of alloy mainly containing copper or
copper-nickel as a material. In recent years, an element of an
active metal series such as titanium and chromium has been
added to the material as well. In any event, it is desired that
the material used have good mechanical strength, high electric
conductivity, high softening temperature, a coefficient of
thermal expansion matching the coefficient of thermal expansion
of a semiconductor pellet and a package material, secured
flatness of a- lead, small bending anisotropy, good heat
releasing performance, and a low cost. A pattern is formed on
the lead-frame forming metal plate by a punching out or by
etching with an etchant. Punching can be carried out at a low
cost and a precise pattern can be formed by the etching method. In recent years, development in semiconductor and
integrated circuit manufacturing accompanied with an increased
demand for electronic parts using lead-frames has resulted in
an increased requirement for producing lead-frame having
uniform quality in large volume.In manufacturing lead-frame, there has been used in the
past, an alloy plate mainly containing, for example, copper or
an alloy plate mainly containing copper-nickel, and in order to
remove rust preventives applied on the alloy plate, the alloy
plate was subjected in regular succession to a degrease
treatment and an acid cleaning treatment. Then, a liquid
resist was coated on the plate surface by a wheeler coating
method. For example, a light-sensitive layer of a dry type,
such as a negative type was deposited and dried to provide a
light-sensitive material layer. After the light-sensitive
layer was exposed through a prescribed etching pattern, it was
then subjected to a developing treatment and any exposed parts
of the light-sensitive layer were removed. Then, the alloy
plate was dipped in an etchant to form a prescribed etching
pattern on the alloy plate surface.In order to produce a conventional lead-frame having
such a pattern formed thereon while having uniform quality in
large volume,
