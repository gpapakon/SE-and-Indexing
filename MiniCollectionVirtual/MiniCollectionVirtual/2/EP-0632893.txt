U.S. application Serial No. 07/856,176, filed March 23, 1992, is also a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Serial No. 701,465, filed May 15, 1991, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Serial 10 No. 524,212, filed May 15, 1990.Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to methods for deter¬ mining the presence or amount of antigenic substances in samples. The invention is directed to fluorescence 15 immunoassays using particular fluorescence dyes which are essentially free of aggregation and serum binding and, thus, are particularly suited for the measurement of antigenic substances in biological materials such as serum, plasma and whole blood.20 Background of the InventionPublications and other reference materials referred to herein are incorporated herein by this reference.The determination of the presence or amount of anti¬ genic substances is commonly performed by immunoassay.25 Immunoassay techniques are based on the binding of the antigenic substance being assayed (the "target analyte") and a receptor for the target analyte. Either the target analyte or the receptor may be labeled to permit detec¬ tion. Various labels have been employed for use in30 immunoassays, including radioisotopes, enzymes and 

fluorescent compounds. Many different types of immuno¬ assays are known in the art, including competitive inhibition assays, sequential addition assays, direct "sandwich" assays, radioallergosorbent assays, radio- immunosorbent assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.The basic reaction underlying most immunoassays is the binding of certain substance, termed the "ligand" or "analyte", by a characteristic protein (receptor) to form a macromolecular complex. These binding processes are reversible reactions, and the extent of complex formation for particular analyte and receptor concentrations is regulated by an equilibrium constant according to the law of mass action. Thus, at equilibrium, some of the analyte always exists unbound (free) .In a competitive inhibition immunoassay, the unknown quantity of target analyte in the sample competes with a known amount of labeled target
