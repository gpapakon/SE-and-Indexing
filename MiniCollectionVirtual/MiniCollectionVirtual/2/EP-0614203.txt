<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an articulation for the reed of a microswitch, providing an electrical contact between the reed (10) and a terminal of the microswitch, including two opposed vees (12-1, 12-2) at the bottom of which tabs (10-2, 10-3) bear, integral with the reed. According to the invention, the articulation and the terminal are formed from a single flat piece (12') bent at one end in such a way as to at least partially form the two vees. According to one embodiment of the invention, the extremity of the single part (12') is bent into an "S" so as to form the two vees in the hollows of the "S".

<CLAIMS>
A blade articulation for a microswitch ensuring 
electrical contact between the blade (10) and a microswitch 

terminal, including two opposite vees (12-1, 12-2) at the 
bottom of which tongues (10-2, 10-3) integral with the blade 

abut, characterized in that the articulation and the terminal 
are formed by a single flat part (12') folded at one end so as 

to form the two vees. 
The articulation of claim 1, wherein the two 
opposite vees (12-1, 12-2) are offset one with respect to the 

other perpendicularly to the plane of the blade (10) and 
wherein the end of the single part (12') is folded as an "S" in 

order to form the two offset vees in the curves of the "S". 
The articulation of claim 2, wherein the central 
portion of the "S" is extended by a stud (12-3) cut out from a 

portion adjacent the central portion. 
The articulation of claim 2, wherein the bottom of 
at least one of the vees (12-2) includes a coating of a noble 

metal deposited before folding.
