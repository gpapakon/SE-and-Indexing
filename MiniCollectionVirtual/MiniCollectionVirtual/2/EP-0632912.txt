<ABSTRACT>
A real time data processing system consisting of a plurality of processing nodes (NODE1, NODE2, NODE3) and a write only reflective data link (46) for transferring information containing writes only between the plurality of processing nodes (NODE1, NODE2, NODE3). All the nodes (NODE1, NODE2, NODE3) include a bus (22), a processor (20) coupled to the bus (22), a memory (40) having at least two ports with one port (42) connected to the bus (22) and the other port (48) connected to the data link (46) and a sensor (60) for sensing a write to the memory (40). At least one node has a VME bus (22) as the bus (22) and serves as an I/O connected to one port (42) of the memory (40). Further a local bus (24) is included for inputting and outputting from the memory (40). The local bus (24) is connected to a third port (44) of the memory (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel real time data
processing system including two or more data processing nodes or
units wherein as data is written to a memory in one mode, it is
sensed and reflected to memories in the associated nodes.Such systems are known from the European Patent Application published under No. EP-A-0 251 686.
Such systems use two ported
memories and although successful in reflecting data among a
plurality of nodes, these systems have limitations which will
become more readily apparent from the following description.The present invention as defined in independent claim 1 is concerned with
a data processing system
characterized by an architecture that provides efficient coupling
of multiple processor nodes for real-time applications. This
architecture allows data to be shared among different processing
nodes in a distributed computing system via a parallel, high speed
real-time linkage between the physical memories of the nodes. It
also provides the full advantages of the common memory, but without 
the non-deterministic access latencies that are found in most
traditional multiprocessor system with shared memory.Further embodiments of the invention are specified in the appended dependent claims.Other and further advantages of the present invention
will become readily evident from the following description of a
preferred embodiment when taken in conjunction with the appended
drawings.Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating a system
according to the present invention;Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram illustrating bus
interconnection;Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram showing details of
interfaces and controllers used in the present invention;Fig. 4 is a schematic diagram showing details of the high
speed data interface;Fig. 5 is a detail block diagram of the HSDI;Fig. 6 is a diagram of global memory organization;Fig. 7 is a time chart of memory coupling bus grants, all
nodes requesting;Fig. 8 is a time chart of MC bus grants, random requests;Fig. 9 is a time chart of MC bus continuous node request
sequencing;Figs. 10 and 11 shown the MC system control/status
register map and ID registers; and Fig. 12 is a schematic diagram showing details of
interfaces and controllers used in a modification of the invention.Referring to Fig. 1, a processing system is shown that
comprises a plurality of nodes, only three of which are shown.
Node 1 comprises a main processor 20 interconnected by conventional
interfaces with a VME bus 22 serving as an I/O bus and a local bus
24 which could be a SEL bus. Expansion
