<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a liquid coating composition for 
forming a liquid crystal display element insulating film, 

which comprises a solution to be obtained by hydrolysis of 
Si(OR)₄ in the presence of an alkaline catalyst, a 

hydrolyzed product of R1
n
Si(OR²)

 and/or Ti(OR³)₄, an 
aluminium salt and a deposition inhibitor, all having been 

uniformly mixed in an organic solvent. R, R² and R³ each 
are a C₁ to C₅ alkyl group, R¹ is an alkyl, alkenyl or 

aryl group, and n is 0 to 2. Though containing a 
trialkoxysilane having a high repelling property, the 

liquid coating composition may form an insulating film 
having high mechanical strength on a substrate and the 

coatability of a polyimide solution over the film is good. 
The adhesiveness of the oriented polyimide film to the 

insulating film is good. The insulating film has a high 
insulation property and has no bad influence on the 

display performance of liquid crystal display elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a protective 
insulating film for a transparent conductive film of a 
liquid crystal display element. More particularly, it 
relates to a liquid coating composition which is applied 
to a transparent conductive film of a liquid crystal 
display element and hardened by heat to form a coating 
with excellent insulation property and surface hardness, 
for a more reliable liquid crystal display element and an 
improvement in the production yield thereof. The increasing size of liquid crystal display 
elements has been accompanied by the formation of oxide 
films for the purpose of insulation and protection of 
transparent electrodes. Known methods for the formation 
of these oxide films are gas-phase methods such as the 
vaporization method, the sputtering method, etc. and 
coating methods which employ liquid coating compositions 
for the formation of oxide films, the latter being most 
widely used in the light of productivity and ease of 
formation of films on large-sized substrates. The liquid  
 
coating compositions used are hydrolyzed products of 
tetraalkoxysilanes, and their complexes with other metal 
alkoxides or metal chelates. The formation of insulating films by coating 
methods is preferably done through thermal hardening at 
temperatures of 300°C or lower, to avoid such problems as 
variations in resistance of transparent conductive films, 
energy loss, glass deformation, etc. Where a hydrolyzed product of a tetraalkoxysilane 
is used as the liquid coating composition, needed is 
heating at temperatures of 450°C or higher so as to form a 
coating having a sufficient hardness. For the purpose of 
evading the disadvantage, use of acetylacetonato compounds 
has been proposed (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2-48403). 
However, acetylacetonato compounds releas their ligand 
of acetylacetone which frequently remained in the coating 
formed to worsen the insulating property of the coating. 
When the coating was used as the insulating film for 
liquid crystal display elements, there occurred another 
problem to worsen the coatability of a polyimide or 
polyamic acid solution (hereinafter referred to as a 
"polyimide solution") to be coated over the coating to 
form a film to be oriented. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 
2-258646 has proposed a coating composition containing an 
aluminium salt, and they say that, when baked at low  
 
temperatures, the composition yields a hardened coating 
having a high hardness and a good insulation property and 
that the coatability of
