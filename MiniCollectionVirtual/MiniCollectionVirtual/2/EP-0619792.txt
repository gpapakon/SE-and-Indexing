<ABSTRACT>
A hybrid aircraft with a large non-rotating balloon chamber (1) containing a lighter-than-air gas which provides a large static lifting force having a magnitude substantially greater than the weight of the aircraft. It comprises a support structure (20) which is substantially longer in length than in width and is encased within the balloon chamber (1). The support structure system has two ends (22) which protrude from the balloon chamber at opposite sides along the center line of the balloon chamber. A rotatable rotor frame (15) is suspended to the ends of the support structure about the non-rotating balloon chamber. The aircraft has a plurality of blade airfoils (4) connected to the rotor frame and oriented radially relative to the balloon chamber. The angle of attack of each blade can be varied. A thrust means is mounted at or near the outboard end of the blade airfoils. A wing airfoil perpendicularly connected to the end of each blade airfoil at the same end as the thrust means. The angle of attack of each wing airfoil can be varied. The aircraft also has a cab, a load line, and an anti-torque device as required.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aircraft that is 
capable of ultra-heavy lifting at a slow speed for 
extended periods of time without refueling. More particularly, the invention relates to a hybrid 
aircraft that provides both aerostatic and aerodynamic 
lift. The hybrid aircraft according to the invention, which 
is particularly useful in both the logging and 
construction industries, can be briefly disclosed as a 
semibuoyant composite aircraft comprising a non-rotating 
aerostat. Semi-buoyant composite aircrafts have already been 
devised, with a balloon rotating about vertical and horizontal axes respectively, 
see GB-A-1,460,822 and CA-A-1,171,835. These known 
aircrafts are efficient but the vertical axis vehicles suffer from a substantial 
increase of drag (3 fold) and side force resulting from 
the Magnus effect due to the rotation of their balloon. 
Likewise, the horizontal axis vehicles are more complex 
and much heavier. The object of the present invention is to provide 
a semi-buoyant composite aircraft comprising a balloon 
that is non-rotating, thereby eliminating the Magnus 
effect for vertical rotation axis vehicles and the difficult 
problems associated with the existence of a rotating 
balloon having a horizontal axis. The invention can be broadly disclosed as a hybrid 
aircraft with a large non-rotating balloon chamber 
containing a lighter-than-air gas which provides a large 
static lifting force having a magnitude greater than the 
empty weight of the aircraft. A support structure system  
 
which is substantially longer in length than in width is 
encased within the balloon chamber. The support structure 
system has two ends which protrude from the balloon 
chamber at opposite sides thereof, along the center line 
of the balloon chamber. A rotatable rotor frame is 
suspended from the ends of the support structure system 
about the nonrotating balloon chamber. Blade airfoils are connected to the rotor frame and 
are oriented radially relative to the axis. The angle of 
attack of these blade airfoils can be varied. A thrust 
means is mounted at or near the outboard end of the blade 
airfoils. Wing airfoils are perpendicularly connected to 
the end of the blade airfoil at the same end as the 
thrust means. The angle of attack of these wing airfoils 
can also be varied. The aircraft further comprises a cab, a load line and 
two anti-torque devices when the aircraft has a vertical 
axis, one to keep the balloon chamber from rotating and 
the other to maintain and/or adjust the

<CLAIMS>
A hybrid aircraft comprising: 

a large non-rotatable balloon chamber (1) 
containing a lighter-than-air gas which provides a large 

static lifting force having a magnitude greater than the 
empty weight of said aircraft; 
a support structure (20) which is substantially 
longer in length than in width and is encased within the 

balloon chamber, said support structure having two ends (22,28) 
which protrude from the balloon chamber at opposite sides 

along the center line of the balloon chamber;
