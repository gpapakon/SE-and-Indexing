<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for controlling a heating element in an automotive vehicle with a control device which enables current to flow through the heating element as a function of the occurrence of a specific prescribed state. The intention of the device is to ensure the heating element is only activated when the driver of the motor vehicle actually wishes to drive away. For this purpose, there is provision for a first switching means (12) to be provided which switches off an immobiliser device (20) and simultaneously enables the current to flow.

<CLAIMS>
Device for controlling a heating element in an 
automotive vehicle, having a control device which enables 

a flow of current through the heating element as a 
function of the onset of a specific prescribable state, 

characterized in that a first switching means (12) is 
provided which switches off an immobilizer (20) and 

simultaneously enables the flow of current. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a second switching means (22) is provided which, 

when activated, likewise enables a flow of current 
through the heating element and simultaneously activates 

the immobilizer (20). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the second switching means (22) is a preheating 

switch which is coupled to an ignition lock. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the immobilizer (20) can be 

switched off by means of a mechanical switch (24). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the immobilizer (20) can be 

switched off by means of a sensor (26) which can preferably 
receive coded infrared signals or ultrasonic signals. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the heating element is sheathed-element 

heater plugs (18) of an internal combustion 
engine with compression ignition. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the heating element is used for 

heating a sensor for detecting the composition of the  
 

exhaust gases of the internal combustion engine.
