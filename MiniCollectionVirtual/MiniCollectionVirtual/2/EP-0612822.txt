<ABSTRACT>
A hot melt stick that includes a core of a 
moisture-curable hot melt composition and a moisture-resistant 

shell coaxial with the core. The shell 
includes one or more ethylene-containing copolymers 

that are compatible with the core upon melting. The 
hot melt stick is adapted for delivery to the melting 

chamber of a hot melt applicator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hot melt sticks
based upon moisture-curable hot melt compositions.Moisture-curable hot melt compositions are
adhesive, coating, or sealant compositions that are
solid at room temperature, but melt at elevated
temperatures and then cure in the presence of
moisture to produce a crosslinked thermoset resin.
Examples of such compositions include isocyanate-terminated
polyurethane prepolymers and silyl-terminated
prepolymers. The isocyanate or silyl
terminal groups react with moisture to produce a
cured, thermoset resin. Moisture-curable hot melt
compositions are desirable because although they are
applied like conventional thermoplastic hot melt
compositions, the final cured product exhibits
superior properties (e.g., tensile, shear, and peel
strength), especially at elevated temperatures.Due to their moisture sensitivity, it is
customary to use complex storage and handling
procedures with moisture-curable hot melt
compositions. Typically, the composition is stored
prior to use in a sealed metal canister under an
inert atmosphere. Applicators have been developed
which utilize heated platens that are placed into the 
top opening of the canister to melt the top layer of
the moisture-curable hot melt composition for
delivery using a pump. These applicators are
expensive and utilize a complex sealing arrangement
in order to exclude moisture during application.
Moreover, it takes time to remove the platen from the
canister when it is time to change canisters.Other applicators have been developed where
the entire contents of the canister are heated in
order to convert the composition into a suitable form
for application. This may be accomplished by
transferring the canister to a pre-heater. Following
pre-heating, the canister is transferred to the hot
melt applicator. Alternatively, the canister may be
placed directly in the hot melt applicator and heated
there; this process, however, is time-consuming. In
contrast, non-moisture sensitive thermoplastic hot
melt compositions can be used in "melt on demand"
applicators; that is, they are prepared in the form
of a stick which is simply supplied to the melting
chamber of the applicator without pre-heating or
moisture-exclusion for direct application.Attempts have been made to improve the
storage and handling of moisture-curable hot melt
compositions. For example, Japanese Patent
Application No. 3-36015 describes providing a
moisture-curable hot melt composition with a 5-200 µm (5-200
micron) thick moisture-resistant outer coating to
improve
