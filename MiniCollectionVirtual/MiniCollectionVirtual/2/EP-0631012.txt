<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a process for adjusting the thickness and gloss and/or smoothness in the treatment of fibrous webs in at least one press nip formed by rolls, at least one adjustable bending roll being used and a multiplicity of correction sections being produced over the length of the press nip, which can be adjusted in a different way with respect to temperature and/or pressure, the impending pressing force changes in the correction sections of the relevant press nip, caused by changes of the local diameter resulting from surface temperature changes of the relevant roll, being at least considerably prevented by means of sufficient supporting element and cover flexibility, for decoupling both correction processes.

Method of influencing the thickness and gloss and/or smoothness
during the treatment of a fibre material web in at least one press

gap (8) formed by rolls (1, 5), wherein at least one of the rolls (1, 5)
comprises a deflection controlled roll (1) with a flexible roll jacket (2)

supported in the plane of the pressing force on a plurality of support
elements (4), and wherein the web thickness present over the width

of the fibre material web can be corrected by corresponding pressure
loading of the support elements (4), 
characterised in that
 the roll
jacket (2) of the deflection controlled roll (1) has a flexibility which is

so high that, through the co-operation of the support elements (4)
and the respectively associated sections of the roll jacket (2), a plurality

of independent pressing force correction sections (6) are
formed, which at least substantially do not mutually influence each

other;
in that
 the actual values of gloss and/or smoothness present over
the width of the fibre material web can be influenced by local

changes of the surface temperature of at least one of the two rolls (1,
5);

and 
in that
, for the decoupling of the two correction processes, the
changes in the pressing force which threaten as a result of changes

of the surface temperature and the associated local changes in diameter
of the relevant roll are at least substantially prevented in the

correction sections of the relevant press gap (8) by means of adequate
support element and jacket resilience. 
Method in accordance with claim 1, 
characterised in that
 hydraulic
support elements (4) are associated with the individual pressing

force correction sections (6) and are, on the one hand, supplied with
the same pressure and, on the other hand, are individuall
y controllable
with different pressure in dependence on the actual and desired

values of the web thickness.
Method in accordance with claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that

the number of the pressing force correction sections (6) is selected to
be at least substantially the same as the number of adjacent differentially

heatable and/or coolable temperature correction sections (7)
provided on at least one of the rolls (1, 5).
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterised
in that
 the two correction processes are superimposed on one
another in dependence on the measured thickness values, on the

one hand, and the measured values of gloss and/or smoothness, on
the other hand.
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterised
in that
, on the one hand, the transverse smoothness and/or
gloss profile and, on the other hand, the transverse thickness profile

of the fibre material web are measured and are compared in each
case with predeterminable desired values; and 
in that
 the mutually
decoupled influencing from a technical control viewpoint of the respective

correction sections (6, 7) with respect to temperature and
hydraulic support element pressure takes place in dependence on

the respective difference in the desired and actual values. 
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterised
in that
 one of the rolls (1, 5) forming the press gap (8) is made
in such a way that it can be sectionally heated and/or cooled and

the pressing force correction sections (6) are provided at the other
roll.
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterised
in that
 the flexibility of the roll jacket (2) of the roll (1) having
the pressing force correction section (6) is so selected that the diameter

changes of one of the rolls (1, 5) in consequence of local
temperature changes are substantially without influence on the

pressing force in the pressing gap (8) resulting from the constant
pressure source common to all the support elements (4).
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterised
in that
 the local heating of at least one roll (5) takes place from
the inside and/or from the outside.
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterised
in that
 the detection of the actual values for gloss and smoothness
and of the thickness in the direction of movement of the web

takes place after the press gap (8).
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterised
in that
 at least the actual values corresponding to the gloss
and/or to the smoothness can be used in a predeterminable manner

for the control of a moisturising unit for the fibre material web provided
upstream of the press gap (8) in correspondence with the correction

sections. 
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterised
in that
 the separately detected actual values for gloss and
smoothness, on the one hand, and for thickness, on the other hand,

can be mutually modified via correction elements in a predeterminable
manner prior to their use as control parameters.
