<ABSTRACT>
In a method of making screws, rivets or similar objects from a metal wire (6) the wire (6) is moved through a stationary cropping bushing (14) forwardly to a movable cropping bushing (24) present in a receiving position, following which the movable cropping bushing (24) is moved away from the receiving position substantially transversely to the axial direction of the wire to release a blank from the wire (6). The movable cropping bushing (24, 25) is then moved together with the released blank (26) further on to a discharge position, in which a punch (27) is adapted to move the blank (26) partly into a die (16) and to compress the blank (26) sufficiently to pre-upset it by cold flowing in the region between the die (16) and the movable cropping bushing (25). In an apparatus of making screws, rivets or similar objects the movable cropping bushing (24, 25) is secured to a transport device (15), by means of which it can be moved from a receiving position opposite the stationary bushing (14) to a discharge position opposite a die (16) between said die and a punch (27), which is adapted to move the blank (26) partly into the die (16) and to compress the blank (26) sufficiently to pre-upset it by cold flowing in the region between the die (16) and the movable cropping bushing (25).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns an apparatus for making screws, 
rivets or similar objects, wherein a metal wire is passed 
through a stationary cropping bushing forwardly to a movable 
cropping bushing present in a receiving position, 
following which the movable cropping bushing is moved away 
from the receiving position substantially transversely to 
the axial direction of the wire to release a blank from 
the wire. In the making of e.g. screws it is known to use an upsetting 
process wherein a blank is retained in a die, one 
end of the blank being formed by a punch or a tool. Before a blank can be placed in such a die, the blank is 
provided by e.g. cutting from a wire. This typically takes 
place by a so-called cropping process wherein a wire is 
moved through a cropping bushing into a cropping tool. Release 
of a blank from the wire then takes place by briefly 
moving the cropping tool transversely to the longitudinal 
direction of the wire. This cropping tool is often open 
such that a so-called open cropping is performed. The resulting blank is then to be moved by means of some 
form of transport mechanism to a position outside the die 
where further shaping is to take place. Here, a punch can 
move the blank into the die and then perform a pre-upsetting 
operation, the die being closed at the other end by a 
bottom stop, e.g. in the form of an ejector pin. A relatively complicated transport mechanism is necessary 
for moving the released blank from the cropping position 
and forwardly for insertion into the die. The cropping  
 
tool itself may form part of the transport mechanism, but 
in that case it must be removed from the position in front 
of the die while the punch moves the blank into the die, 
which limits the production rate. In addition to the complicated transport mechanism, this 
technique has the drawback that the mentioned open cropping 
does not provide an optimum quality of the resulting 
blanks, unless a complicated holding mechanism retains the 
wire in the tool during the cropping process. The disuniform 
quality of the blanks impedes optimum control of the 
subsequent steps in the forming process. It is also known to use so-called closed cropping in other 
connections, wherein the employed cropping tool has the 
shape of a closed cropping bushing, which gives a much 
better quality of the resulting blanks. The use of this 
principle in traditional screw machines requires a complicated 
transport mechanism and also another ejector pin to 
eject the blank from the cropping bushing.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for making screws, rivets or similar 
objects, comprising a stationary cropping bushing (14) 

through which a wire (6) can be moved forwardly to a 
movable cropping bushing (24) which is adapted to release 

a wire blank in a subsequent cropping process from the 
wire (6) for further forming, and wherein the movable 

cropping bushing (24, 25) is secured to a transport device 
(15) by means of which it can be moved from a receiving 

position opposite the stationary bushing (14) to a discharge 
position opposite a die (16) between said die and a 

punch (27), which is adapted to move the blank partly into 
the die (16) and to compress the blank (26) sufficiently 

to pre-upset it by cold flowing in the region between the 
die (16) and the movable cropping bushing (25), 
characterized
 
by including at least two movable 

cropping bushings (24, 25) 
arranged in a rotatable cropping table (15) in such a 

way that when one cropping bushing is in the receiving 
position, simultaneously another cropping bushing is in 

the discharge position. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that a plurality of movable cropping bushings 

(24, 25) are arranged in said rotatable cropping table (15) which is 
capable of assuming a plurality of positions corresponding 

to the number of movable cropping bushings (24, 
25).
