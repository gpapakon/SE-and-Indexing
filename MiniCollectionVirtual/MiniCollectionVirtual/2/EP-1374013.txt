<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for controlling access to digital information utilizes a location identity attribute that defines a specific geographic location. The location identity attribute is associated with the digital information such that the digital information can be accessed only at the specific geographic location. The location identity attribute further includes a location value and a proximity value. The location value corresponds to a location of an intended recipient appliance of the digital information, and may be further defined in terms of latitude, longitude and altitude dimensions. The location identity attribute is enforced by allowing access to the digital information only at the specific geographic location. As a first part of this enforcement process, the location of an appliance through which access to the digital information is sought is identified. The appliance location is then compared to the specific geographic location defined by the location identity attribute, and access to the digital information is allowed only if the appliance location falls within the specific geographic location. There are many ways to identity the location of the appliance, including: (1) resolving the appliance location from a street address for the appliance; (2) retrieving the appliance location from a file stored within the appliance; (3) recovering the appliance location from a GPS receiver embedded in the appliance; and (4) recovering the appliance location by triangulating RF signals received by the appliance.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR USING LOCATION IDENTITY TO CONTROL ACCESS TO DIGITAL INFORMATIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to the communication of digital information, and more particularly, to methods and systems for controlling interchange of digital information using a location integrity attribute associated with the digital information.2. Description of Related Art Rapid advances in computer, telecommunications and networking technology have enabled an avalanche of new opportunities and applications that were impossible just a few years ago. These advances are exemplified by the explosive growth in popularity of the Internet. As known in the art, the Internet is an interconnection of computer networks that enables computers of all kinds to communicate with each other and share information. Companies, individuals, government agencies, charitable organizations, and academic centers, of all sizes, regularly use the Internet to share information, deliver services, and exchange a wide range of content. The Internet functions as a distributed network of systems that is neither controlled nor managed by any one entity. Physical and logical pathways that facilitate the exchange of information connect these networks to each other.In spite of the tremendous value that this information access has brought to society, there are also enormous costs associated with the uncontrolled flow of information. One of the most important considerations for a communication system is the control over information security and access. In many cases, a sender of information wants to ensure that the intended recipient can only access the information, and that any other unintended recipients of the information are denied access. This information security and access control is typically provided by an encryption system 

that converts the information into a secret code for transmission over a public network. In an encryption system, the sender converts the original data, or "plaintext," into a coded equivalent called "ciphertext" using an encryption algorithm. The ciphertext may then be decoded (or decrypted) by the receiver and thereby turned back into plaintext. The encryption algorithm uses a key, which is a binary number that is typically from 40 to 128 bits in length. The greater the number of bits in the key, the more possible key combinations and the longer it would take to break the code. The data is encrypted, or "locked," by combining the bits in the key mathematically with
