<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to soluble synthetic
polymer-bound anthracyclines, to their preparation and to
pharmaceutical compositions containing them.Doxorubicin, 4'-epidoxorubicin and 4-demethoxydaunorubicin
are examples of anthracyclines which
are known from the prior art and which are currently used
in the clinical treatment of neoplastic malignancies; see
for example, F.Arcamone: "Doxorubicin" Medicinal Chemistry
monograph, vol 17, Academic Press 1981.Many polymeric derivatives of doxorubicin, endowed
with antitumour activity, have been prepared. Amongst
these, a particularly promising candidate for clinical
development is soluble polymer-bound doxorubicin, which
consists of hydrophilic moieties and peptide chains to
which doxorubicin and 2-hydroxypropylamine are linked.
This polymer-bound-doxorubicin derivative is prepared by
condensing doxorubicin hydrochloride with a methacrylic
polymeric precursor containing peptidyl chains, activated
as the p-nitrophenyl ester, in dimethylsulfoxide in the
presence of triethylamine followed by aminolysis of the
remaining ester groups with 1-amino-2-hydroxypropane.
Incubation of this material with rat lysosomal enzymes
(tritosomes) cleaves the amidic bond between the terminal
amino acid and doxorubicin [J.Kopecek etal., Biomaterials
10, 335 (1989); R.Duncan etal., Biochem. Pharmacol., 39
1125 (1990); R.Duncan etal., J.Controlled Release 10, 51
(1989); 18 123 (1992) and 19 331 (1992)].Duncan, R. et al.: MAKROMOLECULARE CHEMIE, MACROMOLECULAR
SYMPOSIA, vol. 70/71, 1993, pages 157-162 describes the mechanism of action of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)
methacrylamide copolymer conjugates for delivery of doxorubicin.A problem with conventional processes, for example as
described above, is that it can be difficult to remove the
doxorubicin from the doxorubicin polymer conjugate. This
is due to the formation of Ï€-complexes between bound and
free doxorubicin; the material has been shown to behave as
one entity in dialysis, molecular filtration and gel
chromatography [J.Feijen etal., J.Controlled Release J,
301 (1985)]. The polymer-bound-anthracycline systems of the
present invention are based on methacrylic polymers bearing
hydrophilic moieties, peptidyl pendant chains linked only
to the amino group of anthracycline and residues of
glycine, either in the form of free acid or in the form of
amide derivative. These systems have the advantage over
the prior art that the anthracycline may be easily released
from the polymer to which it is bound. In addition, the
polymer-bound
