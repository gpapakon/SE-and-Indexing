<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to nitrogenous 
aluminum-silicon powder metallurgical alloy and 
manufacturing method thereof. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to nitrogenous aluminum-silicon 
powder metallurgical alloy and manufacturing method 
thereof used for a heat sink or the like, which is one of 
the material constituting a semiconductor device. In a material constituting a substrate for a 
semiconductor device, strain must not be generated by 
thermal stress. Therefore, the material constituting the 
substrate for a semiconductor device must have a 
coefficient of thermal expansion not much different from 
that of the semiconductor element or that of a material to 
be combined. More specifically, it is required that the 
material has coefficient of thermal expansion close to the 
coefficient of thermal expansion of the Si (silicon) or 
GaAs (gallium arsenic) semiconductor, and between the 
coefficient of thermal expansion of the semiconductor and 
that of Aℓ (aluminum) or Cu (copper) used as a heat  
 
radiator. Recently, scale and degree of integration of the 
devices have been increased. Therefore, the material 
constituting a semiconductor substrate is further required 
to have a high coefficient of thermal conductivity, in 
terms of heat sink function for effectively remove thermal 
energy from the semiconductor device. In view of the foregoing, a material having 
coefficient of thermal conductivity of at least 
0.2cal/cm·sec·°C and coefficient of thermal expansion in 
the range of 5 x 10⁻⁶ to 10 x 10⁻⁶/°C has been in greater 
demand. Under these circumstances, materials satisfying the 
aforementioned conditions include BeO, AℓN, Cu-Mo alloy 
and Cu-W alloy, as shown in Fig. 11. A composite material 
including SiC porous structure impregnating Aℓ or Aℓ-Si 
alloy satisfies these properties, and therefore 
application of this composite material to such application 
has been studied. The composite material is, more 
specifically, an SiC porous structure of 50 to 72 volume 
%, with 14 to 30 volume % of Aℓ₂O₃ and 9 to 20 volume % of 
Ni-Si-Aℓ alloy or Aℓ-Si alloy being impregnated thereinto. Recently, reduction in weight of various industrial 
equipments and particularly aerospace and aircraft 
equipments has been strongly desired, and therefore  
 
reduction in weight of a heat sink is also desired. 
However, BeO, AℓN, Cu-Mo alloy, Cu-W alloy or the 
aforementioned composite material which are listed as 
materials satisfying the above described properties (heat 
conductivity,
