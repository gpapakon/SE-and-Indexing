<DESCRIPTION>
 NHR CONTRAST AGENTSThis invention relates to an improved method of magnetic resonance imaging of the liver using contrast agents not previously proposed for this purpose and to the use of such contrast agents in diagnostic imaging of the liver.The use of paramagnetic ions of transition metal and rare earth elements such as iron, manganese and gadolinium in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents for diagnostic purposes is well documented, enhanced contrast being achieved by the effect of the magnetic field of the paramagnetic species in increasing the nuclear spin relaxation rates of non-zero spin nuclei (generally water protons) associated with or in contact with particular biological tissue. It is furthermore well known to complex such ions with a wide range of chelating agents i order to reduce their toxicity and facilitate their administration, e.g. by confering or enhancing water solubility. One particularly effective class of chelating agents for this purpose comprises aminopolycarboxylic acids and derivatives thereof, e.g as described in US-A-2407645 (Bersworth) , EP-A-71564 (Schering) , EP-A-130934 (Schering) , EP-A-165728 (NyÏƒomed) , US-A-4647447 (Schering) , US-A-4826673 (Mallinckrodt) , US-A-4639365 (Sherry) , EP-A-263059 (Schering) , EP-A-230893 (Bracco) , EP-A-325762 (Bracco) , WO-A-86/06605 (Lauffer) , US-A- 4746507 (Salutar) , EP-A-290047 (Salutar) , WO-A-90/01024 (Mallinckrodt) , US-A-4687659 (Salutar) and EP-A-299795 (Nycomed) and in the documents cited in these patent publications; representatives of such chelating agents include DTPA, DOTA, BOPTA, HP-D03A, DTPA-BMA, TTHA, DPDP and EDTA.It is frequently desired that such MRI contrast agents should exhibit specific affinity for a particular 

biological tissue or tissue component in order to permit targetting of a particular organ. Thus the aforementioned WO-A-86/06605 discusses characteristics of chelating agents which encourage specific uptake of MRI contrast agents containing such chelants by human hepatocytes, so as to permit enhanced imaging of the liver. It is observed that chelant properties which cause preferential uptake by hepatocytes compared to reticuloendothelial cells also cause tight binding to proteins. Factors which are said to encourage such protein binding include (i) the presence in the contrast agent of hydrophobic groups, which bind to hydrophobic regions in the protein through van der aals interactions - the contrast agents thus preferably contain at least one, usually two, aryl rings and/or hydrophobic
