<ABSTRACT>
The device (100) comprises a storage container (1) for the powdery or granular casting agent (10), from which one or more screw conveyors (20, 20'), each of which has one or more discharge points (29) for the casting agent (10), extend over the surface (13) of a steel melt (15) situated in a continuous casting mould (14). A vibrator (9), which is arranged on the front end wall (6) of the storage container (1) and which makes the storage container (10) and the screw conveyors (20, 20') vibrate during the conveying operation, is used to fluidise the casting agent (10) in the storage container (1) and the screw conveyors (20, 20').
