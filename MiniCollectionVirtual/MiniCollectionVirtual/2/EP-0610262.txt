<ABSTRACT>
A combined display and electromagnetic digitizing input device for pen-driven computers. There is a graphics display panel having a viewing surface. A first grid (22') of parallel transparent conductors (32) for connection to electromagnetic digitizing electronics to sense the location of an electromagnetic stylus (18) is disposed over the viewing surface. A second grid (22') of parallel transparent conductors (34) for connection to the electromagnetic digitizing electronics is disposed over the first grid of parallel transparent conductors (32) electrically insulated therefrom and perpendicular thereto. The two grids (22') are constructed of flexible transparent substrates (24) carrying a plurality of transparent indium tin oxide conductors thereon. For improved performance, shielding (54) is provided in the form of a sheet of a transparent conductive material connected to ground potential disposed between the first grid of conductors (32) and the viewing surface as well as a sheet of a metal foil (56) disposed under the display panel across the extents of the first grid of conductors (32) and the second grid of conductors (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to digitizing tablets and, more
particularly, to a combined display and electromagnetic digitizing input device
for a computer.Digitizing tablets have been available as inputting devices
for use with computers for a number of years. Traditionally,
they have been used for digitizing drawings and for inputting to
CAD/CAM, desktop publishing systems, and the like. In the
typical prior art digitizing tablet system, the tablet itself contains
an X-grid of wires and a Y-grid of wires perpendicular thereto.
A stylus device is moved over the surface of the tablet and the
position of the stylus device is sensed in the X and Y coordinate
system defined by the X and Y grids of wires by interaction
between the stylus device and the grids of wires. Most typically,
the interaction is electromagnetic or electrostatic.More recently, digitizing tablets have gained greatly in
importance in their association with computers as the primary
input device in so-called pen-driven computing systems. In such
systems, the digitizing tablet is associated with a display panel as
depicted in Figure 1 and the combination is employed in the
manner of early, "light pens" and cathode ray tube (CRT)
displays wherein displayed choices on the CRT could be
selected by placing a light-sensing pen against the face of the
CRT. In those prior art CRT/light pen systems, the selection 
made by the user could be determined by the point in the raster
scanning pattern where the electron beam creating the display
was sensed by the light pen. By replacing the CRT with a liquid
crystal display (LCD) panel 10 and the light pen with a digitizing
tablet 12, a lightweight and portable input device is created.
Thus, as shown in Figure 1, a menu 14 can be displayed on the
LCD panel 10 and individual items 16 in the menu 14 can be
selected by employing the stylus 18. As can be appreciated, the
potential for such devices and pen-driven computing in
combination for various applications is virtually boundless.The pen-driven LCD/digitizer input devices presently
commercially available in the prior art are of several types. One
operates electrostatically and the others operate
electromagnetically. The electrostatic device is made by Scriptel
and its manner of operation is depicted in Figures 2 and 3. The
digitizing portion 60 comprises a sheet of glass 62 having a layer
of indium tin oxide (ITO) 64 disposed over the bottom surface
thereof. The digitizing portion 60 is then positioned over the
LCD panel 10. The stylus 18 is moved over the
