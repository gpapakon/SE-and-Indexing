<ABSTRACT>
A novel type of closure (2) is used for closing a medium flow channel (1) in a pipe system under pressure, in particular for closing a flow channel of a drinkable water delivery pipe system. The closure (2) consists of at least two elements (5) which receive the medium pressure and which are releasably coupled to each other by a joining piece (11) so that the closure (2) may be opened by removing the joining piece (11).

Closure for closing a medium channel of a pressure pipe system for a
pressurised gaseous or liquid medium at a closure area (3), in particular for

closing a medium channel of a conduit system for the drinking water supply
at the closure area (3), with a support element which, with support areas

lying radially outside in relation to a closure axis, effect an axial support of
the closure (2) in the medium channel and a transfer of the medium

pressure from the closure to the medium channel,

whereby the support element comprises
at least two carrier pieces (8, 8a) which are respectively designed with first
segment (10, 10a) extending in the direction of the closure axis (S) and with

a second segment (9, 9a) extending radially to the closure axis, and which -
together with the second segments (9, 9a) - form the support areas of the

support element, and
a locking piece (11) which is provided at least in part on the pressure-less
side of the closure, and from which the carrier pieces (8, 8a) stand off

radially with their second segments (9, 9a), and on which the carrier pieces
(8, 8a) rest with their first segments (10. 10a) in order to maintain the

closed state of the closure against such forces and/or torques which result
from the carrier pieces (8, 8a) being supported on the medium channel,
whereby the locking piece (11) can be moved away from the carrier pieces
(8, 8a) in order to release the support of the carrier pieces (8, 8a) on the

locking piece and on the medium channel, and thus to open the closure in
the direction of the closure axis (s),
characterised in that
the carrier pieces (8, 8a) designed as angled pieces or tapered pieces are -
with their first segment (10, 10a) in each case - connected with one another

to the support element via the locking piece (11), such that they can be
detached from one another again, in such a way 

that the closure opens by pulling off the locking piece (11) from the carrier
pieces (8, 8a), through the collapse of the support element.
Closure in accordance with claim 1, characterised in that the locking piece
(11) can at least partially be removed from the closure elements (8, 8a)

which take the medium pressure.
Closure in accordance with claim 1, characterised in that the locking piece
(11) can be fully removed from the closure elements (8, 8a).
Closure in accordance with one of the claims 1-3, characterised in that the

carrier pieces (8, 8a) are connected with the locking piece (11) for the
transfer of such forces to the locking piece (11) which act radially to the

axis (S) of the closure.
Closure in accordance with one of the claims 1-4, characterised in that for
each carrier piece (8, 8a), the locking piece (11) forms at least two resting

or support areas (13, 14), of which a first area (13) serves to receive forces
which act radially inwards, and a second area (14) serves to receive forces

acting radially outwards.
Closure in accordance with one of the claims 1-5, characterised in that fixed
on the end of the locking piece (11) facing away from the pressure side of

the closure is a pull element (4) which extends within a pressure-less part
(1') of the medium channel up to an area which is spatially distant from the

closure area (3) and at which the pressure-less part (1') is closed, preferably
through a closure cap (34).
Closure in accordance with claim 6, characterised in that at the end of the
locking piece (11) facing away from the pressure side of the closure, there

is a rod-like projection (20) extending away, whose free end can be 
connected to a pull rope, a pull chain or similar pull element.
Closure in accordance with one of the claims 1 - 7, characterised in that
carrier pieces rest with their first projection or segment (10, 10a),

respectively with one side facing the closure axis, on a radially inner first
resting area (13), and [rest]
 with a radially outer side on a second, radially
outer resting area (14) of the locking piece (11).
Closure in accordance with one of the claims 1-8, characterised in that the
carrier pieces (8. 8a) are part of a plate-shaped closure element which

closes the cross section of the medium channel (1).
Closure in accordance with one of the claims 1-8, characterised in that at
least one plate-shaped closure element (5) which closes the cross section of

the medium channel (1) rests on the carrier pieces (8, 8a).
Closure in accordance with claim 9 or 10, characterised in that the plate-shaped
closure element is equipped with predetermined breaking points, or

consists of several segment-like parts (36), which are held together by at
least one connecting layer (37).
Closure in accordance with one of the claims 1-11, characterised in that,
provided on the locking piece (11), is a bolt (15) which can be pushed in

the direction of the closure axis (S) by a given amount, which with a bolt
head (15'), tensioned by at least one spring element (19), rests against the

pressure side of the closure and which thus in particular holds the locking
piece (11) and the carrier pieces (8, 8a) together for the assembly or

installation of the closure.
Closure in accordance with one of the claims 1-12, characterised in that the
carrier pieces (8, 8a) form an oblique resting area (30) with which the 

carrier pieces rest on the medium channel and which with the closure axis
(S) forms an angle of less than 90Â°, which opens towards the pressure side

of the closure.
Closure in accordance with one of the claims 1-13, characterised in that the
carrier pieces (8, 8a) have, in each case, a bevel (32) on their radially outer

ends of the second segment (9a) on the side facing the pressure side of the
closure.
Closure in accordance with one of the claims 1-14, characterised in that the
carrier pieces (8, 8a) and/or the locking piece (11) and/or the closure

element (5) are cast or moulded parts made of plastic or metal.
