<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is a process for manufacturing a formed body made by pressing or deep-drawing and having different wall thicknesses from an initially flat sheet metal part. Such a formed body, for example a beam (1), having a thicker central area (1a) with a thicker wall, and areas (1b) with reduced wall thicknesses, is produced from a sheet metal part in a single piece with a thickness which corresponds to the largest wall thickness of the formed body (1) to be produced. Before being pressed or deep-drawn, the thickness of the sheet metal part is reduced down to the desired lower thickness exclusively in those areas where the formed body should present a lower wall thickness by rolling out or by another similar drawing out process. Material requirements and the weight of the formed body (1) are thus reduced during production, and at the same time a stable and highly load-resistant formed body is obtained, as the quality of the base material is not affected, as is for example the case when the formed body is soldered together from sheet metal parts having different strengths or thicknesses.
