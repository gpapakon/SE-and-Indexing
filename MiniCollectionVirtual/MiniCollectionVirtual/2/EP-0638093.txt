<ABSTRACT>
The amino acid sequence of the major coat protein of barley mild mosaic virus (BaMMV) and part of a non-structural protein is disclosed, together with the nucleotide sequence of the portion of RNA by which they are encoded. Also disclosed is a method of increasing the resistance of plants to disease caused by the BaMMV and transgenic plants having increased resistance to disease.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Title Novel Plant Virus Sequences^Field of the InventionThis invention relates to novel plant virus sequences and concerns novel amino acid sequences, novel nucleotide sequences, vectors comprising the novel nucleotide sequences, plants into which the novel sequences have been introduced, a method of increasing the resistance of plants to disease and transgenic plants having increased resistance to disease.Background of the InventionBarley yellow mosaic disease is one of the most important diseases of winter barley in central European and Asiatic countries (Inouye & saito, 1975 Descriptions of Plant Viruses, No. 143). It has recently been recognised that the disease is caused by two viruses: barley yellow mosaic virus (BaYMV) and barley mild mosaic virus (BaMMV; Kashiwazaki et al . , 1989 Annals Phytopathology Society Japan 5_5_, 16-25; Huth and Adams, 1990 Intervirology 3_1, 38-42; Prols et al. , 1990 Journal of Phytopathology 130, 249-259), although it was previously thought that BaMMV was a mechanically transmissible isolate of BaYMV. The two viruses have identical particle morphology being composed of flexuous rods with two modal lengths of approximately 275nm and 550nÏ„n and produce similar symptoms (Huth et al., 1984 Phytopathology Z 1H, 37-54). The particles encapsidate bipartite, polyadenylated singleSUBSTITUTESHEET 

stranded RNA genomes of similar size (approximately 8kb and 4kb; Huth et al., 1984; Prols et al., 1990). However, cross-hybridisation studies and restriction enzyme analysis have suggested that the two viruses are substantially different at the nucleotide sequence level (Batista et al., 1989, Plant pathology 38. 226-229 Prols et al., 1990). Furthermore, there is no cross-reaction in serological tests (Jianping and Adams, 1991, Plant Pathology 40, 226-231, Kashiwazaki et al., 1989a)Since both barley mosaic viruses are transmitted by the soil-borne fungus Polymyxa graminis, chemical control measures are ineffective and yield losses can only be prevented by cultivating resistant varieties. The resistance of many European varieties to barley yellow mosaic disease is likely to be due to one recessive gene (ym4) derived from the spring barley "Ragusa" (Kaiser & Friedt, 1989, Theor. Appl. Genetics 77, 241-245). However, a resistance-breaking strain of BaYMV has recently been reported in both Germany and the UK which overcomes the effect of the ym4 gene and consequently, it has become necessary to broaden the base of resistance to the barley yellow mosaic disease complex .
