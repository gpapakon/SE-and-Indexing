<ABSTRACT>
A method for automatically adjusting a drawer conveyor 
in accordance with the size of articles to be 

transported, the conveyor (1) running along a closed 
loop path and including transporting drawers (2) 

comprising a pair of walls (20,22) which define the 
dimension of the drawers. 
The method includes releasing one of the walls in a 
first section of the conveyor path, moving the 

released wall (22) in a second section of the conveyor 
path, until it is positioned at a pre-set 

distance from the other one, and locking again the 
previously released wall in a third section of the 

conveyor path. 
The conveyor includes an adjusting operating station 
located along the path designed to carry out subsequently 

on each drawer (2) that passes near to it, 
the operations described above.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a method for automatically 
adjusting a drawer conveyor in accordance 
with the size of articles to be transported. The 
conveyor which the method refers to, runs along a 
closed loop path and is equipped with conveying 
drawers comprising a pair of walls which define the 
dimension of the drawers. Currently, automatic packaging machines that insert 
products into cases, generally include three closed 
loop conveyors, placed side by side with their upper 
runs substantially coplanar. The first conveyor is equipped with stopping means 
for positioning of erected preformed cases thereon, 
the erected cases having at least an open side 
facing the second conveyor. This second conveyor is equipped with drawers for 
products which are lined up with the cases carried 
by the first conveyor while the third conveyor is 
equipped with pusher means operated transversely 
while they move along the upper run of the packaging 
line, so that the pushing means moves the products 
carried by the second conveyor towards the respective 
cases on the first conveyor, thus inserting 
them therein.  
 The drawers comprises lateral walls arranged transversely 
in respect to the transport direction, and 
are fed with product at the side opposite to the 
side facing the case carrying conveyor. The basic problem of the drawer conveyors concerns 
the possibility of adjustment of the drawers in 
accordance with the size of the products to be 
conveyed, that means to change the dimension of the 
drawers accordingly. For this purpose some conveyors have at least one of 
the side walls making up the drawers that is made 
movable in respect to the other that is fixed to the 
drawer support body, and the translation of said 
movable drawer is provided by different systems. For example, notches may be made in the drawer 
support body and may be spaced apart in the 
transport direction, the notches being designed to 
receive in engagement the movable walls that can be 
set in the most suitable position. This system, 
however, requires considerable costs and work and 
the machine being stopped at every adjustment. In accordance with a second system, that is described 
in the Italian Patent Application 
No.RM91A000091, the movable wall can be shifted to 
the suitable position, while the conveyor is in 
operation, by means acting along the advancement 
direction in a continuous way and coacting with 
translating means carried by the drawer body and  
 
linked to the movable wall. According to a third system, a

includes the following phases: 

releasing a wall (22) of a drawer (2) while this 
drawer (2) is running along a first section of the

along a second section of the said path, until 

the movable wall is positioned at a pre-set distance 
from the stationary wall (20); 
locking again the wall (22) previously released, 
when the drawer (2) is running a third section of 

the same path. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that an adjusting operating station (S1) is activated 

to carry out the said phases, and operates for a 
time necessary to all the drawers (2) to pass 

through the same station (S1). 
Conveyor automatically adjusted in accordance 
with the size of the articles to be transported, the 

said conveyor (1) running along a closed loop path 
and being equipped with transporting drawers (2), 

each comprising a pair of walls (20,22), said conveyor  
 

including: 

conveying means comprising a first stationary wall 
(20) and a second wall (22), this second wall (22) 

being adapted to take either the one or the other of 
two different configurations, namely a first configuration 

in which the second wall (22) is locked, 
and a second configuration in which this second wall 

(22) is released and movable with respect to the 
said first stationary wall (20); 
operating means designed to release the said second 
wall (22) of a drawer (2) while this drawer (2) is 

running a first section of the said closed loop 
path, to keep the same wall (22) free while the 

drawer (2) is running a second section of the closed 
loop path, and then to lock the wall (22) previously 

released when the said drawer has reached a third 
section of the same path;
