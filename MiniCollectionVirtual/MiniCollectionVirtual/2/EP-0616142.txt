<ABSTRACT>
A method/system for updating, between system calibration operations, the 
value (134') of a monitored control parameter corresponding to clutch incipient 

engagement is provided. At calibration, the initial values of the parameter 
corresponding to full engagement (124), incipient engagement (130) and the difference 

therebetween (132) are determined, and thereafter, the updated value of the parameter 
corresponding to clutch incipient engagement is determined as a function of a current 

value (124') of the parameter corresponding to clutch full engagement and the 
memorized value of the difference (132).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method/system for determining the touch 
point of a controlled vehicular master clutch, and, more particularly, relates to a 
method/system for tracking the value of clutch control parameter (such as actuator 
displacement) corresponding to clutch touch point between system calibrations (as may 
occur at vehicle start up) without requiring an actual system recalibration operation. Automated vehicular master clutch systems and fully or partially automated 
mechanical transmission systems and the automatic controls for the master clutches 
thereof are known in the prior art as may be seen by reference to U.S. Patents Nos. 
3,478,851; 3,752,284; 4,019,614; 4,038,889; 4,081,065; 4,361,060; 4,401,200 and 
4,828,093. Briefly, in such automated systems, various drive line operations, including the 
engagement and disengagement of the master friction clutch, are automatically 
controlled by a control system, including a central processing unit, based upon certain 
measured, sensed, stored and/or calculated input parameters. Typically, the input 
parameters include engine speed, throttle position, transmission input and/or output 
shaft speed, vehicle speed, current engaged gear ratio, application of the brakes, 
condition of the clutch actuator and the like. For automatic clutch control, during normal operation, when starting from at 
rest or operating at a very low speed, the master friction clutch is modulated between  
 
fully disengaged and fully engaged conditions, i.e. is partially engaged, according to 
certain input parameters and logic rules. In one type of automated start-from-stop 
system, the clutch is modulated to maintain the engine speed at a set value above idle 
speed and/or to achieve smooth starts. Typically, the set engine speed value is 
throttle position modulated to provide appropriate starting torque and the clutch is 
moved toward engagement and disengagement, respectively, as the engine speed 
increases above and falls below, respectively, the set engine speed value. In another 
system, see above mentioned U.S. Patent No. 4,081,065, the clutch is modulated in 
accordance with throttle position, engine speed and engine acceleration. In such automated systems, the controlled clutch is quickly moved from a fully 
disengaged condition to almost the incipient engaged condition (i.e. the "touch point") 
and then modulated to full engagement. The term "incipient engagement" of the 
master clutch refers to the clutch condition wherein the friction surfaces
