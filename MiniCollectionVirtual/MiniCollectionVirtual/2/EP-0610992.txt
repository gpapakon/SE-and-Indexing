<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for providing a sheet 
pile wall in the ground, which method comprises: 


excavating a first well (1) by means of a drill head; 
subsequently excavating in a similar manner a second well (2), 
shifted relative to the first well over a distance; 
excavating the ground panel (3) located between the first and 
the second well by means of an excavator which is fitted 

with tubular guiding elements, guided by the walls of the 
first and the second well during excavation; and 
subsequently providing a pressure-resistant panel (4) in the 
formed trench. 
 
According to the invention, a prefabricated wall element whose 

edges have a meandering side face (9) is placed into the formed 
trench, the edges of the wall element are subsequently brought 

into sealing contact with the walls of the trench, after which 
the first well is filled with concrete, the side face of the 

edge of the wall element serving as shuttering to form a 
supporting nose engaging the side face. 
The invention further relates to a prefabricated wall 
element for carrying out such method.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for providing a sheet 
pile wall in the ground, which method comprises: 
excavating a first well by means of a drill head; subsequently excavating in a similar manner a second well, 
shifted relative to the first well over a distance; excavating the ground panel located between the first and 
the second well by means of an excavator which is fitted 
with tubular guiding elements, guided by the walls of the 
first and the second well during excavation; and subsequently providing a pressure-resistant panel in the 
formed trench. Such a method is described in non-prepublished Dutch 
patent application No. 92.01345 (EP-A-0 580 264). This known method is very 
suitable for providing deep partition walls in the ground, 
particularly because the excavating method ensures a proper 
connection of the ground panel to the wells located on either 
side thereof. The actual partition wall is formed by concrete 
poured into the previously excavated trench and filling both 
the trench and one of the adjacent wells simultaneously. While 
concrete is being poured, a support tube is present in the 
other well, which prevents this second well from being filled 
with concrete as well, since it must still be possible for 
this second well to function as a partition wall when the next 
ground panel is excavated.  
 The object of the present invention is to improve this 
known method and in particular to render it suitable for 
providing sheet pile walls extending less deep into the 
ground, while a significant saving in material can be realized 
and the method can be further simplified by omitting a support 
tube, to be provided in every second well and subsequently 
removed again. According to the invention, this object is realized by 
providing a method wherein a prefabricated wall element whose 
edges have a meandering side face is placed into the formed 
trench, the edges of the wall element are subsequently brought 
into sealing contact with the walls of the trench, after which 
the first well is filled with concrete, the side face of the 
edge of the wall element serving as shuttering to form a 
supporting nose engaging the side face. The use of prefabricated wall elements has great 
practical advantages, because these wall elements can be given 
such a shape, for instance an arched shape, that it is no 
longer necessary to fill up the entire trench beween two 
adjacent wells with a hardening mass. The wall thickness of 
the prefabricated wall element may be considerably less than 
the

A method for providing a sheet pile wall in the ground, 
said method comprising: 


excavating a first well (1) by means of a drill head; 
subsequently excavating in a similar manner a second well (2), 
shifted relative to the first well over a distance; 
excavating the ground panel (3) located between the first and 
the second well by means of an excavator which is fitted 

with tubular guiding elements, guided by the walls of the 
first and the second well during excavation; and 
subsequently providing a pressure-resistant panel (4) in the 
formed trench, 
 
   characterized in that a prefabricated wall element (4) 

whose edges (7) have a meandering side face (9) is placed into 
the thus formed trench (3), the edges (7) of the wall element 

(4) are subsequently brought into sealing contact with the 
walls (5, 6) of the trench (3), after which the first well (1) 

is filled with concrete, the side face (9) of the edge (7) of 
the wall element (4) serving as shuttering to form a 

supporting nose (10) engaging the side face (9). 
A prefabricated wall element for carrying out a method 
according to claim 1, characterized in that the wall element 

(4) comprises an arched center part (8) and thickened edges 
(7) with a meandering side face (9), said edges (7) being 

provided with means for closing off the trench (3) into which 
the wall element (4) can be placed.  

 
A wall element according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the means for closing off the trench (3) comprise 

inflatable hoses (12) arranged in the edges (7) of the wall 
element (4) and extending in the longitudinal direction of 

said edges. 
A wall element according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the means for closing off the trench comprise a metal 

strip (11) provided on each edge (7) of the wall element (4), 
said strip (11) laterally projecting from the wall element (4) 

and forming, together with the meandering side face (9) of the 
wall element (4), a mold to form a supporting nose (10) on the 

concrete pile (1, 2) to be poured. 
A wall element according to any one of claims 2-4, 
characterized in that the wall element (4) is built up from 

separate segments of limited height, a sealing strip being 
provided between adjacent segments, said segments being 

interconnectable by means of pre-stress bars (14) removably 
projecting into the openings (15) provided in the thickened 

edges (7) of each segment.
