<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine of formula (I) consists in that 3,3,5-trichloroglutarimide of formula (II) is reacted either a) with phosphorus trichloride or phosphorus oxytrichloride or mixtures thereof in the presence from the start of catalytic amounts of hydrogen chloride, followed by a conversion of polyphosphorus compounds formed into phosphorus oxytrichloride by supplying chlorine, optionally only after supplying further phosphorus trichloride, or b) with phosphorus trichloride and chlorine, optionally in the presence of phosphorus oxytrichloride as a solvent, followed by a dehydrochlorination of the reaction mixture and finally conversion of polyphosphorus compounds formed into phosphorus oxytrichloride by supplying chlorine, optionally only after supplying further phosphorus trichloride.

<DESCRIPTION>
A process for the preparation of 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyri- dine.The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine of formula Ifrom 3,3,5-trichloroglutarimide of formula II2,3,5,6-Tetrachloropyridine is a useful intermediate product in the preparation of various herbicides, fungici¬ des and insecticides, e.g., (3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl- oxy)acetic acid [BR patent No. 74,02900] and 0,0-diethyl-0- 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridylphosphorothioate [US patent No. 3,244,586] .Various processes for the preparation of 2,3,5,6-te- trachloropyridine (I) are known, including the following: 2,3,5,6-Tetrachloropyridine can be prepared from glutarimide by chlorination with phosphorus pentachloride. Thereby, a mixture of chlorinated pyridines is formed which can then be further chlorinated with chlorine to 2,3,4,5,6- pentachloropyridine which can thereafter be selectively reduced by zinc to 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine.2,3,5,6-Tetrachloropyridine can also be prepared by chlorination of pyridine or pyridine derivatives as, e.g., 

2,6-dichloropyridine, α-picoline or 3,5-dichloro-2-tri- chloromethylpyridine in a vapour phase at a high tempera¬ ture.The starting material can also be glutaric acid dinitrile, pentenenitrile, €-caprolactam or cyclohexanone oxime which by chlorination at a high temperature (400- 600βC) can be converted into 2,3,5, 6-tetrachloropyridine.These high-temperature processes are usually not selective as they likewise result in the formation of other highly chlorinated by-products which are to be removed.One such by-product is 2,3,4,5,6-pentachloropyridine which as mentioned can be converted, however, into 2,3,5,6- tetrachloropyridine by selective reduction of the chlorine atom in the 4-position. 3,5,6-Trichloropyridin-2-ol or mixtures thereof with 2,3,5,6-tetrachloropyridine can be prepared from trichloro- acetyl chloride and acrylonitrile.These processes primarily concern the preparation of 3,5,6-trichloropyridin-2-ol, and tetrachloropyridine is a by-product in the application of the procedures.Trichloropyridinol is preferably used for the preparation of 0,0-diethyl-0-3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridylphos- phorothioate, whereas tetrachloropyridine has a wider field of application, including, inter alia, the preparation of the above-mentioned phosphorothioate via hydrolysis of tetrachloropyridine to trichloropyridinol.2,3,5,6-Tetrachloropyridine can be prepared from 3,3,5-trichloroglutarimide by reaction with phosphorus tri¬ chloride, phosphorus oxytrichloride
