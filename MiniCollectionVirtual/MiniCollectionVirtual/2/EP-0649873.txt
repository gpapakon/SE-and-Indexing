<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a resin composition 
comprised of a hydrogenated block copolymer and a 
thermoplastic resin, and provides a resin composition that 
can obtain a molded product characteristic of a superior 
resistance to organic solvents, having a flexibility and 
also having good properties in respect of low-temperature 
properties and mechanical strength. Hydrogenated products of block copolymers comprised 
of a monovinyl arene and a conjugated diene compound are 
what is called thermoplastic elastomers capable of turning 
plastic upon heating. Molded products made of these have 
good weather resistance and thermal resistance, also have 
a rubber elasticity rich in flexibility and have the same 
strength and elasticity as vulcanized rubbers. On account of such properties, hydrogenated block 
copolymers have replaced conventional vulcanized rubbers, 
and are widely used as molding materials for sundries for 
daily use, automobile parts, light electrical appliance 
parts and various industrial goods.  
 The hydrogenated products of block copolymers (or 
hydrogenated block copolymers) comprised of a monovinyl 
arene and a conjugated diene compound are obtained by 
hydrogenating block copolymers comprised of a monovinyl 
arene and a conjugated diene compound (Japanese Patent 
Publications No. 42-4704, No. 42-8933, No. 43-6636 and No. 
48-3555, and Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 46-7291). Meanwhile, it is attempted to mix the hydrogenated 
products of block copolymers comprised of a monovinyl 
arene and a conjugated diene compound with various 
thermoplastic resins so that molded products made of the 
resulting compositions can be improved in impact 
resistance, flexibility, low-temperature properties and so 
forth. It is also attempted to mix the hydrogenated 
products of block copolymers comprised of a monovinyl 
arene and a conjugated diene compound with various 
thermoplastic resin and mineral oil type softening agents 
so that the resulting compositions can be used as 
substitutes for vulcanized rubber. However, the molded products made of such 
hydrogenated products of block copolymers comprised of a 
monovinyl arene and a conjugated diene compound have the 
disadvantages that they may melt or swell when coming into  
 
contact with cuts of petroleum distillates such as mineral 
oils, organic solvents or asphalt or with vapors thereof, 
and have a limit in their uses for themselves. In order to improve resistance to organic solvents, 
it is proposed to use a block copolymer
