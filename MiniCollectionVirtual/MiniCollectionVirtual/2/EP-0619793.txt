<ABSTRACT>
Aircraft with at least one set of two engines (4, 5) fitted on each wing (1), the engine axes (XX and YY) being parallel and disposed vertically above one another in relation to the median plane of the wing (1). Both engines (4, 5) are fitted to the same pylon having a unitary or composite structure and including means for attachment to the wing (1). Both engines are also longitudinally offset in relation to one another, one (4) being set relatively forward of the wing's leading edge (1a), while the other (5) is set rearwards of the wing's trailing edge (1b). The engines are so arranged as to reduce permanently the twisting moments acting on said wing and generated by each engine's weight and thrust. Application in fixed or variable geometry aircraft.
