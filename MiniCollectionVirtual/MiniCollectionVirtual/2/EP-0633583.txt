<ABSTRACT>
A solid electrolytic capacitor has an anode body (1), with 
an anode body lead (2) being set therein, formed of a 

valve-action metal, and sequentially provided thereon are a 
dielectric oxide layer (4), a manganese dioxide layer (5) 

as a first semiconductor oxide layer, a manganese dioxide 
layer (6) containing graphite particles as a second semiconductor 

oxide layer, a graphite layer (7a), and a metal 
layer (8a) either in a silver paste layer or a nickel 

plated layer. The manganese dioxide layer (6) containing 
graphite particles possesses characteristics as in both the 

semiconductor oxide layer and the graphite layer so that 
the interface resistance and the impedance are reduced and 

there is no development of cracks and separations which may 
otherwise develop in the interface between the semiconductor 

oxide layer and the graphite layer caused by high 
temperature, high humidity and high pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid electrolytic 
capacitor, and more particularly to a cathode lead-out 
structure of the solid electrolytic capacitor and a method 
for fabricating the same. A conventional solid electrolytic capacitor of the 
kind to which the present invention relates is shown in 
Fig. 1A. in fabricating such capacitor, particles of 
valve-action metal such as tantalum and aluminum are pressure-molded 
into an anode body 1, in which an anode body 
lead 2 of valve-action metal is set and which is sintered 
in vacuum. A dielectric oxide coat layer 4 is formed on an 
outer peripheral surface of the anode body 1 by way of an 
oxidation process of the anode body. Then, a semiconductor 
oxide layer 5 of such as manganese dioxide is formed as an 
opposing electrode of the capacitor on an outer peripheral 
surface of the dielectric oxide coat layer 4, a graphite 
layer 7a for reducing contact resistance is formed on the 
semiconductor oxide layer 5, and a silver paste layer 8a is 
formed on the graphite layer 7a to complete the fabrication  
 
of the capacitor. A combination of the respective cathode 
layers, i.e., the semiconductor oxide layer 5, graphite 
layer 7a and silver paste layer 8a forms a combined cathode 
electrode of the capacitor. The capacitor element fabricated as above suffers from 
such problems that, since strength of mechanical contact 
between the respective cathode layers is weak, the electrical 
conductivity deteriorates due to the development of 
cracks and separations caused by such conditions as high 
temperature, high humidity and high pressure, and accordingly 
the dielectric loss and the impedance are increased. 
As for suppressing the deterioration of the electric conductivity, 
Japanese Patent Application Kokoku Publication 
No. Hei 2-11009 discloses a fabrication method in which, as 
shown in Fig. 1B, the element formed up to the semiconductor 
oxide layer 5 using the same material and the same 
fabrication steps as those used in Fig. 1A is dipped in 
graphite paste into which particles of palladium are mixed, 
followed by a drying process thereby forming a palladium-containing 
graphite layer 7b. Then, non-electrolytic 
plating is provided on the palladium-containing graphite 
layer 7b thereby forming a non-electrolytic nickel plated 
layer 8b. As already pointed out, the capacitor element fabricated 
as above suffers from problems such that, when used  
 
under high temperature, high humidity and high pressure 
conditions, there develop cracks and
