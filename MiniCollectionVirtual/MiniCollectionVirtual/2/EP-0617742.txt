<ABSTRACT>
Process and device for the production of fibrous starch materials through extrusion of a dispersion or aqueous solution of starch material in a flow of saline coagulant, in which the dispersion or aqueous solution is extruded through a microporous tubular wall in a chamber circularly ringed with said microporous wall in such a way to obtain an extrusion flux of the starch material which surrounds the said tubular walls and the coagulation of the extrusion is carried out by feeding the flow of the coagulation agent in the annular chamber parallel to the extrusion surface. The said obtained fibres in particular have applications in the paper sector in substitution for or in combination with cellulose fibres.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a device and process for
production of fibrous starch materials particularly destined for use in
the production of paper and cardboard.It is known that if aqueous colloid dispersions of starch in
typical concentrations of between 5 and 40% by weight of
anhydrous solid, is brought into contact with non-solvents (for
example a saline solution of ammonium sulphate), it coagulates
forming flakes of gel. US-A-4,243,480 describes such a process.
GB-A-2258251 describes a process for producing a starch pulp
comprising jet cooking an aqueous starch suspension, injecting this
into a primary flux of a coagulating agent to obtain the pulp and
subjecting the pulp to maturing in its own mother liquors.US Patent No. 4,205,025 describes a process for the
production of fibrils used as paper pulp using film forming polymers
including substantially water-soluble starches. By the term "fibrils",
materials showing a hybrid morphology which is between a film and
a fibre are intended. The film forming polymer is dissolved in water
to form a solution which is then injected into a precipitating means,
preferably an organic non-solvent, such as an alcohol or a ketone,
with the application of shearing stress in order to obtain the
formation of fibrils which are then renumbered more hydrophobic
through subsequent treatment in an insolublising agent.US Patent No. 4,340,442 describes a process for the
formation of fibrils which, in order to improve the hydrophobic
properties of the fibrils, uses starch insoluble in water having a high
amylose content (50-80% by weight), which is coagulated in a saline
solution, in particular ammonium sulphate. Said starch which is
substantially insoluble in water, requires a stage in which it is
dissolved in alkaline solution which causes problems in the
coagulation stage and problems with respect to disposal 
of sulphates different from ammonium salts, which are formed in
said stage.US Patent No. 4,139,699 describes a process for the production
of a product having starch fibre morphology, through extrusion
of a colloidal starch dispersion having a high
amylopectin content in a coagulating agent. In the case where a
starch having a amylopectin content of less than approximately
95% is used, it is necessary to chemically modify the starch to
ensure the colloidal dispersion thereof in the aqueous system
or, alternatively, the starch must be dissolved in the presence
of alkaline hydroxides.The use of alkaline hydroxides, particularly sodium
hydroxide, makes the
