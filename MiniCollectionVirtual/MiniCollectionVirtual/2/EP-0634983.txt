<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for controlling the electrical functions in a plurality of different locations of a vehicle comprises a plurality of electrical control units connected to a data bus (23) and distributed throughout the vehicle. All control units are identical and all are programmed to carry out all the electrical functions of the vehicle. Each unit incorporates means to detect the resistance at the point at which it is connected into the circuitry and to compare that resistance with the stored table of resistance and to select on the basis of that comparison the program for operation appropriate to the particular location in which the unit is disposed. In this way only one unit needs to be certified and units may be switched from location to location to provide a "get you home" service should one of the units fail in a particularly critical location.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electronic control 
systems for vehicles. Modern day vehicles are electrically extremely 
complex. This demand for complexity has led to an ever 
increasing complexity of the vehicle wiring harness 
through which the electrical equipment of the vehicles 
are powered and controlled. It has been proposed to 
supply each item of electrical equipment via an 
intelligent control unit. In accordance with that 
proposal each control unit would be specifically tailored 
to the particular associated item of equipment. Whilst 
such an arrangement appears superficially to afford the 
most economic and technically satisfactory solution, on 
closer analysis this may not in fact be the case. 
Tailoring control units to specific tasks involves more 
certification and increased development costs. Current 
European and International certification requirements for 
electronic circuitry for vehicles are set out in 
72/245/EEC, ECE 10 and CSA C108A. This certification 
procedure includes testing a particular unit for 
electromagnetic compatibility. If, following the 
certification of a particular unit, that unit is changed 
either by altering its hardware or its software, the unit 
must be recertified. This recertification involves  
 
considerable further costs which are additional to the development costs 
inherent in the change. Furthermore, tailoring control units to specific 
tasks inevitably means that units cannot be interchanged. This reduces 
manufacturing flexibility and ability to provide an immediate temporary 
solution in an emergency, for example, by replacing a faulty unit in a 
priority position by a satisfactory working unit provided as a spare or from 
a non-priority position. US-A-4,293,947 discloses a system having a 
number of identical units on which a corresponding number of addresses 
may be encoded, but there is no disclosure as tohow thosse units are 
programmed to carry their specific allotted tasks. According to the present invention there is provided apparatus for 
controlling the electrical functions in a plurality of different locations of a 
vehicle comprising a plurality of identical electronic control units each of 
which is disposed to control electrical function(s) in a particular one of 
those locations, and a plurality of activation devices disposed to feed 
control signals to one or more of the units under the control of a vehicle 
occupant wherein the control units are programmed to control all the 
functions in all the locations and comprise means

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for controlling the electrical functions in a plurality of 
different locations of a vehicle (1) comprising a plurality of identical 

electronic control units (11, 12, 14 to 17, 30 to 42) each of which is 
disposed to control electrical function(s) in a particular one of those 

locations, and a plurality of activation devices (43, 44) disposed to feed 
control signals to one or more of the units under the control of a vehicle 

occupant characterised in that the control units are programmed to 
control all the functions in all the locations and comprise means for 

identifying (ECUID) which program to activate in dependence upon the 
particular location of the unit whereby one unit may be substituted for 

another where necessary. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, in which electronic control units are 
provided for respectively controlling front left, front right and rear lamp 

clusters. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which each unit (11, 12, 14 to 
17, 30 TO 42) comprises one o
r more inputs (I) for receiving signals 
from one or more activation devices, and output for feeding current to 

devices to be controlled. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 3, in which one or more of the  
 

activation devices comprises a switch (19). 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the means for 
identifying (ECUID) comprises a comparator for comparing the resistance 

of the circuit at the location of the unit with a table of resistances stored 
in the unit. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, in which each unit (11, 12, 
14, to 17, 30 to 42) comprises circuitry for activating the unit from a 

normally quiescent state. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, in which each unit (11, 12, 
14 to 17, 30 to 42) comprpises an EPROM for storing all the programs to 

control all the functions. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim in which each unit (11, 12, 
14 to 17, 30 to 42) comprises an E
2
PROM for storing data which is to be 
retained when the unit is disconnected or off.
