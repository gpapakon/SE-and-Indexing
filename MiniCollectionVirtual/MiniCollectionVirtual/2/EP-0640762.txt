<ABSTRACT>
Electronic engine control module for an internal combustion engine which, without camshaft sensors, performs the synchronisation (unambiguous allocation of fuel injection and ignition to the individual cylinders), in that ignition and fuel injection of the internal combustion engine are operated in groups from starting until a stable operating condition is attained and either the ignition or the fuel injection for a specific cylinder is interrupted on attainment of the stable operating condition. An expected misfire caused thereby is (not) detected and all cylinders can accordingly be synchronised.

<CLAIMS>
Method for synchronizing sequential fuel or 
ignition distribution with the cylinders (I, II, III, IV) 

of a four-stroke internal combustion engine with an even 
number of cylinders as a function of the signals from a 

crankshaft sensor, two cylinders, the pistons of which 
each have the same position and direction of movement, 

always forming a group (A: I+IV, B: II+III), characterized 
in that the fuel injection and ignition are carried 

out jointly for each group (A, B) from the starting of 
the engine until a predetermined engine operating state 

is reached, in that, after the predetermined engine 
operating state is reached, either fuel injection or 

ignition of a predetermined cylinder (I) is discontinued 
for at least one engine stroke, in that, if combustion 

has not taken place within two engine cycles (work 
cycles) which commence with the engine stroke in which 

fuel injection or ignition is discontinued for the first 
time, distribution is synchronized with the predetermined 

cylinder (I) and, otherwise, with the other cylinder (IV) 
of the same group (A), and in that, after synchronization 

has been carried out, a change-over is made to sequential 
fuel injection or ignition. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that combustion which has not taken place is recognized 

when an acceleration value of the crankshaft is lower 
than a predetermined limit value (g).
