<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a semiconducting material 
comprises subjecting a selected class of hydrosilane 

compounds to hydrogenative condensation in the presence 
of a catalyst comprising at least one of metals or metal 

compounds of Group 3B-Group 7B or Group 8 of the 
Periodic Table, a mixture thereof with a specified silyl 

compound and/or a specified metal hydride. The 
resulting condensate is dissolved in a suitable solvent 

and cast over a quartz or stainless steel substrate, or 
a silicone wafer to provide a thin film having a 

specified conductivity and a specified optical band-gap 
(Eo).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of producing a
semiconducting material for use in the formation of
diodes, transistors, field effect transistors,
thyristors and like semiconductor elements.A gas-phase crystal growth procedure has found
extensive use in the production of thin films of
amorphous silicone or compound semiconductors in which
their low molecular weight feedstock in gaseous phase is
thermally decomposed or chemically reacted in high
vacuum to deposit on a substrate. This method however
would involve prohibitive costs to reduce to practice
for making large semiconductor films because there will
be required large-scale vacuum devices on one hand and
there is a limitation imposed upon the rate of film
deposition on the other.With the foregoing drawbacks of the prior art in
view, the present invention seeks to provide an improved
method of producing semiconducting materials at a
maximum rate of efficiency and a minimum of costs. DE-A-4 110 917 discloses a thermal treatment for producing
silicon carbide from a polysilane. The described process is
concerned with the use of certain metals as catalysts using
temperatures in excess of 800 degrees Celcius, 900 degrees is
examplified.JP-A-5 032 785 and US-A-5 252 760 describe a process for
producing a polysilane which involves a dehydrogenative
condensation by reacting a hydrosilane in the presence of an
organolanthanoid complex. The reaction is carried out in
solvent.EP-A-0 551 771 describes a process for producing
polysilanes by catalytic polymerization of a hydrosilane
using a catalyst mixture of a metallocene compound and either
a specific silyl compound or a specific metallic hydride.
The process produces a higher degree of polymerization than
that using previously suggested catalysts. According to the present invention there is provided a
method of producing a semiconducting material which is
characterized by subjecting to hydrogenative condensation one
or more hydrosilanes of the group consisting of :
   a hydromonosilane of the formula

   wherein R1 and R2 are independently selected from the
group consisting of a hydrogen atom and alkyl, cycloalkyl and
halogenated alkyl groups having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms,
aralkyl groups and halogenated aralkyl groups having from 7
to 12 carbon atoms, aryl groups having 6 to 12 carbon atoms
and silyl groups having the formula:
R3 R4 R5 Si-
   wherein R3, R4 and R5 are independently selected from the
group consisting of alkyl groups having up to 8 carbon atoms
and aryl groups having from 6 to 10 carbon
