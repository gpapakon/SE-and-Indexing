<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a superhard film-coated material consisting of a superhard film of diamond or the like, 
and a superhard alloy base material to which the film is fixed firmly; and a method of producing the same. According 

to the present invention, a superhard alloy base material is heat treated so as to deposit hemispherically on the surface 
of the base material a combined metal in the portion of the base material which is close to the surface therhof. This 

invention is characterized in that diamond and/or diamond-like carbon is formed by a chemical vapor phase synthesis 
on the surface of the base material by leaving the deposited metal as it is or removing the deposited metal partially 

or wholly. Owing to the formation of this deposited metal, the combining force of the superhard film and superhard 
alloy base material increases remarkably, and the formation of a thick film becomes possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a superhard film-coated member for use
in cutting or wear resistant tools, wear resistant parts and components,
optical parts and components, electronics materials and the like, which is
produced by forming a film of diamond and/or diamond-like carbon on the surface
of a cemented carbide substrate in a chemical vapor deposition process. The
term "superhard film" herein referred to shall generically means films formed of
diamond and/or diamond-like carbon.Chemical vapor deposition, in providing diamond coating on the surface
of a cemented carbide substrate, tends to produce amorphous carbon on the
cobalt in the bonding phase (hereinafter also referred to as bonding cobalt, and
such bonding cobalt and like metals in the bonding phase as bonding metals),
which hinders formation of diamond. As one solution to this problem, the prior
art, typically exemplified by Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho 63-20911,
discloses that acid etching the substrate to remove the bonding metal to a
predetermined depth from its surface has the effect of allowing formation of the
diamond film thereon and remarkably improving the bonding strength between the
diamond film and the substrate.Further, Japanese Patent Publication Laid-Open No. Sho 63-100182
discloses that a cemented carbide of which the content of bonding cobalt is
reduced by about 1 to 4 % by weight is suitably used as a substrate for diamond
coating, but that for diamond film formation such a low-cobalt cemented carbide
still requires acid etching to have its bonding cobalt removed.Alternatively, Japanese Patent Publication Laid-Open No. Sho 62-67174
discloses several methods of bonding metal removal, including dry etching the
substrate in a plasma of carbon fluoride, sputter etching with hydrogen, argon 
gas, etc., besides the aforementioned method using an acid.In the meantime, there has been proposed a formation of an intermediate
layer to improve the bonding strength between the diamond film and the
substrate without removing the bonding phase as above. For example, Japanese
Patent Publication Laid-Open No. Sho 63-1280 discloses forming on the surface
of a cemented carbide or a like substrate a layer of a carbide, nitride, boride,
etc. of an element of Group IVa, Va or VIa of the periodic table, or a compound
or a mixture of these, and then providing a diamond film on the thus formed
layer.Also, as to the thickness of the superhard film coating, Japanese
Patent Publication Laid-Open No. Hei 1-212491 describes that a thickness
