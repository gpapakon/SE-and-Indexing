<ABSTRACT>
A regenerative pump comprises a housing (1), an impeller (5) 
within the housing (1) having a plurality of vanes (13) spaced 

angularly around the axis of rotation of the impeller (5) and 
accommodated within a flow channel (4) within the housing (1) 

extending between an inlet (19) and an outlet (20), a flow 
stripper (17) located between the inlet (19) and outlet (20) 

and through which the vanes (13) pass, a fluid flow loop (27) 
in the stripper (17) which intersects the path of rotation of 

the vanes (13), and control means (26) to control the flow of 
fluid through the loop (27) so as to vary the annular motion 

transferred to the fluid downstream of the stripper (17), 
thereby to selectively vary the output of the pump. The flow 

stripper (17) comprises a land portion (21) upstream of the 
loop (27) which restricts direct fluid flow through the 

stripper (17), and the control means (26) comprises valve means 

which controls a supply of fluid to the upstream end of the 
loop (27). The supply of fluid to the loop (27) is tapped 

from a high pressure region of the pump possibly via a second 
fluid flow loop (22) in the stripper (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to regenerative pumps. Regenerative pumps comprise a housing with a fluid inlet and 
a fluid outlet, and an impeller rotatably mounted within the 
housing and having a plurality of vanes spaced angularly around 
the axis of rotation of the impeller and accommodated within 
a flow channel within the housing extending between the inlet 
and outlet, the vanes serving to induce a spiral or helical 
flow of fluid along the length of the flow channel as the 
impeller is rotated. The spiral flow is induced by the 
centrifugal and frictional effects of the vanes on the fluid 
and causes the fluid to be re-circulated repeatedly across a 
plurality of the vanes between the inlet and outlet, thereby 
progressively increasing the fluid pressure. A stripper block 
is located between the inlet and outlet and has sufficient 
clearance with the impeller and vanes to allow them to pass but 
to restrict direct fluid flow from the higher pressure fluid 
outlet to the lower pressure fluid inlet. In a known type of regenerative pump, an annular core is 
provided in the flow channel and the fluid flows in said spiral 
path about the core. The vanes project from the impeller into 
the flow channel and either terminate just short of a fixed 
core or are connected to the core so that the core rotates with 
the rotor. The vanes may have an aerofoil or curved cross-section  
 
to enhance the fluid flow effects, and means may be 
provided to assist the initial spiral flow of fluid at the 
inlet. An example of such a regenerative pump is shown in 
British Patent No. 2068461. British Patent No. 2074242 discloses a regenerative pump in 
which fluid flows in a spiral path about a core between an 
inlet and outlet, and which incorporates a stripper block 
between the inlet and outlet that serves to preserve the 
annular motion of the fluid as it passes with the vanes of the 
impeller through the stripper block. This is achieved by 
providing a fluid flow loop in the stripper block which 
intersects the path of the rotation of the vanes. The fluid 
flow loop may comprise one or more closed loops each of which 
is formed by a separate duct which re-circulates the fluid 
through the vanes, or may comprise a single quasi-helical loop 
formed by a succession of ducts between the outlet and inlet 
side of the stripper block. In the latter arrangement, the 
quasi-helical flow loop serves to preserve the annular motion 
of the fluid to a maximum extent so as to maintain increased 
pump efficiency and pressure rise.

<CLAIMS>
A regenerative pump comprising a housing (1) with a 
fluid inlet (19) and a fluid outlet (20), an impeller (5) 

rotatably mounted within the housing (1) and having a plurality 
of vanes (13) spaced angularly around the axis of rotation of 

the impeller (5) and accommodated within a flow channel (4) 
within the housing (1) extending between the inlet (19) and 

outlet (20), a flow stripper (17) located between the inlet 
(19) and outlet (20) and through which the vanes (13) pass, and 

a fluid flow loop (27) in the stripper (17) which intersects 
the path of rotation of the vanes (13), characterised in that 

control means (26) is provided to control the flow of fluid 
through the loop (27) so as to vary the annular motion 

transferred to the fluid downstream of the stripper (17), 
thereby to selectively vary the output of the pump. 
A pump as claimed in claim 1 in which the flow 
stripper (17) comprises a land portion (21) upstream of the 

loop (27) which is adapted to restrict direct fluid flow 
through the stripper (17), and the control means (26) comprises 

valve means which controls a supply of fluid to the upstream 
end (28) of the loop (27) independently of any direct leakage 

flow through the stripper (17). 
A pump as claimed in claim 2 in which the supply of 
fluid to the loop (27) tapped from a tapping (24) in a high 

 
pressure region of the pump. 
A pump as claimed in claim 3 in which said tapping 
(24) is in a region of the stripper (17) which is upstream of 

the land portion (24) and is in communication with the outlet 
end (20) of the flow channel (4). 
A pump as claimed in claim 4 in which a second fluid 
flow loop (22) in the stripper connects the outlet end (20) of 

the flow channel (4) to said tapping (24). 
A pump as claimed in any one of the preceding claims 
in which the control means (26) operates to switch said supply 

of fluid between the first loop or a dump point within the 
pump.
