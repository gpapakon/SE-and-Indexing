<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for making a 
lithographic printing plate, in particular to a method wherein a 
lithographic printing plate precursor having a flexible support, 
e.g. a polyester film support is used. Lithographic printing is the process of printing from specially 
prepared surfaces, some areas of which are capable of accepting ink 
(oleophilic areas) whereas other areas will not accept ink 
(oleophobic areas). The oleophilic areas form the printing areas 
while the oleophobic areas form the background areas. Two basic types of lithographic printing plates are known. 
According to a first type, so called wet printing plates, both water 
or an aqueous dampening liquid and ink are applied to the plate 
surface that contains hydrophilic and hydrophobic areas. The 
hydrophilic areas will be soaked with water or the dampening liquid 
and are thereby rendered oleophobic while the hydrophobic areas will 
accept the ink. A second type of lithographic printing plates 
operates without the use of a dampening liquid and are called 
driographic printing plates. This type of printing plates comprise 
highly ink repellant areas and oleophilic areas. Generally the 
highly ink repellant areas are formed by a silicon layer. Lithographic printing plates can be prepared using a 
photosensitive lithographic printing plate precursor, also called 
imaging element. Such imaging element is exposed in accordance with 
the image data and is generally developed thereafter so that a 
differentiation results in ink accepting properties between the 
exposed and unexposed areas. Examples of photosensitive lithographic printing plate 
precursors are for example the silver salt diffusion transfer 
(hereinafter DTR) materials disclosed in EP-A-410500, EP-A-483415, 
EP-A-423399, imaging elements having a photosensitive layer 
containing diazonium salts or a diazo resin as described in e.g. 
EP-A-450199, imaging elements having a photosensitive layer 
containing a photopolymerizable composition as described in e.g. 
EP-A-502562, EP-A-491457, EP-A-503602, EP-A-471483 or DE-A-4102173.  
 Alternatively a lithographic printing plate may be prepared from 
a heat mode recording material as a lithographic printing plate 
precursor. Upon application of a heat pattern in accordance with 
image data and optional development the surface of such heat mode 
recording material may be differentiated in ink accepting and ink 
repellant areas. The heat pattern may be caused by a direct heating 
source such as a thermal head but

<CLAIMS>
A method for making a lithographic printing plate from an 
original containing continuous tones comprising the steps of: 


screening said original to obtain screened data 
image-wise exposing a lithographic printing plate precursor 
according to said screened data, said lithographic printing plate 

precursor having a flexible support carrying a surface capable of 
being differentiated in ink accepting and ink repellant areas upon 

said image-wise exposure and an optional development step and 
optionally developing a thus obtained image-wise exposed 
lithographic printing plate precursor, 

characterized in that said screening is a frequency modulation 
screening. 
A method according to claim 1 wherein said frequency modulation 
screening proceeds according to the following steps: 


selecting an unprocessed image pixel according to a space filling 
deterministic fractal curve or a randomized space filling curve and 

processing said unprocessed image pixel as follows: 
determining from the tone value of said unprocessed image pixel a 
reproduction value to be used for recording said image pixel on a 

recording medium, 
calculating an error value on the basis of the difference between 

said tone value of said unprocessed image pixel and said 
reproduction value, said unprocessed image pixel thereby becoming a 

processed image pixel, 
adding said error value to the tone value of an unprocessed image 
pixel and replacing said tone value with the resulting sum or 

alternatively distributing said error value over two or more 
unprocessed image pixels by replacing the tone value of each of said 

unprocessed image pixels to which said error value will be 
distributed by the sum of the tone value of the unprocessed image 

pixel and part of said error, 
repeating the above steps untill all image pixels are processed. 
A method according to claim 2 wherein said original having 
continuous tones is subdivided in matrices of unprocessed image 

pixels and all of said image pixels within a matrix is processed 
before a subsequent matrix is processed.  

 
A method according to any of the above claims wherein said 
lithographic printing plate precursor contains a photosensitive 

layer. 
A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said 
lithographic printing plate precursor contains a heat mode recording 

layer containing a substance capable of converting light into heat. 
A method according to any of the above claims wherein 
lithographic printing plate precursor contains a silver halide 

emulsion layer and an image receiving layer containing physical 
development nuclei and wherein subsequent to said image-wise 

exposure said lithographic printing plate is developed using an 
alkaline processing liquid in the presence of developing agent(s) 

and silver halide solvent(s).
