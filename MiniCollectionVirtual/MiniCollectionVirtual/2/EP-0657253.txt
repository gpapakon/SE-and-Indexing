<ABSTRACT>
The tool for a tool chuck (tool-holding fixture) of hand tools used for chiselling and/or percussive drilling has a clamping shank (1). The clamping shank (1) is provided with two diametrically opposite rotational-driving slots (2) open axially towards its free end. For axial locking of the tool, the clamping shank (1) furthermore has an axially closed locking slot (3). To obtain higher surface proportions of driving-side flanks, which are essential for the transmission of the torque, the clamping shank (1) furthermore has a longitudinal slot (4) and a further longitudinal slot (5). The further longitudinal slot (4) passes through the locking slot (3) in such a way that a shoulder face (3a) is formed. The further longitudinal slot (5) lies diametrically opposite the locking slot (3) and may have a greater clear cross-section as compared with the rotational-driving slots (2).
