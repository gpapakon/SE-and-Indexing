<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a process for producing 
tris(tribromophenoxy)-s-triazine. The process is 

characterized in that cyanuric chloride and an aqueous 
tribromophenolate solution are subjected to reaction in 

the presence of a tertiary amine. According to this 
process, the reaction goes to completion in a short 

time and the yield and purity of the product are high.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing
tris(tribromophenoxy)-s-triazine.Tris(tribromophenoxy)-s-triazine compounds as such
are known from French Patent 1566675 and from United States
Patent no. 4039538. It is also known
from United States Patent No. 3843650 and Japanese
Kokai Patent Publication No. 47-25232 that these
compounds have very satisfactory properties for application
as flame retardant additives to synthetic resins.
However, tris(tribromophenoxy)-s-triazine compounds as
described in French Patent 1566675 were of low purity
and could be made available only in low yield.The technology for production of tris(tribromophenoxy)-s-triazine,
thus far known from Japanese Kokai
Patent Publication No. 47-25232 and USP No. 3843650,
comprises dissolving cyanuric chloride in a ketone or
cyclic ether solvent and adding an aqueous or ethanolic
solution of a tribromophenolate. An alternative
process, disclosed in JP Kokai No. 53-116390, comprises an
alkali treatment in the presence of a phase transfer
catalyst in a heterogeneous solvent system consisting 
of water and an organic solvent.However, in the production system employing a
hydrophilic solvent, solvent recovery entails the
azeotropic inclusion of water in the recovered solvent
and this water can hardly be removed from the solvent.
If the recovered solvent is reused in the reaction, the
charge cyanuric chloride is hydrolyzed and the resulting
hydrolyzate contaminates the reaction system. This
causes a decreased purity of the product compound and,
when such product is added to synthetic resin, both the
physical properties and flame resistance of the resin
are adversely affected.In the production system employing a non-hydrophilic
solvent, as described in Japanese Kokai Patent
Publication No. 3-34972, tris(tribromophenoxy)-s-triazine
of high purity can be obtained in high yield
but prolonged aging was essential for carrying the
reaction to completion. However, when the tribromophenolate-cyanuric
chloride reaction system involves an
extended period of aging, cyanuric chloride is
hydrolyzed by water in its reaction with the tribromophenolate
so that the product tris(tribromophenoxy)-s-triazine
cannot be of high purity. To overcome this
disadvantage, in the production process employing a
non-hydrophilic solvent, it might be contemplated to 
use a phase transfer catalyst in an increased amount.
However, the phase transfer catalyst is so expensive
that it is uneconomical to use it in a large amount and
actually an increase in the amount of a phase
