<ABSTRACT>
A flow circuit for a flow meter comprises a fluid flow line having an upstream junction or reservoir at which the fluid flow is divided into an inlet stream to a fluidic meter and an inlet stream to a laminar by-pass resistor, and a downstream junction or reservoir at which an outlet stream from the fluidic meter and an outlet stream from the by-pass resistor are recombined, in which the combined operating characteristics of the junctions (if present) and the by-pass resistor are selected and matched to the operating characteristics required of the flow meter, such that the relative magnitude of the two fluid streams changes over the required operating range, whereby, at high fluid flow rate, at the top of the required flow range, the greater proportion of the fluid passes through the by-pass resistor, while at low fluid flow rate, at the bottom of the flow range, the greater proportion of the fluid passes through the fluidic meter. The invention also includes a flow meter comprising a fluidic meter (4) for placing parallel with a laminar flow by-pass resistor (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
FLOW CIRCUIT AND FLOW METERThis invention relates to a flow circuit for a flow meter which extends the operating range of a flow meter, particularly although not exclusively for gas metering, and to a flow meter incorporating such a circuit. The flow meter could be a fluidic flow meter, a vortex shedding meter, a turbine meter etc.The useful operating range of a fluidic flowmeter can be limited by the specification of an upper limit to the pressure drop across the meter when operating at its maximum required flowrate. This effectively sets a limit on the maximum meter size. Because the flow meter has a lower limit of operating Reynolds number, below which the meter does not function, fixing the meter size sets a minimum operating flowrate for the meter for a given fluid. There is thus a conflict between the need for a large meter at high flow rates, and a small meter at low flow rates, and one proposed solution is described in GB 2172966 - to have two meters and a valve switching between them - but this is relatively expensive and impractical. A basic object of the present invention is to provide a flow circuit and a flow meter in which the operating range is significantly extended.According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a flow circuit for a flow meter, the circuit comprising a fluid flow line having an upstream junction or a fluid reservoir from which the fluid flow is divided into an inlet stream to a fluidic meter and an inlet stream to a 

laminar by-pass resistor, and a downstream junction or a fluid reservoir at which an outlet stream from the fluidic meter and an outlet stream from the by-pass resistor are recombined, in which the combined operating characteristics of the junctions and the by-pass resistor are selected and matched to the operating characteristics required of the flow meter, such that the relative magnitude of the two fluid streams changes over the required operating range, whereby, at high fluid flowrate, at the top of the required flow range, the greater proportion of the fluid passes through the by-pass resistor, while at low fluid flowrate, at the bottom of the flow range, the greater proportion of the fluid passes through the fluidic meter.A second aspect of the invention is directed to a flow meter incorporating the above defined circuit. Hence, in accordance with this second aspect, there is provided a flow eter comprising a fluidic meter placed in parallel with a laminar flow by-pass resistor.In contrast to prior art proposals of by-pass
