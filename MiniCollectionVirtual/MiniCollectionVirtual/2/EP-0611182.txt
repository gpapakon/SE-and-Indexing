<ABSTRACT>
Process for removing arsenic from hydrocarbons, in which the solid scavenger is pretreated before being placed in contact with the feedstock to be purified. The solid scavenger contains at least one element chosen from the group made up of iron, nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, tungsten, palladium and chromium and at least 5 % by weight of the said element(s) is in sulphide form. The pretreatment consists of impregnation with a sulphur compound, performed simultaneously with reduction. The process for the removal of arsenic takes place between 120 and 250@C in the presence of 0-1000 mg of sulphur/kg of feedstock.

A process for the elimination of arsenic from a
hydrocarbon feedstock containing from 0 too 1000 mg of

sulphur/kg, characterised in that the feedstock with
hydrogen is brought into contact, at a temperature of

120-250°C, a pressure of 1-40 bars and a spatial velocity
of 1 to 50
-1
, with a retention bed comprising a support
and at least one metal selected from the group formed by

nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, tungsten, chromium and
palladium, 5-50 % by weight of said metal or metals being

combined in the form of the sulphide, and in that the bed
is obtained by offsite impregnation of a precursor

comprising said supported metal or metals, in the
metallic and/or oxide form, using an aqueous or organic

solution or an aqueous or organic suspension comprising
on the one hand, at least one reducing agent and on the

other hand, at least one sulphur containing agent
selected from the group constituted by :


at least one organic polysulphide mixed with
elemental sulphur,
at least one organic disulphide mixed with elemental
sulphur,
at least one organic or inorganic sulphide
eventually mixed with elemental sulphur,
elemental sulphur,
 
said impregnated precursor being subsequently thermally

treated before being brought in contact with the feedstock.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the hydrogen flowrate is between 1 and 500 volumes of

gas per volume of retention bed and per hour.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the feedstock comprises

10
-3
 to 5 mg of arsenic per kg of feedstock.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the metal is nickel.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the metals are nickel and

palladium.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the support is selected

from the group constituted by alumina, silica -alumina,
silica, zeolites, activated carbon, clays and aluminous

cements. 
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the sulphide form is

produced by offsite impregnation of the retention bed
precursor, using at least one sulphur containing liquid

selected from the group constituted by ammonium
sulphide, a colloidal suspension of sulphur in water, an

organic solution of sulphur, an organic solution of
sulphur containing compound(s).
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the feedstock is brought

into contact with the bed at a temperature of 130-200°C.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the metal content of the

bed (calculated as the metal oxide) is at most 30 % by
weight, the metal being other than palladium.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the palladium content

(calculated as the metal) is at most 0.2 %.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the precursor is reduced 

in hydrogen at 120-600°C before being brought into
contact with the feedstock.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the precursor is thermally

treated at between 100°C and 200°C in the second step.
