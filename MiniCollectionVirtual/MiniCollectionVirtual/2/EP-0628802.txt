<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for measuring the angle of maximum absorbance, 
Θmax, specific dichroism, ΔA/A, and absorbance, A of a sheet 

of optically anisotropic material is diclosed. A beam of unpolarised 
light from a source (40) passes through a sheet (S) placed in the 

optical path (20) to the detector (50). The detector includes optics 
assembly (60), polarisation filter (70), band pass filter (80) and 

photomultuplier (90). The polarisation filter rotates rapidly at freq., 
f. Polarised light intensity, I, detected at (90) is applied to the 

analysis subsystem (14) and the results supplied to the control 
recording subsystem (16). If the sheet material has a preferred axis of 

absorption (P), then the photomultiplier (90) produces a signal, Is, 
varying sinusoidally in amplitude at freq., 2f. When the angle of the 

polarisation filter (70) aligns with (P), maximum absorbance occurs and 
the angle is denoted Θmax. The absorbance of the sheet material is 

defined as A=log(F.Io/Is) where Io is the signal produced at (90) in the 
absence of the sheet material, Is the signal with it present, and F is a 

reflection loss factor. Specific dichroism is obtained from the formula: 

ΔA/A=2.(Amax-Amin)/(Amax+Amin) 
 
where Amax, Amin are the absorbances with the polarisation filter 

parallel and perpendicular to (P).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the detection 
of optical characteristics of sheet materials, more particularly 
to detecting absorption characteristics of sheet materials by 
polarization measurement methods, and most particularly to 
simultaneously detecting three optical characteristics of an 
optically absorbing sheet material at one or more 
predetermined wavelengths: specific dichroism, the angle of 
maximum absorbance, and the average absorbance. In the manufacture of molecularly oriented polymeric 
films and sheet materials, certain properties of the film, such as 
modulus and coefficient of thermal expansion, are related to 
the molecular orientation of the polymer. In a typical sheet 
manufacturing process both the direction and extent of 
polymer chain orientation vary across the transverse direction 
(TD) width of the film, while the orientation properties remain 
reasonably constant in the machine direction (MD). Variation 
of properties across the width of film is undesirable for many 
end use applications of the film. Therefore, measurement of 
uniformity of molecular orientation is important to fully 
characterize the film and to provide information for controlling 
the manufacturing process to make a more uniform product. 
Measurement of this molecular orientation has traditionally 
been done by labor intensive laboratory methods and results  
 
are generally not available in a sufficiently short time to be 
useful for effective control of the manufacturing process. Films in which the molecular chains are oriented are 
known to absorb plane-polarized light differently at different 
angles of polarization. This variation of absorbance property is 
known as "dichroism". The measurement of dichroism, using 
an intermittent source of monochromatic light having two 
discrete, alternating polarization vectors is disclosed in United 
States Patent 3,345,907 (Wada). The requirement for the user 
to adjust manually the orthogonal polarizers to the angle which 
produces the maximum dichroic effect and the intermittent 
nature of the measurement makes this technique time-consuming 
in the laboratory and impractical for on-line 
measurement of a moving sample. The measurement of dichroism, using a source of 
monochromatic light having a rotating polarization vector is 
taught by United States Patent 4,309,119 (Tumerman). This 
method, while an improvement over the method above-described, 
suffers from several disadvantages which reduce its 
utility for manufacturing operations. The
