<ABSTRACT>
Ultrafine particles of aluminum nitride having a 
morphologically anisotropic structure of columns, plates, or 

whiskers such that the ratio of thickness or width to length or 
the ratio of thickness to width or length of particle is not 

less than 1 are produced by thermally melting a binary alloy of 
metallic aluminum and a rare earth element in a nitriding 

atmosphere containing nitrogen. By this method are produced 
composite ultrafine particles which substantially comprise 

ultrafine particles of aluminum nitride having the 
morphologically anisotropic structure and ultrafine particles of 

the rare earth nitride which functions as a sintering auxiliary 
therefor. The composite ultrafine particles or an aggregate 

thereof are usable as a raw material for the production of a 
sintered article, a reinforcing material for various metal-based 

composite materials, a blast powder, and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to morphologically anisotropic
ultrafine particles of aluminum nitride having the form of
columns, plates, or whiskers, a method for the production thereof,
and a sintered article obtained by sintering a powder containing
the ultrafine particles of aluminum nitride mentioned above.
More particularly, the present invention relates to composite
ultrafine particles comprising morphologically anisotropic
ultrafine particles of aluminum nitride and ultrafine particles
of rare earth nitride, which are usable as a raw material for
the production of a sintered article, a reinforcing material for
various metal-based composite materials, a blast powder, and the
like.The sintered articles of aluminum nitride enjoy resistance
to heat, high thermal conductivity, high electrical insulating
quality, and light transmission properties and, by virtue of
these features, find extensive utility in various applications as
to heat-releasing substrates for semiconductors, printed circuit
boards, packaging materials for LSI (large scale integrated
circuit), light-pervious heat-resistant materials, and the like. 
Though these sintered articles of aluminum nitride are commonly
produced by sintering aluminum nitride powder, the properties of
the produced sintered articles are affected largely by the purity
and particle diameter of a particular powder used as the raw
material and further by the purity, particle diameter, and
manner of mixture of a sintering auxiliary to be added to the
raw material. For the purpose of obtaining a sintered article
of high performance, it is necessary that the aluminum nitride
powder to be used should possess high purity and fineness and
the sintering auxiliary powder to be additionally used should
possess high purity and fineness and should be mixed uniformly
with the aluminum nitride powder.As concrete examples of the methods heretofore used for the
production of aluminum nitride powder, the following methods may
be cited:
(1) a method which comprises directly nitriding metallic
aluminum and then finely pulverizing the resultant aluminum
nitride,(2) a method which comprises reducing aluminum oxide powder
with carbon of high purity and meanwhile nitriding the resultant
reduction product by reaction with nitrogen,(3) a method which comprises attaining vapor-phase synthesis
of aluminum nitride powder by utilizing the reaction of an
aluminum halide with ammonia, and(4) a method which comprises melting metallic aluminum with
arc or plasma in an atmosphere of a mixed gas of

A method of producing ultrafine particles of
aluminum nitride, comprising the steps of:


providing a raw material comprising at least a binary
alloy of aluminum with a rare earth element as an additive

element, thermally melting said raw material in a nitriding
atmosphere containing nitrogen and causing the resultant

vaporized aluminum to react with the nitrogen in said
atmosphere

characterized in that said raw material is an alloy
comprising 10 to 60 atomic % of aluminum and 40 to 90 atomic %

of said rare earth element, thereby producing a mixture
comprising ultrafine particles of aluminum nitride having a

morphologically anisotropic structure such that the ratio of
length to thickness or width of the particles is not less than

1 and ultrafine particles of a nitride of said rare earth
element.

earth element is selected from the group consisting of

yttrium, lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, scandium, gadolinium
and terbium.

earth element is an aluminum-yttrium alloy such that the
proportion of aluminum falls in the range of 20 to 60 atomic %

and that the proportion of yttrium falls in the range of 40 to
80 atomic %. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the volumetric ratio of said morphologically
