<ABSTRACT>
A coated abrasive article comprises a backing, a 
first binder on the backing, and a plurality of 

abrasive particles in the first binder. The first 
binder is a hot melt pressure sensitive adhesive that 

is energy cured to provide a crosslinked coating. The 
invention also relates to a method of producing such 

articles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to coated abrasive
articles and, more particularly, to such articles
which incorporate an energy cured hot melt make coat.Coated abrasive articles generally comprise
a backing layer to which a multiplicity of abrasive
particles are bonded. In one form, the abrasive
particles are bonded to the backing by a first
binder, commonly referred to as a make coat. A
second binder, commonly called a size coat, is then
applied over the make coat and the abrasive particles
to reinforce the particles. In a second form, the
abrasive particles are dispersed in a binder to
provide an abrasive composite and the composite is
bonded to the backing by the binder.Porous cloth, fabric and textile materials
are frequently used as backings for coated abrasive
articles. The make coat is typically applied to the
backing as a low viscosity material. In this
condition, the make coat can migrate into the backing
and accumulate in the interstices formed by the
intersecting warp and fill fibers of the porous
backing. This can result in the backing becoming
stiff, hard and brittle with a consequent loss of its
natural pliability. However, flexible, pliable, 
coated abrasive articles are desired. As a result,
it has become conventional to employ a presize or
saturant coat to seal the porous backing even though
this added processing step increases the cost and
complexity of manufacturing.US-A-4,163,647 "Method for
Producing Coated Abrasives," issued August 7, 1979 to
H. J. Swiatek proposes coating a cloth backing
material on its front side with a liquid
thermosetting resin in such a manner that the resin
does not permeate the interstices of the cloth.
Suggested liquid thermosetting resins include heat
hardenable phenol-formaldehydes.US-A-4,751,138 "Coated Abrasive
Having Radiation Curable Binder," issued June 14,
1988 to M. L. Tumey et al. discloses a radiation
curable epoxy-based make coat. Reportedly, the
radiation curable composition can be used to treat
the backing material; for example, by saturating it
or providing a front coat therefor.US-A-Patent No. 4,927,431 "Binder for
Coated Abrasives," issued May 22, 1990 to S. J.
Buchanan et al. discloses an abrasive product which
utilizes a binder formed from a blend of a radiation
curable monomer and a thermally curable resinous
material. The binder bonds abrasive grains to a
major surface of a backing sheet and can also
function as a backing treatment for the coated
abrasive article.US-A-Patent No. 4,240,807 "Substrate Having
a Thermoplastic Binder Coating for Use
