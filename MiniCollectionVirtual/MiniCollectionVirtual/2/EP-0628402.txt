<ABSTRACT>
- The subject of the invention is a method in which pre-impregnated fibres are placed on an expandable, extractable mandrel (6, 12; 15) which may or may not be recovered, which is then expanded inside a suitable shaping device (23), during the polymerisation of the composite material, characterised in that the fibres are wound and/or laid down in contact, forming, on the mandrel (6, 12; 15), with the axis (13) of the mandrel, a suitable angle which may approach or reach 90@ for the so-called circumferential fibres, at least these forming, on the mandrel, a sinuous line (14) or formed by discontinuous elements (T1 to T4), so as to permit the circumferential expansion of the said fibres during the radial expansion of the mandrel. - Application to the manufacture of hollow objects, especially connecting rods.

Method of producing hollow objects made from composite
material, provided with at least one access orifice, the said

method comprising in particular the steps of:

winding and/or depositing in contact preimpregnated
fibres on an expandable extractable

mandrel (6, 12; 15), recoverable or non-recoverable,
the said fibres being formed by

bundles of agglomerated continuous or interlocking
discontinuous filaments and being individual or

constituting one of the elements of a woven mesh;
expanding the mandrel within a suitable jig (23) at
the time of polymerisation of the composite

material;

the said method being characterised in that the fibres are wound
and/or deposited in contact whilst forming, with the axis (13)

of the mandrel (6, 12; 15), a suitable angle which may approach
or reach 90Â° for the so-called circumferential fibres, at least

the latter forming on the mandrel a sinuous line (14) or one
formed by discontinuous elements (T1 to T4), each not greater

than a complete turn of the mandrel after expansion of the
latter when the fibres constitute one of the elements of a woven

mesh, so as to allow the expansion of the said fibres
circumferentially when the mandrel expands radially.
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
fibres (F) are individual and wound so as to form

circumferentially or substantially circumferentially to the
mandrel (6, 12; 15), at the point of contact therewith, a

sinuous line, notably a sinusoid (14). 
Method according to Claim 2, characterised in that the
winding is carried out with a head (16) driven in an

alternating movement in a direction parallel to the axis (13)
of the mandrel (6, 12; 15).
Method according to Claim 2 or 3, characterised in that
the undulations (14) of the fibres put on the mandrel (6, 12;

15) extend over an integral number of turns, or a fraction of
a turn, of the said mandrel.
Method according to one of Claims 2 to 4, characterised in
that the magnitude and optionally the pitch of the undulations

(14) of the fibres are variable from one layer of fibres to
the following.
Method according to Claim 5, characterised in that the
said variations take place in the sense of a progressive

reduction of the magnitude of the said undulations (14) as the
external layer is approached.
Method according to Claim 6, characterised in that, in the
case of the existence of a nil or very small clearance (18)

between the jig (23) and the mandrel (6, 12; 15) covered with
fibres, before it is expanded, the external layer is formed

from fibres without undulations and purely or substantially
circumferential.
Method according to one of Claims 2 to 6, characterised in
that the magnitude and optionally the pitch of the undulations

(14) of the fibres are variable according to the angle of
inclination with respect to the axis (13) of the mandrel.
Method according to one of Claims 2 to 6, characterised in
that the magnitude and optionally the pitch of the undulations 

(14) of the fibres are, for the same angle of inclination of
the fibres with respect to the axis of the mandrel, variable

according to the distance to the axis (13) of the mandrel from
the local surface where the said fibres are placed.
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
fibres (F) are individual and formed by strands consisting of

interlocking filaments of relatively short length, put in

place by winding or deposited in contact, circumferentially or
not, the said discontinuous elements constituting the said

line being formed by the said filaments of the strands.
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
fibres (F) are individual and put in place by winding or

deposited in contact in sections, by cutting the fibres as
they are positioned, according to lengths of sections (T1 to

T4; T'1, T'2; T''1, T''2; T'''1 to T'''7; T''''1, T''''2) extending
over a fraction of a turn of the mandrel (6, 12; 15), a

complete turn or a little more than a turn.
Method according to Claim 11, characterised in that the
said sections (T1 to T4; T'1, T'2; T''1, T''2) are end to end.
Method according to Claim 11, characterised in that the
said sections (T'''1 to T'''7) overlap mutually in the direction

of their length.
Method according to Claim 12 or 13, characterised in
that, from one winding around the mandrel (6, 12; 15) to the

following, and/or from one layer of fibres to the following
(C1 to C4), the said sections are offset angularly, so as to

distribute, in the mass of the composite product obtained, the
intervals (19) separating two sections end to end or the

differences in thicknesses due to the mutual overlaps. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
fibres are warp (C) or weft (T) threads of a cloth, and in

that pieces of cloth (M1 to M3) are cut to the appropriate
dimensions and shapes and the said pieces are draped on the

mandrel (6, 12; 15) so that the warp (C) or weft (T) threads
are disposed circumferentially or substantially

circumferentially to the said mandrel.
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
fibres are fibres of a so-called unidirectional cloth, cut to

the appropriate dimensions and shapes and draped on the
mandrel (6, 12; 15) so that the said fibres are disposed

circumferentially or substantially circumferentially to the
said mandrel.
Method according to Claim 15 or 16, characterised in that
the said pieces of cloth (M1 to M3) extend over a complete

turn of the mandrel (6, 12; 15) with partial mutual overlap or
placing end to end.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 17, characterised
in that the expandable extractable mandrel, recoverable or

non-recoverable, is formed by the demountable assembly, like a
three-dimensional puzzle, of pieces (6, 6
2
 to 6
15
) whose shapes
and dimensions are determined so as to allow, after

polymerisation, the extraction of the pieces by removing them,
in a pre-established sequence, by passing them through the

orifice, or one of the orifices, giving access to the hollow
object to the produced, such a mandrel being covered with an

inflatable bladder (12) on which the fibres will be placed.
