 Improvements Relating to Board GamesThis invention relates to board games, and in particular concerns an improvement in game boards which are used in such games.Typically, a board game will include a board upon which play takes place. The board, in order to fit into the box may typically be a single thick sheet of cardboard or the like material f&ldjed, in, two, anά. which., is_ openerL for tha, play of the game.Usually, a board game will include counters, playing pieces, pawns or the like which are placed on the board, and are moved across the board in accordance with the play of the game. Board games constructed in the above fashion have been known for very many years, and largely still continue in use today.The present invention seeks to provide a novel form of game board enabling the extension of play on a board to enhance a wide range of board games.In accordance with the invention, a game board for a game board has at least two sections, one of which has an aperture or cut-out and said sections being arranged to be part of a game wherein in the play of the game a player or players move playing pieces on a first play surface on the first section of the board and on which play does or may lead the or one of the players to place the or one of the playing pieces in the recess or aperture so that it rests on the second section of the playing board, and the first section can be moved clear of the second section in order to reveal a second section of playing board on which play can take place in the subsequent playing of the game. 

It will be understood therefore, that the play area of the board is extended by the board being in several sections which will be located one above the other in one part of the play of the game, but the second section comes into play when a playing piece moves into the aperture or recess.It may be that the play areas of the respective sections relate to different types of board game so that when a player moves a playing piece into an aperture or recess and the first sec ion, o_f_ the_ board is_ removed, he_has_to.play another, type of game on the second section of the playing board.In one embodiment, the first section of the playing board has a circular aperture therein forming the means through which the playing piece or playing pieces pass when the first section is removed.The first and second sections may be hinged together and may be defined in a common sheet of cardboard or the like material defining the playing board.In yet a further and preferred embodiment, there are

1. A game board for a game having at least two sections, one of which has an aperture or cut-out and said sections being arranged to be part of a game wherein in the play of the game a player or players move playing pieces on a first play surface on the first section of the board and on which play does or may lead the or one of the players to place the or one of the playing pieces in the aperture or cut-out so that it rests on the second section of the.playing boarcL, ancL the first section can be moved clear of the second section in order to reveal a second section of playing board on which play can take place in the subsequent playing of the game.
2. A game board according to Claim 1 wherein play areas of the respective sections relate to different types of board game so that when a player moves a playing piece into an aperture or cut-out and the first section of the board is removed, he has to play another type of game on the second section of the playing board.
3. A game board according to Claims 1 or 2 wherein the first section of the board has a circular aperture therein forming the means through which the playing piece or playing pieces pass when the first section is removed.
4. A game board according to any of the preceding claims wherein the first and second sections may be hinged together and may be defined in a common sheet of cardboard or similar material defining the playing board.
5. A game board according to any preceding claims wherein there are two folded sheets forming the playing board, the sheets being adapted for temporary connection, for example by jigsaw type coupling, and the respective first sections of 


each folded sheet can be folded clear of the second sections to reveal the second section playing surfaces.
6. A game board according to Claim 5 wherein the playing surface when the second sections are in use is defined jointly by the said second sections.
7. A game board according to Claim 5 or 6 wherein the free edges of the second sections are capable of being joined temporarily, and. the. first, sections, are. appro imate]y the. same size as the second sections but are connected to the opposite sides from where the second sections are temporarily joined, said first sections being folded inwardly εo that their free edges lie adjacent and above the join region between the second sections.
8. A game board according to Claim 7 wherein the two first sections form a first playing surface and each has an aperture therein, and the player or players play on the first surface but when a playing piece is positioned in the aperture in either of first sections, that first section is folded outwardly to define a second playing board or a portion thereof which is provided on the upper surface of the second section, and the underside of the first section.
9. A game board according to Claim 8 wherein the second playing board is defined on four sections these being the upper surface of the two second sections and on the under surface of the two first sections.
10. A board game according to Claims 7, 8 or 9 wherein the first sections are hinged to the opposite sides from where the second sections are temporarily joined.
11. A board game according to Claims 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 


wherein there may be third and fourth sections, the upper sections being provided with apertures so that the play moves progressively from one section of the board to another, by virtue of the playing piece passing through the aperture or cut-out, and the previously played board section being removed or moved in order to reveal an under board section.
