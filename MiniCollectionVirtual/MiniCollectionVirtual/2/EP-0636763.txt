<ABSTRACT>
A drill collar section (22) of a drill string (16) 
(i.e. at the downhole end of the drill string) includes an 

electric transmitter/receiver assembly (26) which 
communicates with an electric/acoustic repeater assembly 

(28) which communicates with an acoustic transmitter/ 
receiver assembly (29) uphole of the drill string by the 

transmission and receipt of electric and acoustic signals 
through the drill string. With drill strings that include 

downhole motors (30) the electric transmitter/receiver 
assembly may be positioned above or below the motor. Uphole 

telemetry comprises an electric current induced in the 
drill string by the downhole electric transmitter (26). The 

electric current contains encoded information of downhole 
conditions and travels up the drill string where it is 

detected at the electric receiver of the electric/acoustic 
repeater (28). The received signal is processed to drive 

the acoustic transmitter of the electric/acoustic repeater. 
An acoustic signal containing the encoded information is 

induced into the drill string by this acoustic transmitter 
and permeates up the drill string to the uphole acoustic 

receiver (29). This received signal is processed and 
utilized to evaluate and/or optimize the drilling process 

or to evaluate the earth formations being drilled. Downhole 
telemetry comprises an acoustic signal induced in drill 

string (16) by the uphole acoustic transmitter (29). The 
acoustic signal contains encoded information of uphole 

commands and travels down the drill string where it is 
detected at the acoustic receiver of the electric/acoustic 

repeater (28). The received signal is processed to drive 
the electric transmitter of the electric/acoustic repeater. 

An electric signal containing the encoded information is 
induced in the drill string by this electric transmitter 

and travels down the drill string to the downhole electric 

receiver (26). This received signal is processed and  
 

utilized to command a downhole processor (i.e., computer).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
downhole telemetry system for facilitating the transfer 
of borehole and drilling data to the surface for 
inspection and analysis. More particularly, the 
invention relates to a measurement-while-drilling 
("MWD") system that senses and transmits data 
measurements from a downhole location to an uphole 
location. Deep wells of the type commonly used for petroleum 
or geothermal exploration are typically less than 30 cm 
(12 inches) in diameter and on the order of 2 km (1.5 
miles) long. These wells are drilled using drill strings 
assembled from relatively light sections (either 30 or 
45 feet (9.1 or 13.7m) long) of drill pipe that are 
connected end-to-end by tool joints, additional sections 
being added to the uphole end as the hole deepens. The 
downhole end of the drill string typically includes a 
drill collar, a dead weight assembled from sections of 
relatively heavy lengths of uniform diameter collar pipe 
having an overall length on the order of 300 meters 
(1000 feet). A drill bit is attached to the downhole end 
of the drill collar, the weight of the collar causing 
the bit to bite into the earth as the drill string is 
rotated from the surface. Sometimes, downhole mud motors 
or turbines are used to turn the bit. Drilling mud or 
air is pumped from the surface to the drill bit through 
an axial hole in the drill string. This fluid removes 
the cuttings from the hole, provides hydrostatic head 
which controls the formation gases, and sometimes 
provides cooling for the bit. Communication between downhole sensors of 
parameters such as pressure or temperature and the 
surface has long been desirable. There are a number of  
 
systems in the prior art which seek to transmit 
information regarding parameters downhole up to the 
surface. There prior systems may be descriptively 
characterized as: (1) mud pressure pulse; (2) hard-wire 
connection; (3) acoustic wave; and (4) electromagnetic 
waves. In a mud pressure pulse system, the drilling mud 
pressure in the drill string is modulated by means of a 
valve and control mechanism mounted in a special pulsar 
collar above the drill bit and motor (if one is used). 
The pressure pulse travels up the mud column at or near 
the velocity of sound in the mud, which is approximately 
4000-5000 feet per second (1200-1500 m/s). The rate of 
transmission of data, however, is relatively slow due to 
pulse spreading, modulation rate limitations, and other 
disruptive forces, such as the ambient noise in the 
drill
