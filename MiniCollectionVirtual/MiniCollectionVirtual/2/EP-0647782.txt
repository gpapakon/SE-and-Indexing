<ABSTRACT>
Wind paddle system having a wind paddle (3) which is formed by strips (10), preferably made from material, attached to the upper region of the mast (2) between struts (11) extending radially relative to the mast (2). The individual material strips can be angled in order to increase the wind attack area when the mast inclines. The wind paddle system configured in this way is cost effective and of low weight, and the wind attack area is set automatically by the wind pressure.

<CLAIMS>
Wind paddle system having a mast (2) pivotably mounted about any random
horizontal axis and resiliently held in a roughly vertical direction by a

righting force, a wind paddle (3) fitted to said mast, at least one fluid
delivery device (9) connected to the mast (2) and which delivers a fluid in

the case of a deflection movement of the mast (2), and a frame (8), characterized
in that the wind paddle (3) is formed by strips (10) fitted to the

upper area of the mast (2) between braces (11) running radially to the mast
(2).
Wind paddle system according to claim 1, characterized in that the strips
(10) are arranged parallel to one another between two braces (11).
Wind paddle system according to claim 2, characterized in that the
strip spacing is roughly the same as the height of the strips (10).
Wind paddle system according to claim 2, characterized in that the strips
(10) are bent away from the mast with their surface remote from said mast (2).
Wind paddle system according to claim 4, characterized in that in the
case of an undeflected mast (2), the strips (10) have a vertical surface (13)

and a roughly equally large, bent surface (12).
Wind paddle system according to claim 4, characterized in that with an
undeflected mast (2) the strips (10) have a vertical surface (14) and a bent

surface (12), the height of the vertical surface corresponding to half the
height of the strip.
Wind paddle system according to one of the preceding claims 4 to 6, characterized
in that the angle between the vertical surface (13) and the bent

surface (12) is 45Â°.
Wind paddle system according to one of the preceding claims 4 to 7, characterized
in that the spacing between the strips (10) is chosen in such a

way that with a deflection of the mast by the quantity of the inclination of
the bent surface (12), the latter is exposed to the vertically impacting wind

(7).
