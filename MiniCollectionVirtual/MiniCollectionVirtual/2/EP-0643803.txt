<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a sensor arrangement for cylinder identification in a multi-cylinder internal combustion engine with a crankshaft detector with an increment disc with a reference marking and a camshaft sensor with long and short segments and short and long spaces between the segments. The joint evaluation of the pulse sequences provided by both sensors allows to determine the length of the high and low phases. As the reference mark is also taken into account in the evaluation, the number of different segment lengths on the camshaft sensor disc can be reduced and the cylinder identified rapidly and positively. The evaluation of the crankshaft and camshaft signal provides for reliable control of the internal combustion engine. If the crankshaft sensor breaks down, the engine can still be run in emergency with the aid of the camshaft sensor.

Sensor arrangement, for cylinder detection, in a 
multi-cylinder internal combustion engine with a sensor 

disc which is driven by the crankshaft and has a multiplicity 
of angular marks and at least one distinguishable 

reference mark which is assigned to a fixed crankshaft 
angle, and a sensor disc which is driven by the camshaft 

and has a number of angular marks corresponding to the 
number of cylinders and having different lengths and 

different intermediate spaces, an angular mark and an 
adjacent intermediate space forming a segment, with 

stationary detectors which are assigned to the sensor 
discs and, as a function of the marks passing by, output 

output signals with low phases and high phases which are 
evaluated in a control device, characterized in that 

means are provided which count the number of crankshaft 
pulses between a front edge and a rear edge of the 

camshaft sensor signal and conclude the angular position 
of the camshaft from the count values obtained in this 

way, the arrangement being such that identical segments 
are provided, with low phases and high phases of 

identical size which can always be distinguished by means 
of the additional detection of the reference
 mark and 
thus an unambiguous cylinder assignment within a segment 

is possible with an extremely small number of different 
angular marks. 
Sensor arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that it is detected from the sequence of count 

values which cylinder of the internal combustion engine 
is in the upper dead centre.  

 
Sensor arrangement according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the rear edges of 

the camshaft sensor signal have identical spacings. 
Sensor arrangement according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that during the start 

an ignition output is added to the first rear edge after 
cylinder detection in order to ensure a quickest possible 

start. 
Sensor arrangement according to one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that in the event of a failure of 

the crankshaft sensor emergency running is activated and 
suitable edges of the camshaft sensor signal are used for 

cylinder detection and control of the ignition and/or 
injection. 
Sensor arrangement according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the sequence of 

the low phases and high phases of the camshaft sensor 
signal is compared with stored values which are to be 

expected, and in the case of deviation from these values 
an adaptation or correction is carried out.
