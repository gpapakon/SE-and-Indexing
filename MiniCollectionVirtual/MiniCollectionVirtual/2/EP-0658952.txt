<CLAIMS>
A female electric contact element and housing part intended
to receive one such element, said element being of the type

comprising a first part (1) created from a good electricity
conducting metallic strip and provided with a certain elasticity,

said strip being cutout and folded to show crimping tabs (2,3)
at one extremity, prolonged by a profiled portion (4), prolonged

itself by a body (10) having a circular section, terminated by
two flexible rods (7,8) intended to form a clamp to tightly hug

a corresponding male electric contact element (82) and a
complimentary part (30) secured on the body (10) and created from

a good electricity conducting metallic strip and provided with
a certain elasticity, said strip being cutout and folded so as

to effect a circular section to receive body (10) of the first
part (1), and having two flexible rods (49,50) intended to bear

against the flexible rods of the first part, and thus reinforce
the flexible action of these latter, whilst the housing part (71)

is of the type intended to co-operate with a complimentary
housing part provided for male electric contact elements, said

housing element having channels (75) each intended to receive a
female electric contact element, means being provided for locking

said elements, these means being capable of occupying a first
waiting position in which the female electric contact elements

can be put in place, and a second locking position in which these
latter are blocked, said female electric contact element being

characterised in that the flexible rods (7 
&
 8) of the
first part (1) are flattened, said complimentary part (30)

comprising on the one hand a retaining flap (46) whose free
extremity is turned from the crimping tabs side, and on the other

hand, comprises of at least a hump (45) in the region of its free
extremity, whilst each channel (75) has at least one hump (45)

guide groove (101). 
A female electric contact element and housing part intended
to receive one such element, according to claim 1, characterised

in that the complimentary part (30) of said element has on the
one hand, a tab (36,38) along the length of each of the two

opposing edges (31,32) intended to be abutting after folding, and
intended to be folded inwardly so as to be inserted into a slit

(19) in the body (10) of the first part (1) and opening between
the two flexible rods, and on the other hand, a tab (47) cutout

in an intermediary point of its surface, and intended to be
folded inwardly to be inserted into a notch (12) along the length

of said first part (1), and cutout in one of the edges (6) of the
body (10) intended to be abutting with the opposing edge after

folding said body (10).
A female electric contact element and housing part intended
to receive one such element, according to claim 1, characterised

in that body (10) of said element has a flattened part in which
a lug (15) is cut out, co-operating with the internal surface of

the complimentary part.
A female electric contact element and housing part intended
to receive one such element, according to claim 1, characterised

in that the flexible rods of the first part of said element are
terminated by edges (23,24) crossing the notches (39) of the

corresponding extremity of the complimentary part (30).
A female electric contact element and housing part intended
to receive one such element, according to claim 1, characterised

in that said element (30) comprises a tab (35,37) on two opposing
edges intended to be abutting after folding, and intended to bear

against projections (17,18) of corresponding edges of flexible
rods (7,8) so as to maintain a certain distance between them. 
A female electric contact element and housing part intended
to receive one such element, according to claim 1 and/or any of

claims 2 to 5, characterised in that the channels (75) of said
housing part (71) open out into an open part, in the base of

which are impressions (79) which correspond to the shape of the
female electric contact element, the open part (89) being

demarcated by an end wall (80) intended to limit the engagement
of the female electric contact element, and pierced by holes (81)

to allow the passage of male electric contact elements (82), said

open part (89) being demarcated by lateral walls (90), having
grooves (93,94,95) on their internal surface for guiding the lugs

(105,109) of a key (102), having complimentary impressions (103)
in its surface intended to be turned towards the impressions

(79) corresponding to the shape of the female electric contact
element, means being provided to maintain key (102) in a waiting

position in which its impressions are spaced from the impressions
(79) at the base of the housing part, so as to allow the

insertion of said female electric contact elements, and, when
these latter are in place, to displace key (102) towards a

locking position in which the female electric contact elements
are hugged tightly between said impressions.
A female electric contact element and housing part intended
to receive one such element, according to claim 5, characterised

in that lateral walls (90) of said housing part are connected at
an intermediary point in their length by a bridge (91), forming

a stop for the retaining flap (46,46
a
) of the female electric
contact element. 
A female electric contact element and housing part intended
to receive one such element, according to claim 5, characterised

in that each lateral wall of said housing part comprises three
grooves (93,94,95) on its internal surface, the intermediary

groove having a stop (98) with ramps inclined in such a manner
that they can be passed over, whilst the two other grooves

(95,93) comprise hooks (99.96) with sheer faces turned towards
the bottom, key (102) being provided with lugs (105,109) on two

opposing edges, intended to co-operate with the hooks sheer faces
and with stops (107) having inclined ramps (107
a
,107
b

position of the hooks, the lugs and the stops being such that

when the lugs bear against the hooks sheer faces, the key (102)
stops bear against a ramp (98
a
) of groove (94) stop, the key
being in the waiting position, whilst key (102) stops have passed

over said stops, the key is in the locked position.
