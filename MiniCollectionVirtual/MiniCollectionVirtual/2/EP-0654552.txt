<ABSTRACT>
The device contains an actuating member for the heald-frame lock and a receiving part (15) which, in the position of rest of the device, guides the heald staves (2) and, in the working position, retains the heald staves and consequently the heald-frame locks, in order to insert the heald frames. The device is arranged in a weaving machine underneath the heald frames (1), so that the receiving part (15) is located at one level and permanently guides the heald staves (2). The free space necessary for this purpose is provided by designing the heald stave (2) so as to allow for the ratio of the free stave length Lst to the maximum stroke height strokemax.
