<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluorinated achiral
smectic liquid crystal compounds. These compounds and
mixtures of liquid crystal materials containing these
compounds are useful in a variety of electrooptical
displays.Devices employing liquid crystals have found
use in a variety of electrooptical applications, in
particular those which require compact,
energy-efficient, voltage-controlled light valves, such
as watch and calculator displays, and flat-panel
displays as are found in portable computers and compact
televisions.Liquid crystal displays have a number of
unique characteristics, including low voltage and low
power of operation, which make them the most promising
of the non-emissive electrooptical display candidates
currently available. However, slow response and
insufficient nonlinearity can impose limitations for
many potential applications. The requirement for speed
may become especially important in proportion to the
number of elements which have to be addressed in a
device. This limits the potential use of some types of
liquid crystals.The modes of liquid crystal displays that are
most extensively employed at the present are twisted
nematic (TN), supertwisted birefringence effect (SBE),
and dynamic scattering (DS), all employing nematic
or chiral nematic (cholesteric) liquid
crystals. These devices are based upon the dielectric
alignment effects (Freedericksz effect) of the nematic
and/or chiral nematic liquid crystal or mixtures of 
nematic or chiral nematic liquid crystals upon
application of an electric field. The average
molecular long axis of the liquid crystal material
takes up a preferred orientation in the applied
electric field, the orientation of which is dependent
on the sign of the dielectric anisotropy of the
material or mixture, and this orientation relaxes upon
removal of the applied electric field. This
reorientation and relaxation is slow, on the order of a
few milliseconds.Although nematic and chiral nematic liquid
crystals are the most extensively employed, there are
liquid crystal devices that employ higher ordered
smectic liquid crystals.Devices employing materials with a smectic A
mesophase are useful in device applications as
described in Crossland, et al. U.S. Patent Nos.
4,411,494; 4,419,664; and 4,528,562; and F. J. Kahn
(Appl. Phys. Lett., vol. 22, p. 111 (1973)). These
devices are based on the dielectric reorientation of
the liquid crystals and response times are on the order
of milliseconds.Mixtures which exhibit a chiral smectic A
mesophase are useful in a device as
