<ABSTRACT>
An oscillating tool for sanding a surface has a body (12) defining an internal cavity (14) and a motor (20) located therein. The motor has a motor shaft (22) oriented in parallel with the body. A crank (24) is affixed to the motor which has a crank pin (26) projecting therefrom. A lever arm (34) is pivotably affixed to the body for rotation about a pivot axis generally perpendicular to the motor shaft. The lever arm cooperates with the crank pin to cause the lever arm to cyclically pivot back and forth. A pad support (18) is adapted to receive a work member (19). The planar pad support is affixed to the lever arm at a location spaced apart from the pivot axis and oscillated therewith. The pad support has a substantially 90 degree forward corner (110) formed by a pair of facet edges and a pair of outwardly inclined straight side edges (116, 118).

<DESCRIPTION>
 DETAIL SANDERTechnical FieldThis invention relates to an oscillating tool and more particularly to a mechanism for oscillatingly driving a sanding tool about a remotely located pivot axis.Background ArtDetail sanders are used for performing specific finishing tasks such as sanding edges adjacent internal walls. To perform such tasks, the tools utilized must be able to have controlled finite movement in a confined area so as to fine sand the desired area without damaging the surface upon which the work is being performed. Various approaches have been taken to perform the difficult task of sanding these internal corners and other hard to reach areas which require fine sanding or abrasion.Initially, hand sanders were utilized to perform these tasks. U.S. Patent No. 4,825,597 to Matechuk discloses a corner hand sander which has a sanding surface in the form of a prism having an angle of 90 degrees. Electrically operated tools replaced hand corner sanders similar to the one disclosed above. A common feature among the electrically driven sanders or grinders is that all utilize pivotal or oscillating motion or rotational motion to drive the abrasive pad.U.S. Patent No. 4,920,702 to Kloss et al., discloses a portable grinder relying upon pivotal motion 

by oscillating about a fixed axis which intersects the grinding tool in a central region. The abrasive pad has exposed side edges which are convex in shape such that side edges meet to form at least one corner region having an angle of less than 90 degrees. A similar pear-shaped oscillating abrasive pad for reaching into square corners is described in UK patent 2141620 to Brown.U.S. Patent No. 3,190,045 to Zuzelo, discloses an abrasive tool defining an equilateral triangle having three convex sides such that each side is curved in the form of an arc centered on the opposing vertex. The tool rotates about a central axis and has 3 corners which form approximately 90° angles for grinding or polishing into square corners.An alternative approach is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,160,995 to Damuski, Jr. in which a corner sander has an oscillating or reciprocating sector-shaped abrasive pad. The pad contains a pair of radiant side edges which move through a total angle just slightly less than the 90 degree angle of the corner to be finished.U.S. Patent No. 2,350,098 to Decker discloses an oscillating sander which has a sanding head which has an abrasive pad which is driven about an angle transverse to and at a right angle with the motor drive shaft.U.S. Patent No.
