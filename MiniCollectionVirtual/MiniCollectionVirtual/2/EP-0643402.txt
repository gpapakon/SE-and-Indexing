<ABSTRACT>
An inductive structure integrable with a semiconductor integrated circuit 
comprises an electrically insulating substrate (1) having opposed fist and 

second surfaces; an electrical conductor disposed in a spiral (2) spaced 
from the first surface of the substrate (1), the spiral (2) including an external 

end (3) disposed outside the spiral (2) as a first lead and an internal end 
(4) disposed within the spiral (2), said first spiral (2) including at least two 

windings adjacent each other; and a plurality of electrically conducting, 
spaced apart posts (25) disposed on the first surface of the substrate (1) 

contacting and supporting the first spiral (2), wherein each post (25) supporting 

one winding is disposed intermediate two adjacent posts (25) supporting 
an adjacent winding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to inductive 
structures, as claimed in the preamble of claim 1, 
integrable with semiconductor integrated 
circuits, particularly for use at high frequencies. Of all passive electrical elements (resistors, 
capacitors, and inductors), inductors are the most 
difficult to form in integrated circuits. Inductors 
present difficulties because they require relatively 
large areas and/or volumes to achieve useful values 
of inductance. In addition, the traditional three-dimension 
character of inductors is difficult to 
realize within integrated circuits that are essentially 
two-dimensional in character. The difficulties of making satisfactory 
inductors of useful values that are integrable with 
integrated circuits are aggravated at higher frequencies. 
Because of the limited volumes available 
for components, i.e., active and passive elements in 
essentially two-dimensional integrated circuits, the 
conventional inductive structures suffer from increasing 
parasitic capacitances at increasing frequencies. 
These undesirable capacitances are produced 
by conductor cross overs, closely spaced wiring 
paths, and the like. The parasitic capacitances  
 
adversely affect and limit the frequency at which 
the circuits perform properly. At high enough frequencies, 
the effects of the parasitic capacitances 
can be so strong that they overwhelm the inductive 
characteristic of an inductance element. In more 
complex structures employing 
several windings, the difficulties associated with 
controlling the area and volume of an element while 
achieving desired performance and limiting parasitic 
capacitances are even greater. It is an object of the present invention 
to provide inductive structures integrable with 
semiconductor integrated circuits that have 
reduced 
parasitic capacitances.  
 According to the invention, directed to a spiral like conductor 
supported above a substrate by a plurality 
of posts, the posts of adjacent conductors in the 
spiral are offset so that a post of one winding is 
disposed intermediate two adjacent posts of an adjacent 
winding. This spacing reduces the capacitive 
coupling and the parasitic capacitance between windings 
and posts that arises in the prior art structures.

spiral inductor; Figures 2(a) and 2(b) are plan and sectional 
views, respectively, of a prior art spiral inductor; Figures 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c) are perspective, 
plan, and sectional views, respectively, of a prior
