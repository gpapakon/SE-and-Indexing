benzaldehyde oxime derivatives, their production, and 
fungicidal, herbicidal and growth regulating compositions 
containing them. U.S.P. No. 4,599,348 (JP-A 60-87269), JP-A 1-308260, 
JP-A 3-68559, JP-A 5-1046 and WO92/09581 disclose α-azolylbenzaldehyde 
oxime derivatives and their insecticidal 
and fungicidal activities. There is still a need for 
compounds having superior activity, utility, etc., as well as 
low toxicity. The main object of the present invention is to 
provide novel compounds having excellent fungicidal, 
herbicidal and growth regulating activities. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide processes for producing the above novel compounds.  Another object of the present invention is to 
provide novel fungicidal, herbicidal and growth regulating 
compositions. These objects as well as other objects and 
advantages of the present invention will become apparent to 
those skilled in the art from the following description. The present inventors have intensively studied to 
achieve the above objects. As a result, it has been found 
that novel benzaldehyde oxime derivatives having various 
groups attached to their 2-position via an oxygen atom or 
sulfur atom, specifically α-azolyl-2-substituted benzaldehyde 
oxime derivatives, have excellent herbicidal activity, growth 
regulating activity, particularly growth inhibiting activity, 
as well as excellent fungicidal activity. That is, the present invention provides a compound
