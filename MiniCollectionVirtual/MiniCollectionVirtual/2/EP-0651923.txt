<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for generating a clock signal in a multiplexing system, to which are applied several incoming signals, whereby the clock frequency of each signal may be a specific basic frequency or a multiple thereof. According to the method the clock frequency of one incoming signal is selected to be a source of a new clock frequency to be generated, and a second clock signal depending on the selected incoming signal is applied to a phase-locked loop (23) acting as a frequency multiplier, whereby the desired clock signal is generated by multiplying said second clock signal by means of the phase-locked loop by a desired multiplier. To make it possible to synchronize the output signal with signals in a wide frequency range in such a way that the accuracy of the frequency of the output signal is independent on the clock frequency of the signal with which the output signal each time is synchronized, said second clock signal is generated, in response to the selection made, by dividing (22) the clock signal corresponding to the selected incoming signal by a factor equal to the ratio of the clock frequency of the selected incoming signal to said basic frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method according to
the prior art portion of the attached claim 1 and a
device according to the prior art portion of the attached
claim 3 for generating a clock signal in a
multiplexing system.At present a clock signal of a multiplexing
system is generated typically in such a way that the
frequency of an incoming clock signal of a multiplexing
unit is multiplied by means of a phase-locked
loop by a number providing a clock frequency desired.
For instance, when multiplexing 64 kbit/s channels
into a basic 2,048 Mbit/s multiplexing system, the
frequency (64 kHz) of an incoming clock signal of the
multiplexing unit is multiplied by 32 in order to be
able to generate a clock signal at a desired frequency
for the multiplexing system, which signal is
phase-locked to the incoming clock signal.Because, however, the transmission devices
sending the signals to be multiplexed are capable of
transmitting data at very many different frequencies,
it would be desirable to provide a method by means of
which it is possible to generate a new clock signal
phase-locked to the incoming clock signal, irrespective
of the frequency of the incoming clock signal.It is also generally known to use phase-locked
loops as frequency synthetizers. A new output frequency
is provided by loading a programmable divider
in a feedback loop of the phase-locked loop with a
new division factor. Due to the new division factor,
the loop becomes unlocked and tries to lock to a new
frequency, which is determined on the basis of the
new division factor. Such PLL is known from GB-A-2 245 441. It would be conceivable to use 
such a solution known per se for achieving the above
object as well. However, a drawback of the solution
is that the accuracy of the new clock signal generated
in this way is dependent on the selected incoming
clock signal.The object of the present invention is thus to
achieve the aim described above in such a manner that
the accuracy of the new clock signal remains unchanged
irrespective of the selected incoming signal. This
is achieved by means of the method of the invention,
which is characterized in what is set forth in the
characterizing portion of the attached claim 1. The
device according to the invention is, in turn, characterized
in what is set forth in the characterizing
portion of claim 3.The idea of the invention is to use a programmable
divider at the input of a phase-locked loop (in
addition to the fact that a fixed division factor is
used at the feedback of the loop) in such a manner
that
