<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a reversible rotary compressor 
which can compress refrigerant in either of the forward and 

reverse directions, without providing a valve mechanism in a 
closed container. In a reversible rotary compressor including 

a cylinder, a rolling piston, and a slide vane,
 

two inlet/outlet ports are formed in a space between the outer 
surface of the rolling piston and the inner surface of the 

cylinder in a state that the two inlet/outlet ports are 
disposed on both sides of the slide vane. The two inlet/outlet 

ports are closed by the rolling piston when the rolling piston 
is positioned at the top dead center and fully opened when the 

rolling piston is positioned at the bottom dead center. Two 
refrigerant pipes, coupled with the inlet/outlet ports, are 

provided in the side wall of the cylinder. The two refrigerant 
pipes are closed by the rolling piston when the rolling piston 

when the rolling piston is positioned at the top dead center 
and fully opened when the rolling piston is positioned at the 

bottom dead center.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reversible rotary
compressor in which the compressor per se is rotatable in both
the forward and reverse directions, and a reversible
refrigerating cycle using such a reversible rotary compressor.The German Patent DE-A-55 62 17 discloses a reversible
rotary compressor including a cylinder, a rolling piston
disposed therein and a slide vane. The compressor comprises
an inlet and an outlet port disposed on either side of the
slide vane and communicating with the space with the outer
surface of the rolling piston and the inner surface of the
cylinder.The PCT patent application WO-A-90/06447 discloses a
cellular blower with vanes guided in radially extended
longitudinal slots in a rotor. The rotor divides a
cylindrical chamber into high and low pressure cells, each
having inlet and outlet apertures arranged on the axial
ends of the cylindrical chamber.The Japanese patent publication JP-A-63-135742 discloses an
air conditioner having a refrigeration cycle including a
four-way valve arranged to control the inlet and outlet to
a compressor. The cooling cycle comprises the compressor,
an outdoor heat exchanger, an expansion valve and two
indoor heat exchangers which constitute a closed cycle. sThe United States Patent 4,629,403 discloses a rotary
compressor for compressing a compressible gas such as a
refrigerant. A biasing force is applied to the suction side
of the sliding vane to offset lateral forces on the vane
generated by the pressure differential within the
compression chamber. The known compressor is intended for
use in appliances such as refrigerators, freezers and air
conditioners.Fig. 12 is a conventional reversible rotary compressor
disclosed in Published Unexamined Japanese Patent Application
JP-A-62-3196. In the figure, reference numeral 112
designates a rotor of a motor; 107, a rotary shaft; 118, a
valve mechanism; 114, a main bearing; 116, a cylinder;
reference character Pa indicates a first refrigerant pipe; Pb,
a second refrigerant pipe; 119a, an intake hole; and 106, a
closed container.The operation of the reversible rotary compressor thus
constructed will be described. In Fig. 12, the rotor 112 is
controlled so as to turn the rotary shaft 107 in the forward or
reverse direction. A refrigerant gas is sucked through the
first refrigerant pipe Pa, flows through the valve mechanism
118, the flange part of the main bearing 114 and the intake
hole 119a as an intake path formed in the cylinder 116, and
flows into the cylinder 116. The refrigerant is compressed

<CLAIMS>
A reversible rotary compressor comprising a cylinder
(1) enclosed by two side walls (8), a rolling piston

(2), a slide vane (3), two inlet/outlet ports (C, D)
formed in at least one side wall (8) of the cylinder

(1) and facing the outer end surface of the rolling
piston (2), said inlet/outlet ports (C, D) being

disposed on either side of the slide vane (3) and
arranged to be closed when the rolling piston (2) is

in the top dead center position and opened when the
rolling piston (2) is in the bottom dead center

position, and a pair of refrigerant pipes (6, 7), one
coupled to each of the two inlet/outlet ports (C, D),

characterized in that

the inlet/outlet ports (C, D) in the at least one side
wall (8) provide an opening to the interior of the

cylinder (1) having a crescent-like shape, each
crescent-like opening having two curved sections

joined at a point of the opening most distant from the
slide vane (3), the radius of curvature of the curved

sections being substantially the same as the radius of
curvature of the rolling piston (2).
