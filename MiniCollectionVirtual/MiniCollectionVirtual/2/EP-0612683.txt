<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a traverse device wherein the dimensions of portions up to a thread-dividing fulcrum guide and a 
godet roller, which are disposed on the upstream side of a racking fulcrum guide, are decreased to facilitate the thread setting operation, 

the dimension of a machine base is decreased as a whole to simplify the structure to thereby shorten the times for working 
and assembling, high selveges and ribbons, which occur during packaging, are decreased and a turnback position of the thread 

can be easily changed. A straight line for connecting a traverse end portion (A) in a traverse unit (6 - 1) to a traverse end portion 
(B) and an axis of a touch roller are not arranged in parallel to each other so that the traverse unit (6 - 1) disposed at least at one 

end can be displaced to the side of a traverse unit (6 - 4) disposed at the other end, and the traverse unit (6 - 1) is of such an arrangement 
that three vanes (15 - 1 to 15 - 3) are fastened to a first rotor (13) and two vanes (20 - 1 to 20 - 2) are fastened to a second 

rotor (18) in such a manner that the respective vanes are arranged at equidistant positions on the rotating planes, respective 
positions of rotary centers of the first rotor (13) and the second rotor (18) are set such that the angle of rotation of the rotor rotating 

during the time when one vane comes into contact with a thread, moves the thread along a guide (23) for tension thread guard 

and then leaves the thread, is set at 60° for the first rotor (13) and set at substantially 90° for the second rotor (18), and the ratio 
in rotation speeds of the first rotor (13) to the second rotor (18) is set at 2:3.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus, for
winding a plurality of yarns, having a traverse-motion
mechanism in which a plurality of traversing units are
provided each reciprocating a yarn by means of a plurality of
blades secured to a pair of rotors.Generally speaking, for taking up yarns extruded from
a spinning machine a yarn winder is used. The yarn winder
comprises a spindle rotatably carried on a machine frame for
carrying bobbins and a traverse-motion mechanism mounted on
the machine frame above the spindle while being movable upward
and downward or a turret type yarn winder in which a plurality
of spindles for carrying bobbins are rotatably carried on a
turret member which, in turn, is rotatably mounted on a
machine frame.A traverse-motion mechanism used for a high-speed
winder comprises a plurality of traversing units, each
consisting of a pair of rotors carried on a frame at a
distance from each other, a plurality of blades secured onto
the respective rotor, and a yarn guide fixed to the frame so
as to be located in the path of a yarn-guiding edge of the
blade. DE-A-4142886 discloses a traversing unit of this form.
The traversing units are arranged at a predetermined pitch in
the lengthwise direction of the bobbin-carrying spindle, while
a touch roller is rotatably carried on the frame close to the
blade of the respective traverse unit at a position downstream
thereof.The blades are positioned around the rotor at an
angular pitch of 180° and 120° when the number of blades is
two and three, respectively. A pair of rotors, each provided
with the same number of blades, are secured on the frame at a
distance therebetween and rotatable in the reverse direction
to each other. A traverse-motion mechanism having a plurality of
such traversing units is disclosed, for example, in
Japanese Examined Patent Publication Nos. 3-72544
(corresponding to the U.S. Patent No. 4505436) and
4-27151 (corresponding to the U.S. Patent No. 4505437).Recently, spindles tend to be lengthened to increase
the number of bobbins (four through eight) to be carried
thereon for the purpose of increasing yarn-winding
capacity.The lengthening of spindle, however, causes the
increase of a yarn bending angle at a yarn-separating
fulcrum directly beneath a godet roller on the upstream
side toward a yarn-traversing fulcrum positioned at the
respective end of the spindle, which, in turn, results in
the deterioration of yarn quality due to the increase of
running resistance at the fulcrum. In addition, since
the yarn is taken up
