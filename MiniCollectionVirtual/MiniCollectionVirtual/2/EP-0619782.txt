<ABSTRACT>
A printer (1) for application of droplets (3) of hot melt ink (2) on a substrate (4) in order to generate characters or symbols thereon comprises a compact and space-saving housing (5) containing a reservoir (12) for supply of the hot melt ink in solid state (14), a feeder (23) for reception of the hot melt ink in solid state from the reservoir, and a print-head (40) having one or several discharge nozzles (43). Between the feeder (23) and the print-head (40) a chamber (44) is provided in the housing and the feeder is adapted to feed the hot melt ink by means of positive displacement to the chamber while the latter is being melted by a heater (33) arranged in the housing (5). The print-head receives the hot melt ink (2) in melted state (39) from the chamber and discharges it in the form of droplets (3) from the discharge nozzles (43) for application on the substrate (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention concerns a printer designed to apply 
droplets of hot melt ink onto a substrate in order to generate 
characters or symbols thereon, comprising a housing, in which are 
provided a reservoir having an inlet for supply of the hot melt ink in 
solid state and an outlet, a feeder adjacent the reservoir outlet, said 
feeder having an inlet for reception of the hot melt ink in solid state 
from the reservoir and an outlet, a heater, and a print-head formed 
with an inlet which is connected to the feeder outlet and with at least 
one discharge nozzle, said feeder supplying the hot melt ink to the 
print-head while the ink is being melted with the aid of the heater, 
said print-head receiving said molten hot melt ink from the feeder and 
discharging it in the form of droplets from the discharge nozzle for 
application of said droplets on the substrate. One prior-art device incorporating a printer for the purposes 
mentioned is known from US-A-4 870 430. The purpose of the subject invention is to avoid the disadvantages 
and the problems inherent in the prior-art device and to 
provide a printer which is complete in itself while at the same time it 
is compact and efficient. The purpose is achieved in a manner which is as simple as it is 
ingenious in that the hot melt ink in solid state is arranged to be 
supplied to the recervoir in the form of granules together with a 
carrier gas, and in that said reservoir is provided with perforations to 
allow escape of said carrier gas supplied thereto. The invention will be described in closer detail in the following 
with reference to the accompanying drawing, which in a longitudinal 
sectional view schematically illustrates a presently particularly 
preferred embodiment of the printer, a rear end of which, appearing to 
the right-hand side of the drawing, being cut away. The printer designed generally on the drawing figure by 
reference numeral 1, is designed for application of molten hot melt ink 
2 in the form of droplets 3 onto a substrate 4, such as e.g. paper,  
 
cardboard or the like which may be used to form packages of various 
kinds, primarily for foodstuff, in order to generate symbols or 
characters on said substrate 4. When the droplets 3 hit the substrate 
4 they solidify as they are cooled on impact. When the substrate 4 has an external protective plastic film, 
which often is the case in connection with foodstuff packages, the 
droplets are etched to the film as the latter softens or melts when hit 
by the droplets. The characters

A printer designed to apply droplets (3) of hot melt ink (2) 
onto a substrate (4) in order to generate characters or symbols 

thereon, comprising a housing (5), in which are provided a reservoir 
(12) having an inlet (13) for supply of the hot melt ink (2) in solid state 

(14) and an outlet (18), a feeder (23) adjacent the reservoir outlet, said 
feeder having an inlet (24) for reception of the hot melt ink (2) in solid 

state (14) from the reservoir and an outlet (25), a heater (33), and a 
print-head (40) formed with an inlet (41) which is connected to the 

feeder outlet and with at least one discharge nozzle (43), said feeder 
supplying the hot melt ink to the print-head while the ink is being 

melted with the aid of the heater, said print-head receiving said 
molten hot melt ink from the feeder and discharging it in the form of 

droplets (3) from the discharge nozzle for application of said droplets 
on the substrate (4), 
characterized
 in that the hot melt ink 
(2) in solid state (14) is arranged to be supplied to the reservoir (12) in 

the form of granules together with a carrier gas (19), and in that said 
reservoir (12) is provided with perforations (21) to allow escape of said 

carrier gas supplied thereto. 
A printer as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that a heat-insulating means (35) is arranged inside the housing (5) 

between the reservoir (12) and the heater (33) in order to insulate the 
reservoir from the heat from the heater. 
A printer as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the perforations in the reservoir (12) are formed by a net (21) 

forming the jacket (20) of the reservoir, and in that the granules have 
an average diameter size ranging from about 0.3 to 0.5 mm, the mesh 

size of said net being smaller than said average diameter. 
A printer as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 in that the feeder (23) is configured as a screw 
worm (26) which is driven by a motor (29) and which is rotatably 

mounted inside a housing (27), said housing being formed with at 
least one aperture (32), said aperture positioned in the reservoir (12) 

and forming the feeder inlet opening (24) to allow said screw worm to 
receive hot melt ink (2) in solid state (14) from the reservoir and to  

 
transport said ink along the reservoir in the direction towards the 

feeder outlet (25). 
A printer as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 

characterized
 in that the heater (33) is a heating block (34) 
enclosing and heating the feeder (23) downstream of the heat 

insulating means (35) and melting the hot melt ink (2) therein before 
the ink reaches the feeder outlet (25). 
A printer as claimed in claim 5,

block (34) to heat the latter. 
A printer as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 

characterized

actuating part (46), said parts being separated from one another by a 
diaphragm (47), and in that the inlet and the outlet (48 and 49, 

respectively) of the chamber respectively debouches into and departs 
from the pressure part, and in that the actuating part houses an 

actuating means (50) adapted to adjustably actuate the diaphragm 
and consequently to effect variable pressurization of the hot melt ink
