<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
the use of substituted
adenine derivatives for the manufacture of a medicament for treating multiple sclerosis.Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the result of
demyelination in the brain and spinal cord (central
nervous system). Symptoms resulting from this
demyelination include weakness, visual impairment,
incoordination, and paresthesia (abnormal tingling).
The course of the disease is largely unpredictable,
but often progresses through a cycle of exacerbation
of symptoms followed by remission.Conventional treatments presently employ therapy
with ACTH or corticosteroids such as prednisone.
Controlled studies suggest that such treatments
induce more rapid clearing of acute symptoms and
signs but leave the long-term outcome of the disease
unaffected. Long-term maintenance therapy with ACTH
or corticosteroids is contraindicated. Evidence
indicates that immunosuppressant agents have no long-term
benefit. (Cecil, Textbook of Medicine, Beeson et
al., eds., 15th ed., W.B. Saunders Company,
Philadelphia, (1979) page 847)The etiology of multiple sclerosis is unknown
but is linked to a variety of genetic and
environmental factors. Both cell-mediated and
humoral immune responses, triggered by extraneous or
autoantigens may contribute to the pathogenesis of
multiple sclerosis. Certain immune response genes
may be associated with an increased susceptibility to 
the disease. The disease may be mediated by T cells
that recognize an as yet unidentified autoantigen.
For example, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis
(EAE), an animal model of demyelinating diseases such
as multiple sclerosis, can be induced by immunizing
mice with whole myelin or specific myelin components
such as myelin basic protein.In humans with multiple sclerosis, exacerbations
are correlated with high levels of neopterin in blood
and cerebrospinal fluid. Neopterin is a factor
released from monocytes and macrophages in the presence of activated
T-cells,
thereby implicating these cells as being involved in
multiple sclerosis exacerbations. (Fredrickson et
al. (1987), Acta Neurol. Scand., 75:352-355; Huber et
al. (1984), J. Exp. Med., 160:310-316). At the
microscopic level, monocytes, microglial cells
(macrophages of the central nervous system)
and activated T-cells are found
within the demyelinated regions of the nerve cells
during multiple sclerosis exacerbations. (Cecil,
Textbook of Medicine (1979), Beeson et al. (eds.),
W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA).Various conventional treatment methodologies
have been employed to

Use of a substituted adenine derivative having a structure represented by the
formula:



or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof

where:

Z is O
-
 or absent;
Y is hydrogen or a substituent containing one to about 20 atoms that is free from
net ionic charge at physiological pH values, produces a soluble adenine derivative,

and whose presence on the adenine moiety inhibits deamination of said adenine
derivative by adenosine deaminase; and
X is hydrogen or fluoro,
with the proviso that when Z is absent, Y is not hydrogen
for the preparation of a medicament for treating multiple sclerosis.
The use of claim 1, wherein Z is absent and Y is halo group.
The use of claim 1 wherein said substituted adenine is 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine.
The use of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the treatment is by application of the
adenine derivative to the patient's serum. 
The use of any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the medicament is in the form of a
subcutaneous injectable medium.
The use of any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the medicament is in the form of an
intravenous infusion.
The use of any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the medicament is in the form of
capsules, powders or granules, in the form of tablets or pills that are optionally provided

with an enteric layer, in the form of a suppository, in the form of a solution, suspension
or elixir or in the form of liposomes.
