<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photoelectric 
conversion semiconductor device and a method of manufacturing 
such a device, and the photoelectric conversion semiconductor is 
directed to a device used for measurement of only a light having 
a wavelength of 100 to 1200 nm, but also X-rays, a radiation and 
a charged particle. In general, such a photoelectric conversion semiconductor 
device is directed to all the semiconductor devices which are 
variously named such as a photodiode, a pin diode, an avalanche 
photodiode, a photodiode array, a photosensor, a microstrip 
sensor, a double-sided microstrip sensor, a radiation sensor, a 
semiconductor photosensor, a semiconductor image sensor device, 
a semiconductor image pickup device, and the like. The present invention relates to a structure which 
realizes an improvement in performance of these semiconductor 
devices, and a manufacturing method for achieving such an 
improvement. Conventionally, at first, there has been known a 
semiconductor device of such a field, as shown in Fig. 24 as a 
schematic sectional view, in which an n⁻ type semiconductor 
substrate 1 which is a first conductivity type semiconductor 
substrate is provided with a p⁺ type conductivity impurity 
region 2 which is a second conductivity type semiconductor 
impurity region. As shown, if a side (surface) where the p⁺ type 
impurity region 2 exists is named a front surface of the 
semiconductor device, then an n⁺ impurity region 3 whose 
density is higher than the substrate exists in a rear surface 
of the semiconductor device so as to form a p-n junction of p⁺-n⁻n⁺. 
This type of the semiconductor device is called a pin 
diode. A semiconductor device in which the impurity density of 
the n⁻ type semiconductor substrate 1 has the degree of 1 x 10¹² 
atoms/cm³ to 1 x 10¹³ atoms/cm³ (hereinafter omitting "atoms/cm³" 
when referring to the density, and indicating 1 x 10¹² as 1E12) 
is named "pin" by taking an initial "i" from an intrinsic 
semiconductor. Each of n⁻, n⁺, p⁺ and the like means that the mark "-" 
has the impurity density lower than that of n or p, and the 
mark "+" has the impurity density higher than that of n or p in  
 
the respective conductivity type impurity. The p⁺ type impurity region has the impurity density of 
1E19 to 7E19 and the depth Xj of a diffused layer (a so-called 
distance to the p-n junction portion in a longitudinal 
direction) of 0.5 to 2.0 µm. The n⁺ type impurity region also 
has the impurity density of 1E19 to 1E21 and the depth Xj of a 
diffus
