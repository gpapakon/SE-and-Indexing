<ABSTRACT>
A video system comprises a main body having a signal 
processing section, a signal recording/reproducing section and 

a coupling device, and a plurality of independent modules 
which are separably engaged with the main body through the use 

of the coupling device, said modules including a camera module 
for providing a camera video signal to the signal processing 

section, a tuner module for providing a broadcast signal to 
the signal processing section, a computer interface module for 

providing a digital data signal to the signal processing 
section and a display module for displaying the output signal 

provided from the signal processing section, wherein the 
signal processing section includes a system controller, a 

coupling sensing device connected to the system controller for 
detecting the connection status of each of the modules to the 

main body and a digital signal processor connected to the 
system controller for processing an input signal provided to 

the signal processing section in a digital format.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video system; and,
more particularly, to a video system having a plurality of
separable modules.Video systems may be grouped into home use equipment and
portables. The home use equipment may be employed to record
and/or reproduce a television program received through its
built-in type tuner, while the portable system is intended to
record, e. g., an image photographed by its built-in camera.
A battery is normally furnished to power the portable
apparatus.U. S. Patent No. US-A-4,899,231 issued to Masaya Maeda et al.
discloses a portable video system, having a reduced size and
weight, comprising a recording device such as a video tape
recorder, a video camera as a signal source and a reproduction
unit, which are separable each other as independent modules.
The recording device is combined with the video camera for the
purpose of recording an image obtained through the video
camera and combined with the reproduction unit for the
reproduction of the recorded image. The portable video system, however, has a complicated
construction since the recording device and the reproducing
unit have their corresponding signal processing units.
Further, the recording device should always be carried by an
user even if no recording function achieved by the recording
device is necessary because a source signal generated from the
video camera passes through the recording device.It is, therefore, a primary object of the invention to
provide a video system having a plurality of separable modules
and a signal processing module which is designed to centrally
process signals from and to the separable modules.In accordance with the present invention, there is
provided a video system which comprises a main body having a
signal processing section, a signal recording/reproducing
section and a coupling device, and a plurality of independent
modules which can all at the same time be separably engaged with the main body through
the use of the coupling device, said modules including a
camera module for providing a camera video signal to the
signal processing section, a tuner module for providing a
broadcast signal to the signal processing section, a computer
interface module for providing a digital data signal to the
signal processing section and a display module for displaying
the output signal provided from the signal processing section, 
wherein the signal processing section includes a system
controller, a coupling sensing device connected to the system
controller for detecting the connection status

<CLAIMS>
A video system comprising:

a main body having a signal processing section, a
recording/reproducing section and a coupling means; and
a plurality of independent modules said plurality comprising a camera
module, a display module, a tuner module, and an external

digital signal processing system interface module which can all at the same time be
separably engaged with the main body through the coupling

means, the camera module providing a camera video signal to
the signal processing section, the tuner module providing a

broadcast video signal to the signal processing section, the
interface module providing a digital data signal to the signal

processing section and the display module displaying an output
video signal provided from the signal processing section,

   wherein the signal processing section includes:

a system controller for controlling the video system;
a coupling sensing means connected to the system
controller for detecting the connection status of each of the

modules to the main body through the coupling means; and
a signal processing means connected to the system
controller for processing an input signal provided to the

signal processing section in a digital form to produce the
output signal.
The video system of claim 1, wherein the
recording/reproducing section includes:


an encoder for encoding the output signal provided from
the signal processing means to produce an encoded signal for

the recording thereof;
a recording/reproducing means for recording the encoded
signal from the encoder on a recording medium and reproducing

a prerecorded signal on the recording medium;
a detector for performing an integration process for the
reproduced prerecorded signal to produce a digitized signal;

and
a decoder for decoding the digitized signal from the
detector to produce and send a decoded signal which constitutes

the input signal to the signal processing means.
