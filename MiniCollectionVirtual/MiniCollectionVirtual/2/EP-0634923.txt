at least one isatin derivative corresponding to formula I: 


 
in which R¹ is hydrogen, a C₁₋₄ alkyl group, a C₂₋₄ hydroxyalkyl 

group, a C₂₋₂₀ acyl group, a phenyl group or a benzoyl 
group and R², R³, R⁴ and R⁵ independently of one another 

represent hydrogen, hydroxy, halogen, nitro groups C₁₋₄ alkyl 
groups, C₁₋₄ alkoxy groups or R⁶R⁷N groups where R⁶ and R⁷ 

independently of one another represent hydrogen, C₁₋₄ alkyl 
groups or C₂₋₄ hydroxyalkyl groups and two adjacent groups 

R², R³, R⁴ and R⁵ may also represent a C₁₋₄ alkylenedioxy 
group,
 
and at least one amino acid or a water-soluble oligopeptide 

synthesized from 2 to 9 amino acids in a water-containing 
carrier. 
Formulations for colouring keratin fibres as claimed 
in claim 1, characterized in that, in the isatin derivative 

corresponding to formula I, R¹ is hydrogen and R², R³, R⁴ and 
R⁵ independently of one another represent hydrogen, hydroxy, 

halogen, nitro groups or R⁶R⁷N groups where R⁶ and R⁷ represent 
hydrogen. 
Formulations for colouring keratin-containing fibres 
as claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the 

compound corresponding to formula I is isatin.

titanium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, silver, 
zinc, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium and 

gadolinium salts. 
Formulations for colouring keratin-containing fibres 
as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that the salts are 

halides, nitrates, nitrites, acetates, lactates, glycolates, 
tartrates, citrates, gluconates, propionates, 

sulfates, carbonates, succinates, phosphates, phosphonates 
or sulfonates.

consisting of ammonium carbonate, chloride and acetate, 
lithium bromide, magnesium chloride and sulfate, calcium 

chloride and gluconate, strontium chloride and nitrate, 
aluminium chloride and lactate, zinc chloride and sulfate, 

copper(II) chloride and sulfate and lanthanum nitrate. 
Hair colouring formulations containing at least one 
isatin corresponding to formula I in a quantity of 0.3 to 

65 and preferably 6 to 20 mmoles, at least one amino acid 
or a water-soluble oligopeptide synthesized from 2 to 9 

amino acids in a quantity of 0.3 to 65 and preferably 6 to 
20 mmoles, based in both cases on 100 g of the colouring 

formulation as a whole, and a water-containing carrier. 
Hair colouring formulations as claimed in claim 8, 
characterized in that at least one salt selected from the 

group of ammonium, lithium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, 
barium, aluminium, titanium, manganese, iron, cobalt, 

nickel, copper, silver, zinc, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium,  
 

neodymium and gadolinium salts is additionally present 
in a quantity of 0.3 to 65 and preferably 2 to 15 mmoles, 

based on 100 g of the colouring formulation as a whole.
