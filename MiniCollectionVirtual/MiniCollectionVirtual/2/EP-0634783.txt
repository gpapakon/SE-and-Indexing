<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and a method for baking and cooling 
silicon substrates are disclosed. Both baking and cooling 

of silicon substrates are done in a single integrated 
thermal process module. Each thermal process module 

includes two hot plate assemblies, a cool plate assembly, 
two local linear transfer arms and a micro-processor based 

module controller. Both transfer arms are capable of 
transferring substrates among the cool and hot plate 

assemblies. The module controller ensures that there are 
no conflicts in use of the transfer arms or in use of the 

hot and cool plate assemblies and so that a transfer arm 
is always available when a substrate is finished baking. 

A central substrate handling robot transports substrates 
only from and to the cool plate assembly of the thermal 

process module. Also, the vacuum tubing is routed via a 
unique pulley arrangement to achieve compact mounting and 

eliminate loose tubing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to substrate photolithography 
systems and, in particular, a system for heating and 
cooling semiconductor substrates in the course of forming 
a photoresist mask on the surface of the substrate. The process by which a photoresist mask is formed on 
a semiconductor substrate involves first coating the 
substrate with a thin layer of photoresist, exposing the 
resist with the desired pattern, and then developing the 
photoresist layer. In performing this process, silicon substrates are 
placed on hot plates where they are baked at precise 
temperatures for precise periods of time. In a typical 
process, a clean substrate is initially subjected to a 
dehydration bake at 100-150°C to remove moisture. Then, 
after a thin layer of photoresist is applied to the 
substrate, the substrate is subjected to a "soft" bake at 
90-120oC. Again, after the photoresist has been exposed, 
the substrate is subjected to a post-exposure bake at 60-120°C. 
Also, following a developing step, the substrate 
is subjected to a "hard" bake at 130-160oC to dry the 
substrate. After each of the foregoing heating steps, the 
substrate must be cooled to room temperature in order to 
assure a uniform process. Precise baking and cooling of 
silicon substrates is one of the most important processes 
used in the fabrication of very large scale integrated 
(VLSI) circuits. All of these baking and cooling steps must be 
performed in a clean room which is temperature and  
 
humidity controlled and substantially free of dust and 
other particulate matter. In the prior art, the most 
common system for performing this process consists of a 
track arrangement in which the substrate is transported to 
successive stages in a sequence. This type of arrangement 
has a limited flexibility, since the substrates are locked 
in a fixed order. In a less common type of arrangement, various hot 
plates and cool plates are positioned on two sides of a 
long central track and the substrates are transported 
between plates by a single robot which moves back and 
forth along the central track. Such prior art 
arrangements are extremely wasteful of floor area since no 
processing occurs in the track area. In addition, in these prior art systems, if a single 
robot arm handles all the substrates, only one substrate 
may be serviced at any one time. Thus if two substrates 
are finished baking at the same time, only one of the 
substrates can be removed from the hot plate. The other 
substrate may be overbaked. Also, in prior art systems,
