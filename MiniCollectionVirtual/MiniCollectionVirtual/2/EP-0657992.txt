<ABSTRACT>
An alternating current generator for motor vehicles 
having an extremely small power loss and which can be simply 

cooled includes a power converter having at least either high 
side semiconductor power elements or low side semiconductor 

elements. The high side power elements connect an output 
terminal of the armature coil to a high potential terminal of 

the battery; the low side semiconductor power elements 
connect an output terminal of the armature coil to a low 

potential terminal of the battery. The power converter 
converts the alternating current generated voltage of the 

armature coil into a direct current voltage to supply 
electricity to the battery. An exciting current controller 

includes a switching transistor for controlling an exciting 
current to a field coil. Either or both all the 

semiconductor power elements in the power converter or the 
switching transistor in the exciting current controller is 

formed of SiC material, which is a compound of Si and C, 
having a resistivity smaller than that of pure Si.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an alternating
current (A. C.) generator for motor vehicles according to the preamble of claim 1, the generator
having a power converter for converting an alternating
current generated voltage into a direct current voltage and
an exciting current controller for controlling an exciting
coil. More particularly, the A. C. generator for motor
vehicles according to the present invention can be applied
to so-called alternators driven by an engine, alternators
for regenerating kinetic energy generated at the time of
braking vehicles as an electric power to enable the
generation of power, and for vehicle-driving motors for electric
automobiles.There are already known A. C. generators which include
a three-phase full wave rectifier having high side
semiconductor elements for individually connecting each end 
of a three-phase armature winding (coil) to a high potential
end of a battery and a low potential end thereof, and a low
side three-phase full wave rectifier having semiconductor
power elements, and a controller for synchronously
interrupting each of the aforementioned semiconductor power
elements. The three-phase full wave rectifier converts a
voltage generated by the three-phase armature winding into
a direct current in order to supply electricity to the battery. For
example, JP-A-4-138030 discloses a generator according to the preamble of claim 1
in which MOS power transistors are used
as semiconductor power elements.MOS power transistors of this kind normally adopt
a vertical-type transistor structure in which an N-type
silicon (Si) substrate constitutes a main electrode on one
side of the MOS transistor to secure a withstand voltage and
a reduction in resistance; an N+-type region constitutes the
other main electrode thereof, the N+-type region being formed
on a surface portion of a P-type well region formed on the
surface of a chip.On the other hand, an output current of such an A. C.
generator for motor vehicles is controlled by connecting in
series an exciting coil and a switching transistor between
both output terminal of the three-phase full wave rectifier
and interrupting an exciting current passing through the
exciting coil with a switching transistor of an exciting
current controller. This exciting current controller is
normally arranged either inside or outside of a housing of 
the A. C. generator for the shrinkage of wirings and a
reduction in the generation of the electromagnetic noises.As the switching transistor, transistors formed of
silicon, either bipolar
