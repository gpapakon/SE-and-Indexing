<ABSTRACT>
A processing system is disclosed which 
includes first and second chambers, each for 

accommodating a processing apparatus therein, each 
chamber being able to be kept gas tight, a coupling 

member for coupling the processing apparatuses 
accommodated in the first and second chambers with 

each other, and an elastic gas tightness holding 
member for gas tightly sealing portions between the 

coupling member and the first and second chambers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a processing 
system, such as an exposure system or a thin film 
forming system, for example, for performing a certain 
process in a reduced pressure ambience. X-ray exposure apparatuses using SR 
(synchrotron radiation) light are known. The SR light 
is attenuated largely in an air and, to avoid this, a 
synchrotron ring and a beam port for emitting SR light 
are kept under vacuum. The SR light is directed 
through a blocking window (beryllium window) into an 
exposure apparatus in which a mask and a wafer are 
placed. Also, the mask and the wafer are desirably 
disposed in an exposure ambience of vacuum or reduced 
pressure helium and, thus, the exposure apparatus is 
desirably accommodated in a reduced pressure 
container. Figure 12 is a schematic view of a known type 
processing system. Denoted in the drawing at 1 is a 
process chamber of reduced pressure ambience in which 
a process such as an exposure process or a thin film 
forming process, for example, is performed. Denoted 
at 2 is a load-lock chamber. While not shown in the 
drawing, there are a pump and valves for gas supplying  
 
and discharging of these two chambers. Disposed 
between the two chambers are a gate valve 9 and a 
bellows 11. Closing the gate valve 9 is effective to 
maintain the pressures of the two chambers, 
respectively. The process chamber 1 is supported through 
supporting members 8a and 8b by first base table 3, 
while the load lock chamber 2 is supported thereby 
through supporting members 8c and 8d. The first base 
table 3 is provided with air mounts (air springs) 16 
by which vibration from the floor can be intercepted. 
Within the process chamber 1, a second base table 4 is 
supported by supporting members 8e and 8f. Processing 
stage 12 and a conveying robot 13 are mounted on the 
second base table 4. Within the load lock chamber 2, 
a third base table 5 is supported by supporting 
members 8g and 8h. Sample holding table 14 for 
holding a sample such as a substrate, for example, is 
mounted on the third base table 5. Figure 13 is a schematic view of another 
processing system of known type. SR light is 
projected through a beam port having its inside 
maintained under ultra high vacuum and through a 
beryllium window 52, into a stage accommodating 
chamber 60 of reduced pressure helium ambience. 
Disposed within the stage accommodating chamber 60 is 
a base table 58 which supports a mask chuck 53 for  
 
holding a mask 54 through attraction as well as a 
stage 57 for positioning a wafer
