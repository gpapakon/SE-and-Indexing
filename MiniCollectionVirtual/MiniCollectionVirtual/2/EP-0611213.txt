<ABSTRACT>
A transparent substrate (1), especially of glass, provided with a stack of thin layers comprising at least one metallic layer (5) with properties in the infrared, especially of low emission, arranged between two coatings based on dielectric material. The coating underlying the layer (5) with properties in the infrared comprises at least one wetting coating which is adjacent to the said layer (5) and which includes a layer (3) either based on tantalum oxide or based on niobium oxide.

Transparent and in particular glass substrate (1), provided with a stack 
of thin coatings having at least one metal coating (5) with properties in the 

infrared and in particular of a low emissive nature, placed between two layers 
based on dielectric material, characterized in that the layer below the coating 

(5) having properties in the infrared has at least one wetting layer adjacent 
to said coating (5) and comprising a coating (3) either based on tantalum 

oxide, or based on niobium oxide, and, beneath said wetting layer, at least one 
thin coating (2) based on metal oxide or nitride other than tantalum oxide or 

niobium oxide. 
Substrate according to claim 1, characterized in that the wetting layer 
comprises a coating (3) based on tantalum oxide or niobium oxide surmounted by 

a metal alloy or metal-based coating (4) with a thickness between 0.3 and 1 
nanometre. 
Substrate according to claim 2, characterized in that the coating (5) 
having properties in the infrared is based on silver. 
Substrate according to either of the claims 2 and 3, characterized in that 
the metal or metal alloy-based coating (4) of the wetting layer is of tin or 

nickel-chromium alloy. 
Substrate according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the layer below the metal coating (5) having properties in the infrared 

has, beneath the wetting layer, at least one thin, metal oxide-based coating 
(2) and in particular a coating based on tin oxide or titanium oxide or based 

on nitride, such as silicon nitride. 
Substrate according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the coating (5) having properties in the infrared is covered with a metal 

alloy or metal-based sacrificial coating (6) such as of a nickel-chromium 
alloy, particularly having a thickness between 0.3 and 8 nanometres. 
Substrate according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the dielectric material-based layer above the metal coating (5) having 

properties in the infrared has at least one thin, metal oxide coating,  
 

particularly a coating (7) based on tin oxide and/or a coating (8) based on 
tantalum oxide and/or a silicon nitride coating. 
Substrate according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the coating (5) having properties in the infrared has a thickness between 

7 and 12 nanometres. 
Substrate according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the layer below the coating (5) having properties in the infrared has a 

total thickness between 30 and 60 nanometres. 
Substrate according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the tantalum or niobium oxide-based coating (3) belonging to the wetting 

layer has a thickness between 5 and 30 nanometres, preferably between 5 and 20 
nanometres and particularly approximately 10 nanometres. 
Substrate according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the dielectric material layer (6, 7) above the metal coating (5) having 

properties in the infrared has a total thickness between 30 and 60 nanometres. 
Substrate according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that it is provided with a stack of thin coatings including two metal coatings 

(5) having properties in the infrared. 
Application of the substrate according to any one of the preceding claims,

or below 0.08 and having a high light transmission T
L
