<ABSTRACT>
In order to connect simply, rapidly and preferably fully automatically a small electric motor, in particular an electric motor for the central locking system of a motor vehicle, to the ends (33, 34) of conductor tracks and thus be able to accommodate the electric motor compactly in the housing (1) of the central locking system, the invention proposes that the electric motor (2) be connected to a plug-in adapter (5). This unit is subsequently pressed against the ends (33, 34) of the parallel conductor tracks. This eliminates welding work and troublesome cables.

<CLAIMS>
Device for connecting a miniature electric motor (2) with at 
least two electric conductor tracks (6, 7) of a printed-circuit 

board (8), especially with regard to a housing (1) 
of a central locking device of an automotive vehicle, the 

miniature motor (2) being provided with one socket per end 
piece of the conductor track (33, 34) to be inserted, and 

the end pieces of the conductor tracks projecting 
substantially vertically from the plane of the printed-circuit 

board; the device comprising an adapter (5) between 
the miniature motor (2) and the printed-circuit board (8), 

the adapter including a base member (15) and at least two 
electrically conductive elements (13, 14), one end piece of 

each conductor track (33, 34) being adapted to be connected 
in an electrically conductive way with a socket of the 

miniature motor (2) by way of an electrically conductive 
element (13, 14); the ends of the electrically conductive 

elements (13, 14) close to the motor form flat plug pins 
which are adapted to be mounted in the sockets of the 

miniature motor in a jammed manner; the base member has 
insertion slots (37, 38) which extend in the plug-in 

direction of the conductor track end pieces (33, 34), and 
the ends of the electrically conductive elements (13, 14) 

remote from the motor crossing the insertion slots so that 
the conductor track end pieces (33, 34) are adapted to be 

connected to the electrically conductive elements (13, 14) 
in a pluggable manner.  

 
Device as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the ends (21, 22) of the 
electrically conductive elements (13, 14) close to the motor 

project from a surface (32) of the adapter (5) facing the 
motor (2) or adjacent to it approximately to the same 

extent, being parallel to each other and perpendicular to 
the above mentioned surface (32). 
Device as claimed in claim 2,
characterized
 in that the flat sides of the 
electrically conductive elements (13, 14) are parallel to 

each other, each one presenting a depression (18, 19) 
extending in the plug-in direction (18). 
Device as claimed in claim 3,
characterized
 in that the depressions (19, 20) 
of the two electrically conductive elements (13, 14) point 

towards each other or away from each other. 
Device as claimed in at least one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the adapter (5) and the 
motor (2), particularly in the area of the electric plug-in 

connection (21, 22), are connected positively. 
Device as claimed in claim 5,
characterized
 in that the adapter (5) has an 
essentially angular design, the two angle legs (11, 12) 

which protrude in the slip-on direction (18) encompassing 
the housing of the motor (2) on the outside.  

 
Device as claimed in at least one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the electrically 
conductive elements (13, 14) have an essentially angular 

shape, and in that the electrically conductive elements (13, 
14) are inserted into the base member (15) of adapter (5) in 

the longitudinal direction of the angle leg (23, 24) which 
is remote from the motor. 
Device as claimed in claim 7,
characterized
 in that the angle leg (23, 24) of 
each electrically conductive element (13, 14) which is 

remote from the motor, has a fork-like shape, and in that 
the free ends of the two fork prongs are bent off towards 

each other or deflected in order to form a throat (31). 
Device as claimed in claim 8,
characterized
 in that at the insertion end of 
each end piece of the conductor track (33, 34) there is an 

enlargement, especially a depression extending in the 
insertion direction, which is associated with the space (27) 

between the parallel parts of the fork prongs (29, 30). 
Device as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the slots (37, 38) at 
their end for the insertion of the end pieces of the 

conductor tracks (33, 34) are expanded in order to form 
insertion slopes (40, 41).
