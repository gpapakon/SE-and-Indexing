<ABSTRACT>
A lithographic printing plate is prepared from a silver 
halide photosensitive material in accordance with a DTR 

process. The photosensitive material is exposed and developed 
with a diffusion transfer processing solution containing a 

compound of the formula: RSO₂SM wherein R is an aliphatic, 
aromatic or heterocyclic group and M is a hydrogen atom or 

cation as a silver halide complexing agent. The printing plate 
has good ink receptivity and minimized plate wear. The 

processing solution is free from the problems of corrosion and 
waste solution disposal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for preparing a 
lithographic or planographic printing plate in accordance with 
a silver complex diffusion transfer process, and a processing 
solution used therefor. Printing plates designed such that a silver image obtained 
by the silver complex diffusion transfer reversal (DTR) process 
is used as an offset printing master are known in the art as 
disclosed in Land et al., USP 3,220,837, De Haes et al., USP 
3,721,559, Japanese Patent Publication (JP-B) Nos. 43132/1971, 
16725/1973, and 30562/1973, and Japanese Patent Application 
Kokai (JP-A) No. 004482/1971 and 021603/1978. Among them, some 
printing plates are used in practice. In general, a lithographic printing plate has a printing 
surface including a lipophilic image area capable of receiving 
greasy ink and a hydrophilic non-image area repellent to ink 
and is a hydrophilic area receptive to water. Lithographic 
printing is usually carried out by supplying water and ink 
simultaneously to the plate surface so that the image area 
receives coloring ink and the non-image area receives water 
both preferentially whereupon the ink on the image area  
 
is transferred to an ink-receptive sheet, typically paper. 
Printed matter is obtained in this way. The key to 
satisfactory printed matter is a definite difference between 
cage and non-image areas, that is, a definite difference 
between lipophilic and hydrophilic properties. It is necessary 
that when water and ink are supplied to the plate surface, the 
image area receive a sufficient amount of ink and the non-image 
or background area do not receive ink at all. One of the drawbacks of lithographic printing plates 
prepared by the silver complex diffusion transfer reversal 
(DTR) process is that they are less resistant to mechanical 
wear so that hydrophobic areas carrying ink images gradually 
lose ink receptivity. That is, printing endurance (also known 
as plate wear or run length) is reduced. In turn, hydrophilic 
areas gradually become hydrophobic, that is, non-image areas or 
background areas are contaminated with ink. Further, 
hydrophobic image areas become defective in uniform greasy ink 
receptivity. A variation in ink receptivity occurs among the 
image areas, meaning that the areas to be printed do not 
receive a uniform quantity of ink. Important factors dictating that silver grains transfer-developed 
by the DTR process endure more printing operation are 
the conditions under which transferred silver grains are 
generated, for example, the
