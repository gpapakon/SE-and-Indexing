<ABSTRACT>
A curler formed by a shaped body including two concave annular surfaces (1, 2) which perpendicularly intersect at two points (3, 3') belonging to a symmetry axis (A3) of the body, said body being also provided with internal communicating ducts (5, 5', 6, 6', 7) accessible from outside.

<DESCRIPTION>
 "CURLER FOR DIFFERENTIATED HAIR WAVING"The present invention concerns curlers used for hair curling and in particular refers to a curler for differentiated hair waving.It is known that to obtain different types of hairstyles curlers are used which are formed by small cylinders of various sizes and materials, possibly flexible, around which hair locks are wound to achieve the curling thereof. The main drawback of the curlers of known type is that they can produce substantially constant waves only, since each lock is wound, for its whole length, on a constant curvature surface. Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a curler which gives a differentiated waving to a lock along the length thereof according to the way in which a coiffeur has wound the lock on the proper curler surfaces.This object is achieved by means of a curler formed by a shaped body including two concave annular surfaces which intersect in two points belonging to a same symmetry axis of the body.The curler according to the present invention is provided with some internal ducts which cross the body thereof and are immediately accessible by the coiffeur. Thanks to this feature, this curler, in addition to modelling at will a lock, has the advantage of allowing an extremely effective application of liquid or foamy products of various kinds which easily reach even the most internally wound lock coils.These and other advantages of the curler according to the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of an embodiment thereof with reference to the annexed drawings wherein:Fig.1 is a top view of a curler according to the present invention;Fig.2 is a side view of the same curler along arrow A of fig.1 ; andFig.3 is a side view of the same curler along arrow B of fig.1.Referring to fig.1 , there is seen that this curler is formed by a single body shaped so as to have two concave annular surfaces 1 , 2 which perpendicularly intersect, in particular at two points 3, 3' which result superimposed and coinciding with the central point 10 of the figure in the drawing. Each side edge of annular surface 1 is connected to the adjacent 

 side edge of annular surface 2 through a surface 4a belonging to a massive part or lobe 4 of the structure. Therefore, the structure itself includes four lobes of this kind, as shown in fig.1.The curler body is provided with through holes or ducts, both in the direction of axes A1 and A2 of annular surfaces 1 and 2, and in the oblique direction with respect to said

CLAIMS
1. A curler characterized in that it is formed by a shaped body including two concave annular surfaces (1 , 2) which intersect at two points (3, 3') belonging to a symmetry axis (A3) of the body. 2. A curler according to claim 1 , characterized in that said concave annular surfaces (1 , 2) perpendicularly intersect .
3. A curler according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that it includes four substantially massive portions or lobes (4) each of which connects a respective part of the edge of a surface (1 , 2) with the adjacent edge part of the other surface (1 , 2).
4. A curler according to claim 3, characterized in that it is provided both with internal ducts (5, 5') which diagonally cross it while having the respective pairs of mouths formed in opposite lobes (4), and with internal ducts (6, 6') which cross it along directions perpendicular to said symmetry axis (A3) having the respective pairs of mouths formed in axially opposite points on concave annular surfaces (1 , 2), and/or with an internal duct (7) having its mouths at said points (3, 3'), said ducts (5, 5') being in communication with said ducts (6, 6') and/or with said duct (7) at the curler body central point (10). 5. A curler according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that both of the concave annular surfaces (1 , 2) have a circular development.
6. A curler according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that at least one of the concave annular surfaces (1 , 2) has an elliptical development.
7. A curler according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that it is manufactured by injection molding of a plastic material.
8. A curler according to one of the preceding claims from 1 to 6, characterized in that it is made of a material having mild magnetism. 9. A curler for differentiated hair waving substantially as above described and illustrated in the annexed drawings.
