<ABSTRACT>
Granulation of an organic crystalline material, particularly 
organic acid material, in order to increase particle size 

and improve flow properties, is disclosed, by adding a fine 
powder and a liquid, such that powder and liquid together 

form an interstitial binding material, gluing the original 
crystals together, and drying the mixture to remove excess 

water, said binding material being formed from a combination 
of: 


a) an inert, water-insoluble powdered material and an 
aqueous solution of a film-forming polymeric material; 

or 
b) an inert water-soluble powdered material and water, or 
an aqueous solution of a film-forming polymeric 

material. 
The granulates are used in formulating a granular acidic 
cleaner for cleaning dishwashing machine interior packed in 

a unit-dose twin compartment container comprising a 
granulated sulphamic acid in one compartment and citric acid 

(granulated or ungranulated) in the other compartment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to granular acidic cleaners 
comprising a granulated acid material and method of 
preparing same. Organic acid materials, such as sulphamic acid, maleic acid 
and the like, are effective in removing lime-scale deposits 
from hard surfaces, such as porcelain, enamel and metal 
surfaces of e.g. bath-tubs and washing machines. These acids are normally available as fine crystalline 
material having particle size of less than 1.0 mm, e.g. from 
about 0.5-0.6 mm. They often show poor flow properties, 
probably because of moisture at the surface. Granular 
products comprising sulphamic acid recommended for use in 
the cleaning of interiors of dishwashing machines are known 
from EP-A-0,256,148. Commercial products of this type are 
rather sticky, having an unsightly appearance unappealing to 
customers and have to be packed in plastic bags. Another 
drawback is that solid granular products comprising these 
acids are difficult to perfume. Being a crystalline material 
it is non-absorbing; the acid also tends to cause 
deterioration of the perfume resulting in off-odour and 
eventually total loss of perfume on storage. A further 
drawback is that upon mixing with citric acid which is 
normally coarse crystalline, the sulphamic acid and/or 
maleic acid tend to segregate in the pack. It has now been found that these and other drawbacks which 
will be apparent in the further description, can be avoided 
or at least mitigated to a substantial degree, by 
granulatinq the fine crystalline acid material using a 
selected group of binding materials.  In a first aspect, the invention provides a process for 
granulating an organic crystalline material in order to 
increase particle size and improve flow properties, by 
adding a fine powder and a liquid, such that powder and 
liquid together form an interstitial binding material, 
gluing the original crystals together, and drying the 
mixture to remove excess water, said binding material being 
formed from a combination of: 
a) an inert, water-insoluble powdered material and an 
aqueous solution of a film-forming polymeric material; 
or b) an inert water-soluble powdered material and water, or 
an aqueous solution of a film-forming polymeric 
material. Examples of inert, water-insoluble materials usable herein 
are starch, such as potato starch, aluminosilicate powder, 
such as zeolites. As film-forming polymeric materials can be 
named homo- and copolymers of polycarboxylic acids, such as 
the polyacrylates and especially copolymers of maleic acid
