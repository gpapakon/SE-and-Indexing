<ABSTRACT>
The bridge plate hinges at its ramp end on a horizontal axis, and an extensible portion at the free end rests on the lorry platform. Vertical guard plates at the sides of the bridge plate bridge the gap between the latter and the ramp surface when the bridge plate is swung upwards. With it in the rest position, supports pendulum-suspended from it engage with a fixed stop in a recess formed in the ramp. Bars (12) fixed to the guard plates (10) form the suspension points for the supports (13), which are close to the plates. The stop is formed by brackets (15) fixed to the sidewalls (9) of the recess (4) in the ramp. The distance between each support and its guard plate can be appreciably less than the width of the support itself, while allowing the latter to swing freely. Each bar can be fixed to its plate and pass through it. The support can be prevented from sliding along the bar.

Transfer bridge for platforms (3), having a bridge 
plate (1) which is pivotably mounted at its platform end 

about a horizontal axis (2), and an extendable and 
retractable or outwardly and inwardly pivotable extension 

member (7), which is situated at the free end of the 
bridge plate (1), for deposit and support on the deck to be 

loaded or unloaded, the bridge plate (1) being provided on 
both lateral edges with vertical protective plates (10) to 

bridge the gap between the upwardly pivoted bridge plate 
(1) and the platform surface, and the bridge plate (1) 

being provided with supports (13), which are disposed in 
the region of its lateral edges, are supported in the 

inoperative position of the bridge plate (1) on a fixed 
abutment (15) in a platform recess and are oscillatingly 

pivotable about a horizontal axis, characterised in that 
the holders for the support mounting (12) are connected to 

the protective places (10), and the supports (13) are 
disposed close to the protective plates (10). 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the spacing between the supports (13) and the protective 

plates (10) is substantially smaller than the width of the 
supports (13). 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the supports (13) are disposed so close to the protective 

plates (10) that there is still some clearance between the 
supports and the associated protective plate (10), which 

clearance is sufficient for the free pivoting movement of 
the supports (13). 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
a rod (12), which is securely connected to the protective 

plate (10) and preferably traverses therethrough, serves as 
the pivotal axis for the supports (13).  

 
Bridge according to claims 1 and 4, characterised 
in that the supports (13) abut with their external surface 

against the protective plates (10) or are spaced with 
minimal clearance therefrom and prevented from being 

axially displaced internally on the rod (12). 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the abutments for the supports (13) are formed by brackets 

(15), which are mounted on the lateral walls (9) of the 
platform recess (4). 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
brackets (15), which are interconnected via a predominantly 

tensioned element (20), e.g. in the form of a cable or 
pipe, serve as the abutments for the supports (13). 
Bridge according to claim 7, characterised in that 
the brackets (15) are suspended from a vertical plate (19), 

which is situated practically beneath a platform edge (11).
