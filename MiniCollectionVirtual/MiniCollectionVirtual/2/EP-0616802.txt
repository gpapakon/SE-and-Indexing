<ABSTRACT>
An oral preparation for release in lower digestive tracts, prepared by filling a hard capsule made from a base mainly comprising 
chitosan with a solid preparation containing a principal agent and a solid organic acid which, in a dissolved state, can dissolve 

chitosan and forming an enteric coating on the surface of the capsule. The preparation enables any desired release time to 
be set without being affected by the pH by virtue of the water-permeability due to the porousness of the chitosan.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oral pharmaceutical
preparation of a type released at infragastrointestinal tract for
releasing a principal agent having pharmacological actions at
infragastrointestinal tract after the oral dosage thereof.Chitin is contained in the exoskeleton of crustaceans such
as crab, shrimp, krill, etc. and insects, as the constituent
components thereof, and is a naturally occurring basic
polysaccharide present in nature in widespread manner. The
chitin having a linear chain bonded with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine
and chitosan produced through the deacetylation of chitin have
been neglected and left alone as unused biological resources for
a long period of time. In recent years, however, the absence of
toxicity and the physico-chemical properties have been drawing
attention, leading to the progress in the active research works
for effective application of chitin and chitosan. Thus,
expectation has been directed toward the application thereof in a
wide variety of fields, for example, as coagulants, ion
exchangers, enzyme immobilizing agents, raw materials for hair
cosmetics, medicinal materials, food additives, soil modifiers, 
etc. Chitosan, in particular, is promising because it has
advantages, for example, in that it is readily dissolved in
dilute hydrochloric acid, aqueous solutions of organic acids and
the like, and that the glucosamine residue constituting the
molecular chain is a high molecular electrolyte having a free
primary amine group (-NH2).In the field of pharmaceutical products, alternatively,
investigation has been carried out toward a preparation technique
for advancing a pharmaceutical preparation to
infragastrointestinal tract such as the lower part of small
intestine, large intestine, etc., while suppressing the release
of the preparation in stomach and the upper part of small
intestine after the oral dosage thereof.Because physiologically active polypeptide hormones such as
insulin and calcitonin are water-soluble, high molecular
compounds readily decomposed via intestinal proteases such as
gastric juice, pepsin and trypsin, the development of an oral
pharmaceutical preparation of a type released at
infragastrointestinal tract is significant so as to make the
polypeptide hormones absorbed at infragastrointestinal tract
without the decomposition via the aforementioned proteases. The
development is also significant from the respect that
pharmaceutical agents effective for diseases of
infragastrointestinal tract, such as ulcerative colitis and 
Chron's disease, be
