<ABSTRACT>
Soluble fusion molecules were prepared which contained a CD11a/CD18 specific binding region operatively linked to an immunoglobulin constant region. These molecules particularly include extracellular portions of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 attached to IgG constant regions. The fusion molecules described are utilized as costimulatory agents for the activation of T cells and in methods for increasing CD4

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to soluble fusion molecules that possess a
region having a binding specificity for CD11a/CD18 and a region corresponding to an
immunoglobulin constant region, such as a recombinant molecule containing an
extracellular CD11a/Cd18 binding region of ICAM-2 and a constant region of an IgG.
The molecules of the present invention are further utilized in in vitro methods to affect T cell
responses and activity as well as for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions which
affect T cell responses and activity.The CD3/TCR (T cell antigen receptor) complex on the surface of T cells not
only recognizes nonself antigen (Ag) in the context of self major histocompatibility
(MHC) molecules expressed on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC) but also
participates in signal transduction to initiate the activation of T cells (Clevers H. et al.
(1988) Ann. Rev. Immuno. 6:629). The interaction between CD3/TCR and Ag/MHC
on APC, although essential to initiate the activation of T cells, is usually not sufficient
and requires participation of additional cell-surface molecules which mediate adhesion
and/or signal transduction for optimal expression of various functions of activated T
cells (Clevers H. et al. (1988) Ann. Rev. Immuno. 6:629; Springer T.A. (1990)
Nature 346:425; Moller G. (1990) Immunol. Rev. 114:1-217).The leukocyte adhesion molecule LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) expressed on the
surface of all mature leukocytes mediates a wide range of interactions with other
somatic cells during the immune response and inflammation by interaction with its
ligand the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1/CD54) (Springer T.A. (1990)
Nature 346:425; Moller G. (1990); Moller G. (1990) Immunol. Rev. 114:217;

et al. (1988) Eur. J. Immunol. 18:35; Altmann D.M. et al. (1989) Nature 338:512).
ICAM-1 is constitutively expressed on some tissues and induced on others during
inflammation (Dustin M. L. et al. (1986) J. Immunol. 137:245). ICAM-1 provides an
important costimulatory signal via its adhesive interaction with LFA-1 during the
CD3/TCR-mediated activation of resting T cells (Van Seventer G.A. et al. (1990) J.
Immunol. 144:4579). Recently, another ligand for LFA-1,
