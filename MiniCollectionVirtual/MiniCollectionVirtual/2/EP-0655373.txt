<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a connection piece (10) for connecting the U-shaped hooked end of a wiper arm to a wiper articulation pin, of the type including two parallel cheeks (12) each of which includes a slot (28) emerging in a bearing housing (30) of the articulation pin formed in a tubular length of bearing (32) the external cylindrical surface (36) of which is accommodated in the bottom of the U-shaped hook, characterised in that it includes a second portion of cylindrical surface (54) which can be accommodated in the bottom (42') of the U-shaped hook (40') of the end of a wiper arm (38') so as to allow two wiper arms of different sizes to be fitted.

A connector (10) for joining the end, in the form
of a U-shaped hook, of a first screen wiper arm to a

pivot pin which extends transversely between two
parallel side wing portions of a structural element for

supporting the wiping strip of a screen wiper blade,
being of the type having two parallel side portions

(12), the outer faces (14) of which are arranged to be
received between the inner faces of the side wing

portions, the inner faces (16), facing towards each
other, of the parallel side portions being arranged to

cooperate with the parallel side edges of the terminal
hook of the said first screen wiper arm, being further

of the type in which each of the two parallel portions
(12) includes a slot (28) which is open firstly in a

lower longitudinal edge (20) of the side portion (12),
and secondly into a bearing housing (30), into which

the pivot pin can be introduced radially and which is
formed in a tubular bearing element (32) that extends

transversely between the parallel side portions (12),
the outer cylindrical surface (36) of the tubular

bearing element being received in the base of the U-shaped
hook at the end of the said first screen wiper

arm, being further of the type in which the two
parallel side portions are joined together by a 

transverse thrust bar (44) which is located close to
the upper longitudinal edges (18) of the side portions

(12) at the rear end of the connector (10), and which
cooperates with a facing portion of the upper face of

the body of the screen wiper arm, and being further of
the type comprising a second cylindrical surface

portion (54) which is offset longitudinally towards the
front of the connector (10) with respect to the tubular

bearing element (32), and which is adapted to be
received in the base (42') of the U-shaped hook (40')

at the end of a second screen wiper arm (38'), so as to
enable two screen wiper arms of different dimensions to

be fitted, characterised in that the said second
cylindrical surface portion (54) is formed on a

transverse element (52) which extends between the
parallel side portions (12), and in that the connector

includes a transverse abutment plate portion (58) which
extends between the parallel side portions (12) and

which faces towards the said second cylindrical surface
portion (54).
A connector according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the radii of curvature of the two cylindrical

surfaces (36, 54) are different.
A connector according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterised in that, in longitudinal cross section,

the transverse element (52) has a half-moon shape, the
straight edge (56) of which lies in substantially 

facing relationship with the tubular bearing element
(32).
A connector according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the abutment plate portion (58)

is disposed close to the front edges (22) of the
parallel side portions (12).
A connector according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that each of the inner faces

(16) of the parallel side portions (12) includes a stop
nose (48) adapted to cooperate with a facing portion

(50, 50') of the lower face of the body (38, 38') of
the first or second screen wiper arm.
A connector according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that it is made by moulding in

a plastics material.
