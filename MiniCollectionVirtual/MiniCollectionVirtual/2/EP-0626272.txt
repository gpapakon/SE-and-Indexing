<ABSTRACT>
A heat-sensitive recording material is prepared by forming a 
heat-sensitive recording layer on a synthetic paper having a 

laminated structure. The synthetic paper has a front surface having a 
smoothness (in accordance with JIS P-8119) of not less than 2000 

seconds on which the heat-sensitive recording layer is provided, and a 
back surface having a smoothness of not more than 1000 seconds, and 

has an opacity (in accordance with JIS P-8138) of not higher than 40 
%. The heat-sensitive recording material is superior in recording 

runnability and recording quality, and gives recorded materials 
useful as a second original for diazo print.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a heat-sensitive recording
material and more particularly to a heat-sensitive recording material
in which a synthetic paper is used as a base sheet and which is
superior in recording runnability and recording quality, and gives
recorded materials useful as a second original for diazo print or
diazo duplication.According to the development of manufacturing technology of
semiconductor, a wide single thermal head could be manufactured
efficiently at a low cost as a thermal head used in heat-sensitive
recording system. Since thermal plotters equipped with the head can
print wide letters with a high printing speed and require no
maintainance, they have gradually supplanted conventional pen
plotters.Further, images recorded by these plotters are mainly the
figures drawn by CAD and used as the originals for diazo duplication.
Accordingly, as the recorded materials are supplied as the secondary
originals for diazo duplication, transparency is required
for the medium. A semitransparent or transparent heat-sensitive
recording material in which a transparent film is used as the support
has been required as a medium for heat-sensitive recording system.On the other hand, the wide thermal plotter mentioned above 
is different from usual heat-sensitive equipments such as facsimile
and the like. In the case, the medium is generally transferred by
driving a driving roll equipped downstream of the nip portion between
the thermal head and the platen roll as shown in Figure 1. When the
recording is made on a heat-sensitive recording material using a
transparent film as the support in such a thermal plotter, the
driving roll idles at the nip portion between the driving roll and the
plate usually Teflon®-lined and troubles of abnormal transfer of the
heat-sensitive recording material occur in a high frequency.The cause of the trouble can be assumed that, though the
reverse surface of the heat-sensitive recording material using a
transparent film as the support is usually not processed or back-coated
to some g/m2, the support has a very high smoothness compared
to paper and common synthetic paper even if back-coated, and therefore
the reverse surface of the heat-sensitive recording material adheres
tightly with the plate surface at the nip portion between the driving
roll and the plate so that the driving roll idles. As a
countermeasure for this trouble, it can be considered that a pigment
of relatively large particle size is added to the back coat layer to
roughen the reverse surface of the heat
