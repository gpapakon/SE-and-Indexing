<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an offset
amount measuring apparatus suitable for use in measuring
an offset amount in reproduced signals resulting from an
offset between the center of the circular data track of a
disk and the center of rotation of the disk.Conventionally, the measurement of an offset
amount produced at the time of chucking a disk having
circular data tracks on the revolving shaft of a spindle
motor has been carried out with the use of a precision
rotating stage and a microscope.Such an offset amount measuring method is
difficult to practice in a small disk drive apparatus.A method of correcting the offset of the disk
produced when it is chucked is disclosed in Japanese
Patent Laid-open No. Sho 63-61478. This method is such
that has a dedicated area provided on the disk to form
therein a position signal pattern to measure an offset
amount, the offset amount is measured from a reproduced
signal of the pattern, and the offset amount measured is
used for offset correction.Also, EP-A-0,516,125 discloses a disk apparatus
for writing on a re-writable disk including means for
adjusting the write clock on the basis of a signal which
gives a measure of the offset produced when a disk is
mounted on the disk apparatus by chucking. The disk is
provided with N (N being an integer greater than 1) clock
mark signals recorded at physically regular intervals
around a single circular data track disposed separately
from the main data area of the disk. The disk apparatus
reads the clock mark signals from the circular data track
with a head which is dedicated to that task and separate
from the main data reading head. The disk apparatus uses
a reference pulse derived from the reproduced clock mark
signals output by the dedicated head while the head is 
positioned at a distance of predetermined radius from the
center of rotation of said disk. The frequency of this
reference pulse is related to the distance between a locus
of said dedicated head traced on said disk when the same
is rotated and said circular data track. The write clock
is adjusted on the basis of the reference pulse.In such cases, however, it is required to
provide a dedicated area on the disk for the measurement
of the offset amount and the dedicated area has to have a
sufficient margin in order that the position signal for
the offset amount measurement is read not affected by the
offset. Hence, there arises a problem that the data
recording capacity of the disk is decreased accordingly.Further, sometimes noise is produced superposed
on the
