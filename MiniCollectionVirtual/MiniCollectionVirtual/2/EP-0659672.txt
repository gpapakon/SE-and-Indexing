<ABSTRACT>
Cutter for cutting yarn in oscillating motion in textile machines, 
characterised in that it comprises a first upper mobile cutting element 

(16), a second lower fixed cutting element (18) co-operating with said 
first cutting element (16) in the cutting of yarn, a stem (20) for supporting 

said first mobile cutting element (16) and means (34) for driving the 
stem (20) acting to drive the movement of said first mobile cutting 

element (16) upwards, away from said second fixed cutting element 
(18) and downwards, towards and against said second fixed cutting 

element (18) in order to cut the yarn, with said stem (20) for supporting 
and driving said mobile part (16) which in the raised position defines a 

part for interception of the yarn in oscillating motion.

<DESCRIPTION>
It is known that in textile machines the performance of certain
operations requires the yarn to be drawn by suitable parts in
reciprocating motion which make it move in an oscillating or waving
manner.It is likewise known that, in some situations, for example in the
automatic change of reels in an automatic winding textile machine, it is
necessary to cut such a yarn in oscillating motion by means of
automatically driven parts in order to interrupt its feed towards a reel
which has completed filling (see e.g. DE-A-1560453).Known devices, which perform this operation of cutting yarn in
oscillating or waving motion, have various disadvantages including
that of cutting the yarn only if the latter arrives from a well-defined part
of the cutting device, so that, if these known devices are actuated at the
moment when the yarn is on the opposite side, not suitable for 
shearing, in order to cut said yarn it is necessary to wait until the latter
goes back and is arranged in the direction suitable for shearing.This delayed intervention by the shearing device involves the risk that
the yarn not sheared in time can become tangled up in parts of the
textile machine, making it inoperative. Moreover it always entails a
waste of time which slows down subsequent operations of the textile
machine.Other disadvantages of known devices consist of the fact that they
often have a structure which is too complex and the fact that they are
not always able to perform cutting operations reliably.In some known cutting devices the cutting blades may in fact close
ineffectively on cutting the yarn, for example leaving gaps between the
closed and touching cutting edges, inside whereof the yarn may be
deposited and hence not cut.In other cases known cutting devices do not have suitable elements for
intercepting the yarn in a waving movement so that said yarn may wind
around the non-cutting elements of the device and make cutting
impossible.The object of the present invention is that of providing a cutter for
cutting yarn in oscillating motion in textile machines with which it is 
possible to achieve a high intervention speed, that is to say a cutter for
cutting a yarn which is able to intervene on an oscillating yarn which
comes from both sides of the cutter.Another object of the present invention is that of providing a cutter for
cutting a yarn in textile machines thanks to which the cutting operation
is performed reliably, without the possibility of failures of the device.A further object of the present invention is that of providing
