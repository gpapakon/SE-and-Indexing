<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dye-donor element 
for thermal dye transfer, and more particularly to the 
use of a transferable protection overcoat in the 
element for transfer to a thermal print. In recent years, thermal transfer systems 
have been developed to obtain prints from pictures 
which have been generated electronically from a color 
video camera. According to one way of obtaining such 
prints, an electronic picture is first subjected to 
color separation by color filters. The respective 
color-separated images are then converted into 
electrical signals. These signals are then operated on 
to produce cyan, magenta and yellow electrical signals. 
These signals are then transmitted to a thermal 
printer. To obtain the print, a cyan, magenta or 
yellow dye-donor element is placed face-to-face with a 
dye-receiving element. The two are then inserted 
between a thermal printing head and a platen roller. A 
line-type thermal printing head is used to apply heat 
from the back of the dye-donor sheet. The thermal 
printing head has many heating elements and is heated 
up sequentially in response to the cyan, magenta and 
yellow signals. The process is then repeated for the 
other two colors. A color hard copy is thus obtained 
which corresponds to the original picture viewed on a 
screen. Further details of this process and an 
apparatus for carrying it out are contained in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,621,271. Thermal prints are susceptible to retransfer 
of dyes to adjacent surfaces and to discoloration by 
fingerprints. This is due to dye being at the surface 
of the dye-receiving layer of the print. These dyes 
can be driven further into the dye-receiving layer by 
thermally fusing the print with either hot rollers or a  
 
thermal head. This will help to reduce dye retransfer 
and fingerprint susceptibility, but does not eliminate 
these problems. However, the application of a 
protective overcoat will practically eliminate these 
problems. U.S. Patent 4,738,555 discloses a dye-donor 
element for thermal dye transfer wherein a transparent 
ink region is also present on the element which is used 
to form a protective layer over the printed image. The 
materials disclosed in this patent for the protective 
layer are "wax, vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, acrylic 
resin, styrene or epoxy." U.S. Patent 4,666,320 also 
discloses materials to be applied as a protective layer 
on a thermal dye transfer image. The materials 
disclosed in this patent are "polyester resin, epoxy 
resin, cellulose acetate resin, nylon
