<ABSTRACT>
The extracoronal attachment described and claimed has, as in the prior art, a counterdie (14, 16) secured to a crowned or intact tooth (12) and a die (40) mounted on a false tooth (52). The die has the shape of a housing (42) open towards the counterdie and in which a frictional element (30) made of plastic which is stable in the mouth is inserted. This frictional element is used, during the manufacture of the attachment, as an auxiliary liner element.

Extracoronal attachment including a male member (10) 
which is attachable to a solid denture (12) and a female 

member (40) which is slidable onto said male member and 
to which a prosthesis portion (52) is attached, the male 

member (10) consisting of an essentially block-shaped 
fastening portion (16) and of a retention portion (14) 

while the female member (40) has the shape of a shell 
which is laterally open on the side of the male member 

and a laterally open, sleeve-shaped friction portion 
(30) of an orally stable synthetic material is inserted 

in the female member (4) which forms a frictional 
connection with the retention portion (14) of the male 

member (10) and is identical to a duplicating aid which 
is used in the preparation of the attachment, characterised 

in that the female member (40) comprises axial 
connecting beads (44) which provide a form-fit and a 

positive connection with the male member (10) and fit 
into corresponding stabilising grooves (20) of the 

block-shaped fastening portion (16) of the male part 
(10) and enter in the same, as well as matching contact 

surfaces (22, 23) of the fastening portion (16) of the 
male member and corresponding surfaces (46, 48) of the 

female member, the cross-section of the axial connecting 
beads (44) and the stabilising grooves (20) essentially 

having the shape of a circle segment whose arc length is 
smaller than half the circle circumference.
 
Attachment according to claim 1, characterised in 
that a set of friction portions is provided whose external 

diameters are essentially equal but whose internal 
diameters are successively smaller, whereby the frictional 

forces between the male and the female members are 
capable of being determined by inserting the desired 

friction portion.  
 
Attachment according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the external diameter of the friction portion 

(30) and the internal diameter of the female member (40) 
as well as the internal diameter of the friction portion 

(30) and the external diameter of the retention portion 
(14) of the male member (10) conform to each other at 

least approximately. 
Attachment according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the retention portion (14) of the 

male member (10) has the shape of a circular cylinder 
(17) which is connected to the fastening portion (16) of 

the male member by means of a web (19). 
Method for the preparation of an attachment according 
to any one of claims 1 to 4, according to which a 

duplicate model of the attachment is produced by means 
of a laterally open, sleeve-shaped duplicating aid (30) 

which is slid over the already finished male member, the 
duplicating aid consisting of a heat-unerodable, orally 

stable synthetic material, is retired from the male member 
before the corresponding embedding material model is 

produced, and used as a friction portion (30) which is 
inserted in the female member, characterised in that 

stabilising grooves (20) are made in the male member and 
matching axial connecting beads (44) in the female member 

which fit into corresponding stabilising grooves 
(20) of the block-shaped fastening portion (16) of the 

male member and enter in the same, in that matching 
contact surfaces (22, 23) of the fastening portion (16) 

of the male member and corresponding surfaces (46, 48) 
of the female member are produced, and in that the axial 

connecting beads (44) and the stabilising grooves (20) 
are provided with essentially circle segment-shaped  

 
cross-sections whose arc length is smaller than half the 

circle circumference.
