<ABSTRACT>
MWD apparatus for measuring the stand-off distance 
of a drillstring (20) from a borehole wall (24) uses a 

single acoustic transducer (34) mounted on a drill 
collar (26) near a tubular member (30), such as an upset 

or stabilizer blade, which is of greater diameter than 
the collar (26). Control apparatus (36) determines 

roundtrip times (RTT) of pulses from the transducer (34) 
to the borehole wall (24) and back. The minimum stand-off 

is the known radial difference (R2-R1) between the 
MWD drill collar (26) and the tubular member (30) when 

the drillstring (20) is side-walled against the borehole 
wall (24). RTT values are measured and statistically 

analyzed to identify and verify the minimum stand-off 
distance (RTT
min
). The RTT values may be analyzed 
directly or using histogram techniques. The sound speed 

of the drilling fluid (26) is calculated as twice the 
radial difference (R2-R1) divided by the minimum stand-off 

(RTT
min
). The sound speed is used to calculate the 
stand-off distance corresponding to other RTT values.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for measuring the sound speed of drilling
fluid for use in accurately calculating the stand-off
distance between a drillstring and the borehole wall
while drilling subterranean oil and gas wells.Apparatus for measuring the inner diameter of a
borehole is well known in the art, where a borehole is
a well bore drilled into the earth. Until recently,
sonde-type devices were commonly used to make such
measurements, where a sonde is a wireline device
lowered into the borehole after drilling operations
have ceased. Borehole measurements using sonde devices
is very time consuming and costly, especially
considering the fact that drilling operations must
cease and the drillstring must be removed. Early sonde
devices used mechanical calipers extending from the
sonde to contact the borehole wall to measure the
borehole diameter. There are several disadvantages
associated with the use of mechanical devices,
including significant maintenance, frequent failures
and breakdowns and a high incidence of inaccurate
measurements. Mechanical devices may also cause damage
to steel casing of the well.More recently, ultrasonic acoustic devices have
been developed for measuring various parameters,
including borehole diameter and stand-off distances in 
a borehole. At first, the acoustic devices were
mounted on a sonde and lowered into the borehole, so
that drilling operations still had to be interrupted
while the measurements were being made. Also, the
sonde had to be mounted with several acoustic devices
around the circumference of the sonde for making the
appropriate measurements, since the sonde typically did
not rotate. Furthermore, the sonde devices with
multiple acoustic devices could be very complex and
costly.Subsequently, measurement-while-drilling (MWD)
techniques have been developed to overcome the
disadvantages of sonde devices. MWD measuring tools
typically take advantage of acoustic devices and
transducers, where these devices are mounted on or
within one or more MWD drill collars provided on the
drillstring. The drillstring includes a series of
drill pipes serially linked to a series of drill
collars. The drill collars are connected to a drill
bit used to drill the borehole. The primary function
of the drill collars is to provide a downward thrust or
weight on the drill bit. Since the stand-off
measurements were made while the drillstring is in the
borehole, the measurements were typically made of the
stand-off distance between the drillstring and the
borehol
