<ABSTRACT>
A radio telecommunication system has radio channels, each 
radio channel including a plurality of slots generated by time 

division. The system encompasses a plurality of areas having a 
base station which sends a first signal over a predetermined slot 

of the slots. If the signal quality of the first signal received 
by a portable apparatus is less than a criterion, non-used at 

least one of the slots is designated. The portable apparatus 

sends a second signal over the predetermined slot and the 
designated slot.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a radio
telecommunication system for use in a radio telecommunication
apparatus such as a portable telecommunication apparatus or a
mobile telecommunication apparatus, and more particularly to a
radio telecommunication system capable of maintaining the quality
of signals received by the radio telecommunication apparatus.FIG. 18 shows a block diagram illustrating a digital radio
telecommunication system. The system includes a control station
CS connected to a landline network NW. The control station CS is
further connected to plural base stations BS1, BS2, BS3 ... over
landlines CL1, CL2, CL3,.... Each base station has its own radio
zone E1, E2, E3,.... Each portable apparatus communicates over
radio channels with the base station in the radio zone in which it
is located. Further each portable apparatus is connected to the
landline network NW through the base station BS and the control
station CS.This system adopts a time division multiple access system,
referred to as a TDMA system, as a communication system. In the
TDMA system, each radio channel for a downward channel and for an
upward channel includes a plurality of time frames. Each frame
includes six time slots. In the event that a communication link
is formed between the base station and the portable station, one
time slot for the downward signal is assigned from the downward 
radio channel and one time slot for the upward signal is assigned from the upward radio
channel. After that, the portable apparatus receives the downward signal in the
assigned downward slot and sends the upward signal in the assigned upward slot. FIG.
18 shows downward slots in each downward channel and upward slots in each upward
channel. Referring to FIG. 18, if the portable apparatus PS is assigned TS1 as a
downward slot and assigned TS1' as an upward slot, the portable apparatus PS sends
the intermittent upward signal to the base station BS during a period corresponding to
the upward slot TS1'. Furthermore, the portable apparatus PS receives the downward
signal during a period corresponding to a downward slot TS1. Thus, the upward slot
TS1' is defined as a transmit slot and the downward slot TS1 is defined as a receive slot.
During a period corresponding to the downward slots TS2, TS3, TS4, TS5, the
apparatus PS sends no signal to the base station BS. Therefore, the slots
corresponding to the slots TS2, TS3, TS4, TS5 are defined as an idle slot. The above
six slots TS1 - TS6 repeat in every frame. However, if an obstacle such
