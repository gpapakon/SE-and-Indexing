<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for providing proper 
electrical contact between corresponding interconnect pads 

(61, 85) of a print cartridge (24, 25, 26 or 27) and a 
print carriage (30) are disclosed. One end (91) of a 

flexible insulating tape (87) including interconnect pads 
(85) of the print carriage (30) is attached to one side of 

the print carriage (30) while the other end (92) of the 
flexible insulating tape (87) may be substantially free or 

attached to an opposing side of the print carriage (30). 
When the print cartridge (24, 25, 26 or 27) is 
initially inserted into the print carriage (30), a gimbal 

spring (106) causes the flexible insulating 
tape interconnect pads (85) to preliminarily come in 

contact with the print cartridge interconnect pads (61) 
before the print cartridge (24, 25, 26 or 27) is 

completely inserted. As the print cartridge (24, 25, 26 
or 27) is further inserted, the print cartridge (24, 25, 

26 or 27) pushes out any excess slack in the flexible 
insulating tape (87) while providing a wiping action 

between the interconnect pads (61, 85) of the print 
cartridge (24, 25, 26 or 27) and the print carriage (30). 

This wiping action between the interconnect pads (61, 85) 
scrapes away any contaminants and corrosion, thus ensuring 

reliable electrical contact.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to printers
and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for
ensuring good electrical contact between interconnect
pads on a print cartridge and the corresponding
interconnect pads in the stall of a print carriage. Inkjet printheads operate by ejecting a droplet of
ink through a nozzle and onto a recording medium, such as
a sheet of paper. When a number of nozzles are arranged
in a pattern, such as a rectangular matrix, the properly
sequenced ejection of ink from each nozzle causes
characters or other images to be printed on the paper as
the printhead is moved relative to the paper. The
printhead is usually part of a disposable print cartridge
containing a supply of ink. The print cartridge is
designed for easy installation and removal from a stall in
the print carriage. Print cartridges are installed and
removed hundreds of times over the life of a print
carriage.In one type of thermal inkjet print cartridge, the
print cartridge includes: 1) an ink reservoir and ink
channels to supply ink proximate to each of the nozzles;
2) a print head in which the nozzles are formed in a
desired pattern; 3) a substrate attached to a bottom
surface of the print head, a series of thin film heater
resistors being formed on the substrate, generally one
resistor below each nozzle and 4) interconnect pads formed
on an insulating tape with which electrical connections
are made to corresponding interconnect pads on the print
carriage.To print a dot of ink from a nozzle, an electrical
current is passed through paired interconnect pads of the
print carriage and the print cartridge to a selected
resistor of the print cartridge. The heater is ohmically
heated, in turn heating a thin layer of adjacent ink.
This results in vaporization of the ink, vapor bubbles in
the ink causing a droplet of ink to be ejected through an
associated nozzle onto the paper. The resistors in the
substrate are connected by conductors formed on the
insulating tape to interconnect pads on the insulating 
tape. The interconnect pads, the conductors and the
insulating tape are collectively known as the TAB circuit,
since the insulating tape is bonded to the print head by
the well-known tape automated bonding (TAB) process.There are several problems associated with the prior
art devices that result in inadequate electrical contact
between corresponding interconnect. In the prior art, the
interconnect pads of the print carriage were terminal
points of a circuit formed on a flexible insulating tape

carriage (30), and wherein the flexible insulating tape (87) is bent around a

portion (96) of the print carriage (30); and

   wherein said flexible insulating tape includes a second end (92) opposite the
first end (91), said second end forming a free floating slack in the flexible

insulating tape (87) located around the bend of said portion (96).
