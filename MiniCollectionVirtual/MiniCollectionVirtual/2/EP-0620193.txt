<ABSTRACT>
A parison transfer mechanism comprises two neck-ring arms 
which are mounted for rotation about a horizontal axis, 

which axis is inclined to a central axis of a section in 
which the mechanism is mounted. This allows for several 

arrangements of pairs of such mechanism in a section so that 
the two mechanisms can operate independently of each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a transfer mechanism
for transferring and inverting parisons in a section of a
glassware forming machine from a blank station where the
parisons are formed in a parison mould to a second forming
station where the parison is blown to form a container in a
blow mould.A conventional I.S. glass container forming machine
comprises a series of sections arranged along side each
other and operating out of phase with each other. Each
section is equipped with a single parison transfer mechanism
carrying one or more neck-rings. Taking single gob
operation as an example, the machine cycle commences with
the neck-ring in a reverted position and the parison mould
closed around it. A charge of glass enters the upper end of
the parison mould and is blown or pressed into a parison
shape with some glass being forced into the space between
the neck-ring and a plunger to form a finish end of the
final container. The parison mould then opens leaving the
parison held by its finish end in the neck-ring. The invert
mechanism then operates to carry the parison from the
parison forming station and to invert it into the blow mould
station where the blow mould closes around it. The
neck-ring is then opened, dropping the parison into the blow
mould where it is supported by a bead formed on the finish.
The invert mechanism returns the neck-ring to the parison
forming station and the parison mould closes around it ready
for the next charge of glass. Meanwhile the parison hanging
in the blow mould is blown into the final container.Various steps have been taken in recent years to
increase the speed of the container forming process e.g. by
the introduction of axial mould cooling methods and the
reduction in the wall thickness of the finished container.
However, the thickness of the glass in the finish has not 
been reduced to the same extent and in lightweight
containers today the thickest glass is often to be found
here. As machine speeds have increased, the time available
for the forming and cooling of the glass in the finish has
become disproportionately reduced. This is a particular
problem when the parison is formed by a plunger in a press
process, for the neck-ring is the last part of the parison
mould equipment to be filled with glass. The result is that
the glass in the finish is not cool enough, and thus not
hard enough to maintain its shape accurately when the
parison is transferred to the blow mould, leading to
subsequent distortion and loss of ware. Further reduction
