<ABSTRACT>
A method for imparting topographical features to a permanent substrate employing a sheet material comprising a thermosettable pressure-sensitive adhesive composition. The edges of the sheet material are caused to flow prior to the thermosetting reaction to provide smooth transition lines between an exposed surface of the sheet material and the permanent substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TOPOGRAPHICAL METHODFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a method for providing topographical features to a substrate.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONU.S. Patent No. 5,086,088 discloses a latent, thermosettable pressure-sensitive adhesive composition comprising an acrylate pressure- sensitive adhesive and an epoxy resin component which provides for the thermoset cure. The adhesive composition is disclosed as being useful to fasten roof molding to a car body.BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INSTANT INVENTION The instant invention provides a novel method for imparting topographical or protective features to a permanent substrate, comprising the steps of: a) providing a dissevered, hardenable sheet material having first and second major surfaces, comprising a latent, thermosettable pressure-sensitive adhesive throughout a major portion of its thickness, and exhibiting pressure-sensitive adhesive properties at the first major surface; b) contacting and adhering the first major surface of the sheet material to the permanent substrate or a temporary substrate leaving the second major surface of the sheet material exposed; c) substantially thermosetting and substantially hardening the sheet material in a manner permitting initial, controlled mass flow of the sheet material substantially in its thickness direction to provide a substantially smooth transition between the second surface of said sheet material and the permanent substrate or the temporary substrate to which it has been adhered; and 

 d) in the event the hardened sheet material is adhered to the temporary substrate, removing the hardened sheet material therefrom and thereafter fastening (e.g., adhering) the first major surface of the sheet material to the permanent substrate. In a preferred method, the sheet material is adhered to the permanent substrate in the first instance.The method of the invention finds particular utility in the application of sheet material to primed or unprimed metal automobile parts or bodies to seal metal parts or provide emblems or insignia or design elements such as trim. The resulting laminate is aesthetic since the hardened sheet material exhibits smooth, rounded edges relative to the substrate, and can be painted or otherwise decorated as desired to match or complement the remainder of the automobile.Another application of the method of the invention is in the fabrication of signs or the like which are then adhered to the permanent surface by means of an adhesive distinct from the sheet material exployed in making the

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method for imparting topographical or protective features to a permanent substrate comprising the steps of: a) providing a dissevered, hardenable sheet material having first and second major surfaces, comprising a latent thermosettable pressure-sensitive adhesive throughout a major portion of its thickness, and exhibiting pressure-sensitive adhesive properties at said first major surface; b) contacting and adhering said first major surface of said sheet material to said permanent substrate or a temporary substrate leaving said second major surface of said sheet material exposed; c) substantially thermosetting and substantially hardening said sheet material in a manner permitting initial, controlled mass flow of the sheet material substantially in its thickness direction to provide a substantially smooth transition between said second surface of said sheet material and said permanent substrate or said temporary substrate to which it has been adhered; and d) in the event said hardened sheet material is adhered to said temporary substrate, removing said hardened sheet material therefrom and thereafter fastening said first major surface of said sheet material to said permanent substrate.
2. A method according to Claim 1, wherein step b) involves the contacting and adhering of said first major surface of said sheet material to said permanent substrate.
3. A method according to Claim 1, wherein step b) involves the contacting and adhering of said first major surface of said sheet material to said temporary substrate. 


 4. A method according to Claim 1, wherein step c) is accomplished by heating said sheet material.
5. A method according to Claim 4, wherein step c) is accomplished by heating said sheet material to a temperature sufficient to decrease its modulus and thereby permitting said controlled mass flow, followed by heating said sheet material to a higher temperature resulting in substantially thermosetting and substantially hardening said sheet material.
6. A method according to Claim 5, wherein step c) is accomplished by a continuous increase in temperature of said sheet material.
7. A method according to Claim 1, further comprising the step of painting said second major surface of said sheet material prior to step c).
8. A method according to Claim 1, further comprising the step of painting said second major surface of said sheet material subsequent to step c).
9. A method according to Claim 1, wherein said thermosettable pressure-sensitive adhesive exhibits pressure-sensitive adhesive properties at ambient temperature.
10. A method according to Claim 1, wherein said sheet material comprises said thermosettable pressure-sensitive adhesive throughout substantially its entire thickness.
