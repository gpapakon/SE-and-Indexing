<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a novel enteric-coated oral dosage form of a risedronate active ingredient comprised of a safe and effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition which is comprised of a risedronate active ingredient and pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients. Said dosage forms prohibit the exposure of the risedronate active ingredient to the epithelial and mucosal tissues of the buccal cavity, pharynx, esophagus, and stomach and thereby protects said tissues from erosion, ulceration or other like irritation. Accordingly, the said dosage forms effect the delivery to the lower intestinal tract of said human or other mammal of a safe and effective amount of the risedronate active ingredient, and substantially alleviate the esophagitis or esophageal irritation which sometimes accompanies the oral administration of risedronate active ingredients.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel oral dosage forms of
the diphosphonate compound, 3-pyridyl-1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-bisphosphonic
acid, hereinafter referred to as "risedronate".
Said novel dosage forms are enteric-coated and delay the release
of the risedronate until the lower intestinal tract is reached,
thereby protecting the epithelial and mucosal tissues of the
mouth and the buccal cavity, the pharynx, the larynx, and the
esophagus from erosion, ulceration, or other like irritation
suffered by direct contact of these tissues with the risedronate
active ingredient which may sometimes result from the oral
administration of risedronate.Polyphosphonic acids and their pharmaceutically-acceptable
salts have been proposed for use in the treatment and prophylaxis
of a number of pathological conditions which can affect humans or
other mammals and involve calcium and phosphate metabolism. Such
conditions may be divided into two broad categories:
1. Conditions which are characterized by anomalous
mobilization of calcium and phosphate leading to general or
specific bone loss or excessively high calcium and phosphate
levels in the fluids of the body. Such conditions are sometimes
referred to herein as pathological hard tissue demineralizations. 2. Conditions which cause or result from deposition of
calcium and phosphate anomalously in the body. These conditions
are sometimes referred to herein as pathological calcifications.The first category includes osteoporosis, a condition in
which bone hard tissue is lost disproportionately to the
development of new hard tissue. Marrow and bone spaces become
larger, fibrous binding decreases, and compact bone becomes
fragile. Osteoporosis can be subclassified as menopausal,
senile, drug induced (e.g., adrenocorticoid, as can occur in
steroid therapy), disease induced (e.g., arthritic and tumor),
etc., however, the manifestations are essentially the same.
Another condition in the first category is Paget's disease
(osteitis deformans). In this disease, dissolution of normal
bone occurs which is then haphazardly replaced by soft, poorly
mineralized tissue such that the bone becomes deformed from
pressures of weight bearing, particularly in the tibia and femur.
Hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia of malignancy, and osteolytic
bone metastases are conditions also included in the first
category.The second category, involving-conditions manifested by
anomalous calcium and phosphate deposition, includes myositis
ossificans progressiva, calcinosis universalis, and such
affliction

<CLAIMS>
An oral dosage form comprising a safe and effective
amount, preferably from 0.25% to 40.00%, of a risedronate active

ingredient, characterized in that it is enterically coated and
further comprises a safe and effective amount, preferably from

60.00% to 99.75%, of pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients, and wherein
said oral dosage form prohibits the delivery of the risedronate active ingredient from the

dosage form until it reaches the lower intestinal tract.
A dosage form according to Claim 1 wherein the enteric
coating is a pH-dependent coating, preferably wherein said

enteric coating is insoluble at pH below 5.5 but soluble at pH
5.5 or above and said oral dosage form is a delayed-release

pharmaceutical composition.
A dosage form according to any one of the preceding
Claims wherein said enteric coating is insoluble in the

gastrointestinal fluids of the buccal cavity, pharynx, esophagus,
and stomach, but soluble in the gastrointestinal fluids of the

small and large intestine.
A dosage form according to any one of the preceding
Claims wherein said coating is comprised of anionic carboxylic

polymers, preferably an anionic carboxylic polymer which is a
partly-methyl-esterified methacrylic acid polymer wherein the

ratio of anionic free carboxyl groups to ester groups is about
1:1.
A dosage form according to Claim 1 wherein said enteric
coating is a pH dependent coating, and preferably wherein said

enteric coating is insoluble at a pH below 7.0 and soluble in pH
7.0 or above, and said oral dosage form is a delayed-release

pharmaceutical composition.
A dosage form according to Claim 5 wherein said enteric
coating is insoluble in the gastrointestinal fluids of the buccal 

cavity, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine but
soluble in the gastrointestinal fluids of the large intestine.
A dosage form according to any one of Claims 5 or 6,
wherein said coating is comprised of anionic carboxylic polymers,

and preferably wherein said anionic carboxylic polymer is a
partly-methyl-esterified methacrylic acid polymer wherein the

ratio of anionic free carboxyl groups to ester groups is about
1:2.
A dosage form according to Claim 1 wherein the enteric
coating is a pH-independent coating and said oral dosage form is

a sustained-release pharmaceutical composition, and preferably
wherein said enteric coating is a polymer selected from

ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and
carboxymethyl cellulose.
An oral dosage form according to any one of the
preceding Claims wherein said dosage form is a compressed tablet

comprising particles of the risedronate active ingredient and
pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients.
