<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a conductive
paste, and more particularly to a conductive paste used
for interconnecting wiring layers of a ceramic multilayer
wiring substrate on which chip components such as
an LSI and an IC are mounted.A green sheet stacking method and a thick
film printing method have widely been used for producing
a ceramic multilayer substrate. These methods
respectively have advantages: According to the green
sheet stacking method, wiring layers can be formed with
high density to provide high density wiring patterns;
According to the thick film printing method, its application
covers a wide range because of its simplified
production process and good production yield.In the production of the ceramic multilayer
substrate, the interconnection of the respective
wiring layers is one of the critical techniques. For
the interconnection, in general, a via hole is formed
in an insulating layer and the via hole is filled with
a conductive material. These steps are referred to as
a via-fill process. In either of the green sheet
stacking method or the thick film printing method, when
the thickness of the insulating layer is small, the via
hole can be filled with a conductive material simultaneously
with the formation of a wiring pattern. However,
when the thickness of the insulating layer is
large, the via-fill process is needed before forming 
the wiring pattern.Conventionally, a conductive paste containing,
as its main components, a conductive material,
inorganic component powders, an organic binder, and a
solvent thereof is used for filling the via hole in the
via-fill process.EP-A-0 410 406 discloses a conductive paste including inorganic material powders containing
conductive powders and glass powders, an organic vehicle containing an organic binder and
an organic solvent, and a metal organic compound.The document teaches as an advantage thereof to avoid inorganic glass powders and it is
considered an advantage that the solids content of the composition as given is entirely
conductive metal.As shown in Figure 3, in the case where a via
hole 2 of a green sheet insulating layer 4 is filled
with a conductive paste 5, a solvent contained in the
conductive paste 5 penetrates into the green sheet
insulating layer 4 as well as evaporates therefrom; as
a result, inorganic component powders contained in the
conductive paste 5 move to an inner side of the via
hole 2. This phenomenon is called leveling. Because
of this leveling, a recess 3 is formed in the center of
the conductive paste 5. The
