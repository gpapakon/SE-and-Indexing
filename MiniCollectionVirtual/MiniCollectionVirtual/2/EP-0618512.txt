<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to developer compositions for use in development of 
electrostatic latent images and, more specifically, the present invention relates to carrier 
compositions for use in such developer compositions. The electrostatographic process, and particularly the xerographic process, is well 
known. This process involves the formation of an electrostatic latent image on a 
photoreceptor, followed by development, and subsequent transfer of the image to a suitable 
substrate. Numerous different types of xerographic imaging processes are known wherein, for 
example, insulative developer particles or conductive toner compositions are selected 
depending on the development systems used. Moreover, of importance with respect to the 
aforementioned developer compositions are the appropriate triboelectric charging values 
associated therewith as it is these values that enable continued constant developed images of 
high quality and excellent resolution. Additionally, carrier particles for use in the development of electrostatic latent 
images are described in many patents including, for example, U.S. Patent 3,590,000. These 
carrier particles may consist of various cores, including steel, with a coating thereover of 
fluoropolymers; and terpolymers of styrene, methacrylate, and silane compounds. Recent 
efforts have focused on the attainment of coatings for carrier particles for the purpose of 
improving development quality; and also to permit particles that can be recycled, and that do 
not adversely effect the imaging member in any substantial manner. Many of the present 
commercial coatings can deteriorate rapidly, especially when selected for a continuous 
xerographic process where the entire coating may separate from the carrier core in the form of 
chips or flakes, and fail upon impact, or abrasive contact with machine parts and other carrier 
particles. These flakes or chips, which cannot generally be reclaimed from the developer 
mixture, have an adverse effect on the triboelectric charging characteristics of the carrier 
particles thereby providing images with lower resolution in comparison to those compositions 
wherein the carrier coatings are retained on the surface of the core substrate. Further, another 
problem encountered with some prior art carrier coatings resides in fluctuating triboelectric 
charging characteristics, particularly with changes in relative humidity. The aforementioned 
modification in triboelectric charging characteristics provides developed images of lower 
quality
