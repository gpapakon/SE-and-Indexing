<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clear paint for a
golf ball, and a golf ball having high whiteness, the surface
of which is coated with the clear paint.The surface finish of a golf ball is normally
conducted by coating an opaque enamel paint on the surface
of the golf ball and then coating a clear paint thereon, or
coating the clear paint directly on the surface of the golf
ball.That is, by means of the surface finish, the
background color of the golf ball is opacified with the
enamel paint which also imparts desirable color tone
(normally, white color) to the golf ball. Further, any
mark printed on the enamel coating or the surface of the
golf ball is protected with the clear paint which also
imparts gloss to the golf ball, thereby providing a beautiful
appearance and durability to the golf ball.Further, in order to improve the whiteness of a golf
ball, a fluorescent brightener is formulated in the enamel
paint, in addition to white pigments such as titanium
dioxide, barium sulfate, etc. (e.g. Japanese Laid-Open 
Patent Publication No. 1-158976). US-4,865,326
relates to a clear coat for applying to the cover of a
golf ball. Furthermore, combinations of a fluorescent
brightener and a blue pigment are also formulated
(e.g. Japanese Laid-Open Utility Model Publication No.
61-168855).However, when a fluorescent brightener and blue
pigment are formulated in the enamel paint, in order
to attain sufficient effect quite large amount of them
have to be formulated. However, it is rather
difficult to formulate them in quite such large
amounts in the enamel paint, because a large amount of
a white pigment is already formulated impart strong
opacifying strength. Therefore, whiteness is not
sufficiently improved.On the other hand, in case of the clear paint,
only the fluorescent brightener is formulated even
when it is coated directly on the surface of the golf
ball (e.g. Japanese Laid-Open Utility Model
Publication No. 60-109647). The fluorescent
brightener and blue pigment are not formulated
together.The reason is considered to be as follows. That
is, when the blue pigment is formulated in the clear
paint, the clear paint can not maintain its
transparency and becomes turbid because the blue
pigment cannot dissolve in the solvent, thereby
spoiling the clear paint.Accordingly, high whiteness can not be obtained
for a golf ball coated only with a conventional clear
paint. Under these circumstances, in order to solve the problem
that high whiteness can not be obtained for a conventional
golf ball, the present
