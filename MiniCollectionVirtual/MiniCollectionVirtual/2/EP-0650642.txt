<DESCRIPTION>
 CERAMIC DEFLECTION DEVICEThe present invention relates to a ceramic deflection device and, in particular, to a method of producing and operating a monolithic ceramic deflection device and displacement sensor which does not employ a piezoelectric sensor.Ceramic bending devices utilizing the converse piezoelectric effect are well known in the art. This is the phenomenon by which an applied electric field generates a proportional shape change in such materials. Devices often take the form of so-called bimorphs and multimorphs. The operating principle is identical in both cases. Alternating layers of piezoelectric ceramic are poled, usually in antiparallel directions. The application of an electric field induces a transverse compressive strain in those layers having polar directions parallel to the field, due to the piezoelectric coefficient d_. of the piezoelectric ceramic material. Conversely, transverse tensile strain is induced in layers poled antiparallel to the applied field. The free end of the device is deflected by an amount determined by the magnitude of the applied field, d and various geometrical factors. The displacement is reversed on reversal of the field direction. It is- usual to apply the same electric field across all of the layers of the device. EP-A-0137148 describes such a piezoelectric bimorph constructed from piezoelectric ceramic layers which are poled. This device has the advantage of a monolithic sensor enabling feedback control. The piezoelectric sensor portion of the device operates without the application of an externally applied electric bias field. The device is made to bend by 

the application of an electric field to the remainder. This places a stress on the sensor portion, causing current to flow which can be related to the displacement of the element. GB-A-2006541 discloses a piezoelectric bimorph which has a pair of oppositely polarized piezoelectric elements bonded to a common substrate. A drive circuit applies a deflection voltage to each element in the same sense as the polarization of the element and thus avoids depolarization of the elements. The device does not include a displacement sensor.EP-A-0262637 discloses a piezoelectric bimorph device in which the piezoelectric ceramic layers are poled in the same direction and the application of an electric field across each layer causes bending. The device does not include a displacement sensor.Similar bending devices employing the electrostrictive effect are also known. Again, this is a field-induced shape change,
