<ABSTRACT>
A material which is hydrophilic in bulk, transparent, permeable to oxygen, based on a polymer containing two interpenetrating networks, including:     (1) a formed polydimethylsiloxane hydrophobic polymer matrix; and (2) a hydrophilic network of poly(acrylic acid) polymerised in the silicone matrix from a solution of acrylic acid containing a crosslinking agent.   The invention also relates to flexible objects which are hydrophilic in bulk, transparent, permeable to oxygen, in particular contact lenses, which are obtained directly from this material by hydration in water or an aqueous physiological saline solution.
