<ABSTRACT>
The identification system of the invention makes it possible to carry out a process of designation and interrogation of one target from among several others with high discriminating power and without stability problems in the aiming to be achieved. In order to do this, the invention includes means for carrying out a segmentation of the analysis field (CA) into elementary discriminating fields which are coded specifically in such a way as to mark the target to be interrogated in the elementary field which it occupies. The invention includes, in one embodiment example, an interrogator (I) equipped with a designation transmitter (21) coupled to an interrogation unit (22) via an analysis box (25) and a responder (R) situated on the friendly target and including a receiver (31) of coherent waves coupled to a response unit (32) via an analysis box (35). The transmitter (21) includes two laser diodes (Ds, Dg) placed at the focus of a lens (27) by interposition of a polarisation splitter cube (26), the laser diodes being mounted on two supports (28, 29) which are movable along two perpendicular directions (X, Y). The diodes emit a series of coded pulses for each elementary field created by coordinated movement of the movable supports (28, 29). Application to optical communications.
