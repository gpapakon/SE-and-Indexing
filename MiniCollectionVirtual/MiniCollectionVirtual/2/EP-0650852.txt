<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet
post-processing apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1. More specifically, it
relates to a sheet post-processing apparatus having a
function to process sheet material after the sheet
material such as copy paper or the like is discharged
from an image forming apparatus such as copying
machine, printing machine, or laser beam printer,
following an image formation operation, and is
sequentially sorted and deposited in a receiving tray
(hereinafter, "bin tray").In a conventional sheet post-processing
apparatus (hereinafter, "sorter") comprising a binding
apparatus (hereinafter, "stapler") which is disposed
so as to be enabled to move to or away from the bin,
the stapler is caused to invade into the bin region,
where the sheets sorted and deposited in the bins are
bound, bin after bin, by the stapler.In an apparatus (Figure 27) which binds the
sheets, at one of the corners, a stapler 700 is
disposed on the front side or the like location of the
bin B where the sheets are discharged by a discharge
roller 980 or the like, wherein the binding apparatus
is advanced into the bin space during the binding
operation to bind the sheets, at the corner. In the case of such a configuration, the
discharge roller 980, a sheet guiding member 981, or
the like are disposed so as to afford a gap 982, so
that they do not interfere with the aforementioned
stapler 700 during its advance.In an apparatus which binds the sheets, at
two points which are closer to the center portion of
the bin stopper side edge, or in an apparatus which
binds, at a single point which is near the rear edge,
a sheet discharging roller 800 and a sheet guiding
member 801 which discharge the sheets into the bin B
interfere with the stapler 700; therefore, an
additional bin Bc is provided in some apparatuses such
as those disclosed in the specification of the
JP-A-4 290,800, wherein
the bin Bc is different from the bin B and the sheets
are bound in this bin Bc in coordination with the
stapler 700 (Figure 28).However, in the case of the conventional
apparatus described hereinbefore, the bin interval
must be widened above the discharge bin Bb, above the
bin Bc in which the sheets are bound, and above the
bin Bd which is immediately below the bin Bc; in other
words, it is necessary to widen the bin interval at
three locations (Y) (in the case of the aforementioned
apparatus which binds the sheets at a single corner,
the bin interval must be widened at two locations 
since the bin in which the sheets are
