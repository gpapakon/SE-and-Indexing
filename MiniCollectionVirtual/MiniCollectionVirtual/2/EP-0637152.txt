<ABSTRACT>
Currently, the routing algorithms compute all the available paths in the network, 
from the source node to the destination node before to select the optimal 

route. No assumption is made on the network topology and the route computation 
is often time and resource consuming. Some paths which are calculated 

are not acceptable due to the particular geographical configuration of the network.
 

   In the real world, large transport networks are not fully meshed. The present 
invention is based on the observation that networks are usually built around 

a hierarchical structure. A set of nodes, interconnected by high throughput 
lines, are used to build a 'Backbone' (401) with a high degree of meshing to 

allow the redundancy and reliability required by the user. The other nodes or 
'local' nodes (404) are attached to one or several backbone nodes. It is the 

network designer responsibility, at the configuration time to define for each 
node what is its attribution : backbone (402) or local node (404). The list of the 

node attributions appears in the topology table (306) and is updated each time 
a node is added to or dropped from the network. The routing algorithm can 

take advantage of the particular network topology to drastically reduce the 
complexity of paths computation. For a given connection, only a limited number 

of nodes are eligible and are taken in account by the algorithm in the optimal 
route search. The object of the invention is to split the network in 

backbone and local nodes to speed up the path selection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high speed transmission system in a large 
packet switching network, more particularly, to an apparatus and method for 
speeding up the path selection between a source and a destination node and 
specially a method to decompose the network into backbone and local nodes. It has become increasingly useful to interconnect a plurality of data processing 
elements by means of a packet switching network in which data is transmitted 
as data assemblages called "packets". Such networks include a plurality of 
interconnected switching nodes which, in turn, are connected to end nodes 
supporting data processing equipments. Such packet networks can become 
quite large with an extensive geographical distribution. In such a situation, the 
selection of an efficient path between two end nodes which wish to communicate 
with each other becomes of paramount importance. Different methods are 
summarized by H. Nussbaumer in Teleinformatique II (pages 92 to 117) 
Presses Polytechniques Romandes 1987. The general problem which must be solved at the network level is to find a 
path between a source and a destination node. When the network is using 
datagrams, the path selection must be done individually for each packet. For 
virtual circuits, the path decision is done once only at the time of the circuit 
establishment. In both cases, the choice of a routing algorithm is not easy because 
it must satisfy a large number of often conflicting requirements. This 
algorithm must be simple to implement to not complicate the nodes realization,  
 
it must ensure a correct progress of the packets whatever the disturbance on 
the network. The algorithm must be able to provide satisfying results despite 
of the traffic variations and the network topology. It must also ensure the equity 
between the different end users and provide an equal distribution of the 
rights to access the network. At last, the routing algorithm must allow, when 
possible, to exploit the network in an optimal way, according to a criterion 
which can vary with the utilization type. In most of the cases, the network is 
realized in a way to minimize the packet transit time and to transfer the maximum 
number of packets. The principal objectives are respectively the reduction 
of the transit time and the increase of the throughput. In other cases, 
the objective is to decrease the communication cost, or to develop a reliable 
network able to operate correctly (without too sensible performance degradation) 
either in case of
