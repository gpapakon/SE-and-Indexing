<ABSTRACT>
A unit for an optical fiber screen is disclosed in 
which optical fibers (2) are bunched together at one end to 

form an input surface (5) of light, the other ends of the 
fibers are diffused on a panel (1) surface to form an exit 

surface of the light; the exit surface of the light is 
integrated with a resin layer (4) without the interposition 

of an air space, and the surface of the resin layer (4) is 
lenticulated. A process for producing the unit is also 

disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a unit for an 
optical fiber screen or display device in which light 
enters through one end of the optical fibers bunched 
tightly together and emanates from the other end of the 
optical fibers arranged on a panel surface at a pitch 
suitable to display image or character information with 
magnification. Further, the present invention relates to 
a process for producing the unit. Light illuminating type display devices, 
wherein optical fibers are used as light conductors to 
display images and character information, have advantages 
in that such large-size display devices as those not 
prepared by CRT (cathode-ray tube) can be constructed, 
maintenance and inspection of a large number of light 
emitting elements, which is a problem in large-sized 
display devices having light emitting elements disposed 
on a panel surface, is unnecessary, and display parts can 
be thinned since an end of light incidence can be 
disposed at any location through optical fibers. Thus, 
the development of such light illuminating type display 
devices is anticipated. In light illuminating type display devices, 
optical fibers are planted at an equal pitch on a panel 
surface, and several modifications are introduced at the 
end surfaces of light emanation so as to alleviate the 
sharp light directivity of the optical fibers, thereby 
widening the light emanating angle and viewing angle of a 
screen. For producing such devices, a method has been 
proposed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication  
 
No. 59-57274, Japanese Unexamined Utility Model 
Publication No. 59-114587, and Japanese Unexamined 
Utility Model Publication No. 60-19077 in which a panel 
is arranged on the light emanation surface of a screen, 
the panel has lenses formed on its surface, and the shape 
of the lenses corresponds to the pitch the of optical 
fibers. Further, numerous methods including the 
following have been proposed and applied to screens using 
optical fibers:
 
   A method disclosed in Japanese Unexamined 
Patent Publication No. 50-142198, in which transparent 
beads having a small diameter are arranged on the light 
emanation end surface of optical fibers;
 
   a method disclosed in Japanese Unexamined 
Utility Model Publication No. 2-19004 in which optical 
fibers are planted on a transparent resin sheet and a 
light diffusing layer is provided at the surface of the 
resin sheet; and
 
   a method in which a lens or a light diffuser is 
arranged on each of the light emanation end surfaces of 
optical

A unit for an optical fiber screen wherein 
optical fibers are bunched together at one end to form a 

part of light incidence and the other ends of the optical 
fibers are diffused on a panel surface to form a part of 

light emanation; characterized in that 
the other ends of the optical fibers are integrated with 

a resin layer without the interposition of an air space; 
the surface of the resin layer being formed into a 

lenticular shape. 
The unit for an optical fiber screen according 
to claim 1, wherein the pitch of the lenticules is 1/n 

(in which n is an integer) of the pitch at which the 
optical fibers forming the part of light emanation are 

placed in the panel. 
The unit for an optical fiber screen according 
to claim 1 or 2, wherein the lenticulated surface of the 

resin layer is formed into a saw-toothed shape at a 
prescribed angle, for each planting pitch of the optical 

fibers, in the direction of the planting of the optical 
fibers. 
A process for producing a unit for an 
optical fiber screen wherein optical fibers are bunched 

together at one end to form a part of light incidence and 
the other ends of the optical fibers are diffused on a 

panel surface to form a part of light emanation; 
characterized by filling a resinous liquid in a 

formwork, at the bottom of which a mold of lenticules is 
provided, burying end surfaces of the optical fibers 

placed in a panel surface in the resinous liquid, and 
then curing the resinous liquid so as to integrate with 

the end surfaces of the optical fibers without 
interposition of an air space. 
The process for producing the unit for an 
optical fiber screen according to claim 4, wherein the 

optical fibers are buried in the panel so that the end 
surfaces of the optical fibers protrude beyond the panel 

 
surface, arranging the end surfaces of the optical fibers 

in the formwork a prescribed distance from the bottom of 
the formwork, filling the resinous liquid in the 

formwork, and then curing the resinous liquid so as to
