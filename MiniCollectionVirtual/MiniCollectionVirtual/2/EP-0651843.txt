<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to the heat insulation of roofs and floors. In accordance with the invention the surface (1) is covered with a heat-insulating material (2), and supports (4) are placed on the said heat-insulating material (2). A monolithic, rigid and waterproof shell (7) is then placed, on the supports (4) so that an air-gap (3) is formed between the said heat-insulating material (2) and the said shell (7) and so that the said shell (7) may slide on the said supports (4). The ability of the finally constructed shell (7) to slide freely on the supports (4) actually protects the shell (7) from cracking due to overheating and overcooling. Further, according to the invention, the air-gap (3) communicates with the outer-space, a feature ensuring ventilation of the air-gap (3) and consequently preventing the development of moisture on the heat-insulating material.

<DESCRIPTION>
 HEAT INSULATION OF ROOFS AND FLOORSThis invention relates to the heat insulation of roof and floor surfaces. Further the surfaces insulated in accordance with the invention are waterproof and soundproof. As an example of floor surfaces, reference is made to interior floors, building terraces, quays etc. As far as roof elements are concerned, reference is made for instance to horizontal and inclined roofs, domes etc.In treating the issue of waterproofing and heat insulation of horizontal surfaces, the state of the art refers to various methods, which are mainly based on the use of membranes made of all kinds of asphaltic or other synthetic material available by the chemical industry, such as PVC, polyurethane's, polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, acrylics and others. Such membranes, which either are applied in liquid form or they are ready sheets, are used for waterproofing of the external horizontal surfaces of buildings and ensure protection from internal or external wetting of the heat insulation layers. The main disadvantages that such material present, are i) the limited life-time of their properties, because of their exposure to a high- temperature environment and/or ultra-violet radiation, and ii) that they may be easily perforated. There is also a risk of having defective joints, when adjacent membrane elements, are joint together. The use of such membranes is further involved with a relatively high cost.The water, which accumulates on such surfaces, is guided towards drainage openings configured around the perimeter of the surface, whereby the water flow is achieved through an appropriate inclination configured thereon. The inclination is obtained through application of various materials of considerable thickness such as light concrete, pumice-stone, gas-concrete etc., or through the covering of the surface by plates whose upper surface is inclined in their final position. This process is costly and results in loading the surfaces to be insulated, with additional weights.When the surfaces are intended to be passable and/or to carry heavy loads, they are usually covered with a concrete layer (see for example figure 2 of document US-A-4,674,249). The problem which in such cases arises is the development of cracks, as a result of thermal loading. In order to minimise this problem expansion joints are formed, which are usually 

sealed with appropriate organic materials of synthetic base, having a limited life-time, which calls for due inspection and maintenance works on a regular basis.To
