<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an ignition system, comprising an 
exciter circuit having chargeable energy storage capacitance 
means; a plurality of igniters; a plurality of triggerable gated 
switches, the capacitance means being connected to each igniter 
by at least one respective gated switch; and control means for 
controlling the triggering of the gated switches to providing a 
respective discharge path for discharging the capacitance means 
through the respective igniter to produce an igniter spark. Such an ignition system is known from EP-A-0 026 429. In this 
known system, individual capacitances are connected to respective 
spark plugs in an internal combustion engine through respective 
triggerable switches. The control means triggers the switches 
in sequence. However, such a system simply operates to cause 
each capacitance to discharge through the respective spark plug. 
Such a system is also known from US-A-3 874 349. In both these 
known systems, no means of individually controlling one or more 
parameters of the spark is provided. The invention aims to deal 
with this problem.  
 EP-A-0 369 236 discloses an ignition system for a gas turbine 
engine having a single discharge path operated by a timing 
circuit which can control the time of occurrence of the sparks 
from a capacitor to only a single plug through a single pulse 
shaping circuit. FR-A-1 157 871 discloses another ignition system for a gas 
turbine engine. This system uses switches comprising gated gas 
discharge tubes. However, no means is shown for controlling 
parameters of the spark. According to the invention, the known ignition system as described in the opening paragraph is 
characterised according to claim 1 in that the control means comprises triggering 
means connected to trigger the gated switches to produce an 
individually selectable spark rate for each igniter. Further according to the invention, the known ignition system as described in the opening paragraph is 
characterised according to claim 6 in that the control means comprises energy level 
responsive means for triggering the gated switches to produce 
individually selectable amounts of energy discharged through each 
igniter by the capacitance means. The dependent claims describe particular embodiments of the 
invention. Ignition systems embodying the invention will now be described,  
 
by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying 
diagrammatic drawings in which:
