<ABSTRACT>
An assembly incorporates an inclined, fluid-permeable and rotating sepn. surface (1). The side receiving fluid has an open face (5) and a closed face (4) on the outflow side. A worm conveyor (19) is arranged parallel to the sepn. face (1) and leads to a discharge point for the sepd. prods. collected through a funnel (23). The assembly has a housing (18), drive shaft (21) and conveyor reverser (22). A sepn. unit is positioned above the collecting funnel (23). The improvement is that the worm drive (19) sepn. unit axis (20) is positioned above and at a distance from the axis of the surrounding rotating sepn. surface (1), from which it is transposed in parallel.
