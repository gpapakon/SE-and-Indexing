container(13), and a coupling member (18, 19)

provided on one of or both of the ink container (11)
and the waste ink container (13) and provided for

coupling the ink container (11) and the waste ink
container (13), and forming an ink guide path (46)

for guiding the ink flown from the atmosphere
communication hole (36) to a predetermined position

of the ink container (11) or the waste ink container
(13). An elastic body (16) has a domed shape, and is

used at a coupling portion (20A, 20B, 20C) in one of
or both of the ink container (11) and the waste ink

container (13), the coupling portion (20A, 20B, 20C)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an exchangeable type
ink tank to be employed in an ink-jet printing apparatus
and, in particular, to an ink tank for storing an ink to be
used in a printing apparatus according to the preamble of
claim 1 and to an ink-jet recording apparatus comprising a
mounting portion on which this ink tank is mounted.As one example of the conventional exchangeable ink
tank, an ink cartridge in a form illustrated in Figs. 1 and
2 has been known in the art. Fig. 1 is an illustration
showing a detail of the ink
cartridge, and showing side elevation in section. Fig. 2 is
a section showing a major part, such as an ink coupling
portion of the ink cartridge or so forth.As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, an ink cartridge 10
includes an ink storage chamber 1 and a waste ink storage
chamber 2. At the end of the ink storage chamber 1, rubber
plugs 4 for piercing ink supply needle (not shown) at an
ink-jet head side therethrough, are provided at two
portions.
Similarly, another rubber plug 4 is provided at the end
portion of the waste ink storage chamber 2 at one portion.
These rubber plugs 4 form a part of the ink coupling
portion. Except for an ink communication 
portion 3 where the ink supply needle pierces, the
rubber plug 4 is clamped by a housing 5 of the ink
cartridge, an ink absorbing body 6 and a rubber plug
retainer 7. With this construction, when the ink
cartridge is removed from a printer, the ink stuck to
the ink supply needle drawn from the cartridge
associated with removable of the ink cartridge can be
removed by the ink absorbing body 6. Thus,
contamination of the inside of the printer by the ink
stuck to the supply needle or plugging of the supply
needle per se can be successfully prevented.The waste ink storage chamber 2 is formed with
two layer of storage portions mutually communicated
at one ends. In the waste ink storage chamber 2,
the portion where the ink supply needle pierces is
located corresponding to the position corresponding
to the lower layer storage portion. Namely, in the
waste ink storage chamber 2, the supply needle
connected to an ink supply passage of an ink-jet
printing apparatus, passes through so that the waste
ink discharged by the ejection recovery process and
so forth may flow into the lower layer storage
portion. Absorbing body 8 is filled in substantially
whole waste ink storage chamber 2 so that the waste
ink flowing into the lower layer storage portion can
be absorbed by the absorbing body 8 in the lower
layer storage portion. According to flow of the
waste
