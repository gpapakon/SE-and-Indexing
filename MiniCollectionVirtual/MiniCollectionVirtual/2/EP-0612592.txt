<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to pivoted tools 
such as scissors, pliers, pruners, and the like. More 

particularly, this invention is concerned with tools having 
a force applying end with formed handles, and opposed 

working ends disposed across a pivotable joint. In these 
tools the pivotable joint, which is formed concurrently with 

the handles, is an integral part of one of the handles. 
This invention is also concerned with the method of 

producing these tools.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, generally, to pivoted tools 
such as scissors, pliers, shears, pruners and the like. More 
particularly, this invention is concerned with tools having a 
force-applying end with formed handles, and opposed working 
ends disposed across a pivotable joint, through which a force 
may be transmitted to the working surfaces of the working 
ends. In these tools, the pivotable joint, which is formed 
concurrently with the handles, is an integral part of one of 
the handles. Although it will become apparent from the 
following description that certain features of the present 
invention may be utilized in pivoted tools of various 
construction for application to specific uses, for ease of 
understanding and convenience, the following description will 
from time to time specifically refer to a pair of scissors as 
the most preferred implementation of the present invention.  
 Pivoted implements having elongated members 
disposed for cooperative engagement about a pivotable joint 
are widely used by those desiring to transmit a force 
through the pivotable joint to a working piece engaged by 
the working surfaces of the implement. In particular, 
pivoted tools such as scissors generally comprise two 
elongated members, typically made of stamped or forged metal 
or other suitable material, disposed for cooperative 
engagement about a pivotable joint. To facilitate operation 
of the implement by the user, handles conforming to the 
fingers or hands of the user are preferably molded onto the 
force applying end of each elongated member, or in the case 
of anvil-type implements, the entire elongated member is 
typically made of molded material. Conventional molding operations used to form the 
handles onto the force applying ends consist of positioning 
one elongated member in a suitable space in a die casting 
mold wherein the member is fixed in position with respect to 
the mold. A pin or the like going through the pivot point 
aperture in the member secures the member with respect to 
the mold. As described in U.S. Patent No. 4,715,122 to one 
of the present inventors, the space receiving the elongated 
member communicates with a mold cavity for the handle 
portion. The cavity is subsequently filled with a fluid 
plastic material or the like, whereby the plastic material 
partially surrounds the force applying end (also called tang 
portion) of the elongated member so that the handle is 
molded onto the tang. The same operation is separately 
repeated to form the handle on the other
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A tool having a force applying end and an opposed 
working end disposed across a pivotable joint through which a 

force may be transmitted, wherein the tool includes first and 
second elongated members (12,14) having first and second 

handles (30,32) moulded into engagement with a respective one 
of the elongated members (12,14) at the force applying end 

(20,22) thereof, the members being disposed for cooperative 
engagement about the pivotable joint (24) and further wherein 

the joint is comprised of: 

(a) first and second registering apertures (17,19), one of 
each formed in a respective one of the elongated members 

(12,14); and 
(b) a pivot member integrally moulded with the first handle 
(32), the pivot member having an integrally moulded shank (40) projecting from the 

first handle through the first and second apertures (17,19) 
into engagement with the interior surfaces (42,44) thereof; 

characterized in that the shank (40) terminates in a head (48) 
lying adjacent and effectively in contact with the outer 

surface (46) of the second elongated member (14), the head 
(48) being moulded integrally with the shank (40). 
The tool of claim 1, characterized in that the head 
(48) has a diameter substantially exceeding the diameter of 

the aperture (17) in the second member (14). 
The tool of claim 1, characterized in that the pivot 
member is joined to the handle (32) by a tongue (36) lying 

adjacent and effectively in contact with the outer surface 
(38) of the first elongated member (12). 
A method of manufacturing a tool having first and 
second elongated members operable across a pivotable joint, 

each member (12,14) having oppositely facing inner (54,56) and 
outer (38,46) surfaces; each member comprising a working end  

 
(16,18), a force applying end (20,22) at the distal end 

thereof, and a handle (30,32) moulded into engagement with the 
elongated member at the force applying end thereof; the 

pivotable joint (24) comprising first and second registering 
apertures (17,19), one of each formed in a respective of one 

of the elongated members (12,14), a pivot member joined to the 
first of the handles (32) by a tongue (36), the pivot member 

having a shank (40) projecting from the tongue (36) into the 
apertures (17,19), characterized by the steps of: 


terminating the shank in a head (48) lying adjacent and 
effectively in contact with the outer surface (48) of the 

second of said elongated members (14), 
disposing the pair of elongated members (12,14) in a 
mould having first and second cavities adapted to receive the 

members with the inner surface (54) of one of the members 
adjacent to the inner surface (56) of the other of the 

members, the apertures (17,19) being in substantial 
registration with a third cavity conforming with the shape of 

the head (48), the third cavity communicating with the 
apertures and with the handle area of the first cavity; and 
injecting a moulding material into the third cavity and 
into selected areas of the first and second cavities to form 

in a common moulding operation the pivot member and said 
handles (30,32). 
The method of claim 4, characterized by exerting a 
force along the longitudinal axis of the pivot member on the 

outer surface of the tongue (36) and toward the pivot member 
while retracting selected areas of the third cavity to permit 

longitudinal displacement of the pivot member and thereby 
impart desired clearance between the head (48) and the outer 

surface (46) of the second member (14) for functional 
operation of said pivoted tool.
