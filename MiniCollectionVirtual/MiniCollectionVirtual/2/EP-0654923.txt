<ABSTRACT>
The possibility of passing off apparent "good" higher level digital
signals that may include corrupted or failed lower level digital signals because of

inter-ring grooming of the lower level digital signals from one path-switched ring to
another path-switched ring employing at least a first shared node and a second shared

node is minimized by dual feeding communications circuits from one path-switched
ring to the other via the shared nodes and by provisioning at least one inter-ring

groomed communications circuit from a secondary ring node of one of the shared
nodes (secondary communications circuit) of a particular ring to be supplied to a

primary ring node in the other shared node of the same ring. The at least one
secondary communications circuit is obtained in the primary ring node and

demultiplexed so that the lower level digital signals in the at least one
communications circuit can be evaluated on a one-to-one pairwise basis with

corresponding lower level digital signals in the corresponding at least one
communications circuit (primary communications circuit) being supplied from the

inter-ring grooming apparatus associated with the primary ring node. The "best"
of the lower level signals in each are selected and combined into a "new" primary

communications circuit which is dual fed in the primary ring node in one direction to
its termination ring node and in the other direction through the secondary ring node

to the termination ring node. A selector in the secondary ring
node is revertively biased to normally select the "new" primary communications

circuit to be supplied to the termination ring node. However, in the case of a
primary communication circuit failure because of an interconnect or other failure in

the primary ring node, the selector will then select the secondary communication
circuit to be supplied to the termination ring node for the primary ring node. The

provisioning of the primary ring node and the secondary ring is such that the
demultiplexing to obtain the lower level digital signals, their evaluation and

selection, and multiplexing only need to be done in the primary ring node and not in
both.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ring transmission systems and, more particularly, to interworking between path-switched ring transmission systems.It has become increasingly important to maintain communications connectivity in the presence of transmission system failures. To this end, ring interworking arrangements have been proposed in e.g. US 5218604, for transporting communications circuits between path-switched rings. Ring interworking is essentially a dual feed of communications circuits from a first ring to a second ring. The dual feeding takes place across two different sites, each with ring nodes for both the first and second rings, in order to provide the physical diversity necessary to enable the cross-ring communications circuits to survive a failure of one of the two shared sites. The second ring performs a receive switch based on some parameter or set of parameters of the two signals being fed from the first ring. For the other direction of the same end-to-end cross-ring communications circuits, the second ring dual feeds communications circuits to the first ring. The first ring performs a receive switch of the two signals being fed from the second ring.A problem arises when there is a need to groom the inter-ring communications traffic by way of intervening wide-band digital cross-connect systems (DCS), multiplexers (MUX) or the like, where the grooming is being done at a different digital signal level, i.e., bit rate, than is being used in the rings. Examples are DS 1 digital signals in DS3 signals and VT SONET signals in STS-1 5 SONET signals. In such arrangements, if a failure occurs incoming to the DCS, MUX or other grooming apparatus from one ring, it will not be recognized by the other ring because the inter-ring grooming apparatus will only insert the DS 1 or VT failure indication and not the DS3 or STS-1 failure indication. Consequently, the inter-ring groomed signals, i.e., DS3s or STS-ls, passed off to either ring could 0 appear to be "good" but could, in fact, contain corrupted or failed lower level digital signals, i.e., DS1s s or VTs.One attempt at avoiding the problems associated with inter-ring grooming of lower level digital signals in the higher level digital signals employed in interworking path-switched rings is described in a contribution to T1 Standards Project T1X1.2 entitled "SWB Ring Interconnection Architecture Issues and Proposed Interim Solutions", T1X1.2/93-013, dated March 1, 1993. The path-switched ring solution proposed in the noted Contribution T1X1.2/93-013 is an
