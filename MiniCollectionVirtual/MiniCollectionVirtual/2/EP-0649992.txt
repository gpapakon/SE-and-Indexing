<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a disc brake actuator. Upon actuation in a known actuator, direct engagement takes place between the brake anchor plate and the brake-lining carrier and the braking force gives rise to a considerable pressure per unit area in the area of contact. If the brake-lining carrier moves in the direction of application or in the opposite direction in this state, wear can occur on the brake-lining carrier and the brake anchor plate, giving rise to faults in operation. To increase operating reliability, the invention proposes in one embodiment, the arrangement of one or more rolling elements (3 and 10 respectively) between the brake-lining carrier (7) and the brake anchor plate (6) and, in another embodiment, the arrangement of elastic means between the brake-lining carrier (7) and the support, the elastic means transmitting supporting forces but, at the same time, by elastic deformation, permitting movement in the direction of application and in the opposite direction. The preferred area of application of the invention is in vehicle brake systems.

stroke towards the brake disc (1), and having at least 

one circumferentially acting supporting element (2, 11)

member on the brake carrier (6) for absorbing the 
forces resulting from the braking moments,

element (2, 11) there is arranged at least one rolling-contact 
element (3, 10),
