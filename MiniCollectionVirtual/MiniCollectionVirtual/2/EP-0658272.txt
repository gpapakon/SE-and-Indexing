<ABSTRACT>
An encapsulated bobbin-mounted coil (10, 30) is associated with a stator (36) wherein the stator, in cooperation with other parts of a mold (54, 66), define a mold cavity. Encapsulating material (76) is injected through gates (72) in one of the other mold parts into the defined mold cavity to encapsulate the coil and bobbin in their entirety, including attachments of the finish lead ends of the coil wire to bobbin-mounted electrical terminals (14, 16) that extend axially away from the bobbin and coil, except for distal end portions of the terminals. The process simultaneously joins the encapsulated coil and bobbin with the stator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to solenoids and methods of making 
solenoids. From commonly assigned U.S. patent 5,065,128, it is known to 
injection-mold encapsulating material around an electromagnetic coil, 
thereby creating an encapsulated coil, and then to use the encapsulated 
coil in the solenoid of a solenoid-actuated valve, such as in U.S. patents 
5,083,747 and 5,102,095, also commonly assigned. From pending, commonly assigned WO 
92/09093, it is known to support an electromagnetic coil on a holder that 
contains electrical terminals to which terminations of the coil have been 
attached, to injection-mold encapsulating material around the coil and 
holder except for distal end portions of the electrical terminals, thereby 
creating an encapsulated coil, and then to use the encapsulated coil in a 
solenoid. When an electromagnetic coil is used in a solenoid-actuated valve, it 
is typically associated with a stator. Often epoxy is employed to join the 
two together by adhesive bonding, a process that may be relatively costly, 
messy, and time-consuming, and occasionally ineffective in achieving a 
desired degree of bonding. An encapsulated coil may be associated with a stator by inserting 
one into the other, in which case dimensional control of the encapsulation 
must be carefully practiced in order to assure that proper insertion will be 
attained.  
 From US 3,045,290, it is known to encapsulate the entirety of 
a bobbin and a coil that is mounted on the bobbin, including 
encapsulating proximal end portions of terminals mounted on the 
bobbin and connections of the coil to the terminals. A magnetic core 
(stator) may be inserted through the center of the encapsulated 
assembly, but after the encapsulation step. JP 60211814 discloses a transformer having a core, but the 
core is completely inserted within the molding cavity so that it forms 
no part of the molding cavity. The present invention relates to a new and improved means and 
method for associating an encapsulated electromagnetic coil with a stator.  
 Briefly, and in a general way, the invention comprises disposing an 
unencapsulated bobbin-mounted coil in association with a stator wherein 
the stator, in cooperation with other parts of a mold, define a mold cavity, 
and then injecting encapsulating material through gates in one or more of 
such other mold parts into the mold cavity to simultaneously encapsulate 
the coil and bobbin in their entirety, including attachments of the finish 
lead ends of the coil wire to bobbin-mounted

A method of making a solenoid coil assembly comprising 
a bobbin (12), a pair of electrical terminals (14,16) having proximal 

end portions mounted on said bobbin and distal end portions providing 
for connection with a separable electrical connector, a length of wire 

disposed as a solenoid coil (30) on said bobbin and having opposite 
ends attached with said electrical terminals to electrically place the 

coil across said terminals, a stator (36) comprising an inner tube (38) 
disposed with in said bobbin and an outer tube (40) 

disposed outside said bobbin, and an encapsulant (76) 
encapsulating the entirety of said coil and bobbin, including the 

mounting of said terminals' proximal end portions on said bobbin and 
the attachment of said wire with said terminals, and joining with said 

stator so that said bobbin, coil, terminals, and stator form a unitary 
solenoid coil assembly, said method comprising fabricating said 

bobbin and terminals as a sub-assembly, placing said sub-assembly 
and said stator in a mold that has first (54) and second (66) mold 

parts that coact with said stator (36), as a third mold part, to define a 
mold cavity (48) such that said terminals project axially from one end,

fabricate said encapsulant and thereby create the unitary solenoid coil 

assembly, wherein said mold cavity (48) defined 
by said first, second and third mold part comprises a cylindrical space between a 

radially outer wall surface of said inner tube (38) and a radially inner wall 
surface of said outer tube (40), said bobbin (12) and coil (30) are disposed radially 

spaced from said radially outer wall surface of said inner tube (38) and
