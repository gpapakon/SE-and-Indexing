<ABSTRACT>
In order to immobilise the output shaft (6) at the end of the downward closure travel, the hollow wheel (5) is made to mesh with two gear mechanisms (7) which have very slightly different numbers of teeth from each other. Each gear mechanism (7) is provided with an irregularly shaped boss (7a) and the arrival in register with the said bosses operates a fork (8) whose teeth (8a) engage with stops (4) which are integral with the worm (3) which is thus immobilised.

<CLAIMS>
Winch for the operation of blinds, rolling shutters and other closure 
devices, comprising a deformable apron (S) suitable for rolling on a drum 

(T) integral with the output shaft (6) of the winch, said winch 
incorporating, in addition to a reducing system formed by a driving 

member (3) and a driven member (5), a track limiter suitable for 
preventing the continued rotation of the output shaft when the apron 

reaches the bottom end of its track, the limiter comprising two cogs (7) 
which, while having numbers of teeth which differ very slightly from each 

other, are in contact with the driven member (5), characterised in that the 
two cogs (7) are integral with a lateral boss (7
a
) with an irregular profile, 
and in that the limiter comprises a slide (8) which is resiliently applied 

against the two aforementioned lateral bosses (7
a
), whilst its free end (8
a
) 
is suitable, when the profiles of the bosses happen to coincide so as to 

define a single boss of reduced width, for co-operating with at least one 
stop (4) integral with the driving member (3) which is thereby rotationally 

immobilised. 
Winch according to claim 1, characterised in that the slide is 
constituted by a fork (8), the two branches of which surround the driven 

member (5) and the cogs (7), whilst its central portion or base co-operates 
with the bosses (7
a
) of the cogs (7) by means of a spring (9). 
Winch according to claim 2, characterised in that the ends (8
a
) of 
the branches of the fork (8) are disposed facing two grooves (3
a
) provided  
 

laterally in the driving member (3), the stops of said driving member being 
constituted by a pin secured in each of said grooves. 
Winch according to any of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that each lateral boss (7
a
) has a general cylindrical profile and is cut to 
leave a flat part (7
b
) suitable for giving it an irregular profile.
