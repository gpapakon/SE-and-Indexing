<ABSTRACT>
Isocyanate-based foams are produced by reacting     1) polyisocyanates with 2) compounds having a molecular weight of from 400 to 10,000 which contain at least two hydrogen atoms which are active towards isocyanates, in the presence of 3) hydrocarbons which can be evaporated under the foaming conditions as blowing agent, optionally in the presence of 4) compounds containing at least two hydrogen atoms which are reactive towards isocyanates and have a molecular weight of from 32 to 399, and optionally in the presence of 5) further blowing agents and auxiliaries and additives known per se,   where component 2) comprises mixtures of a) nitrogen-free polyethers containing at least two hydrogen atoms which are active towards isocyanates and contain oxyethylene radicals and b) polyethers containing at least two hydrogen atoms which are reactive towards isocyanates and containing no oxyethylene groups.

A process for producing isocyanate foams by the
reaction of


1) polyisocyanates with
2) compounds having at least two hydrogen atoms

active towards isocyanates and a molecular weight
of from 400 to 10,000 in the presence of
3) hydrocarbons which are vaporisable under the
foaming conditions as blowing agents and

optionally in the presence of
4) compounds having at least two hydrogen atoms
capable of reacting with isocyanates and a

molecular weight of from 32 to 399, as well as
optionally in the presence of
5) additional blowing agents and known per se
auxiliary materials and additives,

characterised in that mixtures of a) nitrogen-free
polyethers having at least two hydrogen atoms active

towards isocyanates and which contain oxyethylene
groups, and b) polyethers having at least two hydrogen

atoms active towards isocyanates and which are free
from oxyethylene groups are used as component 2), the

polyether component 2a) having a functionality of at
most 4 and the polyether component 2b) having a

functionality of at least 4, in which mixtures the
hydrocarbon used as a blowing agent is partly

dissolved and partly dispersed, so that an emulsion is
formed. 
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that

 hydrocarbons are used as blowing agents.
A process according to claims 1 and 2, characterised
in that n- and/or i-pentane and/or cyclopentane are

used as blowing agents.
A process according to claims 1 and 2, characterised
in that mixtures of cycloalkanes and linear or

branched alkanes are used as blowing agents.
A process according to claims 1 to 4, characterised in
that 0.5 to 3.5 wt.% and preferably 1 to 2.5 wt.%

water, based on component 2), is used as a concomitant
blowing agent.
A process according to claims 1 to 5, characterised in
that in a preliminary reaction the polyether component

2a) is reacted with excess polyisocyanate to produce a
prepolymer containing isocyanate groups, which

prepolymer is then reacted with the remaining
components, with formation of the foam.
A process according to claims 1 to 6, characterised in
that the polyether component 2a) is a polyether

obtained using a trimethylolpropane and/or glycerol
starter and the polyether component 2b) is a polyether

obtained using a sucrose and/or sorbitol starter.
A process according to claims 1 to 7, characterised in
that 5 to 40 wt.% and preferably 10 to 20 wt.% of a

polyester having at least two hydrogen atoms active
towards isocyanates is added to the polyether mixture

2). 
A process according to claims 1 to 8, characterised in
that a polyester of phthalic acid and/or terephthalic

acid having an OH number of 100 to 500, preferably 200
to 400, is used as polyester.
