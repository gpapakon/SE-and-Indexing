<ABSTRACT>
In an ebullated bed process the feedstock 
conduit is provided with at least 50 psi (4.4 atm) head 

in excess of a liquid-vapor separation pressure. The 
excess head is used in combination with an eductor to 

recycle a reactor effluent liquid. The expanded catalyst 
bed is thereby maintained at 110 vol% to 200 vol% of a 

settled catalyst volume. A separate pump to expand 
(ebullate) the catalyst bed is not required.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an ebullated bed 
process for the liquid phase hydrotreating of a 
hydrocarbon feedstock. The invention also relates to a 
recycle system with a liquid/liquid eductor for 
ebullating a catalyst bed. The ebullated bed process comprises the passing 
of concurrently flowing streams of liquids or slurries of 
liquids and solids and gas upwardly through a vertically 
elongated cylindrical vessel containing a catalyst bed. 
The catalyst in the bed is maintained in random motion in 
the liquid and has a gross volume dispersed through the 
liquid greater than the volume of the catalyst when 
stationary. This technology has been used commercially 
in the upgrading of heavy liquid hydrocarbons or 
converting coal to synthetic oils. The process is generally described in U. S. Re 
25,770 to Johanson. A 
mixture of hydrocarbon liquid and hydrogen is passed 
upwardly through a bed of catalyst particles at a rate 
such that the particles are forced into random motion as  
 
the liquid and gas flow upwardly through the bed. The 
random catalyst motion is controlled by recycle liquid 
flow so that at steady state, the bulk of the catalyst 
does not rise above a definable level in the reactor. 
Vapors along with the liquid which is being hydrogenated 
are removed at the upper portion of the reactor. In an ebullated bed process the substantial 
amounts of hydrogen gas and light hydrocarbon vapors rise 
through the reaction zone into the catalyst free zone. 
Liquid from the catalyst free zone is both recycled to 
the bottom of the reactor to ebullate the catalyst bed 
and removed from the reactor as product. Vapor is 
separated from the liquid recycle stream before being 
passed through the recycle conduit to the recycle pump 
suction. The recycle pump (ebullation pump) maintains 
the expansion (ebullation) and random motion of catalyst 
particles at a constant and stable level by recycling 
liquid to the bottom of the reactor. The recycle pump 
for this service has a high suction pressure but a head 
of only 68.9 KPa - 689.5 KPa (10 to 100 psi), typically 
344.8 KPa (50 psi). Such pumps are commercially 
available and command a premium price. Because of the 
high suction pressure service, the support facilities for 
these pumps, e.g., high pressure seal oil system and 
variable speed drive system require frequent and 
expensive maintenance.  
 Reactors employed in a catalytic hydrogenation 
process with an ebullated bed of catalyst particles are 
designed with a central vertical recycle conduit

through a feedstock conduit (22,22') at a feedstock rate to a 
lower portion (42,42') of a reactor vessel, and upwardly 

through an expanded catalyst bed (44,44') to an upper portion
