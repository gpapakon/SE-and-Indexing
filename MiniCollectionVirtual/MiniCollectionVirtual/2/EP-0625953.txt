<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is a mass discharger operating from above and intended for a space such as a silo (1), which includes a scraper conveyor (4) jointed next to the edge of the side (1.2) of the discharge end of the silo (1), essentially the length of the silo (1) and extending over the edge. This consisting of an endless conveyor chain (17) and scrapers (4.1) attached to it, and that the scraper (4) includes a second joint (5) adjusted in such a way that in connection with the first-mentioned joint (3) the scraper conveyor rests against the side (1.2) and bottom (1.1) of the silo (1) while it is emptying it. The discharger includes lifting devices (10, 11) for raising the scraper conveyor (4) to the upper position (K) for the filling of the silo.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A MASS DISCHARGER FOR A SPACE SUCH AS A SILO, INCLUDING A JOINTED CONVEYOR OPERATING FROM ABOVEThe object of the invention is a discharger for peat or oth mass operating from above and intended for a space like a sil which includes a transfer member that moves the mass from t surface of the mass to outside the silo.Peat is known to be a material that is difficult to store. easily tends to arch onto the sides of the silo, so that di charge devices on the bottom of the silo only form a holl inside the peat mass. In winter in particular arching is a ve great problem, which attempts have been made to overcome means of heating and vibration.There are also known discharge devices operating from abov which may consist of, for example, a screw conveyor installed the middle of a high cylindrical storage tank. In this case to however, there is a danger of arching as the screw eats a holl in the middle of the mass. For a low silo in particular, the is nothing else available than dischargers that operate fr below.The intention of this invention is to create a new kind discharger that operates from above, which does not have t drawbacks mentioned above and which therefore operates reliab in winter too. The characteristic features of a discharger accordance with the invention are presented in the accompanyi Patent Claims. A discharger in accordance with the inventi operates so reliably that it can also be used as a batcher. T size of the batch can then be controlled by means of the spe of rotation of the scraper conveyor. With the aid of a di charger in accordance with the invention it is also possible fill a low silo up to the brim, as the rotating scraper convey levels the mass deposited in the silo.In what follows the invention is illustrated by reference to t accompanying figures, which show one discharger in accordan with the invention in connection with a sludge treatment uni 

Figure 1 shows a cross-section of a silo equipped with a discharger in accordance with the invention. Figures 2a and 2b show side and top views of a separate scraper conveyor. Figure 3 shows the installation of a silo in accordance with the invention in connection with a sludge treatment unit.Here the silo 1 is constructed on a casette base 2. The side 1.2 of the discharge end and the base 1.1 of the silo are marked separately. The top of the silo 1 includes a cover construction 7, in which there is a feed opening and sides 9 running round it. A disk screen 8 is arranged inside the silo, next to the opening. A scraper conveyor 4, which

PATENT CLAIMS
1. A mass discharger operating from above and intended for space such as a silo (1) , which includes a transfer device fo moving the mass from the surface of the mass to outside th silo, together with its operating devices and supporting struc¬ tures (1, 7, 14) that carry it characterized in that the trans¬ fer device is formed by a scraper conveyor (4) jointed next t the edge of the side (1.2) of the discharge end of the silo (1) , essentially the length of the silo (1) and extending over th edge, and consisting of an endless conveyor chain (17) an scrapers (4.1) attached to it, and that the scraper conveyor (4) includes a second joint (5) adjusted in such a way that i connection with the first-mentioned joint (3) the scraper con- veyor rests against the side (1.2) and bottom (1.1) of the silo (1) while it is emptying it, and the discharger includes liftin devices (10, 11) for raising the scraper conveyor (4) to the upper position (K) for the filling of the silo.
2. A discharger in accordance with Patent Claim 1, charac terized in that the scraper conveyor (4) includes longitudinal frame components (18, 19), of which the first frame componen (18) is jointed by the aforesaid first joint (3) near to th edge of the silo (1) and the second frame component (19) is jointed to this first frame component (18) by the aforesai second joint (5) .
3. A discharger in accordance with Patent Claim 2, charac terized in that the first joint (5) consists of the first axl (23) with its bearings, by means of which this axle is carrie in the aforesaid support structures (1, 7, 14) and which axl (23) is linked by means of bearings to the first frame componen (18) , and that the drive motor (22) which forms the operatin device is arranged to rotate this axle (23) and that guid wheels (15) driving the chains (17) of the scraper conveyor (4) are placed on the axle (23) . 


4. A discharger in accordance with Patent Claim 2, charac terized in that the second joint (5) consists of an axle (24) which is placed through the ends of both frame components (18 19) permitting them to twist mutually, and that the axle in eludes an auxilliary wheel (20) supporting the chain (17) of th scraper conveyor (4) .
5. A discharger in accordance with one of Patent Claims 2 4, characterized in that the discharger includes a guide whee (6) located above the scraper conveyor (4) in the area of th second joint (5) joint (5) to turn the conveyor chain (17) whe the scraper conveyor (4) bends at the second joint (5) .
