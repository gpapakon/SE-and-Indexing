<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing chlorine dioxide. The method comprises reacting chloric acid with hydrogen peroxide as a reducing agent.Chlorine dioxide used in aqueous solution is of considerable commercial interest, mainly in pulp bleaching, but also in water purification, fat bleaching, removal of phenols from industrial wastes etc. It is therefore desirable to provide processes in which chlorine dioxide can be efficiently produced.There are numerous different processes for chlorine dioxide production. Most processes in commercial use involves reaction of sodium chlorate in an acidic medium with a reducing agent such as chloride ions, methanol or sulfur dioxide. The acidity is generally provided by sulfuric acid. A drawback of the known processes is the formation of some form of sodium sulfate as a by-product which has to be removed from the reactor, either in the form of a solid saltcake or as waste acid.Chlorine dioxide can also be produced from chloric acid (HClO3), involving the advantage that no sodium sulfate by-product is produced.Chloric acid can be prepared by ion exchange such as described in, for example, US patents 3810969 and 4798715, or by electrolyses of alkali metal chlorate such as described in, for example, US patent 4915927. Chloric acid can also be prepared by treating barium chlorate with sulfuric acid and concentrating the dilute chloric acid obtained by evaporation.International patent application WO 91/12356 (corresponding to US patent 5084148) describes a process of producing chloric acid by electrolysing alkali metal chlorate in a divided cell, alkali metal hydroxide, oxygen gas and hydrogen gas being obtained as a valuable by-products. It is said that the chloric acid can serve as a raw material in commercial processes for producing chlorine dioxide, using chloride, sulfur dioxide or methanol as a reducing agent.International patent application WO 92/03374 discloses a process which involves partly converting alkali metal chlorate to chloric acid by electrolyses, feeding a chlorine dioxide reactor with the mixture, and recycling the chlorate to the electrochemical cell. The chlorine dioxide is produced electrochemically or with methanol as a reducing agent.Electrochemical production of chlorine dioxide gives comparatively low current efficiency as well as chemical efficiency. Moreover, the potential for chlorine dioxide decomposition is always present and thus a hazard to sensitive and expensive electrochemical cell equipment.A drawback of using
