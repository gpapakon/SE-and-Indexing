A process for the production of dense silicon nitride 
materials by nitriding of moulded bodies composed of 

mixtures of silicon, silicon nitride and sintering 
additives under normal nitrogen pressure and sintering 

of the moulded bodies at normal nitrogen pressure 
without a protective bed of powder, characterised in 

that the silicon is used in the form of silicon powder 
having an average particle size of from 1 to 20 µm and 

an iron content of not more than 0.7 wt.%. 
The process according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the nitriding is carried out at temperatures of 

from 1000 to 1450°C under normal nitrogen pressure and 
for a reaction time of less than 30 hours. 
The process according to either of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the sintering under normal 

pressure is carried out at temperatures of from 1630 
to 1830°C. 
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the moulded bodies used are 

those obtained by pressing, slip casting or injection 
moulding and having wall thicknesses of more 

than 5 mm. 
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the nitriding and sintering are 

carried out in one furnace cycle under normal nitrogen 
pressure without the use of protective beds of powder.  

 
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that a mixture comprising from 2 to 

60 wt.% of silicon nitride, from 40 to 95 wt.% of 
silicon and up to 20 wt.% of sintering additives is 

used. 
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the sintering additives used are 

rare earth oxides, these being partly substitutable by 
oxides of aluminium and/or of magnesium.
