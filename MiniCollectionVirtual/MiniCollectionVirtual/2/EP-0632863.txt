<DESCRIPTION>
Metal secti on bars for bul l et-proof frames k k k -k -kD E S C R I P T I O N The present invention relates to a set of metal section bars for bullet-proof frames, such as windows, shop-windows, glass doors.Metal section bars are known for bullet-proof door and window frames, formed by a tubular casing having a substantially L-shaped transversal cross-section, comprising an external wall, an internal wall, and transversal walls, and provided, in the proximity of said external wall, with seats for housing bullet-proof olates, preferably made of steel. These section bars are used both for fixed frames and for mobile frames of bullet-proof door and window frames.The main problem of these door and window frames is represented by an insubstantial resistance to the impact of bullets with an enhanced capacity of destruction; thus such a bullet-proofing is inadequate in case of very heavy strains, such as those to which doors and windows of establishments particularly exposed to robberies, for example banks, jeweller's shops, etc., are subjected.The main object of the present invention is a set of metal section bars for bullet-proof door and window frames, capable of offering a resistance to the impact of bullets that is optimized for the different uses.Another object of the invention is a set of section bars for bullet-proof door and window frames, of a form such as to allow the adaptation of their resistance to the specific use, during the assembly stage. 

 According to these objects the invention relates to a set of section bars for bullet-proof door and window frames, each formed by at least one respective tubular casing having a transversal cross-section formed substantially in the shape of an "L", a "Z", a "T", comprising at least one external wall, an internal wall and transversal walls, and provided, in the proximity of said external wall, with at least one seat suitable for housing at least one bullet-proof plate, characterized in that said tubular casing is provided, in the proximity of said internal wall, with at least one other seat suitable for housing at least one other bullet-proof plate. According to a preferred embodiment the abovementioned tubular casing having a substantially "Z"-shaped transversal cross-section, comprises a tubular element with a substantially ,rL"-shaped transversal cross-section and a tubular element with a substantially rectangular transversal cross-section, said tubular elements being connected by an intermediate wall provided with a respective seat suitable for
