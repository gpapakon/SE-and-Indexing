<ABSTRACT>
A metal laminate type cylinder head gasket is formed of 
at least two metal plates for constituting the gasket. The 

gasket includes a plurality of cylinder bores arranged in a 
longitudinal direction, a plurality of first holes situated 

in longitudinal end areas of the gasket, and at least one 
second hole situated in a longitudinal middle area of the 

gasket. The gasket also includes a plurality of first 
grommets situated in and around the first holes, and at least 

one second grommet situated in and around the second hole. 
The thickness of the second grommet is thinner than that of 

the first grommet. Thus, when the gasket is tightened, 
tightening pressure is concentrated in the longitudinal 

middle area to thereby reduce deformation of a cylinder head.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metal laminate type 
cylinder head gasket having grommets with different 
thicknesses to prevent upward expansion or curve of a 
cylinder head of an engine. In order to provide high power and light weight for an 
automobile engine, the engine or at least a cylinder head is 
made of an aluminum alloy. Since the aluminum alloy does not 
have high rigidity, when a gasket is installed in the engine, 
sealing problem between the cylinder head and the cylinder 
block may occur. Namely, in case a plurality of cylinder bores is 
arranged in one or a longitudinal direction, when the gasket 
is tightened between the cylinder head and the cylinder block 
by bolts, sealing means situated around the respective 
cylinder bores are compressed. In this respect, the bolts 
located in a middle portion of the engine operate to tighten 
two, i.e. right and left, portions of the sealing means 
relative to the bolt, while the bolts at the longitudinal 
ends of the engine only tighten one portion of the sealing 
means. Thus, the bolts at the longitudinal ends operate to 
tighten the sealing means at a pressure generally twice as 
much as the rest of the portion of the sealing means. The unbalanced tightening pressure causes the middle  
 
portion of the cylinder head to move upwardly. As a result, 
the equal sealing pressure is not applied to the sealing 
means. In a long usage, leaking occurs in the cylinder head 
or other holes. In order to support the edges of the cylinder head, 
beads may be formed. In USP 4,834,399, a bead is formed 
around the entire outer portion of the gasket. However, 
since the bead completely surrounds the edge portion of the 
gasket, the bead can not support required portions. In Japanese Utility Model Publication (KOKAI) No. 61-69450, 
longitudinal end portions of a gasket are made thicker 
than a middle portion of the gasket. The thickness of the 
gasket is adjusted such that the height of beads around the 
cylinder bores located at the longitudinal end portions is 
made higher than that around the cylinder bore in the middle 
portion of the gasket, or that small holes, such as water 
holes, oil holes and so on, located at the longitudinal end 
portions are equipped with sealing beads, while a bead is not 
formed around the small holes at the middle portion. In the above case, if the beads are compressed for a 
long time in a high temperature condition, the beads may 
creep and loose the spring ability. Therefore, the sealing 
ability decreases in the above

<CLAIMS>
A metal laminate type cylinder head gasket (10) 
provided with a plurality of holes, grommets and beads 

around the holes, and comprising at least two metal 
plates for constituting the gasket, said plurality of 

holes including a plurality of cylinder bores arranged in 
a longitudinal direction, 


said plurality of holes comprising at least one 
first hole (11', 13', 14') situated in each longitudinal 

end area of the gasket and at least one second hole (11, 
13, 14) situated in a longitudinal middle area of the 

gasket,
 
characterised in that 
a first grommet (21) is situated in and around the 
first hole (11', 13', 14') said grommet being laterally 

spaced from and laterally inside the respective bead, and 
a second grommet (20) is situated in and around the 
second hole (11, 13, 14) said grommet being laterally 

spaced from and laterally inside the respective bead, 
the thickness of the second grommet (20) being less 
than that of the first grommets (21) so that when the 

gasket is tightened deformation of a cylinder head is 
reduced. 
A metal laminate type cylinder head gasket according 
to claim 1 wherein said first and second grommets are 

arranged to support a load applied to the beads to 
prevent complete compression and creep relaxation of the 

beads.  
 
A metal laminate type cylinder head gasket according 
to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said first and second holes 

are selected from a group consisting of cylinder bores, 
bolt holes, water holes, oil holes and push rod holes. 
A metal laminate type cylinder head gasket according 
to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein all the cylinder bores have 

the same sealing means, and said first and second holes 
are selected from a group consisting of bolt holes, water 

holes, oil holes and push rod holes. 
A metal laminate type cylinder head gasket according 
to any preceding claim, wherein said gasket has two 

longitudinal end areas, each longitudinal end area being 
defined by a longitudinal edge of the gasket and an area 

of the cylinder bore located in a longitudinal end of the 
gasket. 
A metal laminate type cylinder head gasket according 
to claim 5 wherein said longitudinal middle area is 

sandwiched between the two longitudinal end areas.
