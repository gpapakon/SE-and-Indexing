<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for composting organic waste and to a device for carrying it out. The procedure, based on the teachings left by the Templars, comprises the following working stages:     a) humidification by immersion in water;   b) precomposting in a digester.   c) final maturing, and it is characterised in that all the working stages take place continuously, that is to say that the material is in continuous motion. The procedure makes it possible to shorten especially the duration of the composting operation and to mechanise it completely. The device for carrying out the procedure comprises a humidification chamber (1), a digester consisting of one or a number of chambers (7, ...7x) and a maturing chamber (14) placed one after the other and through which the material passes successively in well-defined times and under controlled conditions.

Composting plant for implementing the method according to the claim 8,
characterized in that

the plant consists of the following elements:

a) a humidifying chamber (1) for the material, which is to shredded and to
contain at least partially a watery liquid and which is to be fed substantially

continually to the upper portion, which chamber is of cylindrical
form with its axle oriented vertically and is open at its upper end presenting

an opening for the material to be composted and is open at its
bottom end which is fastened to a rotational axle (3) about which the

chamber (1) rotates and on the outer surface of which an endless
screw (4) is mounted rotating in a stationary cylinder (6) and lifting the

material essentially continually from the bottom to the top;
b) one or a plurality of chambers (7, 7', ... 7x), which together form the digesting
or pre-composting room, each chamber with its axle (11, 11', ...

11x) extending vertically and which completely surrounds the humidifying
chamber (1) about its whole circumference and which is to be

supplied with material from above, which material has been lifted by the
endless screw (4) rotating together with the humidifying chamber (1) to

which it is mounted, and which in its lower portion is provided with a device
for taking off material (9);
c) a maturing chamber for the material (14, 25) arranged below the humidifying
chamber (1) chambers (7, 7', ... 7x) which form the digesting

or pre-composting room and into which the take-off devices (9) for the
material of the individual chambers extend, and which at its bottom (23)

is provided with a material take-off system (15) using which the mature
compost material is taken off essentially continuously.
Composting plant according to the claim 1
characterized in that
 
the wall portions (16, ... 16x) of the circular chambers (7, ... 7x) forming the

digesting or pre-composting room, which are facing the surrounding outer
room are thermally insulated, whereas the wall portions (17, ... 17x) of the

circular chambers (7, ... 7x) forming the digesting or pre-composting room,
which are facing the humidifying chamber (1) are not insulated thermally,

in which arrangement between two neighbouring chambers (7, ... 7x) forming
the digesting or pre-composting room eac
h and the humidifying chamber
(1) a vertical duct (8, ... 8x) of approximately triangular cross-section

with concave walls is enclosed through which air is blown from the bottom
to the top which subsequently flows through the digesting or pre-composting

room in such a manner that the pre-composting phase can be effected
under aerobic decomposition of the material.
Composting plant according to the claim 1
characterized in that

the material removing system (9) in each of the cylindrical chambers (7, ...
7x) forming the digesting or pre-composting room is formed by a disc (10)

which rotates about its vertical axle (11) and closes the lower portion of the
chamber (7, ... 7x), and in the surface of which a series of radially extending

rectangular openings is provided which openings with increasing distance
from the axle (11) are lined up staggered in such a manner that the

whole disc surface is covered where, seen in he direction of rotation, the
front edge of each rectangular opening (19) is provided with a series of

points (20) engaging the material column (21) from below and scraping off
material which via the corresponding opening (19) drops into the maturing

chamber (14) arranged directly below.
Composting plant according to the claim 1
characterized in that

the material removing system (15) which removes the mature compost
material from the maturing chamber (14) consists of a transporting device

with an essentially cylindrical endless screw (22) which extends radially 
across the floor (23) of the maturing chamber (14) one end of the screw

being fastened at the centre of said chamber (14) and which rotates about
said end in such a manner as to sweep the entire floor (23) of the chamber

(14) in which process the endless screw (22) transports the mature compost
material from the outer rim of the maturing chamber (14) towards its

centre said material being removed from the plant via a central transporting
duct (24) to the outside.
Composting plant according to the claim 1
characterized in that

the material removing system (15) which removes the mature compost material
(29) from the maturing chamber (14) consists of a raking lattice (26),

arranged on the floor (27) of the substantially rectangular maturing chamber
(25), which reciprocates to and fro in such a manner that the mature

compost material to be removed is shifted towards one of the lateral walls
of the maturing chamber (25) from where it is removed from the plant.
Composting plant according to the claim 4, or to the claim 5 respectively,
characterized in that

the endless screw (22), or the raking lattice (26) respectively, is connected
to a supply duct from which dry air is distributed over the full length of the

endless screw (22), or of the raking lattice respectively (26), in such a
manner that said air is forced from below towards the top to the upper portion

of the material column (29) in such a manner that the mature compost
material is dried before being taken off.

or from synthetic resins.

a) the humidifying phase is effected by immersion in a watery liquid during
a time period of 2 to 10 h;
b) the aerobic pre-composting phase is effected in a digesting or pre-composting
