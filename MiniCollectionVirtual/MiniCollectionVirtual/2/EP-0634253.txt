<ABSTRACT>
A press (11), usable in particular as a platen press for woodworking, generates the pressing pressure by means of two superposed rows (20, 21) of flexible tubes (19) which are filled with compressed air. An intermediate plate (17) ensures pressure equalisation. The pressing surfaces are formed by heated platens (29), the bottom one of which can be partly pulled out beyond the press frame to facilitate charging and cleaning.

<CLAIMS>
Press, particularly a platen press for woodworking, with a press drive
by pneumatically inflatable hoses (19), in which there are at least two

superimposed rows (20, 21) of hoses (19), characterized in that the hoses
(19) in at least two hose rows (20, 21) are arranged with their ends and in

particular with end pneumatic connections (23) in mutually displaced manner
in the hose longitudinal direction.
Press according to claim 1, characterized in that the hoses (19) of the
hose rows (20, 21) are in each case of the same length.
Press according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
the hoses (19) of different hose rows (20, 21) provided on one side with end

pneumatic connections (23) have said end pneumatic connections (23) at
different ends (22) of the hoses (19).
Press according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that in
each case adjacent hoses (19) in a hose row (20, 21) alternately have end

pneumatic connections (23) at one or other end (22).
Press, particularly a platen press for woodworking according to one of
the preceding claims, with a press drive by pneumatically inflatable hoses

(19), with a rigid, frame-like press support (12) with a reinforced, upper
and lower support plate (13, 14), a plate having a pressing surface (30) in

substantially horizontal manner is displaceably guided at least partly over
and beyond the press support, characterized in that on their top the hoses

(19) carry the plate constructed as a heating plate (29) which, with respect
to an insulating plate carrying the heating plate is displaceably guided

thereon.
Press according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
pneumatic press drive has a pressure takeover valve which, following a

preferably pulse-controlled pressure build-up in the hoses (19), keeps said
pressure above a predetermined value.
