<ABSTRACT>
A device for sampling body fluid (84) in a tube (72) fitted with sampling means (88), the tube (72) being substantially compressible over at least a part of its length and having a first end which can be connected to a container (64) for a medical liquid (68), comprises compression means (96) mounted on the tube (72) for interacting with the tube (72) in a first position in which the passage is free inside the tube (72) and in a second position in which the tube (72) is closed off by a compression point, the compression means (96) being capable of being moved by sliding along the tube (72) into the second position, and sliding of the compression means (96) causing displacement of liquid in the tube (72) towards and/or from the container (64). This device is particularly suited to sampling blood from an infusion (drip) line.
