<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a seam protecting 
device which can be applied to drum grinding 

or raising machines, for preventing threads connecting 
adjoining pieces to be processed from breaking, 

characterized in that the device comprises at least 
a pair of ring-like elements (1), parallel to one another 

and connected by means of connnecting beams or bars, 
adapted to turn about bearings (2) and a drum (3) provided 

with raising or grinding cylinders (4). 
To the pair of ring-like elements there is 
applied a cusp element (8) which, under a normal condition, 

is located at the bottom part of the drum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a seam protecting 
device, designed for application to drum 
grinding or raising machines, for preventing threads 
connecting pieces to be processed from accidentally 
breaking. As is known, the drum raising and grinding 
machines conventionally comprise cylinder means for 
driving the fabric to be processed. More specifically, with respect to the raising 
machine, the fabric is continuously supplied to 
a drum including several raising cylinders, on the 
surfaces of which there are provided a plurality 
of teeth which raise the surface of the fabric, by 
exerting a pulling action on the fibres forming 
the several threads. In the grinding machines, on the other hand, 
the drum is provided with grinding cylinders, coated 
by abrasive strips, which subject the fabrics, 
preferably of cotton, lap, microfibre of silk type, 
to a suitable grinding or sanding action, so as to 
provide the fabric with a peach peel effect. Both in the raising operation and in the 
grinding operation, the fabric is subjected to  
 
great mechanical stresses which cause the cotton or 
nylon threads used for connecting to one another 
two adjoining pieces to break. At present, for overcoming the above mentioned 
drawback, the two above mentioned machines are 
provided, at the driving cylinders thereof arranged 
upstream of the drum, with a sensing element to detect 
the presence of seams. This sensor, however, upon sensing the presence 
of seams, resets to zero the raising or grinding 
speed of the cylinders located on the drum, 
which usually turn about themselves. Thus, a comparatively long length of the 
fabric piece is not processed, and it must be rejected, 
with a consequent great damage from the 
yield standpoint. The document US-A-50 84 948 discloses in column 16, lines 8-30, a seam detector enabling to control the operating parameters of a napping machine. Accordingly, the aim of the present invention 
is to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks, 
by providing a seam protecting device, for application 
to drum grinding or raising machines, adapted 
to prevent threads connecting adjoining pieces to 
be processed from accidentally breaking, which device 
is also adapted to process the portion of the  
 
fabric arranged near fabric seams, without causing 
any breakages of the cotton or nylon threads used 
for mutually connecting two adjoining pieces. Within the scope of the above mentioned 
aim, a main object of the present invention is to 
provide such a device which is very reliable and

<CLAIMS>
A seam protecting device, for application 
to a grinding or raising machine of the type including a 

drum and raising or grinding cylinders, said device 
being adapted to prevent threads connecting adjoining 

pieces of fabric from breaking, characterized in that 
said device comprises at least a pair of parallel 

mutually connected ring-like elements (1) one of said 
rings being located on a side of said fabric and the 

other of said rings being located on the other side of 
said fabric and being adapted to turn about bearing 

means (2) and said drum (3), to said rings being applied 
a cusp element (8), extending transversely of the entire 

length of said fabric, said cusp element (8) having its 
vertex directed towards the inside of said fabric so as 

to cause the seamed regions thereof to be separated from 

said cylinders (4) of said grinding or raising machine, 
thereby protecting said seamed regions. 
A seam protecting device according to Claim 
1, characterized in that said cusp element (8), under a 

normal condition, is arranged at a bottom portion of 
said drum (3). 
A seam protecting device according to 
Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that said cusp element 

(8) can turn through 360° about said drum (3). 
A seam protecting device according to one 
or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that  

 
said cusp element (8) is caused to rotate about said 

drum (3) through nearly 360°, and then it being stopped 
and the turning direction thereof being reversed. 
A seam protecting device according to one 
or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that 

said cusp element (8) has a turning peripheral speed 
about said drum (3) equal to the advancing speed of the 

fabric on said drum (3). 
A seam protecting device according to one 
or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that 

the turning peripheral speed of said cusp element (8) is 
controlled by a three-phase motor, driven by an 

inverter, or by a brushless motor, or by a DC motor or 
an electronic speed varying device.
