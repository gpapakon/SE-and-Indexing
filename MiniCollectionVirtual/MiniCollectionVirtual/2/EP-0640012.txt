<DESCRIPTION>
 OLEFIN POLYMERIZATION CATALYST SYSTEMThe present invention is directed to an olefin polymerization catalyst system based upon a member of the class of conventional titanium trichloride catalysts, in association with a novel cocatalyst based upon an aluminum trialkyl and a silane component as further described herein. The cocatalyst provides isotactic olefin polymers with higher catalytic activity than catalyst systems of the prior art.One of the earliest classes of Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems developed for use in the polymerization of olefins, especially alpha-olefins such as ethylene and propylene, were catalyst systems that include titanium and aluminum in the form of titanium trihalide catalysts and organoaluminum compounds as cocatalysts. The relatively simple nature of these systems provided a compelling case for their use compared to more complex so-called 'high activity' Ziegler-Natta solid catalyst components which include titanium (IV) and magnesium.The polymerization of propylene among other stereochemical monomers concerns itself with the structural ordering of the resulting polymer. The most desirable polymers for industrial use are isotactic, those where in recurring triads, the depending methyl groups are on the same side of the molecule, affording long term order and hence properties related to developed crystallinity.Naturally, it was and is important commercially to secure such highly isotactic polymers in high yield, and therefore one sought catalysts of high activity as measured by weight of polymer per unit weight of catalyst, and to control other polymerization parameters to direct morphology of the resulting polymer 

to afford other desirable properties such as high crystalline melting point, and high bulk density.Unfortunately, the use of aluminum trialkyl cocatalysts with titanium trichloride catalysts never provided commercially useful polymers. It was discovered, however, that dialkyl aluminum halides were effective and these cocatalysts have been used nearly exclusively in industry. No satisfactory substitute had heretofore been found despite considerable interest and economic motivation. It became generally recognized in the art that while aluminum alkyls such as triethyl aluminum could usefully be employed as cocatalysts for titanium (IV) catalysts they were unuseable on a commercial scale for titanium (III) polymerizations.It was, therefore, highly surprising to discover that an aluminum alkyl used coordinately with a silane modifier as described was not only effective
