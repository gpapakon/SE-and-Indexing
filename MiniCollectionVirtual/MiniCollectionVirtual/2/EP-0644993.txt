<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
evacuated thermally insulating jacket 
and in particular the jacket of a dewar or of another 
cryogenic device, like for instance dedicated pipings 
for the storage and/or the transport of cryogenic 
gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, helium, 
argon etc. or of other substances requiring the maintenance 
of a temperature different from room temperature, 
usually lower, the insulating features of said 
jackets being notoriously reached by means of vacuum 
and of an insulating material. The new jacket is particularly advantageous, 
as it is able to be put in condition to 
work in a very short time. It is known, according to the common practice, 
to use for the purposes above dewars or pipings having 
a vacuum jacket in order to reach an adequate thermal 
insulation. As a further thermoinsulating measure, 
there is usually inserted in the jacket an insulating 
material like glass wool, expanded organic polymers 
(e.g. polyurethane and resins having various compositions) 
and, very frequently, the so called "multilayers". 
These latter are consisting of alternated  
 
sheets made from organic polymers (such as polyolefines), 
preferably showing a cross-linked structure, 
and of aluminized plastics, obtained for instance, as 
it is known, by coating a plastic film with aluminium 
by means of evaporation under vacuum. It is also known that the vacuum, in said jacket, 
has the tendency to degrade along the time, 
because of the outgassing of the inner components and 
even of the walls (namely by emission of gaseous species 
like CO, N2, H2, H2O, O2 etc.) and owing to possible 
"leaks" (namely penetration of an atmospheric 
gas). In order to maintain the vacuum, there is 
normally utilized a gas sorbing material, placed in 
the jacket and generally consisting of zeolites, molecular 
sieves, silica gel, activated carbon (charcoal) 
and other sorbing material having physical action. 
These substances have to be kept at a very low temperature, 
e.g. the temperature of liquid nitrogen or a 
lower one, in order to allow the sorption of the most 
part of such gaseous species. Moreover, the physical 
sorbing materials hereinabove do not effectively sorb 
hydrogen. Therefore it was required in the past, for 
instance, to insert in the jacket palladium oxide, as 
disclosed by GB-A-921273. Pd oxide in fact converts 
hydrogen into water, according to the reaction: 
PdO + H2 → Pd + H2O 
   Water is then physically sorbed by the zeolites 
or by the other physical adsorbents present

A 
thermally insulating jacket and in particular 

the thermally insulating jacket (5) of dewar or of 
another cryogenic device (1), having an inner wall (2) 

and an outer wall (4), and having the inner space 
between said walls completely or partially filled with 

an insulating material (9), wherein said inner space 
also contains a moisture sorbing material (10) and a 

getter material (11), characterized in that said 
moisture sorbing material (10) and said getter (11) are 

arranged in a container (12) subdivided into a inner 
(14) and an outer (15) zone by a porous septum (13), 

wherein: 

the inner zone (14) contains said getter (11); 
the outer zone (15) is communicating with the 
inner space containing said insulating material 

(9) and contains said moisture sorbing material

through said septum (13) and towards said getter 
(11). 
A jacket according to claim 1, wherein in the 
case no liquid hydrogen is present inside or outside 

said jacket (5), said outer zone (15) also contains a 
hydrogen converter, preferably selected from the oxides 

of osmium, iridium, ruthenium, rhodium and palladium. 
A jacket according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said container (12) is a vertical box having an 

opening at its uppermost portion and a planar septum 
(13).  

 
A jacket according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said container (12) is a toroidal box having a 

radial or planar septum (13).

characterized in that said septum (13) is horizontal. 
A jacket according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said container (12) is a rigid, semirigid or 

flexible box. 
A jacket according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said container (12) is made from a 

substantially water-free material, selected from metal, 
glass, ceramics and combinations thereof.
