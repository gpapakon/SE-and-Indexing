(5a, 5b) comprises foamed polystyrene or the like.
A connecting arrangement according to claim 1 or claim 2
characterised by a covering means (12) which in its dimensions preferably

goes beyond the dimensions of the cover or cover region (5a) covering the
heating body connections (3) and which can be connected to the connecting

box (2) after removal of said cover or cover region (5a).
A connecting arrargement according to claim 3 characterised in
that the covering means (12) completely closes the connecting box (2)

except for two outlet openings (20, 21) for connecting lines (10) leading
to the heating body (9).
A connecting arrangement according to claim 4 characterised in
that the covering means nas two lateral recesses (20, 21) which when the

covering means (12) is fitted form the outlet openings. 
A connecting arrangement according to claim 5 characterised in
that the cutlet openings (20. 21) of the covering means (12), for passing

out the connecting lines (10), have openings in a direction in inclined
relationship with respect to the surface of the covering means.
A connecting arrangement according to claims 5 and 6
characterised in that the recesses are at least partially covered over by a

rump-shaped raised portion.
A connecting arrangement according to one of claims 3 to 7
characterised in that the covering means (12) comprise plastics material

and extends further downwardly beyond the region of the heating body
connections (3), wherein proviced in the covering means (12) in said lower

region are a plurality of horizontally extending desired-rupture locations
(24).
A connecting arrangement according to claim 1 characterised in
that the connecting box (2) extends downwardly preferably in one piece from

the heating body connections (3) and there receives the flow and return
lines (6) leading to the heating body connections (3).
A connecting arrargement according to claim 9 characterised in
that both the connecting box (2) and the cover (5b) have in the region of

the flow and return lines (6) semicircular recesses (15') which together
completely surround the flow and return lines (6) when the cover (5b) is

fitted.
A connecting arrangement according to claim 1 characterised in
that the cover (5a, 5b) has at least two regions which are connected

together by way of a desired-rupture location (17) or is formed from at
least two separate portions. 
A connecting arrargement according to claim 11 characterised
in that the one cover region (5b) is thicker and is also supported on the

connecting box (2) at locations remote from the peripheral edge while the
other cover region (5a) is thinner and only bears against the connecting

box (2) at the peripheral edge (16), forming a hollow space (14).
A connecting arrangement according to claim 1 characterised in
that the connecting box (2) primarily comprises heat-insulating plastics

material, preferably foamed polystyrene or the like.
A connecting arrangement according to claim 13 characterised
in that the connecting box has a holding portion (19), preferably a flat

bar, for mounting the heating body connections (3) securely in position in
the connecting box (2).
A connecting arrangement according to claim 14 characterised
in that the holding portion (19) projects beyond the outside wall of the

connecting box (2).
A connecting arrangement according to claim 1 characterised in
than there is provided a special cover (portion) (32), for example as a

tile pattern, which closes the connecting box (2) in the region of the
heating body connections (3) and projects beyond the front face of the

correcting box (2).
A connecting arrangement according to claim 16 characterised
in that the special cover (portion) (32) has two lateral projections (33)

witch extend beyond the connecting box (2).
A connecting arrangement according to claim 1 characterised in
that the two heating body connections are in the form of a common 

connecting portion (25) which has two connections (26) for the flow and
return lines and is arranged as a structural unit in the connecting box

(2).
A connecting arrangement according to claim 18 characterised
in that the connecting portion (25) has at least one shut-off valve (28)

fcr shutting off the two heating body connections (3).
A connecting arrangement according to claim 18 or claim 19
characterised in that the connecting portion (25) has a short-circuit

communication (29) between the flow and return lines, which permits a flow
from the flow line to the return line even when the heating body valve (11)

or the shut-off valves (28) is or are closed.
A connecting arrangement according to claim 20 characterised
in that there is provided an adjustable throttle (30) with which the

effective through-flow cross-section between the flow and return lines is
variable.
