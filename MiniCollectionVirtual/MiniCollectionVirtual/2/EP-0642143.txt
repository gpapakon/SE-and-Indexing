<ABSTRACT>
The coil includes a winding coiled over a straight-line core consisting, for example, of a ferrite cylinder (4) held firmly within a cylinder (1) of moulded plastic, which, on its outer cylindrical surface, includes a longitudinal groove in which is placed a bar (2) made of electrically resistive material and which is clamped under the wire of the coil (3). Applications: injection of current at low frequency into a cable of a television distribution network.

<CLAIMS>
An inductor comprising a winding of electrical wire wound on a straight magnetic
core, characterized in that it comprises a bar (2) made of an electrically resistive material,

which bar is interposed between the winding and the core (1,4), the winding is formed by
non-contiguous turns of a bare wire (3), and the wire is in contact with the bar.
An inductor as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the core comprises at least
one external cylindrical part (1) of a plastics material in whose surface a longitudinal

groove is formed in which the bar is mounted, and the cross-section of the bar in relation to
that of the groove is dimensioned in such a manner that a part of the bar extends outside the

groove so as to contact the winding wire.
An inductor as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that the cylinder of a plastics
material accommodates at least one ferrite cylinder (4).
An inductor as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that the cylinder of a plastics
material has a helical groove (5) in its outer cylindrical surface.
An inductor as claimed in any one of the Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the
bar is made of an insulating material loaded with a conductive powder.
An inductor as claimed in Claim 5, characterized in that the insulating material is
silicone.
An inductor as claimed in Claim 5 or 6, characterized in that the conductive
powder consists of carbon.
An inductor as claimed in any one ofthe Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the
electrical wire consists of tinned copper.
