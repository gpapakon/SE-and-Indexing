<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for the suction of yarn,
intended for waste, in textile machines. The device is of the type
comprises
the features of the preamble of claim 1.Suction devices of the type referred above are already known. For
example, devices are known which provide a connection conduit
between said trapping mouth and said yarn suction conduit which has a
winding and complex configuration, aimed at creating a vacuum in an
area upstream of said trapping mouth by injecting pressurised air into
the secondary connection conduit mentioned (see e.g. US-A-3 241 234).Said device is disadvantageous in various respects. Above all it has an
excessively complex configuration which entails appreciable 
manufacturing costs. Moreover, said known device has the
disadvantage that a considerable quantity of pressurised air has to be
supplied to be injected inside the winding connection conduit with the
aim of creating a sufficient suction pressure inside said conduit such as
to aspirate the yarn towards the main vacuum conduit.This entails the use of considerable quantities of compressed air,
compressed up to a high pressure value. Said use is too onerous, both
due to the excessive use of energy for compression and due to the cost
of the relevant compression equipment to be made available for
compressing such considerable quantities of air.The use of such a device also involves a disadvantageous drop in the
vacuum pressure inside said main suction conduit. This disadvantage
is even more damaging inside textile machines wherein a main vacuum
suction conduit is connected to several yarn trapping mouths. The
drops in vacuum pressure caused by injecting compressed air lead to a
considerable drop in the pressure inside said main conduit with
resulting malfunctioning of the yarn suction which may even totally
eliminate the suction pressure thus making it impossible to use the
suction system itself.With the use of such a type of device for controlling suction inside yarn
suction systems in textile machines, on the one hand either the number
of trapping mouths which can be connected to said main conduit has to 
be limited, restricting the flexibility of use of the suction system, or, on
the other hand, the value of the vacuum pressure applied inside the
suction system has to be forced to increase, again with the need to use
excessive quantities of energy for the appropriate equipment which
creates said vacuum, the latter having to be more powerful and
sophisticated and hence more expensive.The object of
