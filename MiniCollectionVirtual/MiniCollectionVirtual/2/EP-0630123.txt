<ABSTRACT>
The device for reshaping a train of optical pulses includes an electroabsorbing modulator (11) to which the train of pulses is sent in order to be resynchronised and reshaped; a generator (12) of a periodic signal which is adjustable in phase and in frequency which delivers to this modulator (11) a periodic signal which controls this modulator (11) in terms of voltage; servo control means (13) controlling this generator (12) in terms of phase and of frequency, in such a way that the average of the photocurrent (iph), output by the modulator (11) when it is in its absorbing state and when it receives an optical pulse, is a minimum. This device can also be used for recovering a periodic signal synchronised to a train of modulated optical pulses. Application to long-distance telecommunication by soliton pulse transmission by optical fibres.
