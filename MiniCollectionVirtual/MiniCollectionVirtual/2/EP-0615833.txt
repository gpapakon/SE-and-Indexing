<ABSTRACT>
A method of joining at least two thermoplastic materials is provided 
in which one of the materials has a conductive material, for example a 

length of wire (30) embedded within it and in which the materials to be 
joined are positioned together and the conductive material made to pass 

a current so that it heats up causing the thermoplastic materials to 
melt locally and fuse. In a particular application the method is used to 

attach a beading (8,12,14) to a luggage case (20). A hard side luggage 
case having a thus joined beading and which in a particular embodiment 

includes a lining (20) which also becomes attached to the case in the 
method is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of joining 
a thermoplastic beading to a luggage case (e.g. a suitcase, 
briefcase), and also relates to the piece of luggage so 
formed. In a prior art heat sealing process, the EMAWELD 
process, a thermoplastic matrix loaded with ferromagnetic 
powder is extruded as a strip and placed between two other 
plastics surfaces to be fused. The extruded strip is heated 
by exposing it to a high frequency alternating current and 
the adjacent plastics surfaces are thus also heated to a 
temperature at which they fuse with the EMAWELD strip, or 
with each other. There are disadvantages associated with 
this method. For example, it is difficult to extrude the 
plastic when it is loaded with ferromagnetic material, and 
the whole process is expensive to perform. When making hard side luggage cases, it would be 
extremely desirable to be able to seal a plastic strip to 
another thermoplastic material cheaply and easily. The 
plastic beading acts as a water-tight seal to prevent water 
seeping into the suitcase or as a cushion when the suitcase 
is closed and the two shells come together. The beading 
also helps to prevent dust and dirt entering the suitcase. In more detail, so-called hard side luggage which is 
typically made of polypropylene or polyethylene often has a  
 
plastic beading fitted into grooves around the periphery of 
the upper and lower shells that make up the suitcase. See, 
e.g. US-A-2969891 and US-A-4993585. The plastic beading may 
be made of a soft plastics material, for example, 
polypropylene, low density polyethylene or ethylvinyl 
acetate, so that it acts as a cushion. The beading may also 
be coloured for a pleasing aesthetic effect. Until now, 
beading has been attached to the suitcase using adhesives, 
screws or rivets. This method of fixing is time consuming, 
labour intensive and therefore expensive. The use of 
adhesives can give a messy result and screws and rivets tend 
to look untidy in the finished article. In addition, screws 
and rivets may cause damage to clothes and can cause injury 
to the user. They may also become detached from the beading 
and will then need replacing. In US-A-2969891 the beading 
is retained by being housed in a deep, restricted-mouth, 
groove on strips which are spot-welded to the shell. Hard-side luggage does not usually have an inner 
lining of cloth or other fabric because there are no frames 
to conceal the edges of the lining. If a lining is 
required, a frame will need to be attached for this purpose,

<CLAIMS>
A method of attaching a beading to a thermoplastic 
shell of a hard side luggage case (2) which comprises 

orienting a beading (8,12,14) in a desired location on a 
luggage case shell (4,6) and securing it there characterized by 

passing a current through a length of conductive material 
(28) at least partly embedded in the thermoplastic beading whereby 

the material of the thermoplastic beading and shell melt and 
fuse locally, to bond the beading to the luggage case shell. 
A method according to claim 1 which further 
comprises a first step of extruding a length of said beading 

(8,12,14) together with a length of said conductive material 
(28) whereby the conductive material is embedded in the 

beading. 
A method according to claim 2 wherein the conductive 
material (28) is a wire. 
A method according to claim 1 which further includes 
trapping the edge of a lining (20) between the beading 

(12,14) and case shell (4,6) whereby when a current is 
passed through the wire, the edge of the lining also melts 

and fuses with the beading and/or case shell. 
A method according to claim 4 which further 
comprises fixing the remainder of the lining (20) to the 

inside of the case shell (4,6). 
A method according to any one of the preceding  
 

claims wherein the desired location is a channel in the case 
shell (10,16,18) into which the beading (8,12,14) is 

inserted to orient it on the case shell (4,6). 
A hard side luggage case (2) which comprises at 
least two hard shells (4,6), at least one hard shell having 

a plastics beading (8,12,16) around its periphery which in 
the closed luggage cast abuts the other hard shell, 

characterized in that the plastics beading (8,12,14) has a 
conductive material (28) at least partly embedded therein, 

part of said plastics beading being fused with the periphery 
of said one shell to attach said plastics beading thereto. 
A hard side luggage case (2) of claim 7, further 
comprises a lining 
(20) which is fused at its edge with the 
periphery of said one hard shell and the beading. 
A hard side luggage case (2) according to claim 8 
wherein the remainder of the lining (20) is closely fitted 

and attached to the one hard shell on its inner surface.
