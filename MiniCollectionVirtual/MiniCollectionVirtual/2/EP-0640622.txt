<ABSTRACT>
A novel polysaccharide derivative, and a drug carrier and a drug composite both comprising said derivative. 
The derivative is a carboxylated polysaccharide wherein a peptide chain composed of one to eight same or different 

amino acids is introduced into part or all of the carboxyl groups of the polysaccharide and wherein part or all of 
those amino or carboxyl groups of the peptide chain which do not participate in the above linkage to the carboxyl 

groups of the polysaccharide may be bonded to the carboxyl, amino or hydroxyl groups of another compound (e.g. 
a drug) through amide or ester bonds. The derivative can migrate to the tumor-bearing region so readily that it can 

efficiently send drugs which are problematic in the side effects or have limited persistence of the drug activity in the 
tumor-bearing region.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drug carrier
comprising a novel polysaccharide and a drug complex. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a drug
carrier comprising a polysaccharide combined with a
peptide, and a drug complex comprising the drug carrier and
a drug introduced into the drug carrier.An attempt to use a water-soluble polymer as a
carrier for a drug has hitherto been made especially in the
field of a pharmaceutical preparation, and many related
techniques for this purpose have been proposed in the art.
In many of these proposals, use is made of cellulose
derivatives such as carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl
cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and the
dispersion and sustained release of the drug are intended
by virtue of physical and chemical properties of these
substances per se. While in these attempts the drug is
mixed homogeneously with the cellulose derivatives as a
carrier, the drug is not chemically bonded to the carrier.In the so-called "drug delivery technique" wherein
a drug is delivered by a necessary amount at a desired time
to a target organ, when a water-soluble polymer is utilized
as a carrier for a drug, the drug and the carrier should be
chemically bonded to each other rather than mere mixing.
There have been reported such attempts for polysaccharides
in the following references 1), 2) and 3). Reference 1)
discloses the technique to bond a carboxylated dextran with
mitomycin C. Reference 2) discloses the technique to bond
mannan with mitomycin C. Moreover, reference 3) discloses
the technique to bond mannan with bleomycin.
1) Hitoshi Sezaki, Yakugaku Zasshi, 109, 611-621 (1989),2) Proceeding of the 49th Japanese Cancer Association
(1990) p. 425, No. 2155, 3) Proceeding of the 49th Japanese Cancer Association
(1990) p. 425, No. 2154.It is, however, the present situation that the drug
delivery technique by means of chemical bond between a drug
and a carrier have not sufficiently developed for attempt
yet.The present inventors have examined the possibility
for use of polysaccharides as a drug carrier. As a result,
it has been found that a polysaccharide derivative in which
a peptide chain is introduced into a polysaccharide
exhibits an excellent property as a drug carrier.Therefore, an object of the present invention is to
provide a novel drug carrier on which a drug is conjugated
through chemical bond and which is capable of drug
delivery, and a drug complex of the drug carrier and a
drug.Thus, the present invention provides a
polysaccharide
