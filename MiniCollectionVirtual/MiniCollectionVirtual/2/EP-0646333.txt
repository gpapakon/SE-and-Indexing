<ABSTRACT>
The proposed device for mounting the adjustable holder of a protective face guard and/or protective ear cups is distinguished by the use of plastic parts which can be produced and assembled efficiently. The bearing bars (110) are engaged on coupling cams, as a result of which at least two positions - protective face guard lowered or raised - can be set in a stable manner. The holding bars (150) which bear the protective ear cups can be pivoted on and off. The retained setting positions are made possible by a combination, acting as a switch, of a claw (152) located at the end of the holding bar (150) and a spring web acting against it with a nose profile (149). If the protective ear cups are to be taken out of use for a prolonged period, the holding bars (150) can be pivoted towards the rear. The system is well protected from soiling, loose parts are avoided, and it is also suitable for the field of electrical engineering due to the exclusive use of plastic materials.

and the inner contour (
113
) of which possesses a notching
which is complementary to the outer contour of the coupling

cam (
