<ABSTRACT>
The catalytic fixed-bed reactor (100) for at least one fluid medium is provided with packing elements (10) arranged in the form of a stack, each of which packing elements are composed of layers oriented along the main direction (2) of flow. The layers are formed by cushion-like packing parts (1) the walls (1a, 1b) of which are permeable to the medium. The packing parts contain a catalyst material (3). The intermediate spaces of the packing parts are flow channels which cross each other and are mutually open. According to the invention, the interiors of the packing parts are formed by parallel channels (11) which are present in the form of a relief-like profiling of the walls (1a, 1b), these channels crossing each other, being mutually open and closed at the rim (12) of the packing parts. In addition, the walls touch at points in the internal region of the packing parts and at least at some of these contact points (15) the two walls are joined together.

A catalysing fixed-bed reactor (100) for at least one
fluid medium, having packing elements (10) disposed in

stacks, each of which is composed of layers aligned along
the main direction of flow (2), wherein the layers are

formed by cushion-like packing parts (1), which comprise
walls (1a, 1b) permeable to the medium and contain a

catalyst material (3), and wherein flow ducts, which
intersect and are open to one another, are provided

between the packing parts,
characterised in that
 the interior spaces of the packing
parts are formed by parallel ducts (11), which are

provided in the form of a relief-type profiling of the
walls (1a, 1b),
in that
 these ducts (1) intersect, are open to one
another and are also sealed at the edge (12) of the

packing parts,
in that
 the walls touch in punctiform manner in the inner
region of the packing parts,
and in that
 the two walls are connected to one another at
least at one part of these contact points (15).
A fixed-bed reactor according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the catalytic material (3) is
provided in the form of a granulate which is a bulk-like

material.
A fixed-bed reactor according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the walls (1a, 1b) of the packing
parts are made from wire cloth. 
A fixed-bed reactor according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 the profiling of the walls (1a, 1b)
is formed by raised portions similar to hipped roofs

(11).
A fixed-bed reactor according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 the walls (1a, 1b) are wave-shaped
and are made from perforated, foil-like material,

and in that the duct-closing members at the edge of the
packing parts are formed by sealing elements (16).
A fixed-bed reactor according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that
 the upper edge of the packing parts
is sealed with connection means, in particular clamps,

which can be easily removed and replaced,
and in that at this edge the walls (1a, 1b) are flexibly

constructed so that catalyst material can be supplied or
removed through the aperture (13) formed in this manner.
A fixed-bed reactor according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the walls (1a, 1b) of the packing
parts are constructed in two layers, wherein the one

layer is made from a fluid-tight membrane permeable to
the medium and the other layer forms a stable, perforated

support structure,
and in that
 the catalyst is provided in the form of a
fluid.
Use of the fixed-bed reactor according to one of Claims
1 to 7 for a catalytic distillation process, in which a

catalytic reaction is combined with a distillation or
rectification process.
