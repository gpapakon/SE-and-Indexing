<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
the hydrogenation of acetylene components in an olefin 
production facility. The processes for converting hydrocarbons at a 
high temperature, such as, for example, steam-cracking or 
alternatively, catalytic cracking, provide unsaturated 
hydrocarbons such as, for example, ethylene, acetylene, 
propylene, butadiene, butenes, lighter compounds such as 
methane, hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons 
boiling in the gasoline range. Thus, the gaseous 
monoolefinic hydrocarbons with two or more carbon atoms, 
obtained by these processes also contain an amount of 
hydrocarbons of greater unsaturation degree. The content 
of these hydrocarbons depends on the severity of the 
conversion treatment, but is often too low to 
economically justify their separation and their use as 
such in the petrochemical field. This is often the case 
of the ethylene and propylene cuts from which acetylenes 
must be removed. To this end, the prior art is replete with a 
number of patents describing catalyst compositions for 
the selective hydrogenation of these compounds. 
Exemplary of these prior art disclosures are La Hue et 
al., United States Patent No. 3,679,762; Cosyns et al., 
United States Patent No. 4,571,442; Cosyns et al., United 
States Patent No. 4,347,392; Montgomery, United States 
Patent No. 4,128,595; Cosyns et al., United States Patent 
No. 5,059,732 and Liu et al., United States Patent No. 
4,762,956.  However, in the olefins plants of the prior 
art, the acetylene hydrogenation reactor has been located 
at the back end of the plant. Accordingly, the prior art 
processes, such as the Acetex process of the Institut 
Francais du Petrol, require an external fluid solvent and 
must carefully regulate the hydrogen ratio, carbon 
monoxide content and reactor inlet temperature due to 
pressure sensitivities to excursions in acetylene and 
carbon monoxide concentrations. Further, prior designs utilizing the acetylene 
hydrogenation reactor in the front end of the olefins 
plant have experienced operating upsets due to 
temperature excursions experienced during initial start 
up resulting from the sensitivity and activity of the 
fresh catalyst. Typically, front end units require 
multiple beds to reduce temperature rise and thus the 
chances of upsets. To this end there exists in the art a need for 
a method to hydrogenate the acetylenes in the front end 
of an olefin plant process stream and overcome the 
difficulties of the prior art processes, as discussed 
ab
