<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a disc reproducing device constructed such that a tray storing a disc can be 
loaded in and/or unloaded from a cabinet. In this disc reproducing device, a motor mounted with a disc motor and a 

turn table is constructed so as to be moved between the tray and a mechanical unit inside the cabinet. The tray has 
a pair of recessed portions as portions for holding the motor mount. The mechanical unit has as portions for holding 

the motor mount respective projecting portions of a pair of guide shafts for supporting a pick-up, a pair of lock levers, 
and a pair of guide projections. The pair of lock levers is also used as means for moving the motor mount between 

the tray and the mechanical unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disc reproducing
apparatus such as a CD player, a CD-ROM drive, an optical
magnetic disc drive, or the like.In recent years, the size and weight of disc reproducing
apparatuses such as CD players and CD-ROM drives that use
optical discs as recording mediums have been reduced. In
addition, disc reproducing apparatuses that are mounted on
computers have been developed. In conventional disc
reproducing apparatuses, a tray that holds a disc is unloaded
and loaded from and into a cabinet.Figs. 17, 18A, and 18B are schematic diagrams showing a
conventional disc reproducing apparatus.In these drawings, reference numeral 1 is a cabinet. In
the cabinet 1, a mecha-unit 2 is disposed. The mecha-unit 2
comprises an optical pickup 3, a tray 4, a turn table 12, and
a clamper 5. The pickup 3 reads record information from a
disc 10. The pickup 3 is supported by a guide shaft 13
secured to a base 6 and movable along the guide shaft 13 in
arrow directions A - B. The tray 4 is supported by guide
grooves 2a, 2a formed on both sides of the mecha-unit 2. The
tray 4 is movable along the guide grooves 2a and 2a in the
arrow directions A - B. The tray 4 can be pulled out of the
cabinet 1 in the arrow direction A for a predetermined amount. 
The clamper 5 is held by a plate 7 in such a manner that the
clamper 5 is vertically movable. A motor 11 that drives the
turn table 12 is secured to the base 6 of the pickup 3. The
turn table 12 is secured to the rotating shaft of the motor
11. A disc chuck 12a is formed on the upper surface of the
turn table 12. The disc chuck 12a fits into a center hole 10a
of the disc 10. One edge portion is rotably supported by the
main body of the mecha-unit 2 through a shaft 14. The other
edge portion of the base 6 is connected to a rotating cam 16
through a pin 15. The rotating cam 16 has a spiral groove on
the peripheral portion. The pin 15 is inserted into the
spiral groove. When the rotating cam 16 is rotated, the
position of the pin 15 varies in upper and lower directions.
When the pin 15 moves in the upper and lower directions, the
base 6 rotates in arrow directions C - D about the rotating
shaft 14. Thus, the position of the turn table 12 is switched
between a first position and a second position. At the first
position, the disc 10 is nipped by the clamper 5 and the turn
table 12. At the second position, a disc loading opening is
formed by the clamper 5 and the turn table 12.As shown in Fig. 18A, when the tray 4 is unloaded from
the cabinet 1, the base 6 is
