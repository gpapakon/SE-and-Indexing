<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a device having a computer and a sensor for monitoring a component of a motor vehicle, it is to be made possible to wait as long as possible before replacing an expensive part which is of relevance to safety and which is subject to non-negligible ageing, without impairing safety. To achieve this, the computer is designed to receive the sensor signal, which indicates the degree of load, on a continuous basis, even during periods of non-operation of the vehicle; to determine the load-dependent ageing of the part on a continuous basis from the behaviour of the measuring signal over time to compare the ageing determined with a predetermined lifetime limit for the part and to emit a warning signal, for example, when the lifetime limit is reached at the latest. This makes possible the maximum economic use of the part which is of relevance to safety, without there being a risk of unreliable operation. Suggested use: air bag system in motor vehicles.

An air bag system including a device for determining and indicating 
the temperature-relevant aging limit of an air bag system component, 

comprising a temperature sensor for sensing the temperature or 
ambient temperature of said air bag system component and an 

electronic computer, said computer being configured to continually 
receive a sensing signal of said temperature sensor, to establish 

continually from the time profile of said sensing signal a temperature-related 
aging of said air bag system component, to compare the 

established aging to a predetermined aging limit of said air bag system 
component and to output at the latest an output signal when said 

aging limit is attained. 
The air bag system as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that said 
computer is configured to receive and to process said temperature 

sensing signal also during interruptions of motor vehicle operation. 
The air bag system as set forth in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said temperature sensor is configured to sense 

the temperature or ambient temperature of the air bag material. 
The air bag system as set forth in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said computer is configured to weight and sum 

up the length of lifetime intervals of said air bag system component as 
a function of the temperature sensing signal applied in each case. 
The air bag system as set forth in claim 4, characterized in that said 
computer is configured to establish the weighting factors for said 

lifetime intervals as a function of the temperature sensing signal 
applied in each case from a characteristic curve, more particularly 

Arrhenius formula, the constants of which are held in the memory of 
the computer.  

 
The air bag system as set forth in claim 4, characterized in that said 
weighting factors for the lifetime intervals as a function of the 

temperature sensing signal are held in tabular form in the memory or 
said computer. 
The air bag system as set forth in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said computer is an on-board computer for said 

motor vehicle. 
The air bag system as set forth in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said computer is configured to output a warning 

signal at the latest when said lifetime limit is attained. 
The air bag system as set forth in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said computer is configured to output a lockout 

signal when said lifetime limit is attained, this signal restricting the 
number of subsequent starting operations of said motor vehicle and/or 

the speed thereof. 
The air bag system as set forth in any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said temperature sensor is configured to 

sense the temperature or ambient temperature of an inflator for said air 
bag.
