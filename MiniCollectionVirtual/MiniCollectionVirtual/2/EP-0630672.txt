<ABSTRACT>
A filter element of the present invention provides low 
pressure loss, superior filter performance and bonding of 

filtering material, and compactness. An inlet path (14) of a nearly 
semicircular configuration which is formed in the width 

direction of a filter element (3) is open at its upper side (71) and 
closed at its lower side (79). An outlet path (16) is closed at its upper 

side and open at its lower side. Corrugated filtering material (32) 
has continuous mountain portions (329) and valley portions (321). The 

mountain portions have a large radius of curvature R1, and the 
valley portions have a small radius of curvature R2. The valley 

portions are bonded to a flat filtering material (31,31a,31b). 
The open 

surface area of the inlet path is larger than the closed surface 
area of the outlet path (16). Preferably, R1/R2 is set so as to 

be within the range of 1.5 to 3.0.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a filter element utilized in
an oil filter, air cleaner device, fuel filter or the like.US-A-4 310 419 discloses such a filter element wherein the
mountain portions and the side portions between mountains and
valleys are flat and not circular. Therefore, the flat side
portion which separates in the inlet path and the outlet path
can easily be deformed by the pressure of the fluid acting
thereon. Further, the flat sheet portions and the corrugated
sheet portion are made by bending a single sheet. In this way
it is not possible to provide a uniform cross-sectional area
from the upstream side to the downstream side in the inlet
path.US-A-2 599 604 discloses a filter element, wherein the
corrugated sheet is provided with uniform mountain and valley
portions.EP-A-0 087 067 discloses an exhaust gas filter of honeycomb
structure comprising a belt-shaped corrugated sheet between
two flat sheets made of ceramic fiber material. Also in this
case mountain and valley portions have the same configuration.
Blockage walls are provided by pressing downwards and upwards
the edge of the corrugated sheet.DE-U-75 25 781 discloses a filter element consisting of only
one sheet of filtering material which is folded to a star-like
cross-section. As shown in FIG. 10, a filter element may use flat
filtering material 181 and corrugated filtering material 182.
In fabricating this filter element, adhesive 2a is applied in
narrow stripes along the longer direction (corrugating direction)
to the corrugated filtering material 182 on the upper side
(upstream or fuel inlet side) 71 and to the flat filtering
material 181 on the lower side (downstream or fuel outlet side)
79, respectively. Following this, the flat filtering material
181 is overlaid with the corrugated filtering material 182, and
these materials are then rolled into a spiral shape.In the above-mentioned filter element, it is not
necessary to align with care the flat filtering material 181 and
the corrugated filtering material 182 when performing rolling.
In addition, the corrugated filtering material 182 is in the
configuration most easily formed when forming with a corrugated
roller. Because of this, efficiency is good and productivity is 
good as well.However, the ratio of the open area of the fuel inlet
path 14 on the upper side 71 to the sealed area of the fuel
outlet path 16 is 1:1, and the cross-sectional configuration of
both is symmetrical. The inlet path 6 is desired to be large
enough because the fuel 6 may include contaminants
