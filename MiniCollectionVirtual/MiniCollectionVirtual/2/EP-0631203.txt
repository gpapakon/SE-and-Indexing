<ABSTRACT>
An electroconductive contact is formed of a pultruded member (18) that has a hollow 
construction. The pultruded member (18) includes a plurality of continuous electroconductive 

strands (10) embedded in a resin material (12). At least one end of the pultruded member (18) 
has laser fibrillated strands that are intended to contact a photoreceptive belt (42;Fig. 4). An 

alignment structure (32;Fig. 3) can be integrally formed during the pultrusion process on a 
surface of the p
ultruded member (18). The alignment structure aligns the pultruded member 
(18) relative to a contact. The electroconductive contact (20; Fig. 4) may also provide electrical 

connection between a photoreceptive belt (42) and a ground terminal (44).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical contacts and more particularly to pultruded
electroconductive contacts, and to methods for making the same.In a typical electrostatic reproducing machine, a photoconductive insulating surface,
often in the form of a moving belt, is uniformly charged and exposed to a light image from an
original document. The light image causes the exposed or background areas to become
discharged, and creates an electrostatic latent image on the surface corresponding to the
image contained within the original document. Alternatively, a light beam such as a laser
beam may be modulated and used to selectively discharge portions of the photoconductive
surface to record the desired information thereon. The electrostatic latent image is made
visible by developing the image with a developer powder, referred to in the art as toner, which
may be subsequently transferred to a support surface such as paper to which it may be
permanently affixed by the application of heat and/or pressure.In order to provide a return path and / or monitoring capability for charges induced
in the photoreceptor, brush contacts are generally used. Conventional photoreceptor ground
brushes include, for example, a stainless steel spring type ground brush having a bundle of
stainless steel wires or spring clips made from beryllium copper spring stock or stainless steel.
In typical electrostatic reproducing machines airborne non-conductive contaminants can be
plentiful. These non-conductive contaminants can cause contact integrity problems with the
aforementioned wire brushes and clips to the extent that electrical contact may be lost entirely.
In order to overcome some of the contamination problems, excessively high normal forces must
be applied to maintain contact. This may even require that backup plates be used to assure
pressure points. Such high forces can exacerbate failures because the high forces cause
premature wear of the electroconductive ground strip on the photoreceptor. In this respect
the metallic clips and brushes cause excessive drag forces on the photorceptor by adding to the
forces that must be overcome by the drive system components. Another type of failure
associated with conventional ground brushes is deformation of the belt timing hole, which is
typically part of the ground strip. The metal wires and clips easily cause the edges of the hole
to degrade to the point where their detection by an optical sensor is impaired, thereby causing
a system failure. The ends or sides of the stainless wire
