<ABSTRACT>
The interlockable multiple cartridge has two supply containers (2, 3) which are produced separately and can be filled, a common outlet nozzle (4) being arranged on one supply container (2), which outlet nozzle contains a separately guided channel (13; 14) for each supply container (2, 3) and the other supply container (3) has in each case an outlet channel (19) which can be inserted in the common outlet nozzle (4). Additionally, the two supply containers are releasably connected to one another at their other ends by attachment means (9).   Such an interlockable cartridge solves the problems of sealing the two outlet parts in a considerably better manner than in previously known interlockable cartridges.

other end of said storage containers being attachable 
together by fixing mea
ns, characterised in that a common 
outlet tube socket (4) is provided on one storage container 

(2), said common outlet socket having a separately 
disposed channel (13, 14) for every one of the storage 

containers (2, 3), the other storage containers (3) 
each comprising a dispensing channel (19) pluggable into 

the common outlet tube socket (4). 
Multiple cartridge according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the common outlet tube socket (4) comprises 

an outer thread (12) and at least one separation wall 
(17), one of said dispensing channels (13) being shaped

(2), the other dispensing channels (14) being arranged 

for receiving the dispensing channels (19) of the 
other storage containers (3). 
Multiple cartridge according to claim 2 or 3, characterised 
in that the outlet of said other storage containers 

(3) comprises one dispensing channel (19) only. 
Multiple cartridge according to any one of claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that said fixing means (9) comprise 

fixing parts (16, 21) at said one storage container 
(2) and said other storage containers (3) respectively, 

the fixing parts (16) at said one storage  
 

container (2) comprising two clamping holders (22) having 
a superequatorial clamping area (23) each, the two 

fixing parts (21) of the said other storage containers 
(3) comprising a cylindrical counterpiece (24) fitting 

in with said clamping holders (22). 
Multiple cartridge according to claim 4, characterised 
in that the clamping holders (22) are provided towards 

the outlet end with a flange-like end piece (26) 
and each counterpiece (24) with an end flange (25), the 

flanges (25) on said other storage containers (3) staying 
on the end pieces (26) of said one storage container 

(2) when the multiple cartridge is assembled. 
Multiple cartridge according to any one of claims 1 
to 5, characterised in that said common outlet tube 

socket (4) is closed by a closure device (6) composed of 
a stopper (7) for said one storage container (2) and a 

stopper (8) for each one of said other storage containers 
(3), the head (27) of the stopper (7) of said one 

storage container (2) being shaped for receiving the 
heads (28) of the stoppers (8) of said other storage 

containers (3). 
Multiple cartridge according to claim 6, characterised 
in that the head (27) of said one stopper (7) is
