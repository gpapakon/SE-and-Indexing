<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic control device (10) with a stop block is proposed, the check valves (11, 12) of which, designed as seat valves, can be opened mechanically in a controlled manner by a hydraulically operable release piston (13). The check valves (11, 12) and the release piston (13) are arranged coaxially in a longitudinal bore (15) in which the release piston (13) is guided with a central piston section (33) in a tight and sliding manner. At its ends remote from this piston section (33), the release piston (13) has guide webs (36, 42) with which it is guided in the longitudinal bore (15) and which in each case form a cross-section of flow for unimpeded flow through the check valves (11, 12). Despite a short type of construction, the stop block has a relatively long release piston (13) with a large guide length, as a result of which a robust and low-wear type of construction is achieved.

Hydraulic control device with at least one
hydraulically deblockable non-return valve (11, 12) which

is inserted into the connection between an engine connection
(25, 26) serving for connecting an engine (27) and

a valve connection (28, 29) serving for connecting a
directional valve (31), in which device the non-return

valve (11, 12) designed as a seat valve and an associated
hydraulically actuable deblocking piston (13, 50) are

arranged coaxially in a longitudinal bore (15) in the
housing (14), the deblocking piston (13, 50) being

sealingly and slidably guided with a piston portion (33,
51) in a cylindrical portion (32) of the longitudinal

bore (15) and separating one valve chamber (16, 17)
hydraulically from a second valve chamber (17, 16), and

with a bolt-shaped end (41) designed on the deblocking
piston (13, 50) and intended for deblocking the non-return

valve (11, 12) mechanically when the deblocking
piston (13, 50) is subjected to pressure, on its side

facing away from the non-return valve (11, 12), in the
second valve chamber (17, 16), and with a cylindrical

bore portion (34, 35) which is assigned to the non-return
valve (11, 12) and has the valve seat (21, 22) and which

is designed in the longitudinal bore (15) between an
engine chamber (18, 19) connected to the engine connection

(25, 26) and the associated valve chamber (16, 17),
characterized in that the deblocking piston (13, 50) has,

at its end (41) facing away from the piston portion (33,
51), guide webs (36, 42), by means of which it is guided

axially displaceably in the cylindrical bore portion (34, 
35) and which form a throughflow cross-section (39) which

makes an essentially unthrottled connection for the
pressure-medium stream between the engine chamber (18,

19) and the associated valve chamber (16, 17).
Control device according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the deblocking piston (13, 50) has, at its

end, a plurality of, especially three, guide webs (36,

42) which are arranged in a star-shaped manner and which
are guided with their outer cylindrical generated surface

(37) in the cylindrical bore portion (34, 35).
Control device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the guide webs (36, 42) are subdivided by

an annular groove (38), the inside diameter of which
corresponds approximately to the core diameter of the

deblocking piston (13, 50), and in that, in particular,
the axial width of the said annular groove amounts to

approximately one third of the axial length of a guide
web (36, 42).
Control device according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
in which the engine chambers and the valve chambers are

designed in the longitudinal bore by means of radial
widenings, characterized in that the axial length of the

guide webs (36, 42) is greater than the axial width of
the valve chamber (16, 17).
Control device according to one or more of Claims
1 to 4, characterized in that the longitudinal bore (15)

has an equal diameter in the region of the axial extent
of the deblocking piston (13, 50) as far as the housing-side

valve seat (21, 22).
Control device according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the non-return valve (11, 12) is

designed as a pilot-controlled valve.
Control device according to one or more of Claims
1 to 6, characterized in that the distance between the

valve bodies (23) of a non-return valve (11) and the
associated guide webs (36) is substantially smaller than

the axial extent of the cylindrical bore portion (34)
and, in particular, corresponds approximately to the

length of the bolt-shaped end (41). 
Control device acccording to one or more of
Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that it is designed as a

double-acting blocking unit (10) with two non-return
valves (11, 12) and with a deblocking piston (13, 50)

assigned to the latter.
Control device according to Claim 8, characterized
in that the deblocking piston (13) has guide webs

(36, 42) in each case at its two ends (41) and is of one-piece
design.
Control device according to Claim 8, characterized
in that the deblocking piston is of two-part design

and consists of two constructionally identical halves
(50), each half of which has a piston collar (51) guided

in the middle cylindrical portion (32).
Control device according to one or more of Claims
1 to 7, characterized in that it is designed as a single-acting

blocking unit with only one non-return valve and
with a deblocking piston (50).
