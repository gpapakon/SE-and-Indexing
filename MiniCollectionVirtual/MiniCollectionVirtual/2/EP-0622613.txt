<ABSTRACT>
An electrical capacitance instrument achieving high-volume 
productivity and a manufacturing method for the same. 

In a slide calipers detecting a change of electrical 
capacitance upon a displacement value of the slider 10 in 

relation to the base scale 1 having the main scale 20 of the 
measuring standard, the improved slide calipers is 

structured by the main scale 20 defined by plural electrodes 
21 printed on a surface of the base plate 22 made of an 

insulator film at every certain intervals with electrically 
conductive ink, and the base scale 1 made by means of an 

injection molding using a material of engineering plastics 
on which the main scale 20 is applied securely, so that the 

same preferable slide calipers can be manufactured in large 
numbers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is broadly concerned with an electrical 
capacitance instrument and a manufacturing method of the 
same and intended particularly to be used to improve a high-volume 
productivity of electrical capacitance instrument and 
a manufacturing method thereof. Conventionally, in the art of measuring instrument such 
as a slide calipers, there has been employed an electronic 
one having a digital display to prevent or decrease 
artificial mistakes when reading out measured value with the 
eye. The conventional electronic measuring instrument is 
generally defined by a main body and a measuring element 
being adapted to move in relation to the main body. The 
instant displacement value of the measuring element is 
transformed into electrical signals by an conventionally 
known electrical capacitance instrument to be displayed in 
numerical values. The electrical capacitance instrument includes a main 
scale which has a plurality of electrodes thereon arranged 
at a fixed spacing from one another and a measuring element 
which has electrodes corresponding to the electrodes 
provided on the mains scale in a statically relating state. 
The displacement value of the measuring element is 
transformed into electrical signals based on the electrical 
capacitance changed in accordance with the displacement 
value of the measuring element. Incidentally, the main scale is generally manufactured 
separately from a main body of the instrument and then  
 
secured on the main body by means of a bonding agent. However, the manufacturing process for the main scale 
does not attain a high-volume productivity due to the 
number of steps involved, that is, a step for evaporating 
metal membrane on a base plate made from epoxy-glass having 
insulation properties, a step for masking necessary area on 
the metal membrane, a step for forming plural electrodes by 
etching unnecessary area on the metal membrane, and a step 
for forming an insulation membrane to cover surface of the 
electrodes. It would therefore be difficult to achieve a 
preferable high-volume productivity of the measuring 
instrument having such a main scale even though the 
productivity of other parts except the main scale will be 
improved. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to 
provide an ideal electrical capacitance instrument in 
preferable high-volume productivity and a manufacturing 
method of the same. IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin vol. 21, no. 1, June 
1978, pages 242-243 discloses an electrical capacitance
