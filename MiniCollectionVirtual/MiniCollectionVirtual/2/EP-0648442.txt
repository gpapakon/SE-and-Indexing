<ABSTRACT>
The ring is composed of three circular arc shaped parts articulated together so as to permit their mutual pivoting in the plane of the ring. The first part (1) extends over an arc of approximately 270 DEG and each of the other two parts extends over an arc of approximately 45 DEG , thereby constituting a complete ring. Male (9) female (10) fastener elements make it possible to close the ring between the first part (1) and the third part (10). In order to open the ring, its suffices to push the articulation (7) between the second and third parts (4, 5) of the ring inwards against the elastic force exerted by the first part (1). The ring is closed by engaging the male fastener element (9) in the female element (10) while displacing the articulation (7) outwards, also against the elastic force of the first part (1). Once the ring has been closed, it is impossible to make it open by means of an outwardly directed force.
