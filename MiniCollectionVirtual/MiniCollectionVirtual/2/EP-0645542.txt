<ABSTRACT>
The motor-fan unit with a set of fan blades in which the roots of the blades are borne by a hub associated with the rotor of a motor, the stator of which bears the shaft on which the rotor turns is noteworthy in that the hub (22) comprises a core (221) with a bore and with vent holes (2212) which pass right through the core (221) and which are separated by arms, a disc (222) with a central funnel section which has openings (2222) passing right through it, which openings are separated by branches and which are surrounded by opposed veins (2224) and with a ring bearing radial fins (2226) at its periphery, and an axial annulus (223) bearing the roots (211) of the blades (21). Application to land motor vehicles for cooling their radiator.

Engine propeller fan assembly of which the blade shanks 
are borne by a hub associated with the rotor of a motor of 

which the stator bears the shaft on which the rotor turns, 
characterised in that the hub (28) which has internal and 

external faces (220) comprises a core (221) with a bore (2211) 
which is intended to receive the shaft and with vents (22l2) 

which pierce the core (221) right through and are separated by 
arms (2213), a web (222) with a central funnel (2221) which is 

pierced by inlets (2222) which are separated by branches 
(2223) and are enclosed by vanes (2224) placed on the two 

opposing internal and external faces (220) of the web and with 
a ring (2225) bearing radial fins (2226) on its periphery and 

on its internal face, and an axial rim (223) bearing the 
shanks (211) of the blades (21) on its external face. 
Assembly as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that 
the vents (2212) and the inlets (2222) are disposed in two 

concentric circles and are staggered. 
Assembly as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the fins (2226) have different axial lengths, the long 

fins and the short fins being interspersed. 
Assembly as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in that 
the fins (2226) are distributed at intervals over the ring 

(2225) and that the pitch of the long fins is greater than the 
pitch of the short fins. 
Assembly as claimed in Claim 4 in which the motor is one 
with permanent magnets, characterised in that each fin (2226) 

is delimited by two radial flanks (2227) and an axial end 
(2228), that the ends (2228) of the short fins serve as a 

longitudinal stop for the magnets and the opposing flanks 
(2227) of two successive long fins (2226) serve as an angular  

 
block for the magnets. 
Assembly as claimed in Claim 4 or 5 in which the motor 
is one with permanent magnets borne by a sheathed 

ferromagnetic yoke, characterised in that each fin (2226) is 
delimited by a peripheral edge (2229) and that these 

peripheral edges (2229) and the rim (223) together delimit a 
chamber (224) for the sheath (121) of the yoke. 
Assembly as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the bore (2211) of the core (221) is 

provided with an internal liner (2214) to receive the shaft 
(118) with at least one bearing (119) interposed. 
Assembly as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the stator (11) comprises a flange (111) 

with a central housing (116) for the shaft (118) and with 
projecting peripheral ribs (117) which serve as a radiator. 
Assembly as claimed in Claim 8. characterised in that 
the flange (11) comprises, between the housing (116) and the 

ribs (117), a seating (115) intended to receive the plates of 

the armature. 
Assembly as claimed in Claim 9, characterised in that 
the seating (115) is integral with the flange (111). 
Assembly as claimed in Claim 9, characterised in that 
the seating (115) is attached to the flange (11). 
Assembly as claimed in any one of Claims 7 to 11, 
characterised in that the liner (2214) bears a rotation 

detector (D) to control the power supply to the windings of 
the armature.
