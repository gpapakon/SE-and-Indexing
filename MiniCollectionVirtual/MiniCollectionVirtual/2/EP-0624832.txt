<ABSTRACT>
An electronic control system for a valve station of modular construction is proposed, which has a fluid distributor arrangement equipped with electrically controllable valves (19-26), the valves (19-26) being driven via at least one control module (17, 18). Furthermore, input and/or output modules (14-16) and a central electronic control unit (10) are provided, to which the individual modules (14-18) are connected for control and/or for data communication. The control unit (10) is connected to the modules (14-18) via a bus line system (28), and each module (14-18) has a programmable address decoder (29-33), means being provided for the sequential configuration of the modules (14-18) and for the automatic allocation of individual addresses for the individual modules (14-18). By this means, the valve station can be constructed or expanded in any desired way, the modules connected being automatically recognised and provided with addresses.

Electronic control unit for a valve station of modular
design, which has a fluid distributor assembly equipped with

electrically-controllable valves (19 - 26), wherein the valves
(19 - 26) are controlled by one or more control modules (17, 18),

with input and/or output modules (14 - 16) and with a central
electronic control unit (10) connectable to a field bus (11), to

which the individual modules (14 - 18) for control and/or data
communication are connected, and which has one or more

programmable address decoders (29 -33), characterized in that the
control unit (10) is connected to the modules (14 - 18) via an

internal parallel bus line system (28), that each module (14 -
18) is assigned a programmable address decoder (29 - 33), and

that means of sequential configuration of the modules (14 - 18)
and for automatic assignment of individual addresses for the

individual modules (14 - 18) in a configuration phase in the form

of an initialization phase are provided, wherein in the
configuration phase active means for sequential indexing of the

access to the individual address decoders (29 - 33) by the
control unit (10) are provided, and an address and/or address

mask is stored in the relevant address decoders (29 - 33) during
access.
Control unit according to claim 1, characterized in that the
addresses to be stored may be routed to the address decoders

(29 - 33) via an address bus (38).
Control unit according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the address decoders (29 - 33) have read/write memories for

storing the assigned addresses. 
Control unit according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that means for scanning and identification of

the respective module (14 - 18) during the access phase are
provided, wherein relevant individual module identification data

may be transmitted via a data bus (37) of the control unit (10),
and may be linked in the control unit (10) in particular with the

address assigned to the relevant module (14 - 18).
Control unit according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that means for automatic switching to an

operating phase after completion of the configuration phase are
provided and/or that the configuration phase may be initiated by

a write access to an address reserved for this purpose.
Control unit according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that each valve (19 - 26) is assigned an address

decoder or that several valves (19 - 22 and 23 - 26 respectively)
are assigned an address decoder (32 and 33 respectively), to

which an address mask and/or a suitable number of addresses are
supplied.
Control unit according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that control outputs (42) of the address

decoders (29 - 33) are connected to electrical switches (44 - 49,
54, 56) controlling the passage of input and/or output signals.
Control unit according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the central control unit (10) is designed

as a field bus station.
Control unit according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that a variable number of modules (14 - 18),

arranged in one or more rows and preferably capable of being
bolted together, may be attached to the central control unit

(10).
