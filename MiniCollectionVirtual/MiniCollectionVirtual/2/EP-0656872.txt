<ABSTRACT>
Silica sols with a high content of microgel and particles with a specific surface area within the range 300 to 700 m2/g, preferably 400 to 650 m2/g. The sols can be prepared by acidification of a water glass solution and alkalization at a certain dry content, alternatively to a certain pH. The sols are particularly suitable for use as additives in papermaking in combination with cationic polymers and especially in combination with cationic acrylamide based polymers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new silica sols 
and to the use of 
the new sols in the production of paper. More particularly the 
invention relates to new silica sols which have particles of 
a certain specific surface area and which have a comparatively 
high amount of so called microgel. The new sols are particularly 
suitable for use as additives in combination with polymers 
in the production of paper. Silica sols, which term is used herein for silica 
hydrosols, are aqueous systems with very small silica particles 
which find use in a variety of fields, among other 
things dependent on the particle size. In the production of 
paper silica based sols with very small, colloidal, anionic 
silica particles have found an increasing utilization during 
the last few years. Silica sols are hereby used as additives 
to the stock in combination with cationic or amphoteric 
polymers, mainly for improving retention and dewatering in the 
production of paper. In the European patent 41056 the use of 
colloidal silica sols in combination with cationic starch is 
for example disclosed. In the PCT applications WO 86/00100 and 
WO 86/05826 combinations of silica sols, with particles where 
at least the surface groups contain aluminium, and cationic 
natural polymers and cationic polyacrylamides, respectively, 
are disclosed. The silica particles are generally stated to 
have a specific surface area within the range of from 50 to 
1000 m²/g. The sols which are used commercially in paper 
production are of the type which have discrete colloidal 
particles with a particle size usually of from about 4 to 
about 7 nm, ie a specific surface area of from about 700 to 
about 300 m²/g, and above all sols with particles having a 
specific surface area of about 500 m²/g have been used 
commercially. It has generally been considered that sols with 
particles of the above mentioned size give the best results 
and they have also been preferred with regard to stability. 
Quite generally it has been an aim that the silica sols should 
be as monodisperse as possible, ie that the particles of the 
sols should be discrete and non-aggregated and have as narrow  
 
particle size distribution as possible. At the preparation of 
sols it has thus been sought to avoid aggregation, ie formation 
of microgel. According to the PCT application WO 
91/07350 silica sols with a certain degree of microgel 
formation have been developed. These sols are based on 
particles with a very high specific surface area and have been 
found especially
