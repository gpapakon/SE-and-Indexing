<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a process for producing a nonequilibrium 
distribution of methylamines by the catalyzed reaction of methanol and/or 

dimethyl ether with ammonia and by the catalytic reforming of a methylamine 
containing feedstock. One process selectively affords a reaction product 

enriched in mono and dimethylamines and low in trimethylamine, at high 
conversion of methanol or dimethylether. A variation of the process 

effects reforming a methylamine containing feedstock, optionally containing 
ammonia over a catalyst. The key to achieving this low TMA selectivity at 

high conversion resides in the use of a microporous zeolite, preferably 
chabazite, catalyst having a geometric selectivity index (GSI) less about 

3, a shape selectivity index (SSI) greater than about 5 and a sorption 
capacity for 1-PrOH of at least 0.5 mmol/g.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes for the preparation of 
methylamines from methanol or dimethylether and ammonia using microporous 
compositions as catalyst. The reaction of methanol and ammonia to produce methylamines, 
comprising a mixture of mono-, di- and trimethylamine, is a well known 
reaction. The reaction product is an equilibrium mixture with about 35 wt% 
of the reaction product consisting of monomethylamine (MMA) , 27 wt% 
dimethylamine (DMA), and 38 wt% trimethylamine (TMA) produced at a 
temperature of 350°C, 1 atmosphere pressure and an ammonia to methanol 
ratio (N/R) of 3.5. Substantial process efforts have been made for the 
development of processes which would alter the product slate resulting from 
the reaction of methanol and ammonia. Process variables influencing 
product slate, although limited, include space time, ammonia to methanol 
molar ratio and temperature. Product slate modifications primarily have 
been made via shape selective catalysts such as zeolites. Representative patents which illustrate various processes for the 
production of a methylamine reaction product having non equilibrium levels 
of MMA, DMA and TMA by the reaction of methanol and ammonia are as follows : U.S. 4,485,261 discloses a process for the preparation of a 
methylamine reaction product rich in DMA and lean in TMA which comprises 
introducing a mixture of methylamines and ammonia to a porous, solid acid 
catalyst comprising silica, alumina, Y and X type zeolites, thereby forming 
a first reaction product and then subjecting at least a part of the 
reaction product to a catalytic reforming reaction in the presence of  
 
ammonia and a crystalline alumino-silicate having a pore size of 3 to 8 Å. 
A variety of catalysts having a pore size of 3 to 8 Å is set forth, and 
these catalysts include clinoptilolite, erionite, mordenite, chabazite and 
various synthetic zeolites. U.S. 4,205,012 discloses a process for 
producing amines by the reaction of an alkanol with ammonia, e.g., the 
manufacture of methylamines by the reaction of methanol and ammonia in the 
presence of an FU-1 zeolite, said FU-1 zeolite having essentially all of 
the sodium cations replaced by bivalent or trivalent cations. U.S. 4,602,112 discloses a process for producing DMA in high 
selectivity by the reaction of methanol or dimethylether and ammonia in the 
presence of an acidic H-ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst. U.S. 3,384,667 discloses the alkylation of ammonia in the presence of 
a dehydrated naturally occurring crystalline
