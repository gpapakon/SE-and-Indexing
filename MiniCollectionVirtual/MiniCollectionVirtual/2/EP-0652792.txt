<ABSTRACT>
A muscle work-out device operating according to the principle of tightening spiral springs (18) actuated by pulling on straps (11). In said device, the number of spiral springs (18) may be selected by moving levers (12) to a lower position, the initial length of the straps (11) may be adjusted by means of catches (10), the straps (11) may be pulled out simultaneously or alternately, and the device may be used in the home or out of doors. When the device is used in the home, the straps (4) are first placed between a door and its frame, and when it is used out of doors, the straps (3) are first passed around a tree or pillar, then tightened and joined by means of clasps (6).

Muscle work-out device intended for home use or for outdoors applications owing to 
casing with superposed straps, which operates based on the principle of tightening spiral 

springs actuated by pulling the pull straps, the device being provided with a system for 
determining the number of spiral springs to be tightened, and comprising casing (1) divided 

into two equal compartments in which are disposed, independently of each other, two axles 
(19) to which are connected by one their ends the first spiral springs (24) by means of rivets 

(20), and with the other ends they are attached to the projections (23) situated on the internal 
walls of the casing (1), and these first spiral springs (24) serve only for rolling up the pull 

straps (11) around the axles (19) when adjust the initial length of the pull straps (11) wound 
around axles (19) and extending into the handgrips outside casing (1) allowing, when the 

handgrips are pulled outward, axles (19) to be rotated and communicate their rotation to other 
spiral springs (18) installed in toothed wheels (17) that are not joined to axles (19), but which 

provide support to spiral springs (18) during their tightening by their projections (21) to which 
are attached the other ends of spiral springs (18), caused by rotation of axles (19) and blocked 

rotation of toothed wheels (17) and other spiral springs (18) owing to levers (12) and buttons 
(15) of the unit, but which will be accomplished when user pulls down levers (12) into their 

lower position, there by pushing buttons (15) into position between two teeth of the toothed 
wheel (17), and in this way, by lowering a determined number of levers (12), user selects the 

number of other spiral springs (18) he wants to tension. 
Device per claim 1 characterized by that it is provided with the first set of openings (13) 
in the front wall of casing (1) to accommodate levers (12) connected to the front wall of 

casing (1) by means of a joint (16), the ends of which that are in contact with buttons (15) 
have a semi-spherical shape so as to be able to push the buttons (15) easier toward the points 

situated between teeth of the toothed wheel (17), while the head of buttons (15) have at 
their rear portion inclined surfaces which permit the levers (12) to push the buttons (15), with 

the head of buttons (15) providing supporting to spring (14) located around the body of button 
(15) serving to hold button (15) away from toothed wheel (17). 
Device per claim 1 characterized by another set of openings (9) provided in the front 
wall of casing (1) allowing pull straps (11) to pass through the casing (1), and by catches (10) 

through which pull straps (11) are passed and that exert pressure on pull straps (11) and are 
held against the front wall of casing (1) preventing the initially selected length of pull straps 

(11) to change. 
Device per claim 1 characterized by ball bearings (25) fitted at the ends of axles (19) 
provided to avoid friction between axles (19) and casing walls.  

 
Device per claim 1 characterized by flanges (22) installed on axles (19) adjacent to the 
sides of pull straps (11) to ensure proper winding of pull straps (11) around axles (19). 
Device per claim 1 characterized by a bar (8) fitted through the rear part of casing (1) to 
carry casing (1) during use, and which is joined with connecting straps (4) to another bar (7), 

allowing the device to be used indoors, where as the second bar (7) is joined with another set 
of straps (5) to superposed straps (3) provided with clasps (6) allowing these superposed straps 

(3) to be placed around a tree or some other stable post.
