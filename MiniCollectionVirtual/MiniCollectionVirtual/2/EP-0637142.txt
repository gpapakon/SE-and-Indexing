<ABSTRACT>
A cellular communications network (116) includes 
satellites (400) which project cells (200) toward the earth 

(104). The satellites (400) and cells (200) move relative to 
the earth (104). When a call is being set up (604) to a 

subscriber unit (300), data describing the subscriber unit's 
location are sent (702) to a switching office (500) of the 

network (116). The switching office (500) generates a 
schedule (800) which forecasts when movement of the cells 

(200) will cause the subscriber unit (300) to cross cell 
boundaries. During an ongoing call (606), the subscriber unit 

(300) determines (916) when scheduled boundary crossings 
occur. So long as an adequate signal is present (1108) in a 

scheduled cell (200) and network capacity exists (1204) in 
the scheduled cell (200) to handle the call, the call will be 

handed off (1206, 1208) to the scheduled cell (200). The 
subscriber unit (300) also monitors signal strengths to 

determine when a traffic channel's signal is getting weak 
(904) and when an alternate cell's signal is stronger (908).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to cellular 
communications systems. More specifically, the present 
invention relates to handing off communications between the 
cells of a cellular communications system. A cellular communications system projects any number 
of cells over the earth at diverse locations. A frequency 
spectrum is then allocated in frequency, in time, by coding, or 
a combination of these, to the cells so that communications 
taking place in nearby cells use different channels to 
minimize the chances of interference. On the other hand, 
communications taking place in cells located far apart may 
use the same channels, and the large distance between 
communications in common channels prevents interference. 
Over a large pattern of cells, a frequency spectrum is reused 
as much as possible by distributing common channels over the 
entire pattern so that only far apart cells reuse the same 
spectrum. An efficient use of spectrum results without 
interference. One problem which cellular communications systems 
address is the handing off of communications between cells. 
Relative movement between end users and cells causes the 
end users and the communication links directed thereto to 
move between cells. In order to permit continuous 
communications in an ongoing call, the system must "handoff" 
the call when the end user crosses a cell boundary. If a call is 
not handed off to a new cell upon leaving an old cell, the call 
will eventually be lost because the strength of signals over  
 
which communications take place would diminish to a point 
where the system's radio equipment cannot receive the end 
user's transmissions, or vice versa. Conventional cellular communications systems address 
the handoff problem by monitoring and comparing signal 
strength. A currently used channel associated with one cell 
may be monitored and compared with a channel associated 
with another cell. This type of monitoring may be performed 
by a subscriber unit. Alternatively, a currently used channel 
may be monitored from locations in two different cells, and 
the results of this monitoring compared. This type of 
monitoring may be performed by system equipment located in 
diverse cells. Communications are then passed off to the cell 
with the stronger signal. The conventional handoff technique may work adequately 
when the distances between subscriber units and system 
transceivers are relatively small, when the speeds of 
movement between cells and subscriber units are slow, and 
when handoffs are
