<ABSTRACT>
A gray balance correcting method in which the deterioration of 
color balance correcting capacity can be avoided for an image 

photographed under different kinds of light sources, such that the 
influence of failure can be eliminated. An image recorded on a 

negative film is divided into a large number of regions. Density 
values of C, M and Y in the respective regions are measured. 

Maximum and minimum reference values for the C, M and Y colors are 
calculated based on the measured density values D. Then, 

conversion correlation coefficients, for the respective colors, are 
calculated to make values, after conversion of the reference values 

of the respective colors, coincident with D
max
 and coincident with 
D
min
. The measured density values of C, M and Y are converted by 
using the conversion correlations determined from the calculated 

coefficients. In another embodiment, only maximum values are used 
as reference values. In yet another embodiment, the converted 

measured density values are plotted on color coordinates. Then, 
averages in a predetermined region S containing a line L passing 

through the maximum and minimum converted reference values, D
max
 
and D
min
, are calculated based on the distribution plotted on the 
color coordinates. Conversion correlations of the respective 

colors are corrected according to curves of secondary degree P
C
 and 
P
Y
 passing through D
max
, D
min
 and the average of the density values. 
The C, M and Y measured values are then converted again by using 

the corrected conversion correlations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gray balance correcting
method for correcting the gray balance of an image recorded on a
negative film.An image recorded on a color negative film is pervious to
three colors of light; namely, B (blue), G (green) and R (red). It
is known, experimentally, that the transmission ratio of the three
colors is generally, substantially equal or predetermined (Evans
theory). Therefore, in most photographic printers, the exposure
condition is determined on the basis of the following equation
called an integral neutral method:
log Ej = Kj + Aj • Dj
in which log Ej represents a logarithm of exposure, Kj represents
a constant based on a photosensitive material, a photographic
printer, etc., Dj represents an accumulated transmission density of
the image (LATD), Aj represents a correction coefficient, and j
represents a color (R, G or B) of light. According to the
aforementioned equation (1), for example, the exposure of R is set
large for an image with a small amount of transmitted light (high
in the accumulated transmission density of R), so that the total
amount of each of the R, G and B light radiated onto print paper,
through a negative film, is made coincident with each other when
printing on the print paper is based on the exposure calculated as
described above. Accordingly, the accumulated density values of R,
G and B in an image printed on the print paper are made constant so
that the gray balance is maintained over the entire image.In the case of a negative film, the densities of R, G and B,
which develop Magenta (M), Yellow (Y) and Cyan (C), respectively, 
theoretically change with a constant difference in density, as
shown in Fig. 1(A), when the amount of exposure changes at the time
of photographing. In the aforementioned integral neutral method,
when, for example, accumulated transmission densities are M0, Y0 and
C0, exposure is determined to make these coincident with each
other. Accordingly, exposure can be determined, theoretically, to
make the density change characteristics of the respective colors
coincident with each other, so that gray balance ought to be
maintained within a range between the minimum density and the
maximum density in the printed image. The abscissa of Fig. 1 shows
the exposure quantity in log scale.In practice, however, the density change characteristics of
the respective colors in the negative film are affected by
processing conditions such as development, etc., so that the slopes
of the curves of the density change characteristics are
