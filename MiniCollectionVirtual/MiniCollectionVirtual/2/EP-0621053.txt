<ABSTRACT>
A female luer connector comprises a tube (11) having 
an open, outer end (12) in a luer-tapered bore (14) communicating 

with the outer end (12). The tube (11) carries a side arm (32) that 
extends from a position spaced longitudinally from the open, 

outer end (12), with the side arm (32) extending both radially 
outwardly from the tube (11) and in generally longitudinal 

relationship with the axis (38) of the bore toward the open, 
outer end (12), to define a space (56) between the tube (11) and the 

side arm (32) for receiving an outer, threaded sleeve (18) of a 
male luer lock connector (16). A cap (42) is connected to the side 

arm (32) through a plastic hinge (44) in a position permitting the 
cap (42) to pivot between a closed position in which the cap (42) 

closes the open, outer end (12), and an open position in which 
the cap (42) is spaced from the open, outer end (12). The side arm (32) 

defines an effectively rigid, fixed configuration to 
position the hinge (44) and cap (42) to naturally and spontaneously 

permit pivoting to the closed position to the open 
position, typically upon pressing with a single finger.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a luer connector encompassing the
features of the pre-characterizing clause of claim 1.Luer connectors are well-known and used in a wide variety of
medical sets and the like, in which a tapered sleeve or nozzle
fits into a tapered socket to provide a tight connection.
Typically, the luer connector complies with ISO/ANSI specifications.Often, a "luer-lock" connector is used, in which the conventional
luer connection is reinforced with an outer sleeve
carried on one of the connectors, typically the male connector,
which sleeve engages outwardly extending projections of
the female luer connector in threaded, interlocking relation,
to provide assurance that the luer connection does not accidentally
separate.Such luer connectors and luer lock connectors come in a wide
variety of designs, and are used as connectors for parenteral
solution sets for dialysis and other procedures, connectors
for joining hypodermic needles and needle hubs, and the like.Female luer connectors in the prior art originally had separate
closure caps. Such a design is 
of course relatively costly to mold and assemble, there
being two separate parts, and often the caps would be
lost or would fall on the floor.Then, as a next step in the prior art, female
luer connectors were molded with integral caps attached
by a hinge. However, these connectors were not suitable
for mating with male luer lock connectors, because the
inside threaded skirt of the typical male luer lock
connector would often be impeded by the hinge.As another developmental step, luer connectors
were provided in which the cap is attached by an
umbilical cord-like strap which connects to the female
connector at a position that is spaced from the open end
thereof. Problems with the system included the fact that
when the connector is uncapped, the cap is free to move
in any direction that its flexible cord permits. Thus,
due to the flexibility of such an umbilical cord-like
strap, this system is ill suited for automated capping,
and thus requires manual labor to initially place the cap
on the end of the connector after molding. Also, when
the user has removed the cap and desires to recap it, the
recapping is not easily done with a single finger of the
same hand holding the connector, but rather more often
requires closer attention and grasping of the cap with
the thumb and forefinger of the other hand to properly
position the cap for recapping on the luer. Similar to the above luer connectors in which the cap is attached
by an umbilical cord-like

<CLAIMS>
A luer connector which comprises a tube (11, 63) having
an open, outer end (12, 74) and a luer-tapered bore (14,

62) communicating with said outer end; a cap (42,82)
attached to said tube (11, 63) via hinge means

(44,80) radially spaced from the open, outer end (12, 74)
permitting said cap (42, 82) to pivot between a closed position in

which the cap closes said open, outer end (12, 74) and an open
position in which said cap (42, 82) is spaced from said open,

outer end (12, 74),
characterized in that
 the luer connector further comprises
a side arm (32, 70) which is attached to said tube

(11) at a position longitudinally spaced from the open
outer end, said side arm (32, 70) extends from said

position radially outwardly from said tube (11, 63) and also
extends in generally longitudinal relationship (36) with

the axis (38) of said bore (14, 62) toward said open, outer end
(12, 74),

to define a space (56, 76) between said tube (11, 63) and
said side arm (32,70); the cap (42, 82) being connected

to said side arm by said hinge means (44, 80), said side
arm (32,70) defining an effectively rigid, fixed configuration

to position said hinge means (44, 80) and cap (42, 82) to naturally and
spontane
ously permit pivoting of said closed position
from the open position upon pressing with a single finger. 
The luer connector of claim 1 in which said side arm (32, 70)
comprises a band extending in said radially outwardly and

generally longitudinal relationship said band having a
width (48) at least twice the thickness (50) of said band, said

thickness (50) being measured in the radial direction relative
to said tube (11, 63). 
The luer connector of claim 2 in which radial fin means
(78) extend outwardly from said tube (63) into connection with

said band at a portion of said side arm (70) which is longitudinally
spaced from the bore open outer end (62). 
The luer connector of the previous claims in which said
cap (42) defines a projection (46) extending outwardly from a

said cap (42), said projection (46) being connected to said hinge
means (44).
The luer connector of the previous claims in which a
handle (54) projects outwardly from said cap (42), to

facilitate opening of the cap (42) out of the closed position
with a single finger.
The luer connector of the previous claims in which said
side arm (32, 70) connects with said tube (11, 63) at a position that is

essentially 4 to 20 mm. from said open, outer end (12, 74). 
The luer connector of the previous claims in which said
tube (11) defines outwardly protruding means (20) at its

open outer end (12) for engaging a threaded sleeve (18)
of a male luer lock connector (16).
The luer connector of the previous claims which is
an integrally molded plastic piece, said tube (11) having an

open end (22) opposed to said open, outer end (12) which
is positionable on a male luer connector. 
The luer connector according to any of the previous
claims,
characterized
 in that the hinge means (44) is substantially in
the plane of the open outer end (12) of the connector.
