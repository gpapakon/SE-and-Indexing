<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pick-up coil 
assembly for a magnetic gradiometer using a plurality of superconducting 
quantum interference devices (SQUID's). A SQUID is widely used for detecting a weak 
magnetic field with very high sensitivity. That is, a 
SQUID can respond to a change in a weak magnetic field 
based on a quantum interference effect of the magnetic 
field. Accordingly, a SQUID is mainly utilized for, 
particularly, a high sensitivity gradiometer having a pick-up 
coil assembly as a magnetic sensor. A SQUID gradiometer 
is utilized, for example, in the medical equipment field to 
measure the weak magnetic field generated by the heart of 
a human body. A detecting stage of a digital SQUID magnetometer 
(see Fig. 13) may be constituted by a superconductive pick-up 
coil for detecting a weak magnetic field from an object 
(human body), a superconductive input coil provided in the 
SQUID and magnetically coupled to the pick-up coil, and a 
superconductive feedback coil magnetically coupled to these 
coils. In general, the pick-up coil assembly is 
constituted by a plurality of coils (multi-channel), each 
coil corresponding to one channel, since it is necessary to 
simultaneously detect the magnetic field over a wide area 
on the object. For example, about 36 individual pick-up 
coils are necessary for diagnosing the heart. In this case, since the pick-up coil assembly 
must detect a very weak magnetic field without dispersion  
 
of characteristics among pick-up coils, it is necessary to 
assemble the pick-up coil assembly with very high 
precision, particularly structural precision, so as to have 
high uniformity among coils. EP-A-0 130 490 discloses a pick-up coil assembly 
for a multi-channel SQUID gradiometer according to the 
preamble of each of the accompanying independent claims. EP-A-0 200 958 discloses a multi-channel second 
order SQUID gradiometer with pick-up coils arranged in 
three flat or curved planes. According to a first aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a pick-up coil assembly for a 
multi-channel SQUID magnetic gradiometer, comprising: 
an upper and a lower support plate, and a plurality of 
pick-up coils and connection pads provided on the support 
plates, the pick-up coils and the connection pads being 
formed by a lithography technique; and superconductive connections for connecting respective 
pick-up coils of the upper support plate with 
corresponding pick-up coils of the lower support plate so 
as to form first order gradiometers;
