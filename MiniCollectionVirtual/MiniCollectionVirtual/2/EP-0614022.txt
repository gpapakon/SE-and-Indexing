<ABSTRACT>
An electromagnetic clutch in which an annulus 60 
of sound damping material is sandwiched between an 

armature disc 51 and a backing ring 62. The annulus 60 
and the backing ring 62 coact to define a constrained-layer 

damping system for reducing noise when the 
armature disc 51 is snapped into engagement with the 

rotor 22 of the clutch and also during steady state 
operation of the clutch.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an armature 
assembly for a selectively engageable and disengageable 
coupling such as an electromagnetic clutch or brake. Newton United States Patent 4,493,407 discloses a 
typical electromagnetic clutch in which a slotted armature 
disc is connected to a driven hub by a mounting 
plate and is adapted to be attracted into engagement with 
a driving rotor when an electromagnet is energized. The 
armature disc is connected to the mounting plate by a 
series of leaf springs which couple the armature disc and 
the mounting plate for rotation in unison while allowing 
the armature disc to move toward and away from the rotor 
when the electromagnet is energized and de-energized. Another type of armature assembly is disclosed in 
Booth United States Patent 5,150,779. In that armature 
assembly, a resiliently yieldable plastic web acts to 
connect a low magnetic reluctance armature disc for rotation 
with the driven hub. The web flexes axially in 
order to permit the armature disc to move toward and away 
from the rotor when the clutch is engaged and disengaged. Impact noise is produced when the armature disc is 
initially snapped into engagement with the rotor. Noise 
also is produced by vibration which occurs during steady 
state operation of the clutch. The present invention seeks to provide 
a new and improved armature assembly in which the 
level of noise produced both during initial engagement of 
the armature and during steady state operation is reduced 
significantly. More particularly the invention seeks to 
achieve the foregoing by providing an armature assembly 
which incorporates constrained-layer damping techniques  
 
so as to increase the ability of sound damping material 
to effectively reduce noise. US-A-4493407 discloses an armature assembly for a 
selectively engageable and disengageable 
electromagnetic coupling, said armature assembly 
comprising a generally circular armature disc made of 
material having low magnetic reluctance, said armature 
disc having at least one circumferentially extending 
row of circumferentially spaced slots formed 
therethrough, a backing ring spaced axially from said 
armature disc and an annulus of compressible sound 
damping material. According to the present invention the annulus is 
sandwiched between said armature disc and said backing 
ring, and means are provided for securing said armature 
disc and said backing ring to one another while placing 
said annulus in axial compression between said disc and 
said ring
