<ABSTRACT>
The leader (2) attached to a web of film (F) is cut from the 
film (F) while processing the film (F) in a photographic processing 

machine. Before feeding the film to the printing unit, the 
leader is separated from the film. At a turning point 

where the film feed direction extending from the film 
drying unit to the printing unit changes, the film is fed 

straight ahead and the leader is cut off the film by a 
cutter (41). The film is fed back in a reverse direction and 

its end is turned up by a guide (43). When the printing unit 

gets vacant, the film without the leader is fed into the 
printing unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a photographic processing
machine for automatically developing and drying film,
printing images on the films onto photographic paper, and
developing and drying the photographic paper.As shown in Fig. 16, this type of photographic
processing machine has a film developing unit A comprising
a plurality of treating tanks, a film drying unit B, a
printing unit C, a printed paper developing unit D having a
plurality of processing tanks, and a printed paper drying
unit E. Films F are fed through the units A, B and C. Web
of photographic paper P is fed through the units C, D and
E. While feeding films and photographic paper, the films
are developed and dried and the images thereon are printed
onto the photographic paper. The thus printed photographic
paper is developed and dried. These steps are all carried
out automatically. The numerals used in Fig. 16 refer to
the same elements shown in the other figures showing the
embodiments of this invention. Thus, these elements are
described in more detail in the description of the
embodiments.Since the images on the undeveloped films are not
fixed, it is preferable to keep them out of contact with 
the film feed rollers where possible. To feed films
stably, a leader should be attached to the leading end of
each film. Thus, as shown in Fig. 15, it is an ordinary
practice to attach (bond) a leader L to the leading end of
a film F. The film is fed through the film developing unit
A and the film drying unit B with its side edges guided by
the guides while having the leader L sandwiched between the
feed rollers.In the photographic art, the film developing unit A
and film drying unit B are usually referred to
comprehensively as a film processor, while the printing
unit C, printed paper developing unit D and printed paper
drying unit E are comprehensively called a printer
processor.Although it is a convenient way to feed a film F
guided by a leader L in the film processor, it is
difficult, considering the structure of the film printing
unit C, to feed the film F through the unit C (into the
feed path in the negative mask 14) with the leader L
attached thereto. Thus, as shown in Fig. 16, it was
heretofore necessary to provide the film processor
including the film developing unit A separately from the
printer processor including the printing unit C in order to
separate a leader L from every film F fed out of the film
processor by peeling off an adhesive tape t or by cutting 
the film F leading end along the chain line and then to
insert by hand the

<CLAIMS>
A method of processing a photographic film in a photographic processing machine of the type including a
film developing unit (A), a film drying unit (B), a printing unit (C),

a photographic paper developing unit (D) and a photographic
paper drying unit (E) that are arranged continuously,

said method comprising
the steps of feeding the film with a leader (L) attached to the

leading end thereof through the film developing unit and
the film drying unit to develop and dry the film,

separating the leader from the film, feeding the film into
the printing unit, and feeding photographic paper (P) through

the printing unit, the photographic paper developing unit
and the photographic paper drying unit to print images of

the film onto the photographic paper and to develop and dry
the photographic paper,

   characterized by feeding the film with the leader
until a position at which the leader and a part of the film protrude from a turning point where the film feed

direction in the film feed path extending from the film
drying unit to the printing unit changes, stopping the feed

of the film with the leader at said position, cutting
off the leader from the film, moving the film backwards

until its leading end comes back to the turning point, and
feeding the film along the film feed path leading to the

printing unit into the printing unit. 
A photographic processing machine comprising a film
developing unit (A), a film drying unit (B), a printing unit (C), a

photographic paper developing unit (D) and a photographic paper
drying unit (E) that are arranged continuously, wherein a film (F)

having a leader attached to the leading end thereof is fed
through the film developing unit and the film drying unit

to develop and dry the film wherein the leader is separated from the film, the film is fed into the printing unit, and wherein photographic paper
is fed through the printing unit, photographic paper

developing unit and photographic paper drying unit to print
images of the film onto the photographic paper and to

develop and dry the photographic paper,

   characterized in that the film feed path extending
from said film drying unit to said printing unit has a

turning point at which its direction is changed, and that
said processing machine further comprises a roller (12c) provided

at said turning point for feeding the film back and forth,
a guide provided (43) at said turning point for selectively

feeding the film straight ahead or toward the printing

unit, and a cutter (41) provided downstream of said guide for
cutting off the leader.
A photographic processing machine as claimed in claim
2 further comprising film storing units (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) in which the film can

be stored in the form of length-adjustable loops.
