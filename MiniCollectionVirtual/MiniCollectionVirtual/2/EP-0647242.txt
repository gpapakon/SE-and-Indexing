<ABSTRACT>
A laminating resin comprising (A) an acrylated or methacrylated cycloaliphatic epoxide, (B) an acrylated or methacrylated alkoxylated bisphenol-A, in a weight ratio of (A) to (B) of about 3 to 1 to about 1 to 5, and (C) about 5 % to about 50 %, based on the total composition, cyclohexyl methacrylate. Vinyl toluene and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate are also used to modify certain properties of the resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to resin 
compositions which cure as they are shaped, 
laminated, brushed, sprayed or otherwise placed into 
the space where they are to form a product; such 
resins are broadly known as laminating resins, 
commonly have an unsaturated polyester resin base, 
and nearly always are employed in a solution of an 
organic monomer such as styrene. The organic 
monomer is intended to copolymerize with the resin 
but typically and notoriously may also tend to 
volatilize in significant amounts into the workplace 
environment. The present invention employs a vinyl 
ester resin rather than a conventional unsaturated 
polyester, in combination with a particular 
crosslinking agent. It can be used in existing 
equipment, procedures, and workplaces, but emits far 
less monomer than the typical laminating resin 
heretofore. Many attempts have been made to devise 
laminating resins having low volatile emissions and 
still meet the physical specifications and other 
desirable properties of the end products, while 
remaining relatively easy to use. In Lee U.S. Patent 
4,465,806, for example, a more or less conventional  
 
unsaturated polyester resin is combined with, 
instead of the usual styrene, a reaction product of 
a polyepoxy compound and acrylic or methacrylic acid 
which may be the diacrylate of a polyglycidyl ether 
of bisphenol-A. Cycloaliphatic epoxides are well known. 
They have been reacted with various other materials 
and used in various environments. See the bulletin 
on cycloaliphatic epoxide systems published by Union 
Carbide Corporation. The reaction product of such 
materials with acrylic acid or methacrylic acid are 
not well known, and although aliphatic epoxys are 
enumerated as potential ingredients in some vinyl 
ester resin patents, they are not demonstrated in 
any nor are they mentioned as a possible use for 
cycloaliphatic epoxy resins in any of Union 
Carbide's (the manufacturer) literature. Further, 
when we formed these vinyl ester resins we found it 
necessary to depart radically from the accepted 
ratio of one monounsaturated acid per unreacted 
epoxy group to a preferred ratio of one 
monounsaturated acid per 1.6 epoxy groups. This 
indicated a different chemistry from that found in 
forming BPA epoxy vinyl ester resins. Ethoxylated, difunctional, bisphenol-A has 
been used in the past as an ingredient in various 
types of resins, generally resins which include a 
significant diisocyanate component, as in Ford, Jr. 
et al U.S. Patent 3,876,726. However, we are
