<ABSTRACT>
The number (S) of erase cycles in addressed blocks are counted 
and compared with a preset number. The addressed block is 

replaced if the preset number is reached. Furthermore, an 
intelligent erase algorithm is provided to get an increased life 

of the memory.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of using a memory
system and to a memory system having safety features.An electrically programmable read only memory
(Eprom) utilizes a floating (unconnected) conductive gate,
in a field effect transistor structure, positioned over but
insulated from a channel region in a semiconductor
substrate, between source and drain regions. A control gate
is then provided over the floating gate, but also insulated
therefrom. The threshold voltage characteristic of the
transistor is controlled by the amount of charge that is
retained on the floating gate.The memory cell transistor's state is read by
placing an operating voltage across its source and drain and
on its control gate, and then detecting the level of current
flowing between the source and drain as to whether the
device is programmed to be "on" or "off" at the control gate
voltage selected. A specific, single cell in a two-dimensional
array of Eprom cells is addressed for reading by
application of a source-drain voltage to source and drain
lines in a column containing the cell being addressed, and
application of a control gate voltage to the control gates
in a row containing the cell being addressed.In addition to the floating and control gates, an
erase gate is included. The erase gate passes through each
memory cell transistor closely adjacent to a surface of the
floating gate but insulated therefrom by a thin tunnel
dielectric. Charge is then removed from the floating gate of
a cell to the erase gate, when appropriate voltages are
applied to all the transistor elements. An array of EEprom
cells are generally referred to as a Flash EEprom array if
an entire array of cells, or a significant group of cells,
is erased simultaneously (i.e. in a flash). EEproms have been found to have a limited effective
life. The number of cycles of programming and erasing that
such a device can endure before becoming degraded is finite.
After a number of such cycles in excess of 10,000, depending
upon its specific structure, its programmability can be
reduced. Often, by the time the device has been put through
such a cycle for over 100,000 times, it can no longer be
programmed or erased properly. This is believed to be the
result of electrons being trapped in the dielectric each time
charge is transferred to or away from the floating gate by
programming or erasing, respectively.It is already known to use several EEproms in a momory
system and have a separate EEprom for storing erasing and
writing frequencies carried out by the center
