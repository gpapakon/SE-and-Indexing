<ABSTRACT>
A detector for periodically detecting the pile height of a feed pile (1) of a paper sheet processing machine, in particular a printing machine, having a lever drive mechanism with a scanning roll which is in constant contact, by means of a spring, with a drive cam which can be driven cyclically at least during the paper run, having a four-bar guide mechanism with two levers (14, 16, 18, 22) which are arranged one above the other, are mounted in each case with one lever end in an articulated manner on the frame, and are mounted in each case with their other lever end in an articulated manner on a coupler (20), spaced apart, a detector foot (8) being attached to a downwardly extending, vertical continuation of the coupler (20) to detect the pile height, having a carrier stop which is attached to the drive mechanism, having a stop surface (31) on the guide mechanism, which stop surface is arranged and designed to correspond to the carrier stop for the periodical production of a contact to raise the detector foot (8), and having a spring whose one spring bearing is attached fixedly to the machine and whose other spring bearing is attached to the guide mechanism and whose spring force presses the stop surface (31) in the direction towards the carrier stop.

<CLAIMS>
Sensor for the cyclic sensing of the stack height 
of a feed stack of a paper sheet-processing machine, 

especially a printing machine, 

having a lever drive linkage (22, 20, 18) with a 
sensor roller (24), which is in constant touching 

contact by means of a spring (27) with a cyclically 
drivable drive curve (25), at least during 

the running of the paper, 
having a four-bar guiding linkage with two levers 
(14, 16) arranged one above the other and supported 

in an articulated fashion in each case 
with one lever end on the frame, the said levers 

each being supported in an articulated fashion, 
separated from each other, with their other lever 

end on a coupling (11), a sensing foot (8) for 
sensing the stack height being fastened on a 

vertical extension of the coupling (11) reaching 
downwards, 
having a driver stop (30) which is fastened on 
the drive linkage (22, 20, 18), 
having a stop surface (31) to the driver stop 
(30) for the cyclic production of a touching 

contact for lifting the sensing foot (8) 
correspondingly designed and arranged on the 

guiding linkage and 
having a spring (28) of which one spring hanger 
is fastened fixed to the machine and of which the 

other spring hanger is fastened on the guiding 
linkage and whose spring force presses the stop 

surface (31) in the direction towards the driver  
 

stop (30). 
Sensor for the cyclic sensing of the stack height 
of a feed stack of a paper sheet-processing machine, 

especially a printing machine, according to the features 
of Claim 1, 


in which the driver stop (30) is supported so as 
to be able to pivot about a machine-fixed pivot 

point (17) of one (16) of the two levers (14, 16) 
of the guiding linkage. 
Sensor for the cyclic sensing of the stack height 
of a feed stack of a paper sheet-processing machine, 

especially a printing machine, according to the features 
of Claim 2, 


in which the spring hanger (28) fastened on the 
guiding linkage is arranged on the other (14) of 

the two levers (14, 16) of the guiding linkage. 
Sensor for the cyclic sensing of the stack height 
of a feed stack of a paper sheet-processing machine, 

especially a printing machine, according to the features 
of Claim 1, 


in which the lever drive linkage is a four-bar 
drive linkage, 
in which two levers (22, 18) are in each case 
supported with one end of a lever arm about a 

machine-fixed pivot point (23, 17) and 
in which these two levers (22, 18) are articulated 
with the other end on a common coupling 

(20), spaced from each other, 
in which the machine-fixed pivot point (17) of a 
first (18) of the two levers (22, 18) is the 

machine-fixed pivot point (17) of a first (16) of 
the two levers (14, 16) of the guiding linkage, 

the driving stop (30) being arranged on this 
first lever (18) of the drive linkage and the 

corresponding stop surface (31) being arranged on 
this first lever (16) of the guiding linkage. 
Sensor for the cyclic sensing of the stack height 
of a feed stack of a paper sheet-processing machine, 

especially a printing machine, according to the features  
 

of Claim 4, 

in which the sensing roller (24) is supported 
rotatably on the second (22) of the two levers 

(22, 18) of the four-bar drive linkage. 
Sensor for the cyclic sensing of the stack height 
of a feed stack of a paper sheet-processing machine, 

especially a printing machine, according to the features 
of Claim 1, 


in which there is formed on the guiding linkage 
a sensing surface (33) which is changed in its 

position as a function of the height position of 
the sensing foot, 
having a machine-fixed sensor device (34) for 
determining the position of this sensing surface 

(33), which is connected with an evaluating and 
control device for following the stack height.
