<ABSTRACT>
Process of imparting conductivity to a three-dimensional 
net-shaped porous sheet can be performed efficiently 

before carrying out electroplating process. Fine 
metallic powders are applied to the porous sheet made of a 

foamed sheet, a nonwoven sheet, a mesh sheet or a plurality 
of sheets layered one on the other, so that a conductive 

metallic layer is formed on the porous sheet. Then, an 
electroplated layer is formed on the surface of the conductive 

metallic layer. The conductive metallic layer remains 
when the porous sheet burned out. Consequently, a metallic 

layer of the conductive metallic layer and the electroplated 
layer forms the metallic framework of the metallic 

porous sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metallic 
porous sheet and a method of manufacturing the metallic 
porous sheet, and more particularly, to a method of manufacturing 
a metallic porous sheet by using a three-dimensional 
net-shaped porous sheet consisting of a foamed 
sheet, a nonwoven sheet, a mesh sheet or a plurality of 
sheets layered one on the other by combining at least two 
of the above three types of sheets with each other. The 
metallic porous sheet is used as an electrode plate of a 
nickel cadmium battery, a nickel hydrogen battery, a 
lithium battery, a fuel battery or a battery plate for use 
in a car by charging activating powders into pores of the 
metallic porous sheet. The present applicant proposed metallic porous 
sheets to be used as an electrode plate of a battery. The 
proposed porous sheet consists of a foamed sheet, a 
nonwoven sheet, a mesh sheet or a plurality of sheets 
layered one on the other by combining at least two of the 
above three types of sheets with each other. The porous 
sheet is formed into a metallic porous sheet by electroplating 
(Japanese Laid-Open Patent publication Nos. 1-290792 
and 3-130393).  If the foamed material, the nonwoven sheet or the 
mesh sheet to be used as the base material of the metallic 
porous sheet consists of an organic substance such as 
synthetic resin, natural fiber, cellulose, paper or the 
like; or an inorganic substance such as glass or the like, 
it is necessary to impart conductivity to the base material. 
It is preferable to impart conductivity to the base 
material even though the base material is made of metal. As methods of imparting conductivity to the base 
material, carbon is applied to the surface of the base 
material or the surface of the porous sheet is coated with 
a conductive material such as metal by chemical plating or 
vaporization. The conventional method of imparting conductivity 
to the base material has the following problems: It is necessary to perform vaporization in a 
vacuum device. It is uneasy to evaporate metal over the 
porous sheet in the vacuum device while it is being transported 
continuously along a transport path, because air 
leakage occurs at the entrance or the exit of the vacuum 
device. Thus, it is difficult to maintain vacuum state. 
Further, it is necessary to prepare a large equipment and 
manufacturing cost becomes high and further, it takes much 
time to impart conductivity to the porous sheet. A large number of processes is required to 
perform chemical plating method and a great
