<ABSTRACT>
A process and device are discloses for burning in a controllable and environmentally safe manner easily inflammable substances. Inknown processes, the substances are burned by a volume-taking reaction in a combustion chamber. This combustion reaction which is difficult to control and therefore often only incompletely carried out entails amont others the danger of an explosive deflagration of the reactive residual gasses. According to the invention, a body (2), preferably an elongated, axially symmetrical body (2), is at first produced from the substances and said body is introduced into a sluice chamber (1) closably linked to a container (12) under a negative pressure. At least the side surface(s) of the body (2) lie(s) snugly on the inner wall(s) of the sluice chamber (1), form a seal therewith or are positioned at a defined distance therefrom. The body (2) is ignited at its front face (5) on the side of the container (12), so that a combustion front which moves successively and continuously through the body is formed, and finally the combustion products formed in the combustion front are sucked off into the container (12) for subsequent disposal. This process and device are particularly advantageous for burning or disposing of solid propergols in an environmentally safe manner.
