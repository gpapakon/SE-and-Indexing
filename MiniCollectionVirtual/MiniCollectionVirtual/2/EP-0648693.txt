<ABSTRACT>
An overhead conveyor assembly of the type comprising 
a segmented chain consisting of a plurality of 

trolleys (10) having a longitudinal axis and moving 
along an overhead guide track (11); each trolley (10) 

comprises guide and cartering means (12, 13) near its 
opposite ends, alternately arranged along the length 

chain to run on horizontal and vertical walls (16, 
17, 18) of the guide track (11). Each trolley (10) 

is linked to a similar trolley (10) by an universal 
joint (19) at each of its opposite ends enabling each 

trolley (10) to articulate along two orthogonally 
arranged axes, and to independently rotate 

respectively along its longitudinal axis, while 
moving along said path. An overhead conveyor system 

is therefore provided which is extremely light, low 
noising and of considerable versatility of use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a conveying system 
for transporting loads and goods along a closed-loop 
path defined by an overthead guide track along which 
a plurality of load conveying trolleys move, which 
are appropriately connected one to the other by means 
of articulated joints to define a segmented chain 
along said path. Each trolley is provided with 
suitable guide and centering means arranged along 
orthogonally oriented axes in order to run on 
horizontal and vertical wall surfaces along the same 
slide track. The trolleys define a sort of endless 
chain which is continuously or intermittently drawn 
along the slide track, to allow the automatic removal 
and/or charging of loads to be transported. Overhead transport systems of the abovementioned type 
are widely known and commonly used in several areas 
of application. Examples of overhead conveyors of 
chain and trolley type are described in a number of 
prior documents, for example in GB-A-1011930, GB-A-1379916, 
FR-A-1171401, DE-A-1506887 and US-A-4793473. 
Generally in overhead transport systems, of the type  
 
previously mentioned, each trolley or element of the 
chain is connected to an adjacent one by means of a 
single or a double axes articulation joint which 
allow articulation solely along one or two axes at 
right angles to the slide direction of the trolleys 
themselves. The chain of trolleys is drawn by 
appropriate drive wheels which engage with the wheels 
of each trolley, or by providing the overhead 
conveyor with an additional drive chain comprising 
special parts for hooking trolleys. Generally, in overhead conveying systems which make 
use of articulated trolleys or chains, in addition to 
the problem of wear, there is also that of noise 
which is difficult to eliminate, and which is 
particularly serious in those work environments where 
the general level of noise should be maintained 
relatively low. An analysis of the phenomenon has led to the main 
causes of this noise being identified not only in the 
play or clearance between the hinges connecting the 
trolleys, but mainly in the vibrations caused by the 
trolleys rubbing against the guide tracks as a result 
of the trolley chain being unable to adapt correctly  
 
to the guide track, in particular along paths which 
are complex in shape, or according to specific 
requirements of use. The heaviness and complexity of 
traditional conveyors, or the inevitable pendular 
movements of the loads transported, in certain cases 
aggravate the problem of noise generated
