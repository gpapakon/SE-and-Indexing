<ABSTRACT>
A well perforating system includes a tubing string 
(16), a perforating gun (28), a differential pressure firing 

head (26) with an actuating piston exposed on one side to a 
high pressure zone, and on the other side to a low pressure 

zone, a firing head actuator (36), and a seat (24) to 
receive said actuator (36) whereupon the high and low 

pressure zones are isolated and the perforating gun can be 
actuated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a well 
perforating system. One operation commonly performed in the completion 
of an oil or gas well is the perforation of the steel casing 
of the well to communicate the well bore with a subsurface 
formation intersected by the well. Thus, formation fluids 
are allowed to be produced from the formation through the 
perforations and up through the well bore. Many techniques have been used in the past to 
actuate perforating guns to accomplish the formation of the 
perforations. For example, perforating guns have been 
actuated: (1) electrically; (2) through drop bar mechanisms; 
and (3) through pressure actuated mechanisms. One commonly used technique for conveying the 
perforating guns and associated apparatus into the well is 
to assemble them on a tubing string, thus providing what is 
commonly referred to as a tubing conveyed perforating 
system. Such tubing conveyed perforating systems are 
available from the Halliburton Reservoir Services division 
of Halliburton Company. One commonly used operating system for tubing 
conveyed perforating systems is a firing head which operates 
in response to a pressure differential. The pressure 
differential is created by applying increased pressure 
either to the tubing string or to the annulus surrounding  
 
the tubing string and conveying that increased pressure to an actuating piston 
contained in the firing head. Typically, such a firing head will have hydrostatic 
pressure balanced across the actuating piston as the tool is run into the well. When 
it is desired to operate the tool, increased pressure is applied to one side of the 
actuating piston. Thus, the low pressure reference for the actuating piston is 
hydrostatic pressure, and a pressure differential is created by increasing pressure on 
the high pressure side of the piston above hydrostatic pressure. One example of such 
a system is the Van Systems differential firing head shown at page TCP-1020 of Vann 
Systems Engineered Well Completion Product Catalog. Another approach of the prior art has utilised an isolated atmospheric 
chamber contained within a firing head as a low pressure reference zone. For 
example Vann Systems Pressure Actuated Firing Head shown at page TCP-1022 of 
Vann Systems Engineered Well Completion Product Catalog illustrates a firing 
head operating in response to increased tubing pressure which creates a pressure 
differential as compared to an atmospheric pressure chamber which is in constant 
communication with the low pressure side of
