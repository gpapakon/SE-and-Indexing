<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stabilised polymer
composition containing a polymer of carbon monoxide and one or more
olefins. In particular the invention relates to compositions
containing such polymer which exhibit good melt processing stability
in processes during which the composition is melted and subsequently
solidified.The preparation of random copolymers comprised of a minor
amount of carbon monoxide and a major amount of ethylene by catalysed
radical polymerisation has been known for some years. More recently
it has been found that linear alternating polymers of carbon monoxide
and one or more olefins, hereafter called polyketones, can be
prepared by contacting the reactants with a Group VIII metal catalyst
preferably comprised of palladium and a bidentate phosphine, see for
example EP 121965.Polyketones whilst being thermoplastics, suffer from the
disadvantage that they have relatively high melting points which are
close to the temperatures at which they undergo chemical degradation.
This causes a problem since the materials are thus difficult to
process using conventional melt processing technology.In order to overcome this problem a number of potential
approaches have been explored. EP213671 teaches that polyketones
comprised of carbon monoxide, ethylene and alpha olefin (e.g.
propylene) units have lower melting points than corresponding
copolymers of ethylene and carbon monoxide comprised only of carbon
monoxide and ethylene units and can thus be processed at lower 
temperatures where the rate of thermal degradation is slower. Whilst
this approach goes some way to alleviating the problem, there is
still a need to improve further the melt processing stability of
polyketones if they are to be processed on a commercial scale.Methods of further improving melt processability have centred
around a) the blending of polyketones with other polymers, b) the
addition of plasticisers and c) the use of additives claimed to
interfere with the degradation reactions which the polyketones
undergo. The first two types of approach suffer in that relatively
large amounts of the second polymer or plasticiser are required, a
consequence of which is that there is a general deterioration in the
physical, mechanical and barrier properties of the polyketone. An
example of the third type of approach is disclosed in EP 310166.
This patent teaches the addition of an aluminium alkoxide or a
derivative thereof. Examples of preferred additives are those having
the general formula Al(OR)3 where each R is independently
