<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transmitting member made of plastic intended for the rotational coupling of two moving parts designed to pivot about parallel rotation spindles. This member includes two levers (10, 20) designed to be coupled in rotation each to one moving part, connected by a connecting rod (40) formed integrally with the levers and coupled to the latter by hinge-forming bridges (50, 60) of material of minimal thickness, this thickness being chosen to allow an articulated connection between the connecting rod and the levers.

<CLAIMS>
Transmitting member (1) made of plastic intended 
for the rotational coupling of two moving parts which are 

capable of pivoting about parallel axes (2, 4) of 
rotation, comprising two levers each of which can be 

connected to one moving part, characterized in that this 
member is made of a plastic by injection moulding and in 

that the levers are connected by at least one hinge-forming 
bridge (50, 60; 150) of material, formed at the 

time the levers are formed and having a minimal thickness 
(e) chosen to give a hinged connection of the levers. 
Transmitting member according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that it includes two levers (10, 20) each of 

which can be coupled in terms of rotation with a moving 
part, these levers being connected by a link rod (40) 

formed at the time the levers are formed and attached to 
them by hinge-forming bridges (50, 60) of material, of 

minimal thickness (e) chosen to give a hinged connection 
between the link rod and the levers. 
Transmitting member according to either of Claims 
1 and 2, characterized in that the said minimal thickness 

(e) is between 0.2 and 1 mm. 
Transmitting member according to one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that each hinge-forming bridge of 

material is flattened in a direction parallel to the said 
axes of rotation and has outwardly concave main faces 

(60a) with a radius of curvature greater than or equal to 
0.2 mm. 
Transmitting member according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the link rod (40) has wedge-shaped end  

 
parts (51, 61) attached to the levers (10, 20) at their 

vertex by the said hinge-forming bridges (50, 60) of 
material. 
Transmitting member according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the wedge-shaped end parts are delimited 

by two flat faces (62, 63) oriented parallel to the said 
axes of rotation and forming between them a dihedron with 

a vertex angle (α) of close to 30°. 
Transmitting member according to either of Claims 
5 and 6, characterized in that the said wedge-shaped end 

parts are delimited by two flat faces (64, 65) oriented 
transversely to the said axes of rotation and diverging 

away from the link rod. 
Transmitting member according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that the said flat faces (64, 65) 

oriented transversely to the axes of rotation and diverging 
away from the link rod each form an angle (β) of 15° 

with a plane perpendicular to the said axes of rotation. 
Transmitting member according to one of Claims 1 
to 8, characterized in that each hinge-forming bridge of 

material is pivoted about the line attaching it to a 
lever shortly after demoulding. 
Device for distributing air inside a motor 
vehicle cabin, equipped with a transmitting member (1) 

according to one of Claims 1 to 9.
