<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to drinking vessels and more particularly to drinking vessels suitable for use as a trainer cup or the like.Trainer cups (that is a cup or mug provided with a lid having a mouthpiece - usually a spout - associated therewith) are well known and have been designed to bridge the gap between use of a baby's feeding bottle and use of a normal cup or glass by a young child. Such a trainer cup will often be a child's first step in learning to feed itself. As this period in a child's development will usually coincide with the cutting of its first teeth, quite apart from the child's inherent difficulty in handling what is new to it which may lead to the cup inadvertently being knocked over, the irritability characteristic of teething allied with the natural exuberance of young children bends to exacerbate what is frequently a noisy and messy experience.The existence of the lid may reduce or at least delay the effect of knocking the cup over, but will not deter a child from shaking the cup violently up and down. Neither will the lid delay spillage for very long if the cup is knocked over.US Patent 5,186,347 discloses a drinking container representative of a trainer cup in accordance with the preamble of claim 1.Belanger in US Patent 5 079 013 proposes an essentially dripless feeder cup. Liquid can only be obtained through the mouthpiece opening by sucking. The arrangement proposed by Belanger is complicated in construction including a number of separately assembled and separately movable parts including a ball valve 36 controlling the air inlet to the interior of the trainer cup and a liquid outlet control valve means which comprises a valve housing in which a valve body means is longitudinally slidable under the control of a separate coil spring 40 around its stem to open and dose a valve opening. The arrangement is such that upon sucking at the mouthpiece to create a predetermined difference in pressure between the exterior of the mouthpiece and the interior of the training feeding container, the valve body with its longitudinal valve stem will slide axially of the valve housing to open to allow liquid to leave the interior of the container. The number of separately formed and separately movable parts requiring several assembly steps meaning that the construction illustrated in US Patent 5 079 013 will be relatively expensive.In the somewhat different field of babies' feeding bottles, I have myself designed arrangements in which a valve interrupts the flow of fluid from the interior of

<CLAIMS>
A drinking vessel suitable for use as a trainer cup or the like, comprising: an open-mouthed generally cup-shaped container; (2, 2'); a lid (5, 5') for the open mouth of said cup-shaped container, the lid (5, 5') having a mouthpiece (6) associated therewith; and valve means (1, 1') associated with the lid and adapted to prevent flow of liquid from the interior of the container through the mouthpiece and to enable a user to draw liquid through the mouthpiece, the configuration of the valve means (1, 1') being such that said valve means is adapted to open upon no more than a predetermined difference of pressure, greater within the vessel than outside, being present across the said valve, whereby said valve means (1, 1') prevents flow from the interior unless a predetermined level of suction is applied to the mouthpiece, and a user is enabled to draw liquid through the mouthpiece (6) by the sole application of suction thereto to provide said difference of pressure; where said valve means (1, 1') comprises a self-closing slit valve (18) 
characterised in that
 said valve means (1, 1') is a separate valve member (10, 10') detachably fitted to the lid and located in use between the cup-shaped container (2, 2') and the lid (5, 5'), and said valve means comprises a dome-shaped region (14, 14') concave towards the interior of the cup-shaped container and underlying the mouthpiece (6), the dome-shaped region (14, 14') having a slit (18) therein defining the self-closing slit valve.
A drinking vessel according to claim 1, further 
characterised in that
 the lid (5, 5') is provided with an aperture (16, 16') to allow for the ingress of air.
A drinking vessel according to Claim 2, further 
characterised in that
 said vessel is provided with additional valve means (17) to prevent flow of liquid from the interior of the cup-shaped container through said aperture (16, 16').
A drinking vessel according to both Claim 3, further 
characterised in that
 both said valve means (18,17) are provided on the same said valve member (10, 10') located in use between the lid (5, 5') and the cup-shaped container (2, 2').
A drinking vessel according to Claim 4, further 
characterised in that
 said additional valve means (17) underlies said aperture (16, 16') and comprises a dome-shaped region (15, 15') convex towards the interior of the container and having a slit (17) to allow flow from the concave to the convex side but not in the opposite direction.
A drinking vessel according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in
 further comprising a support plate (20) to hold the valve member (1') in place beneath the lid.
