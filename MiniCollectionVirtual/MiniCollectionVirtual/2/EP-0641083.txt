<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a frequency synthesizer supplying a synthesised signal (NF), comprising an oscillator (10-2) supplying a high-speed clock signal (Fh) to a divider (22) which is programmable by a digital data item (C), the high-order bits (K) of the digital data item being supplied to the programmable divider and the low-order bits to an accumulator (26) interacting with the programmable divider to increment its order of division by one unit when the accumulator overflows. The synthesizer comprises: a generator 27 of n phases (NF1 to NFn) with increasing delays of the synthesised signal (NF); a circuit (29) for comparison of the content (A) of the accumulator with N ranges of possible increasing values; and a circuit (28) for selection, as synthesised signal, of the phase, the order of which corresponds to that of the range in which the content of the accumulator lies.

A frequency synthesizer providing a
synthesized signal (NF), including an oscillator (10-2)

that supplies a fast clock signal (Fh) to a divider (22)
programmable by a digital data (C), the most significant

bits (K) of the digital data being provided to the
programmable divider, and the least significant bits

being provided to an accumulator (26) that cooperates
with the programmable divider to increment by one unit

its division rank when the accumulator overflows,
characterized in that it includes:


a generator (27) for generating n phases (NF1-NFn)
of the synthesized signal (NF) having increasing

delays;
means (29) for comparing the content (A) of
the accumulator with n ranges of possible increasing

values; and
means (28) for selecting, as the synthesized
signal, the phase whos
e rank corresponds to the rank of
the range within which the content of the accumulator is

comprised.
The synthesizer of claim 1, characterized
in that it includes an oscillator (10-2) providing an odd

number n of clock phases having the same frequency and
delayed one with respect to the preceding by one n-th of

the clock period, the phases of the synthesized signal
being obtained from respective clock phases.
The synthesizer of claim 2, characterized
in that one the clock phases (Fh1) is provided to the

programmable divider so that the programmable divider
provides an initial phase (NF0) of the synthesized 

signal, the other phases of the synthesized signal being
obtained by synchronizing the initial phase of the

synthesized signal with the remaining clock phases,
respectively, one phase of the synthesized signal being

selected as the synthesized signal through a multiplexer
(28) controlled by said comparison means (29).
The synthesizer of claim 3, characterized
in that the phases (NF1, NF2, NF3) of the synthesized

signal are obtained through flip-flops (30, 32, 34)
connected in series after the programmable divider (22)

and enabled in interleaved mode by the clock phases (Fh1,
Fh2, Fh3).
The synthesizer of claim 4, characterized
in that said flip-flops are connected so that a flip-flop

of rank i (Di) is enabled by the clock phase of rank n+2-i
(modulo n), and provides the phase (NFn-i) of rank n-i

(modulo n) of the synthesized signal through a delay
circuit (Ti) of n-i-1 clock cycles.
