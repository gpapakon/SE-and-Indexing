<ABSTRACT>
A denitrification system comprises an electrostatic precipitator (3) 
in the foremost stage of the system inlet, an ozone supply 

nozzle (4) for an ozonizer (5) for generating ozone 
required for oxidizing the NO into NO₂, followed by a fan 

or an agitator (8), and an NO₂ absorbent filter (7) in the 
final stage arranged in that order. Further, this system 

may comprise the control of feeding back the residual O₃ 
concentration after oxidation, to achieve the higher 

denitrification rate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
denitrification system for processing exhaust gas of
normal-temperature and low-concentration in automobile
road tunnels or the like closed space.In recent years, installing a denitrification
system is required at a site near the exhaust tower of a
car road tunnel to cope with the environmental problem of
regulating the total amount or concentration of the
nitrogen oxides NOx emitted from the exhaust tower.A conventional denitrification system of such
type is generally configured as shown in Figs.11 and 15.
The configuration will be explained with reference to the
drawings.The NOx contained in the tunnel exhaust gas
drawn by a fan 103 includes NO and NO2 as main components,
of which NO is oxidized into NO2 by a high-voltage
discharge ionizer 101, as shown in FIG.11. The NO2
obtained by oxidation and the NO2 originally existing in
the NOx are absorbed by an NO2 absorbent filter 102
containing activated carbon and alkali,Also, as shown in FIG.15, the tunnel exhaust gas 
104 drawn by the fan 103 contains such components as SO2,
soot and dust in addition to the nitrogen oxides (NO and
NO2) as main components. As seen from the below-mentioned
chemical formula (1), all the NO is oxidized into NO2 by
an oxidizer, and NO2 is absorbed by an absorbent such
as KNO2, KNO3, Ca(NO2)2 and Ca(NO3)2 in an absorbent
filter 102, as seen fro: chemical formula 2.
NO + O3 → NO2 + O2 ,
NO + O* → NO2 .2NO2 + 2KOH → KNO2 + KNO3 + H2O ,
4NO2 + 2Ca(OH)2 → Ca(NO2)2 + Ca(NO3)2 + H2O .The important points in the aforementioned
processes for oxidation control to maximize the
denitrification rate off the denitrification system are as
follows:
(1) To oxidize NO into NO2 while mixing the
oxidizing materials (O3, O*) commensurate with the ever-changing
total amount (in mol) of the NO at the inlet.(2) The oxidizing materials (O3, O*) are consumed by
SO2, dust and humidity as well as by the NO at the inlet
of the denitrification system.A configuration for oxidation control is shown
in the block diagram of FIG.16. The total No amount 118
at the inlet is calculated from the NO concentration value
116 at the inlet obtained from an NO concentration meter
113 installed as a detection part at or near the inlet of 
the denitrification system, and from gas flow rate 117
calculated by an anemometer 114. In a similar fashion, a
total inlet SO2 amount 124, a total inlet dust amount 126
and a total inlet humidity 128 are calculated from the
output of an inlet SO2 concentration meter 120, an inlet
dust concentration
