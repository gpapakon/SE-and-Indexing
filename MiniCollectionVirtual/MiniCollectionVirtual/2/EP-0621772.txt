<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a hair fixer which contains 1 to 12 wt. % in alcoholic or aqueous-alcoholic solution of a polymer combination consisting of a) at least one vinyl pyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer and b) at least one 60 to 100 %-neutralised vinyl acetate-vinyl propionate-crotonic acid terpolymer, in which copolymer a) and terpolymer b) are in the weight ratio of 1:9 to 9:1. With halogen-free hydrocarbons as propellants, this agent is highly environmentally compatible, has excellent fixing properties and can easily be washed out of the hair.

<CLAIMS>
Hair-setting agent based on an alcoholic 
or aqueous-alcoholic solution containing from 1 to 

12 weight % of a polymer combination, 
characterised in that the polymer combination 

consists of a) at least one vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl 
acetate copolymer and b) at least one vinyl 

acetate-vinylproprionate-crotonic acid terpolymer 
neutralized to 60 to 100%, the copolymer a) and 

the terpolymer b) being present in a weight ratio 
of from 1:9 to 9:1. 
Agent according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that it contains the copolymer a) in an amount 

of from 0.5 to 10 weight %. 
Agent according to either of Claims 1 and 
2, characterised in that it contains the 

terpolymer b) in an amount of from 0.5 to 10 
weight %. 
Agent according to any one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that the weight ratio of 

copolymer a) to terpolymer b) is from 2:8 to 8:2.

1
-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methyl-1,2-propane 
diamine. 
Agent according to any one of Claims 1 to 
5, characterised in that it contains from 15 to 85 

weight % of a propellant and is in the form of an 
aerosol hair spray or aerosol hair lacquer. 
Agent according to any one of Claims 1 to
