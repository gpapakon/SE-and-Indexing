<ABSTRACT>
Signal generating apparatus comprises a linear series of Hall-effect switches (44) arranged as a plurality of linear arrays in discrete probes (46a, 46b...46n) which are butted end to end. Each switch is closed when in proximity of an actuating magnet (40) movable along the series of switches. In each array a resistance chain (66) is linked at intervals to the switches. Movement of the magnet along an array thereby gives a progressively changing voltage on an output line (50) from the resistance chain as a cumulative signal indicating the position of the magnet. When the magnet moves from one array to the succeeding array after generating a maximum cumulative signal from said one array, that signal is maintained by a latch connection (56) between the two arrays. A cumulative signal representing the magnet position relative to the complete series of switches can thus be generated. The arrays are powered in parallel so that it is possible to extend substantially the total number of switches or indicating points in the apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to signal generating 
apparatus, and in particular to position-responsive 
apparatus, for example for monitoring a liquid level, and 
to a method of deriving position-responsive signals, eg. in 
order to sense and display particular values and/or to 
control a variable determining those values. There are many processes in which a directly 
contacting probe or the like cannot be employed to monitor 
changes of position, for example because of a hostile 
environment or the aggressive nature of the material being 
monitored. Non-contacting sensors must then be used, such 
as devices responsive to magnetic fields. Non-contacting liquid level indicators have been 
described employing a vertical array of magnetic switches, 
as in the examples of GB 997861 and US 4627283 and 4589282, 
in which a magnet carried by a float operates the switches 
without contacting them. Such switches have an on-off 
operation so that they provide stepped measurements, but 
that is not necessarily a disadvantage if the steps are 
sufficiently small. In the last-mentioned US 4589282 in 
particular, there is proposed the use of Hall-effect 
switches, which provide relatively compact and convenient 
switching devices with a small power consumption. These earlier proposals are limited in respect of  
 
range and/or accuracy of measurement, however. It will be 
understood, that the incremented signal change between 
successive steps must be sufficient to be unaffected by 
circuit noise so that it soon becomes inconvenient to cope 
with the increasing signal voltage range if it is required 
to have an indicator with a very large number of steps, 
whether for increased accuracy or for greater range of 
measurement. In the apparatus of US 4589282 a vernier-like 
arrangement of switches and magnets is proposed to 
increase the accuracy of measurement but that requires 
complex circuitry which itself poses a practical limit to 
the maximum number of steps or graduations over the range 
of measurement. In DE3510198 a liquid level indicator is described 
which comprises a series of magnetic switches operated by 
a magnet carried by a float. The magnetic switches are 
connected to a series of resistance elements. In DE4011858 a liquid level indicator is described 
which comprises a series of magnetic switches operated by 
a magnet carried by a float. The magnetic switches are 
arranged in successive arrays. According to one aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided a position responsive apparatus 
including:

successive arrays (46a, 46b, 46n) thereof, each sensor 

(44) having a sensor output line, 
(b) a series of resistance elements (66) connected tc the 
proximity sensors (44), 
(c) sensor actuating means (40) traversable along the 
series of sensors (44) without contact therewith, 
 
characterised in that 


(d) for each array of sensors (46a,46b,46n), there is 

(i) an array of resistance elements (66), the sensor 
output lines being connected to the array of 

resistance elements (66 at positions in said 
resistance array dependent upon the positions of the 

sensors (46) in their array (46a,46b,46n), 
(ii) an array output line (50a,50b,50n) at an end of 
the array of resistance elements (66) and

(e) the sensor actuating means (40) is traversable along 
the series of sensors (44) whereby in operation when the 

sensor actuating means (40) is in proximity to a sensor 
(44), the sensor (44) puts a sensor signal on the sensor  

 
output line, which sensor signal after passing through the 

array of resistance elements (66) becomes an array signal 
on the array output line (50a,50b,50n), traversing of the 

sensor actuating means (40) along the array (46a,46b,46n), 
thereby changing the magnitude of the array signal in 

accordance with the position of the sensor actuating means 
(40), and 
(f) array signal latching means (56) for passing array 

signals between successive array of sensors (46a,46b,46n) 
such that when the sensor actuating means (40) traverses 

from any one of the arrays (46a, 46b,46n) to a succeeding 
array (46a,46b,46n) after generating a maximum signal from 

said one array (46a,46b,46n), the array signal latching 
means (56) passes the maximum signal to the signal 

processor (52a,52b,52n) of the succeeding array 
(46a,46b,46n), the signal processor (52a,52b,52n) having 

means for summing the maximum signal with the array signal 
from the succeeding array (46a,46b,46n), thereby to 

generate a cumulative signal representing the sensor 
actuating means (40) position relative to the complete 

series of sensors (44).

inputs are to be applied in dependence upon the number of 
said inputs.
