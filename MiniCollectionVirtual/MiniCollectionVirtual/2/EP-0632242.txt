<ABSTRACT>
In order to dry and/or heat bulk material in a drying drum (1a/b), in particular in asphalt plants, the temperature of the waste gases of a burner (5a/b) which heats the drying drum (1a/b) is measured. In addition to this measured value, there is determined a measured value in connection with the material to be supplied to the drying and/or heating process and/or already undergoing the latter, and the inflow of the combustible medium and oxygen carrier for the burner (5a/b) is controlled as a function of the measured values. By this procedure, the heating and/or drying process for the material to be used is controlled in such a way that the process proceeds in a manner which is optimal in terms of fuel engineering, with low pollutant content in the waste gases. The apparatus for carrying out the process has a burner (5a/b) arranged in a drying drum (1a/b) rotatable about the longitudinal axis (2), a temperature-measuring device (22a/b) and a filter arrangement (17) for the burner waste gases, an adjusting device (31a/b, 32a/b) for adjusting the inflow of combustion medium and oxygen carrier, a measuring device (22a/b; 24a/b; 25a-f; 27a-f) for measuring at least one physical value of the material to be supplied to the drying and/or heating process and/or already undergoing the latter.
