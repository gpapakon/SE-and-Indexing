<CLAIMS>
High-pressure discharge lamp with a ceramic
discharge vessel (4) - particularly, located in an outer

bulb (1) - which contains a discharge volume and an
ionizable filling, in particular with metal halides, the

discharge vessel (4) having two ends (6) with openings,
and two electrodes (11), comprising a shank (12) and head

(13; 20), being connected to externally located supply
leads (7) via pin-shaped bushings (9), and the bushing

being fastened in an end opening in a vacuum-tight fashion
in each case, the ends of the discharge vessel being

sealed by stoppers (10), and the bushings being inserted
in openings of the stoppers, a portion of the electrode

shank being surrounded inside the discharge volume by a
sleeve (17; 29) made from a high-melting material,

characterized in that the bushings (9) consist of
tungsten or molybdenum, and in that the sleeve (17, 29)

is inserted into a depression on the discharge-side end
face (30) of the stopper, a predominant portion of the

electrode shank (12), starting from the stopper, being
covered by the sleeve, the sleeve (29) being spaced from

the head of the electrode.
High-pressure discharge lamp according to Claim
1, characterized in that the inside diameter of the

sleeve is more than 200 Âµm larger than the diameter of
the electrode shank.
High-pressure discharge lamp according to Claim
1, characterized in that the bushing is sintered directly

into the stopper.
High-pressure discharge lamp according to Claim 
1, characterized in that the sleeve (17; 29) is produced

from ceramic, quartz glass or high-melting metal.
High-pressure discharge lamp according to Claim
1, characterized in that the sleeve also surrounds a

portion of the bushing.
High-pressure discharge lamp according to Claim
1, characterized in that the inside diameter of the

sleeve is matched to the diameter of the electrode shank.
High-pressure discharge lamp according to Claim
4, characterized in that the sleeve is formed by a

compact filament (40) made from high-melting metal.
