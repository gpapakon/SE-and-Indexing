<ABSTRACT>
An operating turbine monitor is described 
incorporating one or more acoustic sensors (76,77) positioned 

next to a blade row (25) of a rotor, an analog digital 
converter (90), a tachometer sensor (70) at the rotor shaft (20), a 

memory (92), a synchronous averaging circuit (100), a subtractor 
circuit (108), and a comparator (114). The invention overcomes the 

problem of monitoring an operating turbine for 
order-related turbine blade vibration and for non 

order-related turbine blade vibration as well as for 
other turbine conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to monitoring the vibration 
of turbine blades in an operating turbine and more 
particular to detecting and locating non order-related 
vibrating turbine blades. In U.S.A. Patent 4,422,333 by R.L. Leon, the 
inventor herein, and which issued on December 27, 1983, 
a method and apparatus was described for detecting and 
identifying one or more excessively vibrating blades of 
the rotating portion of a turbomachine. An acoustic 
sensor was positioned to receive a characteristic 
Doppler waveform that resulted when a blade or blade 
group vibrates resonately at an order of running speed. 
The method described in the '333 patent for constant 
speed turbines, involved synchronous averaging out the 
non order- related background noise followed by editing 
or blanking out the few order related components known 
to be contaminated with background error such as blade 
passing frequency and once-per-revolution and 
twice-per-revolution frequencies. The resulting signal 
is then displayed to reveal the characteristic Doppler 
waveform of the blade vibrations. An envelope 
detection technique was employed to accurately pick out 
the amplitude peak indicative of the location of the 
resonant blade. It was discovered that in some steam 
power turbines that the order related background error 
was not limited to just a few order-related components, 
but instead was spread broadly across all the order 
related components. Blanking all of the offending 
order-related background components would, of course, 
eliminate entirely the sought after Doppler waveform.  
 In accordance with the present invention, a method 
and apparatus is provided for detecting a non order-related 
vibrating blade attached to the shaft of a rotating 
rotor in an operating turbine as defined in claims 1 and 2.  
 It is an object of the invention to detect 
non order-related or fluttering turbine blades by 
processing the data obtained from many revolutions with 
the data obtained from a few revolutions.  
 Fig. 1 is a pictorial and schematic diagram of a 
two flow tandem compound turbine. Fig. 2 is a cross section view along the lines 2-2 
of Fig. 1. Figs. 3 and 4 show one turbine blade of a blade 
row 
vibrating at a first and at a fourth resonant frequency 
respectively. Figs. 5 and 6 show one turbine blade of a blade 
row vibrating at first and fourth resonant frequencies 
shifted in phase respectively. Fig. 7 is one embodiment of the invention.
