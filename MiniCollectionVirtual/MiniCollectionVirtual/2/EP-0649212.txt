<ABSTRACT>
A motor stator assembly is incorporated in a full-circumferential 
flow pump which has an annular space around a 

motor. The motor stator assembly comprises a stator, an outer 
frame casing encasing the stator, an outer cylinder made of 

sheet metal disposed around the outer frame casing with an 
annular space defined therebetween, and a cable housing 

hermetically welded to the outer frame casing and the outer 
cylinder, for housing leads of the stator. The outer cylinder 

can be elongated axially so as to cover the end portions of the 
motor frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motor stator
assembly and a full-circumferential flow pump employing such a
motor stator assembly, and more particularly to a motor stator
assembly including an outer frame casing provided around a
motor stator and an outer cylinder disposed around the outer
frame casing with an annular space defined therebetween, and a
full-circumferential flow pump employing such a motor stator
assembly.There have been known full-circumferential flow pumps
which have an annular fluid passage between a pump casing and
a motor accommodated in the pump casing. In general, the full-circumferential
flow pump has a pump casing comprising a
suction-side casing, a discharge-side casing, and an outer
cylinder extending between the suction-side casing and the
discharge-side casing. The suction-side casing and the
discharge-side casing are generally highly rigid as they are
each made of a casting such as an iron casting.The full-circumferential flow pump also includes a
motor fixedly supported in the rigid suction- and discharge-side
casings.The motor can fixedly be supported in the suction-and
discharge-side casings because they are in the form of
rigid castings. If these casings comprise sheets pressed to
shape, the motor cannot fixedly be supported in the casings 
because they are not sufficiently rigid.
Attention is drawn to DE-A-4 252 394 and EP-A-0 566 086.DE-A-3 239 601 discloses a motor stator assembly for a full-circumferential flow pump, said motor comprising: a stator, an outer frame casing (5) encasing said stator; and an outer cylinder (13) disposed around said outer frame casing with an annular space defined therebetween.In accordance with the present invention a motor stator assembly
as set forth in claim 1 is provided. Preferred embodiments
of the invention are disclosed in the dependent claims.It is therefore an object of the present invention is
to provide a full-circumferential flow pump which has a motor
securely supported in a pump casing made of sheet metal.Another object of the present invention is to provide
a motor stator assembly which provides excellent productivity
and can be applied to many types of pumps.According to one aspect of the present invention,
there is provided a motor stator assembly comprising: a stator;
an outer frame casing encasing the stator; an outer cylinder
made of sheet metal disposed around the outer frame casing with
an annular space defined therebetween; and a cable housing
for housing leads of the stator, the housing being hermetically
welded
