<ABSTRACT>
An image display device includes an image 
display unit (4) including a plurality of pixels (10) patterned in a dot matrix in two 

dimensions and having a path (2) of travel of imagewise rays of light, and the two-dimensional 
diffraction grating (5) disposed on the path (2) of travel of the imagewise 

rays of light leading from the image display unit (4). An imaging device also 
includes the two-dimensional diffraction grating disposed between a      photo-taking 

lens and a solid-state imaging element. 
The image display device according to the present invention makes use 
of a two-dimensional diffraction grating (5) of a type which includes a 

plurality of grating elements arranged in two directions different from 
each other and in which the grating elements in one on the directions 

have a substantially uniform grating height when viewed in an 
arbitrarily chosen section along such one of the directions and, also 

the grating elements in the other of the directions have a substantially 
uniform grating height when viewed in an arbitrarily chosen section 

along the other of the directions. 
With this structure, since the two-dimensional diffraction grating 
disposed on an optical path (2) of an image display unit has respective 

patterns of grating elements arranged in the two directions extending at 
an angle relative to each other, rays of light incident upon the 

two-dimensional diffraction grating are diffracted in two dimension. As a 
result thereof, the diffracted light is diffused into the shades of 

non-transparent portions of the pixels in the image display to improve 

the quality of the image being viewed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video device such as, for example, 
a liquid crystal display device or an imaging device of a type utilizing a two-dimensional 
diffraction grating. This type of liquid crystal display device is, for example, used as a 
viewfinder and generally comprises a liquid crystal cell adapted to be illuminated 
from rear by rays of light from a light source to provide a reproduction of an image 
which is viewed by a viewer looking through the viewfinder from a side remote 
from the light source. Since the rays of light from the light source which have 
passed through the liquid crystal cell and carried the image to be viewed is viewed, 
it often occurs that the quality of the image being viewed is lowered under the 
influence of shades of pixel electrodes and conductor lines contained in the liquid 
crystal cell. Particularly where the liquid crystal cell is adapted to be driven by an 
active matrix drive system and, therefore, incorporates a number of non-linear 
elements such as thin-film transistors for the pixels to increase the capacity of 
information to be displayed so that televised pictures can be displayed, the non-linear 
elements and pixel electrodes both used to drive the liquid crystal cell on the 
active matrix drive system are generally made of opaque material and, therefore, 
the active matrix liquid crystal cell is susceptible to a reproduction of relatively 
dark shades of the non-linear elements and the pixel electrodes. These shades of the non-linear elements and pixel electrodes are, 
when projected by a lens on a screen or when a virtual image projected through a 
lens is viewed, considerably noticeable to such an extent as to result in a lowering  
 
of the quality of the image being viewed. In order to minimize the lowering of the 
quality of the image under the influence of shades of the non-linear element and 
electrodes, it has been suggested to employ a diffraction grating positioned in front 
of the liquid crystal cell, that is, at a location adjacent the eye of a viewer and 
remote from the light source. While the use of the diffraction grating is effective to avoid the 
lowering of the quality of images being viewed under the influence of shades of the 
non-linear elements and pixel electrodes, it has been found that the use of the 
diffraction grating in turn brings about a reduction in contrast of the image to such 
an extent that the image being viewed is blurred. On the other hand, in an imaging device of a type utilizing a solid-state 
imagin
