<ABSTRACT>
A syringe assembly includes a syringe body (5), and 
a plunger (4) having a main body (45) and a gasket (40) 

mounted on its distal end portion. A needle-mounting 
member (3) is detachably mounted on a distal end portion 

of the plunger main body (45). A plunger-engaging 
mechanism (32) is provided on the needle-mounting 

member (3). An engaging member (42) is provided on a 
distal end of the gasket (40), for engaging with the 

plunger-engaging mechanism (32). The needle-mounting 
member (3) and the plunger (4) further have a first 

structure (33,41) which transmits a torque from the 
plunger (4) in a direction to release an engagement 

between the syringe main body (5) and the needle-mounting 
member (3) to the needle-mounting member (3), 

and a second structure (33,41) which releases an 
engagement between the engaging member (42) and the 

plunger-engaging mechanism (32) through a rotation of 
the plunger (4) in a direction to keep an engagement 

between the needle-mounting member (3) and the plunger 
main body (45).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a syringe assembly
to be used for delivering a therapeutic liquid into a
subject or for drawing blood from a subject, and more
particularly to a syringe assembly which is capable of
withdrawing the hypodermic needle into the syringe
barrel after use.A hypodermic syringe is conventionally employed for
delivering a therapeutic liquid into a subject or for
drawing blood from a subject.The hypodermic syringe generally comprises a
plunger provided at its distal end with a gasket, and a
cylindrical barrel provided at its distal end with a
needle engaging means.Recently, it is increasingly desired to assuredly
protect therapeutic technicians from being infected with
AIDS, hepatitis, and other infections. However, as a
matter of fact, a syringe user sometimes have other
works to do such as an operation to stop bleeding upon the
withdrawal of a syringe, so that it is often difficult
for the syringe user to pay a full attention to the
syringe that has been withdrawn from a subject. In such
a case, the syringe having it needle tip contaminated
with blood of a patient is left for a while in order to
do other pressing jobs such as bleed stopping operation,
and after finishing these pressing jobs the syringe user
can do the capping of the needle and discard the syringe 
along with the capped needle.However, when the syringe is left on a table after
the withdrawal of the needle, or when the syringe falls
on the floor, it may become a cause of infection from
blood, or create a risk of accidental pricking of fingers
due to the exposed needle.Recently, there has been proposed a syringe provided
with a needle-protecting mechanism, as shown in, for
example WO-A-92/05821 or U.S. Patent 4,978,340. The
syringe proposed in this U.S. Patent comprises a syringe
body, a plunger adapted to be retracted into the syringe
body, and a needle carrier for engaging a needle, which
is detachably mounted through thread-engagement on the
distal end of the syringe body. When the plunger is
rotated in the direction to release the engagement
between the syringe body and the needle carrier, the
rotation is transmitted to the needle carrier thereby
allowing the needle carrier to be detached together with
the needle from the syringe body. Accordingly, it is
possible to retract the needle together with the plunger
into the syringe body by sliding the plunger rearward.Since the needle after use can be easily retracted
into the syringe body in this manner, the safety of the
syringe is assured.In the above syringe,

<CLAIMS>
A syringe assembly which comprises:

a syringe body (5) having an open distal end
and an open proximal end, and defining therein a

passage;
a plunger (4) comprising a main body (45)
having a distal end and a proximal end, and a gasket

(40) mounted on a distal end portion of said main body
and adapted to be slidably and liquid-tightly housed in

said syringe body (5);
a needle-mounting member (3) detachably screwed
into a distal end portion of said syringe body (5);
plunger-engaging means (32) provided on said
needle-mounting member;
needle-mounting member-engaging means (42)
formed on a distal end portion of said gasket (40), and

adapted to be engaged with said plunger-engaging means

(32); and
torque-transmitting means (33, 41) provided on
said needle-mounting member (3) and said plunger (4)

for transmitting a torque from said plunger (4) to
said needle-mounting member (3) in a first direction to release an

engagement between said syringe body (5) and said
needle-mounting member (3);
said syringe assembly being 
characterized by

further comprising engagement-releasing means (33a,
41a), provided on said needle-mounting member (3)

and/or said plunger (4), for releasing an engagement
between said needle-mounting member-engaging means (42)

and said plunger-engaging means (32) through a rotation
of said plunger (4) in a second, opposite direction to keep an

engagement between said needle-mounting member (3) and
said syringe body (5).
The syringe assembly according to claim 1,

comprises a plurality of first ribs (41) formed on a

columnar body (42) mounted on a distal end surface of
