<ABSTRACT>
A valve, such as a compressor or line service valve, for use in 
refrigeration or air conditioning fluid circuits having an Improved flow for improved 

energy efficiency is disclosed. The valve incorporates a rotary ball member (24) with a 90° 
fluid passage diameter that is equal to or greater than the diameter of the fluid line 

that it services. Rotation of a primary actuator stem (44) rotates the ball member to open 
and close the valve. An annular ball seal (34) provides a seat against which the ball may 

be positively sealed. A secondary stem (72) is aligned on an alternate axis (1) from the 
primary stem that is preferably collinear with a fluid line. The secondary stem 

effectuates a positive engagement between the rotary ball member and the ball seal. 
A plunger (36) cooperates with locator indentations (28) and a groove in the rotary ball member 

to center the ball within the valve and align its fluid passage with fluid line connectors. 
Locator indentations also ensure that the rotary ball member is properly oriented when 

in either the opened or closed positions. When the secondary stem is engaged, it 
effectuates a positive shut-off force to seal the ball member against the ball seal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to valves for use in the fluid
circuits of refrigeration and air-conditioning systems and, more particularly, to
compressor valves and line service valves.Compressor valves and line service valves have been commonly used
in refrigeration system fluid circuits to direct the flow of refrigerant through the circuit
or retain the charge of liquid or gaseous refrigerant while isolating a portion of the
circuit to facilitate the repair and/or replacement of system components or to perform
general system maintenance. Examples of such valves are illustrated in prior art
Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows a typical valve, such as one that is commonly made
out of brass or steel which is used on compressors in the refrigeration and air-conditioning
industry. The valve 100 includes a primary stem operator 102 that is
disposed for linear movement within a valve body 104 by a threaded engagement,
indicated at 106. Packing, generally indicated at 108, seals the valve 100 at the
primary stem operator 102 while still allowing it to be rotatable in the valve body 104.
At one end of the stem operator 102 is a globe-type plug or closure element 110 that
is operable to completely block off a fluid passage 112. The primary stem operator
102 is linearly positionable between an opened position (as shown in Figure 1) and
a closed position (not shown) when rotated. In the opened position, the closure
element 110 is backseated against the valve body 104 at location 114 and fluid is
capable of flowing through the valve 100. In the closed position, the closure element 
110 is advanced into fluid passage 112 and seated against valve body 104 at location
116. In this position, fluid flow through the valve 100 is prevented.Figure 2 depicts a cast iron compressor valve which is generally used
with fluid line diameters greater than or equal to 54 mm (2 1/8"). Very similar to the other
compressor valve described above, the cast iron valve 120 includes a primary stem
operator 122 that is disposed for linear displacement within a valve body 124 by a
threaded engagement 126. Located at one end of the primary stem operator 122 is
a globe-type closure element 128 which is operable to block off a fluid passage 130
through the valve. In the opened position, the closure element 128 is backseated
against the valve body 124 at location 132 and fluid is capable of flowing through the
valve 120. In the closed position, the closure element 128 is advanced into fluid
passage 130 and seated against valve body 124 at
