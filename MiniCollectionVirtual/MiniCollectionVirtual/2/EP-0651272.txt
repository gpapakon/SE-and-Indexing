<ABSTRACT>
Zoom lenses are described for endoscope-like devices, which are to be fitted to the proximal end of the device. Operating the zoom lens is very simple: at first, the image is focused by means of the focusing element, and then the entire enlargement range can be used without refocusing. The simplicity of operation permits devices equipped with zoom lenses of this type to be widely used, in particular in the field of medicine. As a result of the very simple image adjustment, the user is hardly distracted any longer from his medical activity.
