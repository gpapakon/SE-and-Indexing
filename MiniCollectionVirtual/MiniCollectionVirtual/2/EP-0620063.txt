<ABSTRACT>
In an installation for producing a steel strip by deforming a continuously cast steel slab (5), consisting of a continuous-casting machine with an oscillating continuous-casting mould (1) having cool walls and with a deformation device (2) for the steel slab arranged at the mould outlet and having deformation rollers, surface defects in the steel slab due to a slag-removal and descaling device associated with the deformation rollers (3, 4) can be avoided if spray nozzles (7) on the side facing away from the slab (5) are directed at the deformation rollers (3, 4).

<CLAIMS>
Plant for the production of a steel strip by deforming a continuously cast steel
strand, consisting of a continuous casting machine with an oscillating continuous flow chill

mould with cooled walls and a deforming device, which is arranged at the chill mould outlet
and comprises deforming rolls, for the steel strand, characterised thereby that spray

nozzles (7) are during casting directed onto the deforming rolls (3, 4) at the side remote
from the strand (5).
Plant according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the spray nozzles (7) are
arranged in a box-like housing (6).
Plant according to claim 2, characterised thereby that the housing (6) is resiliently
placed against the deforming rollers (3,4).
Plant according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the spray nozzles (7) are
associated with components conveying away water as well as scale and slag.
Plant according to claim 4, characterised thereby that the components are
constructed as downflow guide plates (9).
