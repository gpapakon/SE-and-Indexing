<ABSTRACT>
Plant growth stimulants containing compounds which increase intracellular carbon dioxide as the main active component and optionally supplemented with specific nutrients have been found to enhance productivity of plants. Exemplary compounds include lower alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, and butanol, and amino acids, such as glycine, glutamate, and aspartate. Such growth stimulation appears to result, in part, from inhibition of stress-induced photorespiration according to a previously unrecognized photosynthetic pathway. Exposure of the plants to sunlight or other sufficient illumination following treatment with the compositions results in enhanced fixation of carbon dioxide and turgor. Stimulant compositions may comprise from 5 % to 50 % by volume aqueous solutions of methanol or 0.1 % to 10 % by weight amino acids and are preferably applied by foliar spraying of plants and plant shoots.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
methods and compositions for stimulating and maintaining
enhanced growth in plants. More particularly, the
present invention relates to plant growth formulations
which contain methanol, methanol metabolites and/or amino
acids, which compositions are able to increase turgor
pressure and enhance carbon fixation in plants.Photosynthesis is the process by which
photosynthetic plants utilize solar energy to build
carbohydrates and other organic molecules from carbon
dioxide and water. The conversion of carbon dioxide to
such organic molecules is generally referred to as carbon
fixation and, in most plants, occurs by the reductive
pentose phosphate cycle, usually referred to as the C3
cycle. The C3 cycle involves the carboxylation of
ribulose diphosphate (RuDP) with carbon dioxide to
produce hexoses and other organic molecules.Fertilizers for higher plants generally include
nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are referred
to as primary nutrients or macronutrients. Fertilizers
often further include certain secondary nutrients, such
as iron, sulfur, calcium, and magnesium, as well as
various minerals and micronutrients. Heretofore, little
attention has been paid to providing fertilizers which
act directly to enhance carbon fixation in higher plants.
Conventional fertilizer formulations have generally been
directed at the delivery of the recognized primary,
secondary, and micronutrients, but have usually not
included a carbon source and in particular have not
included a carbon source intended to enhance carbon
fixation by the C3 cycle or otherwise. For these reasons, it would be desirable to
provide improved methods and formulations for promoting
plant growth by enhancing the rate of carbon fixation
within the plant. It would be particularly desirable if
such methods and compositions were effective with most or
all higher plants, more particularly including those
plants which fix carbon via the C3 pathway. The present
invention should further provide convenient methods for
applying the compositions, such as applying the
compositions as a foliar spray, and should preferably
result in increased plant turgidity. Additionally, it
would be desirable if the methods and compositions of the
present invention could promote rapid growth and maturing
of the treated plant, increase sugar content in the
plant, reduce the watering requirement of the plant, and
enhance environmental tolerance of the plant.Study of the path of carbon in photosynthesis
