<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for drying strip material (1), in particular paper strips, comprising, on a frame (2), two series (S1, S2) of drying nozzles (3), which delimit in a plane (P) a corridor for the passage of the strip material on a trajectory (T) and each of which series of drying nozzles is situated in a plane (P1, P2) essentially parallel to the plane (P), the drying nozzles being perpendicular to the trajectory of the material, each nozzle comprising at least one narrow longitudinal slot (4) which is capable of allowing a drying gas (5), for example air, to flow out, said longitudinal slot being delimited by the space comprised between two essentially parallel, internal (12) and external (11), longitudinal metal sheets which are fixed to the nozzle by known means, means of obstruction being provided for selectively neutralising a large number of zones (6) of at least one slot, characterised in that said neutralised zones are formed by a local stamping of the external metal sheet laid flat against the internal metal sheet, the space situated between two neutralised zones constituting a window (13) via which the drying gas flows out.

<CLAIMS>
Device for drying a material in strip form (1),
particularly paper in strip form, including, on a frame (2),

two series (S
1
, S
2
) of drying nozzles (3) delimiting, in one
plane (P), a corridor for the passage of the material in

strip form over a path (T), each of the series of drying
nozzles being located in a plane (P
1
, P
2
) substantially
parallel to the plane (P), the drying nozzles being

perpendicular to the path of the material, each nozzle
comprising at least one narrow longitudinal slit (4) suitable

for allowing a drying gas (5), for example air, to flow
therethrough, said longitudinal slit being delimited by the

space contained between two substantially parallel
longitudinal metal plates, an inner one (12) and an outer one

(11), fixed to the nozzle by known means, blocking means
being provided to selectively neutralize a plurality of areas

(6) of at least one slit, characterized in that the said
neutralized areas (6) are formed by local stamping to press

the outer plate (11) against the inner plate, the space
between two neutralized areas forming a window (13) through

which the drying gas flows.
Device for drying a material in strip form according
to claim 1, characterized in that the neutralized areas (6)

are regularly distributed along the narrow longitudinal
slits (4).
Device for drying a material in strip form according
to claim 1 or 2, wherein each nozzle includes two narrow

longitudinal slits (4), characterized in that the neutralized
areas (6) of the two slits are offset.
Device for drying a material in strip form according
to claim 3, characterized in that the neutralized areas (6)

of the two slits are staggered.
Device for drying a material in strip form according
to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the

successive neutralized areas (6) of the slits (4) in the 
nozzles of one or the other, or of both, of the series of

nozzles are offset by a given pitch (π).
Device for drying a material in strip form according
to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the

ratio of the constant width (L
n
) of the neutralized areas (6)
of a slit (4) to the constant width (L
f
) of the windows (13)
of this slit assumes a value of 0.3 to 0.7.
Device for drying a material in strip form according
to claims 5 and 6, characterized in that the offsetting pitch

(π) of the successive neutralized areas (6) of the slits (4)
in the nozzles is equal to (L
n
+L
f
)/n, where n has a value of
2 to 5.
