<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to semiconductor
devices, and more particularly to semiconductor power
devices and methods for fabricating such devices.Power devices are widely used to carry large
currents at high voltages. Since the early 1950's,
developers of electronic power systems began to base
their high power systems on semiconductor devices.The power bipolar transistor was first
developed in the early 1950's, and its technology has
matured to a high degree, allowing the fabrication of
devices with current handling capability of several
hundred amperes and blocking voltages of 600 volts.
However, despite the attractive power ratings achieved
for bipolar transistors, there are several fundamental
drawbacks in their operating characteristics. First,
the bipolar transistor is a current-controlled device.
A large base-drive current, typically one fifth to one
tenth of the collector current, is required to maintain
the power bipolar transistor in the on state. Even
larger reverse base drive currents are necessary to
obtain high speed turn-off. These characteristics make
the base drive circuitry complex and expensive. Bipolar transistors are also vulnerable to a
second breakdown failure mode under the simultaneous
application of a high current and high voltage to the
device, as would commonly be required in inductive
power circuits. It is also difficult to parallel
bipolar power devices because the forward voltage drop
in bipolar transistors decreases with increasing
temperature. This decrease in forward voltage drop
promotes diversion of the current to a single device
which can lead to device failure.The power Field Effect Transistor (FET) was
developed to solve the performance limitations of power
bipolar transistors. Power FETs are typically variants
of the Insulated Gate FET (IGFET) or the Metal
Insulator Semiconductor FET (MISFET). These device
types are commonly referred to as Metal Oxide
Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (MOSFET) because
they include a conducting gate electrode, typically
metal, that is separated from a semiconductor surface
by an intervening insulator, typically silicon dioxide.
Accordingly, all field effect transistors which use a
conducting gate electrode separated from a
semiconductor surface by an intervening insulator will
be referred to herein as MOSFETs.The power MOSFET applies a control signal to
the metal gate electrode that is separated from the
semiconductor surface by an oxide. Accordingly, the
control signal required is essentially a bias voltage
with no significant
