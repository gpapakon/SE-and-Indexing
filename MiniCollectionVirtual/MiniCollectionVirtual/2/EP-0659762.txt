<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel sialic acid derivatives having a
amido bond, or salts thereof, which are useful for treating various diseases
caused by disorder of cholinergic neurons.Senile dementia including Alzheimer's disease is a disease which
shows progressive amnesia and agnosia. In these diseases the salient
disorder is found in cholinergic nervous system which projects from basal
forebrain to cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Because these neurons show
remarkable reduction of acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme, choline
acetyltransferase (referred to as "ChAT" hereinafter), drugs which activate
ChAT activity are considered to be useful as therapeutic drugs for senile
dementia including Alzheimer's disease. Further, it is expected that drugs
having such activity are also useful as therapeutic drugs for peripheral
neuropathy.On the other hand, gangliosides i.e. glycosphingolipids including sialic
acid are a component of biomembranes and contained in brains of higher
animals in quantity. Because gangliosides, which have been recently reported
on their various functions, are found preferentially in membranes of neurons,
their role in neurons has been studied extensively. Sialic acid is an important
component of gangliosides, and various sialic acid derivatives have been 
synthesized for the purpose of investigating the correlation between the sialic
acid and ganglioside's function and its applications in medical field (Japanese
patent publication (Kokai) Nos. 89298/1980, 243096/1986, 282390/1986,
41492/1988, 41494/1988, 63697/1988, 68526/1988, 52794/1989, 190693/1989
and 151398/1991; and PCT patent publication Nos. W093/10134 and
W094/03469, etc.). Some reports have been made on the activity of the sialic
acid derivatives (Japanese patent publication (kokai) Nos. 265229/1987,
93529/1989, 77898/1991 and 81287/1991; and Brain Research, 438, 277 -
285 (1988)). However, derivatives which sufficiently increase ChAT activity
have not been developed yet.The inventors of the present invention have made extensive studies in
order to provide a therapeutic drug for diseases of central nervous system such
as senile dementia including Alzheimer's disease, and peripheral nervous
system. Consequently, they have discovered and found that sialic acid
derivatives with a specific amido bond are useful as therapeutic drugs which
alleviate diseases of central nervous system such as senile dementia including
Alzheimer's disease and diseases of peripheral nervous system such as
diabetic neuropathy, etc. The present
