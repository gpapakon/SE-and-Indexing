earth line (33) or a gate electrode (12a, 13a) of the load transistor 
(12, 13).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to semiconductor memories and
particularly to so-called stacked CMOS SRAMs in
which a load transistor of a flip-flop forming a memory cell is formed
of a semiconductor layer on a semiconductor substrate.In a resistance load MOS SRAM, which is the generally used
form of MOS SRAM, it is difficult to maintain a high memory retention
capacity with a low stand-by current.International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) Technical
Digest, 11-14 December 1988, San Francisco, CA, US, pages 48-51
discloses a Poly-Si PMOS Load SRAM cell. A low stand-by current is
achieved "using poly-Si PMOS loads and cross-coupled stacked
capacitors formed between the NMOS and the stacked poly-Si PMOS".A full CMOS SRAM having a memory cell shown in Figure 1 has
been proposed. Moreover, to reduce a chip area of the full CMOS SRAM
to that of a resistance load MOS SRAM, there has been proposed a
stacked CMOS SRAM wherein load PMOS transistors 12 and 13 of a flip-flop
11 forming a memory cell are formed by thin film transistors, and
these thin film transistors are stacked on driver NMOS transistors 14
and 15 and transfer NMOS transistors 16 and 17 formed by bulk
transistors (see, for example, "Nikkei Microdevice", September 1988,
pages 123 to 130).Figure 2 shows an example of such a stacked CMOS SRAM. In
this SRAM, impurity diffused regions 21a to 21g serving as
source/drain regions of the driver NMOS transistors 14 and 15 and
transfer NMOS transistors 16 and 17 are formed in a semiconductor
substrate. Gate electrodes 14a to 17a of the transistors 14 to 17
are formed by a first poly-Si layer on an insulating film (not shown)
on the semiconductor substrate. The gate electrodes 16a and 17a are
parts of a word line 22. The gate electrode 14a is connected to the
impurity diffused region 21d, and the gate electrode 15a is connected
to the impurity diffused regions 21b and 21f. The gate electrodes 14a
and 15a, the word line 22 and a surface of the semiconductor substrate
are covered with an insulating interlayer (not shown). The gate
electrodes 12a and 13a of the PMOS transistors 12 and 13 are formed by
a second poly-Si layer on this insulating interlayer.As described above, the gate electrodes 12a and 13a are made 
of a poly-Si layer different from that of the gate electrodes 14a and
15a, and can have a length different from that of the gate electrodes
14a and 15a, as is apparent from Figure 2.The gate electrodes 12a and 13a are respectively connected to
the gate electrodes 14a and 15a through contact holes 23 and 24
