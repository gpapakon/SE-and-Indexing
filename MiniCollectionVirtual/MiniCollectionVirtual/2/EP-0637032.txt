<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a parallel processor packaging structure and a 
method for manufacturing the structure. The individual 

logic and memory elements are on printed circuit cards. These 
printed circuit boards and cards are, in turn, mounted on or 

connected to circuitized flexible substrates extending outwardly 
from a laminate of the circuitized, flexible substrates. 

Intercommunication is provided through a switch structure that 
is implemented in the laminate. The printed circuit cards are 

mounted on or connected to a plurality of circuitized flexible 
substrates, with one printed circuit card at each end of the 

circuitized flexible circuit. The circuitized flexible 
substrates connect the separate printed circuit boards and cards 

through the central laminate portion. This laminate portion 
provides XY plane and Z-axis interconnection for inter-processor, 

inter-memory, inter-processor/memory element, and 
processor to memory bussing interconnection, and communication. 

The planar circuitization, as data lines, address lines, and 
control lines of a logic chip or a memory chip are on the 

individual printed circuit boards and cards, which are connected 
through the circuitized flex, and communicate with other layers 

of flex through Z-axis circuitization (vias and through holes) 
in the laminate.
