<ABSTRACT>
In a solid-state imaging device, a fixed pattern noise 
(FPN) of each pixel can be accurately and reliably canceled 

without using an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter and a memory 
having a large storage capacity. One ends of first and second 

sample and hold circuits (6a), (6b) are connected to vertical 
signal lines. A subtracter (10) is connected to the rear stage 

of the sample and hold circuits (6a), (6b) through a switching 
means (8) to thereby subtract a noise signal output from one of 

the first and second sample and hold circuits (6a), (6b) from a 
pixel signal outputted from the other sample and hold circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to solid-state imaging
devices and, more particularly, to an amplifying type solid-state
imaging device in which a fixed pattern noise (FPN) can be
canceled from a video signal formed from a pixel (i.e., pixel
signal).FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings shows an example
of a conventional amplifying type solid-state imaging device.As shown in FIG. 1, MOS (metal oxide semiconductor)
transistors Qe, Qe, ..., each having an annular-shaped gate,
form pixels. The MOS transistors Qe, Qe, ... are arranged in a
matrix of rows and columns (i.e., in a two-dimensional fashion).
Each of the MOS transistors Qe, Qe, ..., has an annular-shaped
gate. A drain provided at the outside of the annular-shaped gate
of the MOS transistor Qe is connected to a power supply (VDD
line) and a source provided at the inside of the annular-shaped
gate of the MOS transistor Qe is connected to signal lines. The
annular-shaped gate of the MOS transistor Qe is connected to
vertical scanning lines. The annular-shaped gate is made of
thin transparent polysilicon, and a channel current of the MOS
transistors Qe, Qe, ... is modulated by photoelectrically
converting light incident on the channel through the annular-shaped
gate. Horizontal switching transistors Qh, Qh, ..., are
connected between signal lines associated with vertical columns 
of pixels and output line in order to effect the horizontal
scanning.A vertical scanner (vertical scanning circuit) 1 is
adapted to scan horizontal rows of the pixels that are arranged
in a matrix fashion. A horizontal scanner (horizontal scanning
circuit) 2 is adapted to control the horizontal switching
transistors Qh, Qh, ... A signal of pixel which belongs to the
horizontal row scanned by the vertical scanner 1 and which
belongs to the column scanned by the horizontal scanner 2 is
outputted to the outside as an output signal of the amplifying
type solid-state imaging device.An analog-to-digital (A/D) converter 3 is provided in
the outside of the amplifying type solid-state imaging device.
The A/D converter 3 converts an output pixel signal from the
amplifying type solid-state imaging device into a digital
signal. A frame memory 4 is adapted to store therein one frame
of the output signal from the A/D converter 3. More
specifically, the frame memory 4 stores therein one frame of the
output signal from the A/D converter 3 in order to cancel a
noise signal (fixed pattern noise). In the following
description of the present invention, the fixed pattern noise
will be referred to
