<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the preparation of compounds of formula II, 
R is OH, from compounds of formula I, R is OH. The method disclosed in the 
present invention is novel and efficient. 
Compounds of formula II are used as intermediates in the synthesis of various 
biologically active molecules. The preparation of compounds of formula II from compounds of formula I, 
wherein R is always other than OH is known. For example, compounds of 
formula I wherein R is OMe or NH₂ when treated with compounds of formula III 
give compounds of formula II. However, the procedure described in the above 
prior art does not work with compound of formula I when R is OH. As disclosed above the transformation of compounds of formula I where in 
R is OH, to compounds of formula II is not successful.  Therefore, it is necessary to protect the carboxylic acid group of formula I 
wherein R is OH. Moreover, after the reaction, compounds of formula II wherein 
the carboxylic group is protected have to be deprotected. This involves 
additional steps. The present invention describes a direct method wherein 
separate protection and deprotection step are avoided. The present invention describes a process for the preparation of compounds of 
the formula II 
wherein
 
X stands for C₁-C₆-alkyl, C₃-C₆-alkenyl, C₃-C₆-alkynyl, C₃-C₇-cycloalkyl, 
cycloalkylalkyl, aralkyl, heterocycle or heteroalkyl group;
 
R(1) stands for hydrogen, carbobenzyloxy or tert-butyloxycarbonyl group. The term C₁-C₆-alkyl relates to straight-chain or branched chain saturated 
hydrocarbon radicals such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, t-butyl, pentyl, hexyl which 
are unsubstituted or substituted by a protected amino, hydroxy or a thiol group. The term C₃-C₆-alkenyl stands for straight or branched chain C₃-C₆-hydrocarbon 
radicals containing at least one unsaturation such as vinyl. The term alkynyl stands for straight or branched chain hydrocarbon radicals 
containing 3 to 6 carbons and containing at least one acetylenic bond.  The term C₃-C₇-cycloalkyl stands for saturated or unsaturated cyclic 
compounds, which may further be substituted by functional groups such as, 
C₁-C₃-alkyl, C₁-C₃-alkoxy, halogen. The term aryl stands for an aromatic nucleus preferably a phenyl group which is 
unsubstituted or substituted by 1, 2 or 3 identical or different substituents such 
as halogen, C₁-C₃-alkyl, C₁-C₃-alkoxy, C₃-C₆-alkenyl, nitro or heterocycle. The term aralkyl refers to a group such as a benzyl group. The term heterocycle stands for a cyclic structure containing one or
