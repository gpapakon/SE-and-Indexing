<ABSTRACT>
The device for fixing discs in a cutting wheel (2) for tunnel excavators comprises a cutting wheel (2) with recesses (5) through which bearing parts (3) can be pushed together with the discs. The bearing parts (3), which have an eccentric outline relative to the bearing axis (7) of the discs, are fixed in a recess (4) adjoining the axially parallel recess (5), a different position of the discs being obtained according to the rotary position of the bearing parts (3). Wedges (6) are provided for the fixing.

A device for mounting discs in cutting wheels of a
tunneling machine, wherein the cutting wheel (2) includes

recesses (5) through which the discs (1) and bearing parts (3)
may be passed and wherein the bearing parts (3) have contours

that are eccentric relative to the bearing axis (7) of the
discs (1), characterized in that, on the cutting wheel side

facing the work surface, recesses (4) for supporting the
bearing parts (3) on part of their peripheries are provided

beside the recesses (5) for the bearing parts (3) and that the
bearing parts (3) are capable of being fastened in the

recesses (4) so as to be secured against rotation in at least
two different rotary positions by at least one wedge (6).
A device for mounting discs in cutting wheels of a
tunneling machine according to claim 1, characterized in that

the bearing parts (3) have polygonal contours whose corners
are arranged at different distances from the bearing axis (7)

of the discs (1).
A device for mounting discs in cutting wheels of a
tunneling machine according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in

that the wedges (6) are connected with tension rods (8)
passing through the axially parallel recesses (5) and

cooperating with clamping elements (9) on the side (10) of the
cutting wheel (2), that faces away from the work surface.
A device for mounting discs in cutting wheels of a
tunneling machine according to any one of claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that the clear width of the axially parallel
recesses (5) is larger than the smallest width of the bearing

parts (3) and the largest cross section of the wedges (6)
extending transverse to the tension rod.
