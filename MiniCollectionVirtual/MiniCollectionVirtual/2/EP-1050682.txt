invention with a motor-driven fan the salient characteristics
of which are defined in the attached Claim 1.Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will
become apparent from the following detailed description,

motor of the motor-driven fan shown in Figure 1;Figure 3 is a partial representation in axial section,
of an alternative embodiment of the motor-driven fan
according to the invention; andFigure 4 is a partial axial sectional representation of
another alternative embodiment.With reference to Figure 1, a motor-driven fan 1 according to
the invention comprises a DC electric motor 2, in particular 
of the brushless type, and an impeller or fan 3 coupled to

10, having an essentially cup-shape form. In the embodiment
illustrated this cap 10 comprises a cylindrical or annular
wall 11 coaxial with the shaft 6, to the inner surface of
which are fixed permanent magnets 12. The cap 10 further
includes an end element 13, essentially in the form of a
apertured disc (see also Figure 2). The element 13 of the cap
has a plurality of quasi-radial peripheral projections 14
alternating, in angularly spaced relation with other radial
projections indicated 15.The projections 14 of the element 13 of the cap are shaped
and have respective apertures 16 (Figure 2) through which
extend projections 17 which protrude from the corresponding
edge of the ring 11 and are pressed over the projections 14
in order stably to anchor the element 13 to the ring 11 of
the cap.The projections 14 and 15 of the element 13 of the cap extend
from a main ring 18 of this element which is
