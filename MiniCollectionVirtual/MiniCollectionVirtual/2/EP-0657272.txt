<ABSTRACT>
A method for manufacturing a fiber reinforced elastic 

sheet by extruding and processing an elastomer containing 
staples by 25 volume % or less. The elastomer, which 

uniformly flows in a sheet width direction, passes through a 
slight clearance (6a) of a molding dice in the vertical direction 

of the sheet, and then the elastomer flow is enlarged in the 
vertical direction of the sheet. A flow adjustment portion (7) 

is provided in a passage of the elastomer to flow uniformly 
in the sheet width direction, and a weir portion (9) is provided 

on the downstream side of the flow adjustment portion. A 
clearance Wo of an outlet in the vertical direction of the 

sheet, a clearance Wi formed by the weir portion in the 
vertical direction of the sheet and a distance ℓ between 

the weir portion and the outlet have the relationship of


Wo / Wi ≧ 2 
ℓ ≧ 3Wo 
0.3 mm ≦ Wi ≦ 5 mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for manufacturing a fiber reinforced elastic elastomer
according to the preamble of claim 1 and to an apparatus according to the preamble of
claim 2.US-A-4,057,610 discloses a hose reinforced with discontinuous fibers oriented in the radial
direction and a method for preparing such a hose by extrusion, wherein a hollow cylindrical
die is used in which a mandrel is arranged. One embodiment of the known die is provided
with a mandrel in the hollow-cylindrical die, wherein a weir is provided in the ring channel of
the die. According to another embodiment, the ring channel of the die is enlarged in such a
way that the diameter of the mandrel is reduced and in the same way the diameter of the
hollow-cylindrical die is enlarged.It is an object of the present invention to easily manufacture a fiber-reinforced elastic hose in
which staples or discontinuous fibers, respectively, are oriented in the circumferential
direction.This object is achieved by the features in the characterising part of claim 1 and of claim 2.The cylindrical staple complex elastomer extruded from the ring groove of the expansion die
is unpressurized and is gradually extended circumferentially, so that the staples of the staple
complex elastomer are circumferentially oriented, while being extruded through the ring
groove of the expansion die.Consequently no shrinkage is caused, so that the circumferential orientation coefficient can be
increased.The invention is described in more detail in connection with the drawing, wherein the single
figure shows a section view of an expansion die. Indicated at 41 is an enlargement adaptor
which is connected to an expansion die 31. The enlargement
adaptor 41 is formed such that a cylindrical staple complex
elastomer E extruded from the expansion die 31 flows along
an outer peripheral surface 41a. The cylindrical staple
complex elastomer E is further extended circumferentially by
the enlargement adaptor 41. The outer peripheral surface
41a of the enlargement adaptor 41 has a diameter increased
with a suitable slope coaxially with a ring groove 32 of the
expansion die 31. The staple complex elastomer E is
circumferentially extended by the enlargement adaptor 41, so
that the circumferential staple orientation coefficient of
the staple complex elastomer E is further increased as
compared with the case where only the expansion die 31 is
utilized.The outer peripheral surface 41a of the enlargement
adaptor 41 has almost the same diameter as the inner
diameter of the outlet of
