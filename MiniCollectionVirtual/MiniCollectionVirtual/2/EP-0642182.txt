<ABSTRACT>
A granular-type magnetoresistive material is used to form a 
MR component, which is equipped in a magnetic head, or the like. 

When placing the magnetoresistive material in the external 
magnetic field, the electric resistance is altered responsive to 

a variation of the external magnetic field. In order to increase 
a magnetic-field sensitivity, the magnetoresistive material is 

composed of an alloy whose atomic composition is expressed by a 
chemical formula of (Co

1-y
, where 0.45≦ x≦ 0.55 and 
0.24≦ y≦ 0.35; or another chemical formula of

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetoresistive material 
whose electric resistance is altered responsive to a variation of 
a magnetic field externally produced. Conventionally, there are provided magnetoresistive 
materials whose electric resistance is altered responsive to the 
variation of the magnetic field externally produced. Such effect 
of the magnetoresistive materials is called "magnetoresistive 
effect" (or simply called as "MR effect"). The above-mentioned 
magnetoresistive materials are widely used, in the magnetic 
recording/reproducing apparatuses, for the magnetic heads, 
sensors which sense the magnetic field, and the like. The known 
alloyed-magnetoresistive materials such as the Ni-Fe alloy (i.e., 
Permalloy) are used as the magnetoresistive materials. In 
addition, the granular-type magnetoresistive materials, which 
have fine magnetic granules embedded in the conductive non-magnetic 
metals, are also known. According to the known 
granular-type magnetoresistive materials, cobalt (Co) is embedded 
in copper (Cu); cobalt (Co) is embedded in silver (Ag); or Fe-Co 
alloy is embedded in silver (Ag), for example. However, the known magnetoresistive materials described 
above suffer from the following drawbacks. In the alloyed-magnetoresistive materials such as the 
Permalloy, the saturation magnetization is relatively large. 
Thus, when being applied to the magnetic head or sensor, the 
width of the magnetoresistive member (i.e., width of the 
magnetoresistive wire) should be reduced in order to improve the  
 
resolution. In that case, the effect of the demagnetizing field 
becomes large, which results in the reduction of the sensitivity 
for the detection of the magnetic filed. This phenomenon can be 
explained in detail by referring to FIGS. 7A and 7B. In those 
drawings, there is provided a magnetoresistive member 10 to which 
the magnetic anisotropy is imparted in its longitudinal 
direction. Under the condition where electric currents are 
applied to the magnetoresistive member 10 along longitudinal 
direction, an external magnetic field 'Hex', which is crossing 
the magnetoresistive member 10 in a direction perpendicular to 
the longitudinal direction, can be detected. In this case, as 
shown in FIG. 7B, magnetization M, which is caused due to the 
external magnetic field Hex in the magnetoresistive member 10, 
acts as demagnetizing field Hd which is produced in a direction 
inverse to the direction of the external magnetic field Hex. 
Thus, the external magnetic field Hex is
