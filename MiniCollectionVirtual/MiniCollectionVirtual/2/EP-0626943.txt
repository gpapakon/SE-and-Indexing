<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of
bistriazene compounds as chemotherapeutic agents useful in
the treatment of various cancers. As such, these compounds
find wide utility in both human and veterinary medicine.
The invention also relates to the use of these compounds as
crosslinking reagents useful in a wide variety of
laboratory and chemical applications involving the
synthesis and manipulation of polymeric macromolecules.A number of chemotherapeutic agents exist which act as
alkylating agents capable of forming covalent linkages with
a variety of substances, including phosphate groups in DNA.
Alkylation of bases in DNA often leads to gene miscoding,
serious damage to the DNA molecule, and/or major disruption
in nucleic acid function, and results in the inhibition of
a wide range of other cellular functions. These agents act
by forming lethal crosslinks in nucleic acid molecules, and
can often shrink tumors in a matter of days after
intravenous administration. Among these compounds are 2-chloroethyl-nitrosoureas
such as bis(2-chloroethyl)nitrosourea
(BCNU), mitomycin, cyclophosphamide
(cytoxan), and ifosphamide. These agents are themselves
potentially mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic, and
their anti-neoplastic activity is exerted throughout the
cell cycle, i.e., toxicity is cell cycle independent. Vaughan et al. (1984) Jour. Med. Chem. 27:357-63 have
reported the formation of a certain bistriazene as a by-product
in the preparation of other triazenes. This
bistriazene is chemically and structurally different from
those of the present invention, and was not tested for
antitumor activity. Furthermore, this bistriazene differs
from those of the present invention in that it would
require two-fold metabolic activation to release the same
alkylating moiety, and is susceptible to hydrolysis,
thereby releasing monotriazenes.The use of the bistriazene compounds of the instant
invention as chemotherapeutic and crosslinking agents has
yet to be reported.The bistriazene compounds of the present invention are
novel alkylating agents which are structurally similar to
polyamines such as spermine and spermidine, which interact
with DNA. Most currently employed chemotherapeutic
alkylating agents interact covalently or noncovalently with
the target DNA, after which a crosslinking reaction may
occur. The bistriazene compounds of the present invention
differ from any known chemotherapeutic agents in that their
chemical structure allows them to interact with the DNA
molecule while maintaining their chemical
