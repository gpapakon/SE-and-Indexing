A steering wheel for motor vehicles, in which the rim (3), spokes (2), and the means of 
impact protection (4) arranged in the areas above the wheel hub, are covered by a layer of 

polyurethane foam with a compacted skin (integral skin) or thermoplastic material such as 
PVC or PP, and in which, in the passenger compartment side of the layer, in the area of the 

spokes and/or the means of impact protection, at least one momentary contact switch (5) is 
integrated, connected to an electromechanical rotary transformer, characterised in that the 

momentary contact switch (5) consists ofa contact surface (10) on the steering wheel side, 
a semi-conductor polymer film (8) located directly on this, and a conductor path film (9) 

located directly on this on the passenger compartment side, and is connected to an 
electronic comparator (7).
