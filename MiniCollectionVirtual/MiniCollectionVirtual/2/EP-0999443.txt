<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a capillary electrophoretic apparatus
comprising a capillary electrophoretic part electrophoresing a sample injected
into an end of a capillary column and detection means detecting each
component separated in the capillary column at an appropriate position of the
capillary column, and inclusively, it relates to a method and an apparatus
characterized in sample injection into a capillary column.Besides having those that comprise a single capillary column, capillary
electrophoretic apparatuses also have a multi-capillary electrophoretic
apparatus comprising a multi-capillary array migration part including a plurality
of capillary columns for injecting a plurality of samples one by one into the
capillary columns and simultaneously electrophoresing the samples in all
capillary columns and an optical measuring part irradiating the capillary
columns with light in the multi-capillary array migration part for measuring
absorbance by the samples on the irradiated portion or fluorescence from the
samples.The capillary columns include those charged and not charged with gels
for migration.A capillary electrophoretic apparatus is applied for the separation of
protein, and sequence determination for DNA. When applied to sequence
determination for DNA, the capillary electrophoretic apparatus employs
Sanger's reaction, electrophoreses a DNA fragment sample prepared by
labeling a primer or a terminator with a fluorescent material and detects
fluorescence from the DNA fragment sample during migration for determining
the base sequence.A DNA sequencer having high sensitivity, a high speed and high 
throughput is necessary for sequence determination for DNA having long base
sequence such as a human genome. As one method, a multi-capillary DNA
sequencer prepared by arranging a plurality of capillary columns in place of
that employing a flat plate type slab gel is proposed. With such a capillary
column, a sample can not only be readily handled or injected but also migrated
at a high speed and detected in high sensitivity, when compared to the slab gel.
If a high voltage is applied to the slab gel, a band is spread or a temperature
gradient is caused due to influence by Joulean heat However, the capillary
column hardly causes such problems and can perform detection in high
sensitivity with small band spreading even if performing high-speed migration
with application of a high voltage.In capillary electrophoresis, a sample is injected into a capillary column
under pressure or with application of
