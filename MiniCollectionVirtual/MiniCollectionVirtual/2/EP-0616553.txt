<ABSTRACT>
In order to produce a mixture of at least two samples in exact proportions, the invention calls for sample containers (1, 3) whose capacities, up to an overflow (18, 19), are in the same ratio as that of the required mixture. After filling the containers to the overflows, their contents are allowed to flow into a common mixing container (14). The ratio of the components in the mixing container is exactly the same as the ratio of the capacities of the individual component containers up to their respective overflows.

Method for the production of a mixture of exact 
proportions between at least two samples using 

containers (1, 3), the capacity of which up to an 
overflow (18, 19) is in the same proportion as the 

desired mixture proportion, wherein the samples to be 
mixed are filled, without being measured, separately 

into the containers, until an excess quantity of the 
sample spills over the overflow, and the contents of 

the sample containers which have been filled up to the 
overflows are put into a common mixture container 

(14). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised by the 
use of sample containers (1, 3) of differing or 

variable capacities up to the overflow (18, 19). 
Method for the production of a mixture of exact 
proportions between at least two samples using a 

container (1'), the capacity of which up to an 
overflow (18') is variable, so that the varied  

 
capacity is in the desired mixture proportion to the 

original capacity, wherein the samples to be mixed are 
filled in succession into the container, without being 

measured, until an excess quantity of the samples 
spills over the overflow, and the contents of the 

sample container which has been filled up to the 
overflow with a sample are put into a common mixture 

container (14). 
Method for the production of a mixture of exact 
proportions between at least two samples, wherein a 

first sample is filled, without being measured, up to 
an overflow into a container (14) of predetermined 

capacity, until an excess quantity of the sample 
spills over the overflow, the capacity of the 

container up to the overflow is increased so that the 
new container volume is in the same proportion to the 

original container volume as the desired mixture 
proportion, and a second sample is introduced into the 

container, without being measured, until an excess 
quantity of the sample spills over the overflow. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4 for the 
dilution of activated sludge with clean water for the 

purpose of determining the volume of sludge, after the 
sludge has collected in the mixture container.  

 
Device for carrying out the method according to 
Claim 1 or 2, characterized by at least two sample 

containers (1, 3), the capacities of which up to an 
overflow (18, 19) are in the same proportion as the 

mixture proportions of the samples to be produced, and 
by a mixture container (14) to receive the contents of 

the sample containers which have been filled up to the 
overflow. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in that 
the capacity of a sample container (1, 3) is variable 

by varying the height of the overflow (18, 19). 
Device for carrying out the method according to 
Claim 3, characterised by a sample container (1') with 

an overflow (18'), the capacity of which up to the 
overflow may be varied, and by a mixture container 

(14) to receive the contents of the sample container 
which has been filled up to the overflow. 
Device for carrying out the method according to 
Claim 4, characterised by a mixture container (14) 

with an overflow (17), the capacity of which up to the 
overflow is variable. 
Device according to Claim 9, characterised in 
that the mixture container (14) is a cylinder with a 

plunger (23) which may be moved in the cylinder.  
 
Device according to Claim 10, characterised in 
that the cylinder (14) is formed slim relative to its 

diameter to prevent a premature mixing of the samples. 
Device according to one of Claims 9 to 11, 
characterised by a computer control with input 

keyboard to vary the capacity of the mixture container 
corresponding to a mixture proportion being fed in. 
Device according to one of Claims 6 to 8, 
characterised in that, in the inlet of the sample 

containers (1, 3) or sample container, a time-controlled 
pump (7, 9) is arranged and, in the outlet 

of the sample containers to the mixture container 
(14), a control valve (12, 3) is arranged. 
Device according to Claim 13 for the dilution of 
activated sludge with clean water, characterised in 

that a feed pump (7) is arranged in a side-branch (6) 
of the activated sludge inlet (2) to the sample 

container (1) and is connected to this inlet via a 
control valve (5). 
Device according to Claim 13 or 14 for the 
dilution of activated sludge with clean water, with at 

least two sample containers, characterised by a 
connecting line (11) to the activated sludge inlet 

(2), which connecting line is joined to the clean 
water inlet (4) via a control valve (10).
