<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing polycarbonate powder readily by ejecting a mixture of a solution of polycarbonate in an organic 
solvent with steam through a mixing nozzle, wherein a lowness of the bulk density of the powder, which has been a shortcoming 

of the conventional processes using a mixing nozzle, can be remedied without causing any increase in the amount of a residual 
solvent by using a 3-45 wt.% solution of polycarbonate in an organic solvent and adjusting the ratio of the weight (Ws) of the 

steam to the weight (Wo) of the organic solvent in the solution to 1/10 to 1/5.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the
production of a polycarbonate powder, and particularly to a
process for the production of a polycarbonate powder having
a high bulk density.The process for the production of a polycarbonate
includes a melt polycondensation method (transesterification
method) and an interfacial polycondensation method (phosgene
method), and the interfacial polycondensation method is
industrially preferably employed.In the process for the production of a
polycarbonate based on the interfacial polycondensation
method, an emulsion obtained by an interfacial
polycondensation reaction is subjected to washing and
separation procedures to obtain an organic solvent solution
of a polycarbonate (the solvent is generally methylene
chloride). Then, the polycarbonate is isolated (recovered)
as a powder or particles from the obtained organic solvent
solution. Thereafter, the so-obtained polycarbonate is
molded in the form of pellets, or the like, as required.As a simple method for recovering a polycarbonate
as a powder from an organic solvent solution, there is known
a method in which the organic solvent solution and steam are
introduced into an ejector nozzle (mixing nozzle), the
mixture ejected from the ejector nozzle is introduced
through a tubing into a separator, and a polycarbonate
powder is recovered with the separator (JP-B-63-1333, 
JP-B-2-6561 and U. S. Patent3,508,339). For recovering the
polycarbonate powder by the above method, the ratio (WS/WO)
of the weight of the steam (WS) and the weight of the
organic solvent (WO) in the organic solvent solution of the
polycarbonate is set to be greater than 1/5, and the steam
and the organic solvent solution are introduced into the
mixing nozzle.The above method has an advantage in that a
polycarbonate having a less residual solvent content can be
facilely recovered in the form of powder as compared with a
method in which a poor solvent is added to an organic
solvent solution of a polycarbonate (JP-B-42-14474), a
kneader-applied pulverization method taking advantage of the
crystallization of an organic solvent solution of a
polycarbonate (JP-B-53-15899) or a method in which an
organic solvent solution of a polycarbonate is poured into a
hot water (Japanese Patent Application No. 60-115625). US-A-4209912 discloses a process for drying resinous materials which
comprises a) forming a superheated solution of the resinous material and b)
spraying the superheated solution through one or more venturi shaped
nozzles at high pressures or
