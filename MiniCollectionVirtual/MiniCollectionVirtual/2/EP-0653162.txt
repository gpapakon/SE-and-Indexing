<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a strain belonging to the 
genus Colletotrichum, an agent for killing plants of the genus Poa 
and a method for killing plants of the genus Poa by the use of said 
strain, which is particularly effective for killing troublesome weed 
annual bluegrass (Poaannua L.) in turf. Annual bluegrass, a troublesome weed in turf e.g. in a golf 
course, a park etc., has been controlled mainly by means of 
chemical herbicides by and sometimes pulling out it by hand in a 
golf course. Recently, frequently applying a large amount of chemical 
herbicides in a golf course etc. causes an environmental pollution 
and organic farming without the use of any chemicals draws 
consumer's attention. Under the circumstances, biological 
pesticides are widely studied with interest because of less 
influence on the environment. In herbicide, plant-pathogenic 
organisms have been studied as the means of controlling weeds. The 
principal features of plant-pathogenic organisms as agents for 
herbicides lie in less adverse effects on crop plants and the least 
influence on the environment. As a conventional weed-killer 
intended for use in turf, mention may be made of a plant-pathogenic 
bacterium Xanthomonascampestris suppressing the propagation of 
annual bluegrass i.e. a troublesome weed of the family Gramineae 
(Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 502438/1988). At  
 
present, Devine® (a product of Abbott Labs) for killing 
Stranglervine (Morreniaodorata) and Collego® (a product of 
Ecogen Inc.) for killing northern jointvetch (Aeschynomene 
virginica) are commercially available in the United States. A wide variety of means have been attempted in the prior art 
as described to control annual bluegrass. Whereas the control of the weeds by pulling out them by hand 
needs much labor, the control by a chemical herbicide does not need 
much labor, but there is not only a danger of environmental 
pollution etc. but also the adverse effect of the chemical on the 
turf, so the chemical herbicide can be used only before (or at the 
early stage of) the germination of annual bluegrass, and it is not 
effective to grown annual bluegrass. In contrast, the control by the plant-pathogenic bacterium 
Xanthomonascampestris does not need much labor and is effective 
to grown annual bluegrass, too. However, since Xanthomonas 
campestris (NRRL-B-18078) is a bacterium, it is necessary for the 
target weed annual bluegrass to be artificially cut for its 
application. Furthermore, a relatively higher temperature of
