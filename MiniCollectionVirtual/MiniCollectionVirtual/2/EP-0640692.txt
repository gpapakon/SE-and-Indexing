<ABSTRACT>
Methods for preparing magnetic strips are provided 
in which the strips are manufactured to a thickness of less 

than about 0.005 inches and are made of a ferrous alloy 
having a carbon content of from about 0.4 to about 1.2 weight 

percent. The strips are prepared by first manufacturing an 
alloy having a carbon content below about 0.5 weight percent 

to the desired thickness and then subjecting the strip to a 
carburizing step to raise the carbon content in the strip.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to permanent magnetic
strips and processes for their preparation. More
particularly the invention relates to relatively thin
magnetic strips, those having a thickness of below about 0.13 mm
(0.005 inches).Certain metallic alloy compositions are known for
their magnetic properties. Various applications exist for
the use of such alloys within industry. The rapidly
expanding use of such alloys has also extended into such
markets as electronic article surveillance systems. Many of
these newer markets require alloys with superior magnetic
properties at reduced costs such that the items within which
they are employed can be discarded subsequent to their use.The metallic alloy compositions that constitute
permanent magnets are characterized by various performance
properties such as coercive level, Hc, and residual
induction, Br. The coercive level is a measure of the
resistance of the magnet to demagnetization and the residual
induction is a measure of the level of induction possessed by
a magnet after saturation and removal of the magnetic field.Superior magnetic properties can be obtained by
using a ferrous alloy containing chromium and cobalt.
However, the presence of cobalt typically makes such alloys 
prohibitively expensive and thus impractical in various end
uses.Certain of the newer magnetic markets further
require the preparation of the alloy into a relatively thin
strip of material such that the magnetic properties are
provided in an economical fashion. As the demand for
increasingly thin magnetic strips increases, the selection
metallic alloys possessing the required magnetic properties
while also possessing the necessary machinability and
workability characteristics to provide the desired shapes,
becomes exceedingly difficult. For example, ferrous alloys
having carbon contents of about 1 weight percent and chromit
contents of about 3-5 weight percent have been shown to
exhibit advantageous magnetic properties. However these
alloys are mechanically hard and cannot be rolled easily to
the required thickness due to either initial hardness or hig
levels of work hardening during processing.A need therefore exists in the permanent magnet art
for thin magnetic strips having superior magnetic properties
without the need for cobalt and other expensive components i
the alloy compositions constituting the magnetic strip. The
magnetic strips should be made from alloy compositions which
are amenable to processing of the alloy into the thin strips
required by many industrial uses,
