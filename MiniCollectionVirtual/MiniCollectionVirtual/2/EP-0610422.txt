<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method are disclosed for detecting and locating the origin of a gamma ray in a medical diagnostic imaging system. At least one primary fiber, which is a scintillating optical fiber, is positioned to receive radiation from a gamma ray source. At least one secondary fiber intersects the primary fiber at a non-zero angle and is in optical contact with the primary fiber. Both the primary and secondary fibers are provided with means for detecting light propagated in the fibers. The interaction of a gamma ray with the primary fiber will result in the propagation of light in both the primary and secondary fibers, thereby permitting the determination of the site of impact of the gamma ray in the detector, and possibly also enabling the determination of the path of incidence of the gamma ray.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for 
locating the origin of a gamma ray in an imaging system. 
In particular, this invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for determining the origin of a gamma ray as part 
of a technique of imaging internal organs in a living 
subject. There are many situations in medicine where it is 
desirable to obtain images of a patient's internal organs 
or body functions. The imaging technology that is used to 
do this includes a variety of techniques such as magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT), 
single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), and 
positron emission tomography (PET). Generally speaking, in PET, a radionuclide is 
administered internally to a living subject. A positron 
from the decaying radionuclide encounters and annihilates 
with an electron, resulting in a pair of 511 keV 
annihilation photons which are emitted in exactly opposite 
(180°) directions from the annihilation site in the 
subject. By arranging banks of scintillation detectors all 
around the subject, the origin of the gamma ray can be 
determined. Substantially simultaneous detection of 
photons in opposingly situated detectors defines the site 
of the positron-electron annihilation as lying somewhere 
along a line directly between the opposing detectors.  
 
Typical PET scanners or tomographs include complex 
computerized data systems for collecting the information 
obtained and using it to reconstruct an image of the target 
organ, using mathematical techniques similar to those 
employed in computerized tomography. The radioactive isotopes used in PET include, but are 
not limited to, 18F, which has a half-life of approximately 
110 minutes, 11C (half-life of approximately 20 minutes), 
13N (half-life of approximately 10 minutes), and 15O (half-life 
of approximately 2 minutes). Because of the 
relatively short half-lives of the radioisotopes used, they 
are typically produced in an on-site cyclotron or other 
particle accelerator. Other nuclides exist which have 
either a long half life or a parent with long half life. 
These can be used without on-site cyclotrons, but they have 
generally less desirable chemical or physical 
characteristics. The practical need for an on-site 
cyclotron dramatically increases the cost of PET and 
therefore has limited the number of such systems in place. In contrast, in SPECT, a single photon is emitted from 
a radionuclide at a site in the patient's body. The photon 
is again detected by scintillating
