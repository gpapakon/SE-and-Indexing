<ABSTRACT>
The object of bonding rubbers and polyamides strongly to one another is old and has hitherto been achieved by various methods, none of which is totally satisfactory. The invention describes a process for the production of articles from at least two parts, strongly bonded to one another, of vulcanisates on the one hand and polyamides (nylons) on the other, where the vulcanisate is prepared under conventional vulcanisation conditions in contact with the polyamide moulding by vulcanisation of a rubber compound containing the following components:     I. 100 parts by weight of a rubber,   II. from 0 to 300 parts by weight of fillers,   III. from 0 to 150 parts by weight of plasticisers,   IV. from 1 to 10 parts by weight of peroxidic vulcanising agents,   V. from 0 to 4 parts by weight of vulcanisation activators and VI. from 1 to 10 parts by weight of a silane containing double bonds.     The articles obtained by this process have strong part-to-part adhesion; they are therefore suitable for a multiplicity of different technical (industrial) articles.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of articles of at least
two component pieces, firmly bonded to one another,

comprising a vulcanizate on the one hand and a
thermoplastic or a fibre composite material with a

polyamide matrix on the other hand, the thermoplastic
being a polyamide, a polyamide moulding composition or

a polyamide blend, characterized in that

a) the thermoplastic or the polyamide matrix comprises
at least 30% by weight of polyamide

and
b) the vulcanizate is prepared under customary
vulcanization conditions in contact with the

polyamide shaped article by vulcanization of a
rubber compound which comprises the following

components:

I. 100 parts by weight of a rubber which
comprises no carboxyl or anhydride

groups,
II. from 0 to 200 parts by weight of
fillers,
III. from 0 to 100 parts by weight of
plasticizers,
IV. from 1 to 5 parts by weight of
peroxidic vulcanizing agents,
V. from 0 to 4 parts by weight of vulcanization
activators and
VI. from 1 to 10 parts by weight of a
silane of the formula 



wherein

R
1
 is any desired divalent radical or a direct
bond, while
R
2
 denotes hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl, in
each case optionally substituted and having in each

case not more than 20 C atoms; and
R
3
, R
4
 and R
5
 independently of one another have the
same meaning as R
2
 or denote a group -COOR
2
.
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that
from 2 to 6 parts by weight of the silane per 100

parts by weight of rubber are employed.
A process according to any one of the preceding
claims, charac
terized in that the silane is of the
vinyltrimethoxysilane, vinyl-tris(2-methoxyethoxy)silane

or 3-methacryloxypropyl-trimethoxysilane type.
A process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the rubber is an EP(D)M

rubber, E-SBR, S-SBR, BR, NR, IR, IIR, CIIR, BIIR,
NBR, CR, a styrene-containing block copolymer and/or

a polyalkenylene.
A process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the rubber comprises

from 30 to 100 parts by weight of an EP(D)M rubber and
from 70 to 0 parts by weight of other rubbers.
A process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the rubber compound

furthermore comprises a vulcanization retardant, an
anti-ageing agent, a processing auxiliary, a mould 

release agent and/or a blowing agent.
A process according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the composite is

prepared in a one-stage procedure or in a two-stage
procedure, the material temperature of the rubber

mixture in the cylinder being in the range from 40 to
80°C and the mould temperature being in the range from

140 to 200°C.
A composite article produced according to any one of
the preceding claims.
