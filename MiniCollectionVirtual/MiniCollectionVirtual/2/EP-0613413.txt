<ABSTRACT>
A foreign substances-containing layer of a disk-shaped information carrier (3) is mechanically removed from the substrate material (13) in order to recover the substrate material (13) by a material removing process which separates the coating containing the foreign substances (18, 19, 20) from the substrate material (13). A device for implementing this process consists of a tool bottom part (1), a receptacle (2) for holding in place the disk-shaped information carrier (3), and a tool top part (7) movable with respect to the tool bottom part (1) in a direction parallel to the surface of the latter and provided with a blade (8) for peeling a layer (9) off the surface of the disk-shaped information carrier (3).

Process for mechanically removing foreign substances 
from the base material (13) of a disc-shaped 

information carrier (3), particularly an optically 
readable information carrier, to recover the base 

material (13), characterized in that the coating 
containing the foreign substances (18, 19, 20) is 

removed from the base material (13) by means of a 
chip-removing cut and in that in the course of the cut 

the disc-shaped information carrier (3) is pressed 
into a mounting (2) for positional fixing from its 

upper side bearing the foreign substances (18, 19, 
20). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the cut extends over the entire width of the disc-shaped 

information carrier (3). 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the upper side of the information carrier (3) 

having the foreign substances (18, 19, 20) is 
moistened before the cut. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that a cutting angle (α1, - α2) of 

+/- 10° is used. 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized by the use 
of a negative cutting angle (- α2). 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the information carrier (3) is 

additionally held in the mounting (2) with suction 
devices (6) engaging on the underside.  

 
Device for implementing the process according to one 
of Claims 1 to 6, comprising a tool lower part (1) 

with a mounting (2) for fixing the disc-shaped 
information carrier (3), a tool upper part (7) which 

is displaceable with respect to the tool lower part 
(1) parallel to its surface and which has a knife (8) 

scraping off a layer (9) from the surface of the disc-shaped 
information carrier (3) and a holding-down 

device (10) which is guided on the surface of the 
disc-shaped information carrier (3) and is arranged in 

front of the knife (8) in the cutting direction (X). 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in that the 
knife (8) has a width which is greater than or equal 

to the diameter of the disc-shaped information carrier 
(3). 
Device according to Claim 7 or 8, characterized by an 
additional holding-down device (11) following the 

knife (8). 
Device according to one of Claims 7 to 9, 
characterized in that the holding-down device (10, 11) 

has the width of the knife (8). 
Device according to Claim 10, characterized in that 
the holding-down device (10, 11) has a minimum length 

which corresponds to the diameter of the information 
carrier (3) in terms of order of magnitude. 
Device according to one of Claims 7 to 11, 
characterized in that the arrangement comprising 

holding-down device (10, 11) and knife (8) can be 
lowered onto the surface of the information carrier 

(3) perpendicular to it prior to the movement in 
cutting direction (X).  

 
Device according to one of Claims 7 to 12, 
characterized in that the cutting edge (12) of the 

knife (8) has a defined projection determining the 
cutting depth (S) with respect to the preceding 

holding-down device (10). 
Device according to one of Claims 7 to 13, 
characterized in that the depth of the mounting (2) is 

smaller than the minimum thickness of the information 
carrier (3) minus the cutting depth (S). 
Device according to one of Claims 7 to 14, 
characterized by vacuum lines (6) which are formed in 

the tool lower part (1) and open into the bottom of 
the mounting (2). 
Device according to one of Claims 7 to 15, 
characterized in that the mounting (2) has a central 

centring bolt (4) projecting into a central opening 
(5) of the inserted disc-shaped information carrier 

(3).
