<ABSTRACT>
In order to electrically compensate signal distortions in an optical telecommunication system caused by laser chirp and fibre dispersion, a correction signal is derived from the electric transmission and/or reception signal by squaring followed by differentiation, and is then added to the electric transmission or reception signal after being attenuated as required.

Method for electric compensation of signal 
distortion in an optical telecommunication system caused 

by laser chirp and fibre dispersion, characterized in 
that a correction signal is derived from the electric 

transmission signal by squaring followed by differentiation 
and is added to the electric transmission signal 

after a level correction necessary per se in the form of 
a signal attenuation. 
Method for electric compensation of signal 
distortion in an optical telecommunication system caused 

by laser chirp and fibre dispersion, particularly according 
to Claim 1, characterized in that a correction signal 

is derived from the electric reception signal by squaring 
followed by differentiation and is added to the electric 

reception signal after a level correction necessary per 
se in the form of a signal attenuation. 
Circuit arrangement for electric compensation of 
signal distortion in an optical telecommunication system 

caused by laser chirp and fibre dispersion, characterized 
in that, branching from the electric transmission signal 

path (s) is a correction signal path (k) which has a 
squaring element (Q) and a downstream differentiating 

element (D) and opens out again into the electric signal 
path (s) after a downstream level correction circuit (A) 

via an adding input. 
Circuit arrangement for electric compensation of 
signal distortion in an optical telecommunication system 

caused by laser chirp and fibre dispersion, particularly 
according to Claim 3, characterized in that, branching  

 
from the electric reception signal path (e) is a 

correction signal path (k) which has a squaring element 
(Q) and a downstream differentiating element (D) and 

opens out again into the electric signal path (e) after 
a downstream level correction circuit (A) via an adding 

input. 
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that a level adapting circuit (P) is 

connected upstream of the squaring element (Q) in the 
correction signal path (k).
