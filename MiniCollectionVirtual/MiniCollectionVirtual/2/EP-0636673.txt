<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel ferroelectric 
chiral smectic liquid crystal mixture and a liquid crystal element 
comprising the same. In particular, the present invention relates to 
a novel liquid crystal mixture having an improved contrast ratio and 
memory capability, and a liquid crystal element comprising the same 
which can be used in an optical shutter or a display device. With the recent progress of the information society, 
importance of a display device as one of man-machine interfaces has 
been greatly increased. Among such display devices, a flat panel 
display device such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) is quickly spread 
since it has various advantages such as a thin thickness, a light 
weight, a low driving voltage, a low power demand, and the like. 
Among the liquid crystal devices represented by the liquid crystal 
display, a matrix-addressed liquid crystal device having a large capacity 
of information includes two types of driving systems, namely an 
active-matrix-addressed system and a passive-matrix-addressed 
system. In the active-matrix-addressed system, a thin film transistor 
or diode made of polysilicon or amorphous silicon is connected 
to each picture element as a non-linear element. However, the active-matrix-addressed 
system may have some problems in assembling a 
large area display, lowering a production cost or increasing a density  
 
because of complicated production steps and low yield. In view of 
the cost and productivity, the passive-matrix-addressed system is 
advantageous. As liquid crystal devices of the passive-matrix-addressed 
LC display which are currently practically used, TN liquid crystal 
and STN liquid crystal devices are mainly used. However, their optical 
response utilizes an average orientation of a molecule axis of the 
liquid crystal in a specific direction based on anisotropy of a dielectric 
constant of the liquid crystal molecule, which is caused by the 
application of an electric field. Then, a limit of an optical response 
speed of such devices is in the order of millisecond, and such response 
speed is insufficient in view of the increase of an amount of 
information. When the number of scanning lines is increased to increase 
the capacity of information, the decrease of the contrast ratio 
or cross-talk cannot be avoided inevitably. Those are the essential 
problems since the TN or STN liquid crystal device has no memory 
property (bistability). To solve such problems, various driving 
methods such as a dual frequency driving
