<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing an oil sorbent excellent in oil sorptivity 
and water repellency and a device preparing the same are disclosed. 

The process for preparing an oil sorbent comprises mechanically 
fibrillating, or shredding and grinding lignocellulose material 

while substantially maintaining cell structure; and heating the 
resultant at a temperature of 250 to 450°C or 350 to 400°C for a 

predetermined period of time; followed by predetermined cooling to 
form an oil sorbent. The device for continuously preparing an oil 

sorbent having such a basic structure that three pipes with a 
"ellipse-shaped" cross-section each of which includes therein a 

screw type transferring means are arranged on top of one another, and 
the heating and the cooling are effected externally.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing an oil
sorbent and an oil sorbent obtainable by such a process. The
invention further relates to a device for continuously preparing
an oil sorbent.As seen from the Gulf War, stranding of an oil tanker and the like,
marine pollution with an oil makes severe environmental disruption.
Pollution due to an oil floating on or suspending in an industrial
or domestic waste water also makes cumbersome problem. The present
invention relates to an oil sorbent for efficiently adsorbing an oil
which cause such pollutions.With respect to collection and removal an oil floating on water
therefrom, various methods are known, for example, a method which
comprises pumping a mixture water with an oil, followed by 
emulsification with an emulsifier. Of these, a method which
comprises causing a floating oil to be captured by means of an oil
sorbent to effect collection and removal of the oil is the most
simple and effective method.Those used as such an oil sorbent for an oil floating on water are
required to be good in hydrophobicity as well as in lipophilicity.
As the material having such properties, synthetic resins such as a
polypropylene and a polyurethane are widely used. As natural
materials, there have been proposed one obtained by rendering a
hydrophilic lignocellulose hydrophobic (Japanese Examined Patent
Publication No.23702/1969), a ground wood piece having its surface
sized with a paraffin wax (Japanese Examined Patent Publication
No.15279/1979), one obtained by binding a polyvalent metal salt with
a phosphoric acid-treated pulp and causing the polyvalent metal salt
to be retained with a paraffin wax (Japanese Examined Patent
Publication No.51386/1985), and a carbonized cellulosic fiber
(Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.5893/1974). Further,
since silky fibers of a seed of a kapok tree which grows in Southeast
Asia (Java cotton) are highly hydrophobic and adequately lipophilic,
Java cotton fixedly adhered to a polyethylene or polypropylene
matrix is also known (Japanese Examined Patent Publication 
No.8033/1985).Moreover, the applicant of the present application has previously
filed a patent application relating to an oil sorbent which enables
drawbacks inherent in such conventional inventions to be remedied
(Japanese Patent Application No.70672/1993).An oil sorbent for adsorbing an oil floating on water is required
not only to have excellent adsorptivity as described above but also
to be guaranteed in availability for its starting material,
