<ABSTRACT>
A method for epoxidizing olefins is provided wherein an olefin and an 
oxygenating agent are 
contacted together in the presence of a manganese complex 
catalyst having at least one manganese atom coordinated with a nitrogen-containing 

ligand such that the manganese atom to coordinated nitrogen atom is 1:3 and 
thereafter isolating the resultant epoxide product. Catalyst compositions are also 

provided formed from the adsorption of the manganese complex catalyst onto a 
solvent insoluble support.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for epoxidizing olefins and catalysts
employed therefor.A variety of manganese compounds have been known for activating oxidation
of unsaturated bonds. GB 2 225 963A (Casson et al) describes a manganese
porphyrin supported on an inorganic substrate. The composition was indicated as
useful for epoxidation-of aromatics such as styrene. DE 34 38 484 (Rohde) describes
the combination of a transition metal, phthalocyanine, and iodosobenzene as a useful
epoxidation reagent.JP 60 197 664A (Tabuse) reports epoxidation of polyenes through contact with
a metal porphyrin, imidazole compound, platinum and hydrogen. Various solvents
including water are suggested as effective media. In J.Am.Chem.Soc., 108 (1986), pages 2309-2320 cationic manganese (III) complexes
of the salen ligand [N,N'-ethylenebis(salycideneaminato)] are reported to be effective
catalysts for the epoxidation of various olefins with iodosylbenzene as the terminal
oxident. Also reported is a derivative of the pentacoordinating ligand saldiene.
Tetrahydron Letters, 21, (1980), pages 4449-4450 discloses the epoxidation of styrene
with sodium hypochlorite using as a catalyst certain Schiff bases complexes of
manganese. A problem with the known art is that metallo-porphyrin and phthalocyanine
compounds are not readily soluble in aqueous media. Homogeneous catalysis is,
therefore, problematical. Even in systems wherein manganese complexes operate
heterogeneously, there remains room for yield and conversion improvements.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
method for epoxidation of olefins which achieves improved yields and conversion over
known catalytic systems.These and other objects of the present invention will become more readily
apparent from the detailed description and examples given hereafter. A method of epoxidizing olefins is provided which includes the step of
contacting the olefin in the presence of a specific manganese complex,
and
the step of recovering epoxidized olefin. Epoxidation is best conducted in a fluid
medium, especially an aqueous system. Now it has been discovered that certain manganese complexes are highly
effective at epoxidizing olefins. These complexes are formed from at least one
manganese atom coordinated with a nitrogen-containing ligand such that a molar ratio
of manganese to coordinated nitrogen atoms is 1:3, and
are mononuclear and
dinuclear manganese complexes of Formulas (1) and (2), respectively. The structure
of Formula (1) is as follows:
