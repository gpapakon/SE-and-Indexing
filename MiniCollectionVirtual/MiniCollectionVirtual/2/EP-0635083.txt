<DESCRIPTION>
 ASPHALT PRODUCTION PLANTField of the InventionThe present invention relates to an asphalt production plant for producing an asphaltic mix suitable for use in forming or resurfacing a roadway. Background of the InventionConventional batch type plants for producing asphaltic mix typically comprise a drum dryer for heating and drying the stone aggregate, and a vertical bucket elevator for conveying the heated and dried aggregate from the dryer to the top of a tower. The tower includes an enclosed vibrating screen section at the top, for receiving and segregating the aggregate by groups of average particle size. The segregated aggregate then drops through individual chutes to a bin section which underlies the screen section, and which comprises a plurality of separate bins, and so that each bin receives an aggregate of a predetermined average size from the screen section. Four such bins are typically provided, with the initial or "sand" bin having greater capacity than the remaining bins. A. weigh hopper is positioned below the bins, which permits the aggregate from one or more bins to be weighed out to provide a desired mix, as required for example for a roadway base coat or a finish coat. A mixing pugmill is positioned below the weigh hopper for mixing the weighed quantity of aggregate with hot 

liquid asphalt, and the bottom of the pugmill includes a gate opening, such that the contents may be dropped into an underlying truck or other receptacle.When making an asphaltic mix containing recycle asphalt paving (RAP) , cold RAP is conventionally delivered from a feed bin and into the elevator at a controlled feed rate, and so as to be delivered to the screen section concurrently with the heated aggregate. The aggregate is preferably superheated, to a temperature of at least about 400Â°F, to permit it to dry and heat the RAP.As will be apparent, once the decision is made to run RAP in the above described conventional plant, there is a fixed percentage of RAP in each bin, and all batches necessarily contain that percentage until the bins are emptied. Also, the percentage of RAP is limited to not more than about 20 percent, since a higher percentage tends to blind the screens of the screen section with sticky material. In one early batch plant design, a separate bin for the cold RAP is positioned on the ground adjacent the tower, and a conveyor is provided for selectively delivering the cold RAP directly into the weigh hopper or into the pugmill mixer, where it comes into contact with superheated aggregate

<CLAIMS>
THAT WHICH IS CLAIMED IS:
1. An asphalt production plant comprising a rotary drum dryer for heating and drying stone aggregate, elevator means for conveying the heated and dried aggregate from said rotary dryer upwardly to an elevated discharge chute, means for delivering a second material, such as recycled asphalt, into said elevator means so that the second material is also conveyed to said discharge chute, gate means communicating with said discharge chute for selectively directing the material conveyed to said discharge chute either into a first duct or into a second duct, an upright tower positioned adjacent said elevator means, a plurality of aggregate bins mounted in the upper portion of said tower and positioned in a laterally aligned relationship, a recycle bin mounted in the upper portion of said tower so as to be laterally aligned with said aggregate bins and intermediate selected ones of said aggregate bins, and with said first duct communicating with an upper portion of said recycle bin, aggregate screening means mounted to said tower above said aggregate bins for receiving aggregate delivered through said second duct and for separating the aggregate into groups of varying average size and delivering the separated groups into respective ones of said aggregate bins, weigh hopper means mounted in said tower below said aggregate bins and said recycle bin for weighing out a selected amount of the material from each of said aggregate bins and said recycle bin, and mixing means mounted in said tower below said weigh hopper means for selectively receiving material 


__ from said weigh hopper means and mixing the same with a predetermined amount of liquid asphalt, and for delivering the resulting asphalt mix into an underlying receiver.
5 2. The asphalt production plant as defined in Claim 1 further comprising means for delivering aggregate to said drum dryer at a predetermined feed rate by weight, and said means for delivering a second material includes means for delivering the second 10 material at a predetermined feed rate by weight.
3. The asphalt production plant as defined in Claim 1 wherein said first duct extends laterally through at least one of said aggregate bins.
4. An asphalt production plant comprising 15 a rotary drum dryer for heating and drying stone aggregate, elevator means for conveying the heated and dried aggregate from said rotary dryer upwardly to an elevated discharge chute, 20 an upright tower positioned adjacent said elevator means, a plurality of aggregate bins mounted in the upper portion of said tower and positioned in a laterally aligned relationship, 25 a recycle bin mounted in the upper portion of said tower so as to be laterally aligned with said aggregate bins and intermediate selected ones of said aggregate bins, aggregate screening means mounted to said 30 tower above said aggregate bins for receiving aggregate delivered to said discharge chute and for separating the aggregate into groups of varying average size and delivering the separated groups into respective ones of said aggregate bins, 


 eans including a duct which extends laterally through at least one of said aggregate bins and communicates with an upper portion of said recycle bin for delivering a second material, such as recycled asphalt, into said recycle bin without passing through said screening means, weigh hopper means mounted in said tower below said aggregate bins and said recycle bin for weighing out a selected amount of the material from each of said aggregate bins and said recycle bin, and mixing means mounted in said tower below said weigh hopper means for selectively receiving material from said weigh hopper means and mixing the same with a predetermined amount of liquid asphalt, and for delivering the resulting asphalt mix into an underlying receiver.
5. The asphalt production plant as defined in Claim 4 further comprising means for delivering aggregate to said drum dryer at a predetermined feed rate by weight, and said means for delivering a second material includes means for delivering the second material at a predetermined feed rate by weight.
