<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to composite materials made from 
a polyolefin or polyolefins which have been chemically modified and 
reinforcing fibers which are laminated, not extruded, into a 
composite material. Polypropylene is a popular thermoplastic resin because it is 
lightweight, yet stiff, resistant to chemicals and heat, and can 
withstand repeated flexing. Equally important, polypropylene is 
less expensive than many other thermoplastics. As manufacturers 
look to new materials, polypropylene remains a front runner in 
thermoplastic applications. To improve strength, polypropylene has 
been reinforced with glass fibers. In automotive applications, 
polypropylene has been used for fan shrouds and battery cases. 
But, as government mandated fuel economy standards become more 
stringent, auto makers are looking for ways to reduce weight while 
simultaneously increasing the crash worthiness of their vehicles. 
One way companies are meeting the government and consumer mandates 
is by using polypropylene to replace metal and other plastics in 
automotive interiors and exteriors. This strategy has helped 
reduce both weight and cost while actually improving the 
recyclability of the vehicle. Although polypropylene is known for its low cost and light 
weight, it has lagged behind metal and other plastic materials in 
terms of strength. While reinforcement with glass fibers can 
dramatically increase the strength and stiffness of polypropylene, 
its use in certain areas has been limited. Researchers have sought  
 
ways to further improve the properties of reinforced polypropylene. 
Despite glass fibers being an excellent source of reinforcement, a 
major drawback is attributed to the lack of interaction between the 
polar surfaces of the glass fibers with the non-polar 
polypropylene. The result is a very weak filler/polymer interface. 
After analyzing failures in composites of polypropylene and glass, 
it has been determined that the site of the failure is this weak 
interface. To combat this problem manufacturers have treated glass 
fibers, shortly after they are formed, with a composition, often 
called a size, which provides lubricating and protective properties 
to the fibers, and assists in providing strength and other 
properties to the reinforced polymers and the products made 
therefrom. These sizing agents help to hold the glass bundles and 
reduce surface polarity of the glass. One area where reinforced polypropylene has not done as well 
as other plastics is in the area of automotive
