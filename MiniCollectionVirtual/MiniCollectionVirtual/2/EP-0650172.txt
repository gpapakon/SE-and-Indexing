<ABSTRACT>
This is a housing for a toroidal core of the type formed by two shells (16, 16') which, appropriately juxtaposed and secured to one another, jointly, for winding at least one electrical wire (15), form a central passage (19), and several lateral passages (20) parallel to this central passage (19) and at a distance from it. According to the invention, the shells (16, 16') have complementary nesting means on their junction plane (P), the said nesting means including at least one boss (B1, B2) projecting from this junction plane (P) and a recess (E1, E2) hollowed out on it, and the lateral passages (20) are configured to suit these nesting means. Application, particularly, to differential detection devices.

A toroidal core housing of the kind formed by two shell portions (16,
16') which, appropriately disposed facing each other and fixed relative to

each other, jointly form on the one hand an annular volume (18) for housing
a toroidal core (10) and on the other hand for winding at least one

electrical wire a central passage (19) and, parallel to said central
passage (19), at a distance therefrom and at a distance from each other, a

plurality of lateral passages (20), characterised in that, the housing
shell portions (16, 16') having complementary interengagement means at

their joining plane (P), said interengagement means comprise at least one
boss (B1, B2) in projecting relationship with said joining plane (P) and a

recess (El, E2) in hollowed relationship with said joining plane, and the
lateral passages (20) are afforded by virtue of said interengagement means.
A toroidal core housing according to claim 1 characterised in that
the lateral passages (20) are annularly distributed in two zones (Z1, Z2),

namely a zone (Z1) close to the central passage (19) and a zone (Z2) remote
therefrom.
A toroidal core housing according to claim 2 characterised in that
the numbers of lateral passages (2) per zone (Z1, Z2) are different.
A toroidal core housing according to any one of claims 1 to 3
characterised in that the lateral passages (20) extend in the actual

thickness of the wall of the housing shell portions (16, 16').
A toroidal core housing according to claim 2 characterised in
that, for the lateral passages (20) of the zone (Z1) close to the central

passage (19), the same circularly elongate boss (B1) combines at least two
lateral passages (20).
A toroidal core housing according to claim 2 characterised in
that, for the lateral passages (20) of the zone (Z2) remote from the

central passage (19), the same boss (B2) corresponds only to a single
lateral passage (20). 
A toroidal core housing according to any one of claims 1 to 6
characterised in that the complementary interengagement means between the

two housing shell portions (16, 16') extend only over a fraction of the
height thereof.
A toroidal core housing according to any one of claims 1 to 7
characterised in that the edge of the mouth opening to the exterior of the

lateral passages (20) is eased by a rounded portion (28) at each of their
ends.
A toroidal core housing according to any one of claims 1 to 8
characterised in that the housing shell portions (16, 16') each have in

projecting relationship at their back separating fins (29) which radiate in
a star configuration from the central passage (19).
A toroidal core housing according to any one of claims 1 to 9
characterised in that the housing shell portions (16, 16') each have in

projecting relationship at their back at spaced positions along their
periphery separating partitions (31).
A toroidal core housing according to any one of claims 1 to 10
characterised in that latching means (32, 34) are provided between the

housing shell portions (16, 16').
A toroidal core housing according to any one of claims 1 to 11
characterised in that the two housing shell portions (16, 16') are

identical to each other.
A wound toroidal core of the kind comprising at least one winding
(12A, 12B) of electrical wire (14A, 14B) around the toroidal core housing

(11) in which it is housed, characterised in that said toroidal core
housing (11) is in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 12.
A wound toroidal core according to claim 13 characterised in that
the electrical wire (14A, 14B) is a flexible and bare or slightly insulated

electrical wire. 
A wound toroidal core according to claim 14 characterised in that
the electrical wire (14A, 14B) is a braid.
A wound toroidal core according to either one of claims 14 and 15
characterised in that only the lateral passages (20) that the toroidal core

housing (11) forms are utilised for the winding (12A, 12B) of the
electrical wire (14A, 14B).
