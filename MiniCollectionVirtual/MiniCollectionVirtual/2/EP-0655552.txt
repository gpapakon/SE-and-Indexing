<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum response type carburetor (1) is provided 
with a diaphragm device (3) including a diaphragm chamber 

separated into two chambers (A,B) by means of a diaphragm (12) and 
provided with a carburetor body including a venturi passage (5) 

which is communicated with the diaphragm chamber and in 
which a throttle valve (7) is disposed. A pressure change 

within the venturi passage (5) caused by opening and closing 
the throttle valve (7) is transmitted to the diaphragm chamber 

and the diaphragm (12) is thereby moved up and down thereby 
opening and closing a piston valve (6) interlocked with the 

diaphragm (12) and a fuel (21) is then sucked from a float chamber (4). 
The diaphragm (12) is formed of hydrogen impregnated nitrile 

butadiene rubber (NBR). Seal members such as gasket (30) and 
O-rings (31,32,33 etc) disposed in the carburetor (1) to portions 

requiring liquid-proof property are also formed of the hydrogen 
impregnated NBR.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vacuum
response type carburetor
according to the preamble of claim 1.A vacuum response type carburetor which is
mainly used for a motorcycle has a structure in which a
pressure change, within a venturi passage in the
carburetor, caused by opening and closing of a throttle
valve is transmitted to a diaphragm disposed in a diaphragm
chamber device to thereby open or close a piston valve
interlocked with the diaphragm.That is, when a throttle grip of the motorcycle
is operated, a butterfly-type throttle valve provided
within the venturi passage opens or closes, and then, the
pressure within the venturi passage is raised or lowered
thereby. This pressure change is transmitted to the
diaphragm device, and the diaphragm disposed in the
diaphragm chamber and made of a rubber thin film is moved,
so that the piston valve which is interlocked with the
diaphragm is also moved to thereby adjust the passage area
of the venturi passage and the amount of fuel to be
delivered. Consequently, an air-fuel mixture of an optimal
air-fuel ratio according to the degree of opening of the
throttle valve is always provided to the engine side, thus 
maintaining engine properties and fuel consumption to a
desired condition.Since the diaphragm of the carburetor is
perpetually exposed to a mist of gasoline which is the fuel
for the engine, the diaphragm is formed, in the prior art,
of a rubber material having chemical-resistant property,
such as hydrine rubber or NBR (nitrile butadiene rubber).However, qualities of gasolines are different in
various countries, in some case, the quality is lesser than
that in Japan, and accordingly, there is a possibility of
adhering a gasoline of poor quality to the diaphragm and
hence advances the deterioration of the diaphragm.For example, since the hydrine rubber is apt to
swell in use of the gasoline of poor quality, a diaphragm
formed of the hydrine rubber may become soft and
deteriorate, leading to early rupturing. On the other hand,
a diaphragm formed of the NBR may become hard and
deteriorate, thereby obstructing smooth sliding of a piston
valve assembled in a carburetor.A high-octane gasoline and an alcohol fuel have a
tendency to cause the diaphragm to deteriorate as compared
to a regular gasoline.In the above regard, in the prior art, the
diaphragm is formed thicker in order to slow the
deterioration from the gasoline of poor quality, the
high-octane gasoline and the alcohol fuel to prevent early 
rupturing and obstruction of smooth sliding of the piston
