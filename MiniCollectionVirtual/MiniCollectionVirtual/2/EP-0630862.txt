<ABSTRACT>
Biological water treatment process using a biological reactor containing a microorganism culture bound on a granular support material, according to which a consumable powdery material is injected into the said reactor, this process being characterised in that it used so as to ensure an autoselection and an autoregulation of the support material of the particle size needed for the biological process.

<CLAIMS>
Method for the biological treatment of water, using a 
biological reactor containing a microorganisms 

culture fixed on a granular support material for 
biomass, according to which a consumable, powdery 

support material is injected into said reactor, 
characterized in that said powdery material is 

constituted of kaolin waste having a density greater 
than 1500 kg/m
3
 and it is injected into said reactor 
in raw, non-selected form over a wide range of 

granulometry from 0 to 500 µm and preferably from 0 
to 200 µm, with a proportion of less than 5% by 

volume of the biological reactor filled with the 
support material, so as to assure a self-selection 

and a self-regulation of the granulometry of the 
support material. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said consumable powdery material has an available 

surface of the order of 800 to 5000 m
2
/m
3
. 
Method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the injection of said 

consumable powdery material takes place continuously. 
Method according to any one of claims 1 or 2, 

characterized in that the injection of said 
consumable powdery material takes place 

intermittently.
