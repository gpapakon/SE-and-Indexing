<ABSTRACT>
A dot matrix printing head and related printing apparatus (43), the 
print head comprising a plurality of printing electromagnets, each having 

a magnetic core (1,2), an energization winding (3,4), a movable armature 
(15,16) for actuation of a printing element (25,26) and a first abutment 

element (84,39) defining a first rest position of the armatures, where 
electrically energizeable means (21,29,31,32) are provided for 

controlling the position of a second abutment element (22) which defines 
a second rest position of the armatures, so as to change the air gap 

width between each armature and the related magnetic core and the stroke 
of the related printing element, depending on requirement of printing on 

single copy sheets or multiple copy sheets, and where, in addition to gap 
adjustment, the duration of the energization time interval of the 

printing electromagnets, their energization frequency and the advancement 
speed of the print head relative to a printing medium are modified to 

achieve the best performances, both when printing on single copy sheet 
and on multiple copy sheets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dot matrix printing head and a 
printing apparatus using such head. 
It is known that serial impact dot matrix printers are broadly used as 
computer peripherals by reason of their reliability, low cost, 
versatility and high printing speed. When suitably driven by printing control programs they can 
virtually print any kind of fonts, as well as diagrams and drawings, on 
several kind of printing supports, from thin paper sheets to multiple 
copy forms. The achievable printing speed is very high. The same equipment may 
achieve a speed of 600 characters per second when printing in draft mode, 
and a speed of 200 characters per second when printing in near letter 
quality mode. The factor which limits the printing speed is essentially the 
maximum needle operative frequency which, in turn, is determined by the 
time required to energize an electromagnet, driving the needle against 
the printing support, and by the time required for the needle to return 
in a rest position, after it has impacted on the printing medium. Today operative frequencies in the range of 2000-2500 Hz can be 
attained, which however impose some restriction as to the operative 
conditions of the printing device. The shorter is the stroke requested to the needles and the lesser 
is the energy which the needle has to transfer by impact to the printing 
medium, the higher is the operative frequency. A short stroke and a low impact energy impose a limit to the 
thickness of the printing medium and the number of copies which may be 
printed, which may be overcome, partially, by the precise machining of 
the printing apparatus and its set up. The printing apparatuses of today have therefore to set a 
compromise between the operative printing speed and the characteristics 
of the printing medium. If the printer has to print on multiple copy paper, the print head 
must be designed ans set up to this purpose, achieves a maximum operative 
frequency related thereto and even when printing on single sheets the 
maximum operative frequency remains the same. This problem is overcome by the dot matrix printing head of the  
 
present invention which is provided with means for dinamycally changing 
its set up on demand, so as to establish the most suitable operative 
conditions as a function of the characteristics of the printing support. The stroke of the needle, in a print head of today, where the 
needle is driven by an end of an electromagnet armature, acting as a 
lever actuated by electromagnet energization,
