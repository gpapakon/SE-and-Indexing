<ABSTRACT>
A packaged device with a lead frame, a lead frame and an article of 
manufacture comprising a base metal (20), a layer of nickel (21) on the 

base metal (20), and a 
protective composite of metal layers (22) on the nickel. The composite 

(22) includes, in 
succession from the nickel layer, a layer of palladium or soft 

gold strike (23), a layer of 
palladium-nickel alloy (24), a layer of palladium (25) and a 

layer of gold (26). 
The palladium or 

soft gold strike layer (23) acts primarily as a bonding (an adhesive) 
layer between the Ni (21) 

and Pd-Ni alloy layers (24) and as a layer that enhances reduction 
in porosity of 

subsequent layers, Pd-Ni alloy layer (24) acts as a trap for base 
metal ions, Pd layer (25) acts 

as a trap for Ni ions from the Pd-Ni alloy layer (24), and the outer 
gold layer (26) 

synergistically enhances the quality to the Pd layer (25). The various 
layers are in 

thickness sufficient to effectively accomplish each of their designated 
roles, 

depending on the processing and use conditions. Pd of soft Au strike 
layer (23) may be 

1-5 microinches thick, Pd-Ni alloy layer (24) from 4 to 100 
microinches, Pd layer (25) from 1 

to 100 microinches and the outer gold layer (26) from 1 to 100 
microinches in thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns integrated circuit devices in which an integrated
circuit unit and a lead frame are sealed within a protective enclosure.Integrated circuit (IC) devices, having an integrated circuit (IC) unit and
a lead frame which are sealed within a protective enclosure, find wide use in
products including consumer electronics, household appliances, computers,
automobiles, telecommunications, robotics and military equipment. The IC unit
encompasses integrated circuit chips and hybrid integrated circuit modules which
include one or more of the IC chips and other electronic components on a plastic or
ceramic support base.A means to electrically interconnect an IC unit to circuitry external of
the IC device takes the form of a lead frame. The lead frame is formed from a highly
electrically conductive material, such as copper, copper alloy or an iron-nickel alloy,
by stamping or etching a metal blank into a plurality of leads (or lead fingers)
defining a central area in which the IC unit is mounted. The lead frame comprises
typically a mounting paddle and a plurality of separate lead members extending
away from a location adjacent to the paddle. In those instances where the paddle is
absent, the leads are formed so that the IC unit is supported by the ends of the leads
or the ends of the leads are positioned in an abutting or spaced position with the IC
unit or the ends of the leads are overlapping the periphery of the IC unit.The blanked lead frames are, typically, plated in a conventional manner
with a layer of nickel over the surface of the lead frame. Nickel plating was intended
to serve as a barrier to diffusion of copper to and formation of reactive copper
products, such as copper oxides and sulfides, on the surface of the lead frame.
Unfortunately, nickel layer in thickness of less than 400 microinches (10.2
micrometers) contains pores through which migration and diffusion of copper to the
surface of the lead frame takes place. However, a layer having thickness of greater
than 400 microinches tends to crack when the leads are eventually bent.An attempt to eliminate or at least reduce effects of diffusion of copper
through a less than 400 microinches thick nickel layer was made by depositing a thin
layer of palladium or palladium/nickel alloy on top of the nickel layer. (See
European Patent Application No. 0 250 146 published December 23, 1987).
However, copper corrosion products, including oxides, sulfides and other reaction 
products of copper, continued to appear on the lead frame,
