<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to novel compounds
containing a fused multiple ring lactam which are
useful as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.
Some of these compounds also possess neutral
endopeptidase inhibitory activity. This invention is
also directed to pharmaceutical compositions
containing such selective or dual action inhibitors
and the method of using such compositions. This
invention is also directed to the process for
preparing such novel compounds and novel
intermediates.Ruyle U.S. Patent 5,484,294 and Flynn et al. U.S. Patent 4,973,585 and EP
492,369 disclose substituted carboxyalkylamino tricyclic lactams wherein the lactam
include a benzo fused ring as ACE inhibitors.Flynn et al. in EP 481,522 and 534,363 disclose substituted
mercaptoalkanoylamino tricyclic lactams wherein the lactam includes a benzo fused
ring as dual inhibitors.Flynn et al. in EP 534,492 and 534,396 disclose substituted
carboxyalkanoylamino tricyclic lactams wherein the lactam includes a benzo fused ring
as dual inhibitors.The novel fused multiple ring lactam compounds
of this invention include those compounds of the
formula

cycloalkyl-CH2- wherein the cycloalkyl ring is of 5 to 7 carbons, or
straight or branched chain alkyl of 1 to 7 carbons;R6 is lower alkyl of 1 to 4 carbons or phenyl;m is one or two;the term "aryl" refers to phenyl, 1-nahthyl, or 2-naphthyl;the term "substituted aryl" refers to phenyl, 1-naphthyl, or
2-naphthyl having a substituent selected from lower alkyl of 1 to 4
carbons, lower alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbons, lower alkylthio of 1 to 4
carbons, halo, hydroxy, trifluoromethyl, amino, -NH(lower alkyl of 1
to 4 carbons), and -N(lower alkyl of 1 to 4 carbons)2 ; andthe term "heteroaryl" refers to 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl,

branched chain radicals having up to seven carbon
atoms. The term "lower alkyl" refers to straight or
branched radicals having up to four carbon atoms and
is a preferred subgrouping for the term alkyl.The term "halo" refers to chloro, bromo,
fluoro, or iodo.The terms "lower alkoxy" and "lower alkylthio"
refer to such lower alkyl groups as defined above
attached to an oxygen or sulfur.The term
