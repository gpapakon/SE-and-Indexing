<ABSTRACT>
A hydroelastic support (10) has two members which are connected respectively to the engine and propulsion unit (38), and to the vehicle structure, being linked by a block (16) of an elastomer material. The support incorporates a first working chamber (44), delimited by an elastic moving partition whose outer surface is connected by a push rod (54) to a drive (56) which can move the rod and partition to create pressure forces in the working chamber (44). The lower part of the support is equipped with a second working chamber (60) which is linked to a variable-volume chamber (80) between the vehicle structure and an adjacent shock absorber (83) forming part of the vehicle's suspension system.

Hydroelastic support (10) intended to be interposed 
between an engine unit (38) of an automobile and the structure 

(78) of the body of the vehicle, of the type having two 
bracing frames (24, 30) which are connected respectively to 

the engine unit (38) and to the structure of the body (78) 
and which are joined by a mass of elastomeric material (16), 

this support having in its upper part a first working chamber 
(44), filled at least partially with liquid and delimited at 

least in part by the mass of elastomeric material (16, 18, 42) 
and by a movable partition (46) made from elastic material. 

this support (10) also having in its lower part (26) a second 
working chamber (60) which is delimited at least in part by 

the mass of elastomeric material (16, 26, 58) and by an 
elastic membrane (62), characterised in that the external face 

(52) of the movable partition includes a push rod (54) with 
which a device for driving the movable partition co-operates 

in order to apply to this latter displacements which are 
controlled in such a way as to create pressure forces in the 

first working chamber (44) which are synchronous with the 
harmonics of the vibrations of the engine unit, and that the 

elastic membrane has means for connection to a space (80) of 
variable volume provided between the structure of the body of 

the vehicle (78) and an adjacent part (83) of a telescopic 
shock absorber belonging to the suspension of the vehicle, the 

second working chamber (60) and the space (80) being filled 
with liquid. 
Hydroelastic support as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that the mass of elastomeric material (16) is 

rotationally symmetrical about an axis (X-X) corresponding 
substantially to the general direction of stressing of the 

support (10). 
Hydroelastic support as claimed in Claim 2,  
 

characterised in that it includes, provided in succession in 
the general direction of stressing of the support, an upper 

bracing frame (24) connected to the upper end (20) of the mass 
of elastomeric material (16), the mass of elastomeric material 

(16), and a lower bracing frame (30) connected to the lower 
end (28) of the mass of elastomeric material (16). 
Hydroelastic support as claimed in Claim 3, 
characterised in that the upper bracing frame (24) is 

rotationally symmetrical about the axis (X-X) of the mass of 
elestomeric material (16) and is closed on its upper part by 

the movable partition (46). 
Hydroelastic support as claimed in one of Claims 3 or 4, 
characterised in that the lower bracing frame (30) is 

rotationally symmetrical about the axis (X-X) of the mass of 
elastomeric material (16) and is closed on its lower part by 

the elastic membrane (62). 
Hydroelastic support as claimed in any one of Claims 3 
to 5, characterised in that the mass of elastomeric material 

(16) is constituted by an element having the general shape of 
a biconical bobbin. 
Hydroelastic support as claimed in Claim 6, 
characterised in that the internal partition (68) of the 

elastic membrane (62) has an abutment protrusion (70) the 
profile of which is substantially complementary to the profile 

of the internal surface (58) of the lower cone (26) of the 
mass of elastomeric materiel (16). 
Hydroelastic support as claimed in any one of Claims 3 
to 7, characterised in that the upper bracing frame (24) has a 

flange (32) for fixing it to the engine unit (38) of the 
vehicle.  

 
Hydroelastic support as claimed in Claim 8 taken in 
combination with Claim 4, characterised in that the flange is 

constituted by a disc (32) which is provided in the interior 
of the upper bracing frame (24) and is pierced in its centre 

(40) in order to receive the movable partition. 
Device for suspension of the body and of the engine unit 
(38) in an automobile, of the type in which a wheel is 

associated with a telescopic shock absorber (82, 83) connected 
on the one hand to the structure of the body (78) by an 

elastic fixing and on the other hand to the wheel by a 
suspension mechanism, the engine unit (38) itself being 

supported elastically by the structure of the body (78) and of 
the type in which a first space (80) of variable volume is 

disposed between the body and the adjacent part of the shock 
absorber (82, 83), the engine unit (38) resting on the 

structure of the body through the intermediary of at least a 
second space (60) of variable volume connected to the first by 

a connecting conduit (79), these two spaces (60, 80) and the 
connecting conduit (79) being filled with an incompressible 

fluid, characterised in that the said second space of variable 
volume is formed by the second working chamber of a 

hydroelastic support (10) constructed in accordance with any 
of the preceding claims which is interposed between the engine 

unit and the structure of the body of the vehicle.
