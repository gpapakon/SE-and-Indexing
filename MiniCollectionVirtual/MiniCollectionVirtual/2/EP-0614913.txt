<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polypeptides 
having excellent medicinal effects, a process for 
preparing the same, a pharmaceutical composition 
containing the same as well as the use thereof. More particularly, the invention relates to polypeptides 
of the following general formula (I): 
wherein R¹ and R² can be the same or different and 
each represents a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl or 
lower alkenyl group; A represents a D-amino acid, Gly 
or Sar, provided that when the D-amino acid is D-Cys, 
it is bonded with L-Cys or D-Cys located in position 5 
through a S-S bond to effect intramolecular ring 
closure; B represents L-Phe or D-Phe in which the 
benzene ring may be substituted or an α-N-alkyl 
derivative thereof; C represents an L-amino acid, 
D-Cys or an α-N-alkyl derivative thereof, with the 
proviso that when A is D-Cys, C is L-Cys or D-Cys and  
 
is bonded with A through a S-S bond as described 
above; D and E each represent an L- or D-basic amino 
acid or an α-N-alkyl derivative thereof; F represents 
a group of the formula: -OR³ (in which R³ is H or a 
lower alkyl group) a group of the formula: 
(in which R⁴ and R⁵ are the same or different and each 
represents H or a lower alkyl group), a group of the 
formula: -G-OR⁶ (in which G is an L- or D-amino acid 
or Gly or an α-N-alkyl derivative thereof and R⁶ 
represents H or a lower alkyl group), a group of the 
formula: 
(in which G is the same as defined above 
and R⁷ and R⁸ may be the same or different and each 
represents H or a lower alkyl group), a group of the 
formula: -G-(L-Arg)-OR⁹ or -G-(D-Arg)-OR⁹ (in which G 
is the same as defined above and R⁹ represents H or a 
lower alkyl), a group of the formula: 
(in which G is the same as defined above and R¹⁰ and 
R¹¹ can be the same or different and each represents H 
or a lower alkyl group), a group of the formula: 
-G-J-OR¹² in which G is the same as defined as above, 
J is a neutral amino acid group or an acidic amino 
acid group and R¹² is hydrogen or a lower alkyl group; 
or a group of the formula: -G-Arg-M-OR¹³ in which M is 
a D-amino acid group and R¹³ is hydrogen or a lower 
alkyl group, provided that all of the amino acids  
 
constituting any one given polypeptide of the above 
formula do not simultaneously represent an L-amino 
acid of the general formula: 
(in which R represents a group corresponding to a 
structural formula of an amino acid deprived of a 
group of the formula: 
that is, at least one 
of the amino acids of a given polypeptide must be a 
D-amino acid or an
