<ABSTRACT>
Methods are disclosed for determining an analyte in a medium suspected of containing the analyte. One method comprises providing (1) combining a medium suspected of containing the analyte and a novel chemiluminescent compound, (2) combining a means for chemically activating the chemiluminescent compound; and (3) detecting the amount of luminescence generated by the chemiluminescent compound. The amount of luminescence generated is related to the amount of analyte in the medium. The chemiluminescent compound can be chemically activated by hydrogen peroxide. Compositions and kits are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NOVEL CHEMILUMINESCENT COMPOUNDS AND METHODS OF USEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThis invention relates to compositions, methods and kits for determining an analyte in a sample. Chemiluminescent labels for immunoassays and nucleic acid probe assays provide a high degree of sensitivity when compared to other commonly used labels. An excellent overview of the subject is discussed in McCapra, et al . , Journal of Bioluminescence and Chemiluminescence 4:51-58 (1989). Particularly important chemiluminescent compounds are acridinium esters and amides, which must be stored in water at a pH that is compatible with protein stability require-ments. This results in the formation of a pseudobase, which is not chemiluminescent. Chemiluminescence is initiated by adding acid to form the acridinium salt, followed by the addition of strongly alkaline hydrogen peroxide. In general, these conditions are not ideal for immunoassays as they are not suitable for preserving receptor- ligand binding and are undesirably complex.The clinical diagnostic field has seen a broad expansion in recent years, both as to the variety of materials (analytes) that may be readily and accurately determined, as well as the methods for the determination. Convenient, reliable and non-hazardous means for detecting the presence of low concentrations of materials in liquids is desired. In clinical chemistry these materials may be present in body fluids in concentrations below 10"12 molar. The difficulty of detecting low concentrations of these materials is increased by the relatively small sample sizes that can be utilized.In developing an assay there are many considerations. One consideration is the signal response to changes in the concentration of analyte. A second consideration is the ease with which the protocol for the assay may be carried out. A third consideration is the variation in interference from sample to sample. Ease of preparation and purification of the reagents, availability of equipment, ease of automation and interaction with material of interest are some of the additional considerations in developing a useful assay.One broad category of techniques involves the use of a receptor which can specifically bind to a particular spacial and polar organization of a labeled ligand as a function of the presence of the analyte. The observed effect of binding by the receptor will depend upon the label. In some instances the binding of the receptor merely provides for a differentiation in molecular weight between bound
