<CLAIMS>
Circuit arrangement comprising at least two carrier 
plates (2, 2′) upon which respectively at least one 

chip-shaped component (6, 6′) to be cooled, in 
particular a semi-conductor component, and contact 

surfaces, are provided, each component with associated 
contact surfaces being electrically conductively 

connected by means of connecting elements, cooling 
elements (1, 1′) upon which the carrier plates (2, 2′) 

are arranged, and associated bridging elements (4, 4′),
characterized in that
 
at least two cooling elements (1 and 1′) with carrier 

plates (2, 2′) and bridging elements (4, 4′) are 
arranged in mirrored form and above one another and 

releasably connected with each other by means of 
mechanical clamping elements, wherein electrically 

required connections to the carrier plates (2, 2′) are 
produced by means of springs (8, 8′) and/or printed 

circuit boards (3, 3′) and the entire circuit 
arrangement is non-destructively separable when mounting 

elements are to be exchanged. 
Circuit arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 at least one cushion element (7) is inserted 
true to form as a pressure storage between the bridging 

elements (4 and 4′).  
 
Circuit arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 the at least one lower and the at least one 
upper cooling elements (1, 1′) have openings for 

mechanical clamping elements (9) for exact-fit 
adjustment and pressure contact. 
Circuit arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 the mechanical clamping elements (9) are screw 
bolts. 
Circuit arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized 

in that
 connecting elements (3, 3′) for contacting the 
carrier plates (2, 2′) are formed as printed circuit 

boards and secured and contacted by means of the 
mechanical clamping elements (9). 
Circuit arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, 

characterized in that
 springs (8, 8′) are used as 
connecting elements for the electrical contacting of 

contact points of the lower carrier plate (2) with the 
upper carrier plate (2′) and/or printed circuit board (3 

or 3′) and, for their adjustment, openings are provided 
in the bridging elements (4, 4′) and/or cushion elements 

(7). 
Circuit arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 at least one bridging element (4 or 4′) has 
metallized conductor strips (5, 5′) for electrically 

contacting the carrier plate (2, 2′) and/or the printed 
circuit board (3, 3′) and contacts these by means of 

pressure.
