<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a biological procedure,
which involves the use of anaerobic bacteria, for
measuring the toxicity caused by polluting substances
in water or water effluents. Bacteria are known as
being efficient detectors of chemical toxicity as they
quickly react to changes in their environment. It is
for this reason that many biological tests have been
developed for monitoring and controlling toxic substances
in water or effluents. In these tests the
inhibition of the metabolism of a species of bacteria
in the presence of toxic substances is compared with
the metabolism of the same species cultivated on a
standard substrate.Different bacterial species are used and various
parameters are measured (with respect to this see
Toxicity Testing Using Microorganisms vol 1 and 2, B.J.
Dutka and G. Bitton publishers, CRC Press 1989).As an example, the bioluminescence of some microorganisms,
the motility inversion of Spirillum volutans, 
the measurement of oxygen consumed and ATP produced,
etc., can be mentioned.Tests which use single bacterial species are more
sensitive, with the same toxicity of molecule, than
those which involve mixed flora, operating in a metabolic
chain, such as for example aerobic and anaerobic
mud.This greater sensitivity is made evident by a lesser
concentration of a certain toxic substance required for
reducing by 50% the standard measurement of the biochemical-biological
parameter which is a specific
tracer of the method (EC 50, from "effective concentration
involving 50% reduction).Tests carried out with mixed flora distinguished by
subsequent metabolic stages can evaluate the toxicity
of a substance on different levels. Normally, owing to
the syntrophy ratio among microbic populations, the EC
50 of a toxic substance is determined on the final
metabolite (for example on methane in the case of
anaerobic bacterial aggregates). The production of
methane is in fact, in any case reduced, either directly
or indirectly by the inhibition of the precursors,
by the presence of toxic substances.Methods which use microbic aggregates, although having
lesser sensitivity in an absolute sense, are particularly
versatile for testing the total toxicity such as
that produced by several compounds contemporaneously 
present as is observed for example in industrial waste.
Tests using a methanogen bacterial biomass were mainly
used for the prevention of biodegradability of effluents
or mud containing toxic substances. Subsequently
tests were developed which were specifically designed
for the
