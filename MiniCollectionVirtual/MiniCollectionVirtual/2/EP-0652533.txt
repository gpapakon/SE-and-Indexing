<ABSTRACT>
A printing apparatus has, in addition to a normal command interpreter (66), a real-time 
command interpreter (64) for simultaneously analyzing control commands as data is received 

from a host device. This real-time command interpreter functions even when the printing 
apparatus is off-line, thereby enabling the status of the printing apparatus to be known even 

when the printing apparatus is not operating. Thus, the host device can be notified of the 
cause for non-operation thereby achieving a high throughput rate printing. The user can cancel 

a cut-sheet paper insertion wait-state at any time. Why an error occurred can be determined in 
an off-line st
ate to enable recovery from the error.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printing apparatus for printing according to commands
received from a host computer, and relates particularly to a printing apparatus suitable for data
processing apparatuses, such as point-of-sale (POS) terminals and electronic cash registers
(ECR), used in processing monetary transactions.When it is inappropriate to continue a current printing operation, since, for instance, the paper
supply is depleted, the printer cover has been opened, or an error has occurred, conventional
printing apparatuses typically stop the printer mechanism containing the print head, and bring
the interface to the host computer off-line (a logical non-connection state) to both protect the
printing apparatus and the communications data, and assure user safety. Once this off-line
state has been entered, however, internal control of the printer apparatus stops, and the data
already transferred to the printer apparatus is no longer processed. Data is also no longer
received by the printer apparatus, and the printer apparatus cannot receive or process any data
output thereto or respond to inquiries from the host computer.The printing apparatus even moves off-line when the form-feed switch is pressed and paper is
being advanced, and when the data receive buffer storing the received data is full (a buffer full
state), and it is difficult to distinguish between these off-line states and off-line states in which
it is inappropriate to continue printing.When the printing apparatus goes off-line, the host computer is no longer able to send the print
data, and the complete system, POS, ECR, or other, comes to a stop. In such a case, the host
computer typically displays a message such as "printer problem, please check" on a display
device, and the user must manually inspect the printing apparatus and correct the problem
leading to the off-line state. However, for many general POS and ECR users, determining the
problem is often difficult and time-consuming.On the other hand, control commands stored in the data receive buffer are interpreted in a
first-in-first-out (FIFO, the first commands stored are the first interpreted) order, and the
appropriate command process is executed. Control commands that have been processed are
deleted from the data receive buffer. As a result, as control commands are successively input
from the host computer, the commands are stored one after the other to the data receive
buffer, and processed in order from the oldest control command stored. This creates a time lag
between
