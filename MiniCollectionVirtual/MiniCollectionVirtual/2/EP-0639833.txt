<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the cleaning of hard 
surfaces, especially glossy surfaces. Compositions for the cleaning of hard surfaces are 
extensively discussed in the art. It is desirable that 
such compositions should have, in particular, the ability 
to provide a good shine to the cleaned surfaces. However, 
surface shine is often compromised by residues of the 
compositions which are left on said surfaces and which 
appear as streaks as water evaporation is completed. This streaking phenomenon caused by a composition's 
residuality tends to be more of a problem as said 
composition is formulated as a concentrate, i.e it 
comprises more actives and less water.  Also, for a given composition, the residuality of said 
composition is even more noticeable as said composition is 
used to clean surfaces made of glossy materials, such as 
glossy ceramic tiles, windows and mirrors, or such 
materials as polyurethane-coated PVC which is widely used 
in Northern America. Also, many products of today are formulated or can be 
used as no-rinse products. This residuality problem tends 
to be more acute for such products or in such conditions, 
as the rinsing step performed for other products cannot 
participate here to decreasing the residuality. It is thus an object of the present invention to 
provide improved shine to hard surfaces, in a manner which 
is applicable to a variety of cleaning compositions, and a 
variety of surfaces. Various solutions have been proposed in the art to 
meet this object, including the use of certain solvents, or 
the formulation of specific ingredient combinations. It has now been found that this object could be met by 
formulating a composition which comprises an anionic 
surfactant system and an effective amount of magnesium ions 
as counterions for said anionic surfactants. In other 
words, for any given cleaning composition comprising an 
anionic surfactant system, which causes residues to appear 
on cleaned surfaces, adding an appropriate amount of 
magnesium ions will cause said residues to appear less, or 
even not to appear anymore. Cleaning compositions comprising magnesium ions have 
been extensively described in the art, mainly in the 
context of dish washing, for instance in WO-A-9 206 171, 
WO-A-9 206 156, US-A-4 129 515, GB-A-2 078 246, EP-A-0 107 
946, EP-A-0 062 371, FR-A-2 324 723 and FR-A-2 296 688, but  
 
the benefits derivable therefrom in terms of low 
residuality have never been acknowledged. The present invention encompasses the use, in a 
composition
