<ABSTRACT>
A weather strip (71A) for attachment to a flange (44) of a body panel of a 
motor vehicle includes a U-shaped trim portion (72) in which a metal core (75) is 

embedded and a sealing portion (74) formed on an outer surface of the trim portion (72). 
The trim portion (72) has flange gripping portions (73) which project inwardly from 

opposed side walls for gripping the flange (44) on both sides thereof. The weather strip 

(71A) is attached to the flange (44) by caulking the side walls of the trim portion (72) with 
the flange (44) inserted between the flange griping portions (73). One flange gripping 

portion to be located outside the flange (44) in the attached state thereto is composed of a 
sponge layer which covers the inner surface of the trim portion (72) and is to come into 

pressurized contact with an opposed flange surface of the body panel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The priority applications, Japanese 
Patent Application Nos. Hei 5-308680, filed in 
Japan on November 15, 1993; Hei 5-293885 filed in 
Japan on October 28, 1993; and Hei 5-293987 filed 
in Japan on October 29, 1993 are hereby 
incorporated into the present specification by 
this reference. The present invention relates to weather 
strips for motor vehicles, and, more particularly, 
to weather strips for attachment to flanges formed 
along edges of vehicle body panels. In motor vehicles including sun roofs, 
for example, in order to seal between an end edge 
of a roof panel defining a roof opening and a 
peripheral edge of a sun roof panel which opens 
and closes the roof opening, a weather strip is 
attached to the peripheral edge of the sun roof 
panel. FIG. 14 illustrates one example of a 
conventional weather strip for use in a sun roof. 
Along a peripheral edge of a sun roof panel which 
opens and closes a roof opening of a roof panel 
11, a flange 44 is formed. The flange 44 is 
composed of an outer panel 42 and an inner panel 
43 which are bent downwardly and joined together 
by spot-welding at intervals. A weather strip 61 has a trim portion 62 
of a U-shaped cross-section, within which a metal 
core 65 is embedded, and a tubular sealing portion  
 
64 arranged for abutment on an end edge of the 
roof panel 11. Flange gripping lips 63 project 
inwardly from opposed inner surfaces of the trim 
portion 62. When the weather strip 61 is attached to 
the flange 44, the trim portion 62 is pushed onto 
the flange 44 in the state that the flange 44 is 
inserted between the opposed flange gripping lips 
63. Or, the weather strip is formed by extrusion 
into the configuration that the side walls of the 
trim portion are spread apart and a mouth thereof 
is enlarged as compared with the final 
configuration in the attached state to the flange 
44. Further, after the flange 44 is inserted into 
the trim portion 62, the trim portion 62 is 
caulked to narrow the mouth of the trim portion 
62. Thus, the flange gripping lips 63 securely 
grip the flange 44 (USP 4,902,549). In the spot-welded flange 44, depressions 
exist at the spot-welded places. Accordingly, the 
flange gripping lips 63 do not come into close 
contact with the flange 44 at these spot-welded 
places. Between ends of the gripping lips 63 and 
the depressions 45, gaps are generated so that 
rain water or car washing water is likely to pass 
through these gaps and enter the trim portion 62, 
and further intrude into a vehicle compartment. A
