<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a velocimeter and
a position information detection apparatus and, more
particularly, to a velocimeter and a position
information detection apparatus which can be suitably
applied to a Doppler velocimeter for accurately
measuring the moving velocity and the moving distance
of a moving object or fluid in a non-contact manner.As is well known, a Doppler velocimeter is an
apparatus for measuring the moving velocity and the
moving distance of a moving object or fluid by
utilizing the fact that a light beam is modulated by
diffraction or interference generated upon radiation of
a laser beam onto a moving object or fluid.Fig. 1A shows an example of diffraction which
occurs when a laser beam I from a laser diode 1 is
incident on a transmission type diffraction grating 10
in an alignment direction t of grating lines with a
grating line pitch dg. If m represents the order (1,
2,...) of diffraction, and λ represents the wavelength
of light, a diffraction angle 0 is given by:
sin0 = mλ/dgThe diffraction angle of ±n-th order light
components (n = 1, 2,...) other than 0-th order light
is given by:
sin0 = ±n λ/dgFig. 1B is a view showing a state wherein ±n-th
order diffracted light components 5a and 5b transmitted
through the diffraction grating 10 are reflected by
mirrors 6a and 6b to have an incident angle 0 on an
object 7 to be measured as a moving object. A Doppler
frequency F detected by a photodetector 9 which
receives divergent light from the object 7 to be
measured, which is moving at a velocity V is given by:
F = 2V sin0/λ = 2n V/dg
Thus, the frequency F does not depend on the wavelength
λ of the laser beam I, is inversely proportional to the
grating line pitch dg of the diffraction grating 10,
and is proportional to the velocity V of the object 7
to be measured. Since the grating line pitch dg is
sufficiently stable, the Doppler frequency F is a
frequency which is proportional to only the velocity V
of the object 7 to be measured.In Fig. 1B, a lens 8 focuses light reflected by
the object 7 to be measured on the photodetector 9, and
a velocimeter body 61 holds the above-mentioned
constituting members. The mirrors 6a and 6b are
separated by a distance L, and the diffraction grating
10 and the object 7 to be measured are separated by a 
measurement distance h. The diffraction grating 10 may
be replaced by a reflection type diffraction grating.A conventional laser Doppler velocimeter shown in
Fig. 1C includes an optical system, which radiates a
laser beam onto the object 7
