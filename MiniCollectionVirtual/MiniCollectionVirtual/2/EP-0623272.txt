<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for planning a
cellular radio network having a traffic control process,
system control parameters, and a radio environment, comprising creating
a model representing the cellular network and its radio
environment on a digital map.Cellular radio network planning can be divided into
coverage, frequency, capacity, parameter and
transmission planning. Planning applications based on
digital maps have recently been developed for coverage,
frequency and capacity planning. Such planning
applications enable the modelling of the radio
environment of the cellular radio network as a function
of location. One example of such planning applications
is the Network Planning System NSP/X of Nokia. The
operation of the software is based on a mathematic
propagation model for calculating the coverages of base
stations located on a digital map.Another example of conventional network planning
tools is disclosed in WO90/10342 wherein radio channels
are allocated to the cells by utilizing an exclusion
matrix presenting the interaction between the cells in
the system. The allocation of radio channels is
iteratively changed until it is optimal from the point
of view of interference.One subarea of radio network planning, i.e. the
definition of network parameters has conventionally been
carried out manually by applying the method of "trial
and error". Such network parameters include hand-over
parameters, subscriber station and base station power
control parameters and frequency hopping parameters.
Parameter planning starts by defining a so-called
"intelligent guess" for proper parameter values, which
are then applied as such to the base stations of a
planned and established cellular network. Information
is then collected on the operation of the real radio 
network and analysed, and required changes in the
network parameters are made on the basis of the
analysis, which usually means a new "intelligent guess".
A problem with the operational analysis of radio
networks is the acquisition of requisite feedback
information. The most important sources of feedback
information have usually been the statistics of the
mobile switching centre and the feedback from the
network users. Within the most critical areas of the
network, it is also possible to perform actual field
strength measurements, on the basis of which one
attempts to define proper parameter values. However,
this process is extremely slow and laborious, and the
network performance to be obtained by it is only
satisfactory.Careful parameter
