<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method of destroying selected tumor cells comprising administering to a warm-blooded animal a vector construct which directs the expression of at least one immunogenic, non-tumorigenic form of an altered cellular component normally associated with the selected tumor cells. Also provided are vector constructs which direct the expression of altered cellular components. Representative altered cellular components include ras*, p53*, Rb*, alter protein encoded by the Wilms' tumor gene, ubiquitin*, DCC, APC, MCC, neu, an altered receptor, and bcr/abl. Also provided are recombinant viruses carrying a vector construct, target cells infected with the recombinant virus and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the recombinant virus and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of anti-cancer 
immunotherapy, and more specifically, to methods of killing selected tumor cells 
by generating an immune response against the tumor cells. Cancer accounts for one-fifth of the total mortality in the United 
States, and is the second leading cause of death. Cancer is typically characterized 
by the uncontrolled division of a population of cells. This uncontrolled 
division typically leads to the formation of a tumor, which may subsequently 
metastasize to other sites. Primary solid tumors can generally be treated adequately by 
surgical resection. However, the majority of patients which present with solid 
tumors also possess micrometastases beyond the primary tumor site. If treated 
with surgery alone, approximately 70% of these patients will experience recurrence 
of the cancer. In addition to surgery, many cancers are now also treated 
with a combination of therapies involving cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs 
(e.g., vincristine, vinblastine, cisplatin, etc.) and/or radiation therapy. One 
difficulty with this approach, however, is that radiotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic 
agents are toxic to normal tissues, and often create life-threatening side 
effects. In addition, these approaches often have extremely high 
failure/remission rates (up to 90% depending upon the type of cancer). In addition to chemo- and radiation therapies, many have 
attempted to bolster or augment an individual's own immune system in order to 
eliminate the cancer cells. Several immunotherapies have utilized bacterial or 
viral components in order to stimulate the immune system to destroy the tumor 
cells. Examples of such components include immunomodulatory agents (such as 
BCG, endotoxin, and mixed bacterial vaccines), interferons (α, β, and γ), interferon 
inducers (e.g., Brucella abortus, and various viruses), and thymic factors 
(e.g., thymosin fraction 5, and thymosin alpha-1) (see generally "Principles of 
Cancer Biotherapy," Oldham (ed.), Raven Press, New York, 1987). Such agents  
 
have generally been useful as adjuvants and as nonspecific stimulants in animal 
tumor models, but have not yet proved generally effective in humans. Lymphokines have also been utilized in the treatment of cancer. 
Briefly, lymphokines are secreted by a variety of cells, and generally have an 
effect on specific cells in the generation of an immune response. Examples of 
lymphokines include Interleukins (IL)-1, -2, -3, and -4, as well as colony stimulating 
factors such
