<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a wheel suspension arrangement for a vehicle wheel (1) which is supported by a wheel carrier (4) which is guided in vertically movable fashion relative to a vehicle frame by guiding means and spring means and has an additional degree of freedom. The wheel suspension arrangement allows the wheel carrier (4) to execute a pivoting movement in a transverse plane of the vehicle around a rotational axis (16) running in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle. The wheel-control components are arranged in front of and behind the wheel (1) and the driving torque is transmitted via a torque-transmission device (18) arranged within the wheel carrier (4).
