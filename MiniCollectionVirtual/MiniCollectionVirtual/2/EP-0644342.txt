<ABSTRACT>
A linear motion guide characterized in that a track (11) is provided with two raceway grooves (11a) in an 
upper surface thereof, and one or two raceway grooves (11b) in side surfaces thereof, a slider (12) being provided in 

the portions of its recess (12c) which are opposed to the raceway grooves (11a, 11b) in the track (11) with raceway 
grooves (12a, 12b), the depth of each of the raceway grooves being substantially close to a half of the diameter of 

a ball rolling therein, a distance between the two raceway grooves (11a) formed in the upper surface of the track 
(11) and that between these raceway grooves (11a and 11b) formed in the side surfaces of the track being changed 

variously with respect to the distance between the corresponding raceway grooves (12a, 12b) in the slider (12). This 
enables the production of a linear motion guide apparatus having an optimum contact angle by setting the distances 

between the raceway grooves in the track (11) and slider (12) in accordance with load conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a linear movement 
guide apparatus, which is used to be applied to linear guide 
portions of, for instance, machine tools or robots for use in 
industrial purpose. In such machine tools or robots, all kinds of load, 
i.e. load from a radial direction, load from a horizontal 
direction, load from a reversed-radial direction, and a moment 
load, are applied to the linear guide portion thereof, since 
the linear guide portion of the tools or robots is 
diversified. The present invention, particularly, relates to 
a linear movement guide apparatus and a method for assembling 
the apparatus, in which a common member is used to manufacture 
a tracking base and a sliding base of the apparatus without 
regard to the amount or the direction of load applied thereto, 
and suitable contact angles according to the directions, to 
which the loads are applied, can be obtained to give a maximum 
life time, a maximum stiffness and a maximum allowance of load 
to the apparatus.  Such kind of linear movement guide apparatus is, for 
instance, disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Preliminarily 
Publication No. Hei 3-199710. Fig. 23 is a schematic view showing an apparatus of 
the first prior art. As shown in Fig. 23, the linear movement guide 
apparatus 30 comprises a tracking base 31 having a square-shape 
cross-section, a sliding base 32 having a concave 
portion 32, which also has a square-shaped cross section, for 
accepting said tracking base 31, and four rows of indefinitely 
circulating balls 33. On an upper surface of the tracking 
base 31 are provided two rows of ball rolling grooves 31a, and 
on each side surface of the tracking base 31 is arranged one 
row of ball rolling groove 31b, respectively. On an inside 
surface of said concave portion 32c of said sliding base 32, 
are provided two rows of corresponding ball rolling grooves 
32a so as to face to said two rows of ball rolling grooves 31a 
formed on the upper surface of the tracking base 31, and one 
row of corresponding ball rolling groove 32b formed on each 
side surface thereof so as to face to the row of ball rolling 
groove 31b formed on the upper surface of the tracking base 
31, respectively. The ball rolling grooves 31a and 32a, which 
face to each other, are arranged as circular-ark shaped 
shallow grooves having a slightly larger dimension than that  
 
of the balls to be held therein. It should be noted that the 
ball rolling grooves 31a and 31b, which also face to each 
other, are arranged as Gothic ark-shaped
