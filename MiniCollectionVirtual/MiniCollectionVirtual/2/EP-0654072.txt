<ABSTRACT>
An original method for utilization of solid fuels of low calorific value in the production of electrical energy is described which leads to 3 times higher yields than these obtained today by burning in an operation working with efficient complete internal pollution control. The method covers solid fuels of low calorific values 800 to 3.000 Kcal/Kg which pyrolyse by 30 % to 80 % at temperatures under 600  DEG C which are utilized in an operation consisting of two pressure reactors in series the first of fluidized bed type where the pyrolysis is perfomed at 450-600  DEG C which is a reductive process forming hydrogen sulfide and a second pressure reactor of solid bed type where the carbon residue of pyrolysis is directed to be gasified with oxygen or with oxygen-steam where the sulfur is oxidized to sulfur dioxide. The two gas steams are mixed under conditions to neutralize the contained sulfur gases by a Claus reaction: 2H2S + SO2 -
>
 3S + 2H2O. The fuel gases are produced at temperatures of 600-800  DEG C and at pressures of 20 to 30 atm and are utilized in an external turbine to produce electricity from the thermomechanical energy contained or are exchanged to produce pressure steam. Then the fuel gases are used in a combined circle arrangement to produce electric energy by utilizing their thermal values.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention describes an original gasification method of low
caloric value solid fuels e.g. lignites and peats with
pyrolysis and oxygen or oxygen-steam gasification in two
stages. Additionally it describes an original process by which
the gases produced are utilised in a Combined-cycle advanced
system for producing high amounts of electric energy in an
operation running without environmental pollution.With the existing crisis in securing adequate amounts of
energy and since petroleum supplies are not regular in
availability and price, the national programs for producing
electric energy rather prefer to develop local energy sources.
In these preferred developments, coal is the main source to
consider, which is the first fuel to be used in power
production and is more abundant and more regularly distributed
in the world than oil. The resources in coal are divided in
low and high thermal value. They are also divided according to
their sulfur content which by burning the solid fuels becomes
sulfur dioxide creating toxic environmental pollution. With
that problem, the utilization of solid fuels is restricted to
those containing low sulfur and create as low as possible
environmental damage.In relation to coal and to its utilization in the production
of electric energy it is observed that by its burning the
result in electric energy is low, it releases high amounts of
sulfur dioxide, fly ash and nitric oxides and it creates high
corrosion in the equipment.Additionally, by burning solid fuels high amount of carbon
dioxide are produced which today is considered a major
pollution factor, being the main source for the green-house
conditions emerging in our planet. And all these environmental
and production problems appear more critical by the use of
solid fuel of low caloric values as lignites and peats.To face these problems today there exist solutions leading to
the reduction of the sulfur content in those low calorific
fuels and to the neutralization of the combustion gases. Those
solutions, however, are costly and the corrections offered,
because of cost, do not make them attractive. A better 
approach appears to be the gasification of low calorific
fuels as an action attractive today in spite of its leading to
high losses of energy. With total gasification the gases can
be washed to separate them from the toxic gases and the flying
ash but with total gasification the thermal value is further
reduced to 65-70% and expensive industrial installations are
needed in the operation.In the meantime, however, with
