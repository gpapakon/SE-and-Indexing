<ABSTRACT>
A process for continuously preparing dialkyl esters of vinyl-phosphonic acid using catalysts at temperatures from 150 to 270 DEG C by cleavage of dialkyl esters of acetoxyethane phosphonic acid at a pressure from 5 to 500 mbar in contact with a liquid catalytic medium with removal of the resulting dialkyl esters of vinylphosphonic acid and other volatile reaction products as vapours, by passing the liquid medium in forced circulation over an evaporator, fresh dialkyl esters of acetoxyethane phosphonic acid, if appropriate mixed with catalyst, being added corresponding to the removal by distillation of dialkyl esters of vinylphosphonic acid and other volatile compounds and, to maintain constant conditions, non-volatile material formed as a by-product being removed from the liquid circulation.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the continuous preparation of dialkyl
vinylphosphonates using catalysts at temperatures of

from 150 to 270Â°C by dissociation of dialkyl acetoxyethanephosphonates
at a pressure of from 5 to

500 mbar in contact with a liquid, catalytically
active medium while drawing off the dialkyl vinyl-phosphonates

formed and other volatile reaction
products as vapors, which comprises conveying the

liquid medium in forced circulation via an evaporator
while feeding in fresh dialkyl acetoxyethanephosphonate,

if desired admixed with catalyst,
corresponding to the distillation of dialkyl vinylphosphonates

and other volatile compounds, and drawing
off non-volatile material formed as byproduct

from the liquid circuit to maintain constant conditions.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
reaction system described, via which the liquid

mixture is conveyed in forced circulation, comprises
a combination of a stirred reactor with a thin-film

evaporator or downdraft evaporator.
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
dissociation products obtained in the form of vapor

are, together with vaporizing, unreacted dialkyl
acetoxyethanephosphonate, introduced into a distillation

column without additional heating, at the top
of which the major part of dialkyl vinylphosphonates 

formed, acetic acid formed and other readily volatile
components is taken off and the major part of

dialkyl acetoxyethanephosphonates also vaporized is
recirculated from the bottom end of the column into

the dissociation circuit.
The process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the column described in claim 3 contains an

additional stripper section having liquid-phase
heating in which continuing separation of the

dialkyl vinylphosphonate formed occurs, so that the
resulting return flow from the bottom of this column

into the reaction system contains only small remaining
amounts of dialkyl vinylphosphonate.
The process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4,
wherein the vapors from the thin-film evaporator and

stirred reactor are taken off in countercurrent to
the circulation of catalyst at the upper end of the

thin-film evaporator.
The process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5,
wherein the vapors formed are separately drawn off

both from the thin-film evaporator and from the

stirred reactor.
The process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the
vapors separately drawn off are recombined before

further workup by distillation.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 7, wherein the catalytically active media used

are acid or basic, in particular acid, preferably a
product which has been formed in the reaction as

relatively high-boiling byproduct and has then been
treated hot with water.
