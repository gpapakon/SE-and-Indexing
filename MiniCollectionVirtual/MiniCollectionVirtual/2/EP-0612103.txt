The present invention discloses a method for making 
a semiconductor device of silicon-on-insulator structure 

comprises the steps of: forming a pad oxide on a wafer 
including a lower silicon substrate, a buried oxide 

layer and an upper silicon layer, and forming an 
oxynitride region on a predetermined portion of the 

buried oxide layer; forming an active silicon layer to 
intersect the oxynitride region, and forming a cavity by 

wet-etching the exposed oxynitride region; forming a 
gate insulating layer on the surface of the exposed 

active silicon layer; forming a polysilicon to fill the 
cavity surrounding said active silicon layer and 

removing a predetermined portion of the doped 
polysilicon to form a gate electrode; and forming source 

and drain regions on the active silicon layer separated 
by the gate electrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
making a semiconductor device in a silicon semiconductor
well surrounded by an insulating layer by means of
silicon-on-insulator techniques.There produce active parasitic devices such as
parasitic metal oxide semiconductor transistors or
parasitic bipolar transistors in a PN junction
separation structure that appears in a complementary
metal oxide semiconductor structure. In addition, there
are problems of deterioration of electric devices and
soft error due to latch-up phenomenon. In order to
prevent these problems and attain high density, there
have been studied silicon-on-insulator (SOI) techniques
that insulating layers are formed as sidewalls of an
insulating substrate formed of a material such as SiO2
and silicon single crystalline wells are formed in these
insulating layers to form semiconductor devices in the
above wells.These techniques have advantages of perfect
isolation of electrical elements, high speed
performance, latch-up free and soft error free. That is,
a semiconductor device such as CMOS circuits can be
made. Second, the width of insulating layers for 
isolation depends on just photo-etching, etc. Third,
high integration based on the micro-miniaturization can
be obtained as well as the application with three-dimensional
devices. According to the above techniques,
a semiconductor device of SOI structure is formed by
forming an amorphous or polysilicon layer on an
amorphous insulating substrate such as SiO2 and
performing recrystallization on the polysilicon layer.
Separation by implanted oxygen (SIMOX) processes, full
isolation by phorous oxidized silicon (FIPOS) processes,
or zone melting recrystallization (ZMR) are also known
as another approach.Recently, SOI MOSFET formed on a ultra-thin film of
less than 1000 angstroms may be obtained, which has an
effect to removal of kink and improvement of subthreshold
characteristic curve.In addition to this, study has been made in the
manufacture of SOI Gate-All-Around MOSFET structure.
When a lower part of a hook-shape gate is formed
underneath an active silicon region, in order to form an
SOI wafer, a channel length of the lower part is
dependent on a channel width region to be larger than
the lower part of the channel width by isotropic wet
etching, and the thickness of a buried oxide layer is
more than half of the lower part of the channel width
region. Accordingly, there is a limit to increasing the
channel width region. If the thickness of the buried 
oxide layer of the SOI wafer is

A method of making a semiconductor device of silicon-on-insulator
structure comprising the steps of:


a) forming a pad oxide layer (24) on a silicon substrate
(20);
b) implanting oxygen ions into the silicon substrate to
form a buried oxide layer (21) in the silicon substrate (20)

and a silicon layer (23) on the buried oxide layer, the
silicon layer having an upper surface in contact with the pad

oxide layer and a lower surface in contact with the buried
oxide layer;
c) forming an oxynitride region (22) by a nitride
implantation through an opened photoresist layer (PR) at a

position in the buried oxide layer corresponding to a
position where a gate is to be formed underneath the upper

silicon layer (23);
d) photo-etching the pad oxide layer (24) and the
silicon layer (23) to form an active silicon region extending

over the oxynitride region and to expose a portion of the
oxynitride region;
e) selectively wet-etching the structure obtained in
step d) to remove the remaining pad oxide layer to expose the

upper surface of the active silicon region and to partially
remove the oxynitride region which results in the formation

of a cavity underneath the active silicon region such that
the cavity partially exposes the lower surface of the active

silicon region;
f) subjecting the structure obtained in step e) to
thermal oxidation to form a gate insulating layer (26) on the

exposed surfaces of the active silicon region; 
g) depositing polysilicon on the structure of step f) to
form a polysilicon layer (27A,27B) which fills the cavity and

surrounds the active silicon region;
h) patterning the polysilicon layer to form a gate
electrode (28); and
i) forming source (29) and drain (30) regions in the
active silicon region which are separated by said gate

electrode (28).
