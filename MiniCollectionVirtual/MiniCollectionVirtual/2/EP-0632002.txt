<ABSTRACT>
In order to replace chlorodifluoromethane in air-conditioning systems, the invention provides for the use, as refrigerant (refrigerating fluid), of a mixture containing, by mass, 26 to 34% of difluoromethane, 56 to 73% of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane and 1 to 10% of tetrafluoromethane or octafluoropropane.
