Alternate voltage feeder with dissymmetric waves of 
adjustable amplitude and duration, suitable for aluminium 

electrolytic colouring processes, comprising a 
three-phase feed transformer, on whose phases of the 

secondary circuit a direct current rectifier of the 
controlled diode bidirectional type and a ignition 

circuit for said diodes are associated, said ignition 
circuit being constituted by a generator of reference 

waves of the bidirectional type, suitable for generating 
pulses which, after a check on a node with the 

output alternate voltage, and the following amplification 
and transformation, provide to the ignition of 

said diodes; the adjustment of the duration and amplitude 
of the output half waves can be achieved either by 

hand or by a process computer, so as to obtain at the 
outlet reverse polarity and dissymmetric waveforms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a monophase alternate voltage 
electric feeder with dissymmetric waveforms whose 
amplitude and duration is adjustable, particularly 
suitable for carrying out processes of electrolytic 
colouring of aluminium, its alloys and the like. As is known, electrolytic colouring of aluminium and 
its metal alloys is, substantially, an electrolytic 
process carried out in the presence of particular 
colouring metal salts, which, depositing on the surface, 
give the latter the colour required. It is also known that the electrochemical process of 
aluminium electrolyic colouring needs, as a feed source 
of electric power, a feeding device capable of supplying 
a voltage characterized by consecutive reverse 
polarity and means suitable for the necessary adjustment 
of the parameters of said voltage. To this purpose, the feeding apparatuses utilized by 
prior art are normally constituted by a monophase 
transformer, suitable to reduce the alternate voltage 
of the mains to the required value - normally 20-25 V- 
and by systems for adjusting the values of the supplied 
voltage to the process requirements. The systems utilized by prior art for adjusting the 
voltage supplied by the secondary of the transformer 
provide in some cases for the inclusion, above the 
transformer-reducer, of a self-transformer continuously  
 
adjustable through the shifting of sliding brushes; in 
other cases, a set of taps are utilized which are 
inserted on the primary winding of the monophase transformer, 
so that the adjustment of the values of the 
supplied voltage is realizable only "stepwise" and not 
continuously; in this case, compensation means interposed 
between adjacent taps may also be provided. In all these cases, the voltage available also after 
the adjustment is always of the alternate sinusoidal 
type and has the same frequency as the one supplied by 
the main grid system. Feeders are also known which utilize electronic circuits 
capable of realizing a "partialization" of the 
two positive and negative half waves, i. e. of realizing 
incomplete half waves, so that the waveform is 
dissymmetric and may prove useful for special electrolytic 
colouring processes; however, this type of dissymmetric 
waveform has the drawback of involving a 
continuous component, due to the inequalities of the 
two areas of the positive and negative halfwaves, which 
can jeopardise the performance of the transformer, due 
to the possible saturation of its magnet core. In practice, therefore, the feeders utilized by
