<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of horseradish,
sinigrin or allyl isothiocyanate for the preparation of
pharmaceutical compositions topically applicable to affected
mucosa for the treatment of nasal and sinus dysfunction. The
invention also relates to compositions or preparations for
said treatment as well as to methods of making such
compositions.Many people suffer from nasal and sinus dysfunction.
Examples of nasal and sinus dysfunction include allergic and
vasomotor inflammatory conditions of nasal mucous membranes,
sinugenic headaches, post nasal discharge, and the like.Nasal sprays have been used in the treatment of such
nasal and sinus dysfunctions, but are not without drawbacks.
For instance, common nasal sprays containing sympatho-mimetic
compounds, and over-the-counter remedies containing
phenylephrine hydrochloride, oxymetazoline hydrochloride, or
xylometazoline are generally considered to be harmful when used
over long periods of time because they cause damage to nasal
mucosal ciliary function, and they cause rebound mucosal
thickening leading to nasal congestion. The manufacturers of
certain over-the-counter remedies warn that their products
should not be used for more than three days. Also, the use or
abuse of these drugs has resulted in anosmia, prolonged nasal
obstruction, and habituation of the medications. Other nasal sprays in the art include saline nasal
sprays and topical steroid sprays. It is thought that the antiinflammatory
effect of steroid sprays produces a beneficial
reaction in the nasal and sinus mucosa. However, such sprays
can produce mucosal atrophy in post surgical states, and are
generally effective only in reducing inflammation. They
generally have inconsequential decongestant or physiological
mucosal effects in mobilizing secretions or stimulating cells to
evacuate secretions.Another drawback of the prior art preparations is that
a significant segment of the population is reluctant to apply
artificial compositions to their nasal mucosa. As a result,
topical therapy for nasal and sinus dysfunction in this segment
of the population is largely nonexistent.Attempts have been made to produce natural remedies
for certain ailments. For instance, Stammberger has administered
capsaicin P (trans-8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide), the
pungent extract of red pepper, to patients with headaches.
However, the capsaicin has been found to produce only profound
vasodilation, sneezing, and either vasomotor or cholinergic
secretory episodes. Also, the capsaicin is known to destroy
unmyel
