<ABSTRACT>
A power steering apparatus comprises a fluid source (10) for 
discharging pressurized fluid, a power cylinder (12), a control valve 

responsive to operation of a steering wheel for supplying the 
power cylinder with pressurized fluid, and 

a reservoir (11). The control valve has a first control portion for 
controlling the flow of pressurized fluid from the fluid source 

to the reservoir, and a second control portion for controlling 
the flow of pressurized fluid to the power cylinder. The first 

control portion has four paths communicating with the fluid 
source and the reservoir, and each of the four paths is formed 

with a variable orifice (V1-V4) of open-center 
type which is open when the 

control valve is in a neutral state. The second control portion 
has two supply paths communicating with the fluid source and the 

chambers of the power cylinder, each of the two supply 
paths being formed with a variable orifice (V5,V6) 

of semi-open-center type 
which is open when the control valve is in the neutral state, and 

two drain paths communicating with the chambers of the power 
cylinder and the reservoir, each of the two drain paths being 

formed with a variable orifice (V7,V8) of closed-center type which is 
closed when the control valve is in the neutral state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic power steering
apparatus suitable for use in automobiles and the like, and more
particularly, it relates to the improvement of a hydraulic power
steering apparatus described in document EP-A3-0 594 137
which is state of the art according to Art. 54(3) EPC.In a conventional power steering apparatus, center-open
type variable orifices arranged in a rotary control valve
operate immediately to supply the pressurized fluid to one of
power cylinder chambers and to exhaust the fluid from the other
power cylinder chamber even when a steering wheel is turned
slightly from the neutral position. This causes the
differential pressure across a power cylinder to begin to
increase immediately and to more increases gradually as the
rotational angle of the rotary control valve further increases.
Accordingly, the conventional power steering apparatus does not
give the driver a steady steering feeling at around the neutral
position. The applicant of this application has proposed in the
aforementioned document EP-A3-0 594 137 a power steering apparatus
which is designed to increase the rigidity of the steering wheel
at around the neutral position by preventing the differential
pressure across the power cylinder from increasing when the
steering wheel is at around the neutral position.The power steering apparatus as proposed therein is
composed of an engine-driven pump 50, a reservoir 51, a power
cylinder 52 for assisting the steering operation, and a rotary
control valve 53, as shown in FIG. 1. The rotary control valve
53 fluidly controls pressurized fluid which is supplied from the
pump 50 to the power cylinder 52, upon rotation of the steering
wheel (not shown). The control valve 53 is composed of a first
control portion having variable orifices V1-V4 of center-open
type (shown in FIG. 4), and a second control portion having
variable orifices V5 and V6 of semi-center-open type (shown in
FIG 5) communicating to the reservoir 51 and variable orifices
V7 and V8 of center-closed type (shown in FIG. 6) communicating
to the pump 50.The opening area of each of the variable orifice V1-V8 is
varied in correspondence with the relative rotational angle
(valve rotational angle) between a valve shaft 61 and a valve
body 62, as shown in FIG. 7.In the above-mentioned constitution, since the
center-closed variable orifices V7 and V8 are closed in the 
neutral state of the steering operation, the pressurized fluid
is not supplied to the power cylinder 52. In such a state, both
