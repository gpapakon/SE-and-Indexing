<ABSTRACT>
Hob with an annular cermet tool body (12) which has teeth (20) on the periphery and is preferably attached to a cylindrical steel core (14), e.g. by brazing in a vacuum furnace. The basic element of the hob body (12) is a sintered cermet blank which has axially parallel grooves at the periphery and the tooth system of which is completed by grinding. The basic element can have helical grooves. The grooves are ground from the solid. The tool body (12a, 12b) can have laterally arranged driving prominences or recesses (30, 32), e.g. radially running grooves (30).   The tool body (12) is provided with a hard protective coating, preferably of titanium nitride.

<CLAIMS>
A hob with an annular tool body (12) which is of cermet, 
which comprises teeth (20) on its periphery, and which is mounted 

onto a cylindrical steel core (14). 
A hob according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
annular tool body (12) is fastened onto the steel core (14), e.g. 

by soldering in the vacuum furnace. 
A hob according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
original body of the tool body (12) is a sintered blank of cermet 

which has axially parallel grooves at the periphery and whose 
toothing is produced by grinding. 
A hob according to claim 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
original body comprises helical grooves. 
A hob according to claim 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
grooves are ground from solid material. 
A hob according to claim 1, characterised in that the tool 
body (12a, 12b) comprises laterally arranged projections or 

recesses (30, 32), e.g. radially extending grooves (30). 
A hob according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the tool body (12) is provided with a hard material coating, 

preferably of titanium nitride.
