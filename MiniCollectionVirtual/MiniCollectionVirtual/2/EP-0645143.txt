<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of a drug useful in
the preparation of a medicament for preventing and treating
ulcers and tumors on the gastric mucosa, and other disorders.As antiulcer agents for treating ulcers on the
gastric mucosa, H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors which
aim at suppressing gastric acid secretion, have been used.
However, gastric ulcers frequently recur after
discontinuation of the administration of these secretion-suppressing
drugs.In recent years, a certain bacterium Helicobacter
pylori has been identified as participating in the occurrence
of ulcers on the gastric mucosa. This bacterium is believed
to adhere to the gastric mucosa, where it produces ammonia
which induces gastritis and, in its turn, gastric ulcer or
cancer. See Anti-Infectious Agent and Diseases, 1993, pp.
294-309.Because this bacterium adheres to the gastric
submucous tissue, extermining the bacterium by administering
drugs such as antibiotics is very difficult. Although
attempts have been made to exterminate Helicobacter pylori by
the combined use of several antibiotics with proton pump
inhibitors, such treatments must administer a large amounts 
of antibiotics over a long time period. In such treatments,
various problems accompanying the appearance of an
antibiotic-tolerant strain undesirably might be induced.Helicobacter pylori recognizes cholesterol,
glycolipids, sulfated glycolipids, laminin, fucosylated sugar
chains and sialic acid on the gastric mucosa and thus adheres
to the gastric mucosa (Moran, A.P. et al., Journal of
Applied Bacteriology 1993, 75, 184-189; Lingwood, C.A.
et al., Infection and Immunity 1993, 61, 2474-2478).
Therefore, attempts have been made to prevent gastric
mucosa inflammation due to Helicobacter pylori by
interfering with the process of the recognition of these
compounds by Helicobacter pylori and the adhesion of the
bacterium to the gastric mucosa (Huesca, M. et al., Zbl.
Bakt. 1993, 280, 244-252). Examples of substances
which have been reported as inhibitors for the adhesion of
Helicobacter pylori include fetuin (which inhibits the
adhesion via sialic acid) and secretory IgA (which inhibits
the adhesion via a fucosylated sugar chain). However, these
substances have not been put into practical use as adhesion
inhibitors for Helicobacter pylori, since they cannot he
supplied on a mass scale.On the other hand, the present inventors previously
have found that the cells of a certain bacterium belonging to
the genus Bifidobacterium or lactic acid bacteria and
polysaccharides
