<ABSTRACT>
Multiple special service numbers, such as 800 numbers, that are owned 
by a customer are routed using a single, common routing plan. An 800 number 

database system (114) which provides routing information for 800 number calls is 
configured to compare a dialed 800 telephone number (e.g., by 102) received from a 

telephone switching system (106) with telephone numbers stored in the database 
memory (118). Corresponding to each of the stored telephone numbers and stored 

within the database memory is a pointer to a routing plan to be used in processing 
and routing calls placed to the respective telephone number (e.g., 112). Upon 

finding a match between the dialed 800 telephone number and a stored telephone 
number, the 800 number database provides an indication of the appropriate routing 

plan to be used to route the dialed 800 telephone number. The 800 database then 
determines from the selected routing plan how to route the call.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for routing special service 
calls, such as calls which require translating a dialed telephone number into another 
number before the call can be routed. Many businesses use special service numbers, such as socalled "toll-free" or "800" 
numbers, to allow consumers to easily communicate with the business. So-called 
"advanced 800 number features" provide the owner of an 800 number (an "800 number 
customer") with various options for routing calls placed to the 800 number. These options 
are implemented in software through the use of an 800 number "routing plan" The 
routing plan enables call routing decisions to be based, for example, on the time of day, 
the caller's country code or area code, or other such information. Each 800 number is 
routed according to its own routing plan, which can be modified by an 800 number 
customer as desired to suit the 800 number customer's needs. Larger 800 number customers often have more than one 800 number. For example, 
a telemarketer who provides marketing services for hundreds or thousands of different 
manufacturers may have a different 800 number for each manufacturer that the 
telemarketer represents. However, because calls to each 800 number are routed according 
to a routing plan associated only with that 800 number, changes applicable to many 800 
numbers must be made individually to many routing plans. The effort required to 
implement a change increases rapidly as the number of routing plans increases. Routing of multiple special service numbers, such as 800 numbers, that are owned 
by a customer is simplified, in accordance with the invention, by routing two or more of 
such numbers using a single routing plan. By using a single, common routing plan to  
 
route calls placed to several 800 numbers, a change in the common routing plan effects 
changes to the call routing of all of the 800 numbers. This eliminates the considerable 
labor and time that otherwise would be required to implement identical changes to several 
or all of an 800 number customer's routing plans. In the telemarketer example described 
above, use of a common routing plan for all of the telemarketer's 800 numbers would 
enable the telemarketer to change the routing of calls to more than a thousand 800 
numbers by making a single change to the common routing plan. Also, new 800 numbers 
can be added easily without developing and maintaining additional routing plans. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, an 800 number

<CLAIMS>
A method for use in a system which routes special services calls according 
to a routing plan, the method comprising the steps of: 

   storing a routing plan; and 
   responding to each of at least two different special service calls made to respective 

different telephone numbers to select said routing plan as the routing plan for routing each 
of said calls. 
The invention of claim 1 further comprising the step of processing the calls 
according to the selected routing plan. 
The invention of claim 2 further comprising the step of routing the calls in 
a predetermined manner in response to a predetermined dialed telephone number. 
The invention of claim 1 wherein the telephone numbers are 800 telephone 
numbers. 
The invention of claim 1 wherein the telephone numbers are 900 telephone 
numbers. 
A system which routes special services calls according to a routing plan, 
comprising: 

   means storing a routing plan; and 
   means for responding to each of at least two different special service calls made 

to respective different telephone numbers to select said routing plan as the routing plan 
for routing each of said calls. 
The invention of claim 11 further comprising means for processing the calls 
according to the selected routing plan. 
The invention of claim 12 further comprising means for routing the calls 
in a predetermined manner in response to a predetermined dialed telephone number. 
The invention of claim 11 wherein the telephone numbers are 800 telephone 
numbers. 
The invention of claim 11 wherein the telephone numbers are 900 telephone 
numbers. 
The invention of claim 11 wherein the means for responding comprises: 
   means for receiving one of the at least two different telephone numbers;

 
   means for comparing the received telephone number with a plurality of 

predetermined telephone numbers which represent telephone numbers to be routed 
according to the routing plan; and 

   means for selecting the routing plan for routing the call in response to a match of 
the received telephone number and one of the plurality of predetermined telephone 

numbers.
