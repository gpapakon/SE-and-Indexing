<ABSTRACT>
This invention pertains to a disk brake which 
can solve problems such as lengthening 

travel of the lever, securing the brake 
lever, widening the mean coil diameter of the return 

spring, reducing the complexity of assembly 
and reducing the number 

of parts by eliminating the gap between the brake 
lever and the camshaft by means of caulking. 
The disk brake of this invention, 
is characterised by a non-circular 

connection (22) formed on the exposed area of the 
camshaft (2) which is connected to a non-circular connecting 

bore (32) drilled in the brake lever (3) and 
fixing the camshaft (2) to the brake lever (3) by means 

of caulking at.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a disk brake as defined by the
features of the preamble of claim 1.A conventional disk brake is shown in Figs. 8 and 9. A
similar disk brake of this type is disclosed in GB-2 165
903A. Both sides of a rotor (a) as shown in Fig. 8, which
rotates with a wheel, may be brought in contact with friction
pads (bl, b2). A caliper (c) is arranged overriding the rotor
(a) and the friction pads (bl, b2). A bearing bore (d) as shown
in Fig. 9 is provided at the backward of the caliper (c) and
a camshaft (e) is installed in the bearing bore (d). A brake
lever (f) is attached to an exposed portion (e') of the
camshaft (e) and screwed up by a nut (g). A return spring (h)
applying a force in a non-operative direction is arranged
arround the nut (g). A push rod (j), one end of which is
contacted with the camshaft (e) and the other end of which is
contacted with a wellknown automatic adjustment device (i) linked
with an unillustrated piston contacted with the back side of
one of the friction pads (b2), is installed in the bearing
bore (d).As described above, the camshaft (e) is rotated through
the brake lever (f) when an operating wire (k) is pulled and
the push rod (j) moves the piston forward through the
automatic adjustment device. Forward movement of this piston makes
one of the friction pads (b2) contact the rotor (a) under
pressure, and also the other friction pad (bl) contacts the
rotor (a) under pressure by the reaction of it. Thus, the
rotor (a) can be applied with the brake force.The above described conventional disk brake has the
following problems.
1) A small clearance, which.occurs at the connection (1)
between the brake lever (f) and the camshaft (e), gives a 
play to the brake lever and it is one reason for lengthening
of the lever travel.2) The nut (g) fixed to the camshaft (e) is getting
loose by the above described recess and the worst case the
brake lever falls off.3) The mean coil diameter of the return spring is
widening.4) The assembling process to screw up the nut (g) is
additionally necessary and the number of parts is increased.In another disk brake known from DE 42 17 983 A1 a brake
lever is pressed onto a circular circumference of a camshaft
which is provided with the known multi-tooth profile. The end
of the camshaft slightly protruding beyond the brake lever is
completely riveted to fix the brake lever at the camshaft.
The multi-tooth profile has the disadvantage that an
appropriate mounting position is not clearly defined which
leads to more difficult operations

<CLAIMS>
A disk brake comprising

a rotor rotatable with a wheel,
friction pads located at both sides of the rotor;
a caliper (1) overriding a part of the outer
circumference of the rotor and the friction pads;
a pushing member (13) installed in the caliper (1) for
pressing at least one of the friction pads to the rotor;
a bearing bore (11) provided within the caliper at the
rear side of the pushing member (13);
a camshaft (2) rotatably installed within the bearing
bore (11) for moving forward and backward the pushing member

(13), a part of the camshaft (2) being exposed outside of the
bearing bore (11);
a brake lever (3) attached and fixed to the exposed part
of the camshaft (2); and
a return spring (4) for urging the brake lever (3) in a
nonoperative direction;

   characterized in that

said brake lever (3) has a non-circular connecting bore
(32), the shape of which is elliptical or polygon such as

square or hexagon, and said exposed part of the camshaft (2)
has a connection portion (22) formed in a corresponding non-circular

shape and
the camshaft (2) is fixed to the brake lever (3) by
caulking said connection portion (22) and/or the upper

surface of the brake lever (3) at said connecting bore (32)
after the brake lever (3) is installed with its connecting

bore (32) around the connection portion (22) of the camshaft
(2).
The disk brake according to claim 1, characterized in
that the connection portion (22) of the exposed part of the

camshaft (2) comprises first and second stepped portions
(24,25) adjacent the connection portion (22), wherein the

first stepped portion (24) is located at the lower surface
level of the brake lever (3) and the second stepped portion

(25) is located slightly above or below the upper surface
level of the brake lever (3) and caulking is performed at the

second stepped portion (25) and/or at the upper surface of
the brake lever (3).
The disk brake according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the caulking is performed all around the non-circular

connection or at a part of the non-circular connection.
