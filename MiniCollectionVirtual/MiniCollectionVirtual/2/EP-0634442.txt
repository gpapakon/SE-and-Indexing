<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to radiation cured conjugated diene-vinyl 
aromatic hydrocarbon block copolymers which are cured at low 
radiation doses. More particularly, the invention relates to 
improved cross-linking of such epoxidized polymers. Curing of adhesives based on conjugated diolefins and vinyl 
aromatics has increased the range of service properties for such 
adhesives. Radiation curing of polymers to make such adhesives is 
known. Curing of coatings and sealants based on these polymers has 
reduced solvent content required for such products. This curing 
causes covalent cross-linking of the polymerized conjugated 
diolefins which is evidenced by a high gel content of the cross-linked 
polymer. Before cross-linking, the polymers are melt and 
solution processable but after cross-linking, the gel cannot be 
processed as melts or in solution. Cross-linking therefore enhances 
solvent resistance and improves elevated temperature shear 
properties, toughness and cohesion. Compositions can therefore be 
applied to a substrate in a melt or from solution and then cross-linked 
to form a superior adhesive, coating or sealant. However, 
improvements in the adhesives, coatings and sealants could be made 
if the adhesives could be cured at lower dosages of radiation. Epoxidized block copolymers of conjugated diolefins and vinyl 
aromatic hydrocarbons have been disclosed as being useful in 
radiation cured adhesive, coating and sealant compositions (see 
allowed copending application Serial No. 692,839, filed April 29, 
1991, entitled "Viscous Conjugated Diene Block Copolymers"). Such 
polymers were said to be curable using electron beam and ultraviolet 
radiation. It has been found that epoxidized polymers of conjugated 
dienes which also contain aromatic moieties require much more  
 
irradiation when ultraviolet radiation is used to cure the polymers 
than such polymers which do not contain aromatic moieties. Such 
aromatic moieties may be provided by a vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon 
monomer which is copolymerized with the conjugated diene or they may 
be provided when an aromatic coupling agent such as divinyl benzene 
is used to couple polymer arms together. Radiation curing of such polymers is not an inexpensive 
process. Increasing the amount of irradiation necessary to cure a 
polymer increases the overall cost of producing the product. 
Therefore, it would be advantageous to provide a method wherein 
epoxidized diene polymers which contain aromatic moieties could be 
cured to the same extent with
