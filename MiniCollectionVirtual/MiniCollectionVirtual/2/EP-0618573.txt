<ABSTRACT>
A head drum for use in a video cassette recorder is 
coated with a protective layer comprising either titanium 

nitride or diamond-like carbon. The protective layer of 
titanium nitride is obtained using a hollow-cathode-deposition 

process and has a thickness ranging from 0.5µm to 5.0µm. The 
protective layer of diamond-like carbon is obtained using a 

plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition process and has a 
thickness ranging from 0.3µm to 5.0µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video cassette 
recorder("VCR"); and, more particularly, to an improved head 
drum for use in a VCR having a protective layer comprising 
either titanium nitride or diamond-like carbon on the surface 
thereof. As is well known, one of the primary roles of a head drum 
in a VCR is to provide stability to the magnetic tape 
travelling along a defined path within the VCR without 
damaging or adversely affecting the tape. In order to fulfill 
this role, the surface of the drum which is in contact with 
the moving tape is designed in such a way that it has 
macroscopic smoothness and yet, microscopically, is provided 
on its surface with a plurality of undulations running along 
the direction normal to the rotational axis thereof in order 
to reduce the friction therebetween. Inasmuch as another 
design requirement thereof lies in the protection of the 
information recorded on the tape, the head drum is usually 
made of a non-magnetic material. The head drum has been hitherto made primarily of an  
 
aluminum alloy such as Al-Si, Al-Cu or a variation thereof. 
Above the surface of the head drum made of such an aluminum 
alloy, there is formed a layer of aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) in the 
thickness of a few nm, said layer being in physical contact 
and interacting with the lubricating and magnetic layer of the 
tape. Since the layer of Al₂O₃ formed on the head drum surface 
is of an insufficient thickness, i.e., too thin, the 
mechanical properties of the Al₂O₃ layer will be largely 
influenced by the mechanical properties of the aluminum alloy 
constituting the head drum. In other words, the effect of the 
Al₂O₃ layer can be virtually ignored and the overall mechanical 
properties of the head drum surface can simply be regarded as 
those of the surface made of the aluminum alloy alone. During 
a normal operation of the VCR, since such magnetic powders in 
the magnetic layer as γ-Fe₂O₃, Fe and the like are harder than 
the aluminum alloy as shown in Table 2 hereof, the magnetic 
powders will, in addition to scratching and wearing down the 
head drum surface, become embedded on the head drum 
surface. Those embedded magnetic powders, in addition to 
scratching the tape surface, when accumulated in enough 
quantities, will form a layer on the surface of the head drum, 
which will in turn affect magnetically the information stored 
on the tape itself, thereby harming the quality of the 
picture. Furthermore, since the head drum is designed by taking  
 
into consideration such
