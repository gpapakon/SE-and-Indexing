<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tire abnormal condition alarming 
system as indicated in the precharacterizing part of claim 1. Such a prior art system (EP-A-0 291 412) operates as follows: Upon detection of the abnormal condition of the tire, the 
device transmits an abnormal condition detection signal as an 
aerial propagation signal, and when a signal receiver receives 
the abnormal  
 
condition detection signal, informing means or the like is 
operated to inform the user of the occurrence of the abnormal 
condition. More specifically, the abnormal condition signal 
transmitting device coupled to the tire operates to detect the 
loosening of the hub nuts 
of the tire, to output the abnormal condition detection signal. The device is designed for instance as follows: 
Contact pieces are interposed between the tire wheel and the 
hub nuts adapted to fix the latter, thus forming abnormal 
condition detecting switches. When the hub nuts have been 
suitably fixed, the contact pieces are grounded through the 
wheel and the hub, and therefore the switches are held turned 
on. And when the hub nuts are loosened to electrically 
disconnect the contact pieces from the tire wheel, the switches 
are turned off. Furthermore, in another prior art system an air pressure sensor is coupled 
to the tire, and another abnormal condition detecting switch is 
provided which is turned off when the air pressure of the tire 
detected by the air pressure sensor is lower than a 
predetermined value. When, in the abnormal condition signal transmitting 
device thus constructed, those abnormal condition detecting 
switches are turned off, transistors provided for the latter 
are turned on to provide abnormal condition detection signals, 
respectively. The above-described conventional device suffers from 
the following difficulties: When the abnormal condition  
 
detecting switches detect the abnormal condition, the outputs 
of the switches change from ground level floating level to turn 
on the transistors. For this purpose, it is necessary to 
ground the circuit of the abnormal condition signal 
transmitting device. Accordingly, it is necessary to extend a 
grounding line from the device and to connect it to the part of 
the tire wheel which is at ground level. This line connecting 
operation is rather troublesome in coupling the device to the 
tire. Furthermore, in order to control the on-off operations 
of the transistors in association with the detecting operations 
of the abnormal condition detecting switches, it is necessary
