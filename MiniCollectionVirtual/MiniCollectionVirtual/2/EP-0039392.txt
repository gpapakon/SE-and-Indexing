<ABSTRACT>
A new semiconductive device for sensing uniaxial 
magnetic fields is described. The sensor is essentially a 

dual collector lateral bipolar transistor operated in the 
avalanche region. Each of the collectors (1) exhibits two 

space charge resistance effects. One effect produces a 
negative resistance and the other produces a positive 

resistance. When the two space charge resistances are 
carefully balanced, a net zero collector resistance is achie­

ved. A balanced condition can be maintained for a broad 
range of collector currents. A vertical V-I property is there­

by achieved. It has been found that the positive space 
charge resistance characteristic is inversely proportional 

to the ionization area and that the negative component is 
proportional to the area in the avalanche zone at each 

collector. It has been found that a magnetic field can mo­
dulate the ionization areas at the collector junctions. The 

area modulated results in modulation of the positive and 
negative space charge resistances at each collector and a 

resultant shift in the avalanche voltage occurs for each col­
lector. A differential output may be obtained since thei mo­

dulation effect operates oppositely on each of the collector 
junction areas. This mechanism accounts for the linear and 

differential magnetoresistive behavoir of the device.
