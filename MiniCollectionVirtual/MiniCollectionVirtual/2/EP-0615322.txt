<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi
quantum well semiconductor laser. In particular, the
present invention relates to a multi quantum well
semiconductor laser suitable for a light source for
optical communications used in a CATV and the like, in
which signals are transmitted by a plurality of carrier
waves, and to an optical communication system using the
multi quantum well semiconductor laser as a light
source for information transmission.Barrier bandgap wavelengths of 1.15 µm are related throughout the application to examples useful for the understanding of the invention.In recent years, an analog multiple light
transmission system has been introduced into the field
of image transmission, particularly, a CATV. In such
an analog multiple light transmission system, the
transmission of light (40 channels, about 10 km) using
AM modulation has reached a practical level. As a
light source used in the system, a long wavelength
bandwidth semiconductor laser having a low noise, low
transmission distortion characteristic is required. An
example of such a light source includes a distributed-feedback
semiconductor laser (hereinafter, referred to
as a DFB laser) using an InGaAsP/InP material.In the case where the number of channels
increases to 40 or more, the modulation frequency bandwidth
is required to be 300 MHz or more. It is known
that the increase in modulation frequency bandwidth
rapidly increases frequency distortion because modulation
frequencies close to a relaxation oscillation 
frequency; as a result, a low transmission distortion
characteristic cannot be obtained (Electronics Letters
Vol. 28 No. 9 (1992) 891).Under the above-mentioned circumstances, in
order to widen a modulation frequency bandwidth and
achieve a higher relaxation oscillation frequency, a
DFB laser having a multi quantum well structure as an
active layer has been fabricated.Figure 6 shows a structure of a representative
1.3 µm wavelength DFB semiconductor laser used for
40 channel-10 km transmission. The DFB laser includes
an n-type InP substrate 1 and a stripe-shaped cavity
formed on the substrate 1. The stripe-shaped cavity
includes a diffraction grating 2 with a period of
200 nm formed on the n-type InP substrate 1, an n-type
InGaAsP optical wave guide layer 12 (thickness:
0.15 µm, bandgap wavelength (composition wavelength)
λg = 1.15 µm), a 10-layered quantum well active
layer 4, a p-type InGaAsP optical wave guide layer 13
(thickness: 30 nm, λg = 1.15 µm), and a p-type InP
cladding layer 6. The quantum well active layer 4
