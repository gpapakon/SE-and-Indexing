<ABSTRACT>
A sealing (1) made of plastic. The sealing (1) has an actual sealing portion (2) made of plastic, within and/or on the outer surface of which sealing fibers (3) are provided that expand or swell on the action of a medium to be sealed, such as a liquid, steam or gas; these fibers provide sealing for the joint on the action of the medium that has entered the joint, and enhance the mechanical strength of the joint.

<DESCRIPTION>
SealingThe present invention relates to a sealing to be laid between two surfaces and preventing a liquid or gaseous medium from flowing out from the gap between the surfaces, the sealing being made of a plastic material.Sealings are employed in various pipe joints and also in other devices assembled of parts for the pre- vention of escape of liquid within said pipe joint or device through such joints. Sealings are either sheet¬ like, cut in various ways and into various shapes, or strip-like or cord-like sealings to be wound on the thread of a threaded joint when the joint is produced. Sheet-like sealings are manufactured from dif¬ ferent materials, such as plastic, impregnated paper etc., and their sealing capability is based on the fact that they are compressed between opposite sur¬ faces with bolts or other similar clamping means. For sealing threaded joints of pipes, a solution is known where pipe putty is applied to the juncture and flax tow is wound in the thread, so that when the pipe joint is tightened these means seal the gaps between the threads. Furthermore, today a teflon sealing strip that is wound on the thread of the pipe joint prior to tightening of the joint is commonly used.Installing flax tow by means of pipe putty is dirty and cumbersome, wherefore it has largely been abandoned. A sealing employing a teflon band is prob- lematic in that if it is not seated correctly in the thread upon winding, it will not provide tight seal¬ ing, but water or gas can issue therefrom. Teflon band also has the drawback that, being insensitive to liquids and gases - i.e. not interacting with liquid or gas - it cannot seal a leaking spot through swell- 

ing or similar.It is an object of the present invention to pro¬ vide a sealing that affords easy and simple sealing while the sealing properties are good. The sealing of the invention is characterized in that sealing fibers that expand or swell upon contact with the medium to be sealed are laid during manufacture on the surface of and/or inside the plastic material that forms the sealing, thus increasing the sealing effect of the sealing.The essential idea of the invention is that the sealing material is a thin plastic film, such as pre¬ ferably teflon, and during manufacture, fibers of a suitable fibrous material are attached within and/or to the surface of the teflon, so that fiber is pro¬ vided at the entire joint to be sealed, and thus the liquid or steam tending to escape through the joint will come into contact with the fiber. Specifically, when

 Claims:
1. A sealing (1 ) to be laid between two surfaces and preventing a liquid or gaseous medium from flowing out from the gap between the surfaces, the sealing (1) being made of a plastic material and fibers (3) being laid during manufacture on the surface of and/or with¬ in the plastic material that forms the sealing (1), c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that said fibers (3) are sealing fibers that expand or swell upon contact with the medium to be sealed, thus increasing the sealing effect of the sealing (1) .
2. A sealing as claimed in claim 1, c h a r ¬ a c t e r i z e d in that the sealing (1) is shaped as a sealing strip and that the sealing fibers (3) are laid substantially in the longitudinal direction of the sealing strip.
3. A sealing as claimed in claim 1, c h a r ¬ a c t e r i z e d in that the sealing (1) is shaped to be sheet-like and that the sealing fibers (3) are laid in crosswise relation with respect to the surface of the sheet.
4. A sealing as claimed in claim 1, c h a r ¬ a c t e r i z e d in that the sealing (1) is shaped to be annular and that the sealing fibers are laid substantially annularly.
5. A sealing as claimed in any one of the pre¬ ceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that at least some of the sealing fibers (3) are laid on the outer surface of the sealing (1) .
6. A sealing as claimed in any one of the pre¬ ceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that at least some of the sealing fibers (3) are fed within the plastic material that forms the sealing (1) during the manufacture of said sealing. 


 7. A sealing as claimed in any one of the pre¬ ceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that at least some of the sealing fibers (3) are laid with¬ in the plastic material that forms the sealing ( 1) in random array.
8. A sealing as claimed in any one of the pre¬ ceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the sealing fibers (3) are continuous long fibers.
9. A sealing as claimed in any one of claims 1- 7, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the sealing fibers (3) are of flax and that the plastic material that forms the sealing is teflon.
10. A sealing as claimed in any one of claims 1- 8, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the sealing fibers (3) are fibers expanding or swelling on the action of an oil-based medium.
