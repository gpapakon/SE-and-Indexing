<ABSTRACT>
A carbon containing paste for use in particular as components of electrolytic cells as such or compacted to form anodes, cathodes and cell linings of cells for the electrolysis of alumina for the production of aluminium, consists of a compact mixture of one or more particulate carbonaceous material(s) with a non-carbonaceous non-polluting binder and optionally with one or more fillers, especially alumina and aluminium, the binder being a suspension of one or more colloids such as colloidal silica, alumina, yttria, ceria, thoria, zirconia, magnesia, lithia or being derived from one or more colloid precursors or colloid reagents optionally with one or more chelating agents. Cell components are produced by forming the paste to a desired shape and size, for instance in a mold, an injection die or in a cell bottom, compacting and drying before use, or the paste can be used as such like in a Soderberg type anode, or for bonding together carbon blocks like a ramming paste.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a carbon containing paste
for use in particular as components of electrolytic cells as
such or compacted to form anodes, cathodes and cell linings
of cells for the electrolysis of alumina for the production
of aluminium, as well as masses, bodies and cell components
obtained by solidifying this paste, methods of manufacturing
cell components and other bodies, and their application in
particular as cell components for aluminium production. The
invention also pertains to the carbon containing paste and
resulting solidified bodies for other uses.Aluminium is produced by the electrolysis of alumina
dissolved in molten cryolite. The electrolytic cell known as
the Hall-HÃ©roult cell, uses anodes consisting of a compacted
mixture of petroleum coke and pitch. The cathodes are made
from carbon blocks which are predominantly anthracite,
metallurgical coke, graphite and pitch and form the cell
bottom and the cell walls.Although significant technological refinements in the
cell design and construction have been made, the basic 
process of producing aluminium still remains substantially
similar to what it was one hundred years ago. Carbonaceous
materials are still the main lining material used today in
the cell.The carbon anode blocks are consumed during
electrolysis and must be replaced every four or five weeks of
operation in standard cells. The oxygen resulting from the
decomposition of alumina burns the carbon anode at a
theoretical rate of approximately 330 kg per ton of aluminium
produced, but in practice the carbon consumption is about
450kg per ton of aluminium due to side reactions. This
results in the emission of carbon oxides, sulfur oxides and
other undesirable gases which are now being recognized as
major atmosphere polluants, but such emissions are
considerably less dangerous and less polluting than those
produced during fabrication of the carbon anodes with pitch
as a binder.At present, the method of producing carbon blocks to
be used as anodes and cathodes in aluminium production cells
consists of mixing petroleum coke with pitch for the anode
and anthracite and other carbonaceous materials with pitch
for the cathode, followed by compacting and calcining.
Calcining designates a baking process in which volatiles are
driven off at high temperatures without fusing the material.The fabrication of the carbon anodes and cathodes
involves the use of pitch. During fabrication, gases are
emitted especially from the pitch during the long period
required for calcining the blocks. These
