<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method of pretreating 
a porous medium for use in filtering a protein-containing 

fluid, such as milk, beer, wine, or the like, which method 
comprises contacting a porous medium with an aqueous 

citrate solution prior to passing the protein-containing 
fluid through the porous medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to a method of treating 
a porous medium prior to use in filtering a protein-containing 
fluid in such a manner so as to significantly 
increase the time during which useful filtration can be 
carried out and so as to forestall the clogging of the 
porous medium. Porous media, particularly microporous membranes, are 
used to filter a variety of fluids. During the course of 
filtering fluids, the porous media eventually become 
clogged or plugged with impurities and/or other fluid 
components. This is particularly a problem in the 
filtration of protein-containing fluids. Natural proteins, 
such as those in milk, beer, and wine, can quickly plug 
porous media such as microporous membranes. In the 
filtration of such protein-containing fluids, it is 
typically desirable to maintain a constant filtrate flow 
through the porous medium by increasing the upstream 
pressure over time. As a result, however, pore clogging 
increases, and the flow through the porous medium becomes 
impeded, at an exponential rate. Thus, even though fluid 
can perhaps be passed through the porous medium with a high 
upstream applied pressure, e.g., more than 15 psi, the 
effective life of the porous medium is essentially over 
when an undesirably high upstream pressure, e.g., about 5-10 
psi or so, is required to maintain satisfactory filtrate 
flow through the porous medium. While a clogged filtration medium can be replaced, the 
costs involved in such replacement can be quite 
significant. Thus, many techniques have been developed to 
unclog porous media. These unclogging techniques, however, 
may damage porous media, particularly microporous 
membranes, or leave contaminants in the porous media if not  
 
thoroughly washed prior to reuse. In addition, both the 
replacement of porous media and the unclogging procedures 
typically involve halting the filtration process, thereby 
resulting in potentially significant and undesirable 
downtime in the filtration process. Accordingly, there remains a need for a method of 
filtering a protein-containing fluid through a porous 
medium, particularly a microporous membrane, such that 
clogging of the porous medium is forestalled and filtration 
downtime is reduced. Such a method should also provide for 
an increased period of time during which useful filtration 
of a protein-containing fluid can be carried out, without 
a significantly increased upstream pressure to maintain a 
constant filtrate flow through the porous medium. 
Furthermore, such a method
