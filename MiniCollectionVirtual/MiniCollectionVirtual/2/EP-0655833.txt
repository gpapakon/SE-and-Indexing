<ABSTRACT>
An oscillator circuit with enhanced frequency 
characteristics is provided. This oscillator circuit includes a 

buffer (102) to amplify the output signal and provide positive 
feedback, an inverter (106) to provide negative feedback to cause 

oscillation, a capacitive divider circuit (110, 112) for charge 
storage, a resistor (116) to provide controlled discharge, and a 

diode circuit (114) for providing frequency stability. Since 
frequency stability is included within the oscillator circuit, there 

may be no need to perform resistor trimming at the time of 
manufacture. Further, the capacitive divider circuit eliminates 

parasitic charge injection.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, in general, to circuits and , more 
particularly, to a square wave oscillator circuit. A square wave oscillator is used for generating the clocking 
signal in synchronous digital systems such as computers, 
communications equipment, and electronic devices for automotive 
applications. In such applications, maintaining a stable clock 
frequency, thus oscillator frequency, is necessary for the proper 
operation of the equipment. The stable oscillator frequency must 
be maintained despite having wide temperature variations in the 
operating environment of the equipment such as under the hood of 
an automobile. In the past, adjustments to obtain proper oscillator 
frequency were accomplished by various methods of trimming the 
resistance value of the oscillator circuit. However, trimming the 
resistance value at the time of manufacture of the oscillator does 
not provide frequency stability when the oscillator is operating in 
an environment of wide ranging temperature. Hence, there exists a need for an oscillator which can 
maintain frequency stability while operating at a wide 
temperature range FIG. 1 is a block/schematic diagram illustrating a square 
wave oscillator circuit in accordance with the invention; FIG. 2 is a detailed schematic/block diagram of an alternate 
embodiment of a square wave oscillator circuit in accordance with 
the present invention;  FIG. 3 is a graphic plot illustrating the frequency response of 
an output signal of the oscillator circuit of FIG.'s 1 and 2 with 
respect to temperature; FIG. 4 is a graphic plot illustrating a voltage signal appearing 
at a node of the circuit of FIG.'s 1 and 2 with respect to time; and FIG. 5 is a graphic plot illustrating a voltage signal at a node 
in a comparable prior art oscillator. Generally, the present invention provides a circuit for 
generating an oscillation signal having enhanced frequency 
characteristics. This is accomplished by a set of integrated 
components including a buffer to amplify the signal and provide 
positive feedback, an inverter for negative feedback to cause 
oscillation, a capacitive divider for charge storage, a resistor 
to provide a controlled discharge, and a set of diodes to provide 
frequency stability. The output of the device provides a square-wave oscillation 
suitable for clocking digital circuitry. The frequency of 
operation remains relatively constant as operating temperature 
varies. The unit operates from a stable supply voltage and thus 
circuitry for compensating for supply
