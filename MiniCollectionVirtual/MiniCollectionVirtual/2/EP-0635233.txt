<ABSTRACT>
A clamping element for fastening, in a manner which uncouples structure-borne sound, the edges of bath tubs and shower trays with respect to a building wall is described, said clamping element being supported with predeterminable clamping force, on the one hand, against the wall and, on the other hand, on an insulating-material layer lying against a vertical section of the edge of the tub or tray, which section in turn is supported with respect to the building wall via an insulating-material layer.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for the fixation of the rims of bath tubs and shower tubs
with respect to a wall of a construction in a manner decoupled from

structure-borne noise, comprising a clamping element (4) with a
support limb (5) intended for contact at the wall (3) and a clamping

limb (6) which acts against the inner side (10) of the rim (2) of the
tub, and also a clamping screw (7) which engages at the clamping

element (4) between the support and clamping limbs (5, 6), wherein
layers of insulating material are arranged between the wall (3) and

the outer side (9) of the tub rim (2), on the one hand, and between
the clamping limb (6) and the inner side (10) of the tub rim (2), on

the other hand, characterized in that the clamping screw (7) can be
screwed into the wall and in that a spacer member (8) is provided

between the clamping element (4) and the wall (3), which restricts
the clamping force of the clamping limb (6).
Apparatus in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the
spacer member (8) comprises a sleeve, through which the cla
mping
screw (7) extends.
Apparatus in accordance with claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in
that the clamping element (4) is substantially U-shaped, with the

clamping limb (5) preferably having a substantially greater length
than the clamping limb (6), and the central part (16) of the clamping

element (4) having a through-opening for the clamping screw (7), of
which the head part acts on the central part (16) via an insulating

intermediate layer. 
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the clamping limb (6) acts on the insulating material

layer (12) associated with the inner side of the tub rim (2) via a
contact pressure element (13), which is spaced by an insulating

material layer (12) with respect to the tub rim (2).
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the insulating material layer (12) associated with the

inner side (10) of the tub rim (2) has a cutout for receiving the contact
pressure element (13).
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the insulating material layer (12) associated with the

inner side (10) of the tub rim (2) is essentially matched in a form-fitting
manner to the tub rim (2), which is formed with a U-shaped

cross-section.
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the insulating material layer (11) associated with the

outer side of the tub rim (2) is attached to an edge strip (17) secured
at the wall side.
Apparatus in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that a holding member (14) is mounted at the wall side

above the edge strip (17) for the insulating material layer (11) and
serves for the attachment, in particular for the snap fitted attachment

of a sealing strip (15), in particular a soft elastic sealing strip
(15), which extends from the wall (3) up to the tub rim (2).
