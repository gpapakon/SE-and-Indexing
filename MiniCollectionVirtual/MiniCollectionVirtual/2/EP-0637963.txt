<ABSTRACT>
Immunotherapy of the present invention involves the regulation of the T cell immune response through the activation or suppression/inactivation of the CD28 pathway. Induction of activated T cell lymphokine production occurs upon stimulatory binding of the CD28 surface receptor molecule, even in the presence of conventional immunosuppressants. Inhibition of CD28 receptor binding to an appropriate stimulatory ligand or inactivation of the CD28 signal transduction pathway through other means down-regulates CD28-pathway related T cell lymphokine production and its resulting effects.

<DESCRIPTION>
Murine hybridoma cell line 9.3 has been deposited with the American Type
Culture Collection in Rockville, MD, in compliance with the provisions of the Budapest
Treaty, and has been assigned ATCC Designation No. HB10271.The present invention generally relates to immunotherapy. More particularly,
the present invention relates to immunotherapy involving regulation of the CD28 T cell
surface molecule.Thymus derived lymphocytes, referred to as T cells, are important regulators
of in vivo immune responses. T cells are involved in cytotoxicity and delayed type
hypersensitivity (DTH), and provide helper functions for B lymphocyte antibody
production. In addition, T cells produce a variety of lymphokines which function as
immunomodulatory molecules, such as for example, interleukin-2 (IL-2), which can
facilitate the cell cycle progression of T cells; tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and
lymphotoxin (LT), cytokines shown to be involved in the lysis of tumor cells;
interferon-γ (IFN-γ), which displays a wide variety of anti-viral and anti-tumor effects; 
and IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which
function as multilineage hematopoietic factors.Current immunotherapeutic treatments for diseases such as cancer, acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and attending infections, involve the systemic
administration of lymphokines, such as IL-2 and IFN-γ, in an attempt to enhance the
immune response. However, such treatment results in non-specific augmentation of
the T cell-mediated immune response, since the lymphokines administered are not
specifically directed against activated T cells proximate to the site of infection or the
tumor. In addition, systemic infusions of these molecules in pharmacologic doses
leads to significant toxicity. Present therapies for immunodeficient or
immunodepressed patients also involve non-specific augmentation of the immune
system using concentrated γ-globulin preparations. The stimulation of the in vivo
secretion of immunomodulatory factors has not, until now, been considered a feasible
alternative due to the failure to appreciate the effects and/or mechanism and attending
benefits of such therapy.It would thus be desirable to provide a method of immunotherapy which
enhances the T cell-mediated immune response and which is directed specifically
toward T cells activated by an antigen produced by the targeted cell. It would further
be desirable to provide a method of immunotherapy which could take advantage of
the patient's natural immunospecificity. It
