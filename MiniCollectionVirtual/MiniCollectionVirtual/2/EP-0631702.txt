 comparators (114h, 114i, 114j...) coupled to the analog input line to generate a n-bit digital output signal. Each pair of these actual comparators are coupled, in parallel, to 2

 pseudocomparators (114j+1, 114j+2, 114j+3...) which provide values representing comparisons of the input signal value to respective reference values between the reference values used by the actual comparators. The output signals of each pair actual comparators are combined in respectively different proportions at each of the pseudocomparators. In this manner, the output signals of the actual comparators are averaged to produce the interstitial comparison values. In one embodiment of the invention, the ADC is implemented in BiCMOS technology with a bipolar differential input stage and a CMOS latching comparator. Signals are distributed from the actual comparators to the pseudocomparators via a pair of resistive ladder networks. In other embodiments of the invention the ADC is implemented in CMOS technology and the pseudocomparators use ratioed transistor widths and ratioed capacitors to proportionally divide the ouptut signals of the actual comparators in order to generate the interstitial ouput values. A final embodiment of the invention combines two averaging flash ADCs to form a novel subranging ADC.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is a flash-type analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
and, more particularly, a high-resolution flash-type ADC having only
2m comparators coupled to the analog input line but which produce n-bit
digital values, where m is an integer less than n.A typical flash ADC uses 2n-1 comparators to generate n-bit
digital values which represent an analog input signal sampled at
instants determined by its clock signal. For example, a typical 8-bit ADC
uses 28-1 = 255 comparators. A 10-bit ADC would use 210-1 = 1023
comparators. Each of these comparators is supplied with an analog
input signal and one of 2n-1 evenly spaced reference values.
Comparators having reference values which are less than the input
signal value provide a first logic state, for example logic-high, to a
decoder while comparators having reference values which are greater
than the input signal provide a second logic state, for example logic-low.
The decoder is a thermometer type or a priority encoder which
translates the 2n-1 logic values provided by the respective comparators
into an n-bit digital value.Thus, in a flash ADC, the input signal is coupled to each of the
2n-1 comparators. Each of which presents a load impedance to the input
signal. Even if the comparators are designed to have a relatively low
input impedance, the sum of the input impedances of all of the
comparators can create a significant load which must be driven by the
input signal. The relatively large input impedance of comparator
arrays having more than 255 comparators makes classic flash-type
ADCs impractical for digital values having more than 8 bits. This is
true whether the input impedance is resistive and capacitive, such as is
found in bipolar circuitry, or primarily capacitive such as is found in
metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) circuitry.In addition, relatively large flash ADCs are subject to integral and
differential linearity errors. Integral linearity errors usually occur
during high-speed operation when the current drawn by the input
comparators through the reference ladder network produces significant
additional potential drops across the reference resistors. When the
reference input ports of the comparators present significant capacitive
loads, the amount of current drawn, and thus, the potential drops
across the ladder network are proportional to the clock frequency. 
Differential linearity error is a measure of the error offset of the worst
comparator in the array. This type of error may be caused by
mismatched or faulty components in an individual
