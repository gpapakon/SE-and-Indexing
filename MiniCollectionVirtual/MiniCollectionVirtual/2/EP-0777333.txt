<ABSTRACT>
A phase lock loop includes a voltage 
controlled oscillator (VCO), a phase comparator 

for comparing the phases of the output of the 
VCO and a reference signal, a charge pump circuit, 

including a plurality of current sources, for 
supplying a control voltage by charging or 

discharging a capacitor based on the outputs of 
the current sources, and a current source 

controller for controlling the current output 
of the current sources by a n-bit current control 

signal. Charge current and discharge current 
by the charge pump circuit are controlled in n 

bits so that a rapid synchronization during 
lock-in and a low jitter after lock-in can be 

obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a PLL (phase locked loop) circuit, in
particular, to a power saving PLL circuit which includes a
charge pump circuit for effecting a rapid lock-in and a low
jitter.A conventional PLL circuit is known which includes a phase
comparator, a VCO (voltage controlled oscillator) and a charge
pump circuit etc. The PLL circuit is generally used in a
portable telephone system, a pager system, a frequency
synthesizer which multiplies an input frequency by n, a
frequency multiplier as used in a microprocessor, for example,
for generating an internal clock frequency above an external
clock frequency, or in a device which adjusts the timing of an
input/output signal.From US-A-5 233 314 (MCDERMOTT MARK W ET AL), 3.August 1993,
another phase-locked loop clock generator is known which
generates a clock signal having a frequency which is equal to
the frequency of an input clock signal.From US-A-5 362 990 (ALVAREZ JOSE ET AL), 20.April 1995, a
programmable charge pump circuit is known which outputs a
current dependent on several control signals.Fig.1 is a block diagram of a PLL circuit, showing an example
of the prior art. In the 
drawing, a conventional PLL circuit la includes
a reference frequency divider 2 which divides
an external reference frequency supplied from
a frequency generator (not illustrated), an
internal frequency divider 7 to which a VCO
output, to be described later, is input, a phase
comparator 3 which receives outputs from both
the frequency dividers 2 and 7 at respective
inputs thereof to effect a phase comparison, a
charge pump circuit 4a, responsive to a result
of comparison by the phase comparator 3, to
supply charge current or sink discharge current,
a low-pass filter (e.g. LPF) 5 which passes low
frequencies of an output from the charge pump
circuit 4a, and VCO 6 which responds to an output
from the filter 5 to supply a desired frequency
as an output signal through an output terminal
8 and also to the internal frequency divider 7.
To facilitate the understanding, the
description will be given to a conventional PLL
circuit la having a VCO in which an output
frequency is proportional to a control voltage
by a positive factor. However, the invention
is not limited the type of the PLL circuit.In the PLL circuit la, the phase comparator 
3 receives at a first input R the first output
from the reference frequency divider 2, which
divides the external reference frequency output
from the reference frequency generator, as
typified by a crystal oscillator of a
temperature
