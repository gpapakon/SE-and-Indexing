<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus and method for controlling 
damping force characteristics of each of shock absorbers 

independently of one another, the damping force 
coefficient for each shock absorber is controlled on the 

basis of so-called " sky hook " theory with respective 
sprung mass vertical velocities and relative velocities 

between the sprung mass and unsprung mass taken into 
consideration. The relative velocity detecting means is 

only installed on portions of the vehicle related to 
front left and right tire wheels. The road surface 

velocities on the front left and right tire wheels are 
calculated and the road surface velocities on the rear 

left and right tire wheels are calculated on the basis of 
the calculated front left and right wheel road surface 

velocities, a vehicular wheel base length, and a vehicle 
speed. Then, relative velocities between the sprung mass 

and unsprung mass related to the rear left and right tire 
wheels are calculated on the basis of the calculated rear 

left and right tire wheel road surface velocities and 
sprung mass vertical velocities related to the vicinities 

of the rear left and right tire wheels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus 
and method for independently controlling damping force 
coefficients of four tire wheel suspension units (shock 
absorbers) of an automotive vehicle. A Japanese Patent Application First Publication 
No. Showa 61-163011 exemplifies a vehicle suspension 
control apparatus. A suspension control apparatus disclosed in the 
above-identified Japanese Patent Application Publication 
includes shock absorbers (also called dampers hut herein 
after referred to as shock absorbers) generally located 
on respective four tire wheels. In the above-identified Japanese Patent 
Application, sprung mass (namely, vehicle body) vertical 
velocities and relative velocities between the sprung 
mass and an unsprung mass (namely, each of tire wheels 
and associated tire wheel suspension members) are 
detected. If both signs (an upward direction is plus and 
a downward direction is minus) of the sprung mass 
vertical velocity and relative velocity are mutually the 
same, the related shock absorber is controlled to provide 
a hard characteristic for the shock absorber damping 
characteristic. On the other hand, if both signs 
described above are mutually different, the related shock 
absorber is controlled to provide a soft characteristic 
for the shock absorber damping characteristic. Such a control method as described above is 
called suspension (shock absorber) control based on a " 
sky hook" theory and is carried out independently of the  
 
respective shock absorbers on the respective four tire 
wheels. JP 4191109 discloses an active suspension for a vehicle to 
improve riding comfort by detecting vibration input from 
each front wheel caused by the irregularities of the surface 
of a road. The time required for each rear wheel to 
come to the irregularities of the road is computed, based 
on vehicle speeds when the detected value exceeds a specified 
one. Each actuator of the rear wheels is controlled in 
such a way that the vibration of the rear wheels is relaxed. 
To achieve this purpose the active suspension according 
to JP 4191109 comprises a height sensor and a vertical-G-sensor 
at each front wheel. Each stroke and each 
vertical acceleration of the front wheels are detected by a 
rear wheel correction control section based on the signals 
of the height sensors and the vertical-G-sensors. The 
signals of these sensors are processed together with signals 
of the actual detected vehicle speed and the dimension 
of the stored wheel base so as to control the damping force
