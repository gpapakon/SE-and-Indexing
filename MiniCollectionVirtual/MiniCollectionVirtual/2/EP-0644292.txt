portions (24a, 24b, 24c) extending in the same horizontal plane and the steam 
injection nozzles (23) extend from the central portion (24a) of which the end 

which is adjacent to the steam injection zone sided end of the lower ironing 
shoe (3) is connected through the one outer longitudinal portion (24b) and the 

other outer lomgitudinal portion (24c) of the steam supply channel (24) to a 
steam inlet opening (28) in the lower ironing shoe (3). 
Device according to claim 4, characterised in that two coil springs (29), one 
inside the other, are arranged in each longitudinal portion (24a and 24b and 

24c) of the steam supply channel (24). 
Device according to claim 3, 4 or 5, characterised in that the two side walls 
(26) of the longitudinal groove (22) in the lower ironing shoe (3) each have a 

respective vertical transverse slot (27) between each pair of mutually adjacent 
steam injection nozzles (23). 
Device according to one of claims 2 to 6, characterised in that the lower 
ironing shoe (3) is provided in the air injection zone (L) with a vertical air 

injection slot (30) which extends in the direction of the length of the lower 
ironing shoe (3) and opens into the longitudinal groove (22) therein at the 

bottom (25) of the groove. 
Device according to claim 7, characterised in that the air injection slot (30) 
has an arcuately curved concave bottom (31) and is connected through a 

lateral air supply channel (32) to an air inlet opening (33) in the lower ironing 
shoe (3).  

 
Device according to claim 7 or 8, characterised in that the two side walls 
(26) of the longitudinal groove (22) in the lower ironing shoe (3) each have a 

respective gap (34) adjacent to the air injection slot (30). 
Device according to one of the foregoing claims, characterised in that the 
upper ironing shoe (4) is provided at that end which is adjacent to the air 

injection zone (L) of the lower ironing shoe (3) with a driving roller (14) and at 
the end which is adjacent to the steam injection zone (D) of the lower ironing 

shoe (3) with a tensioning roller (15) for the feed belt (13). 
Device according to claim 10, characterised in that the feed belt (13) 
comprises an aramid fibre fabric coated externally with silicone rubber and the
