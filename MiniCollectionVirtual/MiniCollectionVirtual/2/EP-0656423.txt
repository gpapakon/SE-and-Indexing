<ABSTRACT>
A method for determining the presence of an analyte in a 
fluid is described along with an apparatus specifically 

designed to carry out the method. The method involves 
taking a reflectance reading from one surface (15) of an 

inert porous matrix (11) impregnated with a reagent that 
will interact with the analyte to produce a light-absorbing 

reaction product when the fluid being analysed is applied to 
another surface (16) and migrates through the matrix to the 

surface being read. Reflectance measurements are made at 
two separate wavelengths in order to eliminate 

interferences, and a timing circuit is triggered by an 
initial decrease in reflectance by the wetting of the 

surface whose reflectance is being measured by the fluid 
which passes through the inert matrix. The method and 

apparatus are particularly suitable for the measurement of 
glucose levels in blood without requiring separation of red 

blood cells from serum or plasma.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a no-wipe test strip
for colorimetrically measuring the concentration
of glucose in whole blood.The quantification of chemical and
biochemical components in colored aqueous fluids, in
particular colored biological fluids such as whole
blood and urine and biological fluid derivatives such
as blood serum and blood plasma, is of ever-increasing
importance. Important applications exist in medical
diagnosis and treatment and in the quantification of
exposure to therapeutic drugs, intoxicants, hazardous
chemicals and the like. In some instances, the amounts
of materials being determined are either so miniscule--in
the range of a microgram or less per deciliter--or
so difficult to precisely determine that the apparatus
employed is complicated and useful only to skilled
laboratory personnel. In this case the results are
generally not available for some hours or days after
sampling. In other instances, there is often an
emphasis on the ability of lay operators to perform the
test routinely, quickly and reproducibly outside a
laboratory setting with rapid or immediate information
display.One common medical test is the measurement of
blood glucose levels by diabetics. Current teaching 
counsels diabetic patients to measure their blood
glucose level from two to seven times a day depending
on the nature and severity of their individual canes.
Based on the observed pattern in the measured glucose
levels the patient and physician together make
adjustments in diet, exercise and insulin intake to
better manage the disease. Clearly, this information
should be available to the patient immediately.Currently a method widely used in the United
States employs a test article of the type described in
U.S. Patent 3,298,789 issued January 17, 1967 to
Mast. In this method a sample of fresh, whole blood
(typically 20-40 µl) is placed on an ethylcellulose-coated
reagent pad containing an enzyme system having
glucose oxidase and peroxidase activity. The enzyme
system reacts with glucose and releases hydrogen
peroxide. The pad also contains an indicator which
reacts with the hydrogen peroxide in the presence of
peroxidase to give a color proportional in intensity to
the sample's glucose level.Another popular blood glucose test method
employs similar chemistry but in place of the
ethylcellulose-coated pad employs a water-resistant
film through which the enzymes and indicator are
dispersed. This type of system is disclosed in United
States Patent 3,630,957 issued December 28, 1971 to Rey
etal.In both

A no-wipe test strip, for measuring glucose in an
unmeasured sample of whole blood, said test strip being

adapted for use in a reflectance reading apparatus capable
of measuring reflectance at a first and a second wavelength,

said test strip comprising:

1) a porous, hydrophilic, polyamide matrix having, on
one side, a sample receiving surface adapted to receive said

whole blood sample and, on the other side, a testing surface
from which diffuse reflected light is measurable, wherein:


said testing surface is opposite to said sample
receiving surface;
said matrix is substantially reflective in the
absence of applied sample;
said matrix contains openings of a size sufficient to
allow the flow of a liquid portion of said whole

blood sample into the matrix from said sample

sample receiving surface to said testing surface, and
2) reagent means in said matrix for chemically reacting
with glucose to create a change in reflectance in the

presence of optically visible haemoglobin observable from
the testing surface, which change is indicative of the
