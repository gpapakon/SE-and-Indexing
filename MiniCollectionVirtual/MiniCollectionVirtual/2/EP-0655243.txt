<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel medicament for
treating sleep disorders in mammals.
Melatonin, represented by the structure below:
is named systematically as N-[2-(5-methoxy-3-indolyl)ethyl]acetamide.
Trivial names for the compound include
N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine and N-acetyl-O-methylserotonin.
Melatonin is a pineal gland hormone which has ovulation
inhibitory activity, Chu etal., Endocrinology, 75, 238 (1964),
as well as some activity against MCF-7 human breast cancer
cells, Blask etal. J. Neural. Transm. [Supp.], 21, 433 (1986)
and for the treatment of mammalian breast carcinoma, Blask et
al., Neuroendocrinol, Lett., 9(2), 63 (1987). Furthermore,
melatonin has been known to expedite recovery from "jet lag
syndrome", Arendt etal., Ergonomics, 30, 1379 (1987), to cause
sleep, Waldhauser etal., Psychopharmacology, 100, 222 (1990)
and to minimize disturbances in circadian rhythms of bodily
performance and function, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,600,723 and
5,242,941. Several melatonin analogues of the formula

wherein
R1 is hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl or C1-C4 alkoxy;R2 is hydrogen or C1-C4 alkyl;R3 is hydrogen or methyl;R4 is hydrogen, haloacetyl, C1-C5 alkanoyl, benzoyl or
benzoyl substituted with halo or methyl;R5 and R6 are individually hydrogen or halo; andR7 is hydrogen or C1-C4 alkyl;
   provided that when R2 is hydrogen, at least one of R5
and R6 is halo, have also been prepared and shown to possess
ovulation inhibition activity (see U.S. Patent Nos. 4997,845 and
4,614,807). Such analogues are also stated to be active in
treating hormonally dependent breast carcinomas in U.S. Patent
No. 5,196,435. However, none of these references discloses the
utility of such analogs in treating sleep disorders.Certain melatonin analogues having utility in
treating sleep disorders are disclosed in EP-A-0585206.Finally, European Patent Application 513,702 discloses
that melatonin and its analogues of the formula

wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different and are hydrogen or
halogen can be used in treating sleep disorders and in pre-anesthetic
medication. Again, such disclosure does not teach
the instantly claimed medicament for treating sleep disorders. It is an object of this invention to provide a new
medicament for treating sleep disorders by employing certain known
melatonin analogs. The instant medicament is believed to provide a
more efficacious (in terms of bioavailability, activity, side
effect profile and duration of action) means for treating such
disorders than previously known. Further, the melatonin
