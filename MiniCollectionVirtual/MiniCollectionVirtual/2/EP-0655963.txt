<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a mobile centrifugal blasting machine which can be moved in a working direction over areas (4) to be sprayed. It has two spinners (7, 8) arranged side-by-side transversely to the working direction which, during operation, generate a jet of particles (43, 44) directed towards an area (4) to be sprayed. This produces in the impact region (33) of the area (4) a central jet region (49) sprayed by the peripheral jet regions (47, 47') of both particle jets (43, 44) directed towards each other, thus giving a very uniform spray pattern over the area (4).

Mobile centrifugal blast cleaning machine movable across 
surfaces to be cleaned in one operating direction (5) while 

blasting particles accelerated by rotating impellers (7, 8) are 
thrown towards the surface (4) to be cleaned and hit it in an 

impact zone (33), with two impellers (7, 8) located next to each 
other at right angles to the operating direction (5) to produce 

a particle stream (43, 44) directed towards the surface (4) to 
be cleaned during operation, characterized in that the two adjacent 

particle streams (43, 44) merge laterally with their adjacent 
stream margin areas (47, 47') on reaching the impact zone 

(33) or earlier, overlapping to form a combined stream resulting 
in a central blasting area (49) jointly blasted by the two stream 

margin areas (47, 47') in the impact zone (33), where the blasting 
intensity is at least substantially equal to that produced 

in the stream main area (52, 53) of the two particle streams (43, 
44) adjacent to the respective stream margin area (47, 47'). 
Centrifugal blast cleaning machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the two impellers (7, 8) are located next 

to each other at a lateral distance at right angles to the operating 
direction (5). 
Centrifugal blast cleaning machine according to Claim 1 or 
2, characterized in that the two impellers (7, 8) rotate in 

opposite directions (38, 39) during operation. 
Centrifugal blast cleaning machine according to any of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the axes of rotation (12, 

13) of the two impellers (7, 8) extend in parallel and spaced 
axial planes (36, 37), being preferably inclined relative to the 

surface (4) to be cleaned.  
 
Centrifugal blast cleaning machine according to any of 
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the impact zone (33) is 

divided into three blasting zones (49, 50, 51) immediately adjacent 
to or merging into each other at right angles to the 

operating direction (5) by the particle streams (43, 44), these 
being a central blasting area (49) processed by the two adjacent 

and overlapping stream margin areas (47, 47') and two outer 
blasting areas (50, 51) processed by the remaining part of the 

two particle streams (43, 44) and flanking the central blasting 
area (49). 
Centrifugal blast cleaning machine according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that the outer blasting areas (50, 51) of the 

impact zone (33) are exclusively subjected to direct blasting by 
the stream main areas (52, 53) of the particle streams (43, 44) 

producing a greater blasting intensity. 
Centrifugal blast cleaning machine according to any of 
Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that means (55) are provided to 

prevent outer stream margin areas (54, 54') generated at opposing 
outer ends of the two particle streams (43, 44) and having a 

lower blasting intensity than the stream main areas (52, 53) from 
hitting the surface (4) to be processed outside the blasting 

areas (50, 51) generated by the stream main areas (52, 53), 
expediently diverting at least the major part to the blasting 

area (50, 51) directly blasted by the associated stream main area 
(52, 53). 
Centrifugal blast cleaning machine according to any of 
Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that blanking devices (55) are 

provided in the path of outer stream margin areas (54, 54') generated 
at opposing outer ends of the two particle streams (43, 

44) and having a lower blasting intensity than the stream main 
areas (52, 53) to blank the outer stream margin areas (54, 54') 

from the associated particle stream (43, 44), preventing the 
generation of a marginal blasting zone (56) produced by them 

alone on the surface (4) to be cleaned.  
 
Centrifugal blast cleaning machine according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that the blanking devices (55) are at least 

partially designed as reflecting devices (59) diverting the 
blanked outer stream margin area (54, 54') at least partially 

towards the outer blasting area (50, 51) processed by the associated 
stream main area (52, 53). 
Centrifugal blast cleaning machine according to Claim 8 or 
9, characterized in that the blanking devices (55) are represented 

by housing side walls (24) bordering a duct (25) for the particle 
streams (43, 44).
