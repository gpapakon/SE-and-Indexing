<ABSTRACT>
Certain perylene-3,4,:9,10-tetracarboxylic monoanhydride monoimides are condensed with primary diamines or with imidazoles. This produces amidine-imides of the formula I 
<

>
 where for example R1 is mono-hexylheptyl, R2 to R5 are each H and A is 1,2-phenylene. Compounds of the formula I are highly light-fast dyes which strongly fluoresce in solution, their fluorescence being bathochromically shifted compared with the bisimides (perylene dyes). The peryleneamidineimides of the invention are suitable for example for use as colorants for the mass coloration of macromolecular organic material, as fluorescent dyes or as photoconductive substances.
