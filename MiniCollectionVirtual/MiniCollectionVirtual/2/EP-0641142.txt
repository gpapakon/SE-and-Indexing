<ABSTRACT>
A loudspeaker assembly comprises a cabinet having top, bottom and side walls, a rear wall 
and a front baffle. A tweeter (10) and woofer (12) are mounted on the front baffle and 

connected to a crossover and filter unit. A flared vent pipe (64) is mounted in a port (62) 
in the rear wall extending into the cabinet. The vent pipe is coaxial with the tweeter and 

spaced from the tweeter such that the air gap (68) between the pipe and tweeter behaves as 
if it were a part of the vent pipe, increasing the acoustic length of the pipe, improving the 

low-frequency response of the assembly and reducing port noise.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to loudspeakers and in particular to vented enclosure loudspeakers 
having a vent pipe. Vented enclosure loudspeakers are well known. It is fundamental to baffle loudspeakers to 
prevent sound energy radiating from the rear of the loudspeaker to interfere destructively 
with the sound energy radiating from the front of the loudspeaker, particularly at lower 
frequencies. The baffle also provides a passive radiating surface in addition to the 
loudspeaker. Many loudspeakers are mounted in completely closed enclosures which 
attempt to provide an infinite baffle and provide a finite air volume behind the loudspeaker. 
Vented enclosure loudspeakers known as Bass-reflex or Helmholtz resonators include a port 
in the enclosure. The size and spacing port is chosen, in combination with the size of the 
enclosure and the resonance of the loudspeaker to delay the rear wave-front from the 
loudspeaker so that it interferes constructively with the forward wave-front, broadening and 
reinforcing the low-frequency response. It is also well known to use a vent pipe rather than a simple vent aperture to increase low-frequency 
response. The vent pipe, which extends into the enclosure, acts as an inductor, 
having a considerably greater inductance than a vent opening of the same diameter. This 
enables the volume of the enclosure, or cabinet to be reduced whilst maintaining the low-frequency 
response. Reduction in cabinet size is of particular importance to the Hi-fi industry as loudspeaker 
cabinets with good low-frequency responses are large items. As most loudspeakers are used 
in the domestic environment, cabinet size is often an important consideration when 
purchasing loudspeakers. There exists, therefore, a need to produce a loudspeaker which has a small cabinet but 
which does not sacrifice low-frequency response.  We have appreciated that under some circumstances a vent pipe behaves as if it is longer 
than its actual physical length. The invention resides in this realisation and its incorporation 
into a loudspeaker. More specifically, the invention is defined in the independent claim to which reference 
should be made. A loudspeaker embodying the invention has the advantage that a low-frequency response 
may be obtained for a given cabinet size that hitherto was only obtainable from a larger 
cabinet size. Preferred and advantageous features of the invention are set out in the dependent claims. A second aspect of the invention provides a mesh grille for a high frequency loudspeaker,

<CLAIMS>
A loudspeaker assembly comprising a tweeter and a woofer mounted in a vented 
cabinet, and a vent pipe extending from a port in the cabinet into the cabinet, the vent pipe 

being arranged with respect to the rear of the tweeter such that the effective acoustical 
length of the vent pipe is greater than its physical length. 
A loudspeaker assembly according to claim 1, wherein the vent pipe is aligned with 
the tweeter. 
A loudspeaker assembly according to claim 2, wherein the vent pipe is coaxial with 
the tweeter. 
A loudspeaker assembly according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the distance between 
the innermost end of the vent pipe and the rear of the tweeter is a fraction of the diameter 

of the vent pipe. 
A loudspeaker assembly according to any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the cross-sectional 
area of the innermost end of the vent pipe is approximately half the cross-sectional 

area of the rear of the tweeter. 
A loudspeaker assembly according to any preceding claim, wherein the port is in 
the rear face of the cabinet opposite the tweeter. 
A loudspeaker assembly according to any preceding claim, comprising a 
foraminous grille arranged over the front of the tweeter. 
A loudspeaker assembly according to claim 6, wherein the grille comprises a solid 
outer annulus and a domed foraminous central portion. 
A loudspeaker assembly according to any preceding claim, wherein acoustic foam 
is arranged in the cabinet to reduce standing waves within the vent pipe.
