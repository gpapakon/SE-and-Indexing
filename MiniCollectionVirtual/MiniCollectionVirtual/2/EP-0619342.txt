<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an aqueous dispersed resin 
composition ready to undergo crosslinking at room temperature 
on evaporation of water without any special means, such as 
heat, ultraviolet rays or radiation to provide a glossy film 
excellent in water resistance, solvent resistance and adhesion 
to a substrate. The composition of the present invention is 
useful as coating compounds for various substrates, such as 
wood, metal, paper, plastics and slate, printing inks, 
adhesives and textile assistants. Having excellent resistance 
to whitening on contact with water, the composition is 
particularly advantageous as a binder for stone finishing 
compounds using fine color stone particles. Aqueous resin dispersions are widely employed as 
coatings, adhesives and textile assistants. From the 
standpoint of environmental conservation and workability, 
aqueous resin dispersions have been replacing solvent-type 
resin compositions. However, containing polymers having a molecular weight 
as high as 500,000 to 1,000,000 in a particulate form, the 
conventional aqueous resin dispersions have insufficient 
fluidity for obtaining sufficient penetrability into a 
substrate and sufficient adhesion to a substrate.  
 
Additionally, a coating film having a smooth surface cannot be 
obtained. In order to overcome these disadvantages, reduction of 
resin particles in size to prepare a so-called microemulsion or 
addition of a water-soluble resin has been attempted. However, 
reduction of dispersed particle size of an emulsion requires a 
large quantity of an emulsifying agent, which leads to 
reduction of the water resistance of the resulting film. 
Addition of a water-soluble resin also results in reduction in 
water resistance of a film to an impractical level. An aqueous dispersion of a carbonyl-containing 
copolymer resin which contains a hydrazine derivative is known 
to provide a film having excellent water resistance, solvent 
resistance and hardness (see U.S. Patents 4,267,091, 4,210,565, 
5,208,282 and 4,959,428 and JP-B-1-13501 (the term "JP-B" as 
used herein means an "examined published Japanese patent 
application")). Nevertheless, the proposed aqueous resin 
dispersion is still inferior in adhesion to a substrate and 
surface smoothness of a film because the polymer exists in a 
particulate form. An object of the present invention is to provide an 
aqueous dispersed resin composition which provides a film 
excellent in water resistance, adhesion to a substrate, surface 
smoothness, gloss, and
