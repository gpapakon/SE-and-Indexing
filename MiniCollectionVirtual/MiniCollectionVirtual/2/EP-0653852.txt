<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical space
communication apparatus for converting an optical
signal modulated by a transmission signal into a beam
of light and propagating the beam of light through the
atmosphere to thereby effect communication between
remote points.Generally, in communications utilizing optical
signals, high-speed transmission of a large volume of
information is possible and particularly, optical space
communication using free space as a transmission path
has an advantage that it abounds in portability as
compared with wire communication as by optical fiber
and its communication paths can be simply set up. In
communication apparatuses according to the prior art,
in order to improve the reliability of optical space
communications, the correction, i.e., auto tracking, of
the angle of a beam of light in the direction of
emergence thereof is effected so that optical signals
may not come off the apparatus.Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings shows the
construction of an example of the prior art which is an
optical space communication apparatus having the 
tracking function. On an optical path behind a lens 1
for transmission/reception, there are disposed a lens 2
and a movable mirror 3, and two actuators 4 and 5 for
changing the angle of the movable mirror 3 are mounted
on the movable mirror 3. These actuators 4 and 5 are
adapted to be driven by the output of a tracking
control circuit 6. On an optical path downwardly
extending from the movable mirror 3, there are disposed
a polarizing beam splitter 7 transmitting therethrough
a polarized plane component parallel to the plane of
the drawing sheet and reflecting a polarized plane
component perpendicular to the plane of the drawing
sheet by a cemented surface 7a, a lens 8, and a light
emitting element 9 comprising a semiconductor laser or
the like, and the outputs of an amplifier 10 and a
transmission signal input end 11 are successively
connected to the light emitting element 9.On the other hand, on the optical path in the
direction of reflection of the polarizing beam splitter
7, there are disposed a beam dividing mirror 12, a lens
13 and a light receiving element 14 having four light
receiving elements 14a - 14d as shown in Figure 2 of
the accompanying drawings. The output of the light
receiving element 14 is connected to the tracking
control circuit 6. On the optical path in the
direction of reflection of the beam dividing mirror 12,
there are disposed a lens 15 and a light receiving 
element 17 comprising an avalanche photodiode, a PIN
