<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes and 
apparatuses for starting up and shutting down membrane 
gas separation systems comprising at least one gas 
separation membrane module and at least one membrane 
dryer module. Permeable membrane process and systems have been 
increasingly employed in gas separation operations. In 
such operations, a gas mixture is fed into the 
nonpermeate side of at least one gas separation 
membrane module under pressure. Upon contacting the 
surface of the membrane in the nonpermeate side of at 
least one gas separation membrane module, a more 
readily permeable component of the gas mixture passes 
or permeates through the membrane. The resulting 
permeated gas component is recovered or removed from 
the permeate side of the gas separation membrane module 
while the remaining unpermeated gas component is 
removed or recovered from the nonpermeate side of the 
gas separation membrane module. Commonly, these gas 
separation processes and systems are started up by 
passing and venting a compressed gas stream into and 
from the nonpermeate side of at least one gas 
separation membrane module until the desired steady 
state operating pressure, temperature and product 
purity are reached. The gas mixture fed to the gas separation membrane 
module, however, may contain a substantial amount of 
moisture and may cause corrosion and condensation in  
 
instrumentation, piping, pneumatic tools, ventilators 
and other equipment associated with the gas separation 
membrane module. In certain intances, it may also lead 
to inferior performance of the gas separation membrane 
module and/or other equipement, such as adsorption 
traps. To prevent such problems, a membrane dryer 
module is employed to provide a dry gas to the gas 
separation membrane module. Many of these arrangements 
use waste permeate gas stream from the permeate side of 
the gas separation membrane module to purge the 
permeate side of the membrane dryer module during 
steady state operations. European patent application 
0430304, U.S. Patent 5,169,412 and U.S. Patent 
4,933,070, for example, describe steady state operation 
of an air separation system with a membrane dryer 
module. Conventional membrane dryer module start-up 
methods include feeding a compressed gas into the 
nonpermeate side of a membrane dryer module and using 
at least a portion of the resulting product from the 
non-permeate side to purge the permeate side of the 
membrane dryer module. U.S. Patent 5,131,929 describes 
a startup method for a
