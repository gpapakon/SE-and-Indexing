<ABSTRACT>
A release device for an air cushion or thermal insulation barrier of a double or multi-glazed glass unit comprises interfitting first and second members (2, 4) which are movable relative to one another, the first member (2) having associated therewith a pin or striker (12) which is movable with the first member (2) from an inoperative position to an operative position to penetrate one or more glass panels of the unit, the device including means (16) to enable release of an air cushion or thermal insulation barrier of said glazed unit. The device, which may include one or more springs (14), may be mounted on support structure for movement from an inoperative position to an operative position, and means will be included in said device to limit the relative movement of said first and second members (2, 4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a release device for a multi 
glaze air cushion or thermal insulation barrier. In the field of double or multi glazed glass units for 
doors and windows, the space(s) between the panes of glass 
form(s) air cushion(s) or thermal insulation barrier(s), 
and it is these air cushions or barriers which makes the 
breakage of the glass extremely difficult and in many 
cases impossible. Whilst this is very useful and more than 
advantageous to prevent forced entry through a double or 
multi glazed unit, the very same air cushion or thermal 
insulation barrier constitutes a real hazard should it be 
necessary for a person to make a hurried exit - via the 
window - from a room fitted with a double or multi glazed 
unit. In such circumstances, for example in the case of 
fire, it is virtually impossible for the person to break 
the glass and leave via the window in the event that any 
other exits are unusable. The type of hazard related above is lessened to some 
degree when the window has an opening sash of sufficient 
dimensions and suitably positioned to enable exit therethrough, 
but the possibility of a necessarily hurried exit 
is not precluded and it is unlikely that such a hurried 
exit would be possible through such a restricted opening.  
 In most instances, double or multi glazed windows are 
sealed directly into a frame without an opening sash, and 
even where an opening sash is provided, the dimensions of 
such a sash are likely to be too small to enable a hurried 
exit to take place, or there may be window accessories that 
decrease the actual opening dimensions available or that 
create protrusions or obstacles constituting a danger for a 
person to make a hurried exit. The present invention seeks to provide means whereby the 
air cushion or thermal insulation barrier between the panes 
of glass of a double or multi glazed glass unit may be 
released so as to enable said panes of glass to be broken. According to the present invention there is provided a 
release device for an air cushion or thermal insulation 
barrier of a double or multi glazed glass unit, said 
release device comprising interfitting first and second 
members which are movable relative to one another, said 
first member having associated therewith a pin or striker 
which is adapted to move with said first member relative to 
said second member from a first inoperative position to a 
second operative position so as to penetrate a glass panel 
of said unit, such a device is known from EP-A-0237585.

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A release device for an air cushion or thermal 
insulation barrier of a double or multi glazed glass unit, 

said release device comprising interfitting first and 
second members (2,4) which are movable relative to one 

another, said first member (2) having associated therewith 
a pin or striker (12) which is adapted to move with said 

first member (2) relative to said second member (4) from a 
first inoperative position to a second operative position 

so as to penetrate a glass panel of said unit, 
characterised in that said device includes means (16) to 

enable release of an air cushion or thermal insulation 
barrier of said glazed unit, said means comprising one 

through bore or aperture. 
A release device according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that said pin or striker (12) is carried by and 

projects from a carrier plate (8) which is secured to said 
first member (2) so as to be movable with said first member 

(2) upon movement thereof relative to said second 
member (4). 
A release device according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that said second member (4) has a through  

 
bore (6) therein to enable passage of a leading end of 

said pin or striker (12) therethrough upon movement of said 
first member (2) relative to said second member (4). 
A release device according to any of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that said device includes at least one 

spring. 
A release device according to any of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that said first member (2) and said 

second member (4) include flanges (2A, 4A) to limit the 
relative movement of said first and second members (2,4). 
A release device according to any of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that said carrier plate (8) includes the 

means to enable the release of the air cushion or thermal 
insulation barrier, said means comprising at lease one 

through-bore or aperture. 
A release device according to Claim 6, characterised 
in that said carrier plate (8) includes two through bores 

or apertures (16). 
A release device according to any of Claims 1 to 7,  
 

characterised in that said pin or striker (12) has a 
pointed leading end (12A). 
A release device according to any of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that said device includes a decorative 

mushroom head (24) and in that said second member (4) is 
carried by a larger base member (22), said second member 

(4) being adhesively secured to said base member (22). 
A release device according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that said carrier plate (32) is movable relative to said 

first and second members of said device. 
A release device according to any of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that said device is mounted on an arm (54) 

which is pivotal relative to a support structure (58) to 
enable the device to be moved from an inoperative position 

to an operative position.
