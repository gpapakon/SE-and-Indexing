<ABSTRACT>
Automatic gear-change device including, within a casing (10, 110) a hydrokinetic (constant-velocity) torque converter (2, 102), of which the output shaft or primary shaft (3, 103) of the device drives a secondary shaft (7, 8; 107) by means of several step down gears (5, 6; 105, 105', 106) and of an epicycloid gear train (11, 111) exhibiting first and second planet (sun) gears P1, P2 (12, 112; 13, 113) which are coaxial, a planet carrier (14, 114), long planet gears S1 (15, 115) meshing with the first planet wheel (sun gear) P1 (12, 112), short planet gears S2 (16, 116) themselves in engagement with the second planet wheel (sun gear) P2, (13, 113) and an outward annulus (17, 117), the device placed under the control of several clutches (18, 19, 20; 118, 119, 120) and of several immobilization means (23, 24; 123, 124), characterised in that the first and second planet wheel (sun gear) P1, P2 (12, 13; 112, 113) may respectively be connected to the primary shaft (3, 103) by a first and second clutch (18, 19; 118, 119) while the planet carrier PS (14, 114) can be connected to the primary shaft (3, 103) by a third clutch (20, 120).
