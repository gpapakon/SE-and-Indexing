<ABSTRACT>
In order to create adaptors and holding devices which can be coupled for a low-voltage installation system consisting of electrical, insulation-free conductors, fastening and holding devices for fastening the conductors in a fixed position, a low-voltage electrical power source which can be connected to the conductors and loads which can be attached to the conductors, the conductors having a flat rectangular cross-section and being held such that they are aligned at a distance from one another and are electrically insulated from one another, it is proposed that it be possible to couple the loads by means of adaptors (3) which consist of insulating material and have at least one, preferably two mutually parallel, insertion slots (4) for pushing onto the flat conductors (1), the adaptors (3) in each case having a magnetic contact (5) on opposite sides, which magnetic contact can be connected to a connecting conductor or cable to which an electrical load can be connected, and the flat conductors (1) consisting of material which can be magnetised, so that in the case of an adaptor (3) which is pushed onto the conductors (1), in each case one magnetic contact (5) rests against a conductor (1), which is located in the insertion slot (4) of the adaptor (3), such that contact is made and the position is secured.

Low-voltage installation system, comprising at least 
two bending-resistant, electrical, insulation-free 

conductors which can be laid in parallel with one 
another, attachment and mounting devices for the fixed 

attachment of the conductors, a low-voltage current 
source which can be connected to the conductors, and also 

loads, such as light fittings or the like, which are 
attachable at least indirectly to the conductors and are 

electrically connectable to the latter, wherein the 
conductors have shallow rectangular cross section and are 

mounted in a mutually aligned manner at a distance and 
are electrically insulated from one another, and wherein 

the conductors form a conductor assembly whose wide 
rectangular sides are mutually adjacent to one another, 

characterized in that the loads can be coupled by means 
of adapters (3) which are composed of insulating material 

and which have at least one, preferably two, mutually 
parallel insertion slots (4) for pushing onto the flat 

conductors (1), wherein the adapter (3) has a magnetic 

contact (5) in each case at opposite sides, which magnetic 
contact can be connected to a connecting conductor or 

cable to which an electrical load can be connected and 
the flat conductors (1) are composed of a magnetizable 

material so that, with adapter (3) pushed onto the 
conductors (1), a magnetic contact (5) is adjacent in 

each case in a contacting and position-securing manner to 
a conductor (1) situated in the insertion slot (4) of the 

adapter (3) .  
 
System according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the adapter (3) has two pot-type receiving parts made of 

insulating material (6) for appropriately shaped magnetic 
contacts (5), in particular of cylindrical shape, which 

are directed towards one another by means of the openings 
and between which, in particular, a spacer (7) is 

arranged which is composed of insulating material and 
which can be inserted between the flat conductors (1), 

wherein a conductor-thick slot (4) is formed in each case 
between the openings of the receiving parts (6) and the 

spacer (7), which conductor-thick slot is open on three 
sides and is closed only at one end by a wall part (8) 

composed of insulating material which joins the spacer 
(7) to the receiving parts (6), in that the receiving 

parts (6) have conductor inlet openings (9) in their 
wall, in particular in the wall region parallel to the 

wall part, and in that the bases (10) of the receiving 
parts (6) are penetrated by attachment means (11), in 

particular screws, by means of which the magnetic contacts 
(5) can be attached. 
System according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that, on the side remote from the insertion slot (4) a 

web (12) which has an attachment arrangement (13) for an 
electrical load with conductor passage opening (14) 

projects from the one receiving part (6), wherein the 
conductor passage openings (9) of the receiving parts (6) 

and the conductor passage opening (14) of the attachment 
arrangement (13) can be covered by a cap (15) detachably 

attached to the adapter (3).  
 
System according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that two parallel wall parts (16) which are 

formed onto the receiving parts (6) and the connecting 
wall (8) project from the web (12) and the covering cap 

(15) covers the cavity formed in this way. 
System according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
the covering cap (15) has the base part (10) of the 

receiving part (6) not having a web as an integral 
component. 
System according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the spacer (7) situated between the 

receiving parts (6) has a push-through opening (17) for 
a magnetic contact (5), which push-through opening is 

coaxially directed towards the receiving cavities of the 
receiving parts (6) and is at least of the same size in 

the internal clearance. 
System according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the mounting device for the fixed, 

preferably cover-side attachment of the flat conductors 
(1) comprises a spacer (2) which is composed of insulating 

material and which has on opposite sides receiving 
slots (19) which are open in the longitudinal extension 

direction of the conductors (1) for the conductors (1) 
and which is joined, optionally via an extension bar (20) 

or the like, to a wall-mounting or cover-mounting plate 
(21).
