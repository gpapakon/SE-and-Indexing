<ABSTRACT>
A zero-power sense amplifier for implementing a wide or 
multiple input NOR gate for receiving a product term of a 

group of array cells in a programmable logic device (PLD). 
In a sleep mode, or low power mode, the zero-power sense 

amplifier latches its previous state while drawing 
negligible power rather than returning to one particular 

state, such as a low state, as in previous devices, 
enabling recovery time to be reduced after entering an 

awake mode. The zero-power sense amplifier further reduces 
recovery time upon powering up from a sleep mode by 

maintaining the product term voltage close to a threshold 
input voltage during sleep mode while still drawing 

negligible power.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sense 
amplifiers used in a programmable logic device (PLD) to 
implement wide or multiple input NOR gates. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to circuitry 
for a zero-power sense amplifier responsive to a sleep 
mode signal to reduce power consumed by the zero-power 
sense amplifier during the sleep mode. Fig. 1 shows an array structure for a typical prior 
art programmable array logic (PAL) device, a type of PLD 
which utilizes a sense amplifier to implement a multiple 
input NOR gate. The PAL of Fig. 1 has six inputs I₀₋₅ and 
four outputs O₀₋₃. The inputs I₀₋₅ each have a true output 
104 and a complement output 106 forming rows connected 
to programmable array cells, such as 110, of 
programmable array cells 108. An array cell, such as 
cell 110, may be programmed to be connected or 
disconnected to an AND gate in the AND array 100. 
Groups of array cells connected to an AND gate in AND 
array 100, such as shown at 112, are called a product 
term. The AND array 100 is followed by an OR array 102 
to provide a sum of products term output. The OR array 
may be connected to an output logic macrocell 114 which 
is programmable to be either registered or 
combinatorial. Circuitry similar to that shown in Fig.  
 
1, including the output logic macrocell 114, is 
utilized on the AmPALCE22V10, a device manufactured by 
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Sense amplifiers are utilized by manufacturers to 
implement the AND gates in the AND array 110. The AND 
gates are implemented using multiple input NOR gates 
with true and complement row connections to array cells 
reversed internally. The sense amplifiers are utilized 
to implement the multiple input NOR gates to provide 
sufficient output voltage to the OR gate array 102 at 
high speed. Sense amplifiers convert a small voltage 
from the product term into a larger, rail to rail, 
voltage to supply to an OR gate. Fig. 2 shows components of a sense amplifier 200 
used to implement the multiple input NOR gate on a PLD, 
such as the AmPALCE22V10. The sense amplifier 200 of 
Fig. 2 is also shown connected to array cells 202, 
similar to array cells 108 of Fig. 1, to receive a 
single product term, such as 112 of Fig. 1. Array cells 
202 of Fig. 2 receive input signals from rows 1-3 and 
are connected to form a product term (PT) line 
connection to sense amplifier 200. The array cells have 
lines connected to form a product term ground (PTG) line 
connection to sense amplifier 200. In operation, the PT line will be
