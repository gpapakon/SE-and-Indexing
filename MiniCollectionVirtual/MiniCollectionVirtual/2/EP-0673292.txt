<ABSTRACT>
A base metal repair tape (11) includes a first layer (13) formed braze alloy bonded together with fibrillated polytetrafluoroethylene, a second layer (14) formed from powdered base metal bonded together by fibrillated polytetrafluoroethylene and a third layer (15) comprising a brazing alloy bonded together by fibrillated polytetrafluoroethylene. This is used to repair base metal by placing the layer (15) on the base metal and brazing the base metal powder so that the brazing alloy melts and diffuses into the base metal powder bonding it to the surface of the article. This permits the braze powder to be bonded to the base metal surface with minimal distance between the base powder particles. The number of alternating layers of base metal (22) and braze alloy (23) can be increased to increase the thickness of the repair. This can also be used to form small intricate parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
Metal parts, for example, those used in jet engines are generally
required to meet very precise tolerances. Damage to metal parts during use or
during machining where a part is overmachined can prevent the part from falling
within the set tolerances and require that the part be repaired or replaced. To
repair such damage, new metal must be brazed to the surface of the part.The new metal needs to have a composition similar to the base metal.
Thus, diffusion braze fillers are combined with powder base metal to provide a
composition which brazes to the base metal at a temperature lower than the
melting point or softening point of the base metal.Typically, this was done by forming a slurry which includes the
powdered base metal, powdered diffusion braze filler and a binder which could be,
for example, a methacrylate binder, an alginate binder or the like. These systems
provide acceptable results. However, well defined geometries needed for some
repairs were very difficult to obtain. Further, slurries such as these are difficult to use. The binder system
must be initially mixed. Then the precise amount of base metal and diffusion filler
must be combined. This has a very limited shelf life. It cannot be mass produced
for sale and subsequent use. It must be prepared by the actual user which creates
the potential problem of human error.Also, the boron typically used in the braze alloy could localize or
puddle on the surface of the part. This weakens the base metal and can destroy
the part. Slurries are also difficult to conform, resulting in poor ability for large
build-up repairs.Also, with oxygen sensitive alloys such as those that include titanium,
aluminum, hafnium, and chromium, heating above 800°F (426.67°C) can cause oxide
formation. These oxides are not normally reducible in brazing furnaces. Most
braze furnaces are designed to either operate in the vacuum or in a hydrogen
atmosphere. However, there is frequently a trace amount of oxygen remaining in
the furnace that can react with these metals. To avoid this problem, such alloys
containing these oxygen sensitive metals are nickel coated prior to base metal
repair. This nickel precoating is undesirable simply because it requires an extra
step or even two extra steps frequently requiring masking of portions that are not
to be nickel coated.US Patent 4194040 discloses a method of forming an
article comprising heating a composition containing about
1 to 15% by volume of PTFE and about 85 to 99% by volume of
particulate metals, intermetallic compounds,

<CLAIMS>
A method of repairing the surface of a superalloy part with a composite tape having
at least a first braze alloy layer comprising braze alloy powder held together by a binder,

the binder being polytetrafluoroethylene,
and a second superalloy layer bonded to the first layer, the second layer comprising

superalloy powder held together by a binder, the binder being polytetrafluoroethylene,
the method comprising placing the first layer on the surface of the part and

heating the part to a temperature effective to evaporate the binder and braze the superalloy powder to
the surface.
A method as claimed in Claim 1 further comprising maintaining the part at the
temperature for a period of 30 minutes to 3 hours.
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 comprising brazing the tape to the
base metal surface in a non-oxidizing environment like hydrogen or a vacuum.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the tape is
formed from plural superalloy layers alternating with plural braze alloy layers. 
A method as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3 wherein the base metal layer
is sandwiched between two braze alloy layers.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the binder is fibrillated
polytetrafluoroethylene.
A method as claimed in Claim 6 wherein the first layer comprises from
about 1 to about 6% fibrillated polytetrafluoroethylene and the second layer contains

from about 1 to about 6% fibrillated polytetrafluoroethylene.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the ratio of base metal powder to
braze alloy is from 0.1:1 to 1:0.1 by weight.
