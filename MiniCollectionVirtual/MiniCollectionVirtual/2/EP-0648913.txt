<ABSTRACT>
In order further to develop a security device for a roller shutter or rolling shutter door which is made from slats and can be wound up onto a shaft and unwound therefrom, in particular if the last slat of said shutter or door is provided with at least one laterally extensible securing bolt, such that tampering can be eliminated, the intention being for this to be achieved in a simple manner with cost-effective means and for the security device to be fitted on the roller shutter in a simple manner, it is proposed that the shaft (7) has a locking mechanism formed by a cam plate (21), arranged on at least one side of the shaft (7), and a laterally projecting safety finger (22) which interacts with said cam plate and is provided on the uppermost slat (2.1) close to the shaft, and by a locking lug (23) which is fixed to the framework and engages beneath the safety finger (22) when the roller shutter is closed, the cam plate (21) exhibiting a clearance (21.2) extending to the circumference of the shaft (7), and the uppermost slat (2.1) of the roller shutter (1) being fastened on the shaft (7) such that, when the roller shutter (1) is drawn up, the safety finger (22) is guided into the clearance (21.2) of the cam plate (21) and held there.

Locking device for a roller shutter (1) or door
composed of bars (2) which can be wound on to and off a

shaft (7), particularly when the last bar (2.2) thereof
is provided with at least one laterally extensible lock

bolt (15), with the bar (2.1) which is uppermost and
close to the shaft having a laterally projecting safety

finger (22) as well as a frame-fixed blocking nose (23)
which projects below the safety finger (22) when the

roller shutter is closed, characterized in that the shaft
(7) has locking means formed by a cam (21) fitted to at

least one side of the shaft (7) and the safety finger
(22) interacting with the latter, the cam (21) having a

recess (21.2) extending to the periphery of the shaft
(7), and the uppermost bar (2.1) of the roller shutter

(1) being fixed to the shaft (7) in such a way that the
safety finger (22) is guided into the recess (21.2) of

the cam (21) and held there when the roller shutter (1)
is pulled up.
Locking device as claimed in Claim 1, characterized
in that the cam (21) of the locking means is provided

with a sleeve (7.2) which can be introduced into or
placed on to the shaft (7), with a positive or friction-type

connection existing between the sleeve (7.2) and the
shaft (7).
Locking device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the locking means is provided on

that side of the shaft (7) which faces away from the
drive side.
Locking device as claimed in Claim 1, 2, to 3,
characterized in that the safety finger (22) is formed as

a pin inserted into the uppermost bar (2.1) of the roller
shutter (1) projecting in the longitudinal direction of

the bar. 
Locking device as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to
4, characterized in that for the purpose of fastening the

uppermost bar (2.1) of the roller shutter (1), at least
two connections are provided, whose length is matched

with the diameter of the shaft (7) in such a way that,
when the roller shutter (1) is wound up, the safety

finger (22) is drawn into the recess (21.2) of the cam
(21), the arc of contact being selected so that the

winding length corresponds to the angle formed by the
curve on the cam.
Locking device as claimed in Claim 5, characterized

in that flexible belts, preferably continuous roller
shutter belts, are provided as connections.
Locking device as claimed in Claim 5, characterized
in that flat spiral springs (9), preferably made from

stainless steel, are provided as connections.
Locking device as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to
7, characterized in that a stop sheet (23) is provided as

a blocking nose in the area of the bearing of the shaft
(7) allocated to the safety finger (22).
Locking device as claimed in Claim 8, characterized
in that the stop sheet (23) is mounted on the cover (11)

of a bearing box (10) in a height-adjustable manner, the
cover (11) preferably being provided with longitudinal

slots aligned in the direction of movement of the roller
shutter (1), which longitudinal slots interact with the

screw connection (24) of the stop sheet (23).
Locking device as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to
7, characterized in that the stop sheet (23) is provided

as a strip-like extension (26) of an insert (25)
insertable into the bearing box (10) or connection to the

box cover (11), the strip-like extension (26) being
capable of being cut to length. 
Locking device as claimed in Claim 8, 9 or 10,
characterized in that the height adjustment area of the

stop sheet (23) amounts to at least one half-width of a
bar (2) of the roller shutter (1) or of the roller door.
