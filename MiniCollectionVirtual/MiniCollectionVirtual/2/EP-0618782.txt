An examination couch adjustable for height and 
cantilever, used in a mobile manner for medical purposes for 

scinitgraphic tomography, comprising a pedestal (15), motor (16), 
patient support (13),
 
characterised by the fact that it permits movement of great 

amplitude of the patient support (13) and vertically by 
comprising: 


an intermediate carriage (14) 
means (18), activated by the motor (16), for moving the 
intermediate carriage (14) vertically by causing it slide in 

relation to the pedestal (15) 
a patient support (13) moving vertically along the 
intermediate carriage (14) 
a pulley (19), fixed to the intermediate carriage (14), 
supporting a chain (20) the ends (26) and (27) of which are fixed 

to the pedestal (15) and to the patient support (13) to enable 
the patient support (13) to be raised when the means (18) for 

moving the intermediate carriage (14) raises this carriage (14) 
and consequently the pulley (19) 
the pedestal (15) and the patient support (13) comprising 
runners (21) sliding along four vertical rails (22) fixed to the 

intermediate carriage (14), two on the pedestal (15) side and two 
on the patient support (13) side, in order to permit, firstly, 

the vertical movement of the intermediate carriage (14) in 
relation to the pedestal (15) and, secondly, that of the patient 

support (13) in relation to the intermediate carriage (14) 
rails (22) with a hexagonal cross section such that the 
runners (21) cooperate respectively with at least four sides of 

the hexagonal cross section to enable the patient support (13) 
and the intermediate carriage (14) to be raised in directions 

perpendicular to the sides of the hexagon so as to prevent the 
patient support (13) from tipping over. 
A couch according to claim 1, characterised by the fact 
that the means (18) for moving the intermediate carriage (14) 

comprises a screw (18) which raises the intermediate carriage 
(14).  

 
A couch according to either of claims 1 to 2, 

characterised by the fact that the means (18) for moving the 
intermediate carriage (14) comprises a worm screw (18) which 

raises the intermediate carriage (14) by turning in a nut (23) 
fixed to the lower part of the intermediate carriage (14). 
A couch according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised by the fact that the runners (21) comprise 

removable, interchangeable bearings (29) to reduce the clearance 
between the rails (22) and the runners (21). 
A couch according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised by the fact that the pulley (19) and the point of 

attachment (27) of the chain (20) to the patient support (13) are 
adjustable in height. 
A couch according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised by the fact that the attachment (26) of the chain 

(20) to the pedestal (15) is situated at a high position, near 
to the pulley (19), to shorten the length of the chain (20). 
A couch according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised by the fact that the patient support (13) is 

cantilever mounted in relation to the pedestal (15). 
A couch according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised by the fact that the intermediate carriage (14) and 

the patient support (13) are orientated so as to be raised, when 
there is no patient (12) on the patient support (13), on an axis 

(32) set at a slight angle to the vertical, so that they rise 
vertically when a patient (12) is lying on top, under the effect 

of his/her weight (30).
