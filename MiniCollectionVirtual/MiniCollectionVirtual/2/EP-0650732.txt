<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the manufacture of a medicine
comprising as an active ingredient a specific α-galactosylceramide.
More specifically, the present
invention relates to a marrow cell proliferation
accelerator having potent therapeutic effects on various
diseases caused by the damage of marrow cells.The present invention also relates to the manufacture of a
radioprotective agent which has a life-span-increasing
effect on those who have been exposed to a lethal dose of
radiation, and which is effective for prophylaxis and
remedy of side effects caused upon radiotherapy.The present invention further relates to the manufacture of a
therapeutic agent for thrombocytopenia, capable of
increasing the number of blood platelets or inhibiting a
reduction in number of blood platelets.It has been known that marrow cells are damaged and
their number is decreased by irradiation of a large dose
of radiation, or by administration of a large amount of
chemotherapeutic agent.Further, it is known that hypoplastic anemia,
osteomyelodysplasia and the like are diseases caused by a
functional disorder (including a decrease in the number)
or hypofunction of marrow cells. The marrow cells herein
refer to those cells which are present in bone marrow,
and include red blood cells, neutrophiles, eosinophils,
basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and various cells,
such as blood platelets, in various differentiated
stages.In order to overcome the damage of marrow cells,
which is a cause of the above-described conditions of
diseases or diseases, bone marrow transplantation or
administration of various hematopoietic factors has been 
attempted, and, in addition, the exploration of novel
marrow-cell-proliferating factors is now being made
energetically.As mentioned above, various diseases or conditions
of diseases are caused by the damage of marrow cells.
Since a decrease in the number of marrow cells is one of
the causes of the diseases, there is a high possibility
that a marrow-cell-proliferation-accelerating material
can ameliorate the above diseases or conditions of
diseases.α-ray, β-ray and γ-ray emitted from a radioactive
substance, or radiations such as artificially produced
potent X-ray, proton ray, neutron ray and electron beam
are indispensable for the treatment or diagnosis of
diseases such as cancer. However, when more than a
permissible dose of radiation is irradiated, or when
radiation is irradiated to normal tissues or organs in
the body upon treatment, the numbers of white blood
cells, red blood cells and the
