<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to olefin thermoplastic
elastomers and laminates thereof. More particularly, the
invention relates to olefin thermoplastic elastomers which
can be molded into articles of high scratch resistance and
relates to olefin thermoplastic elastomer laminates of high
scratch resistance which can be favorably used for
automobile exterior trim parts, etc.Vinyl chloride resins have been conventionally widely
used for side protection molds of automobiles. The vinyl
chloride resins are very suitable for such uses because
they are excellent in scratch resistance and available at a
low price. However, the vinyl chloride resins generate
harmful gas when burned, and hence there is involved a
problem of environmental pollution.By the way, olefin thermoplastic elastomers are used
widely for automobile parts, industrial machine parts,
electric and electronic parts, building materials, etc. as
elastomers suitable for saving energy or saving natural
resource type, particularly as replacements for vulcanized
rubbers, because they are lightweight and can be easily
recycled. Further, from the viewpoint of the protection of
earth's environment, the vinyl chloride resins which generate
harmful gas when burned have been recently replaced with
olefin thermoplastic elastomers which generate no harmful
gas.However, the molded articles produced from the
conventional olefin thermoplastic elastomers are inferior in
scratch resistance to the molded articles produced from the
vinyl chloride resins, and therefore, an improvement of the
scratch resistance has been eagerly desired for the olefin
thermoplastic elastomers.Furthermore it has long been known that conventional
olefin thermoplastic elastomers find application in laminate
structures. For example US 3,424,649 proposes dienemonovinylarene
block copolymer-polyolefin laminates, more
specifically a substrate layer of a normally solid polyolefin
which is tightly bound to a superficial layer comprising a
polystyrene-polybutadiene-polystyrene block copolymer.Under such circumstances as mentioned above, the
present inventors have earnestly studied olefin thermoplastic
elastomers having high scratch resistance and molded articles
thereof. As a result, they have found the following and
accomplished the present invention.
