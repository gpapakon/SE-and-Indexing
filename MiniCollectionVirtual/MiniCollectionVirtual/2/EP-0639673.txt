<ABSTRACT>
A support (1) comprises one or more support legs (2) pivotally 
connected to a first member (4) and one or more link members (6), each link 

member being pivotally connected adjacent one end (7) thereof to a support 
leg and adjacent the other end (9) thereof to a second member (8). The first 

member (4) is slidably located within the second member (8) so that the 
support legs (2) are movable between a first position in which the legs (2) 

extend from the first member (4) and the support can rest on the ground in 
a supporting disposition and a second position in which the legs (2) are 

disposed adjacent the first member (4). Movement of the legs (2) from the 
first to the second position is obtained by lifting the support from the 

ground. Movement of the legs from the second position to the first position 
is obtained by moving the second member (8) relative to the first member 

(4) towards the pivotal connections (3) of the legs (2) with the first member 
(4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a support and in particular to a 
collapsible support suitable for supporting a sign or other device. The 
invention has particular application in the field of road signs, traffic control 
barriers and the like. Collapsible supports for road signs are known. For example, 
EP0113596 discloses an apparatus for use as a traffic warning device 
comprising a central tube having a fixed lower hinge block to which link 
arms are pivotally connected. A number of support legs are pivotally 
connected at one end to the other end of the link arms. The other ends of 
the support legs are pivotally connected to an upper hinge block which is 
slidably supported on the central tube. In use, the support legs are moved 
into the open and closed position by sliding the upper hinge block down or 
up the central tube causing the lower end of the legs to move out from or 
in towards the central tube as the link arms pivot on the lower hinge block. Similar sliding collar constructions are known for various tripod stands 
such as are used on projector screens, music stands and the like. However such known stands suffer from a number of draw backs. In 
particular with these conventional support stands, one generally has to hold 
the sliding collar and often also the central tube to effect opening or closing 
of the stand. Usually such stands require a catch or the like to prevent the 
collar sliding when in the open position. Alternatively the collar can be made 
a close fit on the central tube so that it won't slide without an applied force. 
However both of these methods increase the difficulty of opening or closing  
 
the stand. These disadvantages can cause particular problems for temporary 
road signs and the like which usually have to be erected as speedily and 
easily as possible. Furthermore, with these conventional types of support 
stand, the weight to be supported must generally be applied to the central 
tube the base of which is supported on the ground. Thus the support legs 
do not carry the bulk of the weight and merely act as stabilisers. If the bulk 
weight were to be applied to the support legs and collar, the catch or collar 
would tend to give so that the collar would tend to slide on the central tube 
thereby causing the support legs to spread or open too far thus reducing the 
effect of the support. Similarly applying the bulk weight to the legs and 
collar would increase the strain placed on the legs and collar. A further 
disadvantage of stands such as that disclosed in

<CLAIMS>
A support (1) comprising one or more support legs (2) pivotally 
connected (3) to a first member (4) and one or more link members (6), each 

link member being pivotally connected adjacent one end (7) thereof to a 
support leg and adjacent the other end (9) thereof to a second member (8) 

characterised in that said first member (4) is slidably located within said 
second member (8) so that the support legs (2) are movable between a first 

position in which the legs (2) extend from the first member (4) and the 
support can rest on the ground in a supporting disposition and a second 

position in which the legs (2) are disposed adjacent the first member (4), 
movement of the legs (2) from the first position to the second position being 

obtained by lifting the support from the ground and movement of the legs 
from the second position to the first position being obtained by moving the 

second member (8) relative to the first member (4) towards the pivotal 
connections (3) of the legs (2) with the first member (4). 
A support as claimed in claim 1 wherein relative movement of the 
first and second members from the second to the first position is obtained 

by applying a downward force to the first member. 
A support as claimed in any preceding claim wherein movement 
of the legs from the first to the second position is obtained by applying an 

upward force to any of the support legs, the first member or the pivotal 
connection between said legs and first member. 
A support as claimed in any preceding claim wherein when the 
support is in the second position the pivotal connections between the link 

 
members and the support legs are disposed substantially between the pivotal 

connections between the link members and the second member and the 
pivotal connections between the support legs and the first member. 
A support as claimed in any preceding claim wherein when the 
support is in the first position or any position between the first and second 

positions a line taken perpendicularly from the first or second member to the 
pivotal connections between the link members and the support legs 

intersects the axis of the first and second members at a location between 

the pivotal connections of the link members with the second member and 
the pivotal connections of the support legs with the first member. 
A support as claimed in any preceding claim wherein part of the 
first member extends partially or wholly within the second member. 
A support as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the second 
member acts as a guide for the first member. 
A support as claimed in any preceding claim wherein one or more 
extension means (42,44,48) is provided on the support to facilitate support 

of a sign or other device. 
A support as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the support 
legs are pivotally connected to the first member by a hinge means (3) 

secured to or formed as an integral part of the first member. 
A support as claimed in any preceding claim wherein ballast 
weights are located on or within one or more of the support legs, the first 

member or the second member.
