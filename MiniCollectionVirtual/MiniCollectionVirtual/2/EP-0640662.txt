<ABSTRACT>
The organopolysiloxane mixture for abhesive (adhesive-repellent) coating of paper comprises branched organopolysiloxanes containing unsaturated terminal groups and linear hydropolysiloxanes, where the hydropolysiloxane molecules are at least twice as long as the linear sections of the branched organopolysiloxanes.

<CLAIMS>
Organopolysiloxane compositions which can be crosslinked
by addition, consisting of


a) a branched organopolysiloxane having unsaturated
hydrocarbon groups,


wherein at least 90% of the organo groups are
methyl groups,
the molecular weight of which is on average from
9,000 to 60,000,
wherein the ratio of the number of diorganosiloxy
units (D-units) to the number of branch points is

on average between 15 and 40, and
wherein at least one triorganosiloxy unit (M-unit)
and at most half of all the M-units are free of

unsaturated radicals, the remaining M-units each
have only one unsaturated radical and the content

of unsaturated radicals is from 0.2 to 1 mmol/g,
and
b) a linear methylhydrogenpolysiloxane,

wherein the number of siloxy units per mole is
greater than the ratio of the number of D-units to

the number of branch points of component a), and
wherein at least half of the difunctional siloxy
units (D-units) have hydrogen atoms directly

bonded to silicon, and
wherein the components a) and b) are present in a
relative proportion such that the ratio of the 

number of SiH groups of component b) to the number
of unsaturated hydrocarbon groups of component a)

is between 1.5 and 3.5, and
c) an effective amount of a platinum catalyst,

and optionally

d) customary additives and auxiliary substances which do
not directly participate in the polyaddition reaction

in amounts less than 5% by weight, calculated in
respect of the total mixture.
A mixture according to claim 1, wherein the branch
points of component a) consist of trifunctional mono-organosiloxy

units (T-units) up to one half of which may
be substituted by tetrafunctional siloxy groups (Q-units),

each Q-unit being counted as 2 branch points in
the determination of the ratio of branch points to D-units.
A mixture according to claims 1 or 2, wherein the
unsaturated hydrocarbon groups are C
2
 to C
8
 alkenyl
groups.
A mixture according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein
the number of organosiloxy groups of component b) is at

most double the ratio of the number of D-units to the
number of branch points of component a).
A mixture according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein
component a) has at least 12 T-units per molecule.
Use of the mixture according to any one of claims 1 to 5
for the preparation of adhesive-repellent coatings.
