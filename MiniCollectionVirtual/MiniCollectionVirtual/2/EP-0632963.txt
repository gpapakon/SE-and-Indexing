<ABSTRACT>
A process for manufacturing low fat sausages, in which a meat batter is 
prepared which consists of meat, added fat, ice and nitrite curing salt in such 

proportions that it has a fat content of from 1 to 20%, which comprises 
chopping ground meat, while adding the ice, salt and phosphate, at a 

temperature maintained between -2°C and 10°C by the addition of liquid 
nitrogen for 2 to 10 min, further chopping, while adding the fat, at a temperature 

maintained between 1°C and 10°C by the addition of liquid nitrogen for up to 10 
min, chopping to a temperature between 12°C and 15°C, stuffing, redning and 

heating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a process for manufacturing low fat sausages
which comprises preparing a meat batter comprising meat, added fat, ice and
nitrite curing salt in such proportions that it has a fat content of from 1 to 20%.DE 3344521 discloses a process and an apparatus comprising a cutter for the
manufacture of meat batter in which liquid nitrogen is intermittently sprayed onto
the rotating blades of the cutter to counteract the heat produced by operating
friction. This process appears to have a positive influence on the organoleptical
properties, the aspect and the keeping properties of the otherwise traditional
sausages made of this batter. This patent does not suggest that this process
and apparatus could be useful for the manufacture of low fat sausages.Traditional finely comminuted cooked meat sausage products comprises about
40 to 50% lean meat, 25 to 35% added fat and 20 to 30% water. A simple
approach for the fat reduction is the change of formulation of sausage products.
Instead of added fat one can use more meat and ice. However, such a reduction
of the amount of added fat may lessen the water binding in the sausage product
by way of a strong shrinkage of protein matrices during heat treatment due to a
poor distribution of fat particles in these matrices, an increased water content
due to the substitution of meat and water for fat, and a lower ionic strength in the
aqueous phase.A known way for recovering a good water binding in such sausage products is to
use fat substitutes or binders such as protein or carbohydrate based substitutes
or synthetic compounds. However fat substitutes are not always as much
appreciated as natural fats and binders can affect the organoleptical properties
of the sausage products. EP-A-0279883 discloses a process for manufacturing no salt, low fat sausages
which comprises adding soy isolate or milk protein as a binder to the meat-batter
for recovering a good water binding in these sausages.FOOD TECHNOLOGY vol. 46, no 4, 1992, CHICAGO, pages 100-108,
J. GIESE "DEVELOPING LOW-FAT MEAT PRODUCTS" discloses a process
for manufacturing low fat sausages which comprises replacing a part of the fat by
soy proteins or a water-gum suspension.DE-A-3608859 discloses a process for producing a meat batter for the
manufacture of traditional full fat sausage products which comprises adding a first
part of water and ice to the meat and fat to be chopped in a meat cutter, chopping
the mixture up to a controlled temperature, adding a remaining part of water and
ice and

<CLAIMS>
A process for manufacturing low fat sausages, in which a meat batter is
prepared which consists of meat, added fat, ice and nitrite curing salt in such

proportions that it has a fat content of from 1 to 20% by total weight of the batter which
comprises:


grinding comminuted meat,
chopping the ground meat, while adding the ice, nitrite curing salt and
optionally phosphate, at a temperature maintained between -2°C and 10°C,

preferably between -2°C and 3°C, by the addition of liquid nitrogen for 2 to 10
min,
chopping, while adding the fat, at a temperature maintained between 1°C and
10°C, preferably between 1°C and 7°C, by the addition of liquid nitrogen for up

to 10 min,
chopping to a temperature between 12°C and 15°C,
stuffing, redning and heating.
A process as claimed in claim 1, in which said meat is selected from a group
comprising lean meat having a fat content between 1 and 20%, meat having a

pH ≽ 6.0, dark, firm and dry meat and slaughter warm meat.
A process as claimed in claim 1, in which said added fat is a ground animal
fat.
A process as claimed in claim 1 , in which said added fat is a vegetable oil.
A process as claimed in claim 1, which comprises adding 1.2 to 2% nitrite
curing salt and up to 0.3% phosphate, especially sodium diphosphate. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, which comprises adding from 2 to 8 g mixed
spices, up to 1 g sodium ascorbate and up to 2 g dextrose per kg of meat batter

at the time the fat is added.
A process as claimed in claim 1, in which the pH of the meat batter is adjusted
by adding up to 3 g of sodium bicarbonate per kg.
A process according to claim 1, in which said meat batter comprises from 40
to 70% meat, up to 20% added fat and from 20 to 50% ice.
