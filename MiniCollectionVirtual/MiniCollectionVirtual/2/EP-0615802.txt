<ABSTRACT>
A conventional start-up head for a vertical continuous casting plant consists of a start-up brick (3) which closes a continuous casting mould at the bottom during start-up and receives from the shaping top section (1) a metal melt directed vertically onto the said start-up brick. In order to increase start-up reliability and the stability of the ingot and to significantly reduce the formation of a curve and the occurrence of bottom discard, it is proposed that the start-up brick (3) should consist of a block which corresponds approximately to the format of the continuous casting mould and into which is machined an essentially trough-shaped depression (5), the depression being delimited by an encircling rim (4), and that at least one raised portion (6) should be arranged in the depression (5) symmetrically to the centre lines (7, 8) of the start-up brick, the side walls of the encircling rim (4) and of the raised portion (6) being bevelled towards the depression (5).
