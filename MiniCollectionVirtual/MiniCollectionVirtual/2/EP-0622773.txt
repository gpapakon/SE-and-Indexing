<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of driving
liquid crystal apparatus, particularly apparatus for use
in television receivers, word processors, typewriters,
apparatus inclusive of a light valve for projectors, a
view finder for video camera recorders, or a computer
terminal monitor, particularly such liquid crystal
apparatus using a ferroelectric liquid crystal
(hereinafter sometimes abbreviated as "FLC") as a display
medium. It also concerns a liquid crystal apparatus
adapted to perform such method.Clark and Lagerwall have disclosed a bistable FLC
device using a surface-stabilised ferroelectric liquid
crystal in, e.g. Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 36, No.
11 (June 1, 1980), pp 899-901; Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Application JP-A-56-107217, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,367,924
and 4,563,059. Such a bistable ferroelectric liquid
crystal device has been realised by disposing a liquid
crystal between a pair of substrates disposed with a
spacing small enough to suppress the formation of a
helical structure inherent to liquid crystal molecules
in chiral smectic C phase (SmC*) or H phase (SmH*) of
bulk state and align vertical (smectic) molecular layers
each comprising a plurality of liquid crystal molecules
in one direction. Further, as a display device using such a
ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC), there is known one
wherein a pair of transparent substrates respectively
having thereon a transparent electrode and subjected
to an aligning treatment are disposed to be opposite
to each other with a cell gap of about 1 - 3 µm
therebetween so that their transparent electrodes are
disposed on the inner sides to form a blank cell,
which is then filled with a ferroelectric liquid
crystal, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,639,089;
4,655,561; and 4,681,404.The above-type of liquid crystal display
device using a ferroelectric liquid crystal has two
advantages. One is that a ferroelectric liquid
crystal has a spontaneous polarization so that a
coupling force between the spontaneous polarization
and an external electric field can be utilized for
switching. Another is that the long axis direction of
a ferroelectric liquid crystal molecule corresponds to
the direction of the spontaneous polarization in a
one-to-one relationship so that the switching is
effected by the polarity of the external electric
field. More specifically, the ferroelectric liquid
crystal in its chiral smectic phase shows bistability,
i.e., a property of assuming either one of a first and
a second optically stable state depending on the
polarity of an
