<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to catalyst compositions suitable for 
the (co) oligomerisation and for the (co)polymerisation of 
olefinically unsaturated hydrocarbons (Ziegler-Natta type 
catalysis), based on a Group 4 or 5 metal complex and a cocatalyst. Ziegler-Natta catalysts have a long history. The first reports 
on homogeneous olefin polymerisation catalysts composed of a Group 
4 metal complex and an alkylaluminium compound as cocatalyst were 
published by Breslow and Newburg (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 79 1957 5072 
and 81 1959 81). Subsequently, it was reported that the addition of 
small amounts of water to the above compositions increased the rate 
of polymerisation (W.P. Long, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 81 1959 5312; Long 
and Breslow, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 82 1960 1953). Later, Sinn and 
Kaminsky (e.g. in W. Kaminsky, Adv. Organmetal Chemistry 18 1980 
99) reacted the alkylaluminium with equimolar amounts of water to 
produce aluminoxane, which proved to be a much more effective 
cocatalyst. Currently, the best known aluminoxane cocatalyst is 
methyl aluminoxane (MAO). Still later, R.F. Jordan et al. (J. Am. 
Chem. Soc. 108 1986 1718 and 7410) replaced the cocatalyst by 
reacting the group 4 metal complex with a compound, the anion of 
which is substantially non-coordinating (protonation). K. Shelly 
and C.A. Reed (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 108 1986 3117) showed that the 
bulky carborate B₁₁CH₁₂ is "the least coordinating anion" and 
Turner (in EP-A 277003 and EP-A 277004) defined groups of bulky, 
substantially non-coordinating anions as cocatalysts with Group 4 
metallocene catalysts. The Group 4 metal compounds generally are metallocenes, 
containing in relation to the four valencies of the metal 1-4, in 
particular two, cyclopentadienyl (C₅H₅) rings, and 0-3, in 
particular also two, alkyl or halogen radicals. Several patent 
publications also claim similar Group 5 and 6 metallocenes, in 
addition the still preferred Group 4 metallocenes.  Illustrative examples of patent publications relating to the 
more modern Ziegler-Natta catalysts and disclosing their use in the 
polymerisation of olefins, in particular the production of solid, 
high-molecular polymers and copolymers of ethene, are:
 
   EP-B 69951 to HOECHST, disclosing catalyst compositions of 
bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium- dichloride or -methylchloride with 
methyl aluminoxane;
 
   EP-B 129368 to EXXON, disclosing catalyst compositions of 
substituted mono-, bis- and tri(cyclopentadienyl)-Group 4 metal 
halogenide or -hydrocarbide and an aluminoxane;
