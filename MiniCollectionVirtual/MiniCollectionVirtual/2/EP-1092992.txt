<ABSTRACT>
The present invention extracts the best combination of
refractive index Ni and thickness Di of each layer (2-6) in

a multilayered optical filter. A process of generating
initial pattern expressed as a matrix P = (X1, X2, X3, ..,

Xs) comprising elementary matrices Xi including
refractive index and thickness of the layer i of a

multilayered optical filter, a process of reproduction
and mutation for generating mutated patterns by

increasing or decreasing the refractive index and
thickness of the element Xi in the initial pattern, are

performed. A process of cross-over for selecting a pair
of patterns from a group consisted of mutated patterns

and initial patterns to substitute matrices in the pattern
pai
r are performed. A process of selection for selecting
highest patterns having optical characteristics closer

to the desired characteristics from within the initial
patterns, mutated pattern group, and crossed over pattern

group is performed. Then an algorithm process comprised
of a sequence of the above process steps is repeated with

respect to the predetermined number of selected patterns
until the optical characteristics of final selected

patterns fall into the desired error range for the desired
optical characteristics, thereby producing the best

multilayered optical filter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
producing optical multilayered optical filters, for
appropriately splitting/merging signal lights having
plural wavelength convoluted, used in an optical
communication system sending/receiving wavelengths
multiplexed light communications.As wavelength-multiplexed light communications
have been developed, there are needs for multilayered
splitting/merging filters having such characteristics as
a narrow passband or small para-reflex characteristics.For methods of designing multilayered optical
filters each layer of which has refractive index Ni and
thickness Di based on a desired optic characteristics,
in general, it has been common to use a method of thickness
optimization such as described in Japanese Published
Unexamined Patent Application No. 2650048, by determining
in advance refractive index Ni of each layer composing 
the filter, to preset the thickness Di, to determine
optical characteristics for each wavelength, to change
the thickness Di, to optimize the thickness Di so as to
have maximum in the optical characteristics.As another method of optimization, there is only
atrial and error method in which refractive index of a
layer is altered, and the thickness for every layer is
optimized again.In accordance with the method as described above,
since the refractive index Ni is predetermined, the degree
of freedom of design is not insufficient, and furthermore
the results may often fall into a local solution.In addition, there are a huge number of combinations
of Ni and Di in a multilayered optical filter so that the
optimization requires very long time for selection;
therefore the selection of the most optimized combination
has been practically impossible.In the Prior Art local resolution obtained by using
the thickness optimization method as have been described
above was needed and the only practical result.S. Martin et al : "Synthesis of optical multilayer systems using genetic
algorithms", Applied Optics, US, OSA, Washington, vol. 34, no 13, 1 May 1995,
p 2247 - 2254 describes a method of producing multilayered optical
filter using a genetic algorithm.The present invention been made in view of the above
circumstances and has an object to overcome the above
problems and to provide a method of production of
multilayered optical filters, used in the designing of
multilayered optical filters having such complex 
combinations as described above, for selecting the most
optimized combination of refractive index Ni and
thickness Di for each of layers without
