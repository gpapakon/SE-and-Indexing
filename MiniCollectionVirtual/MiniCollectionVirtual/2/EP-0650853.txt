<ABSTRACT>
Such is especially useful as a security system and 
constituent element in designing coins, medals and the 

like, and comprises providing the surface at issue with 
a relief formed by a mesh of straight parallel furrows 

(1), the side walls (2) and (3) of which are at a given 
angle to the general surface plane, the said furrows 

being identical in size and shape, and preferably having 
a triangular isosceles section, in order that one of its 

faces or walls (2) is parallel in all, as is the case of 
the other (3), one of the two drawings being printed on 

a group of faces (2) of such ridges and the other drawing 
on the second group of faces (3) of such ridges, and more 

specifically by providing bas-reliefs (4) and (5) on such 
faces (2) and (3), based upon a considerably greater 

inclination at given areas of such faces, specifically at 
the areas participating in the respective drawing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
obtaining double picture prints on any kind of hard 
surface, which process is particularly useful as a 
security system and a constituent element in designing 
coins, medals and the like, so that the said process 
allows two different pictures to be viewed on the same 
relief, being alternately visible depending upon the 
impingement of the light, i.e. one of the pictures will 
be visible in a given position and on tilting the piece 
slightly the said picture will be concealed and the other 
will come to light. In the preferred field of practical application of 
the invention the double picture print system prevents 
the coins from being copied using matrix systems 
traditionally used in counterfeiting. There are currently no security elements effectively 
preventing counterfeiting in the field of coin printing. The visual checking of the genuineness of a coin 
depends upon the quality of the prints, that can in 
certain copies be very high. A method that is often used in the fraudulent  
 
manufacture of coin moulds and which yields good results, 
is electroerosion, though this method is limited to 
prints with certain minimum dimensions, below which the 
method cannot be applied, bearing in mind that the size 
of the spark produced in turn limits such dimensions. The process for obtaining double picture prints upon 
hard surfaces subject of the invention comprises 
initially making a relief formed by a mesh of straight 
and parallel furrows the side walls of which are at a 
particular angle to the general plane of the hard surface 
in question, viz. the said mesh has a triangular, 
preferably isosceles, section. Each of the two pictures to be obtained is formed by 
all the walls pointing in the save direction, i.e. one of 
the walls in each and every furrow, that pointing in the 
same direction, is the base for representing a drawing, 
whereas the other wall shall in turn provide the base for 
representing the other drawing. For its part, each of these two drawings is in turn 
defined by a variation in the degree of inclination of 
certain areas or each of the respective walls, which 
inclination is considerably greater to the general plane 
of the hard surface being treated. In accordance with the above, the resolution of the 
picture shall depend directly upon the number of furrows 
used in the print, and their relief shall be dependent 
upon the type of minting, size of the print, distance 
between the furrows and inclination of its walls. As a

A process for obtaining double picture prints 
on hard surface, being especially useful as a security 

system and constituent element in designing coins, medals 
and the like, characterised in comprising the provision 

of a relief formed by a mesh of straight parallel furrows 
(1), the side walls (2) and (3) of which are at a given 

angle to the general surface plane, it being provided 
that each of the two pictures to be printed be defined on 

the group of faces (2) or (3) of the said furrows (1), 
pointing in a given direction, and be obtained by means 

of a plurality of bas-reliefs that may take up to a 
greater or lesser extent one or more areas of all or part 

of the said faces pointing in the same direction, which 
bas-reliefs are obtained by a variation in the angle of 

such faces, in particular with a considerably greater 
angle to the general plane of the hard surface at issue, 

the number of furrows used in the print being variable, 
directly in proportion to the resolution of the picture 

that is to be obtained.
