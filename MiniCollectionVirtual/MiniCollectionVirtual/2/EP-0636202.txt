<ABSTRACT>
Use of a pressurized medium in a drilling apparatus for drilling a hole in the ground. The drilling apparatus comprises a drilling device (1), such as a down-the-hole drill or the like, the first end thereof having a drilling means, such as a drill bit (2), and the second end thereof being at least connectable by joining means (3) with one or more separate drill rods (4) for increasing the drilling depth of the drilling device in the direction of the longitudinal axis (k); scavenging means (8) for removing drilling waste generated by the effect of the drilling means (2); and a support frame (9) at least indirectly supported by the ground. The drilling device (1) is arranged to be driven by a feeding movement in the direction of its longitudinal axis (k) and by a to-and-fro or corresponding percussion movement as well as by a rotational movement or the like in relation to its longitudinal axis (k). The percussion means (6) of the drilling apparatus for providing the percussion movement of the drilling device (1) are arranged to be hydraulically operated by an organic, oil-based pressurized medium (m) derived from a natural biological metabolism, such as a vegetable oil, an animal oil, or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of a pressurized 
medium particularly as the pressurized medium for 
the percussion means in a drilling device of a drilling 
apparatus for drilling a hole in the ground by down-the-hole 
drilling method. The drilling apparatus comprises: 
a drilling device, the first end thereof having a 
drilling means, such as a drill bit or the like, 
and the second end of the same being connectable 
with one or several drill rods for increasing the 
drilling depth of the drilling device, percussion means in the drilling device for generating 
the percussion movement, which means are 
arranged to be driven by a pressurized liquid 
medium supplied through a first flowing arrangement, scavenging means for removing drilling waste 
generated by the effect of the drilling means, the 
scavenging means being arranged to supply a scavenging 
agent through a second flowing arrangement in 
connection with the drilling device and the drill 
rod, and a support frame being at least indirectly supported 
by the ground. Apparatuses of the type described above, using pressurized 
air, have been known for a long time and are 
widely used in mineral industry. It is an advantage 
of a drilling device to be placed down the hole that 
the percussion impact is directed to the drill bit, 
whereby the energy losses and unnecessary wearing of 
the components of the apparatus can be reduced in 
comparison with solutions having the drilling device 
placed at the rear end of drilling rods. Conventionally 
in drilling devices driven by pressurized air, pressurized 
air is used also for scavenging the crushed  
 
aggregate. However, it is not advantageous to drive a 
drilling device by pressurized air, e.g. because 
this requires a compressor unit with a very high 
capacity. Furthermore, the efficiency of a pneumatic 
system is clearly lower than that of a hydraulic 
system. The use of a hydraulic drilling machine is known e.g. 
from the published international application 
PCT/EP89/00256. In the solution of the above application, 
the driving unit of the drill rod, driven by a 
pressurized medium, conveys a to-and-fro rotational 
motion to the drill rod, as distinguished from the 
rotational motion conventionally used. Thus, hoses 
are arranged between the drill rod and the walls of 
the drill hole, whereby upon inserting or removing 
rods, hoses are fed into the hole or reeled in from 
the hole. For achieving an optimal drilling efficiency 
and for saving the hoses, the angle of rotation of 
the drill rod is

Use of an organic, oil-based pressurized medium 
derived from natural biological metabolism, such as a 

vegetable oil, an animal oil, or the like, as the 
pressurized medium (m) for the percussion means (6) 

in a drilling device (1) of a drilling apparatus for 
drilling a hole in the ground by down-the-hole drilling 

method, whereby the use comprises: 

causing the organic oil-based pressurized medium 
derived from natural biological metabolism to flow 

in the drilling hole through the drilling device (1) 
and one or several drill rods (4) which are used 

for increasing the drilling depth of the drilling 
device (1), 
driving the percussion means (6) for generating 
the percussion movement by the organic oil-based 

pressurized medium derived from natural biological 
metabolism supplied through a first flowing arrangement 

(5) in connection with the drilling device (1) 
and the drill rod (4), 
removing drilling waste generated by the effect of 
drilling means (2) at the end of the drilling device 

(1) by means of a scavenging agent supplied 
through a second flowing arrangement (7) in connection 

with the drilling device (1) and the drill 
rod (4), and 
supporting the drilling apparatus with a support 
frame (9) being at least indirectly supported by 

the ground. 
Use of a pressurized medium according to claim 1, 

wherein
 the pressurized medium (m) is vegetable-based, 

such as a rape-oil-based hydraulic fluid or 
the like.  

 
Use of a pressurized medium according to claim 1 
or 2, 
wherein
 the pressurized medium (m) is a 
hydraulic fluid based on a vegetable oil ester.
