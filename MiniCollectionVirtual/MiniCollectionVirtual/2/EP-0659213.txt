<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to growth inhibitory antagonists of bovine growth hormone obtained by mutation of the third alpha helix of that protein. These novel hormones may be administered exogenously to animals, or transgenic animals may be made that express the antagonist and thereby exhibited a reduced growth phenotype.

 GROWTH HORMONE ANTAGONISTSThis application is a continuation-in-part of U 07/693,305, filed May 1, 1991, now pending, which is continuation-in-part of PCT/US90/05874, filed October 12, 19 which is a continuation-in-part of USSN 07/419,561, fi October 12, 1989, all of which are hereby incorporated reference herein.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThis invention relates to novel growth hormo especially bovine growth hormone, muteins which inhibit growth of animals or otherwise antagonize the effects endogenous growth hormone. These analogues may be expressed transgenic animals which thereby acquire a "reduced grow phenotype.Information Disclosure StatementBovine growth hormone (GH) is a protein of 191 am acids that is naturally synthesized in the anterior pituita The molecular weight of the mature protein is about 22, daltons, but it is initially made as a pre-growth hormone w an extra 26 amino acids on the amino terminal. This leader signal peptide) is normally cleaved during secretion of hormone by bovine pituitary cells. Several forms of the mat protein have been found in nature. The N-terminal can v (due to variation in the site of cleavage during secretion) that the mature protein begins with either NH2 -Ala-Phe-Pro NH2-Phe-Pro. Additionally, the amino acid at position 126 be either leucine or valine, apparently as a result of alle variation in the bovine population.Exogenous administration of bGH to cattle increa milk production, feed efficiency, growth rate, and the lean- fat ratio, and decreases fattening time. 

 bGH has been produced by recombinant DNA techniqu see e.g., Fraser, U.S. 4,443,539 (yeast); Buell, EP Ap 103,395 (bacteria); Krivl, EP Appl. 193,515 (bacteri Kopchick, EP Appl. 161,640 (encapsulated mouse cells implan into animals); DeBoer, EP Appl. 75,444 (bacteria; gene modif to eliminate harmful secondary structure) and this facilitated the production of analogues of bGH by site-speci mutagenesis. Thus, Aviv, GB 2,073,245 describes production Met Pro (des Ala) bGH, Met Arg (des Ala) bGH, Met-Glu-Gly ( Ala) bGH, and des (Ala1Phe2-Pro3 -Ala*) bGH i coli. Bre et al., PNAS (USA) 85:3367-71 (1988) reported preparation the bGH mutant K112L, which extended the hydrophobic face the third alpha helix of bGH. The 96-133 fragment of t mutant was also prepared.The biological activity of proteolytic fragments bGH has also been studied.
