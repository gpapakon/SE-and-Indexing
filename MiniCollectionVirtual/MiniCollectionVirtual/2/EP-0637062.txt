<ABSTRACT>
On the surface of a semiconductor layer structure (1) which has elevations (2) up to a maximum step height, an insulating layer (4), the thickness of which is greater than the maximum step height, is applied. The insulating layer (4) is structured such that it has uneven zones (7) having essentially the same lateral extent in the region of the edges of the elevations (2). The uneven zones (7) are planarised by chemical/mechanical polishing and/or deposition, flow-out and etching-back of a planarisation layer.

Process for producing a semiconductor layer 
structure having a planarized surface, 


in which a stop layer (3, 3'), an insulating layer 
(4, 4') and an auxiliary layer (5, 5') are applied 

to the surface of the semiconductor layer structure 
(1, 1'), which surface has elevations (2, 2') having 

a height up to a maximum step height, 
in which the thickness of the insulating layer (4, 
4') is greater than the maximum step height, 
in which the stop layer (3, 3') is applied with 
essentially conformal edge covering, 
in which the insulating layer (4, 4') can be selectively 
etched both with respect to the auxiliary 

layer (5, 5') and with respect to the stop layer (3, 
3'), 
in which openings (6) whose extent is less than or 
equal to the lateral extent of the elevations (2, 

2') and in which the surface of the insulating layer 
(4, 4') is exposed are produced in the auxiliary 

layer (5, 5') above the elevations (2, 2'), 
in which the insulating layer (4, 4') is structured 
in an isotropic etching process selectively with 

respect to the auxiliary layer (5) and with respect 
to the stop layer (3, 3') in such a way that it has 

unevennesses (7, 7') having an essentially identical 
lateral extent in the region of the edges of the 

elevations (2, 2'), 
in which the auxiliary layer (5) is removed following 
the structuring of the insulating layer (4, 4'),  

 
- in which the unevennesses (7, 7') are planarized by 

chemical mechanical polishing and/or deposition, 
flowing and etching back of a planarization layer 

(9), 
 
characterized in that the stop layer has Si
3
N
4
 at least at 
its surface and the auxiliary layer is formed from 

polysilicon. 
Method according to Claim 1, 

in which the openings (6) in the auxiliary layer (5) 
are formed with the aid of a photolithographic 

process using an additional mask, 
in which the additional mask has essentially the 
same structures with inverse contrast as a mask used 

for producing the elevations (2, 2'). 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2,
 
in which the isotropic etching process is carried out at 

most until the surface of the stop layer is reached 
inside the openings. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2,
 
in which the isotropic etching process is carried out at 

least until a material thickness of d
ox
 = h + h/2 + D has 
been etched, where h is the thickness of the insulation 

layer (4) and D is the out-of-alignment with which the 
openings (6) are produced relative to the elevations (2). 
Process according to Claim 4,
 
in which the removal of the auxiliary layer (5) is 

followed by whole-area application of a further insulating 
layer (8), which is provided with an essentially 

planar surface with the aid of chemical mechanical 
polishing and/or by deposition, flowing and etching back 

a planarization layer (9). 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
 
in which the insulating layer (4) is an intermediate 

oxide layer and in which the semiconductor layer structure 
comprises an insulated circuit realised on a silicon 

base. 
Use of a process according to one of Claims 1 to 
6
 
in the production of a bipolar transistor, wherein an  

 
opening onto a semiconductor surface is produced in the 

insulating layer (104) after the formation of the planar 
surface, in which opening active transistor regions (105) 

are produced by selective epitaxy. 
Use of a process according to one of Claims 1 to 
6
 
in the production of a DRAM with shallow trench insulation.
