<ABSTRACT>
A radio transmission system for a touch trigger probe (10) 
for machine tools or coordinate measuring machines is 

described. In the transmitter shown in Fig 1, a 1kHz 
oscillator (16) produces a signal which is phase modulated 

by an electronic switch (14) and an inverter (28), when 
electrical contacts (11) within the probe (10) change 

state. This phase modulated signal is mixed in a mixer 
(24) with an unmodulated 500Hz reference signal, produced 

in a divider (18) from the oscillator (16), so that there 
is a precise phase relationship between the two signals. 

The receiver shown in Fig 2 has filters (38, 42) which 
separate out the 500Hz reference signal and the phase 

modulated 1kHz signal. A decoder (44) phase demodulates 
the 1kHz signal, using the 500Hz signal as a reference in 

order to increase the reliability of the resulting signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to probes for use on machines which
determine a position of a workpiece, such as coordinate
measuring machines and machine tools. More particularly,
it relates to signal transmission systems for such probes.A trigger probe for such purposes is described in US patent
4,153,998 (McMurtry). In use, the probe is moved by the
machine relative to a workpiece. The probe has a
deflectable stylus, and delivers a trigger signal when the
stylus contacts the workpiece. The trigger signal is
indicated by the probe switching from one state to another.
The trigger signal is used by the control of the machine to
freeze the outputs of scales or other measuring means which
indicate the position of the probe. The position of the
point of contact on the workpiece surface can thus be
determined.Especially on machine tools, it can be difficult to wire
the probe directly to the machine control, and so various
wireless signal transmission systems have been developed in
the prior art. These include inductive systems (where the
signal is transmitted by electro-magnetic induction between
two coils); optical systems (where an optical emitter such
an infra-red diode is provided on the probe and produces an
optical signal which is received by an appropriate
receiver); and radio systems (having a radio transmitter in
the probe and a radio receiver fixed at a convenient
location on the machine). An example of an optical system
is shown in European Patent Application EP 337,671
(Renishaw). An example of a radio system is shown in US
Patent 4,118,871 (Kearney & Trecker). An important requirement of such probes is repeatability,
i.e. that the same result should be achieved every time a
given measurement is repeated. The mechanical position of
the stylus in the probes described in US patent 4,153,998
is extremely repeatable in space, and the instant of
production of the trigger signal always has a definite,
repeatable relationship with the instant of contact between
the stylus and the workpiece. This means that accurate
results can be obtained from the probe by a simple
calibration procedure.However, the accuracy would be destroyed if the signal
transmission system were not repeatable, that is, if there
were an unknown, variable delay in the signal transmission.
If this occurs, then the probe will travel an unknown,
variable distance after the instant of generation of the
trigger signal before the machine control is able to freeze
the outputs of the measuring means. There is then an error
between the position of
