<ABSTRACT>
A polyester film having a coefficient of dynamic friction 
between the film and a metal at 80°C of not more than 0.45, a 

polyester film composed of a polyester comprising an ethylene 
terephthalate unit in a proportion of 70% or more by mole, the 

polyester film comprising a cyclic ethylene terephthalate 
trimer in a proportion of 0.7% or less by weight, laminated 

metal sheets and metal containers manufactured from said 
laminated metal sheet. According to the present invention, the 

polyester film shows superior sliding property and superior 
scratch resistance during can production, as well as the elution 

of oligomer from the film can be suppressed, so that when the 
film is used for metal containers for food, the change in taste 

and smell of the food contained therein and degraded appearance 
of the surface of the film caused by the deposition of oligomer 

are avoided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyester film for
laminating with a metal material mainly usable for food such as
soft drinks, beer and canned food, a metal sheet laminated with
said film and to metal containers produced by forming said
laminated metal sheet into a can shape. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a polyester film with superior
scratch resistance during can production process to afford good
productivity of the cans, a metal sheet laminated with said film
and to metal containers produced by forming said laminated
metal sheet into a can shape. Moreover, the present invention
relates to a polyester film with suppressed elution of low
molecular substances from the film due to a heat treatment after
packing the food therein, such as retort treatment, a metal
sheet laminated with said film and to metal containers produced
by forming said laminated metal sheet into a can shape.For inhibiting corrosion of the inner and outer surfaces of
metal cans, paints are conventionally applied, wherein used as
the paints are thermosetting resins.Other methods include the use of thermoplastic resins. For
example, a polyolefin film is laminated with a tin-free steel
heated or a polyester film with good heat resistance is
laminated with a metal sheet to be used for cans. Many thermosetting paints are of solvent type. For forming
a coating therefrom, a high temperature heating for a long time
at 150-250°C for several minutes and baking which undesirably
causes evaporation of a large amount of organic solvent are
necessary. Accordingly, simplification of steps and
improvements to prevent pollution are desired. It is
inevitable, moreover, that a small amount of organic solvent
remains in the coating when the thermosetting paints are applied
under the above-mentioned conditions and the remainder of the
organic solvent migrates into the food packed in a metal can
applied with the coating to result in degraded taste and smell
of the food. Also, the additives in the paint or low molecular
substances which may be produced by an incomplete crosslinking
reaction may move into the food to exert the same adverse
influences.Of the above-mentioned problems, simplification of the
steps and prevention of pollution can be achieved by the use of
thermoplastic resin films. However, polyolefin films such as
those made from polyethylene and polypropylene, which are among
thermoplastic resins, have poor heat resistance and sometimes
whiten and peel off from a metal sheet upon a retort treatment.In addition,
