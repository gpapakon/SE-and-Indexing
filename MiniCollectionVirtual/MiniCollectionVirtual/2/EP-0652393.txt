<ABSTRACT>
A filling cap (1) has a safety system consisting of 
a stem valve (9) with pressure sealing seat (11) and 

calibrated counter-spring (12) and a bimetallic body (14) 
or an expanding-fluid capsule and combined with a means 

of release (18) of the gripping cap (21) of said cap. 
Said bimetallic device or cap are sensitive to and 

operate on the release means on the basis of temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dual function 
safety valve applicable preferably but non in a limiting 
manner to filling caps for boilers or the like and in 
particular to domestic or industrial boilers for ironing 
machines. Said valve comprises a first stem engaging with the 
corresponding seat by means of the mechanical pressure 
exerted by a calibrated counter-spring. Said stem is 
virtually of the conventional type and engages its seat 
and forms a seal thereon up to a predetermined safety 
pressure beyond which there occurs opening of the 
overload valve on the spring. In coaxial combination or 
not with said stem is prearranged a bimetallic body or an 
expanding-fluid capsule sensitive to and deformable on 
the basis of the temperature. Said body or cap, 
prescinding from the presence of pressure inside the 
boiler or the like and with temperature higher than a 
predetermined safety level, deforms and causes detachment 
of connection and disconnection means between an idly 
rotating part and the actual cap screwed onto the body 
under pressure. Detachment of the connection means prevents 
unscrewing of the cap even after release of the pressure 
if the temperature in the assembly is high. It is known that due to functional exigencies and 
the need for safety all pressurised bodies must be 
equipped with devices designed to prevent the formation  
 
of dangerous overpressure and ensure the safety of 
operators. Such devices are technically necessary and legally 
required to ensure safety and at present consist of 
automatic valves which by means of simple mechanical or 
electromechanical systems or even electronic systems with 
sensors are adjustable in accordance with levels 
predetermined on the basis of working pressure levels and 
applications and intervene by discharging excess pressure 
into the atmosphere. Said safety valves are used in industrial and/or 
domestic systems on boilers, pots, steam irons and so 
forth. The most elementary of such valves comprise 
virtually a stem remaining engaged in the corresponding 
seat under the effect of a counter-spring whose pressure 
strength is calibrated at the maximum pressure admissible 
in the body. In other solutions the safety valves consist of 
bimetallic membranes or expanding-fluid capsules which 
deform and expand to open the seats with which they are 
coupled upon reaching the tolerated limit pressure. Said safety devices, although valid from the 
functional viewpoint in relation to pure pressure, 
exhibit some limitations when the
