<ABSTRACT>
In an insulated gate semiconductor device such as a 16BT, MCT or 
power MOSFET, a loss is suppressed and a 

short-circuit tolerance as well as a latch-up tolerance are improved. 
By adding a channel region of high threshold (32A) between the emitter 

region (4) and the channel region of low threshold (3), the 

saturation current I
CE
(sat) and the short-circuit tolerance tw 
are reduced without 

much influencing a collector-emitter saturation voltage 
V
CE
(sat). When the sheet 
resistance of the n type emitter region (4) 

is in the range between 40Ω/□ and 150Ω/□, 10 µ sec 
or more of the 

short-circuit tolerance, which is practically sufficient, is ensured 
while the 

collector-emitter saturation voltage V
CE
(sat) is suppressed to 
practically small 

2.4V or less. Both the collector-emitter saturation voltage 
V
CE
(sat) and the 
saturation current I
CE
(sat) are restrained small, thereby 
realizing an enhanced short-circuit tolerance. Also disclosed is a 

highly-doped gate electrode and methods of making the same.

base region 3 is formed in a partial region in the top major surface of the

formed on the top surface of the n-type epitaxial layer 2. A gate electrode 6
made of, for example, polycrystalline silicon (hereinafter referred to as
polysilicon) is formed on the gate insulating film 5. The emitter electrode 7
made of, for example, aluminum is formed such that it is electrically connected
to both the p-type base region 3 and the n-type emitter regions 4. The gate
electrode 6 and the emitter electrode 7 are insulated from each other by an
oxide film 8 serving as inter-layer insulating film, and are electrically connected
in common in and between all of the IGBT unit cells 110. A high-concentration
p-type semiconductor region 31 is formed in the p-type base
region 3 through diffusion of
