<ABSTRACT>
The carbon black contained in the gas consuming layer on the surface of a negative electrode comes from a mixture of an aqueous carbon black dispersion and an aqueous PTFE dispersion, both of which contain, for stabilisation, a surfactant of the same type in each case - cationic, anionic or non-ionic. The stabilised particles present in the finished gas consuming dispersion are formed by coating PTFE particles (1) with smaller carbon particles (2), with the interposition of, or enveloping with, surfactant films (4), pores and cracks (3) enlarging the effective catalyst surface with respect to the oxygen gas. Polyacrylate additives are suitable for setting the viscosity of the dispersion. The dispersion is applied to the electrode by means of dipping or spraying.
