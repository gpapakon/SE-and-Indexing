<ABSTRACT>
An aim is to provide a MOS integrated circuit with improved static electricity 
tolerance without sacrificing the high speed characteristic of an IC on a SOI substrate. A 

semiconductor device in which the thickness of a silicon single crystal thin film device 
forming layer (103) of an input/output protection circuit forming region (104) in a MOS 

integrated circuit on a SOI substrate (101,102) is made greater than the thickness of the 
silicon single crystal thin film device forming region (103) of a MOS integrated circuit 

forming region (105). 
The benefits can also be attained when the semiconductor device is used in a light 
valve device such as an active matrix liquid crystal display device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, and in particular to, but
not exclusively to, an input/output protection circuit for a MOS type integrated circuit on
a silicon single crystal thin film on an insulation layer, and also relates to a light valve
device using the semiconductor device.Heretofore, an integrated circuit has been formed on a silicon, single crystal, thin
film disposed on an insulation layer which is disposed on a substrate. An input/output
protection circuit has been formed in this silicon, single crystal, thin film device forming
layer.Figure 2 illustrates a conventional input/output protection circuit 104 for an
integrated circuit formed on a silicon, single crystal, thin film 103 on an insulation layer
102. The input/output protection circuit 104 is formed in the silicon, single crystal, thin
film device forming layer 103. This device forming layer 103 has the same thickness as
a MOS type integrated circuit forming region 105.The input/output protection circuit 101 requires high speed operation and hitherto
there has been a problem in that a diode or a field transistor used as a device for the
input/output protection circuit cannot function sufficiently compared with being formed
on a bulk silicon substrate. This is attributable to the fact that the thickness of the
silicon, single crystal, thin film device forming layer has to be greatly reduced (less than
100 nm) so that the channel region of the MOS type transistor is completely depleted in
order to provide the high speed characteristic of the MOS type integrated circuit on the
silicon, single crystal, thin film on the insulation layer. If a normal diode or field
transistor is formed on such a thin film, the junction portion of the P- and N-type
diffusion regions 106, 107 is restricted. In the case where the diode is formed as shown
in figure 4, the regions are restricted to the lateral sides thereof, thereby greatly reducing
the junction area. In the case of a field transistor as shown in figure 6, a field oxide film 
110 reaches as far as a buried insulation film 102, which results in the field transistor being
unable to function.An application of such circuits is shown in figure 14, which illustrates an active matrix
liquid crystal display device in which a silicon, single crystal, thin film 103 is disposed on an
insulation layer 102. A driving substrate 501 is formed with a group of integrated circuits
502, 502' and a counter substrate 504 is formed with a counter electrode 503 disposed on a
further silicon,
