<ABSTRACT>
The hermetic closure comprises a cap assembly (10) 
provided with a cap (1) which, when unscrewed, 

cause a breakage of struts (5) and a detachment of 
a safety strip (4), and also comprises a seal 

which, when the cap assembly (10) is inserted on a 
container, guarantees a seal on a lateral wall of 

a dispenser (7), even when the cap (1) is subject 
to small axial displacements with respect to the 

container.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hermetic closure in a 
cap assembly for containers equipped with 
dispensers devices. In particular, reference is made to a hermetic 
closure for containers having a small opening 
provided on a dispenser, such as a spout, a spray, 
a drop-counter and the like, where factory sealing 
of the container is guaranteed by a safety device 
that is broken on first use of the container. This safety device is usually a detachable safety 
strip connected to a a cap by easy-break struts, 
which are fractured by an axial movement of the 
cap in an upwards direction, that is to say in an 
opening direction of the container. This usually 
means an unscrewing movement. Further, as the cap is generally made in fairly 
rigid plastic material, not normally able to 
ensure a good isolation of the contents inside the 
container, the hermetic efficiency of the closure 
is instead guaranteed by such systems as contact  
 
between the internal surface of the upper part of 
the cap and the upper surface of the dispenser and 
the container. Some examples of such containers are tubes and 
flagons for pharmaceutical products such as 
eyedrops, ointments, solutions, and so on. One of the drawbacks presented in known closures 
is that it is often possible slightly to unscrew 
the cap, enough to cause the seal to be broken 
while not sufficiently to make it obvious to a 
consumer that the seal has in fact been broken. In 
pharmaceutical products especially this can mean a 
crucial loss of sterility which may go unnoticed 
at first. In bottles such seal breakage can be achieved by 
simply squeezing the bottle and releasing it, so 
that it functions as a suction pump. With rigid 
containers, it may be enough to immerse them fully 
in a bath containing sufficient fluid for them to 
lose their purity. In short, in the above case the 
mere presence of an unbroken safety strip is not a 
guarantee that the container has not been tampered 
with. A principal aim of the present invention is to 
obviate the above drawback, by providing a  
 
hermetic closure with a plastic cap assembly, for 
containers having dispenser devices, in which the 
integrity of the safety guarantee device is a true 
guarantee that no violation has taken place, and 
also that none of the container contents have 
escaped nor extraneous contents been introduced. One advantage of the invention is that it provides 
a constructionally simple closure while achieving 
its set aim, so that no utilization complications 
arise from it. The above aims

<CLAIMS>
A hermetic closure in a plastic cap assembly (10), 
(10') for containers provided with a dispenser 

(7), (7'), wherein the cap assembly (10) (10') 
comprises a cap (1), (1'), applied on a container 

neck (9), (9'), which when unscrewed and raised in 
an axial direction causes a detachment of a safety 

strip (4) from the cap assembly (10), (10'), 
characterised in that it comprises a seal ring 

interposed between an external lateral surface of 
the dispenser (7), (7') and an internal lateral 

surface of the cap (1), (1'), which seal ring 
remains fully effective both when the cap (1), 

(1') is applied on the neck (9) (9') and when the 
cap (1) is axially and upwardly displaced by 

distances not superior to an axial displacement 
necessary in order to cause a detachment of the 

safety strip (4) from the cap (1). 
A closure as in claim 1, characterised in that the 
seal ring (6) is arranged on an external lateral 

surface of the dispenser (7) and, when the cap 
 

assembly (10) is mounted, seals against an annular 
contact zone of an internal lateral surface of the 

cap (1); said seal ring (6) having a greater 
external diameter than a maximum diameter of an 

internal surface of the cap (1) immediately 
underlying said annular contact zone and being at 

least as long, measuring in an axial direction, as 
an axial displacement necessary in order to detach 

the safety strip (4). 
A closure as in claim 1, characterised in that the 
seal comprises an annular element (6') arranged on 

the internal lateral surface of the dispenser (7) 
which when the cap assembly (10) is mounted seals 

on an annular contact zone of an external lateral 
surface of a cylindrical element (11') solid to 

the cap (1'); said annular element (6') having a 
smaller internal diameter than a minimum diameter 

of the external surface of the cylindrical element 
(11') solid to the cap (1') and immediately 

underlying said annular contact zone, and being at 
least as long, in an axial direction, as an axial 

displacement necessary to detach the safety strip 
(4).
