A process for cleaning floors using alkyl ether sulfates, characterized 
in that an aqueous surfactant solution is applied to the floor in undiluted form 

in a quantity of 0.2 to 5 g per square metre and is distributed over the floor by 
wiping, the surfactant solution containing a combination of alkyl polyglycoside 

and alkyl ether sulfate. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, in which the surfactant solution 
additionally contains a water-miscible, volatile organic solvent. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which the surfactant solution 
contains 0.2 to 4% by weight of a surfactant mixture of alkyl polyglycoside 

and alkyl ether sulfate. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, in which alkyl polyglycoside 
and alkyl ether sulfate are present in the surfactant solution in a ratio by 

weight of 4:1 to 1:4 and preferably 2:1 to 1:2. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, in which the surfactant 
solution additionally contains a floor-care substance from the group of waxes, 

film-forming polymers and mixtures thereof. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, in which the surfactant 
solution is applied by spraying, preferably in a quantity of 0.3 to 2 g per 

square metre.
