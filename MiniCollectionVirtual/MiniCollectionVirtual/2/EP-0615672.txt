<ABSTRACT>
To tune a radio receiver to a transmitter with a certain type of programme using RDS data, first of all the radio receiver is set to any transmitter transmitting a programme which meets the user's wishes. The PTY information of this transmitter obtained from the RDS data is stored by operating the appropriate control (20) to set a filter, the filter condition of which corresponds to this PTY information. When the radio receiver is subsequently set to another transmitter, for example by means of transmitter finding, the latter is regarded as receivable only if it meets the filter condition.

A method for the tuning of a broadcast radio
receiver to a transmitter of a determined type program using

RDS information, characterized in that

the broadcast radio receiver is tuned to any transmitter
broadcasting a program which meets the wishes of the

user,
from the RDS information, which is broadcast by the
tuned in transmitter with the program, the information (PTY)

indicating the type of program is obtained,
by actuation of an associated control element (20)
filter is set, whose filter condition is agreement with this

information characteristic of such type of program,
in the course of ensuing tuning of the broadcast radio
receiver to another transmitter, information thereof

characteristic of the type of program is also obtained and
each transmitter then tuned in is only taken into
account as being suitable for reception if it complies with

the filter condition.
The method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that the filter condition is disabled by renewed actuation

of the control element. 
The method as claimed in claim 2, characterized in
that the active status of the filter condition is indicated

by an indicating element associated with the control
element.
The method as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that when the filter is enabled and

a search sweep is being performed such sweep is only halted
at a transmitter found thereby when such transmitter

fulfills the filter condition.
The method as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that when the filter is enabled and

a search sweep is being performed periodically or
continuously a transmitter found is only stored in a

transmitter table if it complies with the filter condition.
The method as claimed in claim 4 or in claim 5,
characterized in that by actuation of a separate control

element a transmitter search sweep is started, the reception
quality of each transmitter found, which fulfills the filter

condition, is determined and an evaluation characteristic
thereof is stored with the transmission frequency

temporarily, and finally, of the stored transmission
frequencies that one is tuned to for reception whose

evaluation leads to the best reception quality.
