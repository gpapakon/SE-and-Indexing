<ABSTRACT>
A navigation system for a vehicle comprises a central 
processing unit (102a) for executing a plurality of programs including 

a navigation program and a transmitting program, and an internal 
nonvolatile storage device (102b) electrically connected to the 

central processing unit through an inner bus (102c) and storing 
therein the transmitting program. The navigation system further 

comprises an external storage device (103) electrically connected to 
the inner bus (102c) through an interface unit (102g) and storing 

therein the navigation program. The central processing unit (102a) 
is initially operated to execute the transmitting program to read the 

navigation program from the external storage device (103) and store 
the read navigation program in the internal nonvolatile storage 

device (102b), and subsequently operated to repeat the execution of 
the navigation program stored in the internal nonvolatile storage 

device (102b) to provide a vehicle driver with navigation information 
including the current location of the vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a navigation 
system for a vehicle and particularly to a navigation system comprising 
a navigation apparatus which is mounted on a vehicle for 
providing a vehicle driver with the navigation information such as 
vehicle current location by executing a navigation program stored 
in a storage device included in the navigation apparatus. A variety of navigation apparatus has so far been developed 
and used to readily guide a vehicle driver to his destination in 
an unfamiliar area. Such a navigation apparatus is mounted on a 
vehicle as comprising a display unit such as a CRT (Cathode Ray 
Tube) display for having current location of a vehicle displayed on 
its screen with a road map around the current location of the vehicle, 
a control unit including a mask read-only memory (hereinlater 
simply referred to as "mask ROM") storing therein various programs 
including at least one navigation program, and a central processing 
unit (hereinlater simply referred to as "CPU") for executing the 
various programs. The current location of the vehicle displayed on 
the screen of the display unit is obtained by executing the navigation 
program stored in the mask ROM of the control unit. The navigation 
apparatus thus constructed, however, has a drawback in that 
a user of the navigation apparatus, for example, the vehicle driver 
cannot change and modify the navigation program after the user 
purchases the navigation apparatus, since the navigation program is 
previously stored in the mask ROM of the control unit. To avoid 
such a drawback, there has been proposed an improved navigation 
system, for instance, disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication  
 
No. 4-195184 and shown partially in Fig. 23. The navigation apparatus shown in Fig. 23 comprises a 
location detecting unit 11 for detecting the current location of a 
vehicle, a CD-ROM (Compact Disk Read-only Memory) drive unit 12 
for reading a navigation program stored in a CD-ROM (not shown), a 
display unit 13 for displaying on its screen the current location of 
the vehicle with a road map around the current location of the 
vehicle, a control unit 14 for controlling the location detecting unit 
11, the CD-ROM drive unit 12 and the display unit 13. The control 
unit 14 comprises a CPU 14a for executing the navigation program, a 
RAM (Random Access Memory) 14b for temporally storing therein the 
navigation program, navigation data and so on, and an inner bus 14c 
for electrically connecting the CPU14a and the
