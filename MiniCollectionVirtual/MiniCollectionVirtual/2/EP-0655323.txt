<ABSTRACT>
Electronic components, chips, are moulded in a 
single-strip moulding apparatus. The products to be moulded 

are placed in a mould consisting of two halves, one of the 
halves whereof displays recesses for receiving a component, 

which half is connected via a channel with a cavity for 
receiving a quantity of moulding material. 
For exerting pressure on the moulding material in 
the recesses a plunger which is driven by means of an 

electromotor, a screwed rod and a nut arranged on the 
screwed rod is used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an single-strip moulding apparatus in accordance with the
preamble of claim 1.Such a moulding apparatus is disclosed in US patent 4.723.899. This patent discloses a
moulding apparatus for enclosing semi-conductor chips with resin. The mould is
provided with recesses for receiving the lead frames and in addition cavities are
arranged in the mould wherein measured quantities of moulding material can be placed.
By supplying heat and exerting pressure in these cavities with plungers the moulding
material becomes liquid, moves via channels to the recesses for receiving the lead
frames and, curing there, encapsulates the lead frames. The plungers are carried by a
holder which is vertically slidable in guide supports. Movement of the holder can for
example be operated by hydraulic means. Such a moulding apparatus has the drawbacks
in that it requires a very complex constructure, the moulding apparatus is difficult to
operate in clean surroundings and that the moulding process is difficult to control.The object of the invention is to provide a single-strip moulding apparatus which solves
the drawbacks of the existing moulding apparatuses and which combines a simple
construction with a relatively high production rate.This is achieved according to the invention by providing a single-strip moulding
apparatus according claim 1.Particular embodiments of the invention are the subject of the dependent claims. Driving has taken place
to date in the usual manner with hydraulic means, which
however entails various drawbacks. Hydraulic driving
requires cooling and is not otherwise well compatible with
the clean surroundings in which the process must take place.
There has further been the drawback that there was no direct
proportional relation between the exerted hydraulic pressure
and/or the controlled volume flow of the hydraulic oil and
the displacement speed of the plunger. The pressure-raising
process was difficult to control. Using the electro-mechanical
driving a direct relation is achieved between the
action of the electromotor and the displacement speed of the
plunger and/or the force to be exerted by the plunger on the
moulding material by converting the rotation movement of the
electromotor into a linear movement of the plunger rod using
the nut and the screwed rod. An electromotor moreover does
not pollute the surrounding area which befits the
cleanliness required of the area wherein the process takes
place. In addition the energy consumption of a hydraulic
plunger drive is much greater
