<ABSTRACT>
Process for the deposition of a thin layer of silica on a substrate by chemical reaction assisted by a plasma generated in a plasma reactor (1), the substrate being placed in a vacuum vessel (5). The succession of the following steps is carried out: introduction of oxygen and optionally of argon into the vacuum vessel, initiation of the plasma, introduction of silane into the vacuum vessel, the pressure of the gases in the vacuum vessel during the deposition between 40 and 80  mu bar, the flow rate of argon being between 0 and 35 cm
