<ABSTRACT>
A constant velocity ratio universal tripod joint (300) comprises on
each tripod arm (327) a glider (331) having flat surfaces (335a,335b)

and spherical surfaces (337a,337b) all contacting internal surfaces
(336a,336b,338a,338b) of a holder (334) whose external faces (340a,340b)

parallel to the axis of rotation have grooves (342a-342d) receiving
balls (346a-346d) in a retainer (352), the balls engaging the races

(322a,322b) of the joint outer member (312).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a constant velocity
universal joint according to the pre-characterizing part of claim 1. The
joint is to be used, for example, for a driving force-transmitting
section of an automobile.A universal joint of this type is known from US-A 3,381,497.
It has gliding members with
recesses of curved sectional shape.A constant velocity universal joint has been hitherto
used for a driving force-transmitting section of an
automobile in order to transmit a rotary power or a torque
of a driving shaft to respective axles through a driven
shaft.A constant velocity universal joint concerning the
conventional technique is known, for example, as illustrated
in FIG. 11, in which three track grooves 2 are formed along
the axial direction on an inner surface of an outer wheel 1.
Leg shafts 4, which protrude in the radial direction, are
provided on a tripod member 3 which is arranged inside the
outer wheel 1. A spherical roller 6 is fitted rotatably and
slidably in the axial direction to an outer circumferential
surface of each of the leg shafts 4 via a plurality of
needle bearings 5. The spherical roller 6 is allowed to
engage with a roller guide surface 7 disposed on both sides
of the track groove 2.However, in the case of the constant velocity universal 
joint concerning the conventional technique as described
above, when a high load is applied in a state in which the
tripod member 3 is inclined by a predetermined angle with
respect to the axis of the outer wheel 1, then the force to
press the roller guide surface 7 by the spherical roller 6,
i.e., the surface pressure exerted on the roller guide
surface 7 is increased, because each of the spherical
rollers 6 linearly contacts with the roller guide surface 7
of the track groove 2. As a result, oil film breakage
occurs at the contact surface between the spherical roller 6
and the roller guide surface 7, and lubrication failure
occurs. Further, the following inconveniences take plate.
That is, the lubrication failure causes formation of small
holes on the surface of the spherical roller 6, i.e., so-called
pits are generated. In other cases, irregularities
are formed on the surface of the spherical roller 6, i.e.,
so-called adhesive wear occurs.On the other hand, in the case of the constant velocity
universal joint concerning the conventional technique as
described above, when the tripod member 3 is inclined by a
predetermined angle with respect to the axis of the outer
wheel 1, a relationship is given as shown in FIG. 12, in
which each of
