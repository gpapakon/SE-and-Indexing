<ABSTRACT>
A water-dilutable coating, a process for producing the same and its use are disclosed. The coating contains: A) 40 to 95 % by weight of a OH group-containing, film-forming, saturated or unsaturated polyester which may be modified by fatty acids, or a mixture of such polyesters, available as aqueous dispersion. The polyester or said mixture have in average a hydroxyl number from 20 to 200, a numeric average of the molar mass (Mn) from 500 to 100,000 and a content of acid functionalities lower than 80 mEqu and/or a content of ethylene oxide units lower than 150 mEqu, in both cases with respect to 100 g solid resin. When acid functionalities and ethylene oxide units are both available, the sum of acid functionalities and ethylene oxide units is comprised between 1 and 200 mEqu, and the acid functionalities are if required at least partially neutralised. The coating also contains: B) 60 to 5 % by weight of one or several polyisocyanates with more than one free isocyanate group which are liquid at room temperature, if required by admixture of one or several organic solvents; and C) if required one or several additional binders, usual pigments, fillers and/or lacquer-usual additives and auxiliary substances. The percentages by weight of (A) and (B) relate to the solid resin content and add up to 100 % by weight.
