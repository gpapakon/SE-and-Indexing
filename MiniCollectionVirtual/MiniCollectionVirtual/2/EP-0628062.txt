<ABSTRACT>
An isotropic, biaxially stretched polyimide film prepared by casting a solution of a polyamic acid precursor in an organic solvent containing a cyclization catalyst and dehydrating agent onto the surface of a support, imidizing the polyamic acid to give a continuous self-supporting gel film containing 5-50 % by weight of solids, stretching the gel film in the machine direction (MD) at a ratio of 1.1-1.9, and stretching in the transverse direction (TD) with respect to the machine direction so as to maintain a TD/MD stretch ratio of from 0.9 to 1.3.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
process for the manufacture of a
polyimide film
for use as a support for electrical circuit boards to
which a metal layer is either laminated or deposited.
Specifically,
it relates to a process for the manufacture of a biaxially stretched polyimide film
having excellent dynamic properties and in-plane
isotropy, as well as improved dimensional stability.Due to its high heat resistance and good electrical
insulation properties, polyimide film can be used as an
electrical insulation material in a broad range of
industrial applications which require heat resistance.
More particularly, polyimide film can be used as a
support for an electrical circuit board to which a metal
layer is subsequently laminated or deposited and wherein
an electrical part, such as an IC chip, can be soldered
to the metal layer, thereby miniaturizing the electrical
wiring. An electrical circuit board having a polyimide
film support can also be folded to form a long
continuous electrical circuit board to such an extent
that polyimide film has come to occupy an important
position as a support for electrical insulation
applications. However, due to the diversification in
the applications of electrical circuit boards and the
increased density in the number of wirings, the
polyimide film requires improvements in dynamic
properties, in-plane isotropy, and dimensional stability 
for use as an electrical insulation support. In order
to meet these requirements prior art proposals have been
made based on improving physical properties of the
polyimide film by stretching or by improving dimensional
stability by the use of a copolyimide, or the like.For example, Japanese Patent Application
Publication Kokai 63-297029, discloses a process for
improving the dynamic properties of an aromatic
polyimide shaped article, comprising cyclizing and
imidizing a solution of an aromatic polyamic acid in an
organic polar solvent containing an imidization agent,
shaping to give a self-supporting shaped article
containing 20-87% by weight of volatile solvent and
stretching the shaped article at a stretch ratio of at
least 1.3 and heat-treating the stretched article at a
temperature of at least 150째C. The prior art process
improves dimensional stability in the stretching
direction, but it adversely affects not only the
dimensional stability in the direction perpendicular to
the stretching direction, but also the dynamic property
of in-plane anisotropy.Japanese Patent Application Publication Kokai 44-20878,

A process for the manufacture of a polyimide film
comprising the steps of:


(a) casting a solution of a polyamic acid precursor of
the polyimide in an organic solvent containing a cyclization

catalyst and a dehydrating agent onto a surface
of a suppo

(c) stretching said gel film at a stretch ratio of
from 1.1-1.9 in the machine direction (MD) wherein the

stretching rate is controlled using a tension isolation
means comprising nip rolls having a gripping

force of from 50 to 1000 kg/m; and
(d) stretching said gel film in the transverse direction
(TD) with respect to the machine direction (MD)

so as to maintain a TD/MD stretch ratio of from 1.0 to
1.3; and
(e) heating the biaxially stretched gel film at a temperature
of from 350 to 500 째C to completely imidize

the gel film to the polyimide.

is stretched simultaneously in both the machine (MD) and

transverse (TD) directions.
The process of claim 1 wherein the polyimide is derived

acid dianhydride and at least one aromatic diamine.
The process of claim 3 wherein the aromatic tetracarboxylic
acid dianhydride is pyromellitic dianhydride and the

aromatic diamine is 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl ether.
