Process for the production of products having 
bacterial activity and capable of converting glycerol 

into 1,3-propanediol, said process comprising the 
steps of 


(a) preculturing anaerobic populations, derived 
from anaerobic microbial habitats, said preculture 

being carried out under anaerobic conditions on a 
buffered nutrient medium containing glycerol as the 

sole carbon source, 
(b) isolating the active microbial precultures 
capable of fermenting glycerol, 
(c) enriching said precultures by discontinuous 
fermentation in an anaerobic reactor, on a nutrient 

medium based on glycerol as substrate and at 
controlled pH, 
(d) isolating the products having bacterial 
activity and capable of converting glycerol into 1,3-propanediol. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that by way of anaerobic microbial habitats can be 

used anaerobic digesters, for example for effluents 
from distilleries, agroindustries, or anaerobic media 

such as sediments and muds from effluent receiving 
sites. 
Process according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the pH is controlled to between 

5 and 8, and preferably between 6 and 7.5. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the isolation of the strains 

constituent of the products having a bacterial 
activity is carried out by removing samples under 

anaerobic conditions, with dilution of the 
populations, then spreading onto Petri dishes on agar 

culture media, under anaerobic conditions.  
 
Products having bacterial activity and capable 
of converting glycerol into 1,3-propanediol, able to 

be produced by the process according to any one of 
claims 1 to 4. 
Products according to claim 5, comprising the 
bacteria Enterobacter agglomerans, Clostridium 

butyricum, or Citrobacter amalonaticus, in the form of 
mixed cultures of anaerobic ecosystems. 
Products according to claims 5 or 6 consisting 
of bacteria belonging to the species Enterobacter 

agglomerans. 
Enterobacter agglomerans strain, registered at 
the CNCM under the N°I-1210. 
Clostridium butyricum strain, registered at 
the CNCM under the N°I-1211. 
Citrobacter amalonaticus strain, registered 
at the CNCM under the N°I-1212. 
Application of the products, species and 
strains having bacterial activity according to any one 

of claims 5 to 10, to the conversion of glycerol into 
1,3-propanediol by fermentation. 
Application according to claim 11, according 
to which the species Enterobacter agglomerans, and in 

particular the strain I-1210 of Enterobacter 
agglomerans, is used, the conversion of glycerol into 

1,3-propanediol being carried out under anaerobic 
conditions with control and regulation of the pH to 

between 6 and 7.5 and preferably at pH 7, in a 
temperature range of between approximately 28 and 

40°C. 
Application according to claim 11, in which 
Clostridium butyricum strain I-1211 is used, the 

conversion of glycerol into 1,3-propanediol being 
carried out under anaerobic conditions, with control 

of the pH to between 5 and 8, and preferably between 6 
and 7.5, and at a temperature between 32 and 40°C.  

 
Application according to claim 11, in which a 
mixed anaerobic bacterial population is used, in 

particular a bacterial population containing the 
species Enterobacter agglomerans and Clostridium 

butyricum and/or the strains Clostridium butyricum I-1211 
and Enterobacter agglomerans I-1210. 
Application of products having bacterial 
activity according to claim 5, comprising mixed 

bacterial populations which ferment glycerol and 
produce 1,3-propanediol, said populations in 

particular containing Citrobacter amalonaticus strain 
1212 according to claim 10.
