<ABSTRACT>
A resin-sealed semiconductor device includes a 
heat sink (20) on which a semiconductor chip (28) is 

provided. An output terminal (30) is connected to 
the semiconductor chip (28). A casing (22) 

surrounds the chip (28) and output terminals (30). 
Inside the casing (22), a sealing resin (32) 

containing an aggregate (34) such as glass particles 
is filled. The chip (28) is mounted in an area of 

an upper surface (21) of the heat sink (20) and the 
remaining area is covered with an epoxy resin film 

(40) of from 10 µm to 20 µm. The resin film (40) 
increases the bond strength between the sealing 

resin (32) and the heat sink (20) and prevents the 
occurrence of peeling of the sealing resin (32) from 

the heat sink (20) upon heat cycles due to 
difference in expansion coefficient.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a resin-sealed
semiconductor device for diodes, thyristors,
transistor modules, etc.Figs. 1 to 3 show a conventional resin-sealed
semiconductor device. More specifically, Fig. 1 is
a cross-sectional view of a conventional resin-sealed
semiconductor device. Fig. 2 is a
perspective view showing the conventional resin-sealed
semiconductor device shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 3
is an enlarged partial, cross-sectional view showing
the conventional resin-sealed semiconductor device
shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, 20 is a metal heat
sink, 22 is a casing made of a resin and connected
to the heat sink 20 with an adhesive. On the heat
sink 20, there are provided two insulators 24, each
of which has metalized surfaces, and conductor
layers or patterns 26 formed on the metalized
insulators, respectively, so that there are two
"islands" each consisting of the insulator 24 and
the conductor layer 26 superimposed one on another.
A semiconductor chip 28 is mounted on each island.
That is, the semiconductor chips 28 are mounted, via
the insulators 24 and the conductor layers 26, on
the heat sink 20 side by side at a certain distance
from each other. The chips 28 are welded to the 
conductor layer 26. An upper electrode 30 is
connected to each of the semiconductor chips 28, and
an output terminal 31 is connected to the conductor
layers 26. The upper electrodes 30 and the output
terminal 31 extend outward through holes provided in
an upper wall 22A of the casing 22. A sealing resin
32 such as an epoxy resin that contains an aggregate
34 such as quartz particles the cavity fills an
inner cavity defined by the casing 22. The
aggregate 34 is added to the sealing resin 32 in
order to reduce its amount as well as to increase
its strength after its hardening.In a resin-sealed semiconductor device having
such a structure as described above, the sealing
resin 32 tends to peel off from the heat sink 20 to
form a gap therebetween. The gap formation causes
various troubles and defects.More particularly, as shown in Fig. 2, an
increase in the temperature of the semiconductor
device when it is heated, for example, in a heat
cycle test will bring about a displacement of the
heat sink 20, which generally has a thickness of
about 3 mm, the displacement being in the direction
indicated by an arrow P in a broken line in an X-Y
plane defined in an imaginary X-Y-Z space. On the
other hand, the sealing resin 32 filled in the
cavity in the casing 22 has a coefficient of thermal
expansion different from that of the metal
