<ABSTRACT>
A method of amplifying a target sequence in a 
sample containing nucleic acid is provided which 

comprises hybridizing to the target sequence a first 
nucleic acid primer including a promoter sequence, 

extending the primer in a polymerase extension 
reaction complementarily to the target sequence to 

form a duplex, rendering the duplex single stranded, 
hybridizing to the extension product containing the 

promoter a second primer and carrying out a second 
extension reaction, and employing the second duplex 

as a template for the production of a plurality of 
RNA transcripts, the method being characterised in 

that the first and/or second primer includes a 
sequence necessary to allow the RNA product to be 

replicated by replicase induction and in that the RNA 
transcripts are so replicated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to advances
in molecular biology and molecular genetics.More particularly, the present invention relates to
novel methods containing requisite reagents and
means for increasing the in vitro or x-vivo copy number
of, i.e., amplifying, at least one selected segment
(sequence) of nucleic acid or its complement or
hybridizing homologous segment, in a sample comprising one
or more nucleic acids, which may include RNA, DNA or both.Among the applications in which the methods
of this invention find utility are 1) in analyses of
body fluids and tissues for the detection of specific
nucleic acid sequences characteristic of a genetic or
pathogenic disease or condition by in vitro or x-vivo
nucleic acid probe hybridization assays and 2) in the
selective cloning of single-copy or rare or low-expression
genes.Much of the work in molecular biology, molecular
genetics and applications thereof, such as for example,
nucleic acid probe hybridization assays for blood-borne
pathogens or defective genes, involves the detection or
isolation of a particular nucleic acid sequence. A 
fundamental problem in such work is to detect or isolate
and then quantitate a nucleic acid sequence of interest.
The problem has been a difficult one because biological
materials, such as cell cultures, tissue specimens, and
blood samples, typically are comprised of a complex
mixture of RNA and DNA entities of which at most only a
minuscule fraction has a sequence of interest.Indeed, practical applications of nucleic acid
probe hybridization assays have been limited because the
sensitivity of the assays, when carried out with reagents
suitable for routine use and over acceptably short time
periods, is too low to detect sequences of interest at the
low concentration at which they occur in real samples.Two fundamentally different approaches have been
taken to address the problem of detecting a nucleic acid
sequence of interest ("target segment") present at a low
level in a complex mixture of nucleic acids.In the first approach, the amount of nucleic acid
(including the target segment) in a sample is not altered;
instead, a signal-generating system is associated with the
target segment and produces a detectable signal
representative of the number of molecules of target
segment. For example, a nucleic acid probe, with a
sequence complementary to that of a subsegment of the
target segment is linked to an enzyme such as alkaline
phosphatase and is mixed with sample under hybridization
conditions that will effect
