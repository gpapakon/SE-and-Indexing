<ABSTRACT>
According to the procedure, a bottle (1) to be tested is filled with compressed air and, after a settling time, the amount of air which is leaving the bottle is tested using a flow sensor (9). If the air leaving the bottle lies within a predetermined range, it is concluded that the bottle (1) has no leak. If the air quantity is above a predetermined range, it can be concluded that the bottle suffers from a leak. The procedure results in a rapid detection even of small leaks, which makes the procedure suitable for the industrial testing of bottles.
