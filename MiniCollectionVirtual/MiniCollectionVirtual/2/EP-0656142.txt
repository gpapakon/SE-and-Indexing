<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for processing visual data is comprised of a first storage means for storing a first bit plane of visual data in a first format. A graphics controller is coupled to the first storage means by a data bus and through a storage bus. Means for receiving a second storage means for storing a second bit plane of visual data in a second format different from the first format is also provided. The receiving means is adapted to couple a second storage means to the graphics controller by a data bus and through a storage bus. Means for forming a merged pixel stream from visual data stored on the first and second storage means are also included. Means, coupled to the graphics controller, are provided for displaying the merged pixel stream. In a further embodiment, an apparatus for processing visual data is comprised of a first storage means for storing a first bit plane of visual data in a first format. A graphics controller is coupled to the first storage means by a data bus and through a storage bus. A second storage means coupled to the graphics controller by a data bus and through a storage bus is provided for storing a second bit plane of visual data in a second format different from the first format. Means for forming a merged pixel stream from visual data stored on the first and second storage means are also included. Means, coupled to the graphics controller, are provided for displaying the merged pixel stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to video signal processing
generally and particularly to systems for providing a
digital signal representative of video and graphics
information.The goal of attaining an integrated video/graphics
system (Integrated Visual Architecture) requires a system
architect to balance often conflicting requirements of video
subsystems and graphics subsystems. For example, while
increasing horizontal and vertical resolution is beneficial
to graphics images, in digital video subsystems increasing
horizontal and vertical resolution can actually be
detrimental to the overall image quality. Likewise, in
graphics subsystems, the pixel depth, i.e. the number of
simultaneous colors available, is not as important as it is
for video systems. While it may be hard to justify the
additional system cost of 16 bit, near-true-color pixels for
the graphics system, a video system can arguably make use of
deeper 24 bit pixels.The performance budget of a video processor in a
digital video subsystem during playback is divided and used
to perform two tasks: creating the video image from a
compressed data stream and copying/scaling the image to the
display buffer. The performance budget of the video
subsystem must be balanced between the copy/scale operation
and the video decompression operation. Both operations must 
get performed thirty times a second for smooth, natural
motion video. The division of the performance budget is
usually done to worse case which results in an allocation of
sufficient performance for a full screen motion video
copy/scale operation with the remaining performance being
dedicated to the video decompression operation. If the
number of pixels (and/or bytes) that have to be written in
the copy/scale operation are increased, the performance of
the video decompression necessarily decreases. In ever
increasing resolutions, for a given level of video
technology, a point will be reached where the video image
starts to degrade because the information content in the
decompressed image is too low. Increasing the resolution
beyond this point would be analogous to playing back a poor
copy of a VHS tape on the most expensive, highest-quality TV
available; the TV would reproduce the low-quality images
perfectly.Several formats have been presented for storing
pixel data in a video subsystem. One approach is to simply
have 24 bits of RGB information per pixel. This approach
yields the maximum color space required for video at the
expense of three bytes per pixel. Depending on the number
of pixels in the
