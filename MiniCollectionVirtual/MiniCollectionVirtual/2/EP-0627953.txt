<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved apparatus and
method for purifying a fluid product by removing certain
components of a fluid mixture or contaminants from a source
of a single fluid.Since this invention is effective in
separation of gases and liquids, depending on
circumstances, the term fluid will be used as much as
possible. It is understood that the term includes gases and
liquids. Although focus is directed to the medical use as
a respiratory support in the present embodiment, this
invention is also useful in other situations where zeolites
and sieve materials are employed, for example oil refinery
procedures.The use of selectively adsorbent molecular sieve
materials having uniform pore sizes in separation of fluid
components has been in practice since about 1948, with the
first industrial research efforts occurring at Union
Carbide Corporation. Based on the first experimental
observations of the adsorption of gases on naturally
occurring zeolites and the behavior of the latter as
molecular sieves by Barrer in 1945 (J. Soc. Chem. Ind.,
64:130), Milton and coworkers at Union Carbide synthesized
the first industrial zeolite molecular sieves in 1948 (R.M. 
Milton, Molecular Sieves, Soc. Chem. Ind., London, 1968, p.
199), and they were test marketed in 1954.Most separations of fluid mixtures by adsorption
require regeneration of the adsorbent after saturation with
the adsorbate. Since most separations are performed on
fixed-bed columns, complex mechanisms involving intricate
networks of interconnected and interoperating valves and
switches have been devised to implement adsorption and
desorption cycles in order to facilitate regeneration.Costly and elaborate equipment like that described
above is suitable for large scale commercial operations
where the equipment is constantly monitored by competent
technicians. However, in dealing with the problem of
supplying relatively small quantities of oxygen to
patients, especially at home, size, ease of operation and,
even more importantly, reliability are the primary
concerns.The use of synthetic molecular sieves in a two-bed,
pressure swing adsorber for separation of oxygen from air
for medical and industrial applications became commercially
practical in the early 1970's and many manufacturers now
build such equipment.The components in a typical two column system
currently available are:
Air compressorHeat exchangerAir receiver or surge tankTwo molecular sieve chambersTwo pressure dropping orificesProduct tank (oxygen receiver)Four or five two-way solenoid
