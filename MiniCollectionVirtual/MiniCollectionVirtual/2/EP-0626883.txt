<ABSTRACT>
A reactor assembly is provided for destroying contaminants in fluids by the application of UV radiation to promote the destruction of the contaminants. The reactor assembly (10) has a vertically orientated reactor chamber (12) with a centrally located lamp (16) emitting UV radiation and operating at temperatures in excess of 700  DEG C. A protective sheath (18) transparent to the UV radiation encloses the lamp (16) and isolates the lamp (16) from reactor interior to define thereby an annular reactor space (20) through which fluids to be treated flow. The fluids flowing through the annular reactor space (20) and along the sheath (18) effect a cooling of the sheath (18) due to lamp heating. The lamp (16) has a terminal portion at each end thereof. Each terminal portion has a temperature sensitive component. The lamp (16) is of a sufficient length to extend the terminals beyond the end portions of the reactor (12) which has a length equal to or greater than the arc length of the lamp (16). Cooling air is directed on to each of the upper and lower terminals of the lamp (16) to cool the temperature sensitive portions thereby preventing deterioration of each lamp end due to excessive heating. In directing cooling air onto the lower terminal a pressure is developed which is greater than the pressure at the upper end of the sheath (18) so that a controlled constant flow of cooling air is assured upwardly of the sheath (18) and over the lamp (16). This constant flow of cooling air is controlled to permit the lamp (16) to operate at optimum operating temperatures to provide the necessary output of UV radiation to promote the destruction of the contaminants in the fluids.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for 
decontaminating a fluid which involves the application 
of UV radiation to said fluid. More particularly, the 
method uses a UV emitting lamp which operates at high 
temperatures normally in excess of 300°C. Ultraviolet radiation is an important workhorse in 
the industrial community for promoting chemical 
reactions, initiating chemical reactions, degrading 
organic and non-organic molecules, inducing mutations in 
biological systems, acting as an antiviral and 
bactericidal agent and the like. Normally the source of 
the ultraviolet radiation is emitted from an electric 
discharge lamp having various types of gases which when 
excited by the electric discharge, emit UV radiation. 
These lamps are generally categorized as low or 
medium/high intensity lamps. They may operate at low or 
high pressures for the gases within the lamps. Normally 
the lamps are of a quartz material which is transparent 
to the emitted UV radiation. The lamps may operate at 
low or high temperatures ranging from approximately 30°C 
up to 1100°C. The power input of these lamps may range 
from less than 40 watts to in excess of 60,000 watts for 
developing watts of UV radiation. The lamps may be even 
customized to the extent that a certain portion of the UV 
spectrum is omitted or enhanced rather than the entire 
portion of the UV spectrum. A driving force for such variety in UV lamps is that 
each of the above industrial applications requires lamps 
having different UV intensities, different wavelength of 
emission, operating pressure and temperatures and power 
requirements. Normally the lamps, as employed in reactor systems, 
particularly reactor systems which contain aqueous media,  
 
have a variety of UV transparent protective sheaths 
within which the lamps are placed so that the lamps do 
not come in contact with the material being treated by 
the UV radiation. This technique protects the quartz of 
the UV lamp and the electrical connections to the lamp 
electrodes. Also it can facilitate lamp replacement 
without having to disassemble the reactor. Another general approach for exposing fluids to UV 
radiation to initiate or expedite a desired chemical 
reaction within the fluids is to position a plurality of 
UV lamps around a reaction container having a vessel wall 
which is transparent to the UV radiation. This permits 
radiation emitted by the lamps to pass through the vessel 
walls and be absorbed by the fluids within the reaction 
container so as to initiate or expedite the

A method for decontaminating a fluid which 
involves the application of UV radiation to said fluid, 

said UV radiation being produced by a lamp operating at 
temperatures in excess of 300°C, said method 

comprising: 

i) passing said fluid to be treated through a 
vertically oriented cylindrical reactor chamber (20) 

with said UV lamp (16) extending along said chamber 
(20) and located centrally thereof, said lamp being 

isolated from said chamber by an enclosing cylindrical 
sheath (18) which is transparent to said UV radiation, 

said sheath being larger than said lamp to provide an 
annular space (78) between said lamp (16) and sheath 

(18), said reactor chamber having a reactor length 
which is equal to or greater than an arc length for 

said lamp, respective lamp terminal ends (66,70) being 
positioned exterior of respective ends of said sheath 

(18) with temperature sensitive portions (166) of each 
terminal exposed beyond said sheath ends, 
ii) passing cooling air over respective terminal 
ends (66,70) of said lamp to cool said temperature 

sensitive portions (166) and thereby prevent 
deterioration of each lamp end due to excess heating 

during lamp operation, and 
iii) developing a constant cooling air pressure 
differential between the sheath upper end and the 

sheath lower end to provide a cooling air pressure at 
the lower end of said sheath which exceeds a cooling 

air pressure at the upper end of said sheath to ensure 
a constant upward flow of air along said annular space 

(78) within said sheath (18) to provide thereby 
additional cooling for, and prevent overheating of, 

said lamp during operation at temperatures in excess of 
300°C, the constant upward flow of air being controlled 

to avoid overcooling of said lamp. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said 
reactor chamber is annular in cross section, annular 

ring baffles (30) being positioned in said annular 
reactor chamber along its length, said baffles (30) 

being spaced apart along said reactor chamber length, 
each baffle ring contacting reactor chamber exterior 

shell and having its inner portion spaced from said 
sheath to define thereby a plurality of serially 

arranged annular reactor compartments
 
   said fluids being passed upwardly through said 

reactor whereby said baffles (30) direct flow of fluids 
inwardly and outwardly relative to said sheath (18) as 

fluids flow from one annular reactor compartment to the 
next annular reactor compartment. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
wherein cooling air is passed over the upper terminal 

end (66) of the lamp (16) through an enclosing means 
(96), for enclosing the open upper end (66) of said 

sheath (18) to preclude direct eye exposure to UV 
radiation, and is exhausted from said enclosing means 

(96) through a vent (102), the step of directing 
cooling air through said enclosing means (96) 

developing a back pressure of air therein, and wherein 
cooling air is passed over the lower terminal end (70) 

to develop a pressure at the lower end of said sheath 
(18) which exceeds the air back pressure in said 

enclosing means (96). 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein cooling air is passed over the upper terminal 

end (66) independently of cooling air passed over the 
lower lamp terminal (70). 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, 
further comprising blocking UV radiation and heat 

emitted by said lamp (16) by means of a temperature - 
and UV-resistant collar (198) provided at each sheath
