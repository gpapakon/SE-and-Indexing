<ABSTRACT>
Assembly for supporting a submaxillary denture on a lower jaw, 
comprising a base plate (2), which has the form of a curved strip, a 

bridge member (12) on which the submaxillary denture is to be placed, a 
set of columns (3-6) which are provided with threaded bores in which 

fixing screws (35) fit to connect the columns with the base plate, and 
which are connected with the bridge member in order to allow the base 

plate to support this bridge member, a set of cortical screws (7-11) for 
securing the base plate to the lower jawbone, the base plate being 

provided with first holes (100) for receiving the fixing screws for 
fixing the columns to the base plate and second holes (101) for 

receiving the cortical screws, the first holes being formed as elongated 
holes (27), the main axis thereof extending substantially transversely 

to the principal direction of extension of the strip-formed base plate 
and the longitudinal boundaries of the elongated holes being curved 

convexly in a plane parallel to the longitudinal plane of symmetry of 
the elongated holes, and the fixing screws having a concave head which 

projects relative to the longitudinal boundaries of the respective 
elongated hole and is formed complementary thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an assembly for supporting a
mandibular denture on a lower jaw as described in the preamble of
claim 1.Such an assembly can be seen as a solution to the problem
that a mandibular denture has to be repeatedly adapted
to the form of the upper side of the lower jaw, which form
changes due to the reduction of the lower jaw body. This
reduction is caused, among other things, by the pressure
which the denture exerts on the bone tissue, in particular
when biting and chewing.An assembly of the type mentioned in the preamble of claim 1
is known from the European Patent 110.462 in the name of
Applicant, by means of which a reduction of the exerted
pressure to below the critical value is brought about, by
converting at least part of the chew and bite forces into
a pulling force exerted on the periosteum. For this purpose
the assembly comprises a base plate, which has the
form of a curved strip, a bridge member, on which the
submaxillary venture is to be placed, a set of columns
which are connected to the base plate and to the bridge
member in order to allow the base plate to support this
bridge member and are fixed onto the base plate with a
separate screw which reaches from the apical side through
an elongated hole in the base plate intended for that
purpose, in order to pull the column, which is provided
with a mating threaded bore, against the base plate, and a
set of cortical screws for securing the base plate to the 
lower jawbone, on both sides of the columns. The columns
which are preferably provided with a cortical thread
reduce the pressure force exerted on the bone by also
transferring it to the cortical screws, which results in a
pulling force on the periosteum laid back over the base
plate. The external thread present on the column directly
transfers part of the exerted pressure force to the bone
tissue, whilst, however, applying pressure which is below
the critical value. The other part of the exerted pressure
force is converted into a pull force on the periosteum
through the sufficiently rigid base plate.Although this known assembly in general appears to work
very satisfactorily in practise, situations can arise in
which an optimal operation is not feasible.As people get older the lower jawbone, which initially has
a rounded-off L-form in cross section, will decrease in
height and breadth. This can result in the columns, which
project substantially vertically through the lying bone
not being able to get sufficient length of engagement. Indeed,
in the known assembly, in which

Assembly for supporting a mandibular denture on a
lower jaw, comprising a base plate (2), which has the form of

a curved strip, a bridge member (12) on which the submaxillary
denture is to be placed, a set of columns (3-6) which are provided

with threaded bores (39) in which fixing screws (35) fit to
connect the columns with the base plate, and which are

connected with the bridge member in order to allow the
base plate to support this bridge member, a set of cortical

screws (7-11) for securing the base plate to the lower
jawbone, the base plate being provided with first holes (100)

for receiving the fixing screws for fixing the columns to
the base plate and second holes (101) for receiving the cortical

to the principal direction of extension of the strip-formed
base plate

and the fixing screws having a head which projects relative to

the longitudinal boundaries of the respective elongated hole,
characterized in that

the longitudinal boundaries (31) of the
elongated holes (100) are curved in a plane parallel to the

longitudinal plane of symmetry of the elongated holes.
Assembly according to claim 1, in which the longitudinal
boundaries (31) of the elongated holes (100) are convex in the

apical surface of the base plate (2).
Assembly according to claim 1 or 2, in which the transverse
boundaries (27, 28) of the elongated holes (100) are curved in a

plane substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal
plane of symmetry of the elongated holes, having a similar

sign as the longitudinal boundaries (31) of the elongated
holes.
