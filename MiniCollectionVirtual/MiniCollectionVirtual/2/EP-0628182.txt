Method for the monitoring and control of batch 
processes which contain a plurality of process steps 

which take place successively with a formulation-specific 
time interval and whose initial states are characterized 

by a set of specific parameters, the batch processes 
being controlled by means of an automatic process control, 

characterized in that a phase (time-program module) 
is integrated into the process-control system, which 

phase contains 

a) the process-specific events in the form of their 
parameter constellation, 
b) the time sequence of the process-specific events, 
c) the precise process-specific time intervals between 
the events, 
 
the phase (time-program module) 


1) with the start of the formulation program or after 
the recognition of a process-specific event, 

starting a new, relative time axis in each case, 
2) by integration of the phases of the formulation 
program into the parameter set, initiating the 

process steps to achieve the particular next process-specific 
successive event, 
3) after expiry of the process-specific time interval 
until the successive event, comparing the specific 

parameter constellation for the start of the 
successive event with the current parameter 

constellation in the process and 
4) in the case of agreement of the parameter constellations, 
initiating the process steps to achieve the 

particular next successive event. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that deviation tolerances, permitted for the precise 

process-specific time intervals, from the precise time 
intervals are defined, within which deviation tolerances 

the characteristic successive event can occur. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the order of magnitude of the tolerable time 

deviations is programmed in by the operator or is  
 

ascertained by the process-control system itself using a 
statistical evaluation of the actual scatters of the time 

intervals. 
Method according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the time intervals determined by the 

process-control system and the scatters thereof are 
signalled to the operating/monitoring device of the 

process control and/or to an output device and are thus 
used for the monitoring and surveillance of the process 

constancy and thus of the product quality. 
Method according to Claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, characterized 
in that, in the case of deviations from the 

specified process flow in the batch process to be 
controlled, these deviations from the regular process 

flow are signalled to the operating/monitoring system and 
there is the possibility of manual intervention in the 

process control by the operating personnel.
