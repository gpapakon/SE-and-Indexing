<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a resin composition for cationic
electrocoating which contains a catalyst metal in an acetylide form, to a
process for producing the same, and to a cationic electrocoating
composition.Cationic electrocoating can provide substrates or coating target
articles with coatings every nook and cranny even when said substrates
are complicated in form or shape and can be performed automatically
and continuously. Therefore, it is in general use as a technique of
forming an undercoat on substrates, such as automotive bodies, which
have a large size and are complicated in form or shape and are required
to be highly resistant to corrosion. Furthermore, said technique is very
highly efficient from the coating composition consumption viewpoint,
hence economical, as compared with other methods of coating and,
therefore, it has come into wide use as an industrial method of coating.Cationic electrocoating is carried out by immersing a substrate,
which is to serve as a cathode, in a cationic electrocoating composition
and applying a voltage. The deposition of a coating layer on the
substrate involves electrochemical reaction and the coating layer that has
deposited on the substrate surface upon voltage application has an
insulating property. Therefore, with the progress of deposition of the
coating in the process of coating, hence with the increase in deposit layer
thickness, the electric resistance of the coating layer increases in
proportion to the increase in layer thickness. As a result, the
deposition of the coating composition at that site decreases and, instead,
the deposition of a coating layer on some other uncoated site begins.
In this way, the deposition of emulsion particles of the coating
composition takes place successively from uncoated site to uncoated site.
In the present specification, such successive formation of a coating on
uncoated sites of a substrate is referred to as "throwing power". Such cationic electrocoating is generally used in undercoat
formation, mainly for the purpose of rust prevention and, therefore, it is
required that even substrates having a complicated structure should be
provided with a coating having a certain predetermined film thickness at
any part thereof. For this reason, sufficient levels of throwing power
are to be secured.As a cationic electrocoating composition excellent in throwing
power, WO 98/03701 for instance discloses a cationic electrocoating
composition comprising a basic resin containing a triple bond such as an
ethynyl or nitrile
