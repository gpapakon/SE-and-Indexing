<ABSTRACT>
A voltage level sense circuit that has temperature 
compensation is disclosed. The circuit includes charge-sharing 

capacitors in each of an input leg and a reference leg. The 
charge-sharing capacitors are precharged to voltages that are 

integral multiples of the forward bias voltage drop across the 
base-emitter junction of a bipolar transistor. The bipolar 

transistors in the input leg differ from those in the reference 
leg, so that the difference in base-emitter on voltages 

increases with temperature. The increasing difference in base-emitter 
on voltage compensates for the decrease in the absolute 

value of the base-emitter on voltage with temperature. Voltage 
level sensing is accomplished by sampling the input voltage with 

a capacitor, charge-sharing the sampled voltage with one of the 
precharged charge-sharing capacitors, and coupling the charge-shared 

result to an input of a differential amplifier 
comparator. The second charge-sharing capacitor, after sharing 

its charge with another capacitor inserted for purposes of 
circuit matching, is coupled to the other input of the 

differential amplifier, and the comparison is performed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of integrated circuits, and
is more specifically directed to voltage level sense circuits.The performance of many modern electronic systems depends,
to a large degree, upon the stable operation of solid-state
integrated circuits in the system over a range of operating
conditions. A stability factor with which many in the art are
concerned is temperature stability, particularly the temperature
stability of circuit response to input signals. More
specifically, it is highly desirable that digital integrated
circuits have stable switching characteristics over the expected
temperature range, particularly in having a constant trip point
voltage over temperature.The integration of a large number of circuit elements onto
a single integrated circuit "chip" has greatly improved circuit
performance, due to the matching of device parameters obtained
as a result of the simultaneous manufacture of the circuit
elements on the same chip. Such matching reduces the
sensitivity of the circuit to shifts in manufacturing
parameters, as parameter variations will tend to similarly
affect circuit elements on the same chip. However, sensitivity
of circuit performance to manufacturing variability still
exists, especially in sensitive circuits such as those used to 
sense whether an input signal is above or below a selected trip
voltage.EP 0275548 describes a voltage comparator which uses a level
shifter to overcome- the problem of offset voltage changes in
accordance with changes in the surrounding atmosphere.By way of further background, one type of conventional circuit for
providing a stable reference voltage relative to an input
voltage is the so-called Widlar band-gap reference circuit, an
example of which is described in Gray, et al., Analysis and
Design of Analog Integrated Circuits (John Wiley & Sons, 1977,
1984), at pp. 289-296. This circuit produces an output voltage
that is equal to the Vbe(on) of a bipolar transistor plus a
voltage proportional to the difference between the forward bias
voltage drop across the base-emitter junction of two
transistors, and thus generates a relatively stable reference
voltage over temperature. Gray et al. also disclose an improved
band-gap reference circuit having reduced sensitivity to power
supply variations relative to the traditional Widlar circuit.
These band-gap circuits are generally used to provide a
temperature-insensitive reference voltage, for example as an
input to a voltage regulator circuit.It is an object of the present invention to provide
