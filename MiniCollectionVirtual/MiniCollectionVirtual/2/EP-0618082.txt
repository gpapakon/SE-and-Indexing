<ABSTRACT>
A heat sensitive recording material comprises a heat sensitive 
color forming layer containing a color former of a colorless or light color 

leuco dyestuff, a developer which develops color by the reaction with the 
color former by heating and is a mixture of 97 to 70 weight % of 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone 

and 3 to 30 weight % of 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone 
and a sensitizer. The heat sensitive color forming layer 

is coated on a support. The heat sensitive recording material has 
excellent color forming property by which sufficiently high concentration 

and sensitivity of the color forming are obtained and has excellent 
stability of the image with time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel heat sensitive recording
material. More particularly, it relates to a heat sensitive recording
material with enhanced color forming and image stability.Heat sensitive recording materials having a heat sensitive layer
which forms color by heating and is coated on a support, such as paper,
synthetic paper and plastic film, are widely used in thermal printers of
facsimiles, portable calculators, microcomputers and the like, in
thermo-pen recorders of cardiograph and analytical instruments, in
train tickets, in labels for POS at super markets and the like
applications.The heat sensitive recording materials are generally produced by
the following processes: a color former of a colorless or light color leuco
dyestuff, such as lactone dyestuffs, lactam dyestuffs and spiropyran
dyestuffs, and a developer which develops color by reaction with the color
former by heating are dispersed in a disperse medium separately after
each components have been pulverized with a ball mill or a sand mill;
these dispersions are mixed with addition of a binder to form a single
dispersion; a coating dispersion is prepared from this dispersion, when
necessary, with addition of a wax, a sensitizer, a surface active agent, a
defoaming agent, an inorganic pigment and the like; and the coating 
dispersion is coated on a support such as paper and dried to form the
heat sensitive color forming layer.As a developer having good image stability, 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone
and 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone are used in Laid
Open Japanese Patent Applications 1981-127486 and 1988-3991. However,
these compounds show inferior heat response and satisfactory
concentration of the color forming cannot be obtained. To overcome the
problem, a sensitizer is generally added to the developer to decrease the
temperature required for the color developing. As the sensitizer for this
purpose, paraffin wax, amides such as fatty acid amides, esters such as
dimethyl terephthalate and ethers are generally used. However, these
sensitizers do not have sufficient ability with respect to the concentration
and the sensitivity of the color forming and are not satisfactory because of
the problem that image stability is inferior even when an image of high
concentration of the color forming is obtained and the image is
deteriorated with passage of time.EP-A-251 209 discloses a thermal recording material comprising a base and a recording
layer thereon, whereby the recording layer comprises a 2,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone as
