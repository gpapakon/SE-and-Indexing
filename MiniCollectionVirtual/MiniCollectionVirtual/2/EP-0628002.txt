<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method are provided for forming a package with heat tack seals for a slice of a food item. A web of thermoplastic material is first formed into a tubular arrangement (21) with a longitudinal heat tack seal. To form the tubular arrangement (21), means (16) are provided for folding a continuous web of thermoplastic material into a tube and for continuously forming a heat seal along the longitudinal face of the folded web. The food item which has been formed into a soft mass, is then inserted into the tubular member and the tubular member is flattened to form a thin film tube. Means (30) are provided for forming a heat tack cross-seal which is disposed substantially transverse to the longitudinal forward moving direction of the web.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an 
apparatus and method for packaging food items and more 
particularly to an apparatus and process for packaging 
and stacking food items in individual slices having heat 
tack seals. Various methods and apparatus have been proposed 
and utilized for the manufacture and packaging of 
individual slices of food items such as cheese. Although 
the available apparatus and methods are suitable for the 
packaging of individual slices, they are not without disadvantages. One distinct apparatus and method is disclosed 
in U.S. Application Serial No. 07/791,490, filed on November 
12, 1991, whose disclosure is incorporated herein 
by reference. In Serial No. 07/791,490 the package for 
the individual slices is formed from a continuous film or 
web of a thermoplastic material. The web is first folded 
in V-folded condition. As used herein, the term V-folded 
condition refers to a length of material which has been 
folded over onto itself so as to form what may subsequently 
be identified as a front sheet and a rear sheet which 
are joined by the fold at the bottom, so as to approximate 
the letter "V" in cross section. The web is typically 
folded such that the rear sheet is longer than the 
front sheet to define a flap section in the rear sheet, 
which extends beyond the top edge of the front sheet.  
 
The flap section is typically folded over onto the front 
sheet to form a tubular web. For purposes of an example, the following description 
is given with processed cheese as the food item 
being wrapped. It will be appreciated that other items 
are within the scope of the invention. The food item, 
such as processed cheese, is inserted into the tube. 
The web and cheese are then flattened. Subsequently, 
cross-seals are formed transverse to the longitudinal 
length of the tubular web at predetermined intervals thus 
forming slices which are joined together. After the tube 
is cross-sealed it is severed along the cross-seals in 
order to produce individually wrapped slices of cheese. Several processes presently exist for providing 
the cross-seal. In one commonly used method, the transverse 
cross-seals are formed by subjecting the flattened 
web (with the inserted hot cheese) to pressure, at the 
desired locations. The pressure is applied such that an 
ultra-thin layer or film of cheese is left in the transverse 
sealing section. The ultra-thin layer or film of 
cheese acts as an adhesive to hold the two layers of the 
plastic web together. After this "cheese seal"
