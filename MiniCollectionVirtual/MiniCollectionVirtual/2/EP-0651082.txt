<ABSTRACT>
A weft feed gripper (1) wherein the gripper body (2) 
terminates with a hook (3), and presents a slider (4) for 

engaging the weft inside the hook (3), and control means (11) 
cooperating with a gripper opening element (10) on the loom, 

for selectively moving the slider between a first 
position adjacent to the hook and wherein it retains the 

weft, and a second position wherein the slider is 
detached from the hook to release the weft. The control 

means include a flexible leaf spring (19) with a first 
profile; a flexible strap (12) secured at opposite ends to 

the slider and the gripper body and mounted so as to 
slide inside the gripper body; and second profiles (18) on 

the gripper body; the strap sliding between the 
profiles, and being deformed elastically when the leaf 

spring cooperates with and is flexed by the gripper 
opening element, so as to move the slider between the 

first and second positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a weft feed
gripper for looms, and in particular to a controlled-weft-release
drawing gripper.As is known, on modern looms, the weft yarn is
inserted inside the shed, formed by the heddles, using a
carrying and a drawing gripper, which travel back and
forth inside the shed in a crosswise direction to the
warp yarns; the carrying gripper picking up the weft yarn
from the reel and carrying it roughly halfway along the
shed to the so-called "exchange point", and the drawing
gripper picking up the yarn from the carrying gripper at
the exchange point and drawing it to the end of the shed
where it is released from the drawing gripper.Pickup and release of the weft - at least release -
are controlled by the interaction of a fixed element or
"gripper opener" located along the path of the gripper in
question, usually the drawing gripper, and a movable or
"pressure" element on the gripper. To enable interaction 
of the two elements, known grippers, as e.g. that shown
in EP-A-0164628, are of complex design and, in
particular, feature elements pivoting on the gripper body
for interacting with the gripper opener.Due to the high speed - roughly 30 m/sec - at which
the gripper opener is contacted, the release mechanism
undergoes considerable mechanical shock seriously
impairing the reliability of the pivots. In more general
terms, as a consequence of the high output demanded of
modern looms, opening of the weft feed grippers for
pickup/release of the weft yarn is now a critical
operation in which the high operating speed and small
size of the grippers result in severe stress of the
gripper components. Moreover, known opening mechanisms
are invariably cumbersome and subject to severe wear.It is an object of the present invention to provide
a weft feed gripper opened and closed by means of known
"gripper opening" elements but designed to overcome the
aforementioned drawbacks, and which in particular
features a reliable, straightforward, low-cost, compact
opening mechanism.According to the present invention, there is
provided a weft feed gripper for looms, comprising a
gripper body terminating with a hook at one end; a slider
mounted in sliding manner on the gripper body and
presenting, towards the hook, a jaw for engaging the 
weft; and control means cooperating with a gripper opening element
on the loom, for selectively moving the slider between a first
position, wherein the jaw cooperates with the hook to retain the
weft yarn therein, and a second position, wherein the jaw is
detached

<CLAIMS>
A weft feed gripper (1) for looms, comprising a gripper body (2)
terminating with a hook (3) at one end; a slider (4) mounted in sliding manner

on the gripper body and presenting, towards the hook, a jaw (5) for engaging
the weft; and control means (11) cooperating with a gripper opening element

(10) on the loom, for selectively moving the slider (4) between a first position,
wherein the jaw (5) cooperates with the hook (3) to retain the weft yarn therein,

and a second position, wherein the jaw (5) is detached from the hook (3) to
release the weft yarn; said control means (11) comprising a flexible strap (12)

secured at one end to the slider (4) ;

   
characterized in that
 said control means (11) also comprise: first and
second pressure means (16,18) presenting mating profiles and fitted to the

gripper body (2) in parted manner and so as to move in relation to each other,
the first pressure means (16) cooperating with said gripper opening element

(10) so as to move towards the second pressure means (18); the flexible strap
(12) being secured at the opposite end to the gripper body (2), mounted in sliding manner between said first and second pressure

means (16,18), and being deformed elastically so as to reproduce said mating
profiles when said first and second pressure means (16,18) are mated; and said

mating profiles being so formed as to move the slider (4) between said first and
second positions.
A weft feed gripper as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that said
first pressure means (16) comprise a flexible leaf spring (19) fitted in projecting 

manner at a first end to the gripper body (2), and presenting at least a first
profiled element (23) at a second end opposite the first and on the face facing

said strap (12) and detached from the strap when the leaf spring (19) is
undeformed; the second pressure means (18) comprising at least a pair of

second profiled elements (26) mating with the first (23), integral with the
gripper body (2) on the side facing said leaf spring (19), and between which the
