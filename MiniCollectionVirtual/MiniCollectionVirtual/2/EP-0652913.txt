<ABSTRACT>
A method of preventing clogging of nozzles, particularly nozzle orifices in a drop-on-demand ink jet printers, during intervals when no ink flows through the nozzles, e.g. during non-printing intervals, when using an ink composition intended for recording permanent information on essentially non-absorbent surfaces. The ink composition is made up of a solvent, a non- or low-volatile fraction and a colorant. The relative quantities and solubility of the constituents are selected such that when printing terminates and a portion of the solvent evaporates at the nozzle orifice, a concentration of colorant and less volatile fraction builds up in the region of the nozzle orifice. This causes the colorant to migrate to an environment in which its affinity is greater, i.e. further within the nozzle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of preventing 
clogging of nozzles, particularly nozzle outlets in drop-on-demand 
ink jet printers, during intervals when no ink 
flows through the nozzles, e.g. during non-printing 
intervals, when using an ink intended for recording 
permanent information on essentially non-absorbent 
surfaces. There are at present two basic types of ink-jet printer on 
the market, i.e. continuous flow ink-jet printers and drop-on-demand 
ink-jet printers. In continuous flow printers, 
ink droplets are continuously emitted from a nozzle without 
regard as to whether or not a printing operation is 
performed. The ink droplets are charged in accordance with 
print information data and are deflected in response to the 
amount of charge carried thereon as they pass through a 
constant high-voltage field. The thus deflected ink 
droplets are deposited onto a recording surface whilst the 
ink droplets not contributive to the actual printing 
operation are directed towards a beam gutter for 
recirculation. Since the ink droplets flow continuously 
through the nozzle, the risk of ink drying out and clogging 
the nozzle does not arise. Of course, a portion of the 
solvent included within the ink liquid is unavoidably 
decreased due to volatilizing while the ink droplets travel 
through the air from the nozzle to the beam gutter, though 
this problem is normally addressed by monitoring the 
viscosity of the ink and adding solvent as required.  
 In drop-on-demand printers, the print head comprises a 
number of individual ink channels. In one type of drop-on-demand 
printer, the channels are supplied with ink under 
pressure and the ink is maintained within the channels by 
valves which open in response to print information. In a 
more recent development, these channels are formed in a 
piezoelectric wafer, and ink issuance is achieved by 
applying a voltage pulse to electrodes across each channel 
to cause a volume reduction of the channel, thereby 
expelling the ink within the channel. In this latter type 
of drop-on-demand printer, no valve componentry is required 
in the print head. In both types of drop-on-demand printer, 
when a certain character is to be generated on a recording 
surface, ink droplets are issued from those channels whose 
grouping forms the desired character. Thus, only those ink 
droplets which form the character are emitted. Because there is no continuous flow of ink through the 
nozzles in drop-on-demand printers, significant problems 
arise from the ink

<CLAIMS>
A method of preventing clogging of nozzles in ink 
jet printers during intervals when no ink flows through the 

nozzles, which comprises employing an ink composition 
intended for recording permanent information on essentially 

non-absorbent surfaces, said ink composition comprising: 

(a) at least one solvent; 
(b) a non-, or low volatile liquid or solution 
miscible to a certain extent in said at least 

one solvent (a), and 
(c) at least one colorant which is soluble and/or 
dispersible in a mixture of (a) and (b), but 

insoluble in (b) solely; 
 
the relative quantities of components (a), (b) and (c) 

being chosen such that when flow is terminated in the 
nozzles and a portion of component (a) evaporates, a 

concentration of components (b) and (c) builds up in the 
nozzles, thereby causing component (c) to migrate further 

within the nozzles into an environment in which its 
affinity is greater. 
The method according to claim 1, in which said 
component (a) is one or more high- or medium-volatile 

solvents which are at least partially miscible with each 
other, for example alcohols, ketones and esters. 
The method according to claim 2, in which said 
component (a) is selected from the group consisting of 

methyl ethyl ketone, ethyl acetate, ethanol, water, 
acetone, propanol, and a combination thereof.  

 
The method according to any of the preceding claims, 
in which said component (b) is selected from the group 

consisting of one or more hygroscopic salts and/or one or 
more low- or very low-volatile or hygroscopic organic or 

hygroscopic inorganic components, for example water, 
polyhydric alcohols, glycol ethers, ethanolamines and 

amides, calcium chloride and magnesium chloride. 
The method according to any of the preceding claims, 
in which said component (c) is selected from the group 

consisting of one or more organic and/or inorganic pigments 
and/or dyes or any other colour-generating component. 
The method according to any of the preceding claims, 
in which the ink composition contains a binder selected 

from the group consisting of one or more polymers and/or 
resins which are soluble and/or dispersible in a mixture of 

the components (a), (b) and (c), for example poly(ethyleneglycol), 
acrylates, poly(vinylacetate), nitrocellulose, 

poly(vinylalcohol), or a combination thereof. 
The method according to any of claims 4 to 6, in 
which the component (b) is selected from the group 

consisting of calcium chloride and water, glycerol and 
water, triethanolamine, mono-ethyleneglycol and water, 

formamide and water, or a combination thereof.
