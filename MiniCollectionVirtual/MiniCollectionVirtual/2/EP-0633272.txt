<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a supported catalyst for the polymerization of olefins, the process for the preparation
thereof and the use of said supported catalyst in processes for the polymerization of olefins.Homogeneous catalytic systems for the polymerization of olefins based on coordination complexes of a transition
metal such as titanium, zirconium or hafnium with ligands of the cyclopentadienyl type are known. Generally, these
catalytic system comprise a soluble cocatalyst, such as the methylalumoxane (MAO).These homogeneous catalytic systems show many advantages in comparison with traditional heterogeneous catalysts
of the Ziegler-Natta type. In particular, they allow a careful control of the stereoregularity degree and type, the
molecular weight distribution and comonomer distribution, besides making easier the use of higher alpha-olefins, diolefins
and dienes as comonomers. Thus, new polymers or polymers endowed with remarkably improved properties
can be obtained.However, being soluble in the reaction system, these catalytic systems can not easily be be utilized in polymerization
processes which are not carried out in solution. Furthermore, the polymers obtained by processes using the
above mentioned catalysts, are generally not endowed with satisfactory morphological characteristics.In order to avoid these drawbacks, systems have been suggested based on supporting at least one component
of the above mentioned catalysts on insoluble solid supports. In most cases these solid supports consist of inorganic
oxides and, in particular, of silica or alumina.In the prior art, cases are found wherein the opportunity of using supports of the polymeric type is foreseen.In European patent applications EP-279 863 and EP-295 312 supported homogeneous catalysts comprising methylalumoxane
and bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride are described. Besides silica inorganic supports, organic
supports consisting of polyethylene or polystyrene have been used. In the preparation of the supported catalysts, use
has been made of n-decane, which has the function of precipitating the methylalumoxane. These supported catalysts,
after a prepolymerization treatment with ethylene in n-decane, have been used in the polymerization reaction of ethylene
in gas-phase. To attain acceptable results, high amounts of methylalumoxane for each gram of solid support
have been used.In European patent application EP-518 092 catalysts of the type metallocene/alumoxane supported on polypropylene
are described. These catalysts have
