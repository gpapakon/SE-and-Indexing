<ABSTRACT>
A massaging apparatus (110) with a massaging mechanism 
(120) comprises at least one pressing member (121) for 

pressing against a specific location of a body portion, and a 
unit (131, 132, 136) for moving the pressing member 

transversely across the specific location while the pressing 
member is pressed against the specific location. 
The massaging apparatus may further include a support 
body (111, 112) for pressing the body portion. At least one 

massaging opening (113a, 113b) is formed in the support body 
for alignment with the specific location of a body portion 

placed on the support body. The massaging mechanism is 
provided inside the support body so that an upper end of the 

pressing member is projecting outward through the massaging 
opening. When the body portion is placed on the support 

body, the specific location of the body portion is pressed 
and massaged by the pressing member while the pressing member 

is transversely moved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for massaging a specific 
portion of a human body to relieve fatigue or stiffness of 
the body portion. Massaging apparatuses or machines to relieve a stiffness in 
a specific portion of a body (such as in the shoulder, the neck 
etc.) are well known and in widespread practical use. The 
massaging apparatus typically give a massage by tapping or 
vibrating the specific body portion. For example, an apparatus for tapping on the shoulder, an 
apparatus with a vibrator to vibrate on the body portion, an 
apparatus with a pair of arms to grasp and massage a body 
portion, and an apparatus with rollers which are pushed on a body 
portion and moved along the body are all known. The applicant of the present invention has a long experience 
in massaging the human body and found that the most effective way 
for massaging human body is to press a fingertip against a 
specific body portion and to move transversely the pressed 
fingertip on the body portion. Typically, the fingertip can be 
transversely moved so as to describe a circle locus, an ellipse  
 
locus or a locus of a figure "8". The movement of the fingertip so as to describe an ellipse 
locus is experientially found to be particularly effective for 
relieving stiffness and fatigue of the human body. It is an object of the invention to provide a massaging 
apparatus which enables a massage very similar to a massage by 
pressing a fingertip against a specific body portion and moving 
the pressed fingertip transversely on the specific body portion. It is an another object of the invention to provide a 
massaging apparatus which enables a massage very similar to a 
massage by pressing a fingertip against a specific body portion 
and moving the pressed fingertip transversely so as to describe 
an ellipse locus on the specific body portion. It is a still another object of the invention to provide a 
massaging apparatus which enables a massage very similar to a 
massage by pressing a fingertip against a specific body portion 
and moving the pressed fingertip transversely so as to describe a 
circle locus on the specific body portion. It is a further object of the invention to provide a massaging 
apparatus which enables a massage very similar to a massage 
by pressing a fingertip against a specific body portion and 
moving the pressed fingertip transversely so as to describe a 
locus of a figure "8". It is a still further object of the invention to provide a
