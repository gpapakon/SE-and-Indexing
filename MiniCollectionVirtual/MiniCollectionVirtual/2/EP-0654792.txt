<ABSTRACT>
So as to be able to check the correct running of the programming cycles in an EEPROM-type memory, additional pilot cells (9) are provided. A data write operation is performed in three successive cycles:     - programming of a pilot cell (9) to a first logic value,   - programming of the data and - programming of the pilot cell (9) to a logic value complementary to the first value.   The state of the pilot cell makes it possible to detect interruptions to the supply during programming.

Electrically modifiable non-volatile memory 
including a set of memory cells (1), means of 

addressing (3, 4) and programming (7) the said cells 
(1), an interface circuit (6) and at least one 

additional memory cell (9), hereinafter referred to 
as a reference cell, the whole being controlled by a 

control circuit (2) comprising means (10, 11) of 
selectively controlling the programming of the said 

reference cell (9), characterised in that, in 
response to any write command received by the said 

interface circuit (6), the control circuit activates 
three successive programming cycles (CY1, CY2, CY3): 


a first programming cycle (CY1) for the said 
reference cell (9), to write a first predetermined 

binary logic value, 
a second programming cycle (CY2) writing data to 
be written in the said set of memory cells (1), and 
a third programming cycle (CY3) for the said 
reference cell, to write a second logic value 

complementary to the first. 
Memory according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that it includes a single reference cell (9). 
Memory according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the said interface circuit (6) communicates 

with the said reference cell (9) to supply a first 
test signal (RT0) representing the state of the said 

reference cell (9).  
 
Memory according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that it includes a test flip-flop (BT), initially 

set at zero, in that, following the said third 
programming cycle (CY3), the control circuit (2) 

reads the said reference cell and applies the result 
of the said reading to the positioning input (S) of 

the said test flip-flop (BT) and in that the said 
interface circuit (6) communicates with the said 

test flip-flop (BT) to supply a second test signal 
(RT) representing the state of the said test flip-flop 

(BT). 
Memory according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that it is organised into words of fixed size, 

associated with corresponding addresses, and 
includes one reference cell (9) per block of words, 

a block of words having a predetermined number of 
common address bits, and in that, in response to a 

command to write a word from one of the said blocks 
to the memory, the control circuit selects one of 

the said reference cells according to the said 
common address bits and applies the said first and 

third programming cycles (CY1, CY3) to the said 
reference cell selected. 
Memory according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that the said interface circuit (6) is designed to 

receive an external test control signal (CT) and in 
that, in response to a read command and to the said 

test control signal (CT), the control circuit (2) 
reads the reference cell (9) addressed by the most 

significant elements of the address associated with 
the said read command in order to supply a first 

test signal (RT0) representing the state of the said 
reference cell (9). 
Memory according to Claim 1, characterised in  
 

that it is organised into words of fixed size 
associated with corresponding addresses, and 

includes one reference cell (9) per word, and in 
that, in response to a command to write a word, the 

control circuit selects one of the said reference 
cells according to the address of the said word and 

applies the said first and third programming cycles 
(CY1, CY3) to the said reference cell selected.
 
Memory according to Claim 7, characterised in 
that the said interface circuit (6) is designed to 

receive an external test control signal (CT) and in 
that, in response to a read command and to the said 

test control signal (CT), the control circuit (2) 
reads the reference cell (9) selected by the address 

associated with the said read command to supply a 
first test signal (RT0) representing the state of 

the said reference cell (9). 
Memory according to one of Claims 5 to 8, 
characterised in that it includes a test flip-flop 

(BT), initially set at zero, in that, following the 
said third programming cycle (CY3), the control 

circuit (2) reads the said selected reference cell 
and applies the result of the said reading to the 

positioning input (S) of the said test flip-flop 
(BT) and in that the said interface circuit (6) 

communicates with the said test flip-flop (BT) to 
supply a second test signal (RT) representing the 

state of the said test flip-flop (BT).
