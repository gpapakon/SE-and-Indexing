<ABSTRACT>
The whole recognition process in the recognition of a speech signal as far as the output of the recognised sequence of words or of the recognised sentence is subdivided, according to the invention, in such a way that firstly, for various starting instants, only word hypotheses are generated separately, and temporary word chains corresponding to a word graph are constructed from these word hypotheses, the word graph produced in so doing being continuously optimised by clearing parts of the word chains. For this purpose, parts of word chains having the same beginning and end point are compared with each other and the evaluation values from words having end points equal in time are compared with a threshold value. Further measures are specified for optimising the word graph. For the output, a particularly effective subsequent treatment is specified, in that for each false word, all further words with the same starting point are output, from which the operator can rapidly choose the correct word.

<CLAIMS>
A method of determining a sequence of words of a predetermined
vocabulary in a speech signal, comprising the steps of:


sampling the speech signal at recurrent instants so as to produce a sequence of test
signals;
signal-wise comparing the test signals with different sequences of reference signals
while generating scores, each sequence of reference signals representing a word of the

vocabulary, the comparison always commencing anew with subsequent test signals,
starting from the beginning of sequences of reference signals;
deriving, for each word end reached, a word result which comprises at least a reference
to the beginning of the ended word, a word score, and a reference to the ended word;
deriving at least one sequence of words from the word results, and outputting the words
successively from the beginning,
characterized in that
 each comparison commencing anew with the beginning of
sequences of reference signals is separately carried out as far as the word end,

independently of any other comparison,

that preliminary word strings are formed, so as to be stored, by means of the word
results of the word ends by joining each word which ends at an instantaneous test signal

to each preliminary word string which ends directly preceding the beginning of the
relevant word ending at said instantaneous test signal in order to form a new

preliminary word string, the word score of each word being combined with the score
reached at the end of the preliminary word string so as to form a new score, the most

favorable new score being used as the initial score for a comparison newly started
immediately thereafter, beginning with the different sequences of reference signals.
A method as claimed in Claim 1,
characterized in that
 for each new preliminary word string it is checked whether at least
a part of this word string is identical, in respect of word order, to a part of another

preliminary word string, the parts having started and ended at the same test signal, all
words ended last of identical parts being erased with the exception of the last word 

ended of the preliminary word string with the most favorable score.
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that
 the joined word of all new preliminary word strings whose score is
less favorable than the best score of all preliminary word strings preliminarily ending at

the instantaneous test signal by more than a predetermined threshold value is erased.
A method as claimed in Claim 3,
characterized in that
 for the comparison with the threshold value use is made of a
further score which is formed by a combination of the new score and a language model

score which is selected, in conformity with the combination of the relevant ended word
and at least the last word of the preliminary word string whereto the relevant ended

word is added, from a first set of predetermined language model scores.
A method as claimed in one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that
 for each newly started comparison the most favorable score at the
end of the preceding word string is combined with a correction value.
A method as claimed in one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that
 words ending at the same test signal form a common end of
preliminary word strings, and that the ending words arising from the comparison newly

started immediately after said end are joined to said common end, and that for word
strings in which several intermediate words or intermediate word sequences have started

at the same test signal and have ended at the same other test signal, and where the
comparison newly started after said other test signal is not continued further with at

least one sequence of reference signals, for each of these intermediate words or
intermediate word sequences at least the word scores up to the word ended last are

combined to form an intermediate score, the intermediate word or the intermediate word
sequence being erased when the intermediate score exceeds the threshold value.
A method as claimed in one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that
 each part of a word string with an end whereto not at least one
word has been added and at which the comparison, newly started after this end, is not

continued with at least one sequence of reference signals is erased.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that
, at least at the end of the speech signal, end scores are determined,
for all non-erased word strings, from the word scores of the words in each string and

from language model scores derived, for coherent parts of the word strings, from a 
second set of predetermined language model values, the words of at least the w
ord
string having the most favorable end score being successively output as from the

beginning of this string.
A method as claimed in one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that
, during output of the words of a word string as from the
beginning, for different words within this word string, one of a plurality of words

which succeed the relevant word, have been joined during formation of the preliminary
word strings, and have not been erased, can be selected, the word string output in all

such cases being continued with the selected word in such a case, the selectable words
in the sequence of the scores producing the word string output thus far, including the

selectable words, then, being output.
A method as claimed in Claim 9,
characterized in that
 new end scores are determined after selection of another word,
which new end scores emanate at least from the selected word, after which the words of

the word string emanating from this selected word and offering the most favorable end
score are successively output.
A device for carrying out the method claimed in one of the preceding
Claims, comprising


means for picking up an acoustic signal and for generating a sequence of test signals,
means for storing sequences of reference signals corresponding to words,
means for comparing the sequences of test signals with the sequences of reference
signals,
means for generating word results which comprise scores and reference data, and
means for outputting at least one sequence of words,
characterized in that
 there are provided

means for generating preliminary word strings from the word results,
means for storing the preliminary word strings,
means for comparing the stored preliminary word strings with one another and for
comparing the scores of the stored preliminary word strings with a threshold value and

for erasing at least the last words of stored preliminary word strings in dependence on
the result of the comparison.
A device as claimed in Claim 11,
characterized in that
 it comprises 

means for receiving a first control signal and for outputting a plurality of words from
word strings in response to the first control signal, and
means for receiving a second control signal and for selecting one of the plurality of
words output.
