<ABSTRACT>
The bearing (3) for the ball joint head is formed as a cage and comprises three ring elements (4,5,6) of which the first has an arc length which is greater than half the periphery of the circular ring of which it is a part. The other two ring segments (5,6) are fitted at the ends of the first segment (4) so that they at least partly engage over the equator line (7) of the ball joint head (2) held in the ball cage. The radii of the ring segments and the head are the same. The surfaces of the bearing cage facing the ball joint head are coated with an inlay of low friction material, which is so elastic that the ball joint head under elastic deformation of the inlay can be pressed into the ball cage.

<CLAIMS>
Shoulder joint endoprosthesis consisting of a stem part (1) to be anchored in the 
humerus (20), a ball joint head (2) which can be connected to the proximal end of the 

stem part (1) and having a bearing (3) for the ball joint head (2) designed as a 
bearing cage and which can be fixed to the shoulder blade (21) in the prepared 

natural joint socket (22), characterised in that the bearing (3) consists of essentially 
three annular segments (4, 5, 6), of which the first annular segment (4) has an arc 

length which is greater than half the periphery of the circular ring, of which it is 
part, and of which the two other annular segments (5, 6) are attached to the ends (4', 

4'') of the first annular segment (4) such that they at least partly engage over the 
equatorial line (7) of the ball joint head (2) retained in the ball cage, wherein the 

radii of the annular segments (4, 5, 6) and of the ball joint head (2) are essentially 
the same. 
Shoulder joint endoprosthesis according to claim 1, in which the surfaces of the 
bearing cage (3) facing the ball joint head (2) are lined in each case with an inlay 

(10) of low-friction material which is so resilient that the ball joint head (2) may be 
pressed into the ball cage (3) with resilient deformation of the inlay. 
Shoulder joint endoprosthesis according to claim 2, in which the inlays of the two 
other annular segments (5, 6) have on their outer surface a groove into which an 

open spring ring is inserted. 
Shoulder joint endoprosthesis according to claim 3, in which the two other annular 
segments (5, 6) have on their inner side a groove into which the spring ring comes to 

rest. 
Shoulder joint endoprosthesis according to one of claims 1 to 4, in which a flange 
(8) placed approximately tangentially on the first annular segment (4) is moulded-on 

externally in the region of the other annular segment (6) as a locking means for the 
bearing cage (3) on the shoulder blade.  

 
Shoulder joint endoprosthesis according to one of claims 1 to 5, in which an 
anchoring pin (9) pointing radially outwards from the first annular segment (4) and 

for fixing the bearing cage (3) is provided on the shoulder blade.
