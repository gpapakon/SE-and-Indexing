<ABSTRACT>
A double glazed window has an outer glass panel (2) separated by an inner glass panel (7) with an evacuated or glass fitted separating space (5). The outer surface of the outer glass panel is covered with a coating of toning material (1). The inner surface has a pattern of first and second part surfaces (3,4) that run vertically to the polarising direction of the incident emission (R). The first surface is formed by a metal, e.g. gold or silver, and the second by a free surface. The inner surface of the inner plate has a radar reflecting layer.

Window glazing, comprising double-glazing with sealed 
intermediate space, having in the area of the outer pane a light-permeable 

layer with defined surface resistance, and in which the 
inner pane is provided with a radar-reflecting layer, 
characterised 
in that
 the layer in the area of the outer pane (2) is composed of 
alternately arranged striplike first radar-reflecting surface portions 

(3) which extend parallel to each other and second non-radar-reflecting 
surface portions (4) the longitudinal axes of which are 

aligned virtually vertically to incurring electro-magnetic radiation, 
and the proportion of electro-magnetic radiation reflected by the 

radar-reflecting layer and again passed through the light-permeable 
coating equals virtually the proportion of radiation 

reflected by the light-permeable layer. 
Window glazing according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
first surface portions (3) are composed of a coated metal layer 

having a mean surface resistance in the region of between 5 and 
400 Ω/
□
. 
Window glazing according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the 
surface resistance of the first surface portion (3) lies in the region 

between 10 and 30 Ω/
□
. 
Window glazing according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised 
in that
 the width (d1) of the first surface portions (3) and the width 
(d2) of the second surface portions (4) are related to each other in 

such a manner that 2
<
 d1/d2 
<
 10. 
Window glazing according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised 
in that
 the sum of the widths (d1, d2) of a respective first and a 

second surface portion (3, 4) is always less than the wavelength 
of the operating frequency: d1 + d2 
<
 λ
o
. 
Window glazing according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised 
in that
 a further pane is arranged in the space (5) between the 
outer pane (2) and the inner pane (7).
