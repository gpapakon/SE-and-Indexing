<ABSTRACT>
A system is provided for depositing an extremely small amount of 
solder on a printed circuit board by varying the direction of an electric 

current applied to a solder stream. The force exerted on the solder can 
be substantially instantaneously reversed without the necessity of 

changing the form of the energy applied to the solder from electrical to 
vibratory, ultrasonic, magnetic, or the like. The direction and 

magnitude of the force is related to the cross product of an electric 
current vector and a magnetic field vector (F=IxB). A programmable 

current source is used to place an electric current through the liquid 
solder as it is flowing through a conduit. A magnetic coil is disposed 

adjacent the conduit in order to provide a magnetic field in the same 
plane as the electric current. The conduit supplies liquid solder to a 

nozzle which then deposits a droplet of solder onto a printed circuit 
board. Therefore, as the current is applied, in a first direction 

through the solder, an outward force is exerted on the solder. When the 
direction of the current is reversed, then the direction of the force 

exerted on the solder is also reversed, and an extremely small droplet of 
solder is "snapped off" of the solder stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a dispensing system for 
depositing electrically conductive liquid (eg molten solder) onto a 
printed circuit board (PCB) or other electronic device. With advances in chip fabrication technology, an ever increasing 
number of integrated circuits are being built into the chips. This 
growing number of devices, requires a correspondingly greater number of 
input/output (I/O) connection points to be provided to the chips. The 
effect, to the computer fabrication industry, of closely spacing these 
I/Os is to require a system that can mechanically dispose and 
electrically connect the chips to a printed circuit board, for use in a 
computer system. Of course, it is well known to use solder as a means of 
providing both of these functions and there are many conventional systems 
for dispensing solder onto a printed circuit board. For example, US patent 4,828,886 uses a piezoelectric transducer to 
propel solder droplets onto a work piece. Other conventional systems (US 
patents 3,222,776 and US 4,754,900) utilize ultrasonic generators to 
create ultrasonic vibrations near a nozzle, or the like to urge solder 
onto a wettable surface. Additionally, electromagnetic devices are known in the art which 
control the flow of metal through a conduit, or the like. For example, 
US 4,842,170, describes an electromagnetic pump, which includes an 
alternating current coil adjacent a nozzle. The coil produces a magnetic 
field which induces a current in the liquid metal and urges the metal 
through the nozzle. The nozzle includes a nonconductive insert which 
redirects the induced eddy currents in the axial direction to enhance the 
metal flow. The insert may be positioned so as to impede the flow of the 
liquid metal such that the electromagnetic pump acts as a valve. US 
3,807,903 is another example of a conventional system wherein the 
magnetic field is varied to induce electrical current in the conductive 
metal flowing through a pipe. Additionally, varying the induced current 
changes the value of heat dissipation energy taken from the flow of the 
conductive liquid to hydrodynamically control the flow rate of the 
liquid.  US patents 4,398,589; 4,566,859; and 3,515,898 all describe various 
electromagnetic pumps for conveying conductive material through a 
conduit. An "electromagnetic conduit" is described by US 4,216,800 
wherein electrical conductors are disposed along an axis which coincides 
with the axis to be imposed on a stream of conductive liquid. High
