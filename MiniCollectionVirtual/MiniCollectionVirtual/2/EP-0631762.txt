<ABSTRACT>
- The present invention relates to a prosthesis intended to be introduced into a body duct, comprising a flexible tube (2) intended to retain the normal passage cross-section of the body duct and a holding device (5) intended to immobilise the said tube (2) in position in the said duct (U), the said device (5) being connected to the distal end of the said tube (2) by connection means (4), while being arranged at a distance from the said end. - According to the invention, the holding device consists of a radially deformable structure (5) capable of passing from a first state in which its cross-section is at most equal to that of the body duct (U) into which it is to be introduced, to a second state in which its cross-section is such that the said structure (5) can bear on the inner wall of the said body duct, especially in the vicinity of the edge of an orifice in the body duct (U) emerging in a natural cavity.

Removable urethral prosthesis for treating a
stenosis of the bulbo-membranous urethra (U),

comprising:

a flexible tube (2) intended to preserve the
normal cross-sectional passage of the bulbo-membranous

urethra (U) and constituting the
prosthesis proper;
a holding device (5) intended to immobilize said
flexible tube (2) in position in the bulbo-membranous

urethra (U), said holding device (5)
being radially deformable and capable of changing

from a first state, in which its cross section is
at most equal to that of the urethra (U), to a

second state, in which its cross section is such
that said device (5) can bear on the inner wall of

the urethra near to where the latter opens into a
cavity (L), and, conversely, of changing from said

second state to said first state; and
filamentary connection means (4) connecting said
holding device (5) to the distal end of said

flexible tube (2), maintaining said holding device
(5) at a distance from said end, said filamentary

connection means (4) being intended to pass
through the sphincter,
characterized in that
 said holding device is a tubular
structure (5) formed by a helical spring (5) having

along at least most of its length a cross section of
oblong shape, of which the small dimension (A) is equal 

to the diameter of the flexible tube (2) and at most
equal to the internal diameter of the bulbo-membranous

urethra (U).
Prosthesis according to Claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the windings (3) of said helical spring (5) are
at least substantially contiguous.
Prosthesis according to one of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that
 the oblong cross section of said
spring (5) is constant along the entire length of the

latter.
Prosthesis according to one of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that
 the large dimension (B) of the
oblong cross section of said helical spring (5)

increases progressively from the proximal end (5a) to
the distal end (5b) of the latter.
Prosthesis according to any one of Claims 1 to
4, 
characterized in that
 said spring (5) is made of
metal wire of medical quality.
Prosthesis according to any one of Claims 1 to
5, 
characterized in that
 said flexible tube is a
helical spring (2), with at least substantially

contiguous windings (3), and with a circular cross
section.
Prosthesis according to any one of Claims 1 to
6, 
characterized in that
 said filamentary connection
means are formed by a metal wire (4).
