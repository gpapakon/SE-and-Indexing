<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic head having its
magnetic path constituted by a magnetic metal film, and a method
for manufacture thereof. More particularly, it relates to a
magnetic head having its coil formed by a thin film process, and
a method for manufacture thereof.As magnetic heads for VTRs, a so-called metal-in-gap type
magnetic head, in which a magnetic metal film is formed on the
magnetic gap forming surface of the ferrite magnetic core, or a
laminated magnetic head having a magnetic metal film sandwiched
between non-magnetic ceramic layers, is currently employed. For
coping with the future tendency towards higher picture quality
and digitalization, higher electro-magnetic conversion
characteristics need to be achieved for higher frequencies.
Besides, plural magnetic heads need to be loaded on a small-sized
drum.However, the above-mentioned metal-in-gap magnetic head has
a larger impedance and is not suited to application in a higher
frequency range. On the other hand, it is necessary with the
laminated magnetic head to decrease the thickness of the magnetic
metal film of the magnetic path in conjunction with decrease in
the track width brought about by the recording with an
increasingly high recording density. The result is the lowering 
of the playback efficiency and certain limitations placed on the
increase in the number of magnetic heads.There has hitherto been proposed a magnetic head in which,
for successfully coping with signals in the high frequency range,
the magnetic path constituted by the magnetic metal film is
reduced in area as compared to that with the conventional VTR
head, and in which a thin film coil is formed on the magnetic gap
forming surface using the thin film forming technique, as
disclosed for example in JP Patent Kokai Publication No.63-231713
(1988).However, it becomes necessary with such construction of the
magnetic head to provide a space for accommodating the thin film
coil in the counterpart magnetic core provided facing the
magnetic core having the thin film coil formed thereon.If the space is formed by a machining operation, an opening
which needs to be plugged with glass or the like is necessarily
formed on the surface of the magnetic head on which the magnetic
recording medium is slid.During the glass plugging process, which is an indispensable
process, molten glass flows on the thin film coil portion, thus
raising the problems such as line breakage or shorting.Besides, since there is a risk of damages done or the stress
applied to the magnetic gap
