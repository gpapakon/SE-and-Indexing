<ABSTRACT>
A safety helmet for e.g. motorcycles has its outer shell formed as a sandwich, comprising outer (33) and inner (30-32) composite layers each of resin and impact-resistant material separated by an intermediate layer (34) of resilient material. The impact-resistant material is preferably a cloth of high tensile strength fibre such as KevlarTM, DynemaTM, glass fibre, or carbon fibre. The resilient material may be cork or foamed or other resilient plastics material, but is preferably honeycomb material of paper or aluminium. The helmet is made by sequentially laying up, in or over a former, a first composite layer of resin and sheets of impact-resistant material, an intermediate layer of honeycomb material, and a second composite layer of resin and sheets of impact-resistant material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to safety helmets, and particularly but not
exclusively crash helmets for motorcyclists.The general requirements for a safety helmet are that it should have a
strong and shatterproof outer shell and an inner support or lining which
spreads and cushions any sharp blow to the shell. A motorcycle crash helmet
also has various special requirements, such as that it should protect the face and
the back and sides of the user's head as well as the top of the skull, that it
should not come off in an accident, that it should resist penetration by sharp
objects, and that it should have a transparent visor.The standard construction of crash helmet consists of a substantially
spheroidal outer shell of tough plastics material, which may be made by injection
moulding, wet laying up, or a similar process, and an inner lining of resilient
material. The outer shell may be a glass fibre or Kevlar™ laminate, and the
inner lining may be a foam material. When such a helmet is struck, the energy
is dissipated and absorbed primarily by the inner lining; the outer shell is
essentially rigid, and serves primarily to transmit and spread the load to the
inner lining.As shown in FR 2 336 169 (Gallet), the outer shell may be formed as a
sandwich, comprising outer and inner composite layers each of high tensile
strength material impregnated with resin, separated by an intermediate layer of
honeycomb material. GB 717 121 (George) and FR 2 346 992 (Morin & Coignac)
show similar constructions.The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved crash
helmet, though the invention extends to safety helmets generally.Accordingly the invention provides a safety helmet comprising an outer
shell formed as a sandwich, comprising outer and inner composite layers each of
resin and impact-resistant material separated by an intermediate layer of resilient
material, characterized in that the outer shell is of generally polyhedral form comprising a
plurality of polygonal faces, preferably approximately in the form of part of a
truncated icosahedron.The impact-resistant material may be a cloth of Kevlar™, Dynema™, glass
fibre, or carbon fibre. The resilient material may be cork or foamed or other 
resilient plastics material, but is preferably honeycomb material of paper or
aluminium.The invention also provides a manner of constructing such a safety helmet,
comprising sequentially laying up, in or over a former, a first composite layer
of resin and sheets of impact-resistant material, an intermediate layer
