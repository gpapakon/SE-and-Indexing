engagement with the filter material (138), a filter feed 

mechanism, a tube for supplying liquid (154) and a chute 
(62) for supplying beverage product to an upper portion of 

the brewing cylinder (80), and a conical dispersing surface 
(150) disposed at the upper portion of the brewing cylinder 

(80) upon which the liquid and beverage product impinge from 
their supply means and which disperses the liquid and 

beverage product as they fall to a bottom portion of the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an hot beverage 
brewing apparatus and, more particularly, to the type 
used by merchandisers for brewing and selling 
predetermined amounts of hot beverages of various types. There are many types of hot beverage brewing 
apparatus that use a variety of constructions and 
techniques for brewing and dispensing. Some, for 
example, utilize pressurized brewing chambers to shorten 
the brewing time. Others utilize brewing chambers that 
are open to atmosphere, but which are designed to agitate 
and mix the brewing liquid and product in some manner to 
shorten the brewing time. In either form of device the 
object is to use the least amount of beverage product, 
such as tea or coffee grounds, and to obtain the maximum 
flavor for the volume of water used, in the shortest 
possible time. Although the pressurized brewer is 
effective in shortening the brewing time, prior art 
constructions are fairly complex in construction and thus 
are difficult to disassemble and clean. Likewise, prior 
art constructions of open brewing chambers generally 
utilize pistons to form the bottom of the brewing chamber 
which is difficult to maintain without leakage and is 
difficult to clean. Since almost all such hot drink 
merchandisers are intended to be left at an unattended 
location for substantial periods of time, such as several 
days, it is essential that they can be easily and quickly 
cleaned. The prior art constructions of piston-type 
brewing chambers referred to above are particularly prone 
to wear because of the sliding contact between the piston 
and sealing rings and the brewing cylinder wall. This 
wear results in a frequent need of disassembly and 
replacement of the worn parts which is time consuming,  
 
relatively complex and expensive. One of form of piston type brewing chamber, 
beverage making apparatus is disclosed in US-A-4,967,647 and 
this comprises:- 
a brewing cylinder providing a brewing chamber 
therein for receiving a hot liquid and a beverage product 
for brewing; a base member disposed beneath the brewing 
cylinder and having a brewed liquid outlet therein through 
with beverage brewed in the brewing chamber can flow; means for sealing between the base member and a 
bottom end of the brewing cylinder with a filter material 
therebetween for sealing the cylinder during brewing when 
the brewing cylinder is brought into engagement with the 
filter material; means for feeding filter material between the 
bottom edge of the brewing cylinder and the base member
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A beverage brewing and dispensing machine, 
comprising: 


a brewing cylinder (80) providing a brewing 
chamber therein for receiving a hot liquid and a beverage 

product for brewing; 
a base member (120) disposed beneath the brewing 
cylinder and having a brewed liquid outlet (142) therein 

through which beverage brewed in the brewing chamber can 
flow; 
means for sealing (132) between the base member 
(120) and a bottom end of the brewing cylinder with a filter 

material (138) therebetween for sealing the cylinder (80) 
during brewing when the brewing cylinder (80) is brought 

into engagement with the filter material (138); 
means for feeding filter material between the
