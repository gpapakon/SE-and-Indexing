 1 DIFFERENTIAL DRIVER/RECEIVER CIRCUIT2 FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates generally to the field of digital circuitry, and more generally t differential driver and receiver circuits. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Digital electronic systems are generally fabricated from a number of integrated circuit chip that mount on printed circuit boards. The printed circuit boards carry traces that facilitate the transfe of signals representing digital information among the chips and other components on the boards. digital system may comprise a number of boards mounted in one or more cabinets, and it is generall necessary to interconnect the boards to facilitate transfer of signals among the boards. Within a singl cabinet, the wires in the form of backplanes or cables may be used to transfer signals among th broads, and between cabinets cables are typically used as transmission lines to transfer the signals. In particular between cabinets, but also between boards and in some cases between chips on the same board, "differential" signaling is typically used. In differential signaling, two physical signal are transmitted together as a "differential pair" to facilitate the transfer of a single bit of information, with the logical state of the information bit being represented by the difference in voltage levels between the signals. If, for example, one signal of the differential pair is at a high voltage level and the other is at a low voltage level, the logical state of the information bit may be taken as asserted, or a "one." On the other hand, if the states of the signals are reversed, the logical state of the information bit may be taken as negated, or a "zero." Differential signaling may be used for a number of reasons. Differential signaling may be used to reduce the likelihood that information transferred can be corrupted due to some types of noise, or undesirable voltage changes, which may be induced in the lines carrying the signals between the signal driver and the receiver. The lines which carry differential signal pairs are typically routed adjacent each other, and if noise is induced in one line it will likely also contemporaneously be induced in the other and with the same amplitude, resulting in what is generally known as "common-mode noise." Since the state of the information bit is represented by the difference between the voltage levels in the two lines, the noise voltage in the two lines will cancel. In addition, differential signaling may be used when routing lines between components of a
