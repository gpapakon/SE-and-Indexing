<ABSTRACT>
When a radio clock is used in a clock radio, considerable problems occur due to interference radiation from the power supply and clock display into the ferrite antenna used for receiving the time information. Interference radiation is avoided with the circuit arrangement according to the invention due to a clever combination of the radio clock reception with the FM antenna.

Radio receiver with built-in radio clock for
controlling various wake-up, alarm or switching functions,

the receiving unit (3) of the radio clock being spatially
separated from the other modules, characterized in that the

receiving unit (3) which is used to receive the items of
time information broadcast in the long wave range is

disposed at the appliance-remote end of a throw-out aerial
(4) provided for the VHF reception of the radio receiver

(6), in that the throw-out aerial (4) is made up of at
least one line (al, a2) and an associated screen (a3) and

in that the screen (a3) is used at the same time as the
aerial for the VHF reception of the radio receiver.
Radio receiver according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the receiving unit (3) comprises a receiving section

(2) and a ferrite aerial (1) and these form a compact unit,
in that the receiving section (2) contains a receiver tuned

to the transmission frequency of the standard time
transmitter, a demodulator and a pulse shaper, and in that

the ferrite aerial is disposed at an angle of 90 degrees to
the throw-out aerial (4).
Radio receiver according to Claims 1 to 2,
characterized in that the throw-out aerial (4) comprising

at least one line (al, a2) is a two-core screened line
whose length is equal to one quarter of the wavelength used

for the VHF radio broadcasting, and in that one (al) of the
internal cores of said screened line is used to supply

power to the receiving section (2) and the other (a2)
internal core is used to transmit the time information.
Radio receiver according to Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that a parallel circuit of choke coils

(L
1
-L
3
) is provided at the receiving end for high-frequency
decoupling and in that the reactance of said parallel 

circuit is of high impedance compared with the bottom-end
impedance (Re) of the VHF aerial input.
