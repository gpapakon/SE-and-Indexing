<ABSTRACT>
This visual display device comprises a light source (S) simultaneously emitting several ranges of chromatic components (R, V, B) and a spatial light modulator (LCD) comprising several dots each including at least one sub-pixel per range of chromatic component to be displayed. Between the light source (S) and the spatial light modulator (LCD) there are provided:   - at least one chromatic separator (RC) separating the light of the various chromatic ranges (R, V, B) in angle along different directions; - a lens focusing the light of the various chromatic ranges at separate points or along separate lines contained in a defined plane;   - at least one spatial filter (FI) situated in this defined plane and selectively filtering the light of the various chromatic ranges; - an array of lenses (MLC) each making it possible to focus the light of each chromatic range substantially onto one sub-pixel.   Applications: colour visual display projector.

Colour display device comprising:

a light source (S) which simultaneously emits
several ranges of chromatic components (R, G, B);
a spatial light modulator (LCD) comprising
several dots, each having at least one subpixel per

range of chromatic component to be displayed;
at least one colour splitter (RC) which splits
the light of the various chromatic ranges (R, G, B)

angularly along different directions;
an array of lenses (MLC), each lens allowing
the light of each chromatic range to be focused

substantially on one subpixel;

characterized in that the colour splitter comprises a
single component having phase microstructures with

index variations obtained by optical recording in a
photosensitive material.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the splitter has three layers of separately

recorded superimposed materials.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the splitter comprises a single layer of material

in which several arrays are recorded by multiplexing.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that it comprises:


a lens which focuses the light of various
chromatic ranges onto separate points or along separate

lines contained in a defined plane; 
at least one spatial filter (FI) lying in this
defined plane and selectively filtering the light of

the various chromatic ranges.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the array of lenses (MLC) is

bonded to the spatial light modulator (LCD) and
comprises an array of cylindrical lenses, each

cylindrical lens being arranged parallel to a line of
dots.
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the array of lenses has dimensions approximately

equal to those of the spatial light modulator.
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the width of each lens is approximately equal to

that of a band of dots.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the spatial light modulator is a

liquid-crystal screen.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that it comprises a prism, the

splitter (RC) being bonded to one of the faces of the
prism and receiving the light from the source at an

angle of incidence appropriate to the periodicity of
the phase microstructures.
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the splitter (RC) operates in reflection mode and

transmits the light to an exit face of the prism to
which the array of lenses (MLC)/spatial light modulator

(LCD) assembly is bonded.
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the splitter (RC) operates in transmission mode

and is bonded to the lens array (MLC)/spatial light
modulator (LCD) assembly.
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in
that it comprises a second lens (L2) which receives the

light from the spatial filter (FI) and transmits beams
of rays parallel to the array of microlenses (MLC).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that one chromatic component (G) of 

the light is not deflected by the splitter and retains
its direction of propagation after passing through the

splitter, while two other chromatic components are
deflected symmetrically with respect to this direction

of propagation.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that it comprises two juxtaposed similar display

devices and a polarization splitter lying between the
source (S) and these display devices, this splitter

sending the light polarized in a first direction to one
of the display devices and the light polarized in a

second direction, perpendicular to the first direction,
to the other display device.
