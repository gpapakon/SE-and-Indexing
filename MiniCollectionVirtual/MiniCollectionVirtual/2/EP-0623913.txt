<ABSTRACT>
In an electroacoustic transducer, the opening portion (5) of a 
casing body (2A) which contains therein a magnetic driving portion (4) 

for converting an electric signal into a sound is closed by a casing cap 
(2B) to form a resonance space (resonance chamber (18)) which 

resonates in response to acoustic vibration generated by the magnetic 
driving portion (4), wherein a plurality of slender projections (48) to be 

entered into said casing body (2A) are projected from the casing cap (2B) 
to position said casing cap (2B) relative to said casing body (2A). As a 

result, it is possible to enlarge the capacity of the resonance chamber (18) 
and improve the assembling accuracy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electroacoustic transducer e.g.
used in a buzzer etc. for converting an electric signal supplied thereto
into a sound, such as e.g. the buzzer known from EP-A-0 289 264.A conventional electroacoustic transducer is provided with a
housing 102 formed of synthetic resin as illustrated in Fig. 5. The
housing 102 is dividedly composed of a casing body 102A and a casing
cap 102B. The casing body 102A is a cylindrical body having openings at
both ends thereof while the casing cap 102B is a short cylindrical body
which is closed at the ceiling surface thereof. Such a construction is
required by the inner structure of the electroacoustic transducer and the
facility of assembly thereof.The casing body 102A accommodates a magnetic driving portion
104 as a means for converting an electric signal into an oscillating
magnetic field. The magnetic driving portion 104 comprises a magnetic
core 106 having a pillar shape at the central portion thereof and a coil
108 wound around the magnetic core 106. The coil 108 is energized by an
alternating current supplied through an input terminal by an external
device. The magnetic core 106 is surrounded by an annular magnet 110
which generates a bias magnetic field.A stepped supporting portion 112 is formed on the inner side of the
upper opening portion of the casing body 102A to support a diaphragm
114. Since the diaphragm 114 is composed of a thin elastic magnetic
member which is attracted and magnetized by the annular magnet 110,
the circumferential edge of the diaphragm 114 is held by the stepped 
supporting portion 112 and a closed magnetic path is formed between the
magnetic core 106 and the annular magnet 110. A magnetic piece 116 is
attached to the central portion of the diaphragm 114 to add mass thereto
and increase magnetic flux density.The casing body 102A is closed by the casing cap 102B at the side of
the upper opening portion thereof to form a resonance chamber 118
serving as a resonance space and a sound emitting cylinder 120 is
formed in the ceiling portion of the casing cap 102B to allow the
resonance chamber 118 to be open to the atmosphere. A sound emitting
hole 122 in the sound emitting cylinder 120 is a means for emitting the
resonant vibration of the resonance chamber 118 to the atmosphere.As to assembling the housing 102 of such an electroacoustic
transducer, a stepped portion 124 is provided at the lower portion of the
casing cap 102B to form a small diameter portion 126 which is smaller
in outer diameter than that of the
