<ABSTRACT>
A circuit for generating a voltage reference comprises a diodes array 
(D1) working in conjunction with a switched capacitor amplifier (99) 

having auto-zero and measure phases so as to create a voltage 
independent of temperature, a sample and hold circuit (85) which holds 

the final voltage and buffers for outside use and a feed-back circuit 
(92) to make the reference voltage insensitive to other circuit 

components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to artificial 
cardiac pacemakers, and more particularly to an implantable 
bradycardia pacemaker having switched capacitor amplifier 
circuits for various functions, including sensing of cardiac 
activity, providing a voltage reference in conjunction with 
such sensing, and voltage regulation. In the normal human heart, the sinoatrial (S-A) node 
is the primary natural pacemaker by which rhythmic electrical 
excitation is developed. The cardiac impulse generated at 
the S-A node is transmitted to the atrial chambers at the 
right and left sides of the heart. In response, the atria 
contract, pumping blood from those chambers into the 
respective ventricular chambers. The impulse is transmitted 
to the ventricles through the atrioventricular (A-V) node, 
which imposes a delay, and via a conduction system comprising 
the bundle of His, the right and left bundle branches, and 
the Purkinje fibers. In response, the ventricles contract, 
the right ventricle pumping unoxygenated blood through the 
pulmonary artery to the lungs and the left ventricle pumping 
oxygenated (arterial) blood through the aorta and the lesser 
arteries to the body. The right atrium receives the venous (unoxygenated) 
blood from the upper part of the body (head, neck and chest)  
 
via the superior vena cava, or upper great vein, and from the 
lower part of the body (abdomen and legs) via the inferior 
vena cava, or lower great vein. The blood oxygenated by the 
lungs is carried via the pulmonary veins to the left atrium. This action is repeated in a rhythmic cardiac cycle 
in which the atrial and ventricular chambers alternately 
contract and pump, then relax and fill. One-way valves along 
the veins, between the atrial and ventricular chambers in the 
right and left sides of the heart (the tricuspid valve and 
the mitral valve, respectively), and at the exits of the 
right and left ventricles (the pulmonary and aortic valves, 
respectively) prevent backflow of the blood as it moves 
through the heart and the circulatory system. The S-A node is spontaneously rhythmic, and the 
normal cardiac rhythm originating there from is termed sinus 
rhythm. Disruption of the natural pacemaking and propagation 
system occurs as a result of aging or disease, and is 
commonly treated by artificial cardiac pacing. The 
artificial pacemaker is implanted to deliver rhythmic 
electrical to the heart as necessary to effect stimulation at 
the desired rate. Bradycardia pacers are designed to sense 
cardiac
