<ABSTRACT>
A dermatologic preparation composition containing 
as the active ingredient a prostacyclin represented by general 

formula (I) and/or an enantiomer thereof, wherein R¹ represents 

hydrogen, C₁-C₁₀ linear or branched alkyl, or a monovalent 
cation; R² represents -CH₂-CH₂-R²¹ (wherein R²¹ 

represents optionally substituted C₁-C₁₀ linear or branched 
alkyl, or optionally substituted C₂-C₁₀ linear or branched 

alkenyl or alkynyl) or optionally substituted C₃-C₁₀ cycloalkyl; 
and R³ and R⁴ represent each independently hydroxy 

or -OC( = O)R⁵, wherein R⁵ represents C₁-C₅ linear 
or branched alkyl.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an external skin 
treatment agent composition. More specifically, it 
relates to an external skin treatment agent composition 
containing a prostacyclin derivative as an active 
ingredient. Prostaglandins are compounds which have diverse 
physiological actions such as a powerful action in 
suppressing blood platlet aggregation, action in reducing 
the vasodilation blood pressure, action in suppressing 
gastric acid secretion, smooth muscle contraction action, 
cell protection action, and diuretic action and is useful 
for the treatment or prevention of myocardial infarct, 
cardiac angina, arteriosclerosis, hypertension, duodenal 
ulcers, induced parturition, abortion, etc. On the other hand, in recent years, there has been a 
tendency toward an increase of skin ulcers, in 
particular, the decubitus ulcers known commonly as 
bedsores, along with the higher age of the subjects being 
treated for various ailments. For example, about 5% of 
the approximately 12 million senior citizens in Japan 
today, or 600,000 people, are bed-ridden. These people 
are said to suffer from decubitus ulcers at a high 
frequency. In the past, the treatment for skin ulcers, 
including decubitus ulcers, consisted of improvement of 
local conditions using antibiotics, antibacterial agents, 
ointments containing enzymes etc., skin cleaning 
solutions, or water absorbing polymer powders, wound 
covering agents, etc. These have been tried along with 
removal and mitigation of the pressure on the diseased 
sites, surgical debridement for removal of the destroyed 
tissue, treatment of systemic conditions by transfusions,  
 
intraintestinal nutrition, and IVH, but these treatments 
still cannot be said to be sufficiently effective. On the 
other hand, attempts have been made to apply 
prostaglandin E, prostaglandin F, and prostaglandin I₁ 
transdermal preparations to skin ulcers, including 
decubitus ulcers, for the purpose of improvement of skin 
ulcers by application to local areas, but the stability 
of the main medication, the release of the main 
medication from the ointment, the stimulus to the skin, 
and the efficacy have not always necessarily met clinical 
requirements. Natural prostacyclin, however, is a local hormone 
produced mainly by the hemangioendothelium in the body. 
Attempts have been made to make use of its powerful 
physiological activity, for example, its activity in 
suppressing aggregation of blood platlets, its 
vasodilation activity, etc. to use the same as a direct 
pharmaceu
