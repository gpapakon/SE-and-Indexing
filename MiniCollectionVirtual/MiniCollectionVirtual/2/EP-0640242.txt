<ABSTRACT>
A contact spring arrangement has an elongated contact spring (9) with a rigid connection leg (12) which extends approximately parallel to the contact spring and which conducts the switching current in a direction opposite to the contact spring. On the side opposite to the connection leg (12), the contact spring has a contact piece (14) which co-operates with an opposite counter-contact element (18) provided with a contact piece (16). The repulsion forces between the connection leg (12) and the contact spring (9) are thus so increased that no welding of the contacts occurs, even at the highest short circuit currents, provided that the width of the gap between the contact spring (9) and the connection leg (12) be at least 20 times larger than the average spring spacing in the gap, when the contact pieces are made of silver or a silver alloy.
