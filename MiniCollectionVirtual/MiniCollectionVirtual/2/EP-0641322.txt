<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESSES FOR PRODUCING α-PYRIDYL CARBINOLSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to processes for producing α-pyridyl carbinol compounds. More particularly, it relates to a process for producing an α-2-pyridyl α-aryl carbinol or α-4-pyridyl α-aryl carbinol by reacting a 2- or 4-cyanopyridine with an aromatic carbonyl compound. α-Pyridyl carbinol compounds, having the characteristic Py-C-OH grouping, where Py is a pyridyl group, have been widely studied and used in large quantities as intermediates in the production of antihistamines, for instance carbinoxamine, dioxylamine, Azacyclonol and the antihistamine terfenadine (Seldane®). To date, several processes for producing these α-pyridyl Garbinols have received substantial interest. For example, the "Emmert reaction" involves a reaction of pyridine and ketones in the presence of a magnesium or aluminum amalgam. The reaction product includes a mixture of 2- and 4-pyridyl carbinols together with pinacols formed as byproducts. See, e.g., B. Emmert and E. Asendorf, Ber. , 72, 1188 (1939); B. Emmert and E. Pirot, ____, ALL, 714 (1941); and C.H. Tilford, R.S. Shelton and M.G. Van Ca pen, Jr., J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 70. 4001 (1948). In the "Hammick reaction", α-pyridyl carbinols are produced by decarboxylation of picolinic acid in an excess of aldehyde or ketone. See, e.g. P. Dyson and D.L. Hammick, J. Chem. Soc, 1724 (1937); and K. Mislow, J. Am. Chem. Soc. , __, 2559 (1947). α-Pyridyl carbinols can also be prepared either by the action of pyridyl Grignard reagents on aldehydes or ketones, 

 see, e.g., J.P. Wibaut and L.G. Heeringa, Recueil. 74., 1003 (1955); N. Furukawa, T. Shibutani, K. Matsumura, H. Fujihara, and S. Oae, Tetrahedron Lett.. 27. 3899 (1986), or by the action of aryl Grignard reagents on pyridyl aldehydes, ketones or esters, see, e.g., A.E. Tschitschibabin and S. W. Benewolenskaja, Ber. , 61, 547 (1928); Y. Kasuya and K. Fujie, Yakuσaku Zasshi.. 78, 551 (1958) [Chem. Abstr., _Z, 17196i (1958)]; and K. Nagarajan, P.K. Talwalker, R.K. Shah and S.J. Shenoy, Indian J. Chem.. Sect. B, 24B. 112 (1985). The diphenyl ketyl radical has been reported to undergo substitution reactions with cyano-substituted pyridinium ions to form α-pyridinium substituted carbinols. B.M. Vittimberga, F. Minisci and S. Morrocchi, J. Am. Chem. Soc. , 97, 4397 (1975), reports such interactions in 1 M sulfuric acid where the diphenyl ketyl radical was photochemically generated. In later work, P. McDevitt and B.M. Vittimberga, J. Heterocyclic Chem.,
