An intermediate piece for connecting and lengthening
wrenches, with the intermediate piece (1) being designed as

an external polygon (3) along the axis (2) of the
intermediate piece, with the external polygon (3) being

arranged symmetrically with the axis (2) of the
intermediate piece, and essentially disk-shaped stop

elements (4) are provided for securing and aligning the
wrenches (7, 9) added onto the intermediate piece (2), said

wrenches standing transversely to the axis (2) of the
intermediate piece and projecting at least slightly outward

beyond the outside circumference of the external polygon
(3) at a right angle to the axis (2) of the intermediate

piece, characterized in that the stop elements (4) have
magnetically active faces (6), with the magnetization of

each of the stop elements (4) being such that each of the
added wrenches (7, 9) forms a magnetic return path in the

magnetic field of the stop element (4) adjacent to the
added wrench (7, 9), and the magnetic field is oriented

locally such that each of the added wrenches (7, 9) is
secured to prevent it from sliding off laterally.
An intermediate piece according to claim 1, characterized
in that it comprises an internal polygon which

extends along and symmetrical to the axis (2) of the
intermediate piece.
An intermediate piece according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the stop elements

(4) are formed on the free ends (5) of the intermediate
piece (1).
An intermediate piece according to one of claims 1
through 2, characterized in that the stop elements (4) are

arranged in the middle area of the intermediate piece (1). 
An intermediate piece according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that boreholes in which

magnets are placed are provided in the stop elements (4).
An intermediate piece according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the stop elements

(4) are round.
An intermediate piece according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that several internal or

external polygons (3) in different wrench sizes are
provided in gradations along the axis (2) of the

intermediate piece.
An intermediate piece according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the intermediate

piece (1) consists of several individual parts along the
axis (2) of the intermediate axis, the individual parts are

mounted so they can rotate relative to one another about
the axis (2) of the intermediate axis, and an adjustable

lock (7) for the direction of rotation is provided between
the individual parts.
An intermediate piece according to one of the
preceding cases, characterized in that the internal or

external polygon (3) is a square or a hexagon.
An intermediate piece according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the intermediate

piece (1) has a longitudinal bore (8) that runs along the
axis (2) of the intermediate piece and has an inside thread

or contains a threaded rod.
