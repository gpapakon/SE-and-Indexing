<ABSTRACT>
A refrigerating system in which a refrigeration fluid 
medium is flowing in a closet circuit comprising a 

compressor (11), a condenser (14), a receiver (15) 
for containing the refrigeration fluid in a liquid 

state, and an evaporator (19) serially connected 
between the outlet side and the intake side of the 

compressor (11); the improvement consisting in a 
cooling device for the compressor (11), comprising an 

auxiliary flow path (22) for circulation of the 
refrigeration fluid, branched-off between the fluid 

receiver (15) and the intake-side of the compressor 
(11) and provided with a flow restrictor (22', 22'', 

25). Pressure sensing means (23) are provided on the 
intake side (20) to provide a control signal in 

absence of the liquid fluid in the receiver (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a refrigerating
system according to preamble of claim 1, particularly but not exclusively suitable
for air conditioning of cars, vehicles, boats and similar
applications in which the refrigerating system is
usually subjected to vibrations and mechanical
stresses which could cause the failure of the system,
by losses of gas or preventing the circulation of the
refrigeration medium, and consequently the
overheating of the refrigeration compressor.Refrigeration systems for cars air conditioning
usually comprise a compressor, a condenser, a
receiver for containing a liquefied refrigeration
fluid, and an evaporator serially connected each
others and between the outlet side and the intake
side of the same refrigeration compressor, as well as
comprise control means to avoid compressor
overheating.The presently existing control systems for avoiding
the overheating of refrigeration compressors, usually
comprise thermostatically actuated safety devices for
sensing the temperature of the compressor allowing 
the circulation of a flow of refrigerant for cooling
the compressor. According to the operation mode, at
a preset temperature the thermostatic control device
starts allowing a flow of refrigerant from the fluid
receiver to the intake side of the compressor to
avoid overheating; nevertheless a thermostatic
control system does not save the compressor from
overheating as soon as a leakage of gas in the
refrigeration circuit will not allow the liquefied
refrigerant in the receiver to be sufficiently fed to
the compressor and to the same thermostatic control
device. In this event, the compressor will be no
longer cooled and overheating will start. Because of
that, the thermostatic control device totally opens
and a flow of refrigerant in gas state will not cool
the compressor which therefore will break-down. For
this reason of for cost reasons said thermally
controlled safety devices and similar
electronically controlled devices, are complex all involving
relevant costs and are not used in economical
refrigerating systems, such as in air conditioning
of cars, vehicles, boats and the like. US-A-4 300 357 is the more relevant document showing
the known prior art. US-A-4 300 357 relates to a by-pass
valve device for an automotive air conditioning
system, comprising a pressure responsive control
valve between the low and high pressure sides of the
system, to save energy when insufficient refrigerant
is fed back to the compressor; no pressure control at
the intake side of the compressor

<CLAIMS>
A refrigeration system for air conditioners, in
which a liquefied refrigerant is circulated at an

operative pressure (P2) in a closed refrigeration
circuit comprising a compressor (11), a condenser

(14), a receiver (15) for collecting the liquefied
refrigerant from the condenser (14), and an

evaporator (19) serially connected to each other and
between the outlet side (13) and intake side (20) of the

compressor (11); and an auxiliary cooling device for
the compressor (11), said auxiliary cooling device

comprising a branched-off path (22', 22'') for
circulation of liquefied refrigerant from the

receiver (15) to the intake side (20) of the compressor
(11); a throttling valve

(25) being provided in said branched-off path (22',
22''), and pressure sensing means (26)

compressor (11) to operate said throttling valve (25)

and to allow circulation of liquefied
refrigerant from said receiver (15) to said

compressor intake (20), characterised in that said throttling
valve (25) and said first pressure sensing means

comprise in combination:

a valve body (32) having a valve chamber (34) and
a pressure actuated yielding membrane (35) sealingly provided in said 

valve chamber (34) between an upper and a bottom
side; the upper side of said valve chamber (34) being

connected to the atmosphere (42) while the bottom
side of the valve chamber (34) being connected to the

compressor intake (20) to provide said first pressure
sensing means (26);
and a closed cavity (36) in the valve body (32),
said closed cavity (36) being connected to the bottom

of the receiver (15) by a capillary pipe (22'),
respectively being connected to the intake side (20)

of the compressor (11) by a flow path (43) provided
in said throttling valve

(25); a bore in the valve body (32) axially extending
between the bottom side of the valve chamber (34) and

said closed cavity (36), and a valve member (38)
slidingly movable in said axial bore between

retracted and an advanced positions respectively to
close and to open said flow path (43);
counteracting spring means (40, 41) being
provided at opposite ends of the valve member (38),

said spring means (40, 41) and said membrane (35)
conjointly acting on said valve member (38) to open

said flow path (43) for circulating a metered flow

the compressor intake side (20) when the
suction force sensed by the membrane (35) at the bottom side of the

valve chamber
