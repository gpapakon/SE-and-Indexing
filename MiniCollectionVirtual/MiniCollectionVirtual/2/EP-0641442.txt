<ABSTRACT>
This invention presents novel assay devices employing a capture reagent, involving a specific binding member attached to a charged substance, and a porous material containing a capture or reaction zone that is oppositely charged with respect to the capture reagent. In one embodiment, a test sample suspected of containing the analyte of interest is contacted with the capture reagent to form a charged capture reagent/analyte complex. The complex is then contacted to the oppositely charged capture or reaction zone to attract, attach, and immobilize the capture reagent/analyte complex. With an appropriate indicator reagent, both sandwich and competitive assays can be performed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of binding assay devices and 
methods. In particular, the present invention relates to novel devices useful in 
the performance of homogeneous immunoassays. Various analytical procedures and devices are commonly employed in 
assays to determine the presence and/or concentration of substances of interest or 
clinical significance which may be present in biological liquids or other 
materials. Such substances are commonly termed "analytes" and can include 
antibodies, antigens, drugs, hormones, etc. Immunoassay techniques take advantage of the mechanisms of the immune 
systems of higher organisms, wherein antibodies are produced in response to the 
presence of antigens which are pathogenic or foreign to the organisms. These 
antibodies and antigens, i.e., immunoreactants, are capable of binding with one 
another, thereby creating a highly specific reaction mechanism which can be used 
in vitro to determine the presence or concentration of that particular antigen in a 
biological sample. There are several known immunoassay methods using immunoreactants, 
wherein at least one of the immunoreactants is labeled with a detectable 
component so as to be analytically identifiable. For example, the "sandwich" or 
"two-site" technique may involve the formation of a ternary complex between an 
antigen and two antibodies. A convenient method of detecting complex formation in 
such a technique is to provide one labeled antibody and an unlabeled antibody bound 
to a solid phase support such that the complex can readily be isolated. In this 
example, the amount of labeled antibody associated with the solid phase is directly 
proportional to the amount of analyte in the test sample. An alternative technique is the "competitive" assay. In one example of a 
competitive assay, the capture mechanism again may use an antibody attached to  
 
an insoluble solid phase, but a labeled analyte (rather than a labeled antibody) 
competes with the analyte present in the test sample for binding to the 
immobilized antibody. Similarly, an immobilized analyte can compete with the 
analyte of interest for a labeled antibody. In these competitive assays, the 
quantity of captured labeled reagent is inversely proportional to the amount of 
analyte present in the sample. Despite their great utility, there are disadvantages with such assay 
methods. First, the heterogenous reaction mixture of liquid test sample and 
soluble and insoluble assay reagents, can retard the kinetics of the reaction.
