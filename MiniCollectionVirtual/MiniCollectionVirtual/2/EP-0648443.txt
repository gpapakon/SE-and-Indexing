<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for continuously inspecting the attached 
states of successive bottom stop boxes attached to separable 

slide fasteners, comprises a pair of tape grip members (4) 
movable forwardly and backwardly along a travelling path of 

a fastener tape (T) to which the individual bottom stop box 
is attached. The tape grip members (4) are situated upwardly 

and downwardly of the fastener tape travelling path in confronting 
relationship, each of which being pivotally movable 

about the horizontal axis extending through its central 
portion. The tape grip members (4) have urging means (7) 

for normally urging their upstream ends toward each other, 
and forced turning means (11) for forcedly turning their 

downstream ends toward and away from each other. The 
apparatus further comprises a moving body (6) situated on 

one side of the grip members (4) for moving forwardly and 
backwardly together with the grip members (4), a contact 

member (8) situated in a fixed position in a path of movement 
of the moving body (6) and normally urged toward the 

moving body (6) by a predetermined resilience, and detecting 
means (9) for detecting an amount of movement of the grip 

members (4) when the moving body (6) is moved to a predetermined 
length against the predetermined resilience in contact 

with the contact member (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for continuously
inspecting the degree of firmness with which an individual
bottom stop box is attached to a separable slide fastener,
and a separable slide fastener bottom stop box attaching
machine, for a separable slide fastener manufacturing system,
which is equipped with the inspecting apparatus.U.S. Patent No. 4,671,122 discloses an apparatus for
inspecting the attached state of a separable slide fastener
bottom stop box by inserting inspecting projections into
notches which are clinched previously to attach the bottom
stop box to a box pin and then detecting the depth of insertion
after the box pin fixed to one fastener tape and an
insertion pin fixed to the other fastener tape are inserted
into a metallic box and, at the same time, the notches are
clinched.A method of attaching a thermoplastic synthetic resin
box by ultrasonic welding is disclosed in Japanese Patent
Publication No. SHO 63-40088. In the attaching method, the
welded state of the box and the box pin are inspected in
terms of melting and smashing of the projection previously 
formed on the box surface.In the method for inspection in terms of depth of
clinching notches, since the notches are deformed after the
box has been attached, the appearance of the resulting
separable bottom stop would be remarkably deteriorated.
On the other hand, in the method for inspection in terms of
degree of melting and smashing of the projection, partly
since the melted projection on the box surface deteriorates
the appearance of the separable bottom stop, and partly
since the attached state of the box is estimated indirectly
from the degree of melting and smashing of the projection,
reliable inspection is difficult to achieve.It is an object of this invention to provide an
inspecting apparatus for directly inspecting the degree of
firmness of attachment of a separable slide fastener bottom
stop box without deteriorating its appearance after attaching
the box, and a separable slide fastener bottom stop box attaching
machine equipped with the inspecting apparatus for
reliably grasping the attached state of the box.In order to accomplish the above object, according
to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided an
apparatus for continuously inspecting the attached states
of successive bottom stop boxes attached to separable slide
fasteners, comprising a pair of tape grip members movable
forwardly and backwardly along a travelling path of a fastener 
tape to which the individual bottom stop box is attached.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for continuously inspecting the
attached states of successive bottom stop boxes attached to

separable slide fasteners, comprising: a pair of tape grip
members (4) movable forwardly and backwardly along a travelling

path of a fastener tape (T) to which the individual
bottom stop box (P) is attached, said tape grip members (4)

being situated upwardly and downwardly of the fastener tape
travelling path in confronting relationship, each of said

tape grip members (4) being pivotally movable about the
horizontal axis extending through its central portion, said

tape grip members (4) having urging means (10) for normally
urging their upstream ends toward each other; and forced

turning means (11) for forcedly turning their downstream
ends toward and away from each other; a moving body (6)

situated on one side of said grip members (4) for moving
forwardly and backwardly together with said grip members (4);

a contact member (8) situated in a fixed position in a path
of movement of said moving body (6) and normally urged toward

said moving body (6) by a predetermined resilience; and
detecting means (9) for detecting an amount of movement of

said grip members (4) when said moving body (6) is moved to
a predetermined length against said predetermined resilience

in contact with said contact member (8).
A separable slide fastener bottom stop box attaching
machine equipped with an inspecting apparatus as defined in

claim 1, said machine comprising: a pair of gripping tips (4a) 
on respective upstream ends of said grip members (4) for

gripping the fastener tapes (T) from their upper and lower
sides; a movement restricting member (13) for restricting

the upstream movement of said grip members (4); forward
feeding means (15) situated downstream of said grip members

(4) for forwardly feeding the fastener chain (C) intermittently;
a box attaching unit (14) situated near to and

upstream of said movement restricting member (13); backward
feeding means (16) situated upstream of said box attaching

unit (14); and controlling means for actuating said
forced turning means (11) to cause said gripping tips (4a)

to forcedly grip the fastener tapes while the box is supplied
to said box attaching unit (14), and also for actuating said

backward feeding means (16) and opening said gripping tips
(4a) when the box is attached to the fastener tapes.
