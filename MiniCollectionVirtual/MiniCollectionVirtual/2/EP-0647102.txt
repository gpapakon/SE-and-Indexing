<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for processing materials constituted by or containing dried or mechanically dewatered beetroot shavings into fodder. The material is pressed by a conveyor element against the outlet end of a container, so that an increased pressure is there exercised on the material at the same time as the temperature is increased, and is there pressed out of the container through an outlet (28) whose passage cross-section can be changed or closed by a counter-pressure element (29).

Method for processing a raw material to produce fodder, 
in which the raw material is compressed in a housing by a 

conveying member located therein towards the discharge end of the 
housing, so that with a simultaneous temperature increase at this 

point, an increased pressure acting on the material results and 
it is pushed out of the housing through a discharge opening, 

which can be varied in its cross-section of passage and can be 
closed by a counter-pressure member, characterised in that as the 

raw material one uses material consisting of dried or 
mechanically drained beetroot shavings or material containing 

dried or mechanically drained beetroot shavings, to which is 
added a liquid afterproduct from the foodstuffs and/or fodder 

industry, before the treatment in the housing. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
discharge opening may have its cross-section adjusted and 

regulated. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
an annular gap is used as the discharge opening. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
a flat gap is used as the discharge opening. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
a perforated gap is used as the discharge opening. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
a perforated disc is used as the discharge opening. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that a worm conveyor is used as the conveying member. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised 
in that the housing is heated.  

 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised 
in that the material in the housing is treated with water vapour. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised 
in that after leaving the discharge opening, the material is 

divided into sections. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 10, characterised 
in that after leaving the discharge opening, the material is 

pelletised. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 11, characterised 
in that molasses are added as the liquid afterproduct. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 12, characterised 
in that vinasse is added as the liquid afterproduct. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 13, characterised 
in that spent wash and dairy by-products are added as liquid 

afterproducts. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 14, characterised 
in that fat is added as the liquid afterproduct. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 15, characterised 
in that before treatment in the housing, decomposing agents in 

the form of acids, lyes, volatile bases are added to the 
material. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 16, characterised 
in that the liquid afterproduct is added in a quantity which 

corresponds to up to 100% by weight of the dry shavings. 
Method according to Claim 17, characterised in that the 
liquid afterproduct is added in a quantity which corresponds to 

approximately 40 to 70% by weight of the dry shavings.  
 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 18, characterised 
in that extracted beetroot shavings are processed. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 18, characterised 
in that non-extracted beetroot shavings are processed.
