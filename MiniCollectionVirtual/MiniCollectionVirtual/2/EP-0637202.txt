<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a liquid pesticidal formulation which comprises at least one pesticidal compound, one or more pesticidally acceptable carriers and as a crystallisation inhibitor a) a polyhydroxylated aromatic compound, b) a monohydroxylated aromatic compound, in which the aromatic ring is substituted by halo, alkoxy, nitro, carboxy, cyano or by optionally substituted phenyl in a position ortho to the hydroxy, c) an amino substituted aromatic compound, or d) an aliphatic carboxylic acid of chain length 1 to 8 carbon atoms, comprising one to three carboxy groups, and optionally substituted by hydroxy.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel formulations of 
pesticides. Pesticides are commonly formulated as emulsifiable 
concentrates, in which the active ingredient is dissolved 
in an organic solvent, such as xylene and mixed with 
various emulsifying and wetting agents, whereby the 
resulting concentrate, on dilution with water, forms an 
emulsion of the pesticide in water which can then be 
sprayed, e.g. onto crops. It is now becoming increasingly desirable for 
environmental, safety and/or cost reasons, that part at 
least of the organic solvent in such formulations is 
replaced by water. One way of achieving this would be to 
have a concentrate comprising the pesticide in a reduced 
amount of water-immiscible solvent, or even no solvent at 
all, which is emulsified in water. However, when trying to 
form concentrates of this type, some pesticides, 
especially those which are low-melting solids, tend to 
crystallise on standing and such formulations cannot be 
re-constituted to give a product of uniform concentration. 
Thus even if the farmer can remove crystals which would 
otherwise rapidly clog up spraying apparatus, he is left 
with a formulation which cannot be applied uniformly to 
his crop and is therefore wholly unacceptable. This 
problem is particularly acute with the fungicide having 
the common name prochloraz, which is N-propyl-N-[2-(2,4,6-trichlorophenoxy)ethyl]imidazole-1-carboxamide.  
 In EP 357 559, there are disclosed aqueous formulations of 
pesticides which have a very low solubility in water. The 
formulation consists of an aqueous emulsion and contains 
particular phenols in order to stabilise the emulsion and 
prevent crystallisation of the pesticide. We have now found that certain other aromatic compounds 
are particlarly valuable in inhibiting the crystallisation 
of a pesticide from a liquid formulation. Thus, according to the invention, there is provided a 
liquid pesticidal formulation which comprises a pesticidal 
compound, one or more pesticidally acceptable carriers and 
as a crystallisation inhibitor, benzene containing two or 
three hydroxy groups and substituted by one or more lower 
alkyl groups. The invention is particularly applicable to oil in water 
emulsion formulations which also comprise one or more 
surfactants and/or emulsion stabilisers.  
 The invention can also be applied to other formulation 
types, such as microemulsions and emulsifiable 
concentrates. The invention also applies to co-formulations. This is 
particularly applicable to formulations containing
