<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cryogenic liquid pump equipped with a pump body actuated by a drive assembly and incorporated inside a reservoir of cryogenic liquid, this removable pump body (10) being able to slide in a well (12) and be made to communicate selectively with the reservoir (16) by a first valve (24, 110) which, in the open position, allows liquid to transfer from the reservoir to the pump body before it is discharged in the form of a liquid or a gas via an outlet orifice (60) and, via a second valve (26, 260) allowing, when opened, a flow of cold gas from the gaseous ceiling of this reservoir towards a rear end (28) of the pump body from which it is then discharged to the outside via a bleed/purge orifice (64). Preferably this bleed/purge orifice (64) is equipped at the outlet with a device (62) for adjusting the cold gaseous flow rate leaving the pump body (10).

Cryogenic liquid pump provided with a pump body and 
driven by a motor assembly and integrated in a cryogenic liquid tank, 

characterized in that said pump body is removable (10) and can be put 
selectively in communication with the tank (16) by sliding in a well (12), 

a first non-retum valve (24, 110) making it possible when in the open 
position to transfer liquid from the tank to the pump body prior to 

evacuation thereof in the form of a liquid or a gas via an outlet orifice 
(60), and a second non-return valve (26, 260) making it possible, when 

in the open position, to establish a flow of cold gas from the gas 
overhead of the tank towards a rear end (28) of the pump body from 

which it is exhausted to the outside via a sweeping/venting orifice (64). 
Cryogenic liquid pump according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the sweeping/venting orifice (64) is provided at its outlet with a device 

(62) for adjusting the flow rate of cold gas leaving the pump body (10). 
Cryogenic liquid pump according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the first and second non-return valves (24, 26) are put 

in the open position during installation and fastening of the pump body in 
the well by means of a double-headed driver (22) fixed at a front end (38) of 

said pump body and acting on each of said non-return valves in order to 
cause them to open. 
Cryogenic liquid pump according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the second non-retum valve (260) is put into the open 

position while the pump body is being installed and fastened in the well by 
means of a driver (220) fixed to a front end of the pump body that causes 

the non-retum valve to open, and in that the first non-retum valve (110) is 
put into the open position by a control device (120) external to the pump 

body. 
Cryogenic liquid pump according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that it includes sealing devices (40, 76) placed respectively 

between the well and the pump body, and between the well and the outside. 
Cryogenic liquid pump according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the pump body is coupled to a sealed motor (46) the 

assembly constituted by said two elements being isolated from the outside 
by a sealed link (54) that connects them together.  

 
Cryogenic liquid pump according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the pump body is coupled to a motor (400) having an 

immersed rotor, the stator (470) being separated from the rotor (460) by a 
sealed jacket (480) secured to the pump body. 
Cryogenic liquid pump according to claim 6 or claim 7, 
characterized in that the sealed partition (54, 480) includes a venting orifice. 
Cryogenic liquid pump according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
integrated in a double-walled tank (16), and characterized in that the pump 

body (10) is mounted on the inside wall (14) of the tank, a sealed link (72) 
connecting the outside wall (70) of the tank to the side wall of the well and 

making it possible to leave the space (74) between the walls at the vacuum 
pressure to which it is subjected prior to installing the pump.
