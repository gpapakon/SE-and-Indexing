<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method of drying a paper web, in which method the
paper web is on support of a drying wire without substantially long open draws of the
web over the length of the portion of the web that is being dried.Further, the invention concerns a drying module for the dryer section of a paper-making
machine, which module is intended in particular for dryer sections of high-speed
paper machines, whose running speed is v ≈ 25...40 m/s, and which
drying module includes a drying-wire loop guided by guide rolls, drying cylinders,
and by a reversing suction roll.Further, the invention concerns a dryer section comprising drying modules
mentioned above.The pre-characterizing clauses of claims 1 and 17 are based on document
EP-A-0 383 744.The highest web speeds in paper machines are currently already of an order of 25 m/s,
but, before long, the speed range of 25...40 m/s will be taken
into use. Then, a bottle-neck in the runnability of a paper machine will be the dryer
section, whose length with the use of the prior-art multi-cylinder dryers would
additionally become intolerably long. If a present-day multi-cylinder
dryer were operated at a web speed of 40 m/s, it would comprise about 70
drying cylinders, and its length in the machine direction would be about 180 m. In
such a case, the dryer would comprise about 20 different wire groups and a corresponding
number of group-gap draws. It can be assumed that, in a speed range of
30...40 m/s, the runnability of normal prior-art multi-cylinder dryers would not be
even nearly satisfactory, but there would be a great number of web breaks, which 
lowers the efficiency of the paper machine.In a speed range of 30...40 m/s and at higher speeds, the prior-art multi-cylinder
dryers would also become uneconomical, because the investment cost of an excessively
long paper machine hall would become unduly high. It can be estimated that the
cost of a paper machine hall is currently typically about 1 million FIM per metre in
the machine direction.In a paper machine hall, space is usually available in the direction of height, and so
it has been suggested that the cylinders in a multi-cylinder dryer be arranged in
vertical stacks, but in such a case, especially with high speeds, the problems of
runnability and broke removal are emphasized and are likely to be very difficult to
solve in the speed range of 30...40 m/s. With respect to this prior art, reference is
made to document EP-A-0 383 744,
corresponding to document FI-B-82097.One parameter that illustrates the
