<ABSTRACT>
An expander tool (1) for hollow work pieces has a tool main body (2) with a first hand lever (3), a hole (4), an expansion mandrel (5) which can be displaced axially in the latter and projects with an outward-tapering end (5a) into an exchangeable expansion head (12) with radially moveable expansion jaws (12a), and a second hand lever (10), which can be pivoted about a pivoting axis (S) in a recess (8) in the tool main body (2). When the lever is operated, the expansion mandrel (5) is moved in both directions relative to the main body. To increase the opening travel of the expansion jaws while retaining the opening angle of the end (5a) of the expansion mandrel unaltered, the following measures are taken:   a) at its other end (5b), the end opposite the hand levers (3, 10), the expansion mandrel (5) is designed as a rack (6) and, on the remainder of its circumference, has a cylindrical surface (7) which is supported in the hole (4), and b) at its end supported in the recess (8) in the tool main body (2), the moveable hand lever (10) is connected to a toothing (9) concentric with the pivoting axis (S) and engaging in the rack.

Expander tool (1) for hollow, in particular hollow-cylindrical 
workpieces, comprising a tool body (2) with a first rigidly thereto 

attached hand lever (3), with a bore (4), a therein axially 
displaceably mounted expanding mandrel (5) which extends from 

the bore with an outwardly narrowed end (5a) into an expander 
head (12) which is exchangeable relative to the expander mandrel 

with radially movable expanding jaws (12a), and with a second 
hand lever (10) which is mounted in a cutout (8) of the tool body 

(2) so as to be pivotal around a pivot axis (S) and connected to 
the expanding mandrel (5) to be driven in such a manner that the 

expanding mandrel (5) is, on operation of the second hand lever 
(10) between an approximately rectangular and an at least 

virtually parallel position of both hand levers (3, 10), movable in 
both directions around a specified lift relative to the tool body (2),
characterised in that
a) the expanding mandrel (5) is at its end (5b), which is facing 
away from the narrowed end (5a), on the one side opposite the 

rigidly mounted hand lever (3) provided with a straight toothing, 
thus being arranged as a toothed rod (6) parallel to the bore 

axis (A-A), and at the side facing away from the toothing 
provided with a cylinder surface (7) which is guided in the axial 

bore (4) of the tool body (2); 
b) the movable hand lever (10) is, at its end which is mounted in 
the cutout (8) of the tool body (2) at the side of the expanding 

mandrel (5) which is facing away from the rigidly mounted hand 
lever (3), connected to a toothing (9), which is concentric to the 

pivot axis (S) and complementary to the toothed rod (6) and 
engaging the toothed rod (6); and 
c) the movable hand lever (10) is L-shaped and provided with a 
shorter (10a) and a longer shank (10b), so that the end of the 

shorter shank (10a) is provided with the concentric toothing (9) 
and the longer shank (10b), which comprises a grab end (10c), 

reaches over the obtuse end of the expanding mandrel (5b). 
Expander tool according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
end of the movable hand lever (10), which is mounted in the tool 

body (2), including the concentric toothing (9), are essentially 
arranged as a plateshaped assembly component and mounted in 

the cutout (8) which is laterally defined by parallel walls. 
Expander tool according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
longer shank (10b) of the movable hand lever (10) comprises a 

stop (10d) by means of which the hand lever (10) supports itself, 
at the end of an expanding movement with at least virtually 

parallel alignment of both hand levers (3, 10) relative to each 
other, against the tool body (2). 
Expander tool according to Claim 1, 
characterised by
 a lift of the 
expanding mandrel (5) of at least 15 mm, preferably at least 18 

mm, at an opening angle of the expanding mandrel end (5) of 18° 
and an operating angle of the movable hand lever (10) of 90°.
