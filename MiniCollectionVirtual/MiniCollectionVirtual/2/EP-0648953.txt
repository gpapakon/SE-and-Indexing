<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a metal torsion bar (1) for vehicle suspension including a straight central part (2) which has a circular cross section, the said central part extending longitudinally between two fixing heads (3) designed to be fixed rigidly to other mechanical members, the said torsion (roll) bar being hardened by pretorsion and at least the central part (2) of the torsion bar exhibiting an annular cross section. According to the invention, the cross section of the said central part has a radially external plasticised region (4) which has been plastically deformed by pretorsion, and a radially internal elastic region (5) which has been deformed elastically by the pretorsion, the cross section of the central part of the torsion bar having a total surface area S and the plasticised region having a surface area Sp such that their ratio Sp/S is at least equal to 0.5 and at most equal to 0.6.

Metal torsion bar (1), including a straight 
central part (2) which extends longitudinally between two 

fixing heads (3) suitable for being rigidly fixed to other 
mechanical members, at least the central part (2) of the 

torsion bar having a circular annular cross-section, 
characterized in that said torsion bar is work-hardened by 

pretwisting and in that the cross-section of the said 
central part (2) has a radially outside plasticized section 

(4), which has been deformed plastically by the pretwisting, 
and a radially inside elastic zone (5), which has been 

deformed elastically by the pretwisting, the annular cross-section 
of the central part of the torsion bar having a 

total area S and the plasticized zone having an area Sp such 
that the ratio Sp/S is at least equal to 0.5 and at most 

equal to 0.6. 
Torsion bar according to claim 1, in which at 
least the central part (2) has an inside surface (8) from 

which extends radially an annular zone (7) subjected to 
residual compressive stresses, said zone (7) having a radial 

thickness at least equal to 0.3 mm. 
Method of manufacturing a metal torsion bar (1), 
including a straight central part (2) which extends longitudinally 

between two fixing heads (3) suitable for being 

rigidly fixed to other mechanical members, at least the 
central part (2) of the torsion bar having a circular 

annular cross-section and thus having an inside surface (8), 
this method being characterized in that it includes the 

successive steps consisting in : 

work-hardening a tubular torsion bar by subjecting 
it to a pretorque whose value is chosen so that the cross-section 

of the central part (2) of the torsion bar has a 
radially outside plasticized zone (4), deformed plastically 

by the pretwisting, and a radially inside elastic zone (5), 
deformed elastically by the pretwisting, the annular cross-section  

 
of the central part of the torsion bar having a 

total area S and the plasticized zone having an area Sp such 
that the ratio Sp/S is at least equal to 0.5 and at most 

equal to 0.6, and 
subjecting the inside surface (8) of at least the 
central part (2) of the torsion bar to shot peening sufficient 

to create residual compressive stresses to a radial 
thickness of at least 0.3 mm from the said inside surface. 
Method according to claim 3, in which the fixing 
heads (3) are formed by upset forging starting from a 

cylindrical tube (10).
