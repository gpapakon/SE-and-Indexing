<ABSTRACT>
In a cylindrical drum (1) for stencil printing which 
consists of a porous cylindrical plate (2) and a screen layer 

(3), in which a stencil sheet (4) is attached to the outer surface 
of the screen layer having an ink permeability, an ink 

is supplied (10-13) from the inner surface of the porous cylindrical 
body which rotates around its own central axis, the present 

invention provides a screen layer consisting of a woven 
fabric of conjugated fibers of a sheath-and-core or a 

side-by-side type consisting of a lower melting component 
and a higher melting component and making the intersections 

of the fibers fixed together through the melt-adhesion 
of the lower melting point component by means of 

thermocompression bonding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cylindrical drum 
for stencil printing. Specifically, it relates to a 
cylindrical drum for stencil printing which is suitable 
for controlling ink transferability, etc., in 
a rotary type stencil printing machine. A stencil printing method has an advantage in that 
a plurality of printed copies can thereby be obtained 
more economically in comparison with the costs of other 
printing methods. A rotary type stencil printing machine 
is known as a printing machine which is allowed to 
exert its advantage at maximum. The rotary type stencil printing machine has a porous 
cylindrical drum which rotates around its own axis. A 
stencil sheet is attached to the outer surface of the porous 
cylindrical drum; an ink being supplied from the inner surface 
of the porous cylindrical drum. As a cylindrical drum, 
there is known a drum, such as that which generally has 
a metallic supporting cylinder having numerous small pores, 
which may termed a porous cylindrical body, and a 
screen layer rolled around the outer surface of the 
supporting cylinder described above, that which directly  
 
rolls the screen layer cylindrically around a pair of 
flanges which are supported by a center rod without using 
the metallic supporting cylinder described above, and 
others. As a screen layer described above, in order to improve 
the ink transfer quality, a screen layer consisting of 
polyester fibers having a fine net structure, and a screen 
multi-layer composed of a lower mesh stainless screen and 
a higher mesh polyester fiber screen are known (Japanese 
Patent publication No. 63-59393 and Japanese Patent 
Application laid-open No. 3-254986). However, when the screen layer of a fine net structure 
is provided to the supporting cylinder, stitch deviation 
of the screen occurs readily. As a result, there is 
a disadvantage in that the small pores in the supporting 
cylinder appear as a shadow on the printed image. Further, 
in the case of a screen multi-layer, it is often 
inconvenient that for ink to be retained between the two 
layers. Also, in the drum having no supporting cylinder, 
since an ink supply roller built in the cylindrical drum 
is brought into direct contact with the screen, there are 
such problems that the printing ink cannot uniformly be 
supplied because the stitch deviation of the screen is 
large, the deflection thereof is easily yielded at the 
time of printing operation because the rigidity thereof 
is low, and the pressure distribution at the time  
 
of printing
