<ABSTRACT>
A continuous process for preparing a dialkylester of a naphthalenedicarboxylic acid comprising passing a liquid phase reaction mixture comprising a low molecular weight alcohol, a naphthalenedicarboxylic acid and a dialkylester of a naphthalenedicarboxylic acid at an elevated temperature through series arranged reaction zones (70, 71, 72, 73) while introducing a naphthalenedicarboxylic acid and a low molecular weight alcohol to an upstream reaction zone, agitating at least one reaction zone, and removing a liquid product mixture comprising the dialkylester of the naphthalenedicarboxylic acid produced by the reaction of the naphthalenedicarboxylic acid with the low molecular weight alcohol from a downstream reaction zone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing a dialkylester of a
naphthalenedicarboxylic acid. More particularly, this invention relates to an
improved process for preparing a dialkylester of a naphthalenedicarboxylic
acid by reacting a naphthalenedicarboxylic acid with a low molecular weight
alcohol at an elevated reaction temperature in series arranged reaction
zones under conditions which provide for high reaction rates and high
conversion of the naphthalenedicarboxylic acid to its diester without
excessive formation of side products.The diesters of naphthalenedicarboxylic acids are useful for
preparing a variety of polymeric materials such as polyesters and
polyamides. One particularly useful diester is dimethyl-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate
(DM-2,6-NDC). Dimethyl-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate,
for example, can be condensed with ethylene glycol to form
poly(ethylene-2,6-naphthalate) (PEN), a high performance polyester
material. Fibers and films made from PEN have considerably improved
strength and superior thermal properties relative to, for example,
poly(ethyleneterephthalate). For this reason, PEN is an exceptional material
for preparing commercial articles such as thin films which can be used in the
manufacture of magnetic recording tape and electronic components.
Additionally, because of its superior resistance to gas diffusion, and
particularly to the diffusion of carbon dioxide, oxygen and water vapor, films
made from PEN are useful for manufacturing food containers, especially the
so-called "hot fill" food containers. PEN can also be used to prepare high
strength fibers useful for the manufacture of, for example, tire cord.DM-2,6-NDC is most readily prepared by the esterification of 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic
acid (2,6-NDA) with methanol. The 2,6-NDA is
conveniently prepared by the liquid phase, heavy metal catalyzed oxidation
of a 2,6-dialkyl- or 2-alkyl-6-acyl-naphthalene compound using molecular
oxygen as the source of oxygen for the oxidation reaction. During this
oxidation reaction, impurities such as 2-formyl-6-naphthoic acid (FNA),
trimellitic acid (TMLA) and, when bromine oxidation promoter is used, 
various brominated compounds are produced. Although in some instances
it would be desirable to use 2,6-NDA directly for the preparation of PEN,
however, because of its high melting point (> 300Â°C with decomposition)
and extremely low solubility in ordinary solvents, 2,6-NDA is difficult to purify
to acceptable levels by standard purification techniques such as adsorption
or
