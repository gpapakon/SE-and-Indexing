<ABSTRACT>
A printing plate and a process for plate-making which 
requires no particular plate-making apparatus, wherein 

a plate-making can easily be done simply by using a safe 
aqueous solvent, are provided. 
A printing plate has a resin layer 1 soluble in an 
aqueous solvent 3 and a process for plate-making comprises 

the steps of bringing selectively an aqueous solvent (water 
sign pen 2) like water in contact with the surface of the 

resin layer 1, and removing partially or wholly the resin 
layer 1 in the contact portion by dissolving the resin 

layer in the aqueous solvent to form a engraved or 
perforated portion 5. 
 
A stencil printing plate having the above resin layer 
adhered to a porous substrate by means of an adhesive 

containing a hydrophobic polymer is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stencil printing
plate.As a conventional printing plate, a photo-sensitive or
heat-sensitive plate is known. The photo-sensitive plate is
processed for plate-making by selectively irradiating light
onto the plate to vary the physical properties of light-irradiated
portions and non-light irradiated portions and by
taking advantage of the differences in the hydrophilic and
lipophilic properties of light polymeric substances, the
solubilities of their solvents, the electrical properties of
photo-conductive substances and the adhesive strength of
light degradative substances. The heat-sensitive plate is
subjected to plate-making by selectively heating the plate
to vary the physical properties of the heated and non-heated
portions and by taking advantage of the differences in
adhesiveness of the heat-sensitive material, the differences
in the hydrophilic and lipophilic properties, and the
differences in the perforating property of the heat-sensitive
film.This process for plate-making, however, requires an
expensive plate-making apparatus hardly used in any other
process than plate-making. There is also a problem that the
process is complicated and the printing plate cannot
be made easily. Japanese patent application laid-open No. Sho 61-12387
discloses a process for plate-making by dissolving a
printing plate having a water-insoluble resin layer with a
resin-soluble solvent.Japanese patent application laid-open No. Sho 59-67051
discloses a process for plate-making by dissolving a stencil
plate in an acidic solution.DE-C-456,101 discloses a method of perforating a
stencil printing sheet composed of a highly porous substance
and a coating predetermined portions of which are removed by
subsequent treatment with a solvent. A protein,
specifically gelatine, is used as the coating of the stencil
printing sheet, and an acidic solution is used as the
solvent.However, these processes require special solutions and
exhibit problems from the standpoint of safety and
environmental pollution.As a stencil printing plate, a heat-sensitive stencil
plate has conventionally been known which is obtained by
superposing a thermoplastic resin film onto a porous
substrate and adhering the same to each other. In this
heat-sensitive stencil plate, processes for plate-making
include (1) a process for plate-making by using a heat-generating
device, such as a flash lamp or an infrared lamp,
superposing a hand-written manuscript or preliminarily-prepared
manuscript onto a heat-sensitive plate, and
