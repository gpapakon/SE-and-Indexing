<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to films or sheets 
of linear polyester having incorporated therein a 

combination of precipitated silica particles and 
calcined clay having certain particle sizes and present 

in specific amounts based upon the weight of the 
polyester film. The addition of these fillers improves 

several properties of the film, including the 
handleability while maintaining acceptable optical 

clarity and transparency and to the method of making 
such films or sheets.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polymeric film, and in
particular to a polymeric film having a combination of
fillers therein and to a method of making such film.Films or sheets of linear polyester have been
commercially available for many years. The polymeric
film has excellent draw orientation and has proved to
be especially well suited for the bi-axial film
orientation process resulting in films of outstanding
properties. Polymeric film also known as polyethylene
terephthalate or PET is strong and has excellent
inherent chemical and thermal stability properties.
The polymer preparation and film manufacturing
processes are well known to those skilled in the art
and are recited in many texts, including the
Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, second
edition, volume 12, by John Wiley and Sons, Inc., pages
1 through 313; and numerous U.S. and foreign patents.It is known that polymeric films often have poor
handling properties which may result in difficulties in
winding the films into high quality reels and
inefficient passage through processing equipment, for
example, slitting machines. Film handling properties
can be improved by increasing the surface roughness of
the film, suitably by the use of coatings, or
alternatively by incorporating fillers, i.e. organic or
inorganic particles into the film. A combination of
coatings and fillers may be used to improve film
handling properties. The problem with using coatings
to improve film handleability is that they limit the
range of uses in which the film may be employed because
of the difficulty in applying additional coating layers 
which may be required, for example, to provide antistatic,
adhesion promoting or release properties.A wide range of fillers have been incorporated
into films to improve the handling properties such as:
the glass spheres and fumed silica described in U.S.
Patents 5,132,356 and 5,137,939; and the inorganic
materials taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,274,025 which
include synthetic silica, calcium borate, calcium
carbonate, magnesium carbonate, barium sulphate,
calcium or aluminum silicate and glass spheres.
Notwithstanding the improvements these fillers provide,
the films containing such fillers are typically
restricted to particular uses.The incorporation of minute particle fillers into
films presents a number of problems particularly during
the processing of the polymer. It is typically
desirable to incorporate the fillers into the resin
system prior to the polymerization. However, this
requires subjecting the fillers to the
