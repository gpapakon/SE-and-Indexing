<ABSTRACT>
A process and an apparatus for recycling resin scrap 
including a thermosetting resin paint film and a thermoplastic 

resin substrate as its major components, wherein the resin 
scrap is supplied into a passage of a cylinder, melted, and 

delivered by delivering means from an upstream side to a 
downstream side of the passage of the cylinder, and hydrolyzed 

by a hydrolyzing agent while forming a highly packed region 
with a resistor. The resistor restricts the resin scrap to 

flow from the upstream side to the downstream side in a short 
period of time, and forms the highly packed region where a 

contact efficiency is enhanced between the resin scrap and the 
hydrolyzing agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for recycling
resin scrap and an apparatus therefor. In particular, it is
applicable to recycling resin scrap with paint film coated, for
instance, recycling vehicle bumpers.It has been required recently to recycle and re-use resin
scrap. When the resin scrap comprises thermosetting resin and
thermoplastic resin, for instance, when it comprises a
thermoplastic resin substrate and a thermosetting resin paint
film laminated on the substrate, the thermoplastic resin melts,
but the thermosetting resin does not melt nor dissolve in a
solvent. Accordingly, it is difficult to recycle such resin
scrap. This results from the fact that thermosetting resin is
cross-linked three-dimensionally therein by thermal setting.Accordingly, there has been proposed recently a recycling
process for the rein scrap which comprises a thermoplastic 
resin substrate and a thermosetting resin paint film laminated
on the substrate. In the recycling process, the resin scrap is
finely pulverized, and the finely pulverized resin scrap is
kneaded as it is with a kneader, thereby producing recycled
resin composition. However, by the recycling process, the
paint film cannot be fined, and cannot be melted in the
kneader. As a result, the paint film comes to exist as a
foreign material in the recycled resin composition. Therefore,
molded products made from the recycled resin composition comes
to exhibit degraded mechanical characteristics. The degraded
mechanical characteristics arise sharply in impact strength.
For example, when vehicle bumpers are made from the recycled
resin composition, they exhibit much more deteriorated
collision resistance in cold areas than those made from virgin
material. Hence, there arises a problem in that the recycled
resin composition can be used limitedly in minor applications
only in which impact strength is not required.Hence, the applicants of the present invention developed a
new recycling process for producing recycled resin composition
which is disclosed in Japanese Re-laid-open Patent Publication
No. 5-801,232 based upon a PCT application
(i.e. corresponding to WO-A-93/01232 and EP-A-0 547 249).
In the recycling
process, resin scrap with a thermosetting resin polyurethane
paint film or an amino resin paint film laminated is
pulverized, and the pulverized resin scrap is hydrolyzed by 
heating and melting under a pressure of
343.233 hPa [hekto Pascal] (35 kgf/cm2) at a
temperature of up to 220 °C, thereby producing recycled resin
composition. By the recycling
