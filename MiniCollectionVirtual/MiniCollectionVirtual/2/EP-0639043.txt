<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for manufacturing through-plated printed circuit boards having very small solder lands, or no solder lands. The conductor pattern structures on the board surface are becoming finer and finer as a result of the increasing wiring density. The reduction in the size of the solder lands on the through-plated holes is subject to tight limits particularly in the case of a cost-effective tenting etching method. While maintaining the photographic film coverage, tightening of the manufacturing tolerances in all the relevant process steps thus results in increased manufacturing costs. In order to avoid the manufacturing costs and the further compression of the conductor pattern structures, the invention proposes a method in which the printed circuit boards (1) are coated with etching-resistant photoresist (3) on both sides after the chemical and electrochemical formulation of the copper (2). After the photoresist (3) on the printed circuit boards (1) has dried, they are dipped into a solution by means of which an etching-resistant layer (5) is deposited on those walls of the through-plated holes (4) which remain largely free of the photoresist. After further conventional treatment of the printed circuit board, the etching-resistant layer (5) in the through-plated holes (4) is then removed by means of suitable stripping solutions.
