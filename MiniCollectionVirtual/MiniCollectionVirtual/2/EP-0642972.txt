<ABSTRACT>
A d√©railleur having at least two sprockets (A, C) on a sprocket unit (A-C) is designed in such a manner that the chain (B) can easily be shifted to and fro between a small sprocket (C) and a larger one (A). For this purpose, at least the larger sprocket (A) is constructed with a double tooth space (ZA) which forms a passage for the transfer of the chain between the two sprockets. A link-supporting ramp (16) on the larger sprocket (A) causes a chain-transfer section, which is formed in the region of the double tooth space (ZA) when the chain is being transferred from the smaller sprocket (C) to the larger sprocket (A), to have a profile (B1, B2, B3, B4, B5) which - seen in the axial direction - is convexly curved or bent radially outwards.

Derailleur gear, in particular for bicycles, comprising a driving
sprocket unit and a driven sprocket unit (A-C) as well as a chain (B)

connecting these two sprocket units together,

in which at least one (A-C) of the sprocket units is in the form of a
multi-sprocket cluster (A-C) with at least two sprockets (A, C),

namely a larger (A) and a smaller sprocket (C),

in which furthermore the two sprockets (A, C) of the multi-sprocket
cluster (A-C) each have a number of teeth (A1...;C1...) and a

corresponding number of tooth gaps (A1-A2; C1-C2) formed
between respective pairs of teeth (A1,A2; C1,C2),

in which furthermore generally speaking the tooth gaps (A1-A2; C1-C2)
are in the form of single tooth gaps for receiving respective

pivots of the chain,

in which furthermore the chain (B) is made of successive pivots
(B1...) and of pairs of inner (D2i) and outer (D3a) links in alternating

sequence between the pivots (B1...),

in which furthermore for shifting the chain over between the two
sprockets (A,C) of the multi-sprocket cluster (A-C) a shifting device

(10) is provided in an entry region (15), in which the chain (B) enters
the multi-sprocket cluster (A-C) in the normal direction of movement

(11) of the chain (B) and sprockets (A,C) and this shifting device
(10) is constructed so as to impart to the chain (B) movements in a

direction parallel to the axis (X) of the multi-sprocket cluster (A-C),

in which furthermore on shifting of the chain between the sprockets
(A,C) of the multi-
sprocket cluster (A-C) a chain transition stretch
(B1-B5) is formed between a previously occupied one (C) and a

newly occupied one (A) of the two sprockets, which stretch (B1-B5)
passes through the region of movement of the multi-sprocket cluster

(A-C) from the chain entry region (15) up to a chain departure region
(L) of the multi-sprocket cluster (A-C),
 
in which furthermore the chain transition stretch (B1-B5) extends

opposite to the normal direction of movement (11) of the multi-sprocket
cluster (A, C) from a pivot (B1) which is the last pivot (B1)

to engage between two last teeth (C1, C2) of a last tooth pair (C1,C2)
of the previously occupied sprocket (C), to a pivot (B5) which is the

first to engage between two first teeth (A4, A5) of a first tooth pair
(A4, A5) of the newly occupied sprocket (A)

and in which in at least one chain transfer circumferential region (T)
of the multi-sprocket unit (A-C) corresponding to the shift of the

chain in the shifting direction from the smaller sprocket (C) to the
larger sprocket (A) shaping measures are undertaken on the sprockets

(A, C) in order, in this chain transition circumferential region (T) to
ease the transfer of the chain (B) between the two sprockets (A, C) at

least in the shifting direction from the smaller sprocket (C) to the
larger sprocket (A) and to determine the path of the corresponding

chain transition stretch (B1-B5),
