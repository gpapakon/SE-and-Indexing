<ABSTRACT>
An optical waveguide multiplexer for use in optical 
fiber amplifiers or the like, which is simple in 

configuration, permits manufacturing at high productivity, 
and is reduced in size and moreover susceptible to little 

insertion loss, is to be realized. A multiplexer-branching 
filter is provided with first to fourth input/output (I/O) 

terminals. Part of an optical signal emitted from the 
first I/O terminal is reflected by a branching film, 

formed over one face of a glass plate, and led to the 
second optical I/O terminal. The rest of the optical 

signal penetrates the glass plate, and further penetrates 
an optical multiplexing film, formed on the other face, 

to be led to the third optical I/O terminal. The invention 
has a particular characteristic that the thickness t of 

the substrate is set so as to satisfy the condition of 
t ≧ w/cosϑ x tan[sin⁻¹{(sinϑ)/n}]
 where n is the refractive 
index of the substrate; w, the beam diameter of the output 

light of the optical I/O terminal for multiplexing the 
signal light with an pomping light; and ϑ, the angle of 

incidence from this terminal to the substrate. By setting 
the substrate thickness at or above the value stated above, 

the optical path of any leak light from the pomping light 
side is deviated from that toward the monitor side, and 

no pumping light can enter into the monitor. It is also  
 

possible, by adding an aperture film to the substrate, 
to further reduce the leak light.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the configuration of
an optical wavelength multiplexer for use in optical fiber
amplifiers and the like.In an optical communication system for long-distance
transmission, feeble optical signals attenuated on the
transmission path have to be amplified in optical repeaters
and receivers arranged on the path. Recently, as means
for such amplification, optical fiber amplifiers for
directly amplifying optical signals without having to
converting them into electric signals are coming into
practical use.A typical configuration of such an optical amplifier
is illustrated in FIG. 1. An optical fiber amplifier 11
comprises optical isolators 16 and 18, optical branching
filters 13 and 19, an optical wavelength multiplexer 15,
pumping light source 26, a rare earth ion-doped optical
fiber 17 for performing optical amplification, and monitor
photodiodes (monitor PD's) 22 and 25. Part of a signal
light P1 of wavelength λ1, attenuated on the transmission
path, is branched into a light P2 by the optical branching
filter 13 as monitor light, and entered into the monitor
PD 22. The remaining light is transmitted to the optical 
wavelength multiplexer 15, and multiplexed with a pumping
light P3 of wavelength λ2, which is supplied from the
pumping light source 26, to output a light P4. The light
P4 further passes the isolator 16 and is transmitted over
the rare earth ion-doped optical fiber 17 for the amplifying
purpose. In this while, the original signal light P1 is
optically amplified into a light P5 to pass the isolator 18.
At this time, part of the light P5 is branched by the
optical branching filter 19 into a light P6 as monitor
light to be entered into the monitor PD 25, and the
remaining light P7 is supplied from the optical fiber
amplifier 11. Here, the wavelength λ1 of the normally
transmitted signal light differs from the wavelength λ2
of the pumping light. For instance, against a signal
light of λ1 = 1.55 µm, at which the transmission loss
of the optical fiber is minimized, a pumping light of
λ2 = 1.48 µm or 0.98 µm, at which the rare earth ion-doped
optical fiber can achieve a large amplification
gain, is used.Any optical fiber amplifier according to the prior
art has a configuration in which the optical branching
filter for branching part of the entered signal light to
a monitor PD and the optical wavelength multiplexer for
multiplexing the pumping light from an excited light
source are separately provided. Regarding the case in
which the optical branching filter and the optical
