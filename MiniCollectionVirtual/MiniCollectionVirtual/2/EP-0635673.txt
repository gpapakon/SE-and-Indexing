<ABSTRACT>
An energy recovery, pressure reducing system (30 or 50) 
for reducing high pressure gas in a transmission pipeline 

(13A) to a lower pressure in a consumer pipeline (18A) 
includes a primary pressure regulator or regulating valve 

(17A or 17B) having an adjustable flow control opening, the 
pressure regulating valve (17A or 17B) being selectively 

connectable between the transmission and consumer pipelines 
(13A and 18A) for throttling the high pressure gas and 

producing low pressure gas when the primary pressure 
regulator or regulating valve (17A or 17B) connects the 

pipelines. A bypass line (45 or 51) shunts the primary 
pressure regulator or regulating valve for connecting the 

pipelines when the primary pressure regulating valve is 
disconnected from the pipelines. The bypass line includes 

an expander system having at least one expander (31, 101, or 
EXP) for expanding the high pressure gas in the gas 

transmission pipeline (13A) and producing work and lower 
pressure gas that is supplied to the consumer pipeline 

(18A). Preferably, a generator (33 or G) is coupled to the 
expander (31, 101, or EXP) for converting work produced by 

the expander (31, 101, or EXP) to electricity which is 
supplied to an electrical load. A fast acting, selectively 

adjustable pressure regulator or regulating valve apparatus 
(41 or 17B) is connected in parallel with the expander 

system. Finally, a control system (47 or 58) is provided, 
responsive to a reduction in flow through the expander 

system for rapidly switching the apparatus from a non-operational 
state in which no gas is transmitted between the 

transmission and the consumer pipelines (13A and 18A), to an 
operational state in which high pressure gas is throttled to 

the lower pressure in the consumer pipeline (18A) and 
transmitted thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an energy recovery, pressure 
reducing system, and apparatus therefor, as well as to a 
method for using the same. Natural gas and other gases, such as combustible gases, 
are routinely transported to users via high pressure 
pipelines. Conventionally, natural gas extracted from a 
production well in one part of the country is first locally 
conditioned and then supplied to a high pressure gas 
transmission pipeline for long distance transfer to users 
sometimes thousands of miles away. Because of the 
frictional losses in the pipeline, compressor stations are 
regularly located along the length of the pipeline to 
maintain the high pressure therein. Near a user location, it is conventional to provide a 
metering and regulating station whose function is to reduce 
the gas pressure to a level consistent with local 
transmission to one or more users such as industrial 
customers, electrical utilities, domestic customers, etc. A 
typical metering and regulating station would include a 
pressure regulating system including one or more pressure 
regulators or regulating valves each of which includes a 
regulated flow control opening established by a variable 
orifice or movable diaphragm that throttles the gas for 
reducing its pressure to a level compatible with local 
distribution and/or use. Conventional pressure regulators 
or regulating flow control valves are usually pneumatically 
operated by a downstream sensor so as to maintain a 
preselected range of downstream pressures in the face of 
changes in local demand, etc., and also usually in face of 
changes in upstream pressure. Throttling of a high pressure gas wastes the energy  
 
expended in the process of reducing the gas pressure; and 
one solution to recovering some of this energy is to expand 
the gas in an expander. In such case, the high pressure gas 
expands in a rotary machine such as a radial flow expander 
coupled to a generator, and the pressure reduction in the 
expander is converted to electricity. Thus, the 
expander/generator constitutes an energy recovery, pressure 
reducer that duplicates the function of a conventional 
pressure regulating valve in a pressure reducing station. 
In this manner, some of the energy expended to pressurize 
the gas is recovered. Because a temperature drop accompanies the pressure 
drop through the expander, any moisture in the gas is likely 
to freeze detrimentally affecting the operation of the 
expander and utilization devices downstream of the expander.
