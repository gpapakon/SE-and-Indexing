<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a film storing sheet. More
particularly, it relates to a film storing sheet wherein users can
know contents of images at first sight and easily distinguish
specific image when users wish to make extra prints.Conventionally, a developed film is divided into some pieces and
stored in a semi-transparent film sheet (hereinafter referred to film
sheet). Users can know contents of the film stored in the film sheet
by checking prints, to which the film is printed, one by one, or by
holding the film directly to the light.However, light intensity and hue of the developed film is reverse of
those of the printed photographic paper so that users cannot easily
know images of negatives, especially for colour photograph. When
users wish to make extra prints, therefore, it takes much time for
them to know the specific image and is difficult to distinguish the
specific image among the other images if images similar to the
specific image exist in the film. Consequently, wrong film numbers
might be selected for extra prints.Also, when developed film and prints are stored separately, there
might arise a problem that specific prints are found but the
corresponding film is lost.The prior art of WO 91/20017, which is the starting point of the
present invention, discloses a photographic image set including an
index print integrally stored with the associated negative strips.
The photographic image set provides a single storage and retrieval
system which offers the possibility to store the negatives safely and
at the same time to index the negatives by showing the positive image
of each negative at corresponding positions.Further the US-A- 4 966 285 discloses a sheet with an index printed
on one side of the sheet showing small-sized positive images in a
certain order. On the other side of the sheet there are different 
transparent sheets attached to the sheet which are sized to build
bags for filing all negatives of the film in one bag and printed
photographs as a stack in one or two other bags.In view of the above circumstances, it is an object of the present
invention to provide a film storing sheet wherein the user can easily
distinguish the specific film number for ordering new extra prints
and wherein the film storing sheet also enables the user to store the
printed photographs in a convenient way.In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a film
storing sheet comprising: an index print on which recorded images on
a developed film are printed, and a film sheet provided at
