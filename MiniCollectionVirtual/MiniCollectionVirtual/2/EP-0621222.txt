<ABSTRACT>
A relief device for the tamping mechanism (176) of an offset sheet set stacker. A 
sheet set stacker is provided having a plurality of retractable tamping mechanisms for 

alternately offsetting sheet sets within the stacker. Each tamping mechanism (176) is provided 
with a spring biased follower arm (206) which locks the tamping mechanism (176) in an 

operative position. A relief device in the form of an oblong pivot mount allows the tamping 
mechanism (176) to not only pivotally retract from an operative position but to also shift a 

slight amount transversely to the paper path process direction. This slight shift prevents a 
binding of the tamper against the just compiled sheet stack (214) and minimizes the occurrence 

of sheet stack disturbance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an apparatus for offset stacking of sheet sets. US-A-5,188,353 
which represents the closest prior art 
discloses a disk stacker having a tampering mechanism located over a 
sheet-receiving platform 
according to the features in the preamble of claim 1. 
First and second registration walls are provided, each wall having a 
tamper located adjacent to the wall and movable through an aperture therein. The tamper has 
an active position and inactive position and the tamper on each side registration wall operate 
alternately to offset stacks from one side to the other as each sheet set is discharged to the 
stacker. The present invention has as a main object the provision of means for preventing the 
jamming of the tamping mechanism of the stacking apparatus and disturbance of the stacked 
sheet sets.  
 Accordingly, the present invention provides an apparatus in accoordance with 
appended claims 1 to 8. Also provided is an electrophotographic printing machine in 
accordance with appended claim 9. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an 
apparatus for preventing sheet stack disturbance in a sheet stacker. The apparatus comprises a 
first registration member defining an aperture therein and a second registration member 
opposed from the first the registration member. There is also provided a first tamping 
mechanism located adjacent the first registration member, adapted to be movable through the 
aperture defined in the first registration member, the first tamping mechanism being movable 
between an inactive position located within the first registration member and an active 
position extending beyond the first registration member, the first tamping mechanism being 
adapted to oscillate, in the active position to tamp incoming sheets against the second 
registration member. There is also 
provided in a characterizing aspect a 
first means for relieving a force exerted on the first tamping 
mechanism by a sheet stack formed within the sheet stacker. Pursuant to another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an 
electrophotographic printing machine of the type having a stacking device in which sets of 
sheets are stacked alternately offset from one another in a cross process direction, the stacking 
device having an apparatus to prevent sheet stack disturbance. The present invention will be described further, by way of example, with reference to 
the accompanying drawings, in which:-
