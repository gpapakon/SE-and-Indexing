<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a medicament for 
treating human immunodeficiency virus. Recently, studies for providing medicaments for treating 
various virus diseases have been earnestly made. Particularly, 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) constitutes 
a serious social problem. It is known that AIDS 
is caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV). At present, 3'-deoxy-3'-azidothymidine (AZT) is 
approved as a medicament for treating the HIV infectious 
disease. However, this medicament has a problem that it 
shows high toxicity to host cells so as to cause troublesome 
side effect. Therefore, development of compounds 
showing high antiviral activity to HIV but low toxicity to 
host cells has been desired. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
medicament showing high antiviral activity to human immunodeficiency 
virus which utilizes a new nucleoside derivative. The present invention resides in a medicament for 
treating human immunodeficiency virus which contains, an 
active component, a nucleoside derivative having the 
formula (1-1) or (1-2):     wherein A is a nitrogen atom-containing heterocyclic 
ring which is linked through nitrogen atom thereof; B is a 
hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an azido group, an alkyl 
group having 1-7 carbon atoms, an aralkyl group having 5-19 
carbon atoms, an alkoxyalkyl group having 2-15 carbon 
atoms, an alkoxy group having 1-7 carbon atom, a haloalkoxy 
group having 1-7 carbon atoms, an aralkyloxy group having 
5-19 carbon atoms, an aryloxy group having 4-10 carbon 
atoms, a cycloalkyloxy group having 3-7 carbon atoms, or a 
cycloalkyloxy group having 4-6 carbon atoms and one or two 
heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of oxygen, 
nitrogen and sulfur; each of R¹ and R⁴ independently is a 
hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1-7 carbon atoms, a 
cycloalkyl group having 3-7 carbon atoms, an aralkyl group 
having 5-19 carbon atoms, or an aryl group having 4-10 carbon 
atoms, in which each of the aralkyl group and aryl 
group may have one or more substituents selected from the 
group consisting of a halogen atom, an alkyl group having 
1-7 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 1-7 carbon atoms, 
a haloalkyl group having 1-7 carbon atoms, an alkoxyalkyl 
group having 2-15 carbon atoms and a haloalkoxy group having  
 
1-7 carbon atoms; each of R², R³, R⁵ and R⁶ independently 
is a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a hydroxyl 
group, an alkyl group having 1-7 carbon atoms, an alkoxy 
group having 1-7 carbon atoms, a
