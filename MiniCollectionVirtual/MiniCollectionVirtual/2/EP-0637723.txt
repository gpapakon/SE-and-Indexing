<CLAIMS>
Exchanger device for heating a viscous agrifoodstuff
fluid by passing it through a length that is

produced as an annulus, comprising:

an internal pipe (1);
an external pipe (2) surrounding the internal
pipe (1);
holding means between the two, internal (1)
and external (2), pipes, the fluid having to flow

between the two, internal (1) and external (2), pipes;
and
means of electrically heating the two,
internal (1) and external (2), pipes,

characterized in that the heating means consists in
applying power in parallel to the two, internal (1) and

external (2), pipes, which are then mounted electrically
in parallel, the holding means allowing the electrical

current to pass from the external pipe into the internal
pipe.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the holding means are fins (5) fixed longitudinally

between the two, internal (1) and external (2), pipes.
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the fins (5) are used in groups of three, spaced

angularly at 120Â°. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the fins (5) have an electrical resistance very

much lower than that of the internal pipe (1).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that it comprises several lengths (10), each made up of

an internal pipe (1) and an external pipe (2), with an
electrical connecting piece (7) placed at each end (10A,

10B) of each length at right angles to the external
surface of the external pipe (2).
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in
that it comprises, for each connecting piece (7), a

sleeve (8) for supporting these connecting pieces (7)
and preventing localized overheating of the external

pipe (2).
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in
that it comprises several lengths (10) mounted in

parallel.
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in
that it comprises several lengths (10) mounted in

series, each length being connected to another by an
elbow (11).
