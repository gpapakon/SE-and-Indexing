<ABSTRACT>
Glazing (1), intended to be fixed into the opening of bodywork by bonding, is equipped with a profiled frame (8) extruded directly onto an opaque layer (5) of the glazing (1) before polymerisation. The profiled frame (8) is equipped at its periphery with a lip (10) overhanging the edge (3) of the glazing (1). The lip (10), once the glazing (1) has been fitted, bears against the metal sheet (4) facing the edge (3) of the glazing (1). This lip (10) serves as a centring and protective element for the glazing while the adhesive (13) is setting (curing). The profiled frame (8) is laterally bounded to allow direct contact between the bead of adhesive (13) and the opaque layer (5).

<CLAIMS>
Pane (1), especially automobile pane intended to be glued
directly into the frame of the opening of a window, the

pane being equipped with a profiled frame (8) deposited
on an opaque film (5) of the surface of the glass

opposite the metal sheeting, which frame will serve, by
means of an appendage, as a protective and centering

element during the setting of the adhesive fixing the
panel (1), said appendage of the profiled frame (8) being

a lip (10) which projects beyond the pane (1)
substantially parallel to the surface of the glass and

which, while the pane is being positioned, bears against
the metal sheeting of the window opening parallel to the

edge face of the pane, characterized in that the profiled
frame is limited laterally to permit a direct contact

between the cord of adhesive (13) and the opaque film
(5).
Pane according to claim 1, characterized in that a second
part (9) is adjoined to the profiled frame (8), this

second part having the function of limiting the expansion
of the adhesive (13).
Pane according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
lip (10) which projects beyond the edge face (3) of the

pane (1) has a length (L) of between approximately 5 and
10 mm.
Pane according to one of claims 1, 2 or 3, characterized
in that the profiled frame (8), including its protective

and centering lip (10), is constituted of an elastomer.
Pane according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that a film of primer (6) has been

deposited on the opaque film (5).
