<ABSTRACT>
A cutting head stabilizer (25a,25b) for controlling the movement 
of the substantially U-shaped cutting blade (5) of a tire groover. 

The stabilizer facilitates the rapid and precise movement of the 
substantially U-shaped cutting blade (5) about the gripping surface 

of a tire.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application is a continuation-in-part of 
U.S. Patent Application No. 07/812,103, filed December 23, 1991. The present invention relates generally to the cutting 
or grooving of rubber or other heat sensitive materials. The 
present invention more particularly relates to the grooving of 
rubber tires used on various vehicles, including trucks and other 
motor vehicles and to a cutting head member for a resistance-heated 
tire groover. The present invention also relates to a 
resistance-heated tire groover that incorporates a cutting head 
member and facilitates the grooving of rubber tires in a rapid, 
efficient, and precise manner. It has long been known that tires for various vehicles, 
although worn smooth as a result of extended operation on abrasive 
road surfaces, nonetheless retain significant amounts of 
rubber on their circumferential surfaces so that new tread 
patterns may be cut or "grooved" into such surfaces, thereby 
allowing the tires to be returned to service and their operable 
lives extended for thousands of additional miles. Grooving of  
 
tires has been particularly prevalent in the trucking industry, 
where tractor/trailer vehicles can have up to 18 large tires, 
each of which costs several hundred dollars when purchased new. 
Obviously, a grooving technique that allows such tires to be 
rejuvenated so that their operable lives are significantly 
extended has found great favor with tractor/trailer owners and 
operators. Previous tire groovers most often have operated by 
means of a heated cutting blade that slices through the rubber 
material on the circumferential surface of the tire being 
grooved. Such known tire groovers are discussed and referenced 
in U.S. Patent No. 4,797,999, to Van Alstine, which is hereby 
incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. Known tire 
groovers have typically employed a sliding block or similar 
surface positioned completely behind or between the legs of a U-shaped 
cutting blade for guiding or steadying the tire groover 
along the circumference of the tire during grooving operations. 
In such tire groovers, a sliding block or surface is always 
placed either rearward of the cutting edge of the blade or 
between the legs of the U-shaped blade, so that the sliding block 
or surface typically rides above a freshly cut portion of tire 
material which is squeezed or pinched between the blade legs and 
sliding block during tire grooving operations. It is difficult to accurately control the movement of 
known tire groovers, because

An apparatus for cutting a tire groove in the road 
gripping surface of a tire comprising: stabilizer means for 

guiding a cutting head member in a cutting direction at a 
substantially constant angle along said road gripping surface 

of said tire, said stabilizer means having a forward edge and 
a rearward edge, said cutting head member having a cutting 

edge for cutting through said tire in said cutting direction, 
said forward edge being positioned in front of a reference 

line normal to said cutting direction passing through said 
cutting edge, said rearward edge being positioned substantially 

even with said reference line. 
An apparatus for cutting a tire groove in the road 
gripping surface of a tire comprising: stabilizer means for 

guiding a cutting head member in a cutting direction at a 
substantially constant angle along said road gripping surface 

of said tire, said stabilizer means having a forward edge and 
a rearward edge, said cutting head member having a cutting 

edge for cutting through said tire in said cutting direction, 
said forward edge and said rearward edge being positioned in 

front of a reference line normal to said cutting direction 
passing through said cutting edge. 
An apparatus for cutting a tire groove in the road 
gripping surface of a tire comprising: stabilizer means for 

guiding a cutting head member in a cutting direction at a 
substantially constant angle along said road gripping surface 

of said tire, said stabilizer means having a forward edge and 
a rearward edge, said cutting head member having a cutting 

edge for cutting through said tire in said cutting direction, 
said forward edge being positioned in front of a reference 

line normal to said cutting direction passing through said 
cutting edge, said rearward edge being positioned behind said 

 
reference line, wherein the distance between said forward 

edge and said reference line is greater than or equal to the 
distance between said rearward edge and said reference line. 
The apparatus of claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said 
cutting edge is biased downward to drive said cutting edge 

into said tire during grooving operations. 
The apparatus of claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said 
cutting edge is biased to drive said cutting edge at an angle 

substantially parallel to said road gripping surface during 
grooving operations. 
The apparatus of claim 4, wherein said stabilizer 
means has sliding means for reducing the friction between 

said tire and said stabilizer means during grooving operations. 
The apparatus of claim 6, wherein said stabilizer 
means is comprised of first and second stabilizing members, 

said first and second stabilizing members being rigidly 
attached to said cutting head member. 
The apparatus of claim 7, wherein said first and 
second stabilizer members are L shaped, said first and second 

stabilizer members each having a leg positioned directly in 
front of said cutting edge along said cutting direction.
