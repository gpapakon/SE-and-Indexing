<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to combustible case elements (24) for artillery ammunition. The said elements, obtained by felting, compacting and baking, have a plane part of revolution (2, 7), an outer wall (5, 10) and an inner neck (4, 9) in one piece. Two complementary elements thus make it possible to obtain combustible cases which are easy to load with loose powder (25) and which do not present any problem in the positioning of the central channel, since the latter consists of the inner necks (4, 9). A complementary combustible ignition tube (26) consisting of agglomerated powder is advantageously positioned within the central channel thus defined. The invention also relates to a method for obtaining these elements by the use of a specially designed felting mould.

<CLAIMS>
Combustible container component (1) comprising a
hollow central channel, for artillery ammunition, obtained

by felting on a mould which is permeable to fluids, of an
aqueous suspension consisting mainly of nitrocellulose

fibres, cellulose fibres and a resin, such as to obtain a
blank for the said component which is t
hen compacted and
baked, characterised in that the said component (1) has at

least one substantially flat revolution part (2) which has
a circular central aperture (3) edged by a hollow

cylindrical central neck (4), and in that the said blank is
felted in a single operation.
Combustible container component according to claim 1,
characterised in that the said flat revolution part (2) is

edged by a cylindrical outer wall (5) which is disposed on
the same side as the said central neck (4).
Combustible container component according to claim 2,
characterised in that the said outer wall (5) has a height

which is substantially the same as the height of the said
central neck (4).
Combustible container component according to claim 2,
characterised in that the said outer wall (21) has a height

which is different from the height of the said central neck
(20).
Use of components according to any one of claims 1 to
4 in a method for producing filled combustible containers

for artillery ammunition, characterised in that:

1) two complementary components (1,6) of combustible
containers are produced by felting, compacting and

baking;
2) one of the said components (1) is filled with a
propellant powder; 
3) the component thus filled is rendered integral
with the second component, such as to constitute a

combustible container (24) which is filled with powder
and has a central channel.
Use according to claim 5, characterised in that an
ignition tube (26) is inserted in the said central channel.
Use according to claim 6, characterised in that the
said ignition tube (26) is obtained by bonding grains of

propellant powder which are coated with a binder based on
polyvinyl nitrate.
Method of production by felting of a blank (55), from
components according to any one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that there is immersed in the said
suspension a mould (28) which has a revolution cavity

consisting of an envelope (52), and a base (41) which has a
flat surface and a central column (42, 43), the said base

and the said column being permeable at least to fluids, and
being maintained spaced from the inner walls of the mould

such as to form at least one empty space (44), and in that
suction is applied to the interior of the empty space (44).
Method according to claim 8, characterised in that the
said outer envelope (52) is at least partially permeable to

fluids, and delimits an empty space (53) in which a vacuum
can be created.
