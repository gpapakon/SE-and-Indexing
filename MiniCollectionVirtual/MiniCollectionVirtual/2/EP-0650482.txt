<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to substituted pyrimidine
compounds, their preparation and use as pesticides.Dutch Patent Specification No. 6814057 discloses a wide range
of substituted pyrimidines and their use as fungicides.J. Indian Chem. Soc., 52(8), 1975, 774-775, and 53(9), 1976,
913-914 discloses a number of 2-amino-4,6-bis aryloxy and arylimino
pyrimidines and suggests that they may have useful biological
properties.It has now been found that a group of substituted pyrimidines
generically described in NL-6814057 but not specifically disclosed
therein have acaricidal activity which is significantly greater
than that of 2-amino-substituted analogues.The present invention provides a compound of the general
formula

in which
X1 and X2are the same and each represents an oxygen atom; a group
S(O)n in which n is 0, 1 or 2; or a group CO, CH2 or NR
in which R represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-12 alkyl group;R1 and R10are the same or different and each represents a hydrogen
atom or a halogen atom;R2 and R9are the same or different and each represents a hydrogen 
atom, a halogen atom or a cyano, nitro, C1-12 alkyl,
haloC1-6alkyl, C1-6alkoxy, C1-6alkylthio, amino, mono- or
di-C1-6alkylamino, C1-6alkoxyC1-6alkyl, haloC1-6alkoxyC1-6alkyl
or C1-6alkoxycarbonyl group;R3 and R8are the same or different and each represents a
hydrogen atom, a fluorine or chlorine atom, or a
C1-12 alkyl, haloC1-6alkyl, haloC1-6alkoxy,
haloC1-6alkylthio, haloC2-4alkenyl,
haloC1-6alkoxyC1-6alkyl, C1-6alkoxycarbonyl,
haloC1-6alkylsulphinyl, haloC1-6alkylsulphonyl, nitro or
cyano group;R4 and R7are the same or different and each represents a
hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or a C1-12 alkyl or
C1-6 alkoxy group;R5represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, or a cyano,
C1-12alkyl, haloC1-6alkyl, C1-6alkoxy, C1-6alkylthio,
C1-6alkylsulphinyl or phenyl group;
and
R6represents a hydrogen atom or, when R5 is hydrogen, a
C1-12alkyl group;
provided that either each of the two phenyl rings is unsubstituted
or at least one of R3 and R8 is other than hydrogen.To maintain activity the phenyl rings of formula I must be
either unsubstituted or at least one must be 3-substituted.An alkyl group, unless otherwise specified, is suitably a
straight chain or branched chain group containing up to 12 carbon
atoms, for example up to 8 carbon atoms. Preferably an alkyl group
contains up to 6 carbon atoms. Especially preferred alkyl groups
are methyl, ethyl and butyl. Any alkyl moiety which forms part of
another group, for example the alkyl of a haloalkyl group
