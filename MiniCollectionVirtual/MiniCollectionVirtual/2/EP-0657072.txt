<ABSTRACT>
A digital-to-analog converter (DAC, 300) utilizes a coarse DAC (306) and fine DAC (315) to produce an analog output signal having both low glitch energy and good linearity performance. The DAC (300) also uses an error table (312) to store correction data generated through a calibration procedure. Outputs (307, 311) from each DAC (306, 315) are summed to produce an analog output signal which exhibits better linearity than does the output (307) of the coarse DAC (306) alone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to communication devices and more
particularly to the implementation of digital-to-analog converters (DACs) in
communication devices.Digital-to-analog converters (DACs) are frequently used in the design
of communication devices. By their design, however, DACs have inherent
problems such as excess glitch energy upon a change in input voltage, settling
problems immediately after the change in input voltage, and linearity
problems related to the accuracy of an output voltage for a given input word.
Each of these problems has its own effects on the performance of the
communication device, specifically the spurious responses and
intermodulation (IM) of signals resulting from the communication devices.DACs are typically characterized by the number of bits that can be
accepted at their input. Obviously, lower bit DACs (for example, 3-8 bit
DACs) offer poor resolution, which consequently causes more distortion in
the communication device. On the other hand, lower bit DACs are generally
very fast and may exhibit fewer problems with respect to excess glitch energy
and settling time. Higher bit DACs (10 to 16 bit DACs) offer better resolution
(i.e., linearity performance) but are usually slow and may seriously suffer
from the excess glitch energy/settling time problem.United States Patent US-A-4,963,870 proposes a digital/analog
converting device for converting upper M bits of an input digital signal into a
first analog signal; a memory for receiving, as address data, at least a digital 
signal of lower N bits of the input digital signal to output lower-bit-output-approximate
data of S (S>N) bits in response to the address data; a second
digital/analog converter for converting digital data at least including the S-bit
lower-bit-output-approximate data into a second analog signal; and an
analog adder for outputting an added analog signal obtained by adding the
first and second analog signals at a predetermined ratio.Consequently, when communication devices which are highly 
susceptible to the above-mentioned problems are designed, a
severe compromise in the choice of DAC, and thus
communication device performance, must be made.Therefore, a need exists for a DAC which exhibits good
excess glitch energy and settling performance while also exhibiting
good linearity.FIG. 1 generally depicts curves of an analog output of both
ideal and actual DACs versus digital input words.FIG. 2 generally depicts excess glitch energy, settling and
linearity problems of actual DACs at the time shortly
