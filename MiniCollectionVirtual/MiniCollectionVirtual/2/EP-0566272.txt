<ABSTRACT>
A condensation-curing type curable composition which comprises 
a diorganopolysiloxane or polyoxyalkylene blocked 

by hydrolyzable silyl group at both terminal ends of its 
molecular chain as a base polymer, in which a carbonyl 

group-containing organic compound and an amino group-containing 
organic compound are compounded. This composition 

is capable of forming water through dehydration condensation 
between carbonyl and amino groups, simultaneously 

with curing of the composition by moisture in air. The 
formation of water offers marked improvements in fast-curing 

property and also in depth curing property.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a room temperature 
fast-curing composition, and more particularly to a 
condensation-curing type room temperature fast-curing composition 
which has good fast-curing property and depth 
curing property (i.e., property for curing to deep, or inside, 
portions thereof). As a condensation-curing type room temperature 
fast-curing composition, there have been known those of 
one-pack type in which the amount of crosslinking agent is 
reduced to an utmost degree so as to enhance curing rate 
and those of two-pack type in which a crosslinking agent 
and a curing agent are enclosed in separate packs. However, the one-pack type compositions have only 
the advantage of high rate of cure from the surface thereof, 
and they need a certain period of time for curing to 
their deep portions. Thus, such compositions cannot be 
said really "fast-curing". The two-pack type compositions are comparatively 
better in depth curing properties. However, the two-pack 
type compositions are bothersome to deal with, and are not 
well suited to use with mixing machines or the like, because  
 
the two parts in separate packs are not formulated for 
a mixing ratio of 1:1. Furthermore, for complete cure to 
the depth, it is necessary to specify strictly the addition 
amounts of crosslinking agent and curing agent or to add 
water as a depth curing agent. On the other hand, addition-curable organopolysiloxane 
compositions of two-pack type are superior in workability, 
because the two parts in separate packs are formulated for 
a 1:1 mixing ratio. However, this type of compositions 
usually require a heating furnace for curing. Besides, they 
have limitations as to working atmospheres because a curing 
catalyst used therein is poisoned in the present of a 
substance poisonous to the catalyst or to the addition 
reaction. Specification US-A-4 220 748 discloses a one pack type 
room temperature curable polyorganosiloxane composition 
which releases acetic acid during curing and contains a 
reaction product of an aminosilane and a polycarboxylic acid 
anhydride in order to improve adhesion of the composition. 
Specification DE-A-36 07 071 describes an adhesion-enhancing 
agent which consists of the reaction product of an amino-compound 
with a primary and/or secondary amino group in its 
molecule, or an amino-compound modified with an epoxy-compound, 
and a diketone. Specification EP-A-0 208 963 
describes a fast-curing silicone paste which is a mixture of 
polydimethylsiloxanes, an oxiaminosilane, a
