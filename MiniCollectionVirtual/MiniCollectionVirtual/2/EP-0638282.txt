<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus comprises a separable sensor (1) for 
detecting physiological data of a human body, a memory 

(4) for storing the physiological data such as brain 
waves, skin temperature, and the like detected, a 

controller (3) for reading out the physiological data 
from the memory and for supplying to a light modulator 

(5), and an LED (5a) for emitting a flickering light or 
a sound converted in accordance with the physiological 

data toward the user. The physiological data upon 
leading has been stored in the memory. Therefore, when 

the same user is intended to lead into the same desired 
state again, the physiological and mental state of the 

user which has detected before may be used. There is, 
consequently, no need to attach a sensor each time of 

the leading.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus
for supplying a leading signal to a human body to lead
physiological and mental states of a human being to a
desired state, in particular an apparatus for
leading brain waves by using a pull-in phenomenon of
brain waves or the like.For example, it is known that there is an intimate
relation between the human brain waves and the
physiological and mental states. For example, when the
human being is in a relax state, many α waves (about 8 to
13 Hz) are included in the human brain waves. When the
human being is in an active state, many β waves (about 13
to 30 Hz) are included. When the human being feels
sleepiness or the like, many  waves (about 4 to 8 Hz)
are included. Since a pull-in phenomenon in which
human brain waves are tuned with stimuli from the outside
occurs in the human brain, by
tuning the brain waves with stimuli to the human being so
as to induce many brain waves in a predetermined
frequency band, the human physiological and mental states
can be led to a desired state. For example, Japanese Patent Application No. 63-323698
discloses a brain wave leading apparatus in which
an interaction between the human brain waves and the
physiological and mental states is used, and by inducing
the α waves with stimuli to the body, the human being is
led into a relax state, thereby reducing stresses or
realizing mental concentration.In the above brain wave leading apparatus, a sensor
to detect the brain waves of a subject, an organism
amplifier, a band pass filter, and a light stimulus
apparatuses such as an LED for emitting a optical signal
or the like are sequentially connected. Furthermore, by
fetching the subject into a closed loop, a kind of
oscillating circuit is constructed. In an apparatus, the
brain waves of the subject are detected, then a band pass
filter transmits only the frequency component
corresponding to the brain wave to be induced in the
detected brain waves. The LED converts the filtered
frequency component into the optical signal. The optical
signal is, further, fed back as a body stimulus signal to
the subject, so that only the signal component
corresponding to the predetermined brain wave is
circulated in the oscillating circuit. In this manner,
the brain waves are led to a desired state by the pull-in
phenomenon of the circulating signal.In the brain wave leading apparatus with the above 
construction, however, when the brain waves are intended
to lead, it is necessary to measure the brain waves of
the subject, so that the sensor for detection
