<ABSTRACT>
A carrier for an automatic transmission of a motor 
vehicle is provided. The carrier (10) comprises a hub (12), 

an annular face plate (14), a plurality of posts (18), and a 
plurality of planetary gears (16). The hub (12) includes a 

collar (22) having internal teeth (24) adapted to mesh with 
an input or an output shaft, and a disc (20) attached to 

the collar. The posts (18) are generally cylindrical, and 
extend between the hub (12) and the face plate (14) 

substantially within the respective perimeters of the hub 
and the face plate. The planetary gears (16) are disposed 

in a gear pocket between the hub (12) and the face 
plate (14), with each planetary gear (16) being mounted on 

an associated pinion shaft and adapted to mesh with both a 
sun gear and a ring gear. A method of making a carrier for 

an automatic transmission is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to carriers for automatic
transmissions, and more particularly to such a carrier which
has a series of structural support posts capacity discharge
welded in place to join a hub and a face plate.Automatic transmissions for motor vehicles commonly use
torque-converter couplings with planetary gear units that
can supply one or two gear reductions and reverse, depending
on the design, by simultaneously engaging or locking various
elements of the planetary gear unit. Typically, a simple
planetary gear unit includes a sun gear, a ring gear, and a
carrier which supports a plurality of shafts on which are
mounted planet or pinion gears. The planetary gearset
carrier provides the structure to carry torque through the
pinion gears and shafts to an output member, and therefore
must be rigid enough to provide gear location without
deflection.Conventional planet carriers are known which are either
one piece castings, castings fastened together such as by
riveting, or steel multi-piece constructions joined together
by laser welding or electron beam welding. For example, the
A4LD carrier used by Ford Motor Company, the assignee of the
present invention, utilises a stamped plate having a bent
leg which is capacity discharge welded onto radial
projections in a hub portion of the carrier.Swiss Patent CH 0 415 215 describes in accordance with the features of the preamble of claim 1 a planet carrier
comprising a body portion and a ring member. A plurality of
bosses are integrally formed on a flange portion of the body
portion and these bosses are attached to the ring member by
riveting to provide a gear pocket between the body portion
and the ring member. French Patent FR 2 299 566 describes a
planet wheel carrier having two sheet metal parts in which
one sheet metal part is provided with bent webs which engage
in and are welded in arcuate slots in the other part.According to the present invention we provide a carrier
for an automatic transmission, the carrier comprising: a hub 
and a face plate which are spaced apart but attached
together to provide a gear pocket therebetween; and a
plurality of planetary gears disposed in the gear pocket and
adapted to mesh with both a sun gear and a ring gear;
characterised in that a plurality of hollow posts extend
between, and are welded to, the hub and the face plate. A carrier embodying the invention has an effective
multiple piece construction which is very strong, and is
easy to manufacture at a relatively low cost.Further a carrier allows flexibility of
