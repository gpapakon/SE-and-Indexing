<ABSTRACT>
A method for random access in a time divided mobile radio system, for instance an FDMA/TDMA system, which includes digital traffic channels and control channels which are organized so that four traffic channels (TC) and two control channels (CC) are included in a TDMA-frame. A base station (BS) transmits continuously flags (B/I, R/N, R/F) in the time slots (1, 4) of the control channels. A mobile station desiring access to the system responds by sending a first message word (W1) in the time slot indicated by the base station in a first flag (B/I). When the mobile station (MS1) wishes to transmit several message words (W2, W3), the base station (BS) reserves one or more time slots to this end by transmitting the first flag (B/I), although this flag now states that these time slots are busy for other mobile stations (MS2, MS3). Furthermore, the base station transmits a flag (R/N) which states whether or not a message word has been received from the mobile station (MS1). The base station can transmit a further flag (R/F), which denotes that a given time slot has been reserved for a given mobile station (MS3) from the very beginning of an access procedure and cannot therefore be used by any other mobile station (MS1, MS2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of effecting random
access in a time divided mobile radio system having a primary
station and a plurality of secondary stations belonging to the
primary station. More specifically, the invention relates to a
method of access to these secondary stations when they are in an
idle mode, i.e. when the stations listen to messages from the
primary station within a given geographical area (cell) and when
they wish to establish some form of communication with the
primary station. The mobile radio system is a time divided
system (TDMA or CDMA) or a combined frequency and time divided
system (FDMA/TDMA) with so-called digital control channels,
which are utilized by the inventive method.Random access in a mobile radio system, for instance a mobile
telephone system, is known both for analog and digital systems.
Random access implies generally that a secondary station (mobile
station) transmits to a primary station randomly in time an
initial message in accordance with a given protocol, requesting
access to the primary station. The primary station then
responds, by sending a flag to the secondary station for continued
communication between the primary and the secondary
stations. The access protocol used in TDMA-systems, so-called
time divided or slotted Aloha, is described, for instance, in
EP-A-0,321,454.An access method with time divided Aloha is described, for
instance, in the U.S. patent 5,166,929 (Wing Lo). According to
this known method, access is effected by a mobile station by
sending to a base station reservation messages which denote
which time slot and how many such time slots shall be reserved
by the base station for the mobile station concerned, in order 
to enable the mobile station to complete its access message, so
called "Reservation Aloa". This known method can be used
particularly in a digital control channel and the access
messages can be sent in those free spaces that are created in
such a channel when certain control information (SACCH, DVCC)
normally used in a traffic channel is not used.An information transmission system is previously known by GB
2 063 011 A. In this system a number of uncoordinated users may
wish to signal to a central control point and this control point
is sending a command signal to the users when a channel for a
user becomes free. However, this prior art reference does not
deal with random access from one of a number of secondary
stations to a primary station.An access method is further described in IEEE Transactions on
Vehical

<CLAIMS>
A method of achieving random access in a time divided
(TDMA) mobile radio system, in which control channels and

traffic channels are formed by time slots within a frame, and
which includes at least one primary station (BS) and a number

of secondary stations (MS1, MS2, MS3), each of which intends
to send access messages in the form of short message words

(W1, W2, ...), each during a time slot allocated by the
primary station (BS) by virtue of the primary station sending

continuously a first flag (B/I) which denotes a state whether
or not a time slot during which a secondary station shall

transmit a message word to the primary station (BS) is idle
(I) or busy (B), so that one (MS1) of the secondary stations,

in response to the state transmitted from the primary station,
can send a first (W1) of said message words in the time slot

indicated by the first flag as idle (I), a second word (W2), a
third word (W3), and so on, in those time slots that the first

flag has indicated as busy (B), 
characterized
in that
the primary station (BS) sends simultaneously with said first
flag (B/I) a second flag (R/N) which indicates to the

transmitting secondary station (MS1) whether or not the
primary station (BS) has received said message word; and 
in
that
the primary station requests retransmission of only the
message word (W1) that has not been received properly in

the next time slot which is indicated as busy (B) by the primary
station (BS).
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
, after having received said message word, the primary
station again transmits the first flag (B/I) which denotes

that said time slot is continuously allocated the secondary
station (MS2) if this station intends to transmit more message

words (W2, W3, ...), and at the same time transmits the second
flag (R/N) which acknowledges whether or not the first message

word (W1) has been received by the primary station (BS).
A method according to claim 2, 
characterized
in that
 when the primary station has not received the first
message word (W1), the second flag (R/N) includes a request

for the first message word to be retransmitted by the
secondary station (MS) in the time slot allocated by the

primary station according to the first flag (B/I).
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the primary station, in addition to said first and
second flags (B/I, R/N), transmits continuously and together

with said flags, a third flag (R/F) to all secondary stations
(MS1-MS3), indicating that a given time slot is reserved for a

given secondary station (MS3) for the purpose of transmitting
a first message word (W1) from this secondary station (MS3).
