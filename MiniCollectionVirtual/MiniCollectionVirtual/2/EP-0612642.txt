<ABSTRACT>
In a method for gear changing in a mechanical gearbox with a main gear assembly and at least one layshaft assembly (3) and with a clutch disc (1) which is connected to the main shaft (9) via an automatically operated splitter (8), the gear wheels (11, 12 and 4, 5, 6, 7) of the main gear assembly and of the layshaft assembly (3) being synchronised during the selection operation, the procedure in the case of a gear change is as follows: in a first step, the splitter (8) is moved into a neutral position in which the clutch disc (1) is decoupled from the main shaft (9), after which the synchronisation of the gear wheels (4, 5, 6, 7) of the layshaft assembly (3) and then the recoupling of the splitter (8) are carried out.
