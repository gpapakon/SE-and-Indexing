<ABSTRACT>
A BiCMOS power driver circuit for interfacing to a bus comprises 
means (Q1) 

for channelling current from a power source to the base of a 
bipolar device (Q2) to pull the 

output all the way down to within a bipolar V
SAT
 voltage 
drop of ground, and then uses 

feedback (U,M3) to turn-off the pull-down circuit to conserve power. 
A similar circuit functions to provide Incident Wave Switching 
and Glitch 

Suppression by monitoring the voltage level at the output and 
sinking current as 

necessary to maintain a low logic level.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to combined field effect and bipolar transistor
circuits, and in particular to such circuits used as logic circuits for interfacing to another
circuit, typically a bus. Such a circuit is shown in U.S. Patent 4,713,561 which shows an electronic circuit comprising means for restricting collector saturation of an output transistor. The invention relates to
an electronic circuit comprising a BiCMOS driver circuit, the driver having a CMOS
input device; a first bipolar transistor having a base, a collector connected to a driver
output, and an emitter connected to a reference voltage node; a second bipolar transistor
having a base connected to an output of the CMOS input device, an emitter connected
to the base of the first bipolar transistor, and a collector coupled to a supply voltage
node; means for restricting the first bipolar transistor being driven into saturation.Logic circuits for interfacing to a bus within a larger system, such as a
CPU or a PC, are well known. As system performance has increased, the trend has
been toward using combined complementary MOS (CMOS) and bipolar transistors,
commonly known as BiCMOS. The major advantages are high speed and reduced power
dissipation. In the typical BiCMOS circuit, CMOS devices form the input and the
bipolar devices form the output. A commercially available family of such devices from
Philips Components-Signetics is known as the ABT Advanced BiCMOS Interface Logic.
All of the devices in this family will operate generally with a 5 volt DC supply voltage
source. Usually, the circuit output is directly or indirectly connected to a bus common
to a number of other circuits, and the input is derived from a part of the CPU or a
peripheral device. The significant point is that, during operation, the bus voltage swings
between the voltage source, typically 5 volts, and a reference voltage, such as ground,
and these transitions are interpreted as signals by interface circuits connected to the bus.A traditional zero-static power BiCMOS driver creates a high-to-low
transition by channelling current from the driver output into the base of a pull-down
bipolar transistor. This configuration is automatically zero-static power because the pull-down
transistor starts turning off as the output is pulled towards a bipolar base-emitter
drop VBE above ground, but the bipolar device cannot pull the output all the way to
ground. Typically, an NMOS device is added to pull the output the rest of the way  
down. Unless a very large NMOS device consuming
