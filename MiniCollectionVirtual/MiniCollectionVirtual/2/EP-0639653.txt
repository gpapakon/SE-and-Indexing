<ABSTRACT>
A connecting rod as a shaft clamping member includes 
a rod member and cap, each of which has mating faces at 

circumferentially opposite ends of a semi-circular recess 
and which are fastened to each other by bolts by matching 

the opposed mating faces to each other to define a crank 
pin hole by the two semi-circular recesses. The rod 

member and the cap are forgings formed from an aluminum 
alloy and simultaneously produced by forging powder 

preforms of the rod member and cap in a cavity having the 
desired shape of the connecting rod. After forging, the 

opposed mating faces have an infinite number of recesses 
and projections which are formed from the flow of the 

material during the forging and which are in a matched and 
fitted relation to each other. Thus, any misalignment 

between and in a direction parallel to the mating faces 
can be prevented to avoid the generation of a situation 

that only the rod member receives a stress. This achieves 
a prolongation in the life of the connecting rod of the 

aluminum alloy. The composition of the most desirable 
aluminum alloy include, by weight, 7 % ≦ Fe 15 %, 1 % Si 

4 % and between 1 % and 3 % of a metal selected from Ti, 
Zr, Mn, Ni, Cr, V, Mg and Mm (Misch metal) with the 

balance Al. The preferred forging temperature is between 
about 550°C and 650°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a shaft clamping 
member comprising first and second halves each of which 
has mating faces at circumferential opposite ends of a 
semi-circular recess, the first and second halves being 
fastened to each other by a plurality of threaded members 
in a state where the mating faces of both the halves are 
matched to each other to define a shaft-receiving hole by 
both the semi-circular recesses. Conventionally known shaft clamping members of a 
construction similar to that described above include a 
connecting rod for an internal combustion engine, 
comprised of a first half which is a rod member having a 
smaller end portion at one end and a semi-annular portion 
for a large end portion at the other end, and a second 
half which is a semi-annular cap fastened to the semiannular 
portion of the rod member by threaded members, 
e.g., bolts, to form the connecting rod which can be 
mounted on or removed from crank pin portion of the 
crankshaft of the engine.  
 In general, the connecting rod for an internal 
combustion engine is conventionally formed from a carbon 
steel for a strong mechanical structure. As one countermeasure for accommodating an environmental 
problem, a reduction in fuel consumption in an 
internal combustion engine for vehicle is demanded. To 
meet this, a reduction in weight of a structural member, 
especially, a moving part, is effective. In this case, a 
reduction in the weight of the connecting rods, which are 
moving parts, provides a large effect in reduction of fuel 
consumption. It is desirable to develop a lightweight and 
inexpensive connecting rod, in place of the conventional 
connecting rod made of steel. Thus, it would be desirable to form a connecting rod 
from an aluminum alloy, which is a light alloy, from the 
demand for the reductions in weight and cost. However, a connecting rod of aluminum alloy is 
resiliently deformed under relatively low stress due to 
the fact that aluminum alloy has a lower rigidity than 
that of a steel. Therefore, a misalignment in a direction 
parallel to the mating faces of the rod member and the cap 
is liable to be produced between the mating faces. This 
results in a condition whereby the stress is received by 
only the rod member, and hence, the life of the rod member 
is considerably shortened. To overcome the above disadvantage, it is effective 
to increase the axial tension of the bolt. However, if  
 
such a means is employed, a new problem arises that a seat 
surface of the
