<ABSTRACT>
A turning knuckle (1) as a connector between two components of which at least one can pivot about its horizontal axis. The essence of the invention is that: the turning knuckle consists of a hose or hose-like body of elastomer material in which there is, embedded between the core (2) and the covering (3) of the hose, a reinforcement (4) consisting of one or more layers of yarns running at an angle  alpha  which, in relation to the axial direction of the turning knuckle, is 0 DEG  or differs only slightly therefrom with the threads in crossed array; and that the turning knuckle is also fitted with radially arranged rings (7).

<CLAIMS>
A hinge joint (1,8,11,13,16) as the connector between two components,
where at least one component is supported to be able toe turn about a

horizontal axis, especially in the case of employment as the connector
between a bend (17) as a flow control device and a rigid or non-movable

channel portion (18), characterized by the combination of the following
features:


the hinge joint consists of a hose or a body of elastomeric material
in the form of a hose, having between the core (2) of the hose and

its cover (3) which is formed as a rib-and-groove system, an embedded
strength-carrier (4) consisting of threads (14) which are of highly

stretchable material and formed in one or more layers by running at
an angle α which - referred to the direction X axial to the hinge

joint - amounts to zero degrees or in the case of an arrangement of
the threads crossed at a maximum angle α of ± 5 degrees, deviates

only negligibly from zero degrees; whilst
the threads (14) running in the axial direction X are provided in
addition with threads (15) which run at an angle β which - referred

to the direction Y radial to the hinge joint - amounts to zero degrees
or in the case of an arrangement of the threads crossed or not

crossed at a maximum angle β of ± 5 degrees, likewise deviates only
negligibly from zero degree; whilst
the hinge joint is further provided in addition with rings (7, 12)
which are arranged in the radial direction over the whole length of

the hinge joint at a nearly constant distance Z apart.
A hinge joint as in Claim 1, characterized in that
the hose or body in the form of a hose consists of a rubber

mixture on the basis of polychloroprene (CR), natural india rubber (NR),
ethylene-propylene-diene-copolymer (EPDM), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR)

fluoro-caoutchouc (FKM), isoprene rubber (IR), butadiene rubber (BR),
nitrile rubber (NBR), butyl rubber (IIR), chlorinated or brominated butyl

rubber (CIIIR resp. BrIIR), chlorosulphonated polyethylene (CSM),
ethylene-vinyl acetate rubber (EVA), hydrated nitrile rubber (H-NBR),

or blends of these types of rubber. 
A hinge joint as in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the threads (14) running in the direction X axial to the hinge joint
consist of a material on the basis of polyamide.
A hinge joint as in one of the Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the rings (7, 12) have a spacing Z of from 30 to 1000 mm, especially
from 80 to 250 mm.
A hinge joint as in one of the Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the rings (7, 12) are of steel or plastics monofilament.
A hinge joint as in one of the Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the rings (12) are arranged ouside the cover (3) of the hose, that is
in the grooves (6, 10).
A hinge joint as in one of the Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the rings (7) are arranged inside the cover (3) of the hose, that is,

in the region of the ribs (5, 9).
A hinge joint as in one of the Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the ribs (9) and grooves (6) run essentially in an undulation.
A hinge joint as in one of the Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the ribs (9) are made in the shape of a crown and the grooves (10)
are made arcuate.
A hinge joint as in one of the Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the hinge joint is provided in addition with a compensator (21) of
elastomeric material, which serves exclusively to equalize the lengths.
A hinge joint as in Claim 1, characterized in that the compensator (21) is arranged between the hinge joint (16) and the
rigid, i.e., non-turnable component (18).
