<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a torque distributing 
drive, and particularly, but not exclusively, to a 
torque distributing drive for driving a twin screw 
extruding machine. Direct extrusion processes produce high extruder 
discharge pressures. This high pressure is generated 
from the extruder screws and typically is translated as 
an axial force back into a gearbox. The axial force is 
taken within the gearbox casing by a series of axial 
thrust bearings which can be arranged in varying 
configurations to suit the extruder application. Twin screw extruders have limitations on their 
torque output, due to the closely spaced output shaft 
centres. This limits the shaft size, bearing size, and 
gear sizes that can be utilised. Also it is usual to 
drive such machines from a single motor into the gearbox 
input shaft. The gear trains and lay shafts are usually 
arranged in such a manner, firstly to give a reduction 
in motor speed down to the required output speed, and 
secondly to split the single input drive into two output 
drives. The complexity of such arrangements usually limits 
the maximum output torque, together with: 
a) uneven torque distribution to either output shaft b) differential torsional wind up between output 
shafts, which in turn gives c) differential angular relationships between output 
shafts d) low radial bearing life e) high inertia gear systems. According to the present invention, a torque distributing 
drive comprises four parallel drive shafts comprised by first and 
second input shafts and first and second output shafts, 
characterised by first and second separate pairs of transmission 
means, in use one transmission means of the first pair of 
transmission means coupling the first input shaft and the first 
output shaft at a pre-determined velocity ratio, and the other 
transmission means of the first pair of transmission means coupling 
the first input shaft and the second output shaft at a 
pre-determined velocity ratio, and one transmission means of the 
second pair of transmission means coupling the second input shaft 
and the first output shaft at a pre-determined velocity ratio, and 
the other transmission means of the second pair of transmission 
means coupling the second input shaft and the second output shaft at 
a pre-determined velocity ratio, such that said couplings at a 
pre-determined velocity ratio fix the velocity ratio between said 
output shafts. Preferably each transmission means comprises a gear wheel 
which meshes with complementary gearing carried on the

transmission means (3) of the first pair of transmission means (13, 
3) coupling the first input shaft (1) and the first output shaft 

(13) at a pre-determined velocity ratio, and the other transmission 
means (12) of the first pair of transmission means (12, 3) coupling 

the first input shaft (1) and the second output shaft (14) at a 
pre-determined velocity ratio, and one transmission means (6) of the 

second pair of transmission means (9, 6) coupling the second input 
shaft (7) and the first output shaft (13) at a pre-determined 

velocity ratio, and the other transmission means (9) of the second 
pair of transmission means (9, 6) coupling the second input shaft 

(7) and the second output shaft (14) at a pre-determined velocity

transmission means comprises a gear wheel (12, 3; 9, 6) which meshes 

with complementary gearing (11, 10; 2, 4; 8, 10; 5, 4) carried on 
the respective input shaft and output shaft (1, 14; 1, 13; 7, 14; 7,

output shaft (13, 14) are disposed in planes which intersect with 

each other at the axis of the output shaft at at least substantially 
120°.

A drive as claimed in claim 5 characterised in that the 
relative angular relationship of the output shafts (13, 14) is 

adjustable using a right-handed helical gear (11, 8) and a 
left-handed helical gear (2, 5) as the complementary gearing carried

set the desired angular relationship of the output shafts (13, 14).
