<ABSTRACT>
A feed line to a pyrolysis furnace and a liquid 
injection apparatus for introducing a liquid coke 

inhibitor in the feed line are disclosed. The injection 
apparatus includes a central passageway for supplying the 

liquid coke inhibitor, an annular passageway for 
delivering an atomizing gas and a mixing reservoir for 

mixing the liquid and gas wherein the mixed fluid is 
atomized by pass
age through an orifice in a nozzle. A 
cooling jacket surrounding the annular passageway 

prevents decomposition of the coke inhibiting agent which 
products can plug the nozzle. The injection apparatus is 

typically installed in a bend of a process feedstock 
conduit with a discharge end aligned to an axis of the 

flow. A hot injection point close to the inlet of the 
pyrolysis furnace is preferred for best results. To help 

ensure complete evaporation of a carrier liquid prior to 
the furnace, the injection apparatus can include an 

evaporation shroud. For a modularized injection system, 
the evaporation shroud can include a larger diameter 

bonnet exterior to the conduit having the injection 
apparatus attached thereto. For a retractable injection 

system, the injection apparatus is received within an 
isolation valve having an outlet end stuffing box.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a feed line to a pyrolysis
furnace, and more particularly to an apparatus for the
hot point injection of a liquid coke inhibitor in a
pyrolysis process.A common problem associated with high temperature
hydrocarbon reactions is coke formation in the furnace.
Coke deposits can prevent proper heat transfer in process
tubes and increase the pressure drop through the furnace.
Coke build-up necessitates periodic process shutdowns for
removal of the deposits. Therefore, it is very desirable
to inhibit coke deposits by use of an additive which can
inhibit coke formation.The coke inhibitor can be applied as coatings to
metal tube surfaces prone to deposit formation.
Alternatively, the coke inhibitor can be added to the
hydrocarbon feedstock. In the latter instance, the coke
inhibitor is generally either dissolved or suspended in a
cold inlet stream.Recent developments have produced relatively
effective coke inhibiting additives which are ordinarily
solids, inorganic-based and insoluble in the feedstock.
Thus, an effective apparatus is needed for dispersing
these agents in the feedstock. Several problems are
evident, especially for hot point addition in the feed.
Solid additives must generally be introduced as a 
solution or suspension in a liquid carrier. Solvent
evaporation due to heat from the feed can result in
deposits and plugging in the injection apparatus. Liquid
impingement of the liquid carrier on hot metal surfaces
can promote metal fatigue in the lines. Consequently,
the liquid additive must be cool at the addition point
yet the solvent must be completely evaporated before hot
surfaces are encountered.U. S. Patent 4,647,367 to Urban et al. discloses
metallic phthalocyanine anti-fouling agents for
prevention of coke deposits in high temperature petroleum
reactors.U. S. Patent 3,034,726 to Peras describes a device
for atomizing a liquid using a pressurized gas. The
device includes an inner tube for the liquid terminating
in a nozzle and an annular chamber for the gas at the
nozzle. The device also includes a heating means for
vaporizing the atomized liquid.U. S. Patent 3,589,611 to Jones, Jr. describes a
distributor pipe for injecting fluids into a vessel
wherein the distributor includes a complete cooling
jacket for the portion of the tube exposed to theinterior of the vessel.
U. S. Patent 3,408,007 to Raichle et al. describes
an apparatus for atomizing highly viscous materials such
as a molten polymer with a gas. The apparatus includes a
