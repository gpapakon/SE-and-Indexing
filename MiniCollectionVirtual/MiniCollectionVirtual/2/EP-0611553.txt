<ABSTRACT>
The implement comprises two members (2, 3) which intersect in an 
intermediate region and are arranged to rotate one relative to the 

other; of said members (2, 3), that portion (21, 31) which acts on 
objects is positioned at one of their ends, and that portion (22, 

32) which is operated by the hand is positioned at the other end; 
the first member (2) passes through a through slot (4) provided 

within the thickness of the second member (3); said slot (4) 
defines within the member (3) two spaced-apart walls (33) which 

embrace the member (2); said slot (4) has a length such as to 
enable the two members (2, 3) to rotate relative to each other; a 

flexible strip (5) is provided joining together the two members 
(2, 3) to define the hinge constraint between the two members (2, 

3); said two members (2, 3) and said strip (5) are formed in one 
piece from synthetic resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a manual implement of synthetic resin, 
such as a forceps for medical use or a like object such as small 
scissors, comprising two members which mutually intersect in an 
intermediate region and rotate one relative to the other; of said 
members, that portion which acts on objects is positioned at one 
end and that portion which is operated by the hand is positioned 
at the other end. In FR-A-2024956, an implement according to the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed. The purpose of medical forceps is to clamp various objects, for 
example for squeezing flexible tubes in order to close their 
passage. Known medical forceps possess two separate members connected 
together by a metal rivet which defines a hinge pin. This results 
in various drawbacks. Firstly, the presence of the metal rivet is 
a hindrance to the recycling of a discarded forceps for recovering 
its synthetic resin. In addition, the clinching of the rivet can 
never be of a constant extent, with the result that the two 
members are sometimes pressed together too tightly or too loosely. The object of the present invention is to overcome these and other 
drawbacks. The present invention, as characterised in claim 1, provides an 
implement the construction of which is economical as it is 
formed by a single moulding operation, it therefore being  
 
unnecessary to assemble the two members together (they being 
formed already assembled). In addition to the preceding features, which are 
known from FR-A-2024956, the two members are 
properly guided because one passes through the other, one 
therefore acting as a guide for the other. They therefore flex to 
a lesser extent when subjected to force. In addition the implement according to the invention can be 
properly recycled as it is constructed completely of synthetic 
resin. The invention is described in detail hereinafter with the aid of 
the accompanying figures, which illustrate one embodiment thereof. Figure 1 is a view of a forceps for medical use according to the 
invention. Figure 2 is a section on the plane II-II of Figure 1. Figure 3 is a section on the plane III-III of Figure 1. Figure 4 shows the forceps of Figure 1 in position clamped on a 
tube. The implement of the invention consists of two members 2 and 3 
which intersect in an intermediate region and are arranged to 
rotate one relative to the other. Each member 2, 3 has at one end a portion 21, 31 respectively by 
which it acts on objects 9 to clamp them (Figure 4). It also has, 
at its other end, a

<CLAIMS>
A manual implement of synthetic resin, such as forceps for 
medical use, comprising two members (2, 3) which intersect in an 

intermediate region and are arranged to rotate one relative to the 
other; of said members (2, 3) that portion (21, 31) which acts on 

objects being positioned at one of their ends, and that portion 
(22, 32) which is operated by the hand being positioned at the 

other end, 
a flexible strip (5) being provided joining together the two 

members (2, 3) to define the hinge constraint between the two 
members (2, 3), and 

said two members (2, 3) and said strip (5) being formed in one 
piece from synthetic resin,  

 
characterised in that: 


a first said (2) passes through a through slot (4) provided 
within the thickness of the second said member (3), said slot (4) 

defining within second member (3) two spaced-apart walls (33) which 
embrace the first member (2), said slot (4) having a length such as to 

enable the two members (2,3) to rotate relative to each other. 
A implement as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
said strip (5) is in an intermediate position between the portions 

(21, 31) which act on objects and the region of mutual 
intersection of the two members (2, 3). 
A implement as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that 
said slot (4) has a portion (4') of width substantially equal 

to the thickness of that portion (24) of the first member (2) 
which moves within the slot (4), said portion (4') of the slot (4) 

and said portion (24) of the first member (2) being mutually 
engaged under conditions of sliding contact when the implement is 

closed. 
A implement as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that 
said slot (4) comprises, within the region in which the first and second members 

(2, 3) intersect when the implement is opened, a second portion 
(4'') of width substantially greater than the thickness of said 

portion (24) of the first member (2).
