<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a transportable power 
unit which comprises at least one motorized wheel which is 

rigidly coupled to a supporting structure with onboard 
power sources and electric/electronic remote-control 

actuation means; the motorized wheel is mounted on a 
swivelling support which is also motorized for steering. 

The supporting structure is provided with means for 
detachable fixing to a wheeled work station or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a remote-control 
transportable power unit for propelling wheeled work 
stations or the like. Structures having a platform or work station, such as 
for example household and industrial folding ladders or 
scaffolds that rest directly on the ground in a fixed 
position, are already known and used universally. Some larger and heavier scaffolds are mounted on a set 
of wheels allowing the user to easily move them by hand 
when he is on the ground. During work these structures must be moved constantly, 
and this accordingly forces the operators to step down, 
thus causing waste of time and efforts. It should also be noted that for tall structures, 
placement performed from the ground by the operator does 
not always exactly match the region where he must work. In order to solve these drawbacks, in a first case, in 
particular for structures for household use, a power unit 
and control means have been installed directly on board so 
as to make the work stations self-propelled. However, this has caused other problems linked mainly 
to transportability when not in use, due to the 
considerable extra weight. Further problems are due to difficulties in collapsing 
the structures for storage, due to the presence of the 
power units. In other cases, a solution to the problem has been 
attempted by providing wheeled and motorized bases with  
 
couplings in which the scaffolds are appropriately 
installed. These bases have a power unit and power storage units 
but cannot be disassembled without removing the scaffolds 
that they support; they are also particularly heavy and 
thus difficult to handle when not in use. The principal aim of the present invention is to 
provide a transportable power unit that can propel any type 
of wheeled work station or the like. Within the scope of this aim, a consequent primary 
object is to provide a power unit which can be conveniently 
disengaged from the work station. Another important object is to provide a power unit 
which can be conveniently controlled by the operator on 
board the work station. Another important object is to provide a power unit 
that is particularly suitable even for moving large 
scaffolds. Another important object is to provide a power unit 
which allows to precisely position the work stations or the 
like at the work areas. Another object is to provide a power unit that allows 
considerable time and labor savings to users. This aim, these objects, and others which will become 
apparent hereinafter are achieved by a
