<ABSTRACT>
A silver halide emulsion is described, comprising 
tabular silver halide grains having an aspect ratio of not 

less than 3.0 and a grain diameter of not less than 0.8 Âµm as 
calculated in terms of sphere in a proportion of not less 

than 50% of all silver halide grains as calculated in terms 
of projected area, prepared by a process which comprises 

desalting a silver halide emulsion comprising tabular silver 
halide grains having an aspect ratio of not less than 2.0 i
n 
a proportion of not less than 50% of all silver halide grains 

as calculated in terms of projected area, and then using the 
emulsion as a seed crystal emulsion. A silver halide 

photographic material comprising a support having provided 
thereon at least one layer containing the silver halide 

emulsion and a process for the preparation of the seed 
crystal emulsion are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide
photographic material having excellent pressure properties
which comprises an emulsion of tabular silver halide grains
which can be prepared at an improved producibility.The recent technical trend of silver halide color
photographic materials is toward the pursuit of high
sensitivity as represented by ISO1600 photographic light-sensitive
materials for picture taking and of graininess,
sharpness and color reproducibility satisfactory for
photographic light-sensitive materials for use with small-format
cameras such as 110 size system and disk size system
and photographic light-sensitive materials for use with films
equipped with lens as represented by "Utsurundesu Hi" and
"Utsurundesu Panoramic". A further improvement is required
of each of the various properties.In respect to these requirements, the use of tabular
grains intended for the enhancement of sensitivity, e.g., by
the enhancement of the efficiency of color sensitization by a
sensitizing dye, the improvement of the relationship between
sensitivity and graininess and the enhancement of sharpness
and covering power is disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,434,226, 
4,414,310, 4,433,048, 4,414,306 and 4,459,353, JP-A-58-113927
(The term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined
published Japanese patent application") and JP-A-59-119350
(corresponding to U.S. Patent 4,490,458).In order to make the use of the properties of the
foregoing tabular grains, attempts have been made to adapt
tabular grains in various size ranges. In particular,
tabular grains in a large size range are important for the
purpose of improving the relationship between sensitivity and
graininess and thus have been studied.For the prior art methods for the preparation of
tabular grains, reference can be made to JP-A-58-113927
(corresponding to U.S. Patent 4,433,048), JP-A-58-113928
(corresponding to U.S. Patent 4,434,226), JP-A-58-127921, and
JP-A-1-158426. However, these preparation methods are
disadvantageous in that they have a prolonged process time
required for large size tabular grains to form and thus
exhibit a poor producibility. Further, large size tabular
grains thus prepared are not necessarily satisfactory in
respect to the pressure properties of photographic light-sensitive
materials comprising these tabular grains.As a method for the preparation of silver halide
grains there can be used a so-called seed crystal method,
i.e., method which comprises the growth of seed grains which
have been separately prepared. By employing the
