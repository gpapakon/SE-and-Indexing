<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrolytic cell
assembly for the production of bromine for providing
brominated water for sanitizing a body of water such as a
swimming pool or hot tub. The invention also relates to a
process for producing bromine by the electrolysis of
sodium bromide in an electrolytic cell.The production of a halogen, especially chlorine, in
an electrolytic cell using bipolar electrodes or monopolar
electrodes for sanitizing a body of water, especially
swimming pools, is known. The Fair et al. U.S. Patent No.
4,714,534 describe a monopolar electrode system and a
bipolar electrode system, the patent being directed to the
use of trapezoidal shaped electrode plates used in the
monopolar electrode system.The Sweeney U.S. Patent No. 4,256,552 discloses a
chlorine generator for the chlorination of a body of
water. The generator uses bipolar electrodes.The Davis et al U.S. Patent No. 4,255,246 discloses
an electrolytic cell and method of making hypochlorous
acid from aqueous sodium chloride. An electronics control
package is shown that is coupled to a source of
alternating current and includes typically a rectifier and 
voltage regulator to provide for a constant but adjustable
direct current output voltage across the electrodes of the
electrolytic cell.The Davies U.S. Patent No. 4,917,782 shows an
electrolytic cell including a cylindrical casing for
housing a stack of electrode plates and mounting rings to
maintain the plates in a fixed position.The McCallum U.S. Patent No. 4,142,958 (also related
U.S. Patent No. 4,085,028) is directed to an electrode
assembly having bipolar electrode elements for use in
producing chlorine. The assembly runs on a.c. current.
It is indicated that the problem of unwanted deposits on
the bipolar electrodes is reduced by controlling the
electrolyte feed solution and by reversing the direction
of current flow to the electrodes.The Shindell U.S. Patent No. 4,263,114 is directed to
treating swimming pool water electrochemically. Shindell
uses a.c. current, and rectifies it to apply a
unidirectional d.c. current to a pair of electrodes. The
method includes reversing the polarity of the energy
applied to the electrodes, the feed water flowing past the
electrodes. The feed water is, for instance, pool water
to which sodium chloride has added to make it electrically
conductive.The Jansen U.S. Patent No. 4,306,952 is directed to
an electrolytic process for producing a halogen, including
chlorine and bromine, using an electrolytic cell with
bipolar graphite

polarity of the electrodes functioning as the anode and

the cathode in an adjustable polarity cycle controlled by
a polarity timer (25a), the polarity of the anode and the cathode being

switched to result in the bipolar electrode plates

a cathode on the other face whereby brominated water with
the desired bromine concentration is supplied to the body

of water,
