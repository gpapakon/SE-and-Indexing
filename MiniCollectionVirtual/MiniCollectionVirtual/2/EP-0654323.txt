<ABSTRACT>
Coatable compositions suitable for use in 
producing abrasive articles are presented. The 

inventive coatable compositions characterized by a 
combination of a free radically polymerizable 

composition, abrasive particles, and a photoinitiator 
system. The photoinitiator system characterized by a 

compound which cleaves via α-cleavage and has a molar 
absorptivity in dilute methanol solution ranging from 

about 4 to about 400 liter/mole-cm in at least some 
portion of the UV/visible spectrum ranging from about 

395 and about 500 nanometers. Abrasive articles 
incorporating cured versions of the compositions are 

presented, as well as methods of making and using the 
articles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to coatable compositions
useful in making abrasive articles. More specifically,
this invention relates to
coatable compositions which include free radically
curable compositions, particularly those including
colored abrasive particles and/or colorants.Three common abrasive articles are coated
abrasives, bonded abrasives, and nonwoven abrasives. A
coated abrasive comprises a backing onto which abrasive
particles are adhered with a binder, typically a
thermoset binder cured in a large festoon oven. The
backing may, for example, be selected from paper,
cloth, film, vulcanized fiber, and the like, or a
combination of one or more of these materials or
treated versions thereof. The abrasive particles are
typically chosen from flint, garnet, aluminum oxide,
alumina zirconia, ceramic aluminum oxide, diamond,
silicon carbide (either green or black), cubic boron
nitride, and the like. In bonded abrasives, a slurry
is prepared comprising a resin and abrasive particles.
The slurry is placed in a mold, the resin is cured,
typically using heat and pressure, holding the abrasive
particles together to form a three-dimensional object.
Examples of bonded abrasives include grinding wheels,
honing sticks, dresser sticks and sharpening sticks.
Nonwoven abrasives comprise an open, lofty, three
dimensional web of fibers bound together at points
where they contact by a binder, which may or may not
include abrasive particles. The above-mentioned abrasive articles may be
produced using addition polymerizable compositions as
binder precursors, wherein polymerization may be
initiated in a variety of ways, including, for example,
thermal decomposition of peroxides, radiation (particle
or non-particle), or a combination of the two. The
chain carrier in the propagation step may be either
ionic or contain a free radical.Addition polymerizable compositions, particularly
free radically polymerizable compositions, are useful
in producing abrasive articles. The free radically
polymerizable compositions significantly reduce or
completely eliminate the need for large festoon thermal
curing ovens in the production of coated abrasives.
However, the abrasive performance of these articles
depends greatly on the curing conditions, such as the
wavelength of non-particle radiation, the type and
structure of the article being produced, the chemistry
of the photoinitiation system used, the color of the
abrasive particles, and the like.For example, there is a wide variety of abrasive
particle colors, such that those abrasive
