<ABSTRACT>
Hot exhaust gases (from oxygen-based hydrocarbon-fire) furnace A made up 
predominantly of steam and carbon dioxide are used for reforming in reformer C 

a hydrocarbonaceous substance in the presence or absence of oxygen to 
produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Additional hydrogen can be produced 

by subjecting the carbon monoxide produced in the reaction to the water gas 
shift reaction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and 
more particularly to the production of these gases by steam and/ or carbon 
dioxide reforming of a high temperature waste gas stream from an oxyfuel fired 
furnace. Many industrial processes require the use of high temperature furnaces. For 
instance, certain inorganic products, such as glass and steel, are produced by 
heating a mineral charge to temperatures sufficiently high to melt the charge, 
which may be, for example, as high as 800 to 1700Â°C or more. Traditionally, 
the heating step has been carried out by introducing the raw material charge 
into a specially designed furnace and directly heating the charge in the furnace 
by combusting a fossil fuel with air in the furnace. The combustion produces a 
very hot gas comprised predominantly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water 
vapour. Various means have been used to recover heat from the furnace 
combustion gas, but because of the high concentration of nitrogen in the gas 
stream, very little has been done to recover or make use of the carbon dioxide in 
the exhaust gas. It was known that the use of substantially pure oxygen or oxygen-enriched 
streams as the oxidant in the above-described furnaces resulted not only in 
much hotter combustion gases per unit of fuel burned, but also in the complete 
elimination or drastic reduction of inert atmospheric gases, such as nitrogen and 
argon, in the furnace exhaust gas. However, because of the low cost of air as 
an oxidant and the nonexistence of high efficiency oxygen-based fuel burners, 
oxygen-based furnaces or oxyfuel furnaces, as they are more commonly referred 
to, were used only for special applications. Recently, oxyfuel burners have been developed which are efficient enough to  
 
render the use of oxyfuel furnaces for the above-described glass, steel, etc., 
manufacturing processes competitive with air-based furnaces, and the use of 
oxyfuel furnaces for glass and steel manufacturing processes is more common. 
Furthermore, because the exhaust gas from these furnaces is comprised 
substantially of relatively pure carbon dioxide and water vapour, it is now more 
feasible to recover or make use of the carbon dioxide in the effluent gases from 
these furnaces. US Patent No 5,006,141 discloses a process for the recovery of commercially 
pure carbon dioxide from a cooled glass-making furnace exhaust gas. Fuel in 
the furnace is combusted with oxygen-enriched oxidant. US Patent No 
5,057,133 discloses a process which

A process for producing hydrogen and carbon monoxide comprising the 
steps of: 


(a) burning hydrocarbon fuel in a furnace, and supporting the 
combustion with oxygen-enriched gas thereby producing a gas 

mixture comprising carbon dioxide and steam; and 
(b) contacting at least part of said gas mixture with 
hydrocarbonaceous substance in a reactor at a temperature and 

pressure sufficiently high to cause the hydrocarbon fuel to react 
with the carbon dioxide and steam, thereby producing a gaseous

oxygen-enriched gas feeds to said partial oxidation reactor are heated by 

indirect heat exchange with said gaseous product upstream of being 
introduced into said partial oxidation reactor. 
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, additionally 
comprising introducing supplemental steam into said reactor during step

carbon monoxide removal step is carried out by pressure swing 

adsorption.
