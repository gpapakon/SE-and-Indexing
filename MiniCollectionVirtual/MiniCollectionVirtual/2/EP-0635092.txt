<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for retaining and
releasing a closure (such as a door), and more particularly
for actuating a door release arrangement on a device for
holding open doors such as fire doors in the event of a
fire alarm being raised. Such a holding device is referred
to herein as a "door holder".Door holders are available in several forms. A simple hook
and eye is most popular, with other devices using friction
between the floor and a rubbing surface. There are
magnetic types available which consist of two parts with
attracting polarities, one being fixed to the door and the
other to an adjacent surface.Some such magnetic types are electromagnetic with the
supply current being connected via an appropriate fire
alarm system. The door release arrangement is hard-wired
into the system in such a way that it acts to cut the
electric supply to the electromagnet on activation of the
fire alarm. Hence the door is allowed to close and thus
form part of a safety fire break.Electromagnetic door holders including such a door release
arrangement are, however, expensive and complicated to fit,
especially retrospectively. Consequently many fire doors
are permanently held open with any suitable object that may
be to hand. This is often, ironically, a fire
extinguisher.It is known from US-A-4520503 to provide a tone
discrimination circuit for use with audible smoke or fire
detectors or similar audible devices, which automatically
emits an output electronic alarm signal, for notification
of persons at remote locations, upon input of a proper 
audio tone from the smoke detector or other audible device.
The circuit contains in series a microphone, a two stage
audio amplifier, a frequency detector, and a tone
discrimination circuit. The circuit emits an output
electronic alarm signal if and only if the audio input
signal has sufficient amplitude, the desired frequency, and
the desired duration.United Kingdom Patent No. 1570260 discloses apparatus for
retaining a door against the bias of a door closer. The
apparatus can be pneumatically actuated in the case of a
fire to release the door.According to the present invention, there is provided
apparatus for retaining and releasing a closure, comprising
retaining means actuable between a retaining state in which
it can retain the closure open and a release state in which
it ceases to retain the closure and hence releases it, and
means for actuating the retaining means to release the
closure; characterised in that it further comprises a
sensor for sensing from

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for retaining and releasing a closure (10),
comprising retaining means (106, 120; 206, 220; 320; 406,

420) actuable between a retaining state in which it can
retain the closure open and a release state in which it

ceases to retain the closure and hence releases it, and
means (160; 260) for actuating the retaining means to

release the closure; characterised in that it further
comprises a sensor (104) for sensing from the ambient

medium an alarm signal transmitted into the ambient medium,
and in that the actuating means (160;260) is coupled to the

sensor and is arranged to electro-mechanically actuate the
retaining means to release the closure in response to the

alarm signal.
Apparatus according to Claim 1 wherein the sensor
(104) and actuating means (160;260) are housed within a

common housing (102).
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2 including means
(126, 128; 331, 333, 353; 420, 435) for overriding the

actuating means to permit actuation of the retaining means
at will.
Apparatus according to Claim 3 wherein the retaining
means includes an engagement formation (106; 206; 306;

406), for retaining the closure open, which is actuable by
the actuating means to release the closure, and the

override means is adapted to permit actuation of the
retaining means in response to force applied to the

engagement formation.
Apparatus according to Claim 4 wherein the override
means is adapted to permit actuation of the retaining means

both in response to an opening force and in response to a 
closing force applied to the engagement formation in

respective mutually opposed directions.
Apparatus according to Claim 4 or 5 wherein the
override means is adapted to permit retraction of the

engagement formation towards the body of the apparatus in
response to force applied to the formation, and preferably

wherein the engagement formation is pivotable, pivoting of
the formation being arranged to cause its retraction.
Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims
including a battery holder (182; 282) arranged to hold a

battery to supply power to the actuating means.
Apparatus according to Claim 8 further including an
access door (188) to the battery holder, the actuating

means being arranged to actuate the retaining means on
opening of the access door.
Apparatus according to Claim 7 or 8 further including
a battery condition sensor (184), the actuating means being

arranged to actuate the retaining means if a low battery
condition is sensed.
Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims
further including means (176; 276) for switching off power

to the actuating means once the retaining means has been
actuated.
Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims
wherein the actuating means includes a bistable actuator.
Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims
wherein the retaining means includes an engagement

formation (106; 206; 306; 406), for retaining the closure
open, which is actuable by the actuating means to release

the closure. 
Apparatus according to Claim 12 wherein the engagement
formation is capable of frictional engagement with the

ground, in which case it preferably has an adjustable
reach, or wherein the engagement formation is capable of

engagement with a cooperating engagement formation.
Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims in
combination with the closure.
Apparatus according to Claim 14 wherein the actuating
means is capable of being overridden either by opening or

closing the closure.
Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims
wherein the sensor is an acoustic sensor and the actuating

means is responsive to sound of a predetermined character,
and is preferably responsive:-


(a) only to sound in one or more predetermined,
preferably audible, frequency ranges; or
(b) to sound of a predetermined continuous duration;
or
(c) only to sound above a predetermined intensity
threshold; or
(d) to any combination of features (a), (b) and (c).
