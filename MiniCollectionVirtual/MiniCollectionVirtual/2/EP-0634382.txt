<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the alkylation of
hydrocarbons. More specifically, however, the invention relates to the
control or suppression of the production of synthetic isopentane during the
alkylation of amylenes.Recently promulgated federal regulations have placed new vapor
pressure limitations on motor fuels resulting in the need to remove from
gasoline certain quantities of lighter, relatively high vapor pressure
components, such as, for example, butanes and isopentane. One problem,
however, which results from the removal of such compounds from the gasoline
pool is the need to find some other use for the butanes and isopentane.
This is a particular problem with isopentane since it can be produced
concurrently with the production of gasoline Therefore, it is generally
required for the butanes or isopentanes removed from gasoline to be
consumed as a feedstock to certain other processes in order to eliminate
the volume of such compound in the gasoline pool.A recent new concern that has arisen due to the new federal vapor
pressure limitations placed on gasoline is the formation or production of
synthetic isopentane during the hydrogen fluoride catalyzed alkylation of 
amylene olefin compounds. Traditionally, the production of synthetic
isopentane has not been much of a concern; but, instead, it has been
desirable because of the relatively high octane value of isopentane.
However, due to the aforementioned regulatory changes, the commercial trend
is now towards the removal of isopentane from the gasoline pool. It has
been suggested by those skilled in the art. e.g. U.S. 4,429,173, that one
means by which synthetic isopentane is removed from a product of a hydrogen
fluoride catalyzed amylene alkylation process is to separate the
isopentane, which can include synthetic isopentane, from the alkylate
product and charge it to a separate dehydrogenation step to produce olefins
which can suitably be used as an alkylation process feed. While these
additional process steps can effectively assist in the removal of
isopentane contained in an alkylate product stream, they do have numerous
drawbacks. For instance, the separate dehydrogenation step requires
additional capital to be invested in costly new equipment. Furthermore,
there are operating costs associated with the dehydrogenation of
isopentane. Finally, because of the separate and distinct process steps
associated with the separation and dehydrogenation of isopentane contained
in an alkylate product, it becomes difficult to control the net amount

<CLAIMS>
A method of suppressing the formation of isopentane in a process
for the alkylation of amylenes by isobutane in the presence of an

alkylation catalyst resulting in an alkylate product comprising synthetic
isopentane, comprising conducting said alkylation in the

presence of added isopentane, characterized in that the isopentane
is added in an amount to provide a weight ratio of added isopentane

to amylenes in the feed mixture of above 1.5:1.
The method of claim 1, wherein the isopentane is added in an
amount to provide a weight ratio of added isopentane to amylenes

in the feed mixture of above 2:1.
The method of claim 1, wherein the isopentane is added in an
amount to provide a weight ratio of added isopentane to amylenes

in the feed mixture in the range of 1.5:1 to 12:1.
The method of claim 3, wherein said weight ratio is in the range of
2:1 to 10:1.
The method of claim 4, wherein said weight ratio is in the range of
4.5:1 to 6:1.
The method of claim 5, wherein said weight ratio is in the range of
5:1 to 6:1.
The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein said alkylation
catalyst comprises hydrogen fluoride. 
The method of any of the preceding claims wherein said synthetic
isopentane formation is less than about 0.8:1 as determined by the

weight ratio of synthetically formed isopentane to amylenes in the
feed.
