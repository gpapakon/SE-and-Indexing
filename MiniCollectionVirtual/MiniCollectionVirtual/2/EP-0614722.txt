<ABSTRACT>
The method consists:   - in hollowing, on the outer surface (13) of the spherical bearing (1), a depression (13a) whose periphery is located at some distance from the two pole faces (10, 11) of the spherical bearing (1) so that it is bordered by elevated zones (13b, 13c); - in coating the entire spherical external surface (13) with a layer (2) of hard material; - and in machining the layer (2) to a depth such that this layer completely disappears from the elevated zones (13b, 13c) and remains only in the depression (13a).

A method of hard-coating a ball joint ball (1) having two flat poles, characterised in 
that it consists of: 


hollowing out a depression (13
a
) on the external surface (13) of the ball joint 
ball (1), the periphery of which depression is situated at a certain distance 

from the two polar faces (10, 11) of the ball joint ball (1) so that it is 
bordered by elevated areas (13
b
, 13
c
) ; 
coating the whole of the spherical external surface (13) with a layer of hard 
material (2) ; 
and machining the layer (2) to a depth such that said layer completely 
disappears on the elevated areas (13
b
, 13
c
) and only remains in the depression 
(13
a
). 
A method of coating according to claim 1, characterised in that the coating (2) has 
a hardness of at least 1000 Vickers. 
A method of coating according to claim 1, characterised in that the depth of the 
depression (13
a
) is of the order of 0.05 millimetres, the total thickness of the layer (2) being 
of the order of 0.75 millimetres after finishing. 
A method of coating according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
layer (2) consists of tungsten carbide. 
A ball joint ball (1) having two flat poles, characterised in that it is produced by 
carrying out the method according to any one of the preceding claims.
