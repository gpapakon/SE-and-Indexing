Device including a single articulated transmission rod 
(17) formed by several rod portions (17a-17b-17c-17d) which 

are mutually connected by laminar hinges (18a-18b-18c); the 
respective hinging axes of at least two preferably 

consecutive hinges are mutually perpendicular. The 
articulated rod (17) is made of thermoplastic polymeric 

material, and the laminar hinges (18a-18b-18c) interposed

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
transmitting angular motion between two rotating elements 
with oblique axes. Although the device according to the invention is 
suitable for various uses, one of its typical applications 
concerns the air vents of motor vehicles, where said device 
is used, by way of example, to transmit the angular motion 
from the rotating control knob, located on the front base 
of the vent, to the butterfly valve which adjusts and 
interrupts the air flow and is located in the manifold of 
the vent. The present description refers to this typical 
application, which however is non-limitative as regards the 
scope of the invention as defined by the claims. Currently in conventional air vents as known from e.g. 
FR-A-2 671 520, angular motion is transmitted from the rotating 
control knob to the cutoff and adjustment valve by means 
of conventional kinematic systems that include connecting 
rods with spherical heads, cranks, slot links optionally 
associated with bevel gear pairs when the axis of the knob 
and the axis of the valve are at right angles to each other. The use of said kinematic systems is evidently 
disadvantageous from an economical point of view, both due 
to the high manufacturing costs of the individual 
components of the kinematic system itself and due to the 
time required to assemble said components. Furthermore, said kinematic systems are subject to  
 
breakages or jammings and generally wear tends to stiffen 
the rotary motion of the control knob. The current trend towards shaping motor vehicle 
dashboards with ample curves furthermore forces to use air 
vents fitted with manifold ducts that are not straight, for 
example curved or slightly elbow-shaped and the like, and 
therefore the axes of the control knob and of the 
adjustment valve are often oblique or co-planar but 
incident. In these cases the use of the above mentioned 
conventional kinematic systems becomes troublesome and it 
is often necessary to locate said kinematic systems partly 
inside the manifold and partly outside it in order to 
straighten the curvature in the manifold itself, further 
increasing the manufacturing and assembly costs and 
decreasing the reliability of the control. The aim of the present invention is to eliminate this 
and other drawbacks and within the scope of this general 
purpose the present invention has the important object of 
providing a transmission device which is economically 
advantageous from the point of view of manufacturing and 
assembly costs,
