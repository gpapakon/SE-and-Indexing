<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a coated golf ball 
wherein whitening of color tone is enhanced and weathering 

properties are improved. The golf ball body having a cover 
mainly composed of an ionomer resin of the coated golf ball 

is coated with a white paint. A paint layer of the coated 
golf ball comprising at least one white paint layer and at 

least one clear paint layer. The white paint comprises 3 
to 15% by weight of a white pigment, 0.0005 to 0.0250% by 

weight of a blue pigment and 0.001 to 0.010% by weight of a 
red pigment, based on 100% by weight of a solid content of 

a coat. The weight ratio of the blue pigment to the red 
pigment is 0.1 to 2.0.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coated golf ball in
which the golf ball body is coated with a paint. More
particularly, it relates to a coated golf ball wherein a
whitening of the color tone of the golf ball is enhanced and
weathering properties are improved.A golf ball is roughly classified into three types, i.e.
a golf ball having a balata cover, a golf ball coated with a
cover mainly composed of an ionomer resin and an integrally
molded type one-piece golf ball. All three golf balls are
normally treated so that a white appearance is imparted
thereto.Golf balls having balata covers are coated with a paint
containing a large amount of a white pigment so as to cover
the slightly subdued color of the balata cover itself.For golf balls coated with a cover mainly composed of an
ionomer resin, the ionomer resin itself is transparent and the
white pigment may therefore be contained in the ionomer resin.
Therefore, the white appearance can sometimes be obtained by
providing only a clear layer, without using a white paint.
Even for golf balls having an ionomer resin cover, the
adhesion after weathering is inferior when only a clear layer
is provided. Furthermore, since the color tone depends upon
the cover layer, a sufficient whiteness cannot be obtained.
Particularly, the golf ball cannot be seen easily on green
grass and, therefore, it is difficult to putt. In order to improve whiteness of the golf ball to enhance
the commercial value thereof, U.S. Patent No. 5,029,870
suggests incorporating suitable amounts of blue and violet
pigments into a white paint. However, the appearance of the
resulting coated golf ball becomes dark white and, therefore,
the golf ball cannot be seen easily when it is putted.We have now developed a coated golf ball wherein the
whitening of color tone is enhanced and the weathering
properties are improved.Accordingly, the present invention provides a coated golf
ball in which a golf ball body having a cover mainly composed
of an ionomer resin is coated with a white paint, the paint
layer of the golf ball comprising at least one white paint
layer and at least one clear paint layer, the white paint
comprising from 3 to 15% by weight of a white pigment, from
0.0005 to 0.0250% by weight of a blue pigment and from 0.001
to 0.010% by weight of a red pigment based on the solids
content of the coating, the weight ratio of the blue pigment
to the red pigment being in the range of from 0.1 to 2.0.The white paint used in the present invention may be an
epoxy, acrylic or urethane paint. A
