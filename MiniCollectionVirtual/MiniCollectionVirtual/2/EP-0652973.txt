<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of nucleic acid hybridisation. Nucleic acid hybridization has great potential in diagnosing disease 
states associated with unique nucleic acid sequences. EP-A-552 931, citable under Art 54(3) EPC, discloses a hybridisation assay using branched 
nucleic acid probes having at least two target specific regions capable of hybridising to 
a target nucleic acid sequence and at least two arm regions having complementary 
sequences that hybridise together in the presence of the target sequence. In one embodiment of the present invention a method is described for 
forming from a primer and a single stranded template polynucleotide a 
single stranded polydeoxynucleotide having two or more defined sequences. 
The method comprises: (a) hybridizing a sequence B1 of a blocker 
polynucleotide to a complementary sequence T3 within a template 
polynucleotide ("template"), wherein the 5' end of T3 is 5' of the 5' end 
of a sequence T2, T2 and T3 being 5' to and non-contiguous with a sequence 
T1 of the template, (b) hybridizing the 3' end of a polynucleotide primer, 
comprising a second defined sequence, to T1 wherein step (b) is performed 
prior to, after, or simultaneously with step (a), and (c) extending the 
primer along the template and along at least a portion of T2. Thereafter, 
the primer extends along a polynucleotide Q having sequences S1 and S2 
wherein S1 is 3' of S2 and homologous with T2. An extended primer is 
obtained having a first defined nucleic acid sequence at its 3' end that is 
complementary to S2. Polynucleotide Q is either attached to the 5' end of 
the blocker polynucleotide or is present as a separate reagent. In another embodiment of a method in accordance with the invention, a 
single stranded polydeoxynucleotide having two segments that are 
non-contiguous and complementary with each other is produced. A 
combination is formed comprising (a) a template polynucleotide having three 
sequences T1, T2 and T3 wherein T1 is non-contiguous and 3' of T2 and T3, 
and the 3' end of T3 is contiguous with or lies within T2, (b) a primer 
polynucleotide whose 3' end is hybridizable with T1, (c) a blocker 
polynucleotide with sequence B1, that is hybridizable with sequence T3, and 
(d) a polynucleotide Q having sequence S1 and S2. Polynucleotide Q is 
either attached to the 5' end of (in other words is a part of) the blocker 
polynucleotide or present as a separate reagent. S1 is 3' of S2 and 
homologous to T2 and S2 is a sequence that is homologous to at least the 3' 
en
