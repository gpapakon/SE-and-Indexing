<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for determining the position of a piston rod (1) 
relative to a reference point, in which the circumference 

surface of the surface rod (1) comprises a substantially 
tangentially directed profiling (2) with a pattern repeating 

itself in the axial direction, comprising a magnetic member 
which has been fixed relative to the reference point for 

generating a magnetic field, which is affected by the 
profiling (3); at least two sensor (6) fixed relative to the 

reference point for sensing the strength of the magnetic 
field, and a processing circuit for processing the signals 

generated by the sensor (6), in which the sensors (6) have a mutual 
distance in the axial direction, which equals an integer 

multiple of the pitch of the profiling (2) plus or minus a 
quarter of the pitch, whereby the sensors (6) each comprise a 

magnetoresistive element being integrated into a bridge 
circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for determining
the position of a metal piston rod in relation to a
chosen reference point.Diverse solutions already exist for determining the
position of a movable piston rod. There are for instance
simple position detectors built externally onto the
piston rod, mechanical switches built into the cylinder
as well as acoustic and magnetic signal processing systems
built into the cylinder. All these systems require
components to be built into the cylinder or components to
be fixed to the piston rod, or a combination thereof. All
these solutions have limitations, such for instance in
the areas of sensitivity to malfunction, wear, limitation
of the stroke length, vulnerability, maintenance and ease
of replacement.The invention relates to an apparatus for
determining the position of a piston rod relative to a
reference point, in which the circumference surface of
the piston rod comprises a substantially tangentially
directed profiling with a pattern repeating itself in the
axial direction, comprising a magnetic member which has
been fixed relative to the reference point for generating
a magnetic field which is affected by the profiling, at
least two sensors fixed relative to the reference point
for sensing the strength of the magnetic field, and a
processing circuit for processing the signals generated
by the sensors, in which the sensors have a mutual
distance in the axial direction, which equals an integer
multiple of the pitch of the profiling plus or minus a
quarter of the pitch.Such an apparatus is known from EP-A-0115008.In this prior art apparatus the means for generating
a magnetic field comprise coils, located concentrically
relative to the piston rod. Consequently these coils 
generate a magnetic field, which extends substantially
axially relative to the piston rod. Axial displacement of
the piston rod will lead to a change in the position of
the profiling. However, this change will have a minimal
effect on the actual part of the magnetic field. Further,
this change is only measurable in a limited extend due to
the also axial position of the measuring coils. Expressed
differently, the coupling between the generating coil and
the measuring coil is only affected in a limited way by
the positioning of the piston rod. Consequently the
sensibility and the resolution of this known apparatus
are limited.The aim of the invention is to provide such a position
sensing apparatus, in which a greater sensitivity
and a greater resolution are possible.This aim is reached in
that
