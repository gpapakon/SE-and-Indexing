<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sanitary article made of plastic of a double-shell design, such as a shower basin or bath tub, and also to a process and an apparatus for its manufacture. In this case, each of the shells (3, 4) consists completely of a thermoplastic without any included reinforcements. The two thermoplastic shells (3, 4) are welded to each other without the use of an adhesive with the aid of the residual heat available immediately after deformation of the two shells (3, 4). The process is distinguished in that two thermoplastic blanks (5, 6) are heated simultaneously and, after plasticising, are deformed under a vacuum to form shells (3, 4) and are then welded to each other under bonding pressure. The apparatus (1) for carrying out the process has a spacing frame (13), which keeps the two blanks (5, 6) at a distance from each other during heating. All the frame parts of the spacing frame (13) are able to be displaced or shifted outwards. The mouldings produced in this way and any scrap produced during further working can be recycled completely, resulting in a closed material cycle conserving the environment.
