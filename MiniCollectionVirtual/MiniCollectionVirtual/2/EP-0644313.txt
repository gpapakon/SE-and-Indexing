<ABSTRACT>
Elastic sealing strip (12) for sealing door leaves in the floor region of the door-frame plane, having an elastic retaining profile (15) which can be inserted into a floor-side longitudinal groove (11) of the leaf and is designed as a hollow profile with vertical central web. In order to improve an elastic sealing strip (12) having the features mentioned in the introduction such that the permanent fitting of its elastic retaining profile (15) in the floor-side longitudinal groove (11) of the leaf is not impaired by the reaction of the sealing profile (13), it is designed such that the sealing-side foot point of the central web is connected on both sides, via oblique webs, to a door-leaf-side portion of the retaining profile (15).
