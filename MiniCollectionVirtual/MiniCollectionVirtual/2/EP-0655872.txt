<ABSTRACT>
A mobile station, i.e., mobile phone included in a cellular telephone system 
processes paging messages using a dual-port RAM memory connected between a 

signal processor (DSP) and a microprocessor (MCU). The paging message received 
and coded by the signal processor is transferred to the RAM memory, the identity 

number contained by the paging message is compared with the identity number of 
the microprocessor at the same time in the signal processor and only when they are 

congruent, the microprocessor is activated through a separate interrupt line. 
Because most paging messages are either empty messages or intended for other 

mobile stations, the microprocessor (MCU) can remain on as low a power level as 
possible during the paging of messages while the mobile station is in the stand-by 

state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for processing paging
messages received by portable devices such as radio telephones or message pages.It is a well known aim for designers of portable devices to minimize the power
consumption of such devices, e.g. radio telephones, in order to increase the
interval between the charging and replacing of the batteries for the portable
devices. Additionally, the likelihood of the portable device ceasing operation during
a working cycle is reduced if power consumption is minimized. Therefore, portable
devices, particularly radio telephones, are designed so that different power-consuming
parts can be shut off when not required so that only the necessary parts
required to "activate" the portable device are switched on.In a portable communication system, the portable devices are paged by radio
transmitted paging messages. The so-called paging messages are transmitted using
paging channels of the communication system to the portable devices, e.g. cellular
telephone, inside a given cell in different systems. The cellular telephone
recognizes, on the basis of these messages, whether or not there is an incoming
call for that cellular telephone i.e., whether certain parts of the cellular telephone
should be activated. These paging messages are typically transmitted, for example,
as signal blocks, signal bursts or as an FSK-modulation bit stream, using a
continuous carrier wave. The particular implementation depends on the
communication system. Typically, such communication systems have discontinuous
reception (DRX), i.e., parts of the cellular telephone are switched off between
paging messages and also during paging messages. This is the case when the
cellular telephone is in the so-called idle state (stand-by).In the stand-by state the power consumption of cellular telephones is mainly due
to the receiving and handling of paging messages. Generally the power
consumption is reduced by the power being switched off between paging message
blocks, but power consumption should be minimized also during paging message 
blocks or bursts.In known digital cellular telephones, for example, the reception of paging messages
is carried out in the following manner. Paging messages are received and decoded
in a digital signal processor (DSP) and the decoded bits are subsequently analyzed
in the microprocessor (MCU). A parallel or serial bus is generally provided between
the microprocessor and the digital signal processor. A drawback in this process is
that the whole
