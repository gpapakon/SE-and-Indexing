<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to two component acrylic reactive 
adhesives used for joining plastic substrates and more 
specifically, relates to a method and apparatus for extending the 
stability and clear neutral color of organic peroxides by 
preventing the degrading and discoloring of such peroxides when 
used in two component acrylic reactive adhesives. In the past acrylic bonding materials have been widely used 
to join filled acrylic sheets or polyester sheets. Such 
materials are commonplace in private homes or industrial settings 
as countertops for kitchens and bathroom surfaces. Products 
utilizing two component acrylic adhesives for bonding sheet 
materials are produced under the trademarks CORIAN, SURELL, 
AVONITE, and FOUNTAINHEAD. The aforementioned countertop materials are in high demand 
because of their functionality and aesthetic qualities. The 
aesthetic appeal is directly related to the success in the process 
of joining sheets or panels in such a way that the bonded area or 
seam is relatively inconspicuous. The seamless appearance of the 
countertops is highly desirable for both private homes and 
industrial sites. The appearance of a continuous, seamless surface  
 
requires a bonding adhesive that exactly matches the countertop 
material. Desirably the acrylic adhesives used to seam the solid plastic 
sheets together are prepared with pigmentation to exactly match the 
color of the sheets being seamed. However, it has been found that 
a problem exists with the organic peroxide solutions which initiate 
the reaction of the two component adhesives. The peroxide 
solutions turn yellow in color as a function of time and 
temperature. This yellow color in turn creates color matching 
problems between the seam and the plastic sheet surfaces resulting 
in conspicuous seams which are undesirable. With the advent of 
lighter and brighter surfaces being introduced due to consumer 
demands, these surfaces are even more sensitive to the yellowed 
initiators in the organic peroxide solutions. Generally speaking, two component acrylic reactive adhesive 
is formed by mixing a first component including resins into a 
second component housing an initiator. The mixing process takes 
place within a few minutes. The mixed adhesive immediately begins 
to polymerize and eventually solidifies, in most instances, within 
one hour. Normally the first component is formulated with an amine 
promoter which facilitates the timely polymerization of the 
adhesive. The promoter acts as an active source for the

<CLAIMS>
A method of preparing a two component reactive 
acrylic adhesive comprising the steps of 


forming a first component including an organic peroxide 
in solution in a sealed container filled with an inert gas; 
forming a second component including liquid acrylic 
polymerizable resin; 
breaking the sealed container allowing the gas to escape 
and filling the container with the second component and causing 

mixing thereof to produce an adhesive without yellowing in color. 
A method according to Claim 1 wherein said gas is 
nitrogen. 
A method according to Claim 1 wherein said container is 
made from a transparent material. 
A method according to Claim 1 wherein said container is 
made from a translucent material. 
A method according to Claim 1 wherein said container is 
covered with an opaque material until just prior to mixing. 
Two component pack for a reactive acrylic 
adhesive comprising 


a first sealed container housing a predetermined 
amount of an organic peroxide in solution and filled with an inert gas; and 
a second container housing a predetermined amount of 
liquid acrylic polymerizable resin for mixing with the contents of said first container 

after breaking the seal thereof. 
Two component pack according to Claim 6 wherein said inert gas is  
 

nitrogen.
