<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for forming 
a borosilicate glass film (hereinafter referred to as a 
BSG film) by means of a CVD method. Up to now, a borosilicate glass film (BSG film) has 
been formed by means of a CVD method under the following 
conditions of gas and depositing temperature: 
(1) SiH₄ + B₂H₆ + O₂ (400°C) (2) TEOS + TMB or TEB +O₂ (750 °C) (3) TEOS + TMB or TEB +O₂ (400 °C ), and the like. However, the as-depo film according to the above CVD 
method is mixed with B₂O₃ + SiO₂, and is not of glass 
structure. The as-depo means a state which is 
immediately after the formation. This film is poor in 
denseness and high in hygroscopicity. Particularly, when 
the concentration of boron in the film exceeds 5 to 6 
wt%, it abruptly becomes high in hygroscopicity. 
Therefore, it is not suitable for application to 
manufacturing process of a semiconductor device and the 
like. To improve this problem, the film can be changed to a 
film of glass structure by heating the as-depo film at a 
high temperature of 800 °C or higher. However, a high-temperature heat treatment needs some 
extra equipment and requires much time and labor, and 
some processes and interconnection materials used for 
manufacturing a semiconductor are subject to 
restrictions. Thereby, this method for forming a film 
has been kept from being applied to a process for 
manufacturing a semiconductor device.  An object of the invention is to provide a method for 
forming a film by which a BSG film with high denseness 
and low hygroscopicity can be obtained even immediately 
after the film has been formed at a low temperature. The inventors of the invention considered how an as-depo 
film of B₂O₃ + SiO₂ is transformed to the film of 
glass structure by heat treatment at a high temperature. 
It led to a conclusion that bond of Si-O-B was formed due 
to a high temperature. A film forming method of the invention forms a BSG 
film, using a mixed gas which consists of an 
organometallic compound having bond of Si-O-B (SiOB 
source) and ozone (O₃). With this, bond of Si-O-B is 
taken into the formed BSG film as its component as it is, 
and the as-depo BSG film has a glass structure. 
Accordingly, the as-depo BSG film is high in denseness 
and low in hygroscopicity. Furthermore, since the SiOB source becomes easy to be 
decomposed due to using O₃, it is possible to form a BSG 
film having Si-O-B bond in an as-depo state even in case 
that a depositing temperature is as low as 400 °C or 
lower. Thus, a film forming method of the
