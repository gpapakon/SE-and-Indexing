<ABSTRACT>
Block matching is a robust and simple method of motion estimation for television 
pictures. One important parameter in block matching is the block size. Large 

blocks give more reliable motion estimation than small blocks, particularly in the 
presence of noise on the input picture, but they produce a coarser motion vector 

field. However, if the motion estimation is being used for motion compensated interpolation, 
for example for upconversion between 50 and 100Hz display rates, 

the effects on picture quality of wrong vectors for whole blocks, and also of vectors 
that do not correctly follow the boundaries of moving objects, can be severe. 

According to the invention, large block (LB) matching is combined with the performance 
of more localized motion vectors to get pixel motion vectors. For any 

pixel, the motion vector will be one of four possibilities: the vector calculated for 
the block containing the pixel and the vectors (V1, V2, V3, V4) of the nearest 

blocks horizontally, vertically and diagonally.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and to an apparatus
for motion estimation using block matching.Block matching is well known as a robust and intuitively
simple method of motion estimation for television pictures.
One important parameter in block matching is the block size.
Large blocks give more reliable motion estimation than small
blocks, particularly in the presence of noise on the input
picture, but they produce a coarser motion vector field. If
the goal of the motion estimation is to provide a motion
compensated prediction, for example in bit rate reduction
applications, a suitable compromise can usually be found,
bearing in mind the fact that neither reliability nor a fine
motion vector field are necessary conditions for good performance
since occasional errors can be tolerated. If, however,
the motion estimation is being used for motion compensated
interpolation, for example for upconversion between 50
and 100Hz display rates, the effects on picture quality of
wrong vectors for whole blocks, and also of vectors that do
not correctly follow the boundaries of moving objects, can
be severe.US-A-5 162 907 discloses a motion estimation using block
matching, wherein motion vectors related to pixel blocks are
calculated and from the block motion vectors pixel motion
vectors are derived. The block matching starts with a predetermined
block size. If no 'good' vector is found the block
matching is carried out using extended blocks. From the collection
of 'good' vectors for a picture the three most frequent
are regarded as representing global motion vectors.
The zero vector is also regarded as representing a 'good'
vector. For each pixel in a block a specific motion vector is
assigned using either one of at maximum four 'good' vectors
(including the zero vector) from the current block and
blocks adjacent to the current block or one of the global
motion vectors. It is one object of the invention to disclose a method by
which the reliability advantages of a large block size are
combined with the performance of more localized motion vectors.
This object is achieved by the method disclosed in
claim 1.It is a further object of the invention to disclose an apparatus
which utilises the inventive method. This object is
achieved by the apparatus disclosed in claim 9. The inventive solutions are slightly different, but are all
based on block matching using large blocks, followed by post-processing
in which the boundaries between motion vectors are
fixed more precisely or 'localized'.
