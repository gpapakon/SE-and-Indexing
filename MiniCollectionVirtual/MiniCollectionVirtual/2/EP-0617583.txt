<ABSTRACT>
The foot described has a support arm connected to the leg, the other end of the support arm being fitted with a height-adjustable foot element (8). For this purpose, the foot element has an upper surface (12) which extends, at an angle ((alpha)) to the floor surface (10), towards the support arm (6) and which engages with a matching lower surface (14) on the support arm (6). Both surfaces (12, 14) have engagement ribs (16, 18) which run at right angles to the support arm (6). The foot (8) is connected by means of a stud (22) to a support element (32) which rests with the spring head pressed against the upper surface (38) of the support arm (6). The stud (22) passes through a long hole (30) facing the support arm (6). This design ensures that the height of the foot can be adjusted simply and reliably.
