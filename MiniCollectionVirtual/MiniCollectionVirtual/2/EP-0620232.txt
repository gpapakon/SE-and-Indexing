<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to certain aza
cyclohexapeptide compounds and to processes for their preparation.The azacyclohexapeptide compounds of the present invention are
useful as antibiotics, especially as antifungal or antiprotozoal agents.A number of antifungal agents are already known.FR 2340947 discloses tetrahydro-echinocandin B derivatives, useful
as antifungal agents.FR 2365554 discloses peptide aminoethers, useful as antifungal
agents.EP-A-0359529 discloses a method for the control of Pneumocystis
carinii, by administration of a lipophilic cyclohexapeptide.EP-A-0405997 discloses an antibiotic agent produced by the
cultivation of Zalerion arboricola, which is a cyclic lipopeptide. The agent
exhibits utility as an antifungal and antipneumocystis agent. The aza cyclohexapeptide compounds of the present
invention, Compound I (Seq ID Nos. 1-15) are characterized in having a
nitrogen attached to the cyclohexapeptide ring at the 5-carbon of the 4-hydroxy
ornithine component (hereinafter "C-5-orn") and may be
represented by the formula

wherein
R1is H or OHR2is H, CH3 or OHR3 isCH2CN or CH2CH2NH2RI isC9-C21 alkyl, C9-C21 alkenyl, C1-C10

-(CH2)2O(CH2)2- or -(CH2)2-NH-(CH2)2-RIV isH or C1-C4 alkylRV isH or C1-C4 alkyl; and
acid addition salts thereof.Where the expression "alkyl", "alkenyl" or "alkoxy" is
employed, it is intended to include branched as well as straight chain
radicals.The compounds of the present invention are generally
obtained as mixtures of stereoisomeric forms in which one form usually
predominates. Conditions may be adjusted by means within the normal
skill of the skilled artisan to obtain predominantly the desired isomer.
The compounds with preferred stereoisomeric form designated herein
as the "normal" form may be seen in the working examples with the
dashed lines below the plane at the "C-5-orn" position. The designation
"epi" has been employed for those compounds in which the group at the
"C-5-orn" position is above the plane.Pharmaceutically acceptable salts suitable as acid addition
salts are those from acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic,
phosphoric, sulfuric, maleic, citric, acetic, tartaric, succinic, oxalic,
malic, glutamic and the like, and include other acids related to the
pharmaceutically acceptable salts listed in Journal of
