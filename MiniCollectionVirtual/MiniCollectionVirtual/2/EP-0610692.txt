<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and device for controlling the rate of flow of fresh air in high speed trains with the aid of pressure wave valves. According to the invention, the object is achieved in that a signal for adjusting a drive unit (4) is determined from the number of passengers and the external temperature. This drive unit (4) moves a stop fork (3) into a flap stop position of the valve in the "open" operating mode; this permits the required rate of flow of fresh air to be provided. With the method according to the invention, considerable savings in energy occur since only the absolutely necessary amount of fresh air has to be heated or cooled and the period in which ventilation, instead of cooling, can take place is extended.

Method of controlling the quantities of fresh air 
in high-speed trains by means of pressure wave valves, 

characterised in that a signal for adjusting a drive unit 
(4) is determined from the number of passengers and the 

external temperature, whereupon the drive unit (4) brings a 
bifurcated stop member (3) into a flap stop position of the 

valve in the "opening" type of operation, which ensures the 
required quantity of fresh air. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the actual presence of the adjustment signal for the drive 

unit (4) is continuously checked by a control unit. 
Method according to claims 1 and 2, characterised 
in that, in addition to the parameters in respect of 

passenger occupation and external temperature, the required 
quantities of fresh air are also determined by additional 

factors which are advantageous for the saving of energy. 
Apparatus for controlling the quantities of fresh 
air in high-speed trains by means of pressure wave valves, 

for accomplishing the method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that, in addition to having a drive unit 

(2) for opening and closing purposes, the valve flap (1) of 
the pressure wave valve has an additional drive unit (4) 

which is connected to a bifurcated stop member (3) for the 
flap (1). 
Apparatus according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the drive unit (4) has a control unit (5), which is 

connected to the sensors (6) and (7).
