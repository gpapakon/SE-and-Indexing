A hydraulic mining excavator for an underground
propulsive means equipped with a longitudinal

conveyance means for excavated material, with a
boom, to one end of which an excavating tool is at

least directly attachable, the other end being
swivellable about a rotary mounting which has a

vertical rotational axis and is disposed on an
upper supporting member of the propulsive means,

furthermore with at least one hydraulic cylinder
for alteration of the boom inclination and at least

one other hydraulic cylinder supported on the boom
for operation of the excavating tool, which is

swivellable about a transverse axis, characterised
in that the boom (21) is hung on a console plate

(16) fixed to the rotary mounting (15) via a
driving system comprising a beam (18), pivotable by

means of a hydraulic cylinder (19) and the
hydraulic cylinder (20) for alteration of the boom

inclination, which is adjustable by alteration of
the length as a parallel driving means to the beam

(18).
A mining excavator according to claim 1, wherein as
a beam (18), two beam members are provided, mounted

on the console at a lateral distance to one
another, each having a beam adjustment cylinder

(19).
A mining excavator according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein two hydraulic cylinders (20), mounted on

the console (16) at a lateral distance to one
another, are provided for changing the boom

inclination and are adjustable as parallel driving
means to the beam (18). 
A mining excavator according to claim 1, wherein
the length of the beam is dimensioned so that the

horizontally-adjusted boom (21), in a beam end
position which is swivelled to the front or to the

rear, is at about half the height of the tunnel or
the propulsive means.
A mining excavator according to one of the
preceding claims, wherein the boom (21) is

swivellable upwards and downwards by approximately
30Â° in each case from its longitudinal position

achievable by parallelogram setting of its
swivell
ing cylinder (20).
A mining excavator according to one of the
preceding claims, wherein the propulsive means have

a lower longitudinal conveyor system (44) which can
be reached by the excavating tool.
A mining excavator according to one of the
preceding claims, wherein the propulsive means

comprises a track-laying vehicle with a roof plate
(36) on which the rotary mounting (15) is disposed.
A mining excavator according to claim 7, wherein
the track-laying under carriage (32) can be secured

between the tunnel roof and the tunnel floor by
means of props (34) which can be extended upwards

through the roof plate (36) or laterally.
A mining excavator according to claim 7, wherein
the roof plate (35) is supported by lateral

supporting walls (33) mounted on the track-laying
under carriage, on which the longitudinal conveyor

(44), which runs between them, is held with
adjustable inclination. 
A mining excavator according to one of the
preceding claims, wherein a tool-supporting unit

(26) is provided with a scoop (pick, splitting
tooth or similar) and a hydraulic hammer (cutter,

drill or similar) in a front fork (23) of the boom
(21), with a rotational axis located approximately

centrally, and is swivellable by means of the
hydraulic cylinder (25).
A mining excavator according to one of claims 1 to
9, wherein at least one additional boom member

(e.g. intermediate boom 52 and/or scoop stem 46) is
attached in an articulatedly adjustable manner between

the front end of the boom (21) and the excavating
tool (48).
