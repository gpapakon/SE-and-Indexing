<ABSTRACT>
A variable interleaving level memory wherein 
a plurality of independently addressable storage 

modules are present in a number between 1 and a 
maximum, comprising a circuit means (14) which, 

according to the number of the modules present and 
their capacity, responds to a first field of 

least-weight address bits (ALOW) and a second field of 
greater-weight address bits (AHIGH) input thereto by 

generating a module selection signal for selecting from 
the various modules present and a plurality of signals 

(MBIT) representing module address bits, thereby 
configuring the memory with the highest levels of 

interleaving and for maximum storage capacity, as 
allowed for by the number and capacity of the modules 

present and properly addressing each time the selected 
module.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a memory having
variable level of interleaving and related
configurator.It is known that in modern data processing
systems, the working storage unit constitutes a
"bottleneck" limitation to the system.In fact, while the various processors can
operate with very short operation cycles on the order
of tens of nsec, the working stores currently in use,
which are of the DRAM type for cost reasons, are
inherently slower, and the read/write time may be on
the order of hundreds of nsec.Each storage cycle requires a selection
operation for the memory location to be read or
written, which is the complexer and slower, the greater
is the size or capacity of the memory.To obviate this limitation, memories of the
so-called interleaved type have long been proposed
which comprise a plurality of discrete and
independently addressable storage modules.Thus, several modules may be concurrently
activated at one time for read and/or write operations.In practice, since the data addressing and
transfer operation is generally carried out through a 
single communication channel or bus shared by different
processors and storage modules, the memory access
operations do not take place quite simultaneously but
rather in succession.However, the read/write cycles overlap in
time to a large extent.The principle underlying interleaved memories
is that of the local and sequential nature of data and
instructions.In general, when carrying out a process, and
hence reading instructions or reading/writing data, the
information utilized is identified by successive
addresses.Thus, if successive addresses point to
different storage modules, the access to the various
modules may take place in time overlap.For example, in the simplest instance of a
two-way interleaved memory comprising two modules, the
bit of least weight in an address, which alternately
defines even and odd number addresses, may be used to
select, according to its level, either of the modules,
which are thus assigned to storing even and odd address
information, respectively.Interleaving need not be limited to two
storage modules, and a number N of address bits of 
least weight allow two storage modules to be selected
in a simple, quick and repetitive manner.Bits of least weight in an address mean here
those bits of an address which identify the information
unit which is read or written to/from a memory by one
read/write operation.This unit or entry may comprise one or more
bytes, usually a number of bytes equal to a power of 2.In general, the information
