<ABSTRACT>
A device for placing information/advertising (1) on the filler gun (2) of a fuel pump, comprising a carrying body (3) having at least one display surface (4) for said information/advertising placed over the head of said gun. The carrying body (3) extends in the longitudinal direction of the gun head and comprises an attachment component (5) which grips around the whole of or part of said gun head and/or the barrel of the gun. The attachment component (5) comprises, in a simple embodiment, an attachment band (5a) fixed to the underside of the carrying body (3) by means of expedient means, e.g., an eye/groove (6). The display surface (4) of the carrying body (3) lies in a recess (11) for the accommodation of the information/advertising label (1), which can be protected by means of a transparent cover plate (12) having pins (13) which interact with securing apertures (14) in an upwardly projecting edge (10) which forms the recess (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device attachable
to a filler gun of a fuel pump of the kind having in series
a gun barrel, a gun head and a gun handle, said gun
barrel having its rear end joining a front end of said gun
head at a first junction on said filler gun, and said gun
head having its rear end joining a front end of said gun
handle at a second junction on said filler gun, said device
providing a display surface supported by a carrying
body, for displaying one or more graphic messages
readily viewable by a gun user, means being provided
for detachably securing said carrying body to the filler
gun.A device of the above type is known from US A-5
058 637 which in order to overcome prior art placement
of a permanent advertisement on a part of a filler gun
boot fitted onto the filler gun head, viz. the substantially
flat region of the gun head, provides a platform for supporting
a replaceable message placard at said flat region.
However, said flat region only forms a small part
of the top of the filler gun.The present invention however aims at solving the
problem of optimizing the size of the viewable display
area, in particular when filling up the fuel tank of a car,
without causing any risk of damaging the car body adjacent
the filling hole therein and without the disadvantage
of having at least parts of a message non-readable
when carrying out such filling operation.This is achieved according to the present invention,
which is distinguished essentially in that said carrying
body has a first portion and a second portion each having
a planar top face, said faces having a common
line of contact to form an edge and forming a mutual angle with
each other when the device is attached to said filler gun,
and in that said display surface is divided into first and
second display portions disposed on said first and second
top faces, respectively, so as to meet and to form
an angle which is equal to the mutual angle between
said top faces, the entire display surface extending longitudinally
along the filler gun from approximately said
first junction to approximately the second junction.A larger display surface, with space for both information
and advertising, is thus provided in that the display
surface of the carrying body extends over a substantial
part of the length of the head of the gun.By way of example, the invention will now be described
more in detail in the following with reference to
the drawings, in which Figure 1 illustrates a carrying
body with two display surfaces at an angle to one

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device attachable to a filler gun (2) of a fuel pump
of the kind having in series a gun barrel (2b), a gun

head (2a) and a gun handle (2c), said gun barrel
(2b) having its rear end (2b') joining a front end (2a')

of said gun head (2a) at a first junction on said filler
gun, and said gun head (2a) having its rear end joining

a front end (2c') of said gun handle at a second
junction on said filler gun, said device providing a

display surface (4) supported by a carrying body (3),
for displaying one or more graphic messages readily

viewable by a gun user, means (5) being provided
for detachably securing said carrying body (3) to

the filler gun, 
characterized in that
 said carrying
body (3) has a first portion (3a) and a second portion

(3b) each having a planar top face, said
faces having a common line (8) of contact to form an edge and forming

a mutual angle with each other when the device
is attached to said filler gun (2), and 
in that
 said display
surface (4) is divided into first and second display

portions (4a, 4b) disposed on said first and second
top faces, respectively, so as to meet and to

form an angle which is equal to the mutual angle
between said top faces, the entire display surface

extending longitudinally along the filler gun from approximately
said first junction to approximately the

second junction.
The device according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the width of said display surface (4) is, at least
over part of its entire length, greater than the width

of the gun head (2a).
The device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
in
 said first display surface portion (4a) being substantially
parallel to the gun head (2a) and to the

gun handle (2c) and in said second display surface
portion (4b) being substantially parallel to the gun

barrel (2b).
The device according to any of claims 1 - 3, 
characterized
in that
 said carrying body (3) includes a
downwardly projecting peripheral skirt portion (7)

extending from at least that portion of the carrying
body which underlies said display surfac
e so as to
envelop the sides of the gun head portion (2a) of

the filler gun (2).
The device according to any of claims 1 - 4, 
characterized
in that
 said carrying body (3) defines
therein an aperture (5b) in its first end portion which

is disposed adjacent said first junction to thereby
secure said carrying means (3) to said filler gun (2). 
The device according to claim 5, 
characterized in
that
 said carrying body (3) defines a second end
portion for interlocking with said gun head (2a) at

said second junction.
The device according to any of claims 1 - 6, 
characterized
in that
 it includes a transparent cover (12)
having first and second surface portions forming

said mutual angle with each other, said cover configured
for removable attachment to the display surface

(4) of said carrying body (3) to thereby facilitate
changing of the graphic message viewable by said

user.
The device according to any of claims 1 - 7, 
characterized
in
 said carrying body (3) having a forward
portion (3a) and rearward portion (3b) which are pivotally

interconnected by a hinge portion (8), said forward
and rearward portions (3a; 3b) having a forward
