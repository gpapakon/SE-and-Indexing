<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel and useful ester
compound having the structure of an ester between a
quinolonecarboxylic acid and a steroid compound, a
method for its production, and the use of the compound.
More particularly, this invention relates to a compound
having the structure of an ester between the carboxyl
group of a quinolonecarboxylic acid and the alcoholic
hydroxyl group in 21-position of a steroid compound or
a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, to a
method for the production of said compound and salt,
and to an antibacterial composition and an
antiinflammatory composition each comprising said
compound or salt as an active ingredient.In bacterial infections, the first therapeutic aim
is to exterminate the bacteria with an antibiotic or
antibacterial agent. While the antibiotics heretofore
available are only sparingly active against MRSA
(meticillin-resistant Staphylococcusaureus), synthetic
antibacterial agents, typically quinolonecarboxylic
acid, are considered promising and under intensive
research. Meanwhile, bacterial infections are 
accompanied by inflammations in many clinical cases
and, therefore, the concomitant administration of
either a nonsteroidal or a steroidal antiinflammatory
agent is a routine practice today. Of these
antiinflammatory drugs, steroidal antiinflammatory
agents have the disadvantage that although their
antiinflammatory activity is high, they are prone to
cause immunosuppression as a typical side effect and
consequently increased susceptibility to bacterial
infection. In any event, the administration of
steroidal antiinflammatory agents call for the utmost
caution against the risk of bacterial infection. In WO-A- 90/1933
this problem was addressed using compositions containing a
chemically distinct quinolone antibiotic and an anti-inflammatory steroid.Under the circumstances the inventors of this
invention did much research on thought that any new
compound having both antibacterial and antiinflammatory
actions, if discovered, might solve the above-mentioned
problems. In due course, the inventors of this
invention succeeded in synthesizing a compound having
the structure of an ester between the carboxyl group of
a quinolonecarboxylic acid, which is a synthetic
antibacterial agent, and the alcoholic hydroxyl group
in 21-position of a steroid compound and a
pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof and
discovered that these compounds meet the above
requirements. The findings were followed by further
research, which has resulted in the development of
