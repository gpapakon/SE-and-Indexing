<ABSTRACT>
The method serves for operating an adsorber, in particular an activated charcoal adsorber for the selective adsorption of substances from aqueous solutions, in particular for water treatment. The adsorber is provided with an adsorber housing having at least one inlet port and at least one outlet port for the medium to be purified. The adsorber housing receives the packing comprising activated charcoal to fill its volume. The medium (water) is passed via the inlet side of the adsorber housing at intervals following each other with respect to time through regions of the packing following each other with respect to space within the housing in the direction of flow of the medium. The flow velocity of the medium in each of the individual packing regions following each other with respect to space essentially continuously increases between the respective entry into this region and the discharge from this region to the outside. The medium is passed at essentially constant flow velocity through the respective regions of the packing upstream of this last-mentioned region through which flow simultaneously passes.

A method of operating an adsorber, in particular an activated carbon adsorber for the 
selective adsorption of substances from aqueous solutions, in particular for water 

treatment, the adsorber having an adsorber housing with at least one feed opening and at 
least one discharge opening for the medium to be cleaned, and the entire volume of the 

adsorber housing being filled with the charge of activated carbon, characterised in that 
via the feed side of the adsorber housing, the medium is conveyed in chronologically 

successive portions through charge regions located one after the other within the housing 
in the through-flow direction of the medium, and in the process the flow speed of the 

medium is increased substantially continuously in each of the individual, successive 
charge regions between entry into this region and discharge from this region to the 

outside, the medium being conveyed at a substantially constant flow speed through the 
charge regions which are located in front of this last-mentioned region in each case and 

have medium through-flow simultaneously with this region. 
An adsorber, in particular an activated carbon adsorber, consisting of an adsorber 
housing (1) with at least one feed opening (3) and at least one discharge opening for the 

medium to be cleaned, the entire volume of the adsorber housing being filled with the 
charge of activated carbon so as to implement the method in accordance with Claim 1, 

characterised in that the adsorber housing (1) has at least one feed opening (3) with a 
valve and a plurality of groups of discharge openings (10) are provided, each group 

consisting of a plurality of discharge openings (10) distributed on a horizontal plane over 
the circumference of the adsorber housing (1) and the groups being spaced apart 

vertically, a valve (11
n
) being associated with each group of discharge openings (10) and 
the discharge cross-sectional area of each region being a fractional part of the cross-sectional 

area of the charge, the ratio being between 1 : 5 and 1 : 20, whereby the 
through-flow speed along the flow path increases to between five and twenty-times the 

total cross-section speed.  
 
An adsorber in accordance with Claim 2, characterised in that the adsorber housing (1) 
has the feed opening (3) in its bottom region, and a plurality of discharge openings (10) 

are provided above the bottom region and are vertically spaced apart, these discharge 
openings (10) opening out into a common discharge line (5) via controllable valves (11
n
). 
An adsorber in accordance with Claim 2 or 3, characterised in that a plurality of 
discharge openings (10) distributed over the circumference of the adsorber housing are 

provided on or in the adsorber housing (1) in horizontal planes located one above the 
other, and the discharge openings (10) associated with a horizontal plane are connected to 

the discharge line (5) via a collecting line (12) with valve. 
An adsorber in accordance with Claim 3 or 4, characterised in that the discharge 
openings (10) are provided in tubular rings (9
n
), and a plurality of tubular rings (9
n
) are 
arranged in the adsorber housing so as to be vertically one above the other and spaced 

apart. 
An adsorber in accordance with any one of Claims 2 to 5, characterised in that the 
discharge openings (10) or tubular rings (9
n
) associated with a horizontal plane are at 
substantially equal distances apart in the vertical direction. 
An adsorber in accordance with Claim 5, characterised in that the external diameter of 

the tubular rings (9
n
) substantially corresponds to the internal diameter of the adsorber 
housing (1), and the tubular rings (9
n
) are secured to the wall of the adsorber housing. 
An adsorber in accordance with any one of Claims 2 to 7, characterised in that the valves 
(11
n
, 17) are program-controlled. 
An adsorber in accordance with any one of Claims 2 to 8, characterised in that a probe 
measuring the purity of the medium is arranged in the discharge line (5) for the medium, 

and the probe is located in the control circuit of the valves (11
n
, 17).  
 
An adsorber in accordance with any one of Claims 2 to 9, characterised in that the height 
of the successive regions of the charge is a fraction of the diameter of the charge and 

consequently of the adsorber internal diameter, the ratio of the height of the individual 
regions to the adsorber internal diameter lying between 1 : 2 and 1 : 5. 
An adsorber in accordance with any one of Claims 2 to 10, characterised in that the 
charge rests on a filter plate (8) which is in the form of a perforated plate and is arranged 

above the feed opening (3) and at a distance therefrom, and the circumferential contour 
of the filter plate (8) corresponds in size and circumference to the cross-section of the 

adsorber housing (1).
