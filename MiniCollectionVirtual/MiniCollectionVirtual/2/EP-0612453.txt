<ABSTRACT>
A method and an arrangement for quality estimation when detecting an information frame, for instance a speech frame transmitted in a radio communication system in accordance with time division multiple access (TDMA), although the method can also be applied with frequency divided radio systems. There is used the soft information available in the radio receiver (RM, DM, DI, KD) which is intended to detect the speech frame and process this signal information in accordance with those principles applicable to known neural nets. Prior to use, the neural net (NT) is aligned to the radio communication system concerned. The invention enables better information relating to possible error in the speech frame to be delivered to error correcting units (TD) in the radio receiver.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of achieving improved
quality estimation when detecting information frames, and
particularly when detecting erroneous speech frames in
conjunction with channel decoding and subseqeunt speech
decoding in the receiver of a radio communication system which
operates, for instance, with time division multiple access (so-called
TDMA). The inventive method, however, can also be used
with frequency division radio systems (FDMA). The invention
also relates to an arrangement in a radio station using the
method.In a radio system which operates with time division multiple
access (e.g. TDMA), data messages and control messages are
transmitted in bursts over certain time slots between primary
station (base station) and one or more secondary stations
(mobiles).The primary and the secondary station both have a transmitter
and a receiver side. The transmitter side includes a speech
coder, channel coder and a modulator. The receiver side
includes corresponding units, namely a demodulator, channel
decoder and speech decoder.Speech to be transmitted from, for instance, a secondary
station (mobile) to a base station is speech-coded in the
transmission side of the secondary station and is divided into
speech frames prior to channel coding and transmission in the 
form of bursts in accordance with the access method (TDMA)
concerned.For instance, the speech coded signals may be divided in speech
frames (which are not the same as the TDMA-frames) with coded
speech samples and transmitted in accordance with a given
access method (TDMA). For instance, the speech can be divided
in speech frames each of 20 ms. This gives 160 samples at a
sampling rate of 8 kHz, which in turn gives 260 bits/speech
frames at a speech coding rate of 13 kbit/s.The speech frames are coded in the channel coder in accordance
with a given code, which may be a block code or a convolution
code. Some of the bits in a speech frame are more sensitive,
i.e. carry more important information and it is thus more
important that these bits can be received correctly.These more sensitive bits can be protected, by adding redundant
parity bits in the channel coder. These redundant bits can be
used for error detection and/or error correction of bit errors
later on in the receiver. The so-called bit error rate (i.e.
quality) of a received message, e.g. a speech frame, may also
be estimated in the receiver. When a bit-containing frame is
received, the channel decoder uses the redundant bits to
correct the most sensitive bits. If it

A method of estimating the quality of an information frame

are transmitted between a primary station and one or more
secondary stations (MS) in accordance with a given access

possible frame error when decoding at least a part of the

recovering a number of signal values (sm,sj,sb) each

the receiver side of a primary or secondary station processed

a) multiplying each of all said recovered signal values with

predetermined coefficients;

a transmitted version of the same information frame over said

radio channel and processed through said receiver stages,
