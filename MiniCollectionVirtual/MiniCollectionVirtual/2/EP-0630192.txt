<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to psyllium-containing drink mix 
compositions comprising acid and granulated, less water soluble base. 
These compositions have improved aesthetics to encourage consumer 
compliance with a prescribed dosing regimen. Products containing larger particle size psyllium seed husk with 
citric acid and carbonate salts (e.g., potassium bicarbonate; sodium 
bicarbonate; and/or calcium carbonate) are known, for example Effervescent 
Metamucil® sold by The Procter & Gamble Company (Physicians 
Desk Reference for Nonprescription Drugs, 10th Edition, page 642; 
copyright 1989). These Metamucil products generate carbon dioxide upon 
mixing with water, which assists in the mixing process. The resulting 
product has a distinct tart/sour taste which is compatible with the 
flavors used (lemon-lime; orange). CA-A-2 030 448 describes a psyllium drink 
edible acid and edible base. US 4,824,672 describes a pharmaceutical composition for use in reducing serum, 
cholesterol levels, which contain gel-forming fibers and a mineral salt. It has been discovered by the present invention that psyllium-containing 
drink mix compositions containing acid and certain less 
water soluble bases (e.g., calcium carbonate) have improved aesthetics 
when the base is in granulated form in the drink mix compositions. 
This is especially preferred when small particle size psyllium husk is 
utilized, when the pH of the drink mix in water is elevated and/or when 
the composition is prepared as an unflavored composition. An object of the present invention is therefore to provide 
psyllium-containing drink mix compositions having acceptable aesthetics, 
including reduced psyllium gellation rate, good mixability, good 
suspendability, good taste, and acceptable texture. These and other 
objects of the present invention will become readily apparent from the 
detailed description which follows. All percentages and ratios used herein are by weight, and all 
measurements made at 25°C, unless otherwise specified. Screen mesh 
sizes used herein are based on U.S. standards unless otherwise stated. The present invention relates to psyllium-containing drink mix 
compositions as defined by the claims and comprising: 
(a) from about 10% to about 99% psyllium husk; (b) from about 0% to about 89% carrier materials;  
 (c) from about 0.5% to about 25% edible acid; and (d) from about 0.5% to about 25% edible granulated, less water 
soluble base. The drink mix compositions of the present invention are psyllium-containing 
compositions
