<ABSTRACT>
Color-containing alkanolamines or alkyleneamines, having color 
numbers of up to 100 PtCo or higher, can be treated with polymeric 

solid acidic catalysts at elevated temperatures. Perfluorinated ionexchange 
polymers in the acid form may be used as the polymeric solid 

acidic catalyst. In the presence of added water, these polymeric solid 
acidic catalysts produce decolorized alkanolamines or alkyleneamines 

having color numbers of 20 PtCo or less. The process of decolorization 
can be carried out in batch or continuous mode processes thus 

providing low cost, high quality and high purity end products.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes for
decolorizing alkanolamines and, more particularly, to
both batch and continuous processes for producing
alkanolamines having improved color characteristics by
treatment with polymeric solid acidic catalyst.Price and purity are important characteristics of
a chemical's marketability to a potential customer.
During industrial processes used to produce various
chemicals, impurities often enter the processes and
manifest themselves in the form of color contamination.
The sources of this color contamination may be
metals and metal compounds from the catalysts or
equipment used in the processes, or conjugated organic
compounds which are formed during the processes. Since
the mechanism by which these color contaminants are
formed varies from process to process, the
decolorization process normally acts by a mechanism
which depends on the color source.Alkanolamines may be conventionally prepared by
reacting an alkylene oxide with ammonia or an amine,
or, more particularly, alkanolamines such as
aminoethylethanolamine may typically be prepared by
the reductive amination of monoethanolamine.Alkanolamines produced by these conventional
processes can vary in color from nearly colorless
water-white liquids to pale yellow. Alkanolamines,
particularly ethanolamines, are susceptible to color
formation in the presence of oxygen (e.g. from air
leaks during manufacture and/or storage), excessive
temperature and soluble metals such as iron or nickel. 
Also, impurities in raw materials may contribute to
the initial and continuing formation of color bodies.Various attempts to overcome the problems
associated with color and color instability of
alkanolamines have proven to be cost intensive and
environmentally unacceptable. Such attempts have
included purification by fractional distillation,
concentration of color forming bodies or their
precursors by fractional distillation, carbon
treatment, the use of adsorbent materials, various
hydrogenation techniques, and the use of reducing
agents such as sodium borohydride and hydrazine.US-A-2 744 938 describes a process for
the treatment of color-sensitive organic compounds
which have become discolored through oxidation or upon
aging. The patent specifically describes the method of
removal of color bodies from alkylphenols with a
catalyst free solid adsorbent in the presence of
hydrogen maintained at super atmospheric pressure. The
thus treated alkylphenol is then separated from the
solid adsorbent material.US-A-3,207,790 describes a
