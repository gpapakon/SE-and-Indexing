<ABSTRACT>
A thermal ink jet printing module, of the type 
that can be removably mounted on the carriage of a 

printer, comprises a reservoir (12) for the ink and a 
thermal ink jet printing head (28) fixed to and 

communicating with the reservoir, and a housing (40) 
integral with the reservoir for receiving an ink refill 

cartridge (42) for supplying the spent module with fresh 
ink by means of a transfer element (63) integral with the 

housing (60) of the cartridge. Successive refilling of 

the printing module exploits the working life of the head 
to the utmost and reduces the waste of expensive 

materials. The reservoir can be refilled relatively 
easily, even when the user is travelling.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a refillable ink jet
printing module, and more particularly to a so-called
integrated thermal ink jet printing module comprising a
thermal printing head integral with the associated
reservoir for the ink, of the type removably mounted on
the carriage of ink jet printers, for example those
associated with a personal computer.Printing modules of the type mentioned are
known in the art. For example an integral printing module
which can be removably inserted in a printer is known from
International (PCT) Patent Application WO 91/04861
published on April 18, 1991 (corresponding United States
Patent 5,317,339 issued May 31, 1994). The reservoir for
the ink contains a spongy body impregnated with ink, and
the printing head is formed by a plate integral with the
reservoir and provided with a plurality of nozzles from
which the ink is expelled by means of a rapid increase in
pressure in compression chambers connected to the nozzles.The working life of the ink contained in the
reservoir is normally much shorter than the life of the
head and it is therefore very expensive to replace a spent
module with another one full of ink as this involves the
loss of a printing head which is still in working order.The problem of the replacement of a spent
integral module and the consequent loss of the associated
printing head still in working order is particularly
apparent in the case of the small printers associated with
a portable (lap top) Personal computer. In equipment of
this kind, the ink jet printing module generally has small
dimensions and can contain approximately 6 cm3 of ink. It
therefore has to be replaced more frequently than in the
case of desk-top printers. Moreover, given the specific
use of this equipment, used mainly by people working while
travelling, the replacement of a spent integral module
involves considerable practical problems, for instance the
need to have a supply of new modules close at hand, 
thereby taking up more luggage space.The storage or disposal of spent modules also
poses problems in certain circumstances. The replacement
of a spent module is generally a simple operation carried
out calmly in a quiet place. However, in the case of a
user travelling on a means of transport, operations of
this kind can become extremely awkward and complicated,
with the risk of incorrect mounting of the new module,
making it impossible to continue with the printing already
started. All of these disadvantages cause long
interruptions to printing, possibly leading to a loss of
print

<CLAIMS>
An ink jet printing module (10, 112) and an ink
cartridge (42,110) for refilling said printing module with

a fresh ink supply, said ink cartridge comprising a
transfer element (62) for transferring said fresh ink

supply; said module comprising:

a reservoir (12);
an absorbent body (34) contained in said
reservoir and impregnated with ink;
a thermal ink jet printing head (28) fixed to
and communicating with said reservoir;
housing means (40,116) integral with said
reservoir for receiving and housing said ink cartridge;

and
connecting means (50,118) provided on said
housing means for selectively connecting hydraulically

said reservoir to said transfer element (62) of said ink
cartridge in said housing means to transfer said fresh ink

supply from said cartridge to said reservoir;

   characterised in that said housing means
(40,116) comprises a first stop (122) for holding said

cartridge in a first position separated from said
connecting means, and a second stop (123) for holding said

cartridge in a second position in engagement with said
connecting means, and said cartridge comprises a stop

element (120) cooperating selectively with said first and
said second stop.
A printing module and cartridge as claimed in
claim 1, in which said connecting means (50) comprises a

hollow tubular element (53,118), and said transfer element 
(62) comprises a closure (63) of soft impermeable material

adapted to be pierced by said tubular element.
A printing module and cartridge as claimed in
claim 1, in which said connecting means (50) comprises an

orifice (52) communicating with said reservoir and with
said housing means, and said transfer element (62)

comprises a capillary member (88) mounted on said
cartridge and adapted to contact said absorbent body (34)

through said orifice.
A printing module and cartridge as claimed in
any one of the preceding claims, in which said cartridge

(42) comprises a closing cover (66) at an opposite end of
said cartridge from said transfer element (62), said cover

having a diaphragm (78), and a hollow cylindrical body
(72) slidable in said cover and having a first end (74) to

the exterior of said cartridge and a second end (76)
adapted to break open said diaphragm (78) of said cover,

and ink is allowed to transfer from said cartridge to said
reservoir as a result of external atmospheric pressure

when said second end breaks said diaphragm.
A printing module and cartridge as claimed in
claim 4, in which said first end (74) of said hollow

cylindrical body (72) has the form of a button, and said

second end (76) of said hollow cylindrical body (72) has
the form of a nail. 
A printing module and cartridge as claimed in
any of the preceding claims, in which said absorbent body

(34) is made of a material selected in a group consisting
of sponge, bundle of fibres, package of non-woven fabric

and layers of non-woven fabric.
A printing module and cartridge as claimed in
any of the preceding claims, in which the volume of said

fresh ink supply is substantially equal to 
1
/
3
