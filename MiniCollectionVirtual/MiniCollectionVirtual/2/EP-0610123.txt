<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for processing seismic data, in which a volume of raw focusing data (20) is constructed on the basis of back-extrapolation of seismic data obtained by means of at least one seismic source and sensors arranged on the surface along a prospecting section at regular baseline separations. For a subassembly of the said volume which corresponds to a given extrapolation depth (Ze), and for a connected set of baseline points on the prospecting section, a downward shift is carried out, with zero offset, until reaching a first set of depths which are greater than the said extrapolation depth, in order to construct a first block of shifted focusing-analysis data, as well as a reverse shift, with zero offset, upwards to a second set of depths which are less than the said extrapolation depth, in order to construct a second block of shifted focusing-analysis data. The first and second data blocks are combined for each extrapolation depth and a focusing panel is constructed, which is subsequently processed by focusing analysis, with a view to obtaining a better estimation of the propagation velocities of the seismic waves in the substratum.

A method of treating seismic data in which, in conventional 
manner, a volume of raw focusing data (10) is constituted by 

downwards extrapolation for a given set of extrapolation depths of 
surface seismic data obtained by means of a seismic source (1) and of 

sensors (2) regularly disposed along a prospecting section at 

abscissas (S, G), characterized in that for a subset (20) of said 
volume of raw focusing data corresponding to a given extrapolation 

depth (Z
e
) and over a contiguous interval of abscissas along the 
prospecting section, the method comprises the steps consisting in: 


a) performing zero offset downwards migration on said subset of 
raw focusing data to a first set of imaging depths (Z
img1
) greater 
than said extrapolation depth (Z
e
) and applying a selected time 
condition to the migrated data in order to constitute a first block 

of focusing analysis migrated data; 
b) performing inverse zero offset migration in an upwards 
direction on said subset of raw focusing data to a second set of 

imaging depths (Z
img2
) less than said extrapolation depth (Z
e
), and 
applying a selected time condition to the migrated data in order to 

constitute a second block of focusing analysis migrated data; 
c) uniting the first and second blocks of focusing analysis 
migrated data obtained for each extrapolation depth (Z
e
) of said 
subset in order to constitute a volume (40) of focusing analysis 

migrated data; and 
 
   constructing a focusing panel (P1) by extracting a subset at 

constant abscissa (X') from said volume of focusing analysis migrated 
data, said focusing panel subsequently being processed in 

conventional manner by focusing analysis in order to obtain an 
improved estimate of seismic wave propagation velocities underground.
