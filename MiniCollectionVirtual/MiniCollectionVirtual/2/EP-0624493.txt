<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of roof rails for vehicles, having a tubular bar (1) and supporting feet (2, 22) which support said bar at least at the end regions, but optionally also in the centre, and are fixed thereon in each case by means of a threaded bolt (6) and a nut (9) screwed thereon. A connection arrangement which is particularly simple to produce is intended to be achieved here in that the threaded bolt (6) has a head (5), in the manner of a hammer-head bolt, which can be plugged through a slotted opening (4, 44) in the bar (1) and can be fixed axially on the bar (1) by a rotation through 90@ and in that two axial sub-regions of the bolt shank are designed as a square (7, 8) for radial fixing of the threaded bolt (6) in the slotted opening (4, 44) of the bar (1) and a square socket (10) in the associated supporting foot (2).

<CLAIMS>
Roof railing for motor vehicles with a tubular side 
rail (1) and brackets (2, 22) to support the same at 

least at the ends and, if indicated, also at the 
center, secured to the same in each case by means of 

a threaded stud (6) and a nut (9) screwed onto the 
same, characterized by the threaded stud (6) 

exhibiting a head (5) in the style of a hammer-head 
bolt which can be passed through a slot (4, 44) in 

the side rail (1), being able to be secured axially 
at the side rail (1) by way of a 90Â° rotational 

movement, by two axial sections of the stud shaft 
being in the form of a square (7, 8) to ensure 

radial securing of the threaded stud (6) in the slot 
(4, 44) at the side rail (1) and by a square hole 

(10) being formed in the associated bracket (2). 
Roof railing in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterized by the slots (4) formed at the contact 

surface at the ends of the side railing (1) being 
open at one end. 
Roof railing in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized by each bracket (2) exhibiting a metal 

sleeve (11) with square hole (10), this metal sleeve 
(11) being seated in one of the plastic caps (12) 

forming the outside contour of the particular 
bracket (2).
