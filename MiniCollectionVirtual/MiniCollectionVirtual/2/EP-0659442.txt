<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for manufacturing medical articles, such as catheters, tubes, containers, shaped parts and the like, made of polymer materials. These articles have a special provision for increasing the blood compatibility when they come into contact with blood or fluids which are similar to blood. The characteristic feature of the invention is that a defined quantity of an additive is deposited on the individual granular particles of the polymer material before they are thermoplasticised. This additive is soluble in the polymer melt but is immiscible with the polymer in the vitreous state. The granular particles treated in this way are then thermoplasticised and are processed to give the end product.
