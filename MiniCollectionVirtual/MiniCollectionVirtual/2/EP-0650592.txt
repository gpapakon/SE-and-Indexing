<ABSTRACT>
A device (1) has radiation sources (5, 15, 21) arranged one after the other in the direction of transport (4) of a board-shaped workpiece (3). The sources emit radiation (6, 13, 14) of increasing energy towards a target spot (7, 16, 22) of the workpiece (3). The radiation consequently penetrates down to increasing depths (8, 17, 23) of the thickness (2) of the workpiece (3). The corresponding backscattered radiation (9, 18, 24) is sensed by detectors (10, 19, 25) and converted into electric signals which are supplied to a device (12) for establishing the apparent density profile.
