<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rearview mirror mounted on 
a motor vehicle, and especially to a device for adjusting the 
mirror angle for rearview mirrors in which the mirror angles 
can be changed rapidly to see and confirm around the rear 
wheel when the vehicle is driven backward, e.g. when parking 
the vehicle near the pavement edge. Many conventional rearview mirrors are used for vehicles, and 
the mirror angle can be adjusted in a vertical and a 
horizontal direction by an electrically driven remote-control 
operation. This kind of rearview mirrors has a mirror holder 
with a mirror in a mirror body and an actuator unit for 
adjusting the angle of reflection. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,693,571 and 4,696,555 disclose 
an actuator unit including a first reversible motor and a 
drive transmission for adjusting the mirror reflection angle 
in a vertical direction, and including a second reversible 
motor and a drive transmission for adjusting the mirror  
 
reflection angle in a horizontal direction. The actuator 
housing has a central pivot to support the mirror tiltingly, 
movable pivots for adjusting the vertical and the horizontal 
reflection angle of the mirror are projected from the actuator 
housing which are provided at positions apart from the 
central pivot in an orthogonal direction equidistantly, and 
these pivots are enganged in pivot sockets of a rear surface 
of the mirror holder. By an actuation of the first or the 
second motor, a screw is rotated and the movable pivot 
provided with an adjust nut is moved to adjust the vertical 
or the horizontal reflection angle of the mirror. In conventional rearview mirrors, the rear wheels side of the 
vehicle can not be seen since the mirror is normally set at 
its angle to see and observe the next vehicle following 
thereafter. For example, when the vehicle is driven back to 
approach the street side, it is preferred to change the 
reflection angle of the mirror widely and downwardly to 
enable the back sight of the area around the rear wheel which 
is opposite to the driver's seat. However, it takes a time to 
change the angle, and burdens the driver. To overcome the foregoing problems, as disclosed by Japanese 
Utility Model Application Publication No. Hei 4-125944, the 
inventor invented a mirror angle adjusting device (apparatus) 
for an electric rearview mirror of a vehicle, in which a 
means for rapidly changing the angle of the mirror is 
contained in the actuator unit to push out and back a movable 
pivot only with a determined
