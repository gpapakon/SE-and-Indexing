<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic resonance imaging apparatus using NMR 
phenomenon includes a main magnet, a first to a third 

gradient field coils, a RF coil, a gradient field 
controller, a RF controller and a data processor. The 

main magnet generates a uniform static magnetic field 
in a imaging space. The first to third gradient field 

coils for generating three gradient field pulses with 
magnetic strength varying in three orthogonal directions 

in the imaging space. The RF coil for transmits 
a RF signal and detects an NMR signal. The gradient 

field controller causes the first gradient field coil 
to generate a slice-selecting gradient field pulse 

the second gradient field coil 
to generate a phase-encoding gradient field pulse, 

causes the third gradient field coil to generate a 
reading gradient field pulse 

the RF controller causes the 
RF coil to transmit the RF signal and to apply a RF 

signal (MTC pulse) having a frequency slightly offset 
from a resonance frequency of free water protons.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnetic resonance
imaging apparatus using NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance).Magnetic resonance imaging apparatus, by utilizing
the resonance of atomic nuclei, visualize biological
tissues based on spin relaxation time differences
thereof. Such apparatus are extremely useful in
morphological diagnosis in the medical field since they
realize images of excellent contrast reflecting the
relaxation time differences. Generally, NMR parameters
used include proton density p and two types of relaxation
time. The latter are longitudinal relaxation time
(also called spin-lattice relaxation time) T1 and
transverse relaxation time (also called spin-spin
relaxation time) T2.A contrast improving technique for the magnetic
resonance imaging apparatus which relies on MT (magnetization
transfer) effect has become known in recent
years (see, for example, S. P. Wolf and R. S. Balaban,
Mag. Reson. Med. vol. 10, p135, 1989; B. S. Hu et al., 
Mag. Reson. Med. vol. 26, p231, 1992; and Japanese
Patent Publication (Unexamined) No. 3-173529). This
technique acquires image contrast based on an interaction
between protons of free water in biological
tissue, and protons of macromolecules such as membranes
and proteins and protons of water surrounding them in a
movement-restricted manner (hereinafter called restricted
water). The image contrast resulting from
magnitude of MT is called MTC (magnetization transfer
contrast). This MT effect is expected to benefit
medical diagnosis not only with improved image contrast
but by reflecting tissue properties.Conventionally, this MTC image is acquired by a
method which applies presaturation pulses having a
frequency band slightly offset (i.e. having a frequency
offset) from the resonance frequency of free water, or
presaturation pulses called binomial pulses and having
a special shape (these pulses being collectively called
MTC pulses herein), to an imaging sequence of the
gradient echo or spin echo technique. The binomial
pulse is a pulse of special form having a zigzag-shaped
frequency spectrum not including the resonance frequency
of free water but including a frequency at which the
protons of restricted water resonate (Hore, P. J.,
1983, A new method for water suppression in the proton 
NMR spectra of aqueous solutions, J. Magn. Resonance,
54, 539-542).The protons of restricted water, which rapidly
relax transversely (e.g. in transverse relaxation time
T2 not exceeding 0.5msec) and which cannot be visualized
by an ordinary method, can be caused to resonate
partial
