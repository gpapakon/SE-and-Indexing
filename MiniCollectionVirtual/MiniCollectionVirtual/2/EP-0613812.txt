<ABSTRACT>
Running gear for a rail vehicle is proposed, having at least two wheel sets which are radially adjustable by means of compensation levers (19, 19', 33, 33', 48). The rotational movement of at least one compensation lever (19, 19', 33, 33', 48) can be influenced by an externally actuated control cylinder (26, 26', 38, 38', 52) so that the influence, which interferes with the radial control, of the horizontal restoring forces of the wheel set springs is compensated.

<CLAIMS>
Running gear for a rail vehicle with at least two 
wheel sets, which can be adjusted radially by means of 

compensating levers (19, 19', 33, 33', 48), the adjustment 
of the wheel sets being accomplished by means of the 

longitudinal forces which occur at the stand-up points of 
the wheels during cornering, characterized in that the 

rotary motion of at least one compensating lever (19, 
19', 33, 33', 48) can be influenced by an activated 

control cylinder (26, 26', 38, 38', 52), the activation 
of the control cylinder within the framework of the 

running gear being such that the control force exerted 
during cornering serves exclusively to overcome the 

horizontal restoring forces of the wheel set springs (6, 
11), while the pivoting movement is effected purely by 

the radial control. 
Running gear according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the control cylinder (26, 26', 38, 38', 52) is 

connected to the boggy frame (2) by way of its first 
joint (27, 40, 53) and to the compensating lever (19, 

19', 33, 33', 48) by way of its second joint (29, 29', 
39, 39', 51). 
Running gear according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the second joint (29, 29', 39, 39', 51) is 

connected to the compensating lever (19, 19', 33, 33', 
48) by way of a turning lever (30, 30', 37, 37', 50). 
Running gear according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the compensating levers on the 

right-hand and left-hand side of the boggy are coupled to 
one another by way of a turning shaft (41), and a dedicated 

control cylinder (26, 38) is provided on each side 
of the boggy. 
Running gear according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the compensating levers on the 

right-hand and left-hand side of the boggy are coupled to 
one another by way of a turning shaft (41), and a control 

cylinder (26) is provided on only one side of the boggy. 
Running gear according to one of Claims 1 to 5,  
 

characterized in that the control cylinders for the 
compensating levers on the right-hand and left-hand side 

of the boggy are arranged so as to act in opposite 
senses. 
Running gear according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the control cylinders for the 

compensating levers on the right-hand and left-hand side 
of the boggy are activated in opposite senses.
