Bale-carrying device (2) designed as an attachment for a 
vehicle, in particular for a fork-lift truck (1), comprising 

a mounting frame (4) which can be attached to the 
vehicle, a lifting device (5) capable of moving up and down 

on the mounting frame, and two retaining arms (6,7) provided 
on the lifting device (5), which essentially extend 

forwards from the lifting device in the direction of travel, 
are fitted with opposing bearing surfaces (8,9) arranged 

roughly vertically and parallel to each other, and are 
mounted on the lifting device (5) in such a manner as to be 

movable towards and away from each other in a lateral direction, 
relative to the direction of travel, 
characterised 
in that
 at least one of the two 
retaining arms (6) is provided with a cutting device (10) 

extending across almost the entire height of its bearing 
surface (8) in order to sever the binding wires (11) of the 

bales (3). 
Carrying device as per Claim 1, 
characterised 
in that
 the other retaining arm (7) displays a 
gripping device (25) extending across almost the entire 

height of its bearing surface (9) in order to hold the 
severed binding wires (11) firmly in place. 
Carrying device as per Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised 
in that
 the cutting device (10) is 
designed as a blade (12) with a full-length cutting edge, 

which can be retracted into the bearing surface (8) when 
inactive and moved forward out of the bearing surface in 

order to execute the cutting cycle.  
 
Carring device as per Claim 3, 
characterised 
in that
 the blade (12) can be moved in a straight 
line in the direction of pressure of its cutting edge. 
Carring device as per Claim 4, 
characterised 
in that
 the blade (12) is movable via a lever mechanism 
(14) which can be operated with the help of a pressure 

cylinder (15). 
Carrying device as per one of the Claims 3 to 5, 
characterised 
in that
 the blade (12) is 
mounted on a blade holder (13) in replaceable fashion. 
Carrying device as per one of the Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised 
in that
 the bearing surface 
(8) of the retaining arm (6) bearing the cutting device 

(10) has a horizontal cross-section designed in concave 
form and that the cutting ed
ge of the blade (12) is located 
roughly in the most deeply recessed region of the bearing 

surface (8). 
Carrying device as per Claim 7, 
characterised 
in that
 the concave bearing surface (8) of the 
retaining arm (6) bearing the cutting device (10) is designed 

as two vertical, plane plates (22,23) arranged at an 
angle, between which a vertical gap (24) is left free for 

the blade (12). 
Carrying device as per one of the Claims 2 to 8, 
characterised 
in that
 the retaining arm (7) 
provided with the gripping device (25) displays an essentially 

plane bearing surface (9). 
Carrying device as per one of the Claims 2 to 9, 
characterised 
in that
 the gripping device 
(25) consists of at least two rows of teeth (26,27) which 

can be moved relative to each other, where the teeth (28) 
of at least one of the rows of teeth (27) each display an 

undercut.  
 
Carrying device as per Claim 10, 
characterised 
in that
 the gripping device (25) comprises two rows 
of teeth (26), arranged at a distance from each other and 

fixed on the bearing surface (9) of the retaining arm (7), 
between which a further row of teeth (27) is provided and 

guided in longitudinally sliding fashion. 
Carrying device as per Claim 11, 
characterised 
in that
 the row of teeth (27) which can be guided 
in sliding fdashion is provided with the undercut teeth 

(28). 
Carrying device as per Claim 12, 
characterised 
in that
 the sides of the teeth (28) facing away 
from the undercuts are each provided with a bevel (29). 
Carrying device as per one of the Claims 11 to 13, 
characterised 
in that
 the row of teeth 
(27) guided in sliding fashion can be moved via a lever 

mechanism (30) operated with the help of a pressure cylinder 
(31). 
Carrying device as per one of the Claims 10 to 14, 
characterised 
in that
 a row of prongs (37) 
is provided on the bearing surface (9) of the retaining arm 

(7) fitted with the gripping device (25) at a distance from 
the rows of teeth and parallel to them. 
Carrying device as per one of the Claims 1 to 15, 
characterised 
in that
 the front sides of 
the retaining arms (6,7) are provided with a wedge-shaped, 

tapered area across their entire height.
