<ABSTRACT>
The aim of the present invention is to provide a 
crusher, which is capable of efficiently crushing 

materials or scraps, and a crushing mechanism for the 
crusher. The crusher disclosed comprises: a fixed member 

(30a) having a first blade portion (318,320) for crushing 
a material (50) to be crushed into pieces; a movable 

member (30b) being capable of moving to and away from the 
fixed member (30a); the movable member (30b) having a 

second blade portion (330,340), which crushes the 
material (50) into pieces with the first blade portion 

(318,320) when the movable member (30b) is moved toward 
the fixed member (30a); and a driving mechanism (20) for

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a crusher and a crushing
mechanism for the same, more precisely relates to a crusher,
which is capable of crushing scraps, e.g., resin runners
formed during plastic molding processes, rubber materials,
metals, so as to reuse them.Various types of crushers have been known, e.g., Japanese
Utility Model Publication Gazette No. 61-3461. One of conventional
crushers, which crushes plastic scraps, e.g., resin
runners, into pieces for a reuse, is shown in Figs. 16 and 17.
Fig. 16 is a side sectional view of the conventional plastic
crusher; Fig. 17 is a plan view thereof. In the conventional
plastic crusher, there are provided a plurality of blade
members 5 on a shaft 4 at regular intervals. A fixed member 7
has a plurality of blades 8, which are arranged like comb-teeth.
Each blade member 5 has a plurality of blade 6, which
are arranged in the circumferential direction of the blade
member 5 at regular intervals. The blades 6 of each blade
member 5 are capable of passing through a gap between the
blades 8 with the rotation of the shaft 4, so that materials
or plastic scraps can be crushed by them.Though there are various types of crushers, all of them
have the rotary blade members 5 for crushing materials or
scraps as an essential element.AT-B-389241 discloses a crusher having features set
forth in the precharacterising part of Claim 1. Such a
crusher has a single section for crushing material.However, the conventional crushers having the rotary
blade members have following disadvantages.
1 ○ It is difficult to make pieces crushed in a 
uniform size. Some materials can be passed through
gaps between the blades 6 and 8 without being crushed,
so that they are discharged with large sizes.2 ○ The blade members 5 must hold materials to crush
them. But the materials will be free from the blade
members 5 when the blade members 5 insufficiently hold
them, so that the crushing efficiency cannot be raised.3 ○ If crushing is continued without discharging
pieces crushed, the crusher is overheated by frictional
heat among the materials.4 ○ Some materials are not crushed by the blades 6,
and they stay between the blades 8.5 ○ If crushing is continued without discharging the
pieces crushed, minute resin particles are scattered
so that work environment will be worse.An aim of the present invention is to provide a
crusher, which is capable of efficiently crushing materials or
scraps, and a crushing mechanism for the crusher.The present invention provides, in a first of its
aspects, a crusher
