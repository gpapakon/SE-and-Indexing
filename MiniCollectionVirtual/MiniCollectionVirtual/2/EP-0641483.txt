<DESCRIPTION>
The technical field of this invention is cleaning apparatus for rinsing and 
drying carriers used to hold and process semiconductor wafers, substrates, flat 
panel displays and similar articles requiring extremely low contamination levels. The processing of semiconductor wafers and substrates is very sensitive to 
problems of contamination. This is also true with photomasks, flat panel 
displays, data disks, and other articles relating to the semiconductor industry. 
These articles require extremely low contamination levels. Even minute 
contaminants can cause defects to occur in the processing of these low-contamination 
wafer articles. Accordingly, it is necessary to maintain a high level 
of cleanliness during all or nearly all stages of production. Semiconductor wafers, substrates, photomasks, flat panel displays and other 
similar low-contamination wafer products are also typically processed in batches. 
Batch handling may occur throughout the entire production process, or for one 
or more processing steps or related handling operations. Batch processing of 
this type almost always utilizes some type of carrier or carriers to hold the thin 
wafer-like materials being processed. In the batch processing of semiconductor substrates and wafers, a wafer 
carrier is used to hold a group of these articles. The wafer carriers can be of 
various designs and are more specifically referred to as a wafer boat. In many 
applications the wafer boat is made of a suitable polymeric material, e.g. 
polypropylene or TEFLONÂ® fluoropolymer. The sides and sometimes the bottom 
of the wafer boat have receiving slots formed to receive and positionally restrain 
the wafers in a spaced array with the faces of the wafers adjacent one another. 
Typically, the central axes of the wafers are aligned. The wafers are slid into 
the boat, such as from the side or above and removed by sliding them 
outwardly. The receiving slots in the wafer boat are shallow so that the wafer 
is engaged only at the peripheral edges and along a thin marginal band 
extending inwardly from the periphery. Wafer carriers can also be provided in the form of a protective case or 
box in which the wafers are held and enclosed against contamination during  
 
travel within the processing facility. Wafer carriers of this type are frequently 
designed to hold a wafer boat having a complementary design. The complementary 
relationship of the protective wafer carrier box and the wafer carrier boat allow the 
boat and supported wafers to be fully enclosed and

<CLAIMS>
A centrifugal carrier cleaner for cleaning carriers used in semiconductor 
processing, comprising: 


a frame (22); 
a processing vessel (21) defining a process chamber therein, the processing vessel 
being supported on the frame; 
port means (34; 36) to allow installation and removal of carriers into or from the 
process chamber, the port means (34; 36) being formed in a sidewall of the processing 

vessel to allow side access for installation and removal of carriers; 
a door (33; 35) for controllably opening and closing the port means (34; 36); 
a rotor (70) mounted within the process chamber for rotation about a rotational 
axis, the rotor (70) extending within the process chamber in an upstanding orientation and 

having a hub, a rotor cage (71), and spokes (193) connecting the hub to the cage (71) with 
spaces between the spokes; 
a plurality of carrier supports (200) connected to the rotor (70) for holding carriers 
during centrifugal cleaning, the carrier supports being loadable from the side through the 

port means (34; 36); 
rotor drive means (150) for controllably rotating the rotor (70); 
a primary drying gas supply (65) for supplying drying gas to the process chamber 
and including: 
a drying gas plenum, 
a top drying gas port (65) which is provided in a top wall of the processing 
vessel providing communication between the plenum and the processing vessel, and 

which is approximately aligned with the rotational axis of the rotor (70), 
at last one drying gas filter (55) for filtering contaminants from drying gas 
supplied to the drying gas plenum, and 
at least one drying gas heater for heating drying gas supplied to the drying 
gas plenum; 
a plurality of inner liquid supply nozzles and a plurality of inner drying gas nozzles 
for directing cleaning liquid and secondary drying gas outwardly with respect to the rotor  

 
axis towards carriers held in the carrier supports (200); 
a plurality of outer liquid supply nozzles and a plurality of outer drying gas nozzles 
for directing cleaning liquid and secondary drying gas inwardly with respect to the rotor 

axis towards carriers held in the carrier supports (200); and 
exhaust means for exhausting drying gas and cleaning liquid from the process 
chamber, the exhaust means being located at the bottom of the processing vessel; 
the area of the top drying gas port (65) being much greater than that of each 
of the secondary drying gas nozzles whereby the rotary motion of the rotor (70) causes, 

by centrifugal action, filtered, heated drying gas to be supplied from the plenum to the 
process chamber through the primary drying gas supply top port (65) and downwardly 

through the said spaces between the rotor spokes, and further from the interior of the rotor 
cage outwardly towards the sidewall of the processing vessel without the need for a 

dedicated drying gas fan. 
A cleaner according to claim 1, characterised in that the rotor drive means (150) 
is mounted beneath the bottom of the processing vessel (21). 
A cleaner according to any preceding claim, characterised in that the carrier 
supports have detachable carrier support baskets. 
A cleaner according to any preceding claim, characterised in that the port means 
comprises entrance and exit ports which have associated entrance and exit doors, a
llowing 
carriers to be installed through the entrance port and removed through the exit port. 
A cleaner according to any preceding claim, characterised in that the door (33; 35) 
is slidably mounted on the frame.
