<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device formed on a semiconductor chip includes a 
signal processing unit composed of a plurality of signal processing cells 

arranged side by side in a horizontal direction, and a plurality of 
input/output cells each connected to a corresponding one of the signal 

processing cells in a one-to-one relation. The signal processing unit is 
located near to one corner of the semiconductor chip, and the input/output 

cells are uniformly distributed and located along two sides defining the 
above mentioned corner. Each of the signal processing cells is configured 

to make it possible that a wiring conductor connecting between the signal 
processing cell and a corresponding one of the input/output cells is taken 

out either in an upward vertical direction or in a downward vertical 
direction from the signal processing cell, in accordance with the side of 

the semiconductor chip along which the corresponding input/output cell is 
located.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a layout of a semiconductor device
such as a microprocessor, and more specifically to a floor plan of wirings
connecting between output pads or input/output pads and circuits for
generating or processing signals to or from these pads.Microprocessors of 32-bit machine include hardware (data path) for
generating address information of a 32-bit length and processing data of a
32-bit length. This data path is constituted by vertically arranging a
plurality of units for generating a 32-bit length address or processing a
32-bit length data. Each of the units is composed by arranging 32 layout
cells, called a leaf cell, each corresponding to one bit, in a horizontal
direction in the order of the bit number in accordance with a given rule.
The units within the data path are interconnected through a plurality of
buses having a 32-bit length, for exchange of data. These buses are
constituted of signal lines formed of metal wiring conductors. The leaf
cells of each unit are designed or laid out to the effect that, when the
plurality of units are arranged vertically, the wiring conductors of the
buses depict a straight line. On the other hand, the microprocessors of 32-bit machine include
32 address output cells and 32 data input/output cells. The address output
cells are provided for outputting address information of one bit to an
external of a microprocessor chip, and each of the address output cells is
constituted of a bonding pad, an output buffer, and a control circuit for
the output buffer. Similarly, each of the data input/output cells is
constituted of a bonding pad, an input/output buffer, and a control circuit
for the input/output buffer.The 32 address output cells and the 32 data input/output cells are
respectively connected to corresponding ones of the plurality of units
which constitute the data path, through a bundle of metal wiring
conductors. Namely, an external address generation unit, which
cooperates with other units for generating an external address
information, are connected to the address output cells through 32 metal
wiring conductors. A data generating and processing unit for generating
an output data and for processing an input data, are connected to the data
input/output cells through 32 metal wiring conductors.Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a conventional floor plan
illustrating an address output arrangement of the 32-bit microprocessor.
A microprocessor 300 is fabricated in accordance with a semiconductor
manufacturing process in which at least
