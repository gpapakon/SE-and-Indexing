<DESCRIPTION>
An embodiment useful to understand the invention relates to a method of
controlling an anti-lock brake system for vehicles which
prevents the locking of the wheels upon emergency braking
of a vehicle, said method being characterized in that it
uses the road surface friction force F or road surface
friction coefficient µ instead of slip factor used in the
prior art, so as to control the system.The present invention relates to a method of
finding a control point in an anti-lock brake system (ABS)
for vehicles which prevents the locking of the wheels upon
emergency braking of a vehicle according to claim 1. This method
makes an errorless ABS control
decision by using a road surface friction force detecting
sensor or a road surface friction coefficient detecting
sensor.Generally, conventional anti-lock brake systems for 
vehicles, e.g., automobiles, automatically control the
brake operation such that the slip ratio falls in a given
range on the basis of the vehicle speed and wheel speed
(e.g., Japanese Patent Publication No. 30585/1984 and
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Specification No.
61354/1985). The relation between road surface friction
coefficient and slip ratio can vary depending on the road
surface conditions and for this reason said systems
sometimes fail to provide a maximum brake pressure, in
which case a minimum brake distance cannot be obtained.
Further, since the vehicle speed is a value estimated from
the wheel speed, there is a problem on precision in the
control of slip ratio. To accurately know the vehicle
speed, there is a need for a complicated device, such as a
ground-relative speed sensor (e.g., Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open Specification No. 64861/1988) or a
vehicle deceleration sensor (e.g., Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open Specification No. 170157/1988). In
the device described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
Specification No. 25169/1988, the torque of road
surface friction force (tire torque) acting on the wheel is
found by calculation from wheel angular acceleration and
brake liquid pressure and that value of the tire torque at
which the tire torque starts to decrease during the
increase of the brake liquid pressure is employed as one of
the factors for deciding the conditions immediately before
the locking of the wheel. However, in this device, the 
tire torque is indirectly found by calculation from the
wheel angular acceleration and brake liquid pressure and on
account of the presence of uncertain constants such as
brake efficiency and the moment

A method of detecting the control point, i.e. the point where the brake pressure
is shifted from a pressure increasing mode to a pressure retaining or decreasing

mode, upon emergency breaking of a vehicle having an ABS which comprises a
stress sensor (1, 2 in Fig. 14) providing an output proportional to the road surface

friction force F or road surface friction coefficient µ having mixed therein a crosstalk
component, such as brake torque T, and proportional to the brake torque T,


characterised by

   making an adjustment from the rise of the brake start such that detected
signals of F or µ and T are adjusted in ratio or made equal in value, and

   deciding the control point by a change in said ratio or in adjustment coefficient,
wherein the timing of the control point is detected by the size of a change in

the ratio of detected signals of F or µ and T or in the adjustment coefficient.
The method of claim 1 wherein the point of time, when said ratio or the
adjustment coefficient substantially stops changing is decided to be the control

timing.
The method of claim 1 wherein the point of time,

   when said ratio or the adjustment coefficient, during brake pressure decreasing
control, becomes substantially equal to the value obtained upon completion of

the preceding brake pressure decreasing control, or,

   when said ratio or the adjustment coefficient during the brake pressure decreasing
control becomes greater than the value obtained during the first brake

pressure decreasing control, or,
 
   when said ratio or the adjustment coefficient during the brake pressure decreasing

control starts to increase,

   is decided to be the completion of the brake pressure decreasing control and
the optimum control timing for the ABS.
The method of claim 1 wherein the point of time,

   when said ratio or the adjustment coefficient, except during the brake pressure
decreasing control, becomes just above the value obtained during the first

brake pressure decreasing control, or,

   when said ratio or the adjustment coefficient during the brake pressure retaining
control becomes smaller than the value obtained during the first brake pressure

decreasing control and becomes further smaller,

control timing for the ABS.
The method of claim 1 wherein the point of time, when said ratio or the
adjustment coefficient during the brake pressure retaining control becomes greater

than the value obtained during the first brake pressure decreasing control, is decided
to be the start of brake pressurisation control and the optimum control timing

for the ABS.
The method of claim 1 wherein the point of time, when said ratio or the
adjustment coefficient during the brake pressure retaining control becomes smaller

than the value obtained during the first brake pressure decreasing control and is
stabilised, is decided to be continuation of brake pressure retention or the start of

control of gentle increase of pressure and the optimum control timing for the ABS. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the timing for the control point is detected
by a change in the F - T value after its adjustment or during brake control.
The method of claim 1, wherein a threshold value for the F - T value is
provided to decide the control point.
The method of claim 8, wherein said threshold value is corrected as the road
surface friction coefficient changes, thereby detecting the timing for the control

point.
