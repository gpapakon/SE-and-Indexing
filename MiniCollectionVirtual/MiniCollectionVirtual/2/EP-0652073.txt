<ABSTRACT>
A chucking-type parts-feeding apparatus (5) comprises a device for chucking 
an individual part (3), which is disposed adjacent an end of a parts-feeding 

passageway (4), and a device connected with the chucking device (5) for 
shifting the individual part (3) held in the chucking device (5) towards a 

predetermined location apart from the parts-feeding passageway (4). The 
apparatus further comprises either a device connected with the chucking 

device for shifting the individual part (3) held in the chucking device in 
the direction in which the part comes out of the parts-feeding passageway 

or an opening formed in the parts-feeding passageway for allowing the part 
to pass through the opening as the chucking device (5) is moved towards the 

predetermined location.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chucking-type parts-feeding
apparatus which delivers individual parts to a chucking device held on
standby mode for holding each part before eventually feeding these parts to
an objective position.A variety of parts-feeding systems exist for delivering designated parts
to an objective location by operating a chucking device for grasping them.Generally, the prior art allows a chucking device to gain access to
designated parts, or alternatively causes those parts to be delivered to the
chucking device. This presents the problem of requiring precise determination
of the relative positions of the delivered parts and the chucking device.Furthermore, the prior art also encounters problems due to the inclined
orientation of the parts when received by the chucking device, making it difficult
for the chucking device to correctly chuck the parts.The Applicant's Japanese patent application JP-A-04 122 531 teaches
a parts coupling device where a part is transferred from a parts supply to a
parts receiving member by a combination of two drive means, the first having
a chucking device (preamble of claim 1).The Applicant's Japanese patent application JP-A-04 093 192
discloses a parts feeding device with a single drive means for transferring the
parts, and an outlet port (preamble of claim 2). Therefore, the invention as claimed in claims 1 and 2 fully
solves those technical problems incidental to conventional
parts feeding systems. The part-feeder
according to Claim 1 of the invention provides
a parts-chucking device at a predetermined position
corresponding to an end of a parts-feeding passageway,
wherein a first drive means is provided in combination with
the chucking device in order to shift individual parts held
in the chucking device in the direction to get out of the
parts-feeding passageway, and in addition, a second drive
means is also provided in order to shift individual parts
in the direction apart from the parts-feeding passageway.
Concretely, each part arrived at an end of the parts-feeding
passageway enters into the chucking device, where the chucked
part is pushed out of the passageway by the first drive means,
and then the extruded part is pushed farther from the passageway
by the second drive means, and finally, the extruded
part is transferred to an objective location as of the
chucked condition.A parts-chucking device
is disposed at a predetermined position corresponding to
an end of the parts-feeding passageway, and therefore, an
individual part arrived at an end

<CLAIMS>
A part-feeder comprising;

a chuck (5) for a part (3),
a feed passage (4),
for delivering parts to the chuck;
a receptacle (38)
to receive a part delivered by the chuck;
the chuck having a reference position in relation to
a delivery end of the feed passage;
a first drive (21) combined with said chuck for shifting,
in a first direction, a part held in the chuck,

to separate the part from the feed passage; and
a second drive (24) for shifting,
in a second direction, a part held in the chuck,

away from the feed passage and
towards the receptacle;

characterised by
an air jetting port (34) mounted upon and

transferable with the chuck,

past the receptacle (38)
to displace impurities therefrom,

preparatory to part insertion.
A part-feeder comprising;

a chuck (5) for a part (3),
a feed passage (4),
for delivering parts to the chuck;
a receptacle (38)
to receive a part delivered by the chuck;
the chuck having a reference position in relation to
a delivery end of the feed passage;
a single drive for shifting
a part held in the chuck

away from the feed passage and
towards the receptacle; and
an outlet port formed in the feed passage
for permitting the part to be removed;

characterised by
an air jetting port (34) mounted upon and

transferable with the chuck,
past the receptacle (38)

to displace impurities therefrom,
preparatory to part insertion.
A part-feeder,

as claimed in either of the preceding claims,

the end of the feed passage
allowing partial protrusion of the part.
A part-feeder,

as claimed in any of the preceding claims,

further comprising an extendable detection rod (42)
for confirming presence of a part

in the chuck
and simultaneously thrusting the part into the chuck.
A part-feeder,

as claimed in any of the preceding claims,

further comprising a sensor secured to part of the chuck
to confirm presence of a part

in the chuck.
A part-feeder,

as claimed in any of the preceding claims,

wherein the feed passage is obliquely or vertically disposed;
with a holding means formed in the chuck

to prevent displacement of the part
as a result of inclined posture

of the feed passage.
A part-feeder,

as claimed in Claim 6,

wherein the holding means comprises a projection (50).
A part-feeder,

as claimed in Claim 6,

wherein the holding means comprises a magnet (52).
