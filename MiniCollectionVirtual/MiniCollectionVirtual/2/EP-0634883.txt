<ABSTRACT>
A sports lighting fixture having a broken glass detection 
arrangement includes a high intensity light source disposed near the 

closed end of a reflector member. A cover member made of a light 
transmissive material is disposed at the open end of the reflector and is 

effective for filtering UV radiation emitted by the light source. A ballast 
circuit has in input portion receptive of line power and an output portion 

effective for conditioning the line power to energize the light source. A 
conductor strip is disposed on the cover member and is effective such 

that, when the cover member is intact, an electrical signal can be passed 
therethrough. An interruption circuit arrangement is electrically coupled 

into the ballast circuit and has the conductive strip disposed therein so 
that, upon the occurrence of an open condition in the conductive strip, 

indicative of a broken glass condition, the interruption circuit arrangement 
is effective for interrupting current flow in the ballast circuit thereby 

resulting in a shutdown of power to the light source and the consequent 
prevention of further UV emission until such time as the cover member is 

replaced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sports lighting luminaire having a broken 
glass safety shutdown circuit. More particularly, this invention relates to 
such a sports lighting luminaire which exhibits improved photometric 
performance using an arc tube in a parabolic reflector, the luminaire 
having a tempered glass cover to provide filtering of ultraviolet radiation 
(UV) and wherein a safe and cost efficient circuit is provided to insure that 
upon breakage of the cover, the light source is shut down so as to 
substantially prevent the emission of UV. Architectural lighting designers, faced with the task of uniformly and 
efficiently illuminating the playing surface of a sports field while minimizing 
the amount of light spilled into the seating portion of the sports field, have 
utilized individual lighting fixtures that would be of a type that utilized a 
large light source having an arc tube disposed within an outer envelope 
that was oriented along the central axis of the light source. The light 
output pattern of such a fixture would be of a circular shape such that, 
once directed onto the playing surface of a sports field, resulted in an 
essentially elliptically shaped light pattern with varying amounts of light 
intensity around such elliptical shape. This approach suffers in terms of 
light utilization and the amount of spill light experienced; that is, the 
amount of light that goes beyond the playing surface and into the eyes 
of the spectators and in worst cases, beyond the confines of the sports 
field to surrounding homes and businesses. Because this fixture utilized  
 
a light source along the central axis of the reflector with little regard for 
the amount of light exiting the fixtures at high angles thereby resulting in 
such spill light, the size constraint of an outer jacket to the light source 
was not of critical consideration and such outer jacket could be utilized 
for the purpose of UV filtering from the arc tube disposed within the outer 
jacket. Although this approach has proven effective in providing a means 
of filtering UV radiation emitted by the high intensity light source, the 
consequences of such an approach in terms of light utilization and spill 
light has had adverse effects. For instance, since the elliptical light 
pattern results in an inefficient combination of patterns at the playing field 
surface, there is the need to increase the actual number of fixtures 
needed to illuminate a particular area and the need to provide external 
light directing devices such as
