<ABSTRACT>
Lithiated manganese oxides are synthesized using 
a novel two stage process. Using appropriate starting materials, 

lithiation is accomplished via low temperature ion 
exchange in aqueous warm salt solution. A heating stage 

follows which completes the synthesis. Materials suitable 
for use as cathodes in lithium ion rechargeable batteries 

have been prepared in this way. Novel materials might also 
be prepared using a similar low temperature ion exchange 

process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to solid solution oxides,
especially lithiated manganese oxides, processes for
synthesizing these materials, and their use as active
electrode materials in electrochemical cells. In particular,
the invention relates to the synthesis of such materials
for use as cathodes in lithium ion rechargeable
batteries.Lithium batteries are becoming increasingly
popular in the market place as they offer advantages of
high voltage and energy density over conventional aqueous
technologies. Recent developments in the field are allowing
lithium battery technologies to meet the demands of
ever greater energy density requirements for electronics
applications.Primary lithium batteries and historically
secondary lithium batteries have used metallic lithium or
a lithium alloy for the anode and often a transition metal
chalcogenide for the corresponding cathode. The discharge
process of batteries constructed in this way involves the
transfer of lithium atoms from the anode into the host
cathode. Thus, primary cells preferably have minimal
lithium in the cathode as fabricated in order to obtain
maximum capacity on discharge. Certain advantages however
can be obtained by partially lithiating the cathode prior
to battery fabrication. Common commercial cathode materials
include manganese oxide compounds. As taught in
the Hitachi Maxell KK, Japanese patent publication 59-31182
(1984), discharge performance and shelf stability of
a non-aqueous Li|MnO2 primary cell can be improved by
partial lithiation of the MnO2 cathode followed by appropriate 
heat treatment. This was accomplished by soaking the
MnO2 in LiOH solution and then heat treating preferably
around 300°C. The MnO2 contains significant amounts of
bound water which is driven off by heating. In this
publication, it is stated that the presence of lithium in
the host MnO2 prevents undesirable changes on heating.The prior art contains other references teaching
similar ways of lithiating manganese oxides for use in
batteries. Sanyo, Japanese Kokai 62-108455 (1987) disclose
a secondary battery employing a cathode of lithium doped
gamma phase electrolytic manganese dioxide made in the same
general way described in the Hitachi '182 publication.
Toshiba, Japanese Kokai 62-126556 (1987) describe batteries
made with cathode material prepared from LiOH treated MnO2.
Moli, U.S. patent 4,959,282, describe the preparation of
what was called "X-phase" cathode material for batteries
where the lithiated manganese oxide is first coated with
LiOH solid via evaporation
