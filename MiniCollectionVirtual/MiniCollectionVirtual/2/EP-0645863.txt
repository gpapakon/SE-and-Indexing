<ABSTRACT>
Three-phase electric-power line comprising a gastight steel tubular casing filled with pressurised insulating gas, such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide CO2, inside which are place three busbars, a thin aluminium tubular casing (3) being arranged between the steel casing (2) and the busbars (1A, 1B, 1C), characterised in that the busbars (1A, 1B, 1C) are held in place by clamps (4) made of non-magnetic material, having an external diameter equal to the internal diameter of the aluminium tubular casing (3) and possessing three radial arms(4A, 4B, 4C) onto which are screwed the fasteners (7, 8) for the insulating supports (6) gripping the busbars.

<CLAIMS>
A three-phase electrical power line comprising a sealed tubular 
envelope (2) of steel filled with insulating gas under pressure, e.g. 

nitrogen or carbon dioxide CO
2
, and having three conductive bars (1A, 
1B, 1C) placed therein, the line being characterized in that a thin 

tubular envelope (3) of aluminum is located between the steel 
envelope (2) and the bars (1A, 1B, 1C), and in that the conductive 

bars (1A, 1B, 1C) are held by collars (4) made of non-magnetic 
material, having an outside diameter equal to the inside diameter of 

the aluminum tubular envelope (3), and possessing three radial arms 
(4A, 4B, 4C) which are screwed to tabs (7, 8) of insulating supports 

(6) that enclose the conductive bars. 
An electricity line according to claim 1, characterized in that in 
register with the arms (4A, 4B, 4C), the collars (4) possess pairs of 

lugs (10A-11A, 10B-11B, 10C-11C) for receiving wheels (12A, 12B, 12C) 
that run on the inside surface of the steel envelope (2), the 

aluminum envelope having slots for receiving the wheels. 
An electricity line according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the arms (4A, 4B, 4C) of the collars (4) are placed on flats (13A, 

13B, 13C) of the collars.
