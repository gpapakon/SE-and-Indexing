<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides methods and kits relating to identification of ductal orificies on a mammalian breast nipple. The methods employ technology to measure characteristic electrical signals on a nipple surface to locate and image or map the ductal orifices on the nipple surface. Kits are also provided comprising materials for identifying a duct by characteristic electrical signal, for additionally analyzing (30) the signals, and accessing or marking the ducts once they have been identified by the characteristic electrical signal values.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of this invention is use of a characteristic electrical signal to identify the location of milk duct orifices on mammalian breast nipples for purposes including accessing one or more of the milk ducts.Analysis of ductal secretions from human breasts has been used to diagnose biological conditions of the breast ducts (1-4; see list of references hereinafter). The human nipple has from 6 to 12 ducts, and most of these studies pooled secretions or nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) for the analysis. Thus, the secretions of an individual duct are not identified in these studies. More recently, breast duct access has been incorporated into ductal fluid analyses and study protocols (5-7). Various methods have been employed in order to identify the breast ducts for purposes including duct fluid analysis (8-15). Additionally, breast ducts have been accessed by ductscope (15,16). Ductalcannulation is proposed for delivery of agents (WO 97/05898 and (20)). Ductography, or mammary duct contrast examination, involves cannulation and injection of a ductal orifice (17-19), a process that is generally painless and devoid of complications (20). Ductal access is also required for performing lavage procedures on a milk duct to deliver an agent and/or to retrieve cells from the duct for analysis as described inco-pending and co-owned or licensed applications including U.S. Patent No. 6,221,622, U.S. Patent No. 6,494,859, WO 99/55384, U.S. Patent Application US 2006095017, WO 00/43553, WO 00/39557 and WO 00/70349. The challenge for the procedure can be finding a duct, or multiple ducts, for access.It would therefore be desirable to provide improved methods, devices, and kits for accessing breast ducts. More particularly, it would be desirable to provide for the improved detection and identification of individual ductal orifices to facilitate subsequent ductal access for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes. Such methods, devices, and kits should be convenient and relatively simple to use, should present the patient with minimal or no discomfort, and should be highly reliable, i.e., should be able to detect all individual ductal orifices in a nipple in all or most cases.WO 96/12439 assigned to TransScan Research & Development Corporation describes electrical impedance imaging devices having multi-element probes for providing electrical connection to tissue surfaces, particularly for detection of cancer in a live tissue, including breast tissue. U.S. Patent No. 5,810,742 assigned also to TransScan describes an apparatus

A method of identifying a ductal orifice (0) on a nipple (N) of a mammalian breast, said method comprising:

engaging a reference electrode (20) against a surface on the body of the mammal;
engaging a test electrode (12) to a test location on a nipple surface;
applying an electrical current and/or potential between the reference electrode (20) and the test electrode (12);
measuring a characteristic electrical signal produced in response to the applied electrical current and/or potential; and
comparing the measured value to a base value in order to determine a likelihood that the test location on the nipple surface comprises a ductal orifice (O).
