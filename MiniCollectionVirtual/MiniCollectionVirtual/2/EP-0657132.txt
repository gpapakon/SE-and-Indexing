<ABSTRACT>
- Grilling devices. - The invention relates to a grilling device comprising a plastic frame, at least one removable cooking plate (30), at least one heating element, at least one thermal reflector (20) for reflecting the infrared radiation onto the cooking plate (30) and a thermal sensor for regulating the temperature. - The invention employs a metal vessel (10) mounted on the frame in such a way as on the one hand to support the thermal reflector (20), the cooking plate (30) and the heating element and on the other to form, with the thermal reflector (20) and the frame, a casing in which the thermal reflector (20) extends across the inner volume defined by the vessel (10), which latter acts as a supplementary thermal reflector fixed to the frame and establishing point contacts with the cooking plate (30) and with the thermal reflector (20). - For a meat grilling device.

A grilling or cooking appliance including a supporting structure
made of plastics material, at least one removable cooking plate (30)

on which the item to be grilled is placed, at least one heater
element, at least one heat reflector (20) for reflecting towards the

cooking plate (30) the infrared radiation that is emitted by the
heater element, and a temperature sensor designed to regulate the

temperature of said appliance,

   the appliance being characterized in that a metal vessel (10)
is fitted on the supporting structure, firstly to support the heat

reflector (20), the cooking plate (30) and the heater element, and
secondly to co-operate with the heat reflector (20) and the

supporting structure to form an interlocking engagement in which the
heat reflector (20) extends into the internal space defined by the

vessel (10), which vessel forms an additional heat reflector that is
fixed on the supporting structure using temperature-resistant means

(6) and by establishing localized mechanical contacts with the
cooking plate (30) and with the heat reflector (20) respectively by

means of flexible connection parts (11) and fixing means of the
male/female type.
An appliance according to claim 1, characterized in that the
flexible connection parts (11) are fixed to and distributed around

the periphery of the vessel (10) to provide stable mechanical fixing
of the cooking plate (30) on the vessel (10).
An appliance according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
fixing means of the male/female type are constituted by projections

(21) that are distributed around the outside periphery of the heat
reflector (20) and by indentations (15) that are formed in the vessel

(10) to receive the projections (21) when the heat reflector (20) is
put in place on the vessel (10).
An appliance according to any preceding claim, characterized in
that, by construction of said appliance, the cooking plate (30) is

inclined relative to the horizontal in order to evacuate the juices
produced during cooking. 
An appliance according to any preceding claim, characterized in
that, for infrared radiation, the material constituting the heat

reflector (20) presents emissivity that is lower or equal to the
emissivity of the material constituting the vessel (10).
An appliance according to any preceding claim, characterized in
that the heat reflector (20) is constituted by an assembly comprising

a steel sheet sandwiched between two aluminum sheets.
An appliance according to any preceding claim, characterized in
that the heat reflector (20) is made of aluminum and is of thickness

not greater than 0.6 mm.
An appliance according to any preceding claim, characterized in
that the cooking plates (30, 31) are made of aluminum and are of

thickness not greater than 2.5 mm.
An appliance according to any preceding claim, characterized in
that each heater element is constituted by a refractory tube on which

or in which a resistance filament is provided, said heater elements
being supported by the vessel (10).
An appliance according to any preceding claim, characterized in
that the cooking plates (30. 31) are covered on the surfaces facing

the heater elements with a layer of material having high-emmisivity
with regard to the heat radiation emitted by said heater elements.
An appliance according to any preceding claim, characterized in
that it constitutes a meat grill.
