<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus in question was produced to enable the "sistemista" (the Totocalcio player) to monitor 
in real time the score predicted by his own forecast. As it can be seen by the following description, 

such appliance consists of a programmed electronic device. 
Its working is based on digital elaboration of the data inserted by the user through a keyboard. A 
liquid crystal display (lcd) permits to monitor in real time all the scores during a complete football 

day, divided game per game according to the "Totocalcio" football match calendars. 
Setting hypothetical predictions, by systems with a maximum of three variables for each prediction, 
this device is able to give the user the whole and the single favourable events, distributed among the 

several systems, predicted by the forecast itself. 
 
Furthermore, through more powerful elaboration data devices, it is possible to solve a considerable 
number of statistical, data elaboration and data memorization functions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The apparatus in question was produced to enable the "sistemista" (the 
Totocalcio player) to monitor in real time the score predicted by his own 
forecast. As it can be seen by the following description, such appliance 
consists of a programmed electronic device. Its working is based on digital elaboration of the data inserted by the user 
through a keyboard. A liquid crystal display (lcd) permits to monitor in real 
time all the scores during a complete football day, divided game per game 
according to the "Totocalcio" football match calendars. Setting hypothetical predictions, by systems with a maximum of three 
variables for each prediction, this device is able to give the user the whole 
and the single favourable events, distributed among the several systems, 
predicted by the forecast itself. Furthermore, through more powerful elaboration data devices, it is possible 
to solve a considerable number of statistical, data elaboration and data 
memorization functions. to make it more easily comprehensible, this description has been divided in 
three parts, corresponding to the single electronic circuit diagrams. The diagrams are divided as follows: 
1) keyboard 2) Control logic  3) Power supply The keyboard is composed of thirty-two function and entry keys, plus a 
thirty-third one to turn on/off the apparatus. All the keys, except the last one, are linked together by a matrix organized 
in four columns and eight rows.
 
they, so linked, can be easily located by a dedicated circuitry described 
hereunder. The device control logic is based on an integrated MPU circuit (Micro 
Processor Unit); its task is to perform, by a means of a program, determined 
functions according to the key digitized by the user. The main characteristics of this integrated circuit are the following: 
- system architecture:8 bit - clock frequency:8 MHz - supply voltage:3-6 V - program ROM memory (Read Only Memory):1828 bytes - data ROM memory:64 bytes - data RAM memory (Random Access Memory):64 bytes - user programmable I/O:20 - not maskable interrupt:1 Every time the user presses a key, the integrated U2 circuit dedicated to the 
matrix keyboard decodification, will inform, via a specific signal (Data 
Available), the MPU that, on the data pins of the decodification itself, a 
binary code, corresponding to the key digitized, is present. The 
identification of this particular event by the MPU takes place by means of a 
dedicated input pin (NMI) which, for each falling edge of the signal 
applied, sets the MPU in a particular

a) a program which memorises, associates, processes and displays the data 
inserted by the user in many times. The program, as far as associative functions 

are concerned, is specifically dedicated to the data distributive logic configured by 
the adopted graphic "mask". 

In its first part such mask reproduces the associative numeric sequence of the 
football teams, as it was presented in the weekly calendar of "Totocalcio" game. 

In a second part the partial and then final scores of the corresponding matches are 
reproduced, employing the symbols commonly used to indicate the match result 

(1,2,X). In the third part the predictions introduced by the user referring to the 
single day are reported, up to a maximum of four hypothetical issues. Besides, the 

favourable data of the comparison between scores and predictions are displayed 
in real time. In the fourth and last part the favourable events sum (1 to 13) 

relating to the systems is indicated; 
b) an electronic device consisting of a 33 function keys keyboard, an LCD display 
(interface machine-user) and an electronic control and management electronic 

board based on a component part working with programmable digital logic 
according to a). From a functional point of view, every element of this device is 

strictly necessary to the mask displaying and to the data input according to the 
distributive logic of the same.
