<ABSTRACT>
Jewellery comprising a first element (1) consisting of a slit ring (2) with ends which contact each other when at rest, as well as a second element (3) consisting of a U-shaped portion (4) with a bridge (5) linking its two arms. The resulting assembly forms a loop which may be frictionally passed through the ring (1) once the bridge (5) has been forced through the slit (2). A variously convertible item of jewellery may be obtained by providing a number of rings (1) and two or more different decorative elements (3) and combining them in different ways.
