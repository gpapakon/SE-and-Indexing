<ABSTRACT>
A centrifugal pump (10) for pumping biological fluids such as blood includes a housing (12) which defines a pumping chamber (36). The pumping chamber (36) encloses an impeller (14) mounted on a spindle (16). The impeller (14) carries coupling mechanisms which couple with an external source of rotation to rotate the impeller (14). The spindle (16) allows the impeller (14) to rotate freely, but both ends of the spindle (16) are constrained in the axial and lateral directions. The housing (12) includes an inlet (24) and an outlet (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pumps and more particularly to
centrifugal blood pumps without the requirement of a rotating seal to protect the
pump bearings from the pumped blood.Delicate surgical procedures require that the site of surgery
remain motionless during the surgical process. This made early heart surgery
difficult to impossible as interruption of the heart's pumping action for the
required length of time would be invariably fatal.During the 1960s, prolonged and non-fatal stoppage of the heart
became possible by use of newly developed "heart-lung" machines. These
machines consisted of a mechanical blood pump combined with a blood
oxygenator. They were capable of taking over the function of the natural heart
and lungs for periods of up to several hours, enabling the development of
techniques leading to today's extensive practice of open-heart surgery.The first practical mechanical blood pumps used were peristaltic
or "roller" pumps. The pumping action of a roller pump derives from the
compression of a section of the flexible plastic tubing which carries the blood
through the heart-lung machine. A moving roller presses the tubing against a
semicircular platen, moving the blood forward in the tubing. The speed of the
moving roller and the diameter of the tubing control the rate of blood flow.Although the roller pump was and is simple and reliable, it has
two characteristics which can endanger the patient undergoing surgery. First,
if flow is inadvertently obstructed, the pressure produced by a roller pump may
exceed the bursting strength of the tubing circuit. Second, if air is accidentally
introduced into the tubing circuit, it will be pumped to the patient along with the
blood. Either of these conditions may result in serious or fatal consequences to
the patient.In 1976, centrifugal blood pumps began to replace the roller 
pump as the "heart" of the heart-lung machine. The pumping action of a
centrifugal pump derives from the rotation of an impeller within a pumping
chamber. Pump pressure is controlled by the rotational speed of the impeller.
At operational speeds, excessive pressure cannot be produced. Additionally, the
centrifugal forces in the pump form a natural air trap and, with massive
introduction of air, deprime and discontinue pumping altogether. These two
safety features, and the lower blood damage caused by these pumps, is now
widely recognized, and has led to their extensive use for open heart surgery.In the early 1980s it was demonstrated that a mechanical blood
pump could be

<CLAIMS>
A centrifugal pump (10) for pumping biological fluids such as blood adapted to be
coupled with an external source of rotation (74), the pump comprising:


a housing (12) defining a pumping chamber (36) and including an inlet
(24) and an outlet (26),
a rotatable spindle (16) enclosed within the pumping chamber;
an impeller (14) supported on the spindle (16) and including coupling
means (70) for coupling the impeller (14) with the external source of rotation (72);
a first journal bearing (64A) for rotatably supporting and receiving one end
of the spindle (16); and
a second journal bearing (64B) for rotatably supporting and receiving the
other end of the spindle;
the pump being 
characterised in that
 the inner end surfaces of the journal
bearings (64A, 64B) are spaced apart by a distance which is greater than the length

of the spindle to define an axial clearance between the opposed surfaces of the
journal bearings and the spindle.
A centrifugal pump as claimed in claim 1 wherein the coupling means comprises
magnetic means (70) carried by the impeller (14) for magnetically coupling with

the external source of rotation (72).
A centrifugal pump as claimed claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the journal bearings
(64A, 64B) do not rotate with respect to the housing.
A centrifugal pump as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the inlet (24)
is tubular and is disposed externally of the pumping chamber (36) and wherein the

first journal bearing (64A) is supported from the inlet (24).
A centrifugal pump a claimed in claim 4 wherein the inlet (24) is curvilinear.
A centrifugal pump as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5 further comprising
means for counteracting a tendency of the impeller to move axially toward the inlet 

when rotating.
A centrifugal pump as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein the impeller
(14) carries blades (48) on a first side facing the inlet (24) and has a plurality of

grooves (63) on a second, opposite side.
A centrifugal pump as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein a lateral
clearance is provided between the ends of the spindle (16) and the opposed surfaces

of the journal bearings (64A, 64B).
A centrifugal pump as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the first
journal bearing (64A) is embedded in a wall of the inlet (24).
