<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a winding device for a web of fibrous material (1), having a carrier drum (2) which is wrapped around at least partially by the web of fibrous material (1), to which drum a carrying axle (3) for the web of fibrous material (1) can be fed and can be laid on the carrier drum surface (4) in a winding position (5) in an axially parallel fashion. The underlying object consists in developing a winding device of this type in such a manner that the risk of web breaks is reduced and the shrinkage and crease-formation of webs of fibrous material (1) are counteracted. This is achieved in that the web of fibrous material (1) is guided to the carrier drum (2), together with a guide belt (8), by a device (7) positioned upstream in the web running direction (6) and is transferred from the guide belt (8) onto the carrier drum (2).

Winding-up apparatus for a fibre material web (1) having a drier unit
positioned before it and the following features:


(a) the fibre material web (1) is at least partly wrapped around a
carrying drum (2);
(b) a carrier axle (3) for the fibre material web (1) can be supplied to
the carrier drum (2) and placed axially parallel on its carrier drum

jacket (4) in a winding position (5);
(c) a guide belt (8) is provided which leads the fibre material web (1)
from a preceding device (7) in the web running direction (6) and

transfers it to the carrier drum (2);
(d) the preceding device (7) is a drier unit for the fibre material web
and includes a drier screen;
(e) characterized in that the drier screen is used as the said guide belt
(8).
Winding-up apparatus in accordance with claim 1, characterized in
that the carrier drum (2) contains suction zones (9) for assisting the

taking over of the fibre material web (1).
Winding-up apparatus in accordance with claim 2, characterized in
that the suction zones (9) are pre-dominantly arranged in the

marginal region of the carrier drum (2).
Winding-up apparatus in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that suction devices (10) are present in the run of

the guide belt (8) for the fixation of the fibre material web (1) on the
guide belt (8). 
Winding-up apparatus in accordance with claim 4, characterized in
that suction devices (10) in the form of suction guide rolls are used

for the guidance of the guide belt (8).
