<ABSTRACT>
A golf bag includes an elongated tubular body (16), a base (17) 
secured to the bottom of the tubular body (16) and a top cap (18) secured 

to the top of the tubular body (16). The top cap (18) includes divider 
walls (20,21) which provide a plurality of club openings (57,58,59), 

and each 
divider wall (20,21) has a channel which (37,38) 

opens toward the base. The top 
of a divider panel (55,56) is adhesively secured within each channel 

(37,38) and the bottom of the divider panel (55,56) 
is secured to the base (17). The 

tubular body (16) includes a flexible panel which is formed into a 
tube, and the overlapping edge of the panel are adhesively 

secured.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to golf bags, and, more 
particularly, to a golf bag with adhesively secured club divider 
panels and an adhesively secured tubular body. Golf bags commonly include a top cap with divider walls 
which form separate compartments for groups of clubs. In order 
to protect the shafts and grips of the clubs, some golf bags are 
also equipped with divider panels which extend from the top cap 
to the bottom of the bag to provide separate club compartments 
throughout the length of the bag. The divider panels can be 
attached to the divider walls of the top cap by riveting, by 
looping the divider panel over the divider walls and stitching 
or stapling the panels, etc. In order to provide increased protection to golf clubs, 
some golf bags include a relatively stiff or rigid tube which 
surrounds the clubs. The tube can be provided by forming a 
sheet of material into a cylinder with overlapping ends and then 
securing the overlapped ends by stitching or riveting. The invention provides new methods for securing the 
divider panels and the cylindrical tubular body of a golf bag. 
The divider panels are adhesively secured within grooves in the 
bottoms of the divider walls so that the divider panels extend 
downwardly from the divider walls without any visible attaching 
structure which could scrape the clubs or the golfer's hands or 
which affect the appearance of the bag. The overlapping ends of 
the tubular body are adhesively secured with a strip of double-sided 
adhesive.  The invention will be explained in conjunction with an 
illustrative embodiment shown in the accompanying drawing, in 
which -- 
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a golf bag formed in 
accordance with the invention; Fig. 2 is a top plan view of the golf bag; Fig. 3 is a side elevational view of the top cap of the 
golf bag; Fig. 4 is a bottom plan view of the top cap; Fig. 5 is a sectional view of the top cap taken along 
the line 5-5 of Fig. 2; Fig. 6 is a longitudinal sectional view of the golf bag 
taken along the line 6-6 of Fig. 1; Fig. 7 is an enlarged fragmentary view of a portion of 
Fig. 6; Fig. 8 is a transverse sectional view taken along the 
line 8-8 of Fig. 6; and Fig. 9 is a side elevational view, partially broken 
away, showing the attachment of the tubular body to the top cap. Referring to Fig. 1, a golf bag 15 includes a tubular 
body 16, a base 17 which closes the bottom end of the body, and 
a top cap 18. The top cap 18 includes a somewhat D-shaped side 
wall 19 in top plan view (Fig. 2), a pair of

<CLAIMS>
A golf bag comprising: 
   an elongated tubular body having top and bottom ends, 

   a base secured to the bottom of the tubular body, 
   a top cap secured to the top of the tubular body, the 

top cap having an outer wall which extends around the top of the 
tubular body and at least one divider wall which extends across 

the outer wall and provides a plurality of club openings in the 
top cap, the divider wall having a channel which faces toward 

the base, and 
   an elongated divider panel within the tubular body and 

having a top end which is adhesively secured within the channel 
in the divider wall and a bottom end which is secured to the 

base.
