<DESCRIPTION>
 SYNTHETIC TRANSFECTION VECTORS Field of the InventionThis invention relates to synthetic transfection vectors. This invention is in the field of gene therapy and concerns the design and use of an entirely novel means of safely introducing therapeutic genes into mammalian and human cells to achieve various useful effects.Steady progress over the past twenty years in the field of genetic engineering, nucleic acids research, chromosome mapping, DNA cloning, and other related fields has brought modern medicine to the threshold of gene therapy. It may be possible to treat some diseases by constructing pieces of DNA or RNA which code information which could correct the physiological malfunction causing the disease. It may also be possible in agriculture to make certain beneficial changes in the protein product of some animals or plants.A crucial limiting factor in progress in this field is the difficulty of causing such new genes to enter the cells of intact organisms where they can commence doing their work. For some small animals and plants, genes have been introduced into the small number of cells involved in the early embryo and so caused to replicate and ultimately appear in many or all of the cells of the adult organism.However, this approach is not viable for treating diseases in human children or adults where the disease is discovered after conception or more commonly after birth. Further, in agriculture, this method proves to be extremely expensive and difficult to carry out when large numbers of large animals such as cattle are meant to be so treated.A variety of methods have been attempted for introducing genes into adult animals. These methods include direct injection of naked DNA plasmids into. individual cells, attempts at reapplying calcium phosphate transfection techniques, inclusion of DNA into liposomes, and construction of simulated viruses which can carry the 

 new DNA as a sort of infection. The greatest progress has been made with a group of techniques in which DNA is coated onto gold colloid particles and the particles then subject to powerful electromagnetic fields in order to accelerate them to high speeds and so to hurl them against the cell walls of tissues. The particles plunge through the tissue surface and many viable DNA chains arrive inside the cell along with their non-degradable gold carrier. To reach tissues other than skin, a surgical operation is performed, and e.g. the tip of the liver is exposed and then a bombardment is carried out. This permits access only to surface
