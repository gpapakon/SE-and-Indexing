<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to methods and kits for detecting target molecules in samples.
In particular, the target molecules can be nucleic acid fragments from clinical samples.
Embodiments of the invention provide methods for rapid and sensitive detection of target
nucleic acids.The utility of detecting target nucleic acid sequences in clinical diagnostics is well
established. Various methodologies have been developed for detecting particular target
nucleic acid sequences as diagnostic of the presence of the target organism. These include
hybridization assays which rely upon one or more tailored nucleic acid probes which are able
to hybridize or bind to sequences of nucleic acid within the target nucleic acid.The hybridization assays developed to date remain limited due to the presence of
artificial signal or noise generated during the assay and competitive with the signal generated
by captured target nucleic acid. For example, sandwich hybridization assays have been
developed which employ two separate nucleic acid probes able to hybridize to mutually
exclusive nucleic acid sequences within the target nucleic acid. One of the probes, the
detector probe, is constructed to carry a detectable label moiety to permit detection of the
captured target. The second probe, the capture probe, is constructed to permit binding to a
support as well as the target to facilitate sample purification and isolation of the captured
target. Under hybridization or binding conditions, the two probes hybridize with the target
nucleic acid to form a capture probe:target:detector probe ternary complex. Introduction of
the support under binding conditions results in capture of the ternary complex by the
support. The detector probe can then be isolated and measured to determine the presence or
quantity of target in the sample.The sensitivity of such sandwich hybridization assays is known to be limited,
however, because the detector probe will bind to the assay support directly notwithstanding
the absence of target in the sample. The binding of detector probe directly to support in the
absence of target is referred to as nonspecific binding. Additionally, the sample to be
assayed may also have other nucleic acid sequences of some similarity to the sequence
selected as the target, known as pseudo targets. These pseudo targets, at high levels 
associated with detector probe, may also bind nonspecifically to the assay support and,
further, bind to the detector probe thereby binding the detector probe to the support in the
absence of
