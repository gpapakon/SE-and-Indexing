<ABSTRACT>
Device for ultrasonic detection of foreign bodies present on the outer surface of a glass, the said device being intended to be associated with a glass comprising at least a first plate having a first thickness, a second plate having a second thickness less than the said first thickness, the said plates being assembled by a bonding layer, the said device comprising a transducer capable, via a transmitting/receiving face, of transmitting an incident ultrasonic signal having a wavelength  lambda  into the said plates, the thickness of the first plate being equal to k. lambda /2, where k is a whole number, the said transducer furthermore being capable of deriving a detection signal, characterised in that the said transducer includes a blade fixed to the said transmitting/receiving face, the said blade being intended to be fixed onto the said second plate, and in that the said blade has a third thickness such that the sum of the second and third thicknesses is substantially equal to k'. lambda /2, where k' is a second whole number.
