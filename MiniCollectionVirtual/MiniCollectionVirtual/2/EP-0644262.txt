<ABSTRACT>
An isolated gene coding for a protein 
regulating aureobasidin sensitivity. A process for 

cloning the gene with the use of the gene or a part of 
the same as a probe. A nucleic acid probe being 

hybridizable with the gene. An antisense DNA or RNA of 
the gene. A recombinant or transformant having the 

gene contained therein. An isolated protein regulating 
aureobasidin sensitivity and a process for producing 

the same by using the transformant. An antibody for 
the protein. A process for detecting the protein or 

the gene. A process for screening an antimycotic by 
using the protein or the transformant. This invention is 

useful in the diagnosis and treatment of 
diseases including mycoses.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a protein regulating the sensitivity to an antimycotic aureobasidin and a gene coding for this protein, namely, a gene coding for a protein regulating aureobasidin sensitivity. The present invention further relates to a series of the uses of the protein and the gene. Furthermore, it relates to an antibody against this protein and the use of the same.Systemic mycoses including candidiasis have increased with an increase in immunocompromised patients in recent years due to, for example, the extended use of immunosuppressive drugs and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and as opportunistic infection due to microbial substitution caused by the frequent use of widespectrum antibacterial antibiotics. Although drugs for treating mycoses such as amphotericin B, flucytosine and azole drugs (for example, fluconazole and miconazole) are now used to cope with this situation, none of them can achieve a satisfactory effect. Also, known diagnostic drugs are insufficient. For candidiasis, in particular, although there have been known several diagnostic drugs (for example, CAND-TEC for detection of candida antigen and LABOFIT for detection of D-arabinitol),none of them gives any satisfactory results in specificity or sensitivity.The reasons for the delay in the development of remedies and diagnostic drugs for mycoses as described above are that fungi causing the mycoses are eukaryotic organisms similar to the host (i.e., man) and thus not largely different from man and that knowledges of fungi, in particular, pathogenic fungi are insufficient. Therefore it is difficult to distinguish fungi from man or to selectively kill fungi, which is responsible for the delay in the development of drugs for mycoses.Recently the application of genetic engineering techniques such as antisense or PCR to the treatment and diagnosis of mycoses has been expected. However known genes which are applicable thereto and/or proteins coded for by these genes are rare (PCT Pamphlet W092/03455). Regarding pathogenic fungi, there have been cloned in recent years an acid protease gene, which has been assumed to participate in the pathogenicity of Candidaalbicans (hereinafter referred to simply as C.albicans) and Candida tropicalis (hereinafter referred to as C. tropicalis) causing candidiasis [B. Hube et al., J. Med. Vet. Mycol., 29, 129 - 132 (1991); Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 49476/1993; and G. Togni et al., FEBS Letters, 286, 181 - 185 (1991)], a calmodulin gene ofC.albicans [S.M. Saporito et al., Gene, 106, 43
