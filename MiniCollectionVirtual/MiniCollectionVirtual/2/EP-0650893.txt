<ABSTRACT>
A device for erecting tubular flattened blanks (2) 
in a line (10) for feeding cases (50) comprises 

alternative means (20) aimed at withdrawing the 
blanks (2) from a magazine (3), a conveying suction 

belt (4), operated continuously, on which the means 
(20) releases each blank (2) that is to be conveyed 

to the erecting station (40). The station (40) is 
designed to open said blank (2), in order to obtain, 

during a dwell phase (A) of the line (10), a correspondent 
case (50) located inside a housing (60) 

that is defined onto the running plane (12) of the 
feeding line (10), and by a pair of prongs (11). The 

feeding line (10) is made to advance step by step 
and in phase relation with the erecting station 

(40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to machines for erecting 
cases and/or boxes, starting from a tubular 
flattened blank. In particular, the present invention refers to a 
device that takes tubular flattened blanks from a 
magazine, prints them and conveys them to an erecting 
station connected with housing provided in a 
line for feeding the already formed cases. For a long time there have been known automatic 
machines capable of withdrawing tubular flattened 
blanks from a magazine, of erecting the cases by 
positively opening the blanks, and then of collocating 
them onto a conveying line. In the US Patent N. 3.783.752 of H.J. Langen & Sons 
Ltd., Rexdale, Ontario, Canada, a mechanical blank 
handling device is described. This device includes a conveyor equipped with sucker 
cups aimed at withdrawing the tubular flattened 
blanks from a magazine and conveying them to an 
opening station, where the blanks, still flattened, 
are gripped by special sucker cups, located opposed 
to the ones of the conveyor and therefore, they are 
opened due to the progressive moving away of the 
conveyor sucker cups from the ones of the opening 
station. The blank, opened in this manner, is released between 
the prongs of a conveyor.  
 The main drawback of this device is that it can be 
used only for blanks of big size and only with 
relatively low operative speeds. Another drawback results from the fact that the 
blank is opened before being placed between the 
conveyor prongs. Still a further disadvantage arises from the fact 
that such a device must use special sensors to 
detect the presence of the blank in order to keep 
the suckers, that grip the adjacent walls of the 
same blank, in correct phase relation. Another disadvantage results from the fact that the 
device is not provided with a blank printing station 
that intervenes on the blanks before they are placed 
onto the conveyor. Document US-A-4.348.853 discloses a case opening and 
sealing apparatus that comprises a magazine having a 
plurality of flattened blanks stacked therein, a 
conveyor underlying the magazine, and a plurality of 
suction cups for opening each case into tubular form 
for subsequent filling. Each forward case blank in the magazine is precisely 
ejected into proximity with the suction cups for 
opening purpose by a shuttle mechanism which functions 
to sequentially engage a lower edge of the 
case blank to initially prevent removal thereof from 
the magazine, move the case blank upwardly to release 
the lower edge thereof from the magazine,
