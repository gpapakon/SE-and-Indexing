<ABSTRACT>
A power integrated circuit (1) has either a vertical power component (2, 3) and a control circuit (4) for driving the vertical power component (2, 3), or only vertical power components (2, 3). In order to prevent the switching processes of the vertical power component (2, 3) from affecting in an undesirable manner the control circuit (4), an etching stopping layer (12) is applied underneath the semiconductive area where the control circuit (4) is to be produced, during the power integrated circuit (1) manufacturing process. The control circuit (4) and the vertical power component (2, 3) are then produced by usual processing steps, and a front protective layer and a rear masking layer are applied on the wafer. Once the mask is structured in order to create an opening underneath the etching stopping layer (12), the backside of the substrate is etched until the etching stopping layer (12) is reached. Alternatively, once the processing steps for producing the vertical power components (2, 3) have been carried out and once a lateral insulating layer (13) has been applied between the vertical power components, a front protective layer and a rear masking layer are produced, then the rear masking layer is provided with a recess underneath the lateral insulating layer (13) through which the backside of the substrate is etched until the lateral insulating layer is reached.
