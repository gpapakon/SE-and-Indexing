<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a fabric spreader for finishing and treatment machines, which is provided with connectors having improved sealing and ensuring a long service life. The spreader comprises a curved stationary shaft (1) carrying a row of rotary rollers (5) surrounded by a tubular rubber casing (8), each end (18) of which is fastened to a conical surface (19) of a rotary connector (7). The body (11) of the connector is mounted on a ball bearing (12) and comprises a stuffing box (25) ensuring its sealing on the shaft (1). During rotation, this sealing is improved considerably by a ring of fins (31) generating a centrifugal fluid flow in front of the entrance of the surface of the seal between the connector and the shaft. This allows the spreader to function for a long time in aggressive liquids.
