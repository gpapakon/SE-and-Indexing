<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method for making polymers
of alpha-hydroxy acids. In particular, it is directed to a method for making such
polymers by catalyzed ring opening polymerization of the cyclic esters of certain alpha-hydroxy
acids.Because of the increasing problem of disposing of industrial and
domestic wastes, there is currently substantial interest in the use of biodegradable
polymers in many applications. Among the more serious of these problems is the
disposal of various plastic wastes, containing polymers such as polyethylene,
polypropylene, polystyrene, polyurethanes and the like. These by and large are not
biodegradable, particularly after being covered, such as in a landfill. Though
polymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid and several other aliphatic polyesters are
known to be hydro/biodegradable (i.e., they are readily degradable through the
action of water and/or microorganisms.), their widespread use has been hindered
by their high cost of production. The manufacture of alpha hydroxy acid polymers
and copolymers has been costly in large part because of the difficult process by
which they have been made heretofore.The polymerization of lactide (3,6-dimethyl-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione)
and glycolide (1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione) which are composed of two units of lactic or
glycolic acid in the form of a ring, respectively is, of course, well known. In this
polymerization process, the ring monomers and any comonomers present are
heated together in the presence of a ring opening catalyst such as stannous octoate,
or a compound of yttrium or a lanthanum series rare earth catalyst or a titanate.
However, extremely low polymerization rates and the resultant long reaction times
have made continuous process for making these polymers substantially impractical
from an industrial point of view. On the other hand, the use of batch reactions for
this purpose results in polymers having excessively high melt viscosity and low
melt stability. These, in turn, lead to polymer discoloration and low yields. Such
problems have contributed to making these potentially important polymers too
expensive for widespread use in consumer applications. It has been discussed in the literature that the rate of polymerization
of, for example, lactides is dependent on reaction temperature and the amount of
catalyst. See Makromol. Chem., Vol. 188, page 1809-1814 (1987), which also
states that small amounts of water can enhance the polymerization rate of lactide.Many techniques have been employed to carry out such
polymer

<CLAIMS>
A method for preparing polymers of alpha-hydroxy
acids by catalyzed ring opening of lactide, glycolide or

mixtures thereof and comprising up to 20 weight percent of
a comonomer selected from the group consisting of epsilon

caprolactone, delta-valerolactone,1,5-dioxepan-2-one,1-4-dioxan-2-one, beta-butyrolactone, beta-propiolactone,6-methyl-2,5-morpholinedione and mixtures thereof, comprising
the steps of:


a. forming a liquid phase dispersion of the lactide
and/or glycolide, catalyst and any comonomer wherein the

mole ratio of total monomer to catalyst is 500-20,000:1 and the
mole ratio of acid impurity to catalyst is less

than 6:1, and
b. maintaining (1) the temperature of the
dispersion at 50-250°C, (2) the mole ratio of total

monomer to catalyst at 500-20,000:1 and (3) the mole ratio
of acid impurity to catalyst in the dispersion

below 6:1 to effect polymerization of the monomers at a high
rate.
A method as claimed in claim 1 in which no
comonomer is present.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein the
temperature is maintained at from 160°C to 220°C.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims which is carried out in an extruder.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims in which the mole ratio of acid impurity to

catalyst is below 2:1.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims in which the mole ratio of monomer to catalyst is

1,500-10,000:1.
A method as claimed in
claim 1 in which the dispersion contains a mixture of

lactide and/or glycolide and a polymerizable comonomer to
produce a random copolymer of the lactide and/or glycolide with the

comonomer.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims in which a conversion of about 95% is attained in

less than about 42 minutes.
