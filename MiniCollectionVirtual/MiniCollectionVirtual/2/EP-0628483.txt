<ABSTRACT>
A tape handle for a box (200) having a pour opening 
(107) adjacent a top edge (109). The handle is formed 

from a strip of handle tape 30 having an adhesive side 
and (34) and a back side (36). A strip of deadening 

material (37) shorter in length than the handle tape 
which is adhered to the adhesive side of the handle tape 

forms a handle assembly (88) having a first and second 
adhesive sections (90, 92) and intermediate adhesive 

masked section (94). The handle assembly is mounted on 
the box with its first and second adhesive sections 

adhered to opposed substantially parallel sides (101, 
105) of the box and with the intermediate section 

extending across a side (103) of the box which is opposed 
to the side of the box having the pour opening. The 

handle assembly is mounted to an upper portion of the box 
to assist in lifting the box for pouring out its contents 

through the pour opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape handle for 
use on a box having a pour opening adjacent to top edge 
of one side thereof. It is known that boxes which are continuously moving 
in a row on a conveyor belt can be automatically closed or 
sealed by means of an adhesive tape. This kind of device 
has been proven to be effective in that a relatively large 
number of cartons can be handled rather quickly. However, 
during subsequent loading and transportation of the boxes, 
the absence of a handle and the disadvantages associated 
with this become apparent. Often a carrying grip or handle 
in the form of a cord will be fastened onto a box which has 
already been sealed. This, however, requires additional 
labor and additional expense. It is known further that a carrying handle can be 
designed from adhesive tapes. An example of a tape handle 
applied after a box has already been sealed is seen in 
Blank et al. U.S. Patent No. 3,031,359. An example of a 
device which forms a tape handle on a box is disclosed in 
Gunther PCT/US88/01505. The Blank et al. patent describes 
a pressure-sensitive adhesive tape handle for carrying 
packages consisting of a filament tape having a sheet 
material base of paper or other material. The tape handle 
is applied to the box after the box has been sealed. The 
Gunther PCT/US88/01505 patent describes a process for 
application of a carrying grip or handle by means of 
adhesive tape to a row of continuously moving cartons 
during automatic packing and sealing operations. The 
adhesive side of an excess length of the adhesive tape is 
covered or masked automatically with a cover tape in an 
operational step which is synchronized with the application 
of the adhesive tape to the carton.  
 
operational step which is synchronized with the application 
of the adhesive tape to the carton. Examples of devices for applying adhesive coated tape 
are described in Collet et al. U.S. Patent 3,915,786, 
Patterson U.S. Patent 3,954,550, and Deering, Jr. U.S. 
Patent 4,238,269. Such devices are commonly used to seal 
boxes filled with merchandise. The boxes are driven past 
the device by a conveyor. These devices include an 
application member such as a roller for supporting an end 
of the tape with the adhesive side disposed outwardly in a 
contact position such that the tape end contacts the box 
moving towards the tape. Upon such contact, the tape end 
adheres to the box. As the box moves, the box pulls the 
tape from the device and the application member presses the 
tape against

<CLAIMS>
A tape handle for use on a box (200) having a pour 
opening (107) adjacent a top edge (109) of one side (111) 

thereof, the tape handle comprising: 
   a strip of handle tape (30) having an adhesive side 

(34) and a back side (36); and 
   a strip of deadening material (37) shorter in length 

than the handle tape which is adhered to the adhesive 
side of the handle tape thereby forming a handle assembly 

(88) having first and second adhesive sections (90, 92) 
and an intermediate adhesive masked section (94); 

   wherein the handle assembly is mounted on the box 
with its first and second adhesive sections adhered to 

opposed, substantially parallel sides (101, 105) of the 
box and with the intermediate section extending across a 

side (103) of the box which is opposed to the side of the 
box having the pour opening thereon and with the handle 

assembly further being mounted to an upper portion of the 
box to assist in lifting the box for pouring out its 

contents through the pour opening. 
The tape handle of claim 1 wherein the handle 
assembly (88) is mounted on the box no lower than one 

third of the height of the box (200) from its top edge 
(109).
