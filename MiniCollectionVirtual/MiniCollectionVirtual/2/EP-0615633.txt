<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic 
developer solutions for use in photographic colour 
processing and in particular to redox developer 
solutions. Redox (or RX) amplification processes have 
been described, for example, in British specification 
Nos 1,268,126, 1,399,481, 1,403,418 and 1,560,572. In 
such processes colour materials are developed to 
produce a silver image (which may contain only small 
amounts of silver) which then catalyses redox 
amplification to form a dye image. The redox 
amplifying solution contains a reducing agent, for 
example a colour developing agent, and an oxidising 
agent which is more powerful than silver halide and 
which will oxidise the colour developing agent in the 
presence of the silver image which acts as the 
catalyst. The oxidised colour developer reacts with a 
colour coupler (usually contained in the photographic 
material) to form image dye. The amount of dye formed 
depends on the time of treatment or the availability of 
colour coupler rather than the amount of silver in the 
image as is the case in conventional colour development 
processes. A particular application of this technology 
is in the processing of silver chloride colour paper, 
especially such paper with low silver levels. Since the amplifying solution contains both 
an oxidising agent and a reducing agent it is, however, 
inherently unstable and will decompose on keeping. 
This instability is catalysed during the processing by 
the seasoning of species present in the gelatin layer 
in the photographic material, such as complex 
transition metal ions such as manganese (Mn), and/or 
catechol disulphonate 'CDS', 'TIRON',TM.  
 In conventional RA-4 type developers this 
catalytic effect can be substantially reduced or 
nullified by the addition of one or more sequestering 
agents which can form a fairly stable soluble complex 
with the calcium ions or transition metal ions so that 
the free metal ions, especially ferric ions, are then 
present in only minute amounts. Such sequestering 
agents may include, for example, a polyacetic acid 
such as diethylaminetriamine pentaacetic acid 'DTPA' 
or an alkylidene -1,1-diphosphonic acid, such as 1-hydroxy-ethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic 
acid 'HEPA'. It is disclosed in EP-A-0 569 576 of even date 
herewith, that a single sequestering agent but more 
particularly a combination of two or more sequestering 
agents can have a surprising stabilising effect in 
inhibiting catalytic decomposition of a photographic 
bleach solution. It has now been found that in
