<ABSTRACT>
A video signal conversion system converts input 
video signals in a studio format, such as CCIR 601 

(625/25), into output video signals in another format, 
such as the Phase Alternate Line (PAL) format. The 

horizontal line scanning frequency of the input and 
output signals is the same. The signal conversion system 

uses an output clock signal to determine the relative 
timing of the input and output video signals. This 

signal is generated by a phase-locked loop 
(122,124,126,128) which employs 

a crystal-controlled VCO (128). The phase of the signal 
produced by the VCO (128) is adjusted to maintain the sampling 

clock signals of the input and output video signals in a 
predetermined phase relationship. The phase error signal 

which is used to control the VCO is generated by 
comparing a first
 phase reference signal, generated from 
the output signal, to a second phase reference signal 

generated from the input signal. The output phase 
reference signal may be the synchronizing signal 

component of the converted video signal or an indication 
that a predetermined interpolation phase is being applied 

by the resampling system. The input phase reference 
signal may be the input clock signal or an indication of 

the start of a horizontal line interval.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns phase locked 
loop (PLL) synchronization systems and in particular, a 
PLL system in a video signal resampling system which 
generates a synchronized clock signal for a phase 
alternate line (PAL) output video signal using phase 
information from the input video signal. Sample rate conversion systems are well known 
for converting television and other video signals from 
one format to another. An exemplary video signal 
standards conversion system is described in U. S. Patent 
No. 5,057,911 entitled, SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONVERSION 
OF DIGITAL VIDEO SIGNALS, which is hereby incorporated by 
reference for its teachings on digital resampling 
techniques. The system described in the above-referenced 
patent converts a component video signal having a nominal  
 
sample rate of 13.5 MHz into a digital signal having a 
sample rate of 14.31818 MHz, (hereinafter 14.3 MHz) which 
is compatible with the National Television Standards 
Committee (NTSC) Standard. The ratio of these two sample 
frequencies is exactly equal to the ratio of 33 to 35. To obtain good performance from the resampling 
system it is desirable for the output sample clock signal 
to be locked in phase with the input sample clock signal. 
In the referenced patent, this may be achieved relatively 
easily by dividing the input sample clock signal by 33 
and dividing the output sample clock signal by 35, 
applying both divided signals to a phase comparator and 
using the output signal of the phase comparator (not 
shown) to adjust the phase of the output clock signal. These simple techniques are ineffective, 
however, for synchronizing an output clock signal for a 
phase alternate line (PAL) video signal to a standard 
studio component video signal, such as a CCIR 601 
(625/25) signal. This signal has the same line and frame 
format as a PAL television signal (i.e. 625 lines/frame 
and 25 frames per second) but it uses a sample clock 
signal of 13.5 MHz which is 864 times the frequency of 
the horizontal line synchronization component of the 
video signal. The ideal sample clock signal for a 
sampled data PAL television signal, on the other hand, is 
17.734475 MHz (hereinafter 17.7 MHz) four times the color 
subcarrier frequency (4*fsc). This color subcarrier 
frequency, fsc, is related to the horizontal line 
frequency (fh) according to the equation (1).

fsc = 1135 * fh / 4 + 25   (1) 


 
   Because of the 25 Hz offset which is added to 
the color subcarrier frequency, the largest common 
frequency between the
