<ABSTRACT>
In known image processing systems, image 
data is filtered by a low pass filter to remove noise 

and grain from the image. A high pass filter is also 
used to produce detail signals. The high pass data is 

often cored before being added back to the low pass 
data to restore image sharpness but producing an 

overall reduction in noise and grain in the uniform 
areas of the image. Described herein is a method of 

processing image data which utilizes a look-up table 
containing a composite of an operator set coring level 

and a stored gain characteristic. This composite 
look-up table provides a wide range of composite 

characteristics which only requires a small number of 
stored gain characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of 
processing a digital detail signal, and is more 
particularly concerned with image processing systems 
which utilise digital coring techniques. When images are electronically processed, 
one of the requirements is often to reduce the 
visibility of noise or grain. This is commonly 
carried out by first low pass filtering the image to 
remove much of the noise and grain, and then restoring 
the sharpness of the final image by adding on to the 
low pass image a processed detail signal. One of the common processes for obtaining 
the processed detail signals is coring which removes 
small variations in the detail data due primarily to 
noise or grain. One current method for digital coring 
comprises the use of a comparator and switch. The 
comparator compares the level of the incoming digital 
data with a preset coring level. The output of the 
comparator then switches the digital output to a zero 
level, when the incoming data is below the coring 
level, or to the signal, or some ratio of it, when the 
incoming data is above the coring level. US-A-4 941 190 describes the use of two 
look-up tables to hold respective values corresponding 
to the gain part and the threshold or coring part of 
the detail transfer characteristic. The choice as to 
which look-up table to use is made by an adaptive 
coring system. In this system, for a given pixel, an 
annulus of points around that pixel is sampled and 
provides a background value. The pixel value is then 
compared with this background value to form a modified  
 
value for that pixel. The appropriate look-up table 
is then selected and its output is compared with the 
modified value of the pixel being considered. The 
result of this comparison is then passed on for 
further image processing. US-A-4 825 297 describes contrast 
enhancement of edges by splitting the image data into 
a low pass channel and a high pass channel. Composite 
characteristics are stored in multiple slope look-up 
tables. These look-up tables are used to process the 
high pass channel and the characteristic selected is 
dependent on the value in the low pass channel. US-A-4 962 419 discloses a signal processing 
network for colour correction and gamma compensation. 
The network includes a detail extraction circuit for 
generating a detail signal, the components of which 
are cored prior to being input to a detail enhancement 
circuit to generate an enhanced detail signal. A 
read-only memory (ROM) is used to hold a composite 
look-up table which
