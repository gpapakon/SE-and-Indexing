another in a longitudinal direction and separated from one another
by a web (9) opens in its own, reclosable filling opening (14) of a

tandem sack (7), with the chambers (8) being clearly spaced from
one another by the web (9) and the web (9) having such a large

width that when the tandem sack (7) is placed on the upper side of
a wall (5) of the container (1), the web lies on the upper side, while

the chambers (8) overhang the container wall (5) at the sides, and
when the tandem sack (7) is inserted into an only partly filled

container (1), the web (9) ensures a fixed, immovable position of the
two chambers (8).

openings (14).
A receptacle in accordance with claim 1 and claim 2 characterised
in that the web (9) separating the chambers (8) from one another

forms a unit with the overlapping region (13) at the other end from
the filling openings (14). 
A receptacle in accordance with claims 1 to 3 characterised in that
the chambers (8) separated from one another by the web (9) can be

arranged offset to one another lengthwise.
A receptacle in accordance with claims 1 to 4 characterised in that
