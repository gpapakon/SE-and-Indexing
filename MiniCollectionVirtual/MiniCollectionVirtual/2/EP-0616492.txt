<ABSTRACT>
Transcuders (114) are acted upon by milk flowing respectively from each teat of the animal into a milking claw which has an upper chamber (119) and a lower chamber (120). The transducers respond to a condition of the milk and control valves (128). If the transducer indicates normal milk, valve (128) is set to direct flow into the lower chamber (120) from which it passes via pipe (122) to a collection tank. If abnormal milk is indicated, valve (128) is set to direct flow into the upper chamber (119), from which it passes via pipe (124) to a dump bucket or drain.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to apparatus for
milking an animal and is concerned with the automatic
provision of information about the animal during milking
by monitoring the milk and detecting a monitored
condition in the milk, if such condition arises.An electrical measuring device is known from German
patent specification DE 1949559 for examination of milk
during milking for pathological changes, in particular
changes indicative of mastitis infection. Measuring
transducers, responding to the conductivity and/or
permeability and/or the dielectric constants of the milk,
are arranged to monitor milk originating from different
teats of the animal being milked.One problem is the provision of a reference standard
because the mentioned properties of the milk, even when
normal, will vary from one animal to another, from one
day to another and in dependence upon the food the animal
has been eating. The solution proposed by DE 1949559
relies upon the observation that it is common for
mastitis to affect, at least initially, only one of the
four teats of the udder. Accordingly DE 1949559 arranges
the four transducers in a bridge circuit, which goes
unbalanced if the conductivity of the milk from one teat
changes with respect to that from the other three teats.
There is, however, no direct indication of which teat is
the source of milk of changed conductivity. DE 1 949 559
suggests that it is possible to discover which teat is
the source of milk of changed conductivity by
substituting a resistor for each conductivity cell in
turn, the resistor having a resistance equal to the
resistance of a conductivity cell when filled with
uninfected milk Such an approach would be cumbersome in 
any event, but is impracticable because of the problem
mentioned above in discovering the required reference
standard for the value of the resistor on the day for the
particular animal.European patent specifications EP 0 223 536 and EP 0
018 419 describe an apparatus for monitoring parameters
such as electrical conductivity of milk during milking
and separately for each milk flow line from the
individual teats of the animal. Neither of these patent 
specifications consider the possibility of automatic
diversion of infected milk from individual teats. The
problem of a reference standard is not addressed at all
in EP 0 223 536. EP 0 018 419 proposes that the lowest
conductivity reading be adopted as the reference.
However, this is unsatisfactory as it is not unusual for
a healthy animal to produce an anomalously low reading
from one

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for use in the milking of an animal which
comprises a milking claw having a plurality of inlet

paths (110, 111, 112, 113; 18), a common outlet path
(54, 122), a subsidiary outlet path (53, 124), a respective

transducer (114, 115, 116, 117; 21) associated with each
inlet path for providing a quantitative signal

representing the magnitude of a property of milk in that
path, comparison means (OA8) for comparing the said

signal in each inlet path with a reference derived during
milking from the magnitudes of the said property of the

milk in the said plurality of inlet paths (110, 111, 112,
113; 18), the comparison means (OA8) providing an

output signal which identifies the inlet path in which
the milk has a magnitude of the said property differing

by more than a pre-determined amount from the reference
magnitude, each of the said inlet paths being provided

with a diverter valve (56, 128) capable of diverting flow
from the inlet path away from the said common outlet path

(54, 122)to the subsidiary outlet path (53, 124) characterised
in that the said transducers (114, 115, 116, 117; 21),

the respective diverter valves (56, 128) and the
inlet and outlet paths associated with the diverter

valves (56, 128) are all contained within the milking claw.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, further
characterised in that control means responsive to the

said output signal actuate the valve (56, 128) in the input
path identified by the output signal to divert flow to

the said subsidiary outlet path (53, 124).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, further
characterised in that the comparison means (OA8) and the

control means are also housed within the milking claw. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3, further
characterised in that the control means is so arranged

that, during an initial stage of milking, the valves
(56, 128) direct milk from all of the inlet paths to the

subsidiary outlet path (53, 124) and, at the end of the

operated to direct milk from the corresponding inlet
paths to the said common outlet path (54, 122).
