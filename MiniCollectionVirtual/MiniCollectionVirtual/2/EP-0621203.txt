<ABSTRACT>
Carrier stock (30) for machine application to 
substantially identical cans (12) of a newer type having an 

end with a chime (16) of a relatively small diameter, a 
cylindrical side wall (18) of a relatively large diameter, 

and a generally frusto-conical wall (20) between the 
cylindrical wall (18) and the chime (16) is formed from a 

single sheet of resilient polymeric material and has 
integrally joined band segments (34, 38) defining can 

receiving apertures (32). These include generally 
longitudinal outer segments (34), each having inner (56) 

and outer (54) edges associated with one such aperture 
(32). When the stock (30) is unstressed, two lateral 

portions (58) of the inner edge (56) are concave, two 
corresponding lateral portions (62) of the outer edge (54) 

are convex, and a central portion (60) of the outer edge 
(54) is concave. A central region (52) between the 

lateral portions (58) may have an integrally joined tear-open 
tab (50). Certain generally transverse segments (39, 

42), which join inner segments (38), may have curved 
edges (74, 76) when the stock (30) is unstressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to carrier stock for machine 
application to substantially identical cans, such as 
beverage cans having annular chimes, cylindrical side 
walls, and frusto-conical walls between the chimes and the 
side walls. Such a carrier stock is described in US-A-5 020 661, on which 
the preamble of claim 1 is based. This invention provides carrier stock in a 
unique configuration that can be effectively applied to 
cans of a newer type, with which it has been difficult to 
use carrier stock as known heretofore because the frusto-conical 
walls adjacent the lids of the cans of the newer 
type define severe, conical angles relative to can axes. Carrier stock as exemplified in Weaver et al. U.S. 
Patent No. 4,219,117 is employed commonly for machine 
application, typically with machines described in Braun 
U.S. Patent No. 4,250,682 or other similar jaw and drum 
machines, to substantially identical cans, such as beverage 
cans utilized commonly to contain beer and soft drinks. 
Such cans have annular chimes at their upper ends, 
cylindrical side walls, and frusto-conical walls between 
the chimes and the side walls. Such stock is formed, as by 
die-cutting, from a single sheet of resilient polymeric 
material, such as low density polyethylene. Such stock has integrally joined band segments 
defining can receiving apertures in longitudinal rows and 
transverse ranks. The band segments include generally 
longitudinal outer segments with each outer segment partly 
bounding the can receiving apertures in an outer row. In the carrier stock illustrated and described in the 
aforenoted patent, the band segments also include inner 
segments partly bounding the can-receiving apertures, along 
with transversely extending segments joining the inner 
segments. When such stock is applied effectively, the band 
segments defining the can receiving apertures grip the 
frusto-conical walls of the cans tightly and engage the 
lower edges of the chimes.  
 Can manufacturers have in the past introduced cans 
having smaller chime diameters, as compared to the 
diameters of the side walls. Cans of this type are known 
as "necked-in" cans. The newest version of these necked-in 
cans further and drastically reduces the ratio of the chime 
diameter and the side wall diameter. In a necked-in can of a newer type, the frusto-conical 
wall between the chime and the side wall defines a 
conical angle greater than approximately 28°, and in some 
instances as great as approximately 37°. When the 
frusto-conical wall defines

Carrier stock (30) for machine application to 
substantially identical cans (12) of a type having an end 

with a chime (16) of a given diameter, a cylindrical side 
wall (18) of a larger diameter, and a generally frusto-conical 

wall (20) between the cylindrical side wall (18) 
and the chime (16), said stock (30) being formed from a 

single sheet of resilient polymeric material and having 
integrally joined band segments (34, 38) defining can 

receiving apertures (32) in longitudinal rows and in 
transverse ranks, said band segments including generally 

longitudinal outer segments (34) with each outer segment 
(34) partly bounding one of the can receiving apertures 

(32), characterised in that each outer segment (34) has 
an inner edge (56) with two concave lateral portions (58) 

adjacent a re-entrant central region (52) which penetrates 
into its respective aperture (32) further than the lateral 

portions (58) when said stock (30) is in a flat, 
unstressed condition. 
A carrier stock according to claim 1, wherein each 
outer segment (34) has an outer edge (54) with a central 

portion (60) along the central region (52) of such outer 
segment (34) and with two lateral portions (62) adjacent 

the central portion (52) and wherein the lateral portions 
(62) of the outer edge (54) are convex when said stock (30) 

is in a flat, unstressed condition. 
A carrier stock according to claim 2, wherein the 
central portion (60) of the outer edge is concave when said 

stock (30) is in a flat, unstressed condition. 
A carrier stock according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein each outer segment (34) has a 

substantially uniform width along lateral portions (58, 62) 
of the inner (56) and outer (54) edges of such outer 

segment (34) when said stock is in a flat, unstressed 
condition.  

 
A carrier stock according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the central region (52) has an inner edge 

(70), which is convex when said stock (30) is in a flat, 
unstressed condition. 
A carrier stock according to claim 5, when dependent 
upon claim 4, wherein each outer segment (34) has a 

substantially uniform width also along the central region 
(52) when said stock (30) is in a flat, unstressed 

condition. 
A carrier stock according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein each outer segment (34) has a tear-open tab (50) 

joined integrally to the central region (52) of such outer 
segment (34). 
A carrier stock according to claim 7, wherein the 
tear-open tabs (30) extend into the can receiving apertures 

(32) when said stock is in a flat, unstressed condition, 
each tear-open tab (50) having two parallel, lateral edges 

(66), each lateral edge merging with one of the lateral 
portions (58) of the inner edge of the outer segment (34) 

having such tear-open tab via a curved transition (68) to 
avoid stress concentration. 
A carrier stock according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the outer segments (34) define outer 

edges (56) of the can receiving apertures (32) and wherein 
the integrally joined band segments further include 

generally longitudinal inner segments (38) defining inner
