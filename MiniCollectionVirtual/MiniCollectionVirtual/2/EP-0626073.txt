Method of detecting a moving underwater target 
using an active sonar comprising an antenna consisting of 

a plurality of transducers, the said method using the 
Doppler effect attached to the relative movement of the 

target and of the sonar, and comprising a stage of 
forming channels from the signals from the said transducers, 

characterized in that the said sonar emits a 
plurality of pulses at different frequencies, and in that 

the signal processing, in addition to the channel-forming 
stage, comprises stages of coherent detection for each 

pulse, each stage consisting in performing a correlation 
of Doppler copies of each pulse emitted with the signals 

received in the frequency band corresponding to the 
frequencies of reflection of the signals of this pulse, 

in order to form frequency channels associated with the 
various possible radial speeds of the target, and a stage 

of non-coherently grouping the results obtained in the 
coherent detection stage, consisting, after quadratic 

detection, in summing the signals obtained in each of the 
different frequency channels during the coherent 

detection stage. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 

that the said pulse frequencies are chosen in such a way 
that any pulse reflected from a target moving with 

extreme speed is out of the frequency range corresponding 
to the reverberation originating from any other pulse. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the said frequencies f

in which:

c
the speed of sound in water, 
V
min
the absolute value of the absolute minimum detectable 
radial speed of a target; 
V
max
the absolute maximum detectable radial speed of a 
target. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the pulses of the plurality of 

pulses are emitted simultaneously. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the pulses of the plurality of 

pulses are emitted successively. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the coherent detection stage 

consists in performing a correlation of the signals 
received on the sonar with Doppler copies of the 

different pulses emitted, each of the said Doppler copies 
defining a frequency channel. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the stage of non-coherently 

grouping the results obtained in the coherent detection 
stage comprises envelope detection, compensation for any 

delays between the pulses emitted, and summing of the 
signals of the frequency channels thus processed and 

corresponding to a single radial speed of the target. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the envelope detection is quadratic 

detection. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the stage of channel formation 

comprises the switching of the signals from the 
transducers of the said antenna in order to obtain at 

least one subantenna given a synthetic movement making it 
possible to compensate for the Doppler shift imposed on  

 
the fixed echoes by movement of the sonar.
