<ABSTRACT>
A water-proofing sheet having high hydraulic pressure resistance and high moisture permeability and having a wet type 
coagulation polyurethane film on the surface of a cloth. A clay organic composite member containing quaternary ammonium 

ions introduced between layers of swellable laminar silicates is dispersed in the wet coagulation polyurethane film 0.5 to 20 wt% 
on the basis of the solid content of the polyurethane, the hydraulic pressure resistance is at least 5,000 mm and permeability is at 

least 8,000 g/m² 24 hrs. Polyurethane is dissolved in a solvent consisting mainly of a nitrogen-containing polar solvent, and 
a solution prepared by dispersing the clay organic composite member containing the quaternary ammonium ions between 

the layers of the swellable laminar silicate 0.5 to 20 wt% on the basis of the solid content of the polyurethane is applied to a 
cloth, and the cloth is immersed in a coagulation bath to coagulate the polyurethane. Thereafter, washing with water and 

drying are carried out to prepare the water-proofing sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a waterproof sheet having
both a high water pressure resistance and a high moisture
permeability and a method for producing the same.A conventional moisture-permeable waterproof sheet is
mainly produced by coating a fabric with a solution of
polyurethane in a water-soluble solvent, and wet coagulating the
polyurethane. Rain or other types of water cannot permeate the
porous polyurethane film formed thereon when the solvent is
removed with water, but moisture (water vapor) can permeate it.However, when the porosity of the waterproof fabric is
increased (the number of pores are increased and the pore size
becomes large) to improve the permeability, the water pressure
resistance thereof does not fail to fall, and the waterproof
sheet is not waterproof. Conversely, when the water pressure
resistance thereof is improved (the number of pores is decreased
and the pore size becomes small), the moisture permeability
thereof is lowered. Accordingly, the improvement of the
moisture permeability conflicts with that of the water pressure
resistance.An object of the present invention is to overcome the
contradiction described above, and develop a waterproof sheet
having both a high water pressure resistance and a high moisture
permeability. The present invention is intended to provide a
novel waterproof fabric having both a water-pressure resistance
as high as at least 5,000 mm and a moisture permeability as high
as at least 8,000 g/m2·24 h.The present invention provides a
moisture-permeable waterproof sheet
comprising a fabric and a wet coagulated polyurethane film 
thereon, said wet coagulated polyurethane film containing from
0.5 to 20% by weight, based on the solid component of the
polyurethane, of a dispersed clay organic composite obtainable by
introducing a quaternary ammonium ion into the interlayers of a
expandable phillosilicate
in accordance with the accompanying claim 1,
and said waterproof sheet having a
water pressure resistance of at least 5,000 mm and a moisture
permeability of at least 8,000 g/m2·24 h.The waterproof sheet of the present invention mentioned
above is prepared by a process comprising dissolving a
polyurethane into a solvent containing mainly a
water-soluble
nitrogen-containing
polar solvent, dispersing from 0.5 to 20% by weight,
based on the solid component of the polyurethane, of a
organophilic clay complex prepared by introducing a quaternary
ammonium ion into the interlayers of a expandable phillosilicate
in the solution, coating a fabric with the
