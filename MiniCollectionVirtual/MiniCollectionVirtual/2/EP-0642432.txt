<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to automobile seat 
belts and more specifically to an adjuster for holding 
together the lap seat belt and the shoulder belt at a 
location where the shoulder belt does not rub against a 
neck of a seat belt wearer. Most seat belts used in vehicles, such as 
automobiles, trucks, etc., have a lap seat belt which 
extends across the lap of a wearer and also a shoulder 
belt which extends up from the attachment side of the 
belt, across the wearer's shoulder, thus providing 
protection to the wearer from being thrown forward in the 
event of a sudden stop. The lap seat belt holds the 
wearer in the seat and the shoulder belt prevents the 
wearer from jack-knifing forward. Most types of seat 
belts are adjustable for different sized passengers and 
drivers. A lap seat belt passes from one side of a seat 
across the seat to a releasable catch or attachment 
buckle on the other side of the seat. The belt passes 
through the catch or attachment buckle and then becomes a 
shoulder belt crossing over the front of a wearer and 
being attached at shoulder height above the seat at the 
side where the seat belt is initially attached. The problem with such types of seat belts is that 
the angle of the shoulder belt from the catch or 
attachment buckle often extends across the neck of a 
wearer and this can become irritating as it rubs against 
the skin causing irritation. Devices have been made for 
attaching to the lap seat belt and having a clip to hold 
the shoulder belt. These devices slide along the lap 
seat belt, thus moving the angle of the shoulder belt to 
such a location where it does not rub against the neck of  
 
a wearer. One example of such a device, according to the preamble 
of claim 1, is shown in U.S. patent 5,088,161 to Robertson. The device disclosed in U.S. patent 5,088,161 is 
formed of two parts and when it is to be removed from a 
seat belt, requires one part to be detached from another. 
This invariably results in one of the parts dropping and 
becoming lost under the seat of a vehicle or even 
dropping outside the vehicle, thus one is left with only 
one part which by itself is useless. The present invention provides a novel seat belt 
adjuster which is a one piece unit having in one 
embodiment a hinge at one end and in another embodiment 
having a series of slots with gaps allowing the seat belt 
adjuster to be attached to the lap seat belt and detached 
from it but remaining in one piece so that the parts do 
not become separated. The present invention

<CLAIMS>
A seat belt adjuster (24) for holding a shoulder 
belt (26) to a lap seat belt (20) including: 


a frame member formed of resilient material having a 
front portion (30), a rear portion (38), a top edge (32) 

and a bottom edge (34), the front portion (30) and the 
rear portion (38) forming a channel (40) therebetween for 

containing a lap seat belt (20), wherein the adjuster (24) 
may be moved along the lap seat belt (20); 
a clip member (56) forming part of the front portion 
(30) of the frame member and extending down from the top 

edge (32) to form an open clip for retaining a shoulder 
belt (26); 
the seat belt adjuster characterized by: 
a hinge (36) extending from the top edge (32) of the 
frame member and pivotally coupling the rear portion (38) 

and the front portion (30) together to permit the 
portions to open for fitting over a lap seat belt (20); 
means for retaining the rear portion (38) and the 
front portion (30) together to contain a lap seat belt 

(20) therebetween, the means for retaining being at the 
bottom edge (34) of the frame member; 
first and second pins (46) coupled to the front 
portion (30) of the frame member adjacent the hinge (36), 

the first and second pins (46) being arranged to receive 
the rear portion (38) therebetween and to prevent a lap  

 
seat belt (20) positioned between the front and rear 

portions (30,38) from contacting the hinge (36); and 
a third pin (42) extending from one of the front and 
rear portions (30,38), the other one of the front and 

rear portions (30,38) including a hole (44) for receiving 
the third pin (42), the third pin (42), when positioned 

in the hole (44), being between the first and second pins 
(46) and arranged to prevent a lap seat belt (20) 

positioned between the front and rear portions (30,38) 
from contacting the hinge (36). 
The seat belt adjuster according to claim 1 wherein 
the front portion (30) is wider than the rear portion 

(38). 
The seat belt adjuster according to claim 2 wherein 
the hinge (36) is a living hinge permitting the rear 

portion (38) to open up to about a 180Â° angle from the 
front portion (30). 
The seat belt adjuster according to claim 1 wherein 
the retaining means includes a hook member (48) 

positioned adjacent the bottom edge (34) of the rear 
portion (38) for engagement in a slot (52) formed in the 

front portion (30), the slot (52) having a ledge means 
(54) so that the hook member (48) hooks over and retains 

the rear portion (38) to the front portion (30). 
The seat belt adjuster according to claim 1 wherein 
the hinge (36) is rigid and hinge movement comprises 

flexing of the rear portion (38) and the front portion 
(30) so that an opening at the bottom edge (34) of the 

frame member is sufficient for insertion of the lap seat 
belt (20).  

 
The seat belt adjuster according to claim 5 wherein 
the means for retaining the rear portion (38) and the 

front portion (30) together includes a hook member (60) 
at the bottom edge of the rear portion (38) for 

engagement with a ledge (62) on the bottom edge (34) of 
the front portion (30) to retain the rear portion (38) to 

the front portion (30). 
The seat belt adjuster according to claim 6 

including stop means (62) adjacent the edge of the front 
portion (30) within the space (40) for the lap seat belt 

(20) to prevent the lap seat belt (20) from interfering 
with the retaining means.
