<ABSTRACT>
A process for removing iron impurities, inter alia 
iron or iron compounds, from petroleum oil distillation 

residues is disclosed in which a high gradient magnetic 
separator incorporates a pack of ferromagnetic fillers 

in the form of a generally flat or curved sheet-like 
strip. The ferromagnetic filler is a Fe-Cr alloy of a 

selected composition and the strip is of selected 
geometric characteristics such that the rate of removal 

of iron impurities can be maintained substantially at a 
maximum throughout the separation mode of operation 

prior to and after washing of the ferromagnetic filler.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for removing
iron impurities from petroleum distillation residues or
heavy oils. More specifically, the invention is
directed to such a process in which petroleum heavy oils
are magnetically treated to remove iron contents
therefrom.As has been commonly practiced in the art of
petroleum refining, residual oils resulting from
atmospheric or vacuum distillation of a crude petroleum
oil are subjected to hydrogenative treatment with use of
a fixed-bed catalyst under elevated temperature and
pressure conditions so as to obtain a variety of
petroleum products or starting feedstocks for chemical
processing.In most cases, such residual oils contain
considerable proportions of particulate iron or iron
compounds, typically sulfides, of the order of 0.1 - 100
microns which emanate during the transport of a crude
oil from a shipping tanker through a storage tank and 
delivery pipe lines to a distillation plant, or which
result from corrosion or wear of such distillation plant
equipment. Such iron impurities often accumulated to
the order of 10 - 100 wt.ppm would tend to deposit on a
catalyst bed or in between individual catalyst
particles, resulting in plugged up reactor or
deteriorated catalyst. Plugged up reactor would often
lead to objectionably increased pressure drop to a point
where the plant operation has to be discontinued.In U. S. Patent No. 4,836,914, EP-A-0 555 593 and Japanese
Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 62-54790 there is
disclosed the use of a high gradient magnetic separator
equipped with ferromagnetic fillers for removing iron
impurities from heavy oils far more efficiently compared
to centrifugal separators. However, the magnetic
separation process has a drawback in that on account of
literal limitations to the amount of iron impurities
that can be deposited on the ferromagnetic fillers, it
would require a repeated cycle of alternate energization
and deenergization of the ferromagnetic material when
handling huge amounts of heavy residual oil to be
treated. The more frequent the cycle, the less is the
rate of removal of iron impurities.With the foregoing drawback of the prior art in
view, the present invention seeks to provide a process
for magnetically removing objectionable iron impurities
typically from petroleum oil distillation residues which 
will ensure sustained efficiency and efficacy of removal
of such iron impurities regardless of the number of
cycles of magnetic energization required for the
accumulation of and deenergization for the wash-down of
