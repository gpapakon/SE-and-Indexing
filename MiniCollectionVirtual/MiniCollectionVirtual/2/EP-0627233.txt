<ABSTRACT>
Trocar assembly devices (100) are disclosed that 
include an improved elastomeric seal member (134) to maintain 

sealing engagement during off-centering or radial motion 
of instruments extending therethrough. The seal members (134) 

include an inner section (144) and an outer section (146). The 
inner section (144) has an opening formed therein (148) to permit an 

elongate instrument to pass therethrough in sealing 
engagement therewith. In accordance with certain 

embodiments, a corrugated portion (150) is formed in the outer 
section (146). In accordance with certain embodiments an 

annular floating ring separates the inner section from 
the outer section.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to surgical
instruments; and more particularly, the invention
relates to surgical trocar assembly devices for
providing communication into an anatomical cavity. The
trocar assembly devices in accordance with the present
invention include an improved seal member that is able
to maintain sealing engagement during off-centering or
radial motion of elongate surgical instruments extending
therethrough.A trocar assembly is a surgical instrument
that is used to gain access to a body cavity. A trocar
assembly generally comprises two major components, a
trocar tube and an obturator. The trocar tube having
the obturator inserted therethrough is directed through
the skin to access a body cavity through the tube in
which laparoscopic or arthroscopic surgery and
endoscopic procedures are to be performed. In order to
penetrate the skin, the distal end of the trocar tube is
placed against the skin which has been cut with a
scalpel. The obturator has a sharp point or cutting
edge at its distal end. By applying pressure against
the proximal end of the obturator, the sharp point is
forced through the skin until it enters the body cavity.
The trocar tube is inserted through the perforation made 
by the obturator and the obturator is withdrawn, leaving
the trocar tube as an accessway to the body cavity.
Examples of trocar assembly devices are disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 4,535,773.The proximal end portion of the trocar tube is
typically adjoined by a housing that defines a chamber
having an open distal end portion that communicates with
the interior lumen defined by the trocar tube. An
obturator and other elongate surgical instruments or
tools axially extend into and are withdrawn from the
trocar tube through the proximal end portion of the
chamber. It is the present practice to provide the
chamber with a sealing means, such as a sealing grommet
or gasket, through which the obturator or other
instruments extend. The sealing means seals against the
outer surface of the inserted instruments and thereby
prevents fluids and insufflation gas from leaving or
entering the body cavity through the trocar tube.It is typically necessary to manipulate a
surgical instrument extending through the trocar
assembly during a surgical procedure. In so doing, the
off-centering or non-axial orientation of the instrument
as it extends through the sealing means may prevent the
sealing means from maintaining sealing engagement with
the instrument. Accordingly, there is a need for a
trocar assembly that includes a
