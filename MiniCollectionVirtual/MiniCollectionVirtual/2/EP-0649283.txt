<ABSTRACT>
A substrate, especially raw unpackaged meat, is sterilized by UV irradiation on all sides. To prevent untreated spots due to contact with a support (29; 100; 242), support locations may be altered by shifting the substrate laterally on a grid conveyor (102, 120, 122, 124, 126), by transferring it to a second conveyor (101) with an out-of-phase grid, or by inverting (132) or tumbling (242) the substrate. Treatment may occur in a tunnel (12) having UV lamps (18) around its periphery. A downstream region of the tunnel may provide a packaging station (202, 208).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for
reducing the microbial load, e.g. on foodstuffs, especially
fresh and processed meats. It also relates to apparatus
for near-aseptic packaging of foodstuffs.The main determinant of the shelf life of many
foodstuffs stored at ambient or chill room temperatures is
microbial spoilage. The rate at which food deteriorates
through the action of microbes is governed by a great
variety of factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic.
Generally, however, the single greatest factor that
determines the rate of microbial growth (and hence the
shelf life of the foodstuff) is the total number of
microbes present on the foodstuff when it goes into store.
In order to maximise shelf life, it is important to ensure
that the foodstuff is exposed to as low numbers as possible
of microbes. It has long been known that irradiating foodstuffs
with ultraviolet rays, especially with wavelength of 235-280
nm, can be used for reducing the microbial load on
foodstuffs. This effect has achieved some commercial
success in the large scale storage of certain foodstuffs,
especially cheeses and other dairy-based products, where
comparatively large quantities of the foodstuff are stored
chilled under constant ultraviolet irradiation. This can
be particularly beneficial for foodstuffs where mould and
other fungi are the primary causes of spoilage. In these
circumstances, the conditions of ultraviolet radiation have
been selected primarily to hinder the growth of microorganisms,
rather than eliminate them.Ultraviolet light is only effective on the surfaces of
foodstuffs, since it has very little penetrative power.
This inability of ultraviolet radiation to penetrate far
into any material is possibly the root cause of the
comparatively modest success of ultraviolet treatment
generally in the food industry. Most non-liquid foodstuffs 
have convoluted surfaces with multiple invaginations which
harbour microbes that cannot be reached by UV irradiation.
The vast majority of packaging materials currently in use
in the food industry are generally effective barriers to UV
penetration; packaging materials typically used in the meat
industry, for example, may only allow about 5% of the UV
irradiation falling upon their surface through to the
packaged meat. This general opacity to ultraviolet light
of most packaging materials in the food industry limits the
potential of processes which seek to utilise the microbial
reductive powers of ultraviolet irradiation on packaged
foodstuffs. UV-transmissible food-grade

<CLAIMS>
A sterilising unit comprising a treatment
cavity defined within a tunnel (12), a plurality of UV

sources (18) distributed around the walls of the tunnel
(12) and directed radially inwardly towards the centre

of the cavity; and an apertured or UV-transmissive
foodstuff support (30) located in a central region of

the cavity such that a substantial space exists both
below and above the support (30), whereby a foodstuff

on the support (30) can be irradiated on substantially
its entire surface; 
characterised in that
 the tunnel is
composed of modular units (200,202) each defining a

respective chamber, adjacent units being linked end-to-end
in a biologically sealed manner to provide a tunnel

of desired length; there being means for transferring
foodstuff after irradiation from a first said chamber

to a second said chamber whereby the foodstuff can move
from said first to said second chamber without

biological contamination.
A sterilising unit according to claim 1
wherein a modular unit has a male end and a female end

for coupling to complementary ends of like units.
A sterilising unit according to claim 1 or
claim 2 wherein modular units are linked to provide a

desired amount of irradiation for foodstuffs passed
through the tunnel.
A sterilising unit according to any preceding
claim wherein modular units are linked to provide a 

multi-function system (200,202).
A sterilising unit according to any preceding
claim wherein the foodstuff support is conveyor means

(100) operable to convey foodstuffs through the tunnel.
A sterilising unit according to any preceding
claim wherein the walls of the tunnel have a UV-reflective

surface coating (16).
A sterilising unit according to any preceding
claim wherein the UV sources (18) are such that the UV

radiation falls essentially exclusively in the
wavelength range 220-300nm.
A sterilising unit according to any preceding
claim wherein one said modular unit (202) contains a

packaging station (208) and is coupled in a
biologically sealed manner to the or a said modular

unit (200) of the treatment cavity, said means for
transferring foodstuff being operable to convey

foodstuff directly from the foodstuffs treatment cavity
to the packaging station.
A sterilising unit according to any preceding
claim wherein the support and foodstuff transferring

means comprise a metal mesh food grade conveyor, and
there are means for displacing the foodstuff relative

to the conveyor during irradiation to expose to
irradiation the areas of the foodstuff initially in

contact with the conveyor.
A sterilising unit according to claim 9 
wherein the displacing means comprise guides or

baffles.
