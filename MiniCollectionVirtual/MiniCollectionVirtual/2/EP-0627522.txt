<ABSTRACT>
Improved process for the bleaching of mechanical pulps, characterised in that the unbleached mechanical pulp is floated at a pH value of between 4 and 
<
7, using from 0.01 to 1 % by weight, based on the mechanical pulp (bone-dry), of a cationic surfactant, the floated contraries are separated off and a bleaching sequence, known per se, is allowed to proceed.

<CLAIMS>
A process for bleaching wood pulps, in the form of a 
bleaching sequence, characterised in that the 

unbleached wood pulp is previously floated at a pH 
value of between 4 and 
<
 7, with the use of 0.01 
to 1 wt.%, referred to the wood pulp (absolutely dry), 

of a cationic surfactant, and the floated interfering 
substances are separated off. 
A process according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the surfactant used is a 

compound corresponding to the general formula 

CH
3
(CH

)
n
-N
+
(CH

-R)
3
 X

wherein: 


n is 10 to 18 
R denotes H or CH
3
X denotes Cl, Br or I. 
A process according to claims 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that, prior to the bleaching, the 

wood pulp is treated with a known per se complexing 
agent. 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that the quantity of water glass 

during the bleaching with H
2
O
2
 amounts to â‰¤2%, referred 
to absolutely dry wood pulp. 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterised in that additionally the recirculated 

water is freed from finely-divided unbleached wood 
pulp contained therein by means of flotation of 

interfering substances.
