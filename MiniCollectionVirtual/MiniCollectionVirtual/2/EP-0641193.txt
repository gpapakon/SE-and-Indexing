<DESCRIPTION>
 CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUG COMBINATIONSField of the InventionThe present invention relates to compositions comprising compounds which deplete cellular energy. The invention also relates to combinations of such compounds with compounds which induce apoptosis. The invention also relates to the use of these compositions and combinations in the treatment of anti-neoplastic disease.Background of the InventionAdenosine triphosphate, ATP, is the key energy source in major metabolic processes such as biosynthesis, active transport and DNA repair. Consequently, if ATP production is inhibited, consumption of existing ATP will result in an energy deficiency that would adversely affect the functional and morphologic integrity of the cell.Methods for selective impairment of energy metabolism have been proposed primarily involving induction of acidosiε in tumors via sustained hyperglycemia, optionally in conjunction with acid-activated prodrugs of metabolic poisons (McCarty, Med Hypotheses 16:39-60 (1985)). This approach is contingent upon particular tumors having metabolic differences relative to normal tissues sufficient to produce acidoεis, and is furthermore dependent on tumor mass being sufficiently large (and homogeneous) so that acidosis remains localized. The energy deficits thus produced are believed to be due to acidoεis-induced reductions in tumor blood flow, which are furthermore dependent on the characteristics of vascularization of a particular tumor. This approach to impairing tumor energy metabolism is therefore notSUBSTITUTESHEET 

universally, or even generally, applicable to treating a variety of forms of cancer.Several compounds are known to impair cellular energy metabolism; these compounds are discussed below:6-ANThe nicotinamide antagonist 6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN) (Johnson et al., Science 122:834 (1955)) is converted in vivo into the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) analogs, 6-ANAD and 6-ANADP. These competitive analogs of NAD and NADP cannot be reduced either chemically or enzymatically (Dietrich, Antineoplastic and Immunosuppressive Agents, ed. by A.C. Sartorelli and D.G. Johns (New York: Springer-Verlag), pp. 539-542 (1975), Dietrich et al., J. Biol. Chem. 233:964-968 (1958), and Dietrich et al, Cancer Res. 18:1272-1280 (1958)), and consequently act as potent inhibitors of NAD-dependent dehydrogenases utilized in glycolysis, in the oxidative portion of the pentose-phosphate pathway, and in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (Dietrich, Antineoplastic and Immunosuppressive Agents,
