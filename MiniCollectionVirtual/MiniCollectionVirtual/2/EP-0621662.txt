<ABSTRACT>
A lamp holder (lamp socket) is illustrated and described having a holder body, which has a holder for the lamp and lamp contacts as well as conductor connecting terminals and is made of insulating material, and having a retaining part, which can be plugged into said socket body such that it can be detached again, for holding the lamp holder on a holder support, the lamp contacts and the conductor connecting terminals being contained in a plugged-in manner close to the rearward holder side and transversely with respect to the lamp and holder body axis in a chamber-like receptacle which is likewise arranged essentially transversely with respect to the lamp axis, and this chamber forms a part of a plug-in coupling the other part of which is constructed on the retaining part, and the conductors can be plugged into the conductor connecting terminals essentially in the radial direction, through the retaining part. This results in a holder of modular construction which is designed to be extremely compact in the axial direction and is particularly suitable especially for versatile, space-saving installation requirements in the confined luminaire housings.

<CLAIMS>
A light bulb socket (10) with a socket body (11) made 
of insulating material comprising a mount for the light 

bulb and light bulb contacts as well as conductor 
terminals, and a socket foot (12) for mounting the light 

bulb socket on a socket support, the light bulb contacts 
(24, 25) and the conductor terminals (19, 20) inserted in 

the vicinity of the rear socket end transversely to the 
light bulb or socket body axis in a chamber-like recess 

(18), which is also arranged substantially transversely to 
the light bulb axis, the said chamber (18) forming part of 

a plug coupling and the conductors (29) being insertable 
into the conductor terminals (19, 20) substantially in the 

radial direction, characterised in that the socket foot 
(12) can be releasably plug-connected to the socket body 

and forms the other part of the plug connection, and the 
conductors (29) can be inserted through the socket foot 

(12) into the conductor terminals (19, 20). 
A light bulb socket according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the socket foot (12) per se forms 

part of a lamp body or a lamp body fixture such as a pivot 
or hinged arm. 
A light bulb socket according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the chamber-like recess (18) for the 

conductor terminals (19, 20) is tubular or tubular sleeve-like 
and the socket foot (12) comprises a tubular sleeve-like 

or tubular coupling element (26) for plug connection 
therewith. 
A light bulb socket according to claim 1 or one of the 
following claims, characterised in that the part (18) of 

the plug connection formed in the socket body (11) is 
essentially arranged entirely on the side of the plane of 

the rear socket body end (16) facing the light bulb.  
 
A light bulb socket according to claim 1 or one of the 
following claims, characterised in that the socket foot 

(12) comprises a coupling (37) for a, more particularly, 
releasable plug connection with a further connector element 

(40). 
A light bulb socket according to claim 5, 
characterised in that the connector element (40) comprises 

at least one conductor insertion opening (43), which 
extends substantially radially to the socket body axis when 

the socket foot (12) is secured to the socket body (11).
