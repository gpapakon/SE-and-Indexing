<ABSTRACT>
Improved adhesion to a polyolefin substrate, especially polypropylene, of surface 

layers of acrylic-based or other protective polymers in the form of a plastic film, 
sheet, or coating or a latex or solvent-based paint, ink, or coating is achieved by use 

of an intermediate layer, laminate, or veneer of a blend of segmented copolymer of a 
polyolefin and a poly(methacrylate) which is blended with a core/shell copolymer 

having a crosslinked rubber core.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a process for adhering
a surface layer to a polyolefin substrate and the use of a tie layer. The surface layer may be an
acrylic-based or other protective polymer which is in the form of a plastic film, sheet,
or coating or a latex or solvent-based paint, ink, colourant or coating. The invention
may be further applied to improve adherence or adhesion of pressure-sensitive
adhesives which may be used to bond cloth, carpet, non-woven fabrics, and plastics
to a substrate.Matrix polymers, such as ABS, may be used as substrates for acrylic plastic
sheet, film, coatings, inks, or latices, where the latter impart weatherability,
decorative effects and printability. The matrix polymers are useful in the assemblage
of automobiles and other vehicles, such as automotive interiors, trunks (boots), truck
(lorry) cabs, railroad car interiors and van (caravan) trim, equipment housing and
furniture, where they offer advantages in cost and formability over metal or wood.
Unfortunately, when an inexpensive matrix polymer, for example, a polyolefin such
as polypropylene or polyethylene, is used, the acrylic polymers do not adhere well
without special treatment, such as corona discharge or other oxidative treatments of
the substrate. Acceptable adhesives or pre-coatings for the polyolefin prior to
application of the acrylic polymer are also not readily available.Acrylic polymers, more preferably polymers of methyl methacrylate, are
useful for this purpose but are expensive and not as tough as certain plastic
substrates used in the automotive and other industries. Such acrylic polymers are
useful to achieve a combination of adhesion, toughness, and lower cost when
combined with a cheaper, tougher polyolefin in a laminar structure (which structure
may require a laminating adhesive in the case of polyolefins to prevent
delamination), or when the surface of the polyolefin is altered to promote adhesion.Thus the art has sought means for adherence of various forms of (meth)acrylic
polymers to inexpensive polyolefin substrates as a means for protecting, coloring, or
adhering to such polyolefins, without the use of expensive extemal physical
treatment such as corona discharge.There are several ways of causing adhesion between a non-polar substrate,
such as a polyolefin, and a paint, coating, or ink. One is a tie layer between the
polyolefin and the surface layer which must develop adequate adhesion.

A process for adhering a surface layer to a polyolefin substrate comprising the steps of

a) forming a tie layer comprising a blend of:

(i) from 5 to 95 parts per 100 parts of tie layer of a multi-stage polymer containing
a crosslinked core, wherein the core is formed from at least 50% of at least one

of butadiene or butyl acrylate, and wherein the second-stage is formed
from at least 50% methyl methacrylate, and wherein the ratio of first-stage to

second-stage polymer is at least 3/2; and
(ii) from 95 to 5 parts per 100 parts of tie layer of a segmented copolymer having
at least one segment of a non-polar polyolefin formed from at least 50% of

ethylene or propylene and having at least one polar segment of a polymer
formed from at least 80 weight percent of an alkyl methacrylate, the weight-average

molecular weight of all segments being above 20,000, the ratio of
polar segments to non-polar segments being from 9:1 to 1:4.
b) applying the tie layer under heat and pressure to the polyolefin substrate;
c) separately and concurrently applying the surface layer to the tie layer; and
d) where necessary, drying the surface layer to produce an adherent film.
Process of claim 1, wherein the segmented copolymer is a segmented copolymer of
polypropylene and a polymer containing at least 80 weight percent of units of methyl

methacrylate.
Process of claim 1 or 2 wherein the tie layer is a film which is in the form
of a continuous plastic matrix of thickness less than 0.25 mm (10 mils) or a sheet which is a

continuous plastic matrix of thickness more than 0.25 mm (10 mils).
Process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the polyolefin substrate is
polypropylene. 
Process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the polypropylene is a glass-filled
polypropylene sheet.
Process of any of claims 1 to 5 wherein the tie layer is either co-injection molded or
co-extruded with the polyolefin substrate
Process of any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein the surface layer is a (meth)acrylic film or
laminate, a paint, an ink or a coating.
Use of a tie layer comprising a blend of:

(i) from 5 to 95 parts per 100 parts of tie layer of a multi-stage polymer containing
a crosslinked core, wherein the core is formed from at least 50% of at least one

of butadiene or butyl acrylate, and wherein the second-stage is formed
from at least 50% methyl methacrylate, and wherein the ratio of first-stage to

second-stage polymer is at least 3/2; and
(ii) from 95 to 5 parts per 100 parts of tie layer of a segmented copolymer having
at least one segment of a non-polar polyolefin formed from at least 50% of

ethylene or propylene and having at least one polar segment of a polymer
formed from at least 80 weight percent of an alkyl methacrylate, the weight-average

molecular weight of all segments being above 20,000, the ratio of
polar segments to non-polar segments being from 9:1 to 1:4. for adhering a

(meth)acrylic film, a paint, an ink or a coating to a polyolefin substrate.
