<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain improvements 
in the catalytic alkylation of aliphatic hydrocarbons 
in the presence of an acid catalyst, and, more particularly, 
to the recovery of such catalyst from acid soluble oil 
being formed during the processes. Acid catalysed alkylation of aliphatic hydrocarbons 
with olefinic hydrocarbons is a well-known process for the 
preparation of high octane gasoline products. Alkylation of 
aliphatic hydrocarbons is generally accomplished in the 
liquid phase by reacting paraffins and olefins in the presence 
of a strong acid catalyst. Conventionally used acids in industrial alkylation 
processes are hydrogen fluoride and sulphuric acid. Utilization of fluorinated sulphonic acids as efficient 
alkylation catalysts in the alkylation of aliphatic 
hydrocarbons with olefins, is disclosed in European Patent 
Application No. 433,954. 
By the disclosed process, a process stream, including 
a hydrocarbon substrate and an olefinic alkylating 
agent, is reacted in contact with a fluorinated sulphonic 
acid catalyst in a fixed bed alkylation reactor containing 
polar contact material. On the contact material is established 
a reaction zone with the fluorinated sulphonic acid 
catalyst adsorbed within a confined area of the contact 
material. In the reaction zone, the process stream is 
converted at alkylating conditions to a product stream of 
alkylated hydrocarbons by catalysis of the fluorinated 
sulphonic acid adsorbed on the contact material. During the alkylation reaction the acid catalyst 
and, consequently, the reaction zone moves as a well-defined 
band between the ends of the reactor due to interaction 
with the process stream flowing through and reacting 
in the zone.  
 During the migration of the acid catalyst on the 
contact material, the catalytic activity of the fluorinated 
sulphonic acid is substantially retained and the acid is 
still catalytic active, when the reaction zone reaches the 
reactor outlet. Although it is possible to reuse the acid catalyst 
without recovery of the acid as it reaches the outlet end 
of the alkylation reactor by reversing the flow direction 
of the process stream introduced into the alkylation 
reactor, small amounts of the acid catalyst will continuously 
be absorbed in acid soluble oil being formed by side 
reactions during the process. The acid soluble oil adsorbs 
like the acid catalyst as a movable band on the support 
material adjacent to the reaction zone. It is, thus, possible 
to withdraw the acid soluble oil from
