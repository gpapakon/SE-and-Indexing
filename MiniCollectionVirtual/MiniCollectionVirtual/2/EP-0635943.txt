<ABSTRACT>
This stage contains emitter-follower transistors (3, 4) which are controlled by complementary signals and the emitters of which are connected to a current source (5) by a switch-over device (6). The switch-over device (6) switches the current impressed by the current source (5) to the emitter of the emitter-follower transistor (3 or, respectively, 4) which is currently carrying the H level. The switch-over device (6) preferably contains two emitter-coupled switching transistors (14, 15) which are connected to the current source and the base terminals of which are in each case connected via in each case one bipolar transistor (17, and, respectively, 16) connected as emitter follower to the emitter of one of the emitter follower transistors (3 and, respectively, 4).
