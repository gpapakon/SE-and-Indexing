<ABSTRACT>
Coin-sorting apparatus (10) with electromagnetically actuated, pivotably mounted flaps (18, 20, 22, 24, 28) in at least two planes one above the other which guide the coins entering from above into associated accepting shafts or the like, the electromagnets assuming an active current-receiving state and an inactive state and being pretensioned into the inactive state by means of a spring, and a control device generating control signals for the electromagnets according to coin-value signals from a coin tester arranged above the sorting apparatus, the flap in the lower plane having a perforation or recess, the optical axis of a light barrier (A, B) being aligned with the perforation or recess, and the control device generating a cut-out signal for the electromagnet of at least one flap when a coin moves into the light barrier or out of this.

<CLAIMS>
A classifying device (10) for coins comprising pivotally journaled flaps (18, 20,
22, 24, 28) actuated by solenoids arranged in three planes one above the other,

said flaps guiding coins entering from above to associate accept chutes or the
like, further comprising control means for generating control signals for the

solenoids depending on the coin denomination signals of a coin testing device
arranged above the classifying device, providing a light barrier (A, B), said control

means generate a switch-off signal for the solenoid of at least a flap (8, 20,
22, 24, 28) when a coin enters or leaves the light barrier (A, B), wherein the

solenoids to actuate the flaps (20, 22, 24, 28) are either activated to attain a
current drawing condition or inactived and which solenoids are biased by a

spring towards the inactive condition, characterized in that the flaps (20, 22, 24,
28) arranged in the lower planes include an aperture (52, 54, 56) or a recess (50)

cooperating with the light barrier (A, B) each, wherein the optical axis of the
corresponding light barrier is aligned to the aperture (52, 54, 56) or to the recess

(50).
The classifying device of claim 1, characterized in that the signal delivered by a
light barrier (A, B) serves to actuate a solenoid each of a flap arranged above.
The classifying device of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the flaps (18 through
28) engage a stopper (30, 32, 34, 36, 40) with its upper end in the inactive position

of the solenoids and that a space is provided between said flaps and this
position and the wall associated to the stopper which space is larger than the

dimensions of the coins. 
The classifying device of one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the control
means generates the energizing signals for the solenoids in the flap planes

successively with respect to time.
The classifying device of one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the signal
delivered by a light barrier (A, B) defines a credit signal at the same time.
The classifying device of one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the control
means comprises a monitoring circuit associated to a pair of light barrier planes

(A, B) which monitoring circuit senses the sequence of the signals with respect
to time generated by the light barriers (A, B) and generating an erasing signal or

the like, when the signal of the lower light barrier (B) is generated before the
signal of the upper light barrier (A) occurs.
