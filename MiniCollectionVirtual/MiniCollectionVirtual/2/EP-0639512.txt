<ABSTRACT>
A reclosable carton (30) comprises a gable top formed by folding 
on crease lines (25) upper side panels (19) and when reclosure 

of the carton (30) is effected, a flap (17) is folded inwardly 
between the inwardly folded side panels (19) and an adjacent 

front or rear panel (12) to trap a folded neck of a liner (31) 
and thereby enhance closure of the liner (31).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reclosable carton of substantially 
rectangular configuration comprising front and rear panels and 
two side panels. In US-A-4 484 683 there is disclosed such a carton in which 
upper portions of the side panels are scored along lines 
extending downwardly from a top of the carton. The carton 
contains a liner in the form of an inner bag and the arrangement 
is such that reclosing of the carton results in the side panels 
folding inwardly along the score lines and upper portions of the 
front and rear panels being brought together. Generally, the 
front panel is provided with a closure flap having a tab and the 
rear panel is provided with a slot for receiving the tab to 
effect closure of the carton. It is envisaged that an upper 
portion of the liner during reclosure would be folded over a top 
edge of the rear panel and would thereby be trapped by the 
closure flap when the carton is closed and the liner thus would 
be air tight while the carton remains closed. A disadvantage of such an arrangement is that the folded over 
liner is bulky at the upper rear surface of the carton and 
causes the tab to spring out of engagement with the slot, 
thereby reducing the efficacy of the closure. A further 
disadvantage is that it is necessary to provide a liner of 
greater than normal depth to ensure that the upper portion of 
the liner extends over the top edge of the rear panel of the  
 
carton. The increase in size of the liner is an increase in the 
cost of manufacture. The invention is characterised in that the other of the front or 
rear panels which is not provided with the closure flap is 
provided with a restraining flap which is adapted to be inserted 
between the inwardly folded side panel portions and an adjacent 
front or rear panel so as to trap an upper portion of the liner. Since the liner is not folded over an upper edge of the carton 
to cause it to be trapped, there is no pressure acting against 
the closure flap when the carton is closed. Following is a description, by way of example only and with 
reference to the accompanying drawings, of one method of 
carrying the invention into effect. In the drawings:- 
Figure 1 is a plan view of a blank for forming into a carton in 
accordance with the present invention, Figures 2 to 4 inclusive are diagrammatic representations 
indicating stages in a procedure for effecting closure of the 
carton, Figure 5 is a cross section on the line V-V of Figure 4, Figure 6 is a partial plan view of a modified blank for forming

adapted to fold inwardly and one of the front or rear panels 
(11, 12) being provided with closure flaps (16, 17, 18, 19) 

characterised in that the other of the front or rear panels 
is provided with a restraining flap which is adapted to be 

inserted between the inwardly folded side panel portions and 
an adjacent front or rear panel (11, 12) so as to trap an 

upper portion of the liner (31). 
2. A carton (30) as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in that 
the side panels (13, 14) are each provided with a flap (18, 

19).

upper portions of the said panels (13, 14) and corresponding 

flaps (18, 19) are provided with lines of weakening (24, 25, 
26, 27) for effecting folding of the material of the carton 

(10).
