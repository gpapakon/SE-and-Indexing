<ABSTRACT>
A multistorey, collapsible three-dimensional framework has storey platforms (1) for receiving storage goods. The platforms (1) are linked to each other by articulated vertical rods (4). The platforms (1) have carrying arms (5, 6) which project obliquely upwards and downwards beyond the plane of the platform and which carry hinges (2, 3) for the vertical rods (4) at their free ends. The articulated axle of the hinges (2, 3) is spaced apart from the ends of the vertical rods (4) and coupling devices (7) which lie in the coupled state on the plane of the platform are arranged at the ends of the vertical rods (4).
