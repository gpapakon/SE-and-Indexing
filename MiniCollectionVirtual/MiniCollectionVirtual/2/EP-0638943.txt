<ABSTRACT>
A bulk magnetoresistance effect material of a 
composition represented by the general formula: 

T
100-A
M
A
 
(wherein T is at least one element selected 

between Cu and Au; M is at least one element selected 
from the group consisting of Co, Fe, and Ni; and A is 

in the range: 1 ≦ A ≦ 50 by atomic percent) is 

prepared by casting a molten mixture of the above 
composition, and subjecting the resulting casting to 

homogenization and further to heat treatment. The 
bulk magnetoresistance effect material is high in the 

rate of change in the electrical resistance thereof, 
i.e., shows a large magnetoresistive effect and can be 

obtained in such bulk form in arbitrary shapes 
adaptable for various uses. Using the material, 

various types of magnetoresistive elements are 
obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process of producing a bulk
magnetoresistance effect material having a thickness of 0.1 to 500 mm
which can be worked into an arbitrary shape such as a
sensor requiring a complicated shape, a sensor for use
in a site wherein a heat resistance is required
thereof, a sensor additionally having the function of
a structural material, or a sensor having a high
corrosion resistance.Magnetoresitive elements are widely utilized as
magnetic field sensors and magnetic heads since they
are high in sensitivity and capable of securing a
comparatively large output. In such magnetic field
sensors and such magnetic heads, a direct-current
magnetic field is applied thereto as a bias for the
purpose of enhancing the sensitivity thereof and
bringing the response thereof close to a linear one.
Thin Permalloy films, which show a magnetoresistivity
of about 2% and are as small as about 5 Oe in
anisotropic magnetic field as the yardstick of
easiness of magnetization thereof and hence easy of
application thereto of a bias, have heretofore been
widely used as the magnetoresistive elements. Further, multi-layered film magnetoresistance
effect materials comprising alternatingly laminated
thin magnetic films differing in coercive force (e.g.,
see Japanese patent Laid-Open No. 280,483/1992) are
known as means for magnifying the change in the
electrical resistance thereof. This kind of multilayered
film giant magnetoresistance effect material
(GMR) involves a problem that conduction electrons are
scattered depending on the direction of the
magnetization of the magnetic layers thereof, while
scattering of conduction electrons varies depending on
the correlation of magnetization between magnetic
particles themselves dispersed in the matrix of the
granular GMR. Further, high-precision control of the
thickness periodicity of films to be laminated one on
another is needed to involve problems such as a
difficulty in production of such a material, a
necessity of expensive equipment, and a difficulty in
the working of the resulting material due to the
laminate film structure thereof, leading to an
incapability of fabricating it into various shapes
adapted for uses thereof. Moreover, this kind of
multi-layered film GMR, which is obtained by the
sputtering method, the liquid quenching method or the
like, involves a further problem that it is restricted
in the form thereof, particularly in the thickness
thereof so that only a thickness of at most about 0.1
mm is attainable.EP 0 590 434 A1 discloses a
