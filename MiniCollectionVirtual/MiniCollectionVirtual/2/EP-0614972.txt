<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an enzyme N-acetyl-D-glucosamine
deacetylase capable of hydrolyzing the
acetamide group of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine to produce D-glucosamine
and acetic acid
which acts
specifically on the monomer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine,
and not on the oligomers including dimer and the polymer.The present invention also relates to a process for
preparing the above described enzyme, and to a process
for hydrolyzing said acetamido group using the
deacetylase of the present invention.D-glucosamine, the deacetylated product of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine,
is useful as pharmaceuticals, foodstuffs,
and intermediates for the preparation of pharmaceuticals.
In addition, oligosaccharides consisting of D-glucosamine
unit have increasingly been drawing attention and
becoming important as having valuable physiological
activities such as antibacterial, antifungal and
antitumor activities.D-glucosamine has hitherto been prepared from N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 
which is prepared from purified
chitin (β-1,4-poly-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, obtained from
the cuticle (crust) of a crustacean such as prawn or crab
by removing inorganic salts, proteins and lipids), by
deacetylating with a conc. alkali or mineral acid.However, the hydrolysis of the N-acetyl group of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine
does not progress so easily and
therefore, relatively hard reaction conditions are
necessary to complete the hydrolysis, for example,
heating for a long period of time in a concentrated acid
or alkali such as 30-60 % solution, leading to an
increase in the formation of undesirable by-products, and
the yield of the desired D-glucosamine is low. Moreover,
the elimination of the acid or alkali used necessitates
additional elaboration and expense.There has been a need for developing more mild
methods of deacetylating N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in a high
yield without the formation of undesirable by-products,
and a biological method using an enzyme capable of
deacetylating N-acetyl-D-glucosamine has been
investigated.As biological deacetylation methods, there have been
several references known wherein microorganisms belonging
to Mucor sp., Aeromonas sp. or Colletotrium sp. are used. In a method using a microorganism belonging to Mucor
sp., soluble glycol chitin and the pentamer are
deacetylated to the extent of 12-14 %, but there is no
disclosure of a deacetylase acting only on the monomer of
N-acetyl-D-glucosamine [Y. Araki, E. Ito, Biochem.
