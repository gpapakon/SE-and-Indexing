<ABSTRACT>
A sealing arrangement consists of the frontal walls pressed against each other of two building elements made of concrete, armoured concrete or the like, in particular tubular tunnel segments. The sealing arrangement further consists of a rope-shaped seal (27) made of elastomeric material for sealing the gap between the building elements or tubular tunnel segments. The seal has a base (28) enlarged on both sides with respect to the sealing part (29), forming flanges which, together with corresponding additional anchoring parts, secure the seal on one of both front walls of the building elements or tubular tunnel segments. The sealing part forms a single piece with the base and has a trapezoidal cross-section, so that with respect to the base its width diminishes at the same time as its side flanks (30, 31) are tapered, and seals the gap between the building elements or tubular tunnel segments when the latter are pressed against each other. The essential trait of the invention is that at least two, in particular at least three rope-shaped channels (33 to 40; rows I, II, III), are arranged inside the trapezoidal sealing part (29).

A sealing arrangement which consists of

endwalls (2, 5) which are pressed together, as belonging to two
components of concrete, steel-reinforced concrete or the like,

especially segments (1, 4) of tubular tunnel; as well as of
a continuous seal (3, 7) of elastomeric material to seal the gap (6)
between the components or segments of tubular tunnel, where the seal

at the base has a part (13) which referred to the seal part (14) is
widened on both sides to form flanges (15, 16) and fastened by means

of these flanges and corresponding additional anchoring parts (8, 10,
11, 12) to one of the pair of endwalls (2) of the components or segments

(1) of tubular tunnel, whilst the seal part which is combined
in one piece with the base part and as seen in cross-section has a

trapezoidal shape, that is, of decreasing width referred to the base
part, with its flanks (21, 22) at the sides converging to correspond,

takes over the sealing of the gap when the components or segments of
tubular tunnel are pressed together; and where
on the underside (17) of the base part (13) there are at least three
continuous open or closed grooves (18, 19, 20), the groove (18) which

is arranged in the region of the longitudinal central plane X being
at least 30% wider and/or deeper than those 
grooves (19, 20) which
are arranged either side of it and run essentially with mirror symmetry

about the central groove (18);

characterized in that

the base part (13) has a minimum width 
a
 of 300 mm, its flanges (15,
16) exhibiting a minimum thickness 
b
 of 50 mm as well as a minimum
projection 
c
 of 40 mm;
the flanks (21, 22) at the sides of the trapezoidal seal part (14)
which exhibits a minimum height 
d
 of 250 mm, run at the same angle α
of from 5 to 15°, i.e., with mirror symmetry referred to the longitudinal

central plane X, the seal part having an endface (23) which
- referred to the longitudinal central plane X - has a shape of

essentially mirror symmetry; and further, exclusively in the centre 
of the seal part (14), that is, in the region of the longitudinal

central plane X, there are at least two, in particular at least three
continuous channels (24, 25, 26) which are arranged directly one

above the other.
A sealing arrangement which consists of

endwalls (2, 5) which are pressed together, as belonging to two
components of concrete, steel-reinforced concrete or the like,

especially segments (1, 4) of tubular tunnel; as well as of
a continuous seal (3, 27, 41) of elastomeric material for sealing
the gap (6) between the components or segments of tubular tunnel,

where the seal at the base has a part (28) which referred to the seal
part (29) is widened on both sides to form flanges (15, 16) and fastened

by means of these flanges and corresponding additional anchoring
parts (8, 10, 11, 12) to one of the pair of endwalls (2) of the components

or segments (1) of tubular tunnel, whilst the seal part which
is combined in one piece with the base part and as seen in croos-section

has a trapezoidal shape, that is, of decreasing width referred
to the base part, with its flanks (30, 31) at the sides converging to

correspond, takes over the sealing of the gap when the components or
segments of tubular tunnel are pressed together; and where
on the underside (17) of the base part (28) there are at least three
continuous open or closed grooves (18, 19, 20), the groove (18) which

is arranged in the region of the longitudinal central plane X being
at least 30% wider and/or deeper than those grooves (19, 20) which

central plane X, the seal part having an endface (32, 42) which
- referred to the longitudinal central plane X - has essentially a

shape of mirror symmetry; and further there are distributed within
the whole cross-sectional area of the seal part (29) continuous channels

said channels - referred to the longitudinal central plane X - being
