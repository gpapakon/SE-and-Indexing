<ABSTRACT>
A planar micro-motor and method of fabricating it are 
disclosed. The planar micro-motor comprises a 

stator (31,38) supported by the substrate (40) and 
preferably comprising a plurality of circumferentially 

spaced micro-coils (31-38) lying in a first plane. The 
micro-motor also has rotor (10) comprising a plurality of 

magnetic regions (18,23) circumferentially spaced about a 
shaft (17) for rotation in a second plane parallel to, and 

spaced from, the first plane. Actuating means selectively 
energize subsets of the micro-coils (31-38) to generate 

electromagnetic fields acting on the magnetic regions (18-23) 
of the rotor (10) across the planar gap sandwiched 

between the micro-coils and the rotor. The amount and 
direction of rotation of the rotor (10) can be controlled. 

The planar micro-motor can be employed as a stepper motor. 
It can be fabricated using microfabrication techniques.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a micro-motor,
more particularly to a planar micro-motor and to
microfabrication thereof. The planar motor has a planar
stator and a parallel, aligned, planar rotor with force
generating magnetic fields applied across the planar gap
separating the stator and rotor.Microfabrication techniques have long been known to
those skilled in the art for production of microelectronic
circuits. More recently, such microfabrication techniques
have been applied in the production of three dimensional
mechanical microdevices for applications, for example, in
the fields of micro-optics, mechanical and medical
engineering and the like. Using such techniques,
microstructures can be fabricated comprising a variety of
materials in meeting conductivity and other functional
requirements. Microdevices are possible, for example,
comprising nickel or nickel-cobalt components for high
mechanical stability. Biocompatible materials can be
incorporated for biomedical devices. Ceramics also can be
incorporated. Opportunities in automotive applications have
been identified for miniature motors. Miniaturization
offers improved packaging and cost reduction opportunities.Technologies for microfabrication and the associated
miniature devices often are referred to as MEMS for
microelectromechanical systems. MEMS technologies include
those that employ the thin-film deposition and patterning
procedures of the silicon electronics industry. Cost
efficiencies can be achieved through batch processing of
silicon wafers. MEMS techniques have been used, for
example, in bulk micromachining of pressure sensors and
accelerometers. More recently, thin films of
polycrystallize silicon supported on a sacrificial layer
have been used to produce even smaller versions of such
devices. Miniature electrostatic motors and electrically
driven actuators also have been fabricated using MEMS. A 
new microfabrication technology known as LIGA (a German
acronym taken from words referring to lithography,
electroplating and injection molding) expands MEMS to
designs based on plastics, metals, alloys and ceramics.
LIGA also supports batch processing and uses all of the
thin-film technologies of the silicon-based electronics
industry. A common denominator of LIGA and silicon
micromachining is that both processes typically begin with a
photolithography step. In LIGA a two-dimensional pattern is
projected into a thick polymer film forming a latent image.
This image is then developed by chemical removal of the
exposed regions leaving a
