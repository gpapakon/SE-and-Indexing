<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antenna unit which is
surface-mountable on a circuit board or the like, and more
particularly, it relates to a surface-mountable antenna unit
which is preferably applied to a mobile communication device or
the like, for example.An antenna unit must be excellent in characteristics such
as the gain and return loss, while further miniaturization is
required for an antenna unit which is applied to a mobile
communication device or the like.In general, (a) an inverted-F antenna unit, (b) a
microstrip antenna unit and (c) a dielectric-loaded monopole
antenna unit are known as those which are suitably used in high
frequency ranges.An example of the inverted-F antenna unit (a) is described
in "Small Antennas" by K. Fujimoto, A. Henderson, K. Hirasawa and
J. R. James, Research Studies Press Ltd., England. With
reference to Fig. 1, an exemplary inverted-F antenna unit 1 is
now described. The inverted-F antenna 1 has a rectangular metal
plate 2 which serves as a radiating part. An edge of the metal
plate 2 is partially perpendicularly bent to form a ground 
terminal 3. Another edge of the metal plate 2 is also partially
bent to form a feed terminal 4.Due to the aforementioned structure, it is possible to
mount the inverted-F antenna 1 on a printed circuit board by
inserting the ground terminal 3 and the feed terminal 4 in
through holes which are provided in the printed circuit board.In the inverted-F antenna 1, however, it is difficult to
reduce the metal plate 2 in size due to an insufficient gain.
Further, the printed circuit board for receiving the antenna 1
must be provided with through holes for receiving the ground
terminal 3 and the feed terminal 4. In other words, it is
impossible to surface-mount the inverted-F antenna 1 on the
printed circuit board.An example of the microstrip antenna unit (b) is described
in "Microstrip Antennas" by I. J. Bahi and P. Bhartia, Artech
House, for example. With reference to Figs. 2A and 2B, an
exemplary microstrip antenna unit 5 is now described. The
microstrip antenna unit 5 comprises a dielectric substrate 6
having a rectangular plane shape. The dielectric substrate 6 is
provided on its upper and lower surfaces with a radiating
electrode 7 and a shield electrode 8 respectively. The shield
electrode 8 is formed substantially over the lower surface of the
dielectric substrate 6, excluding a portion to be connected with
a coaxial cable and a connector 9. The connector 9 has an inner
conductor which is electrically connected to a feeding
