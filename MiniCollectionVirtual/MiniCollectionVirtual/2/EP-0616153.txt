<ABSTRACT>
The gear-changing device for a manual gearbox has a single gear-change slot for the gear lever of the gearbox, in which slot forward gears of the gearbox can be selected stepwise by pivoting the gear lever backwards or forwards manually out of a central position. For this purpose, the pivoting motion of the gear lever is converted into a translational motion of an intermediate member which displaces gear-change plates with gear-change gates in a gate change mechanism relative to one another. These gear-change gates are penetrated by a sliding block which is guided in a constrained manner by them and which is displaced from a first into a second end position upon each pivoting movement of the gear lever in the gear-change slot. The sliding block is connected by way of a cable control to the gearbox, in which individual forward gears are selected depending on the end position.

<CLAIMS>
A gear-shift device for a manually operated gearbox of a motor vehicle, with a selector 
lever pivotable manually into a plurality of positions in one plane, and with transmission 

members arranged between the selector lever and the manually operated gearbox, wherein 
at least forward gears of the gearbox are shifted by pivoting the selector lever forwards 

or backwards out of a central position, and all the forward gears (
G1
 ... 
G6
) can be 
shifted up or down in steps by pivoting the selector lever (2) forwards or backwards in a 

single plane, and the selector lever (2) is connected to a transmission device (18, 23) 
converting the pivoting movement of the said selector lever (2) into a movement of an 

intermediate member (23, 24), and the said intermediate member (23, 24) displaces a 
slide-block mechanism (28, 29, 30, 53) in such a way that a slide pin (33) forcibly guided 

in the said slide-block mechanism is displaced into two end positions (
E1
, 
E2
), 
characterized 
in that
 all the forward gears are shifted by pivoting the selector lever in a single 
gear-shift gate (5) of a slide block, the transmission members transmit a pre-selection 

movement and a gear-shift movement separately from each other, the slide-block mechanism 
(28, 29, 30, 53) comprises at least two slide-block members (28, 29) displaceable 

relative to each other by the intermediate member (23, 24) and provided with gear-shift 
slide blocks (25, 26) traversed by the slide pin (33), wherein a path of movement (37) of 

the slide pin (33) connected to the transmission member (3) associated with the gearshifting 

movement is fixed between the end positions (
E1
, 
E2
) of the said slide pin (33) 
by the relative displacement of the two gear-shift slide blocks (25, 26) towards each 

other, and at least one forward gear (
G2
, 
G4
, 
G6
; 
G1
, 
G3
, 
G5
) is shifted in each end 
position (
E1
; 
E2
), and a change-over mechanism (32) is arranged between the slide-block 
members (28, 29) and the intermediate member (23, 24) in such a way that the 

slide-block members (28, 29) are displaced towards each other in an alternate manner by 
each pivoting movement of the selector lever (2) in the gear-shift gate (5). 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the slide-block mechanism has a 
third slide-block member (30) with a third gear-shift slide block (27) transversed by the 

slide pin (33), wherein the displacement of the said third slide-block member (30) displaces 
the slide pin (33) on its path of movement (37) into a central position (
E3
) situated 
between the end positions (
E1
, 
E2
) of the said slide pin (33) and corresponding to idling 
of the gearbox. 
A device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the slide-block mechanism  
 

has a further slide-block member (53) with a further gear-shift slide block transversed by 
the slide pin (33), wherein the displacement of the said further slide-block member (53) 

displaces the slide pin (33) on its path of movement (37) into a position corresponding to 
a reverse gear (
R
) of the gearbox. 
A device according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the slide block (1) of the selector 
lever (2) comprises only the single gear-shift gate (5) in which both each forward gear 

(
G1
 ... 
G6
) and the reverse gear (R) and an idling setting of the gearbox can be shifted 
by pivoting the selector lever (2). 
A device according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the slide block (1) of the selector 
lever (2) comprises a transverse gate (8) adjacent to its central position (M), the transverse 

gate (8) opening into an auxiliary gate (9) extending parallel to the gear-shift gate 
(5). 
A device according to Claims 2 and 5, 
characterized in that
 by pivoting in the transverse 
gate (8) the selector lever (2), disconnected from the intermediate member (23, 24), 

displaces the third slide-block member (30) so as to set the central position (
E3
) of the 
slide pin (33). 
A device according to Claims 3 and 6, 
characterized in that
 by pivoting in the auxiliary 
gate (9) the selector lever (2) displaces the further slide-block member (53) so as to set 

the reverse gear (
R
). 
A device according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 by pivoting in the opposite direction 
in the auxiliary gate (9) into a rapid-gear-shift position (
Q
) the selector lever (2) 
actuates a stepped gear-shift mechanism (43) connected to the transmission member (4) 

associated with the pre-selection movement, wherein a pre-selection position - associated 
with the first forward gear (
G1
) - on the gearbox is set in this position (
Q
).
