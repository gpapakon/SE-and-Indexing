<ABSTRACT>
Organic-inorganic composite particles which include a 
(meth)acrylic resin framework and a polysiloxane 

framework having in its molecule an organosilicon 
containing a silicon atom directly and chemically 

combined with at least one carbon atom of the 
(meth)acrylic resin framework, and also containing 25 

wt% or more of SiO₂ which constitutes the polysiloxane 
framework and has a mean particle diameter of ≧ 0.5 µm. 

The particles have the mechanical resilience necessary 
to maintain a constant gap distance between a pair of 

members to be arranged with the correct gap distance 
between them, and the hardness and fracture strength 

necessary to maintain the gap constant with smaller 
numbers; and also do not readily cause physical damage 

to the members. The composite particles can be 
employed as spacers for a liquid crystal display as 

they stand or with an adhesive layer formed on the 
surface. The composite particles can also have a 

conductive layer formed on the surface, and be employed 
as conductive particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates td organic-inorganic
composite particles, to a production process therefor and to
liquid crystal displays which employ the organic-inorganic
composite particles.Liquid crystal displays (LCD) typically include two
opposed electrode substrates, and spacers and a liquid
crystal substance interposed between the aforementioned
electrode substrates. The spacers are employed in order to
maintain a liquid crystal layer uniform and constant in
thickness.High speed of response, high contrast, and a wide
viewing angle, etc. are among display performance
characteristics cited as required in practice in liquid
crystal displays. For these performance characteristics to
be manifested, the thickness of the liquid crystal layers,
and in the final analysis the distance separating the two
electrode substrates, must be maintained strictly constant.Spacers for liquid crystal displays which meet such a
need include silica particles made by the sol-gel method
(Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) 62-269933),
the calcined product of the aforementioned silica particles 
(Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) 1-234826),
and styrene or divinylbenzene type polymer particles
obtained by suspension polymerization of styrene monomers or
divinylbenzene monomers, etc. (Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication (Kokai) 61-95016), etc. These are all spherical
particles with a narrow particle diameter distribution and a
well ordered particle diameter.However, the above prior art has the following
problems.
(A) Calcined products of silica particles made by the
sol-gel method are not readily deformable and are very hard,
and consequently when they are pressed in constructing
liquid crystal displays they may cause physical damage to
coating layers on the substrates such as vapor deposited
electrodes, etc., orientating layers and color filters,
etc., and cause faults in the display due to image
unevenness or breakages of TFT array. There is also a large
difference between the thermal expansion coefficient of
these calcined silica particles and that of liquid crystals,
and consequently in liquid crystal displays using such
calcined silica particles the problem of so-called low-temperature
bubbling is produced, so that when cooled in a
low temperature environment, of -40°C for example, the
particles do not shrink to the same extent as the liquid
crystals; voids are produced between the liquid crystals and 
the electrode substrates, and the display function becomes
completely inoperative.(B) Silica
