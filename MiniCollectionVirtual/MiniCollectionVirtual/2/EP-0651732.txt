<DESCRIPTION>
 EMULSIFIED FURAN RESIN BASED GLASS FIBER BINDING COMPOSITIONS AND PROCESS OF BINDING GLASS FIBERSCross-Reference To Related ApplicationThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 886,668, filed May 19, 1992, and entitled Glass Fiber Binding Compositions, Process Of Binding Glass Fibers, And Glass Fiber Compositions" .Field Of The InventionThis application relates to emulsified furan resin based binding compositions for glass fibers, a process for binding glass fibers using the disclosed binding compositions, and also two glass fiber compositions made with the disclosed binding compositions.Background Of The InventionFiber glass comes in many shapes and sizes and can be used for a variety of applications. A general discussion of fiber glass technology is provided in "Fiber Glass" by J. Gilbert Mohr andWilliam P. Rowe, Van Nostran Reinhold Co., New York 1978 which is herein incorporated by reference.As discussed in "Fiber Glass", glass fibers are generally mass produced in two types: bulk or blown fiber for insulation and allied applications, and continuous-filament, or reinforcing fibers. In either form raw fiber glass is abrasive and easily fragmentized. Damage to the individual glass fibers can occur as a result of the self-abrasive motion of one fiber passing over or interacting with another fiber. The resulting surface defects cause reductions in overall mechanical strength. 

 Consequently, binders have been developed to prevent these problems. A typical binder may prevent the destructive effects of self-abrasion without inhibiting the overall flexibility of the finished glass fiber product. Extremely good resistance and resilience to conditions of elevated humidity and heat are beneficial in view of the wide variety of end use applications for glass fiber/binder compositions.One of the most important performance properties is a consequence of the practical realities of the glass fiber manufacturing business. Cured glass fiber/binder compositions are normally very bulky and voluminous. Batts and rolls used as insulation in buildings have densities ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 pound per cubic foot (pcf) and generally require binder contents of 3 to 7% by weight. Since it is prohibitively expensive to ship such materials in an uncompressed state, the batts and rolls are bundled and compressed in packages to 8 to 25% of their manufactured thickness. During the shipping process these packages are normally subjected to conditions of elevated temperature and humidity. Once the compressed
