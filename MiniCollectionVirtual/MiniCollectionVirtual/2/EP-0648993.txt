<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a heating and/or temperature-maintaining
furnace for slabs, as set forth in the main
claim.The heating and/or temperature-maintaining furnace
according to the invention comprises an intake roller
conveyor and an outlet roller conveyor for the slabs, which
are advantageously of a type having a great width and a
heavy weight, that is to say, slabs having a width up to
2500-3000 mm. and a thickness from 30 mm. up to 200 mm.With a view to reducing greatly the dimensions of the
doors for access to the furnace as compared to those
required for a frontal entry into and exit from the furnace
and to achieving a great reduction of the losses of heat
during the operations of moving the product, furnaces have
been disclosed in which the entry into and exit from the
furnace take place laterally with the axis of movement of
the slab at a right angle to the axis of movement of the
slab inside the furnace.This embodiment makes possible also a better seal
engagement of the plant for gases and a better control of
the problems of a mechanical type resulting from the
operation of movable closure systems of great dimensions.Rollers have been employed so far which are installed as
cantilevers and of which the working surface is placed
sideways to the position of the supports of their rotary
shaft so as to keep outside the furnace the mechanical parts
which support and rotate the rollers.This embodiment can be applied only to iron and steel
products of a long type such as billets, blooms and narrow
slabs but cannot be applied to products having a great width 
and heavy weight such as the slabs of the type described
above.In view of the dimensions required for the rollers the
state of the art entails many and substantial losses of heat
along the drive shaft of the rollers.Moreover, in view of the great weights involved, the
embodiment of the state of the art does not enable the
required levelness and stability of the roller conveyor to
be ensured.So as to obviate these problems, DE-C-37 36 674 and DE-C-37
38 317 have disclosed embodiments whereby the slabs are
moved into the furnace on a roller conveyor consisting of a
plurality of pairs of coaxial and opposed rollers, each
roller of each pair being installed on its own roller-bearing
bogie positioned outside and to one side of the
furnace.According to these documents each roller-bearing bogie
includes one or more rollers placed side by side and
parallel to each other; these roller-bearing bogies can move
at a right angle to the direction of movement of
