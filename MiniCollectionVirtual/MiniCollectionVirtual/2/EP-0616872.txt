<ABSTRACT>
A ring-shaped abrasive member (2) is formed of a 
plurality of sheets of abrasive cloth paper (1) laminated and 

bonded together. The abrasive member (2) is formed with a 
plurality of cuts (3) so as to extend inwardly from its outer 

edge or extend outwardly from its inner edge. On the back 
of the abrasive member (2) is secured a wheel substrate 

together with adhesive. The abrasive member (2) is pressed 
against a workpiece while rotating the abrasive member to 

abrade the workpiece. The powdery debris and abrasive 
grains trapped in the cuts (3) will move toward the outer 

periphery of the abrasive member (2) and be discharged from the 
outer ends of the cuts (3). When the topmost abrasive sheet 

forming the abrasive member (2) gets worn out, the sheet 
thereunder will be exposed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an abrasive wheel 
comprising an abrasive member made from a plurality of 
abrasive-coated cloth papers and a wheel substrate. An abrasive wheel of this type is disclosed in 
Examined Japanese Utility Model Publication 1-114273. This 
abrasive wheel comprises a substrate (disk) and a plurality 
of sheets of abrasive-coated cloth paper having abrasive 
grains bonded to their surfaces and bonded to the substrate 
so as to be arranged radially. The sheets of abrasive-coated 
cloth paper may be fixed to the substrate radially 
or in an inclined state with respect to the substrate 
surface. This type of abrasive wheel is mounted on the rotary 
shaft of a hand grinder. When in use, the sheets of 
abrasive-coated paper are pressed against a workpiece while 
rotating the wheel to abrade the workpiece. When pressed against a workpiece, the sheets of 
abrasive-coated cloth paper are inclined in the direction 
opposite to the direction of rotation of the disk. At the 
corner portions of the workpiece, the inclined pieces tend 
to erect by their own resilience since they are bonded at 
only one end thereof, so that they are pressed hard against 
the corner portions of the workpiece. Thus, the corners of  
 
the workpiece are likely to be rounded off. When abrading a weld bead, the sheets of abrasive-coated 
cloth paper tend to be pressed not only against the 
weld bead but against a welded portion due to their 
resilience, thereby abrading the welded portion. Further, any abrasive powder or grains that separate 
from the pieces of abrasive material while abrading will be 
trapped between the subsequent pieces of abrasive material 
and the workpiece. Thus, the sheets of abrasive-coated 
cloth paper are likely to clog with such abrasive powder 
and grains. This markedly deteriorates the abrading 
efficiency. Moreover, since the sheets of abrasive-coated cloth 
paper have to be arranged radially and bonded one by one 
with adhesive to the substrate, it was extremely 
troublesome to manufacture such an abrasive wheel. Thus, 
its mass-productivity was low and its cost extremely high. It is an object of this invention to provide an 
abrasive wheel which will not round off a corner portion of 
a workpiece, which does not abrade a portion of a workpiece 
not intended to abrade or the boundary between a portion of 
the workpiece to be abraded and its portion not to be 
abraded, which shows a high abrading efficiency, and which 
can be mass-produced economically. According to this invention, there
