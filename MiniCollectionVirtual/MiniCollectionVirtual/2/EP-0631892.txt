<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for the manufacture of curved 
insulating glass, for use on automobiles, is made 

providing separate paths for the two sheets of glass 
making up the insulating glass complex, until the 

assembly station (M) is reached. Two separate 
centering stations (D and D1) are also provided. 
The apparatus has, in the single assembly station 
(M), a pressing device (13) to press the insulating 

glass (V) until the desired thickness is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
manufacture of curved insulating glass, particularly 
suited for use as windscreens in automobiles. The insulating glass is made up of two sheets of 
monolithic glass, separated by an interspace containing 
dehydrated air, held apart by spacers in aluminium or 
plastic material, containing hygroscopic salts and 
sealed at the edges using suitable materials. In 
recent times this type of glass has become more and 
more widely used in the field of car windscreens, 
preferably to replace the traditional monolithic 
tempered windscreens. When applied to cars, the sheets of monolithic 
glass forming the insulating glass are also tempered, 
for safety reasons. Manufacture on an industrial level of this type of 
product for the car industry gives rise to problems 
relating to cost and quality. Object of the present invention is therefore to 
provide an apparatus capable of manufacturing curved 
insulating glass, providing a quality level suitable to 
be accepted by the market, and with restricted 
manufacturing costs. The above advantages can be obtained using a 
highly automated apparatus, which does not require 
manual intervention except during the stages upstream 
and downstream of the apparatus itself. The automatic handling of the glass itself takes 
place without in any way touching the surfaces destined 
to form the inside of the insulating glass, so as to 
reduce to a minimum the risk of rejects due to marks or 
finger prints on the inner surfaces. Automation of the whole manufacturing cycle also 
allows repetition of operations, thus guaranteeing a 
high level of quality in the finished product. An object of the present invention is therefore an  
 
apparatus for the manufacture of curved insulating 
glasses for use as windows in automobiles, including 
stations for loading, centering, butyl rubber 
application, assembly, adjustment of thickness and 
unloading, characterized in that it comprises: 
a first transport line for internal glass with a 
first carrier moving between an internal glass loading 
station and a first internal glass centering and butyl 
rubber application station; a second transport line for external glass with a 
second carrier moving between a first position, in 
which said carrier engages with an external glass in 
the loading station and another external glass in a 
second centering station, and a second position, in 
which said carrier engages with an external glass in 
said second entering station and an external glass in 
an

An apparatus for the manufacture of curved 
insulating glasses for use as windows in automobiles, 

including stations for loading, centering, butyl rubber 
application, assembly, adjustment of thickness and 

unloading, characterized in that it comprises: 

a first transport line (4) for internal sheets of 
glass (I) with a first carrier (2) moving between an 

internal glass loading station and a first internal 
glass centering and butyl rubber application station 

(D); 
a second transport line (10) for external glass 
(E) with a second carrier (11) moving between a first 

position, in which said carrier (11) engages with an 
external glass (E) in the loading station and another 

external glass in a second centering station (D1), and 
a second position, in which said carrier (11) engages 

with an external glass (E) in said second entering 
station (D1) and an external glass in an assembly and 

thickness adjustment station (M); 
a third transport line (12) connecting said first 
(4) and second (10) transport lines and comprising a 

third carrier (14) moving between a first position, in 
which said third carrier (14) engages with an internal 

glass (I) in said first internal glass centering and 
butyl rubber application center (D) and a complex 

assembled in said assembly and thickness adjustment 
station (M), and a second position, in which said 

carrier (14) engages with the complex assembled in said 
assembly station (M) and an assembled complex in the 

unloading station. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, in which 
said second carrier (11) transporting external sheets 

of glass comprises a first suction cup (19) at a first 
end to engage with an external sheet of glass (E) in 

the loading station, an arm (24) horizontally rotatable 
around its axis and having, at the opposite end to said 

 
first suction cup (19), a second suction cup (22), and 

a motor reduction unit (25) connected to the other end 
of said arm (24) to rotate said arm around itself and 

to make an external sheet of glass (E) engaged on said 
second suction cup perform a 180Â° turn, so that said 

overturned external sheet of glass (E) can be assembled 
with an internal sheet of glass (I) present in said 

assembly and thickness adjustment station (M). 
An apparatus according to claims 1 or 2, 
further comprising in the assembly and thickness 

adjustment station (M) a device (13) provided with 
actuators (27) and pressure wheels (31, 32), which is 

provided with degrees of freedom sufficient to allow it 
to follow the edge of the assembled complex (V) in 

order to press the two sheets of glass (I, E) together 
with the butyl rubber bead (P) and to obtain the 

desired thickness in said complex (V). 
An apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding claims, in which said first centering station 

comprises push rods (8) provided with suction cups to 

engage with the internal sheet of glass, and actuators 
(6) to center the glass, so that the sheet of glass 

carried by the suction cups (3) on the first carrier 
(2) is engaged in a centered position by the suction 

cups on said push rods (8) for the application of the 
butyl rubber bead in the first centering station (D). 
An apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding claims, in which said second centering 

station (D1) comprises push rods (8') provided with 
suction cups to engage with the external sheet of glass 

and actuators (6') to center the glass, so that the 
sheet of glass carried by the suction cup (19) on the 

second carrier (11) is engaged in a centered position 
by the suction cups on said push rods (8') in said 

second centering station (D1) during the return of said 
second carrier (11) to its starting position.
