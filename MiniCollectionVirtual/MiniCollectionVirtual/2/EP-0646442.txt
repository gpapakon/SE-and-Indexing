<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a vibrating drive for a shaft stub. In the case of this vibrating drive, a rotating shaft (10) driven by a motor (9) is positively coupled to the foot (12) of the shaft stub (13) via a connecting-link guide. The foot (12) is arranged to be radially displaceable in the connecting-link guide by means of the piston of a hydraulic cylinder (14).

<CLAIMS>
A device for use in connection with the filling of a non-risable 
mixture into the pressing tool comprising a plurality of cavities 

with steep side walls to be filled with said mixture, which consists 
of pressing mass dividers adapted in their shape to the shape 

of said cavities, and secured to a frame, and disposed in said 
cavities during the filling-in process, and in which said frame is 

connected to a shaking drive mechanism, 
characterized
 in 
that said shaking drive mechanism (7) is controlled in such a way 

that said pressing mass dividers (6), after said shaking drive 
mechanism (7) has been turned off, will assume mid-positions 

within said cavities (3). 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that 
said frame is connected to a shaking drive mechanism (7) which 

comprises a shaft (10) driven by a motor (9), with said shaft 
(10) being form-fittingly coupled to the base member (12) of 

said shaft end (13) via a connecting link guide, and in which 
said base member (12), by the action of a piston, is disposed 

capable of being radially displaced by a limited distance within 
said connecting link guide.  

 
A device as claimed in Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized
 in 
that said piston is operated by a hydraulic cylinder (14) to which 

energy is applied on one side. 
A device as claimed in Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized i
n that 
the radial displacement of said base member (12) is cushioned by 

the action of a spring (15) and restricted by a screw-type limiting 
stop (16).
