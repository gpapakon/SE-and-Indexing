<ABSTRACT>
An interferometric measurement scheme utilizing squeezed light wherein an input pulse is split (14) into two consecutive input pulses (15a, 15b) separated by a time interval that is less than the inverse spectral width of GAWBS. The two pulses are further split (16) into first (20a, 20b) and second (22a, 22b) pairs of pulses and are caused to propagate in opposite directions through a fiber optic interferometer loop (18) and are recombined upon exiting the loop (16). The recombined pulses are caused to pass through a (pi) phase modulator (38) which modulates one of the two pulses. The output is then introduced to a balanced detector (50) where the detected signal of the two is averaged such that GAWBS noise is cancelled.

<DESCRIPTION>
 OPTICAL INTERFEROMETERWITH SQUEEZED VACUUM AND REDUCEDGUIDED- COUS IC-WAVE BRILLOUIN SCATTERING NOISEField of the InventionThis invention relates to fiber optics. More particularly, the invention relates to fiber optic interferometric detectors which employ light squeezing.Background of the InventionLight of any nature, including continuous wave . and pulsed light (hereinafter collectively referred to as light beams), comprises shot noise. Shot noise is quantum noise. Shot noise exists because the rate of photons in a light beam is not uniform but is random to a certain extent. The smallest increment with which the phase or amplitude of a light beam can be determined, i.e., the accuracy of phase or amplitude determination, is limited by shot noise. For example, in a fiber optic interferometer in which two light pulses are compared to each other by a balanced detector after they counter propagate through an optical fiber loop, the accuracy of the balanced detector in detecting a phase difference between the two pulses is limited by the shot noise of the system.Optical squeezing is a method for reducing the effect of shot noise. When light is introduced into 

an optical fiber at very high intensity, i.e., on the order of 1 kilowatt or greater, the index of refraction of the fiber varies slightly for different intensities. This difference in index of refraction causes the speed at which photons of different intensities travel through the fiber to be different, resulting in relative phase shifts for light pulses of different intensity.In an optical fiber in which squeezing is not occurring, the probable phase and amplitude of an intense light beam follows a generally gaussian distribution. The amplitude distribution of the vacuum state would be generally circular, as shown by circle 11a in the phasor diagram of FIG. IA, and the field of the light could be anywhere within the circle. If the light had an amplitude of X and a phase of θ then the phasor diagram would be as shown in FIG. IB and the field of the light may be anywhere within circle lib. However, in an optical fiber experiencing squeezing, the probable phase and amplitude of light is altered due to nonlinear light effects in the fiber.The phasor diagram of a squeezed vacuum is elliptical, as shown at 13a in FIG. 2A. FIG. 2B illustrates the situation for squeezed light of amplitude X and phase θ at 13b. The orientation of the major axis of the ellipse is a function of the phase shift. A light beam which has a phase θ such that it is oriented
