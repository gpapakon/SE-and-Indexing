Device for conveying waste water produced in a dental
surgery, which waste water contains solid particles, to

a central separating unit (28), comprising a collecting conduit
(30) leading from the separating unit, and at least one

connection conduit (32) leading from the collecting conduit
to a work station (14), characterised in that
 there is provided
at the end, remote from the collecting conduit (30),

of each of the connection conduits (32) an intermittently activated
flushing medium source (44, 70; 146) which provides a

mixture consisting of water and air as the flushing medium and
in that the flushing medium source (44, 70) has a reservoir

(44) for a volume of water (92) having an inlet which is connectable
to a flushing air opening (68) by means of a flushing

air valve (70) so that the latter is connectable (70) to the
associated connection conduit (32) substantially at the same

time as the interior of the reservoir (44). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the
flushing air opening (68) lies above the surface of the

volume of water (92) and is controlled by a servo valve
(70).
Device according to claim 2, wherein the disposal
connection is the inlet of a central separating unit (28)

for the solids particles and the air outlet of the
separating unit (28) is connected to the inlet of a

suction machine (26), characterized in that the servo
valve is formed by a station selecting valve (48) by

means of which a vacuum consumer (78) of the work station
(14) is connectable to the connection conduit (32). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that a sound absorber (72) is associated with

each of the flushing air openings (68).
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that the reservoir (44) is constructed as a

siphon.
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the reservoir (44) is connected to a

controllable flushing water source (62).
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that the
reservoir (44) has in its top wall (96), in the part

lying above the siphon inlet portion (98), a connection
(108, 110) for a conduit (50) that leads to the cuspidor

(58), and a connection (112) for the flushing air control
valve (70), and is provided in its portion lying above

the outlet chamber (104) with a connection (114) for a
station selecting valve (48) and preferably in addition

with a connection (116) for a supplementary air valve
(46).
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised
in that the reservoir (44) is connected 
via
 a
cut-off valve (52) to an intermediate store (54) arranged

downstream of the cuspidor (58) of the work station (14).
Device according to any one of claims 3 to 8,
characterized in that an operating sensor (82) is in each

case associated with the vacuum consumer (78) of a work
station (14), and a control unit (40) is acted upon by

the output signals of all the operating sensors (82) and
supplies an activation signal for the flushing medium

source (44, 70) for a predetermined period of time (122)
whenever the number of operating sensors indicating that 

the associated vacuum consumer (78) is operating is below
a predetermined minimum.
Device according to claim 9, characterised in that
the activation signal is passed to the flushing medium

sources (44, 70) 
via
 delay elements (124), the delay time
of which is coordinated with the length of the respective

connection conduit (32).
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that the reservoir (44) is in each case

connected to a controllable flushing water source (62),
and an output signal of a manually operated switch (128)

or of a clock (142), which act on the control terminal of
the flushing water source (62), is passed 
via
 a delay
element (138) to a control circuit (122) which then

produces an activation signal for the flushing medium
source (44, 70) for a predetermined period of time.
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that the or an additional flushing

medium source (146) comprises a mixing element (150)
which is connectable 
via
 a first servo valve (156) to a
water source (32) under pressure, especially a fresh

water conduit, and is connectable 
via
 a second servo
valve (158) to a compressed air source (16 to 20).
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 12,
characterised in that, at least in portions of the

connection conduits (32) and/or of the collecting conduit
(30), conduit parts (32-II) are provided that are of

reduced diameter in comparison with adjacent conduit
parts (32-I, 32-III).
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 13,
characterised in that swirling means (144) are provided 

in the connection conduits (32) and preferably also in
the collecting conduit (30).
Device according to claim 14, characterised in that
the swirling means (144) are formed by indentations of

the conduit wall.
Device according to claim 14 or 15, characterised in
that the swirling means (144) are arranged irregularly

with regard to their extent and/or their orientation
and/or their spacing from one another.
