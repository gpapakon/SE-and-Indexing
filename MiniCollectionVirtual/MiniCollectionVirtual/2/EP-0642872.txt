<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims at providing a welding method capable of preventing generation and re-deposition of metallic fumes 
a: portions near the surface of a weld portion and capable of reducing a deposition quantity of chromium carbides. The present 

invention further aims at providing a welding stainless material free from deposition of fumes, a semiconductor fabrication apparatus, 

an ultra-pure water feeding apparatus and an ultrahigh-pure gas feeding piping system. In a method of connecting a plurality 
of stainless members by fusing and solidifying predetermined portions (weld portions) of these stainless materials, the 

welding method of this invention is characterized in that heat input quantity to the weld portions is set below 600 joule/cm. Furthermore, 
the welding method is characterized in that the welding rate is set to below 20 cm/min. The stainless material is characterized 

in that when the welded body is washed with ultra-pure water (at flow rate of 15 l/hr for 6 hours) after welding, the sum of 
elution quantities of Fe, Ni, Cr and Mn is not greater than 0.1 µg per cm of the weld length.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a welding stainless 
material preventing fumes of metallic atoms from attaching 
the material after being welded, process apparatus, ultra-pure 
water feeding apparatus, ultrahigh-pure gas feeding 
system, and welding method. Tungsten-inert gas welding, arc gas welding, and 
electron beam welding are widely used for joining metallic 
members. These existing welding arts hardly take account of 
the surface roughness of a weld or adhesion of metallic 
fumes generated at the weld. Therefore, burning, surface 
crack, or deposition of chromium carbide occurs at the weld 
and thereby problems occur such that impurities mainly due 
to metallic powder are produced and the mechanical strength 
decreases after a long time. In the case of the existing welding art, metallic atoms 
and metallic fumes which are lumps of the metallic atoms are 
evaporated and scattered from a metal melted portion which 
is a welded portion and they are cooled in the vicinity of  
 
the welded portion to be and adhered again. It is found 
that the adhered metal peels off particularly by applying a 
corrosive gas to it and resultingly it is found that a 
process atmosphere is contaminated and deteriorated, and 
this causes a large problem in a semiconductor fabricating 
apparatus, gas feeding pipe system, and ultrapure water 
producing and feeding system which particularly require 
high-cleanliness of atmosphere. Moreover, in the case of the existing welding art, a 
weld bead becomes wide and its surface becomes rough. 
Furthermore, extreme deposition of chromium carbide occurs, 
thereby generating intergranular corrosion, etc.. The above adhesion of metallic fumes, surface roughing 
of a weld, and surface deposition of chromium carbide are 
more minutely described below by referring to the 
accompanying drawings. Fig. 13 shows the constitution of 
tungsten-inert gas welding of a piping material according to 
the exiting method. In the figure, symbol 403 represents a 
tungsten electrode and 401 represents a piping material to 
be welded. Symbol 406 represents a weld and 408 represents 
metallic fumes produced at the weld. The metallic fumes 408 
adhere to the surface of the piping material 401 at the 
downstream side of the weld 407 due to the flow of an arc 
gas or back-shielding gas and becomes an adhered metal 409. 
Moreover, in the case of the existing welding method, 
atmospheric air mixes with the welding atmosphere to cause 
the burning 406 on the weld surface because the welding  
 
atmosphere is
