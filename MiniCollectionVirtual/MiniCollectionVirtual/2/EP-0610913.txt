<ABSTRACT>
An optical fiber switching apparatus having a guide frame (11) 
which is supported by an apparatus body (31). The guide frame has 

a guide groove (12). Disposed on the guide grooves (12) is a movable 
moving member (14). The moving member can be moved by the 

apparatus along the guide groove. A slide terminal (17) is 
connected by a support to the moving member (14). The support 

allows the slide terminal to approach the moving member and 
thereby causing the slide terminal to enter an unlocked 

position or to move away from the moving member and thereby 
causing the slide terminal to enter a locked position. The 

slide terminal support an end face of an optical fiber (20). The 
apparatus also includes a driving wire (22) which has two end 

portions. The end portions are disposed through the moving 
member and are coupled to the slide terminal, thereby forming 

a loop in the driving wire. The apparatus can move the slide 
terminal by causing tension in the driving wire so as to cause 

the slide terminal to enter the unlocked position, and thereby 
allowing the moving member to move along the guide groove by a 

longitudinal movement of the driving wire.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical fiber 
switching apparatus that can be used in a coupling portion 
which performs operations such as switching for systems in 
which optical fibers are coupled so as to constitute a fiber 
optic network or the like. Although an optical fibers have been used in trunk line 
communication systems, research aimed at introducing fiber 
optic network systems is currently being conducted. Unlike 
systems which repeat transfers from point to point, it is 
necessary for a fiber optic network system to provide superior 
serviceability and efficiency for the distributed users which 
are on the same level. In order to design such a fiber optic 
network system, it is important to provide a switching 
apparatus such as, for example, an optical cross-connection 
apparatus, an optical switch board, etc. for switching the 
optical fibers without adversely affecting the light signals 
transmitted therein. Apparatuses such as the optical cross-connection 
apparatus are often referred to as "huge optical switches". 
Although various research is being conducted, it has proven 
difficult to develop a relatively small optical switch which 
has multiple inputs and multiple outputs. The difficulty 
arises because the number of coupled lines becomes large when  
 
optical fibers are coupled in a network. The optical fibers 
become so crowded that the working efficiency of the coupled 
optical fiber decreases drastically. It is also possible for 
the optical fibers to be misconnected. Moreover, the 
overcrowding of the optical fibers becomes even more severe 
when a coupling point is intended to be switched to another 
terminal. A conventional optical switch which has been used for the 
aforementioned switching is a "1 × N" (i.e. single × plural) 
type optical switch. In a 1 × N type optical switch, a 
single-core connector is disposed on the "1-side" (i.e. 
single-side) while a plurality of single-core connectors are 
disposed on the "N-side" (i.e. plural-side) on the same level. 
Thus, the single-core connector on the 1-side is carried by a 
switching mechanism, thereby allowing the 1-side single-core 
connector to be coupled with a desired connector on the N-side. Another conventional optical switch is a "N × M" (i.e. 
plural × plural) type optical switch. In an N × M type 
optical switch, a plurality of guide rails disposed in the 
direction perpendicular to each other are provided. The 
optical fibers are attached to slide terminals which can move 
along a corresponding one of the
