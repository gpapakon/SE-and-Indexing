<ABSTRACT>
The system includes an assembly for controlling the movement of the tailboard or sideboard, part of which assembly is formed of a tailboard or sideboard ram (16) connected to this board and to the rest of the dump body; an assembly for locking the tailboard or sideboard, part of which assembly is formed of a ram (24; 24') linked to a latch and to the rest of the dump body; and a fluid control valve (40) which allows the tailboard or sideboard an open position (43) in which one control chamber (29; 29') of the locking ram is connected to the pump whilst one control chamber (18) of the tailboard or sideboard ram (16) is connected to the tank (42); as well as a closed position (46) of the tailboard or sideboard in which the connections are reversed.

System for controlling a vehicle trailer side panel
articulated from below, including:


an assembly (11) for controlling the movement of the side
panel (2), including a so-called side-panel cylinder (16),

connected to the said side panel and to the remainder of the
trailer (1), single-acting, having a control chamber (18)

which decreases in volume when the side panel drops (opens)
whilst it is adapted, by the introduction of pressurized fluid

into the said control chamber, to impel the side panel to rise
until it is in the closed position;
an assembly (20; 20') for locking the side panel, including

a latch (21; 21') forced by an elastic means (28; 28') towards
a locking position in which it is able to hold a finger (26;

26') fixed to the side panel (2) when the latter is in the
closed position, the said latch and the said finger being

designed to cooperate so that, at the end of closure of the
side panel, if the latch is in the locking position, the

finger comes up against the latch and drives it counter to the
elastic means as far as a limit position in which the latch is

able to return to the locking position, then hooking onto the
finger; and having a so-called locking cylinder (24; 24'),

connected to the latch and to the remainder of the trailer,
and having a control chamber (29; 29') whose volume decreases

when the latch goes towards the locking position, being
designed, through the introduction of pressurized fluid into

the said control chamber, to impel the latch to move away from
the locking position to a position in which it no longer holds

the said finger, in order to enable the side panel to open;
and
a fluid control valve (40), connected to the control chamber
(18) of the side-panel cylinder (16), to the control chamber 

(29; 29') of the locking cylinder (24; 24'), to a pump (41)
and to a reservoir (42), allowing a position of opening of the

side panel in which the control chamber (29; 29') of the
locking cylinder (24; 24') is connected to the pump (41)

whilst the control chamber (18) of the side-panel cylinder
(16) is connected to the reservoir (42), and allowing a

position of closure of the side panel in which the control
chamber (18) of the side-panel cylinder (16) is connected to

the pump whilst the control chamber (29; 29') of the locking
cylinder (24; 24') is connected to the reservoir (42),
characterised in that
 the said latch (21; 21') is adapted, by
the introduction of pressurized fluid into the control chamber

(29; 29') of the locking cylinder (24; 24'), to be driven
beyond the said position in which it no longer holds the

finger (26; 26'), and then to come back into contact with the
side panel (2) in order to impel it to open at a predetermined

angle from the closed position.
System according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
said fluid control valve (40) allows, between the said

positions of opening and closure of the side panel, a neutral
position in which the control chamber (18) of the side-panel

cylinder (16) and the control chamber (29; 29') of the locking
cylinder (24; 24') are each isolated.
System according to either one of Claims 1 or 2,

characterised in that
, in the position of opening of the side
panel, a restriction (44) is provided on the path between the

reservoir (42) and the control chamber (18) of the side-panel
cylinder (16).
System according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that
 the elastic means (28; 28') which acts
on the latch (21; 21') is disposed in the locking cylinder

(24; 24'). 
System according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 the said latch (21) has, seen from the
side, the shape of a Γ articulated on the said remainder of

the trailer at the top of its vertical leg whilst it is
articulated on the said locking cylinder (24) below the

horizontal leg by virtue of a fastener connected to the
vertical leg, this latch (21) cooperating with the said finger

(26) through its horizontal leg whilst it cooperates with the
side panel, in order to impel it to open, through a part of

its vertical leg situated below the said fastener.
System according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 the said latch (21') has, seen from the
side, the shape of a Γ articulated on the said remainder of

the trailer at the top of its vertical leg whilst it is
articulated on the said locking cylinder below the horizontal

leg by virtue of a fastener connected to the base of the
vertical leg, this latch cooperating with the said finger

(26') through the horizontal leg whilst it cooperates with the
side panel (2), in order to impel it to open, through a part

of its vertical leg situated above the said fastener.
System according to either one of Claims 5 or 6,

characterised in that
 the said side panel (2) articulated from
below is bordered on each side by a post (3, 4) having a

housing (31; 31') for a said latch (21; 21') and its said
locking cylinder (24; 24'), the said housing (31; 31') being

deeper than the overall thickness of the post (3, 4), with the
latch (21; 21') articulated on the post at a part of the

housing which projects on the internal side of the trailer
(1).
System according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the
said side panel (2) extends over the entire length of the

trailer (1), the front post (3) being equipped with a latch
(21) as 
characterised in
 Claim 5, and the rear post (4)
equipped with a latch (21') as 
characterised in
 Claim 6. 
System according to any one of Claims 1 to 8,

characterised in that
 the said assembly controlling the
movement of the side panel (11) includes:


a lever (12) articulated on the trailer about a first
articulation axis (13);
a link (10) articulated at a first end on the side panel
about a second articulation axis (9), and at a second end on

the said lever (12) about a third articulation axis (14);
the said side-panel cylinder (16), which is disposed in a
free space below the base (5) of the trailer (1), and

articulated at a first end on the lever (12) about a fourth
articulation axis (15) and at a second end on the trailer

about a fifth articulation axis (17);

the said first to fifth articulation axes being parallel to
the axis (6) of articulation of the side panel on the trailer.
