<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a seat, in particular for vehicles, with an upholstered element made of foamed plastic which has a support element (7) consisting of an open-cell, elastic plastics foam and a flame-resistant covering material (15) which are connected to one another, in particular bonded at certain points. A covering layer (19) made of a woven cloth or knitted fabric or nonwoven is attached, in particular bonded, onto an underside of the supporting element (7) lying opposite the seat faces (14).

<CLAIMS>
Vehicle seat (2, 3) with upholstery (4) made from expanded plastic, having a supporting
body (7) made from an open-cell elastic plastic foam, which is covered with a flame-resistant

cover material (15) at least in the region of a seating surface (14) and with a
flame-retardant or non-flammable covering layer (19) in the region of a bottom face

(18, 59) opposing the seating surface (14), characterised in that the supporting body (7)
is bonded or expanded onto the bottom face (18, 59) opposing the seating surface (14),

directly onto a covering layer (19) made from a woven fabric or knitted fabric or
matting and in that the covering layer (19) overlaps edges (20 to 23) between the

bottom face (18, 59) and a side face (17) and optionally between the side face (17) and
the seating surface (14).
Seat according to claim 1, characterised in that an intermediate layer (9) is arranged
between the supporting body (7) and the covering layer (19).
Seat according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that individual regions of the covering
layer (19) on the side facing away from supporting body (7) are provided with a

reinforcing bearing (25).

intermediate layer (9) consists of a netting or fabric or lattice of threads and/or fibres

or a flame-retardant material and the mesh width of the lattice or fabric or netting is
approximately 0.5 to 8 mm, preferably 3 mm.
Seat according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised in that the fibres
or threads (10, 11) are glass and/or ceramic and/or metal and/or carbon.
Seat according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
supporting body (7) is made in a single piece and the expanded plastic of the

supporting body (7) is impregnated with a powdered flame retardant (8).
Seat according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised in that the
supporting body (7) is made from a plastic foam with a uniform volumetric weight of
