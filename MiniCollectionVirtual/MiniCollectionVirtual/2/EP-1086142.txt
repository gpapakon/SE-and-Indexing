<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a highly region-selective method for preparing a cyclodextrin C-6 monosulphonyl derivative in particular  beta -cyclodextrin, which consists in reacting said cyclodextrin with a sulphonylation agent in an aqueous alkaline solution in the presence of a metal salt capable of forming a co-ordinating complex with the cyclodextrin secondary hydroxyl groups, and at the end of the reaction in recuperating said cyclodextrin C-6 monosuphonyl derivative from the reaction mixture. Cyclodextrin monosulphonyl derivatives are particularly useful as starting materials for obtaining monofunctionalised cyclodextrin derivatives.

Regioselective method for preparing a cyclodextrin
derivative monosulfonylated at C-6, in which said

cyclodextrin is caused to react with a sulfonylation
agent, in an alkaline aqueous solution, in the presence

of a metal salt able to form a coordination complex with
the secondary hydroxyl groups of the cyclodextrin, and

after the reaction said cyclodextrin derivative
monosulfonylated at C-6 is recovered from the reaction

mixture.
Method according to claim 1, in which said
cyclodextrin is chosen from among the α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrins.
Method according to claim 1, in which said
sulfonylation agent is chosen from among the aryl- and

alkyl- sulfonyl chlorides, said aryl group optionally
being substituted by one or more substituents.
Method according to claim 3, in which said
sulfonylation agent is paratoluene-sulfonyl chloride

(tosyl chloride).
Method according to any of claims 1 to 4, in which
said metal salt able to form a co-ordination complex with

the secondary hydroxyl groups of cyclodextrin is chosen
from among lithium, copper and lead salts.
Method according to claim 5, in which said metal
salt is chosen from among the nitrate and sulphate of

said metal. 
Method according to claim 6, in which said salt is
copper sulfate.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 7, in which
said alkaline aqueous solution has a pH of 12.7 to 12.8.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 8, in which
the reaction is produced by addition and mixing of

reagents and maintaining the reaction mixture at a
temperature of 15 to 30°C for a period of 3 to 6 hours in

order to continue and complete the reaction.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 9, in
which after the reaction, in order to recover said

cyclodextrin derivative monosulfonylated at C-6, the
reaction mixture is neutralized to precipitate the metal

salt, the precipitate of metal salt is separated, the
aqueous solution obtained of cyclodextrin derivative

monosulfonylated at C-6 that is free of metal salt is
concentrated, and the cyclodextrin derivative

monosulfonylated at C-6 which crystallizes is collected
and optionally purified.
