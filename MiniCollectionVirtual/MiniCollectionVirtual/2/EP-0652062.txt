<ABSTRACT>
A core box for producing core bodies for the fabrication of hollow bodies has two shell moulds (1,2), each of which has an outer base body (5,13) on the inner face of which an abrasion-resistant synthetic-resin layer (6,14) is deposited, and which can be placed one against the other at a joint face (parting plane) (3) of the core box to form a hollow space corresponding to the core body. In order to improve the core box in such a way that no expensive finishing and after-treatment operations on the cores or core bodies fabricated in the core box are required any more, the abrasion-resistant synthetic-resin layer (6) of one shell mould (1) has, in the region of its joint edge (7), a recess (8) in which is arranged a resilient lip (10) which projects beyond the abrasion-resistant synthetic-resin layer (6) in the circumferential direction of the core box.

<CLAIMS>
Core box for the production of core bodies for the
manufacture of hollow bodies, having two shell moulds (1,

2), each of which has an outer primary body (5, 13), on the
inner face of which an abrasion-resistant synthetic resin

coating (6, 14) is applied, and which can be placed against
one another in a dividing plane (3) of the core box with the

formation of a cavity (4) corresponding to the core body,
characterised in that the abrasion-resistant synthetic resin

coatings (6, 14) of the two shell moulds (1, 2) each have in
the region of their dividing edges (7, 15) a recess (8, 16)

in which a resilient lip (10, 19) is arranged, the resilient
lip (10) of the one shell mould (1) projecting in the

circumferential direction of the core box beyond the
abrasion-resistant synthetic resin coating (6) of the shell

mould (1) and the free end face of the resilient lip (19) of
the other shell mould (2) being flush with the corresponding

end face of the abrasion-resistant synthetic resin coating
(14) of the other shell mould (2).
Core box according to claim 1, wherein each resilient
lip (10, 19) consists of a suitable synthetic resin.
Core box according to claim 1 or 2, wherein each recess
(8, 16) or each lip (10, 19) has a dovetail portion (9, 17

and 11, 18) remote from the dividing edge.
