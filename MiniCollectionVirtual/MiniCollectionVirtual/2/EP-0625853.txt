<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a moving image encoder and decoder
for performing encoding and transmission of a moving image in a more
efficient manner.A regional based coding method is known for dividing an image into
regions by means of conducting an edge detection process on the image or a
process in which portions of uniform motion are integrated; forming motion
parameters which indicate how each of the aforementioned regions is modified
with respect to the original image; and transmitting the coded motion
parameters ("Object-Oriented Analysis-Synthesis Coding of Moving Images",
H. G. Musmann, et al., pp. 117-138, Signal Processing, Elsvier Science
Publishers B.V., 1989). According to conventional methods, in addition to
obtaining motion information in the aforementioned manner, the contour
information of each region is coded at each time period and then transmitted
to the decoder. Fig. 8 is a block diagram showing a construction of a
conventional moving image encoder for encoding and transmitting motion
parameters and contour information. As shown in Fig. 8, this moving image
encoder comprises a differentiator 1, discrete cosine transform 2, quantizer 3,
inverse quantizer 4, inverse discrete cosine transform 5, adder 6, frame
memory 7, motion compensation 8, contour extractor 9, and motion
parameter extractor 10.In the aforementioned structure, the input image In to be coded and
transmitted is initially inputted into differentiator 1. The difference between
input image In and prediction image Pn is calculated by means of this
differentiator 1, and a differential image Δn is subsequently outputted.
Prediction image Pn will be mentioned hereafter. Subsequently, with regard 
to this differential image Δn, direct transforms such as discrete cosine
transform is conducted by means of discrete cosine transform 2 and the
resultant transform coefficient Cn is then outputted. This transform
coefficient Cn is quantized by means of quantizer 3 and then sent to the
receiving set as coded information Dn. This coded information Dn is sent to
both the receiving set, and inverse quantizer 4 where it is quantized. Inverse
discrete cosine transform is conducted on this inverse quantized information
by means of an inverse discrete cosine transform 5, and quantization
differential signal QΔn is then outputted. Between a quantized differential
image QΔn and differential image Δn, a difference equivalent to the quantized
error generated during the quantization of quantizer 3 exists. The quantized
differential image QΔn
