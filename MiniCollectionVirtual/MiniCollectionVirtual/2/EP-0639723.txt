<ABSTRACT>
In a viscous fluid coupling (1), which includes a labyrinth 
device (19,20) for transmitting rotational torque from an 

input member (2) to an output member (4) through viscous fluid 
and a temperature sensing bi-metal spiral spring 

element (18) for controlling the flow of viscous fluid 
toward the labyrinth device (19,20), a part of the spring 

element (18) radially outward of where the stress is concentrated, 
is welded (28,32) to a holder plate (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a viscous
fluid coupling according to the preamble of the patent claim 1.A conventional viscous fluid coupling is seen
in Japanese Patent Laid-Open (KOKAI) publication No.
234931/1991 and includes an input member having a
rotatable shaft and a rotatable disc-shaped rotor
secured to the shaft; an output member rotatable with
respect to an axis of the shaft and having a casing
rotatably supported on the shaft and a cover secured
at its outer periphery to the casing to define a
hollow interior space, the rotor being housed in the
hollow interior space; a partition plate positioned
in the hollow interior space between the cover and
the rotor for dividing the hollow interior space into
a working chamber and a fluid storage chamber, the
partition plate secured to the cover and having
apertures for allowing the viscous fluid to flow from
the storage chamber to the working chamber; a valve
plate for closing and opening the apertures 
formed in the partition plate and secured on a rod
which is supported on the cover; a temperature
responsive bi-metal spiral spring element secured to
the rod for actuating the valve plate to a position
to open the apertures formed in the partition plate
and a position to close the apertures formed in the
partition plate; labyrinth device provided at least
between the rotatable rotor and the casing for
transferring rotation of the rotor to the casing; and
a holder plate secured to the cover and fixedly
holding an outer periphery of the spiral spring element.In this prior case, a welding point to secure
the bi-metal spiral spring element to the holder
plate is located near a part of the spiral spring
element which will be subjected to a concentrated
stress. A disadvantage in this type of the coupling
is the decrease in the strength of the bi-metal spiral
spring element due to thermal effect of the welding
process.Specifically, the location of the welding
point near the concentrated part of the stress in the
bi-metal spiral spring element will amplify such the
disadvantage. The viscous fluid coupling of the preamble
of claim 1 is disclosed in document EP-A-0 097 423.This known coupling has a bi-metal spiral
spring element secured to the rod for actuating the valve plate to a position to open the
apertures and a position to close these apertures. This spring
element has, furthermore, a readially extending portion at its
other periphery and a tip end portion thereof being welded to
a part of a holder plate secured to the cover. This part of
the holder
