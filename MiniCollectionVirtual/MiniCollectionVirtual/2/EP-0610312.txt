<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for the generation of a foaming dispersion of bubbles in a carbonated beverage or other gas-containing liquid packaged in a can (120) or other sealed container. An initially liquid-free device (9) having an internal chamber with an inlet/outlet valve (130/150) assembly is placed in the can, which is then filled with the beverage. The can is sealed and pasteurised, which raises the internal pressure in the can to force some of the gasified beverage into the device through the inlet valve. The outlet valve holds the quantity of beverage in the internal chamber until the can is opened, whereupon the depressurisation of the can opens the outlet valve to discharge the internal chamber through an orifice to initiate seed bubbles which form a head on the beverage. The method and apparatus are particularly applicable to producing a head on fermented alcoholic beverages to simulate draught beverages.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device and a method for
generation of a foaming dispersion of bubbles within a
beverage or other liquid packaged within a sealed,
non-resealable can or other container, and to a
beverage package incorporating a beverage frothing
device. This invention is especially although not
exclusively suited to use with canned alcoholic
beverages such as beer, ale, porter, stout or lager,
but may also be used with non-alcoholic "soft" drinks.A device and method for the production of a foamy
dispersion of bubbles or "head" is desirable in canned
beverages such as beer, ale, porter, stout or lager
since these beverages tend to have a diminished head
when dispensed from a can, in comparison to beverages
dispensed on draught. Head generation is assisted by
the release of gas dissolved in the beverage when it is
depressurised whether by being drawn from a keg as with
draught beverage, or by the opening of a can or bottle.
In draught beverages this head generation is enhanced
by the pressurisation of the kegs with carbon dioxide
(CO2), nitrogen (N2) or other suitable inert gases,
combined with the use of foaming devices in the 
dispense equipment. Thus draught beverages usually
release more bubbles during depressurisation caused by
dispensing and have more dense, longer lasting heads
than beverages dispensed from cans or bottles.Prior art has addressed these problems by various
methods.Disclosure has been made of various moulded inserts
which are wholly or partially gas-filled and discharge
their gas (or gas and beverage) through an orifice in
the insert upon depressurisation of the can. The
energy released from the insert upon depressurisation
may be temperature sensitive causing inconsistent head
production at varying temperatures. At room
temperature this may result in excessive foaming,
spillage and loss of beverage.Alternative approaches to the problem include cans
modified to comprise one chamber for beverage and one
for gas that mixes with the beverage when the can is
opened. This sophisticated design of can leads to high
costs and could prove commercially unviable.Various intermediate systems have been proposed wherein
gas chambers are incorporated in can lids or bases. In
addition chemical methods of inducing a head have been
disclosed but it is unclear to what extent these affect
the taste of the beverage.According to a first aspect of the present invention
there is provided a device for generating a foaming
dispersion of bubbles in a fluid surrounding the
exterior of said device,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device for generating a foaming dispersion of
bubbles in a fluid surrounding the exterior of said

device, said fluid comprising a liquid having gas
dissolved therein, said device being characterised in

that it comprises an internal chamber provided with
valve means adapted to admit some of said fluid

surrounding said exterior of said device through said
valve means and into said chamber when the pressure of

said surrounding fluid exceeds the internal pressure of
said chamber by a first predetermined amount, thereby

to establish a reserve of pressurised fluid within said
chamber, said valve means being further adapted to

release said reserve of pressurised fluid from said
chamber to pass outwardly via orifice means into said

fluid surrounding said exterior of said device when
said internal pressure of said chamber exceeds the

pressure of said surrounding fluid by a second
predetermined amount, said orifice means being

dimensioned to cause the outward passage of fluid
therethrough to generate a foaming dispersion of

bubbles in said surrounding fluid.
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in
that said orifice means is so dimensioned as to

depressurise said fluid passing outwardly through said
orifice means in a manner which causes the gas

dissolved in said liquid to come out of solution in the
form of a plurality of foam-generating seed bubbles.
A device as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
characterised in that said valve means comprises

functionally separate inlet valve means and outlet
valve means respectively adapted for the admission and 

release of fluid to and from said chamber.
A device as claimed in claim 3, characterised in
that said inlet valve means comprises a poppet valve.
A device as claimed in claim 3, characterised in
that said inlet valve means comprises a one-way fluid

valve as described in British Patent Specification
GB1066508.
A device as claimed in claim 3, characterised in
that said inlet valve means comprises a diaphragm

having at least one slit therein, said diaphragm partly
bounding said chamber and being substantially closed to

the outward passage of fluid therethrough, said
diaphragm being inwardly deformable by external

pressure to open said at least one slit for the passage
therethrough of fluid into said chamber.
A device as claimed in any of claims 2-6,
characterised in that said outlet valve means comprises

a differential valve.
A device as claimed in claim 7, characterised in
that said differential valve has the form of an outer

passage normally closed by a plug having a
chamber-facing inner area acted upon by the internal

pressure of said chamber, said plug further having an
exterior-facing outer area acted upon by the pressure

of said fluid surrounding the exterior of said device,
said outer area being greater than said inner area by

an extent which maintains said outlet passage plugged
until said internal pressure of said chamber exceeds

the pressure of said surrounding fluid by said second
predetermined amount thereupon to cause or allow said 

outlet passage to come unplugged to release said
reserve of pressurised fluid from said chamber.
A method of generating a foaming dispersion of
bubbles in a fluid, said fluid comprising a liquid

having gas dissolved therein, said method being
characterised in that it comprises the steps of

providing a device as claimed in any of claims 1-8,
submerging said device in said fluid to surround the

exterior of said device with said fluid, pressurising
said surrounding fluid above the internal pressure of

said chamber in said device by at least said first
predetermined amount thereby cause some of said

surrounding fluid to be admitted through said valve
means of said device and into said chamber to establish

a reserve of pressurised fluid within said chamber,
maintaining said device submerged in said fluid and

maintaining the pressurisation of said fluid
surrounding the exterior of said device above the

initial pressure thereof by an amount that
substantially obviates premature discharge of a

substantial proportion of said reserve of pressurised
fluid from said device, said pressurisation of said

surrounding fluid being maintained until the generation
of a foaming dispersion of bubbles is required and

thereupon depressurising the fluid surrounding the
exterior of said device to a pressure below the

internal pressure of said chamber by at least said
second predetermined amount to cause the outward

passage of said reserve of fluid through said orifice
means whereby to generate a foaming dispersion of

bubbles in said surrounding fluid.
A method of packaging a beverage in a sealed
container for the subsequent generation of a foaming 

dispersion of bubbles in said beverage upon said
container being unsealed, said beverage comprising a

liquid having gas dissolved therein, said method being
characterised in that it comprises the steps of

providing a sealable container which is initially open,
unsealed and empty of liquid; providing a device as

claimed in any of claims 1-8; emplacing said device in
said open container; prior or subsequent to the

emplacement of said device in said open container,
adding a quantity of said beverage to said open

container sufficient to submerge said device when
emplaced in said container and to surround the exterior

of said device with said beverage; closing and sealing
said container with said quantity of beverage and said

submerged device therein; and temporarily elevating the
temperature of at least the contents of said closed and

sealed container by an amount to cause a concomitant
increase in the pressure of said beverage surrounding
