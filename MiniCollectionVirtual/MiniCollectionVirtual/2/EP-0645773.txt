Method of updating a memory, in which the
memory (M) is divided into a plurality (m) of memory

locations (M1, ..., Mm) which can respectively contain
the last update relating to an item of information and

various previous updates, this method being
characterized in that:


each type of information to be updated is assigned
a certain degree of importance lying between 2 and

m, with m 
>
 2,
in order to update an item of information having a
given degree of importance, this update is

allocated a group of memory locations the number
of which depends on this degree, this group being

positioned after the group of locations containing
the last update, and the various updates are

written cyclically to this group, thus keeping
only a limited number of last updates which

depends on the degree of importance of the
information.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, in order to update an item of information with

degree of importance 2, this update is allocated a
group of two memory locations and the sequence of the

various updates of this information is written
cyclically to this group of 2 memory locations, thus

keeping only the last two updates of the information.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, in order to update an item of information having 

the highest degree of importance (m), this update is
allocated a group of locations comprising all the

locations (m) of the memory, and the sequence of the
various updates is written cyclically to the memory,

thus keeping the 
m
 last updates of the information.
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the items of information to be

updated are information connected with a transaction.
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the information to be updated is a debit, or an

accumulation of debits, or a credit, or an accumulation
of credi
ts.
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the information to be updated is a balance.
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that it is applied to memory cards of

the electronic purse type.
Memory card employing the method according to
any one of Claims 1 to 7, this card comprising at least

one memory divided into a plurality (m) of memory
locations (M1, ..., Mm), this memory being controlled

by means for updating its contents, these means being
capable of receiving an information item and of having

the current value of the information written to a
suitable memory location, this card being characterized

in that it furthermore comprises means capable of
recognizing the degree of importance of the information

received and of limiting the writing of the various
updates of this information to a group of memory

locations the number of which depends on the said
degree of importance.
