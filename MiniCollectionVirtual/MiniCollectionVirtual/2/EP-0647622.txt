<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a hydrazone compound of the formula I: 

wherein R¹ and R² are the same or different and are independently hydrogen, C₁-C₂ 
alkyl, C₁-C₂ alkoxy, methoxymethyl or cyanomethyl, with the proviso that the R¹ and R² 

are not simultaneously hydrogen; R³ is trifluoromethyl or methyl; and X is halogen, and 
an insecticide containing the hydrazone compound as an active ingredient. The hydrazone 

compound has good insecticidal activity and lower acute toxicity to mammals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydrazone compound and an insecticide 
containing the same as an active ingredient. An insecticidal benzophenone-N',N'-monoacylhydrazone is disclosed in 
US-A-4,344,893. However, the compound is not always satisfactory for its 
insecticidal activity and toxicity to mammals. Thus, it is the object of the present invention to provide 
a compound having good insecticidal activity and lower 
acute toxicity to mammals. This object has been achieved by the surprising finding 
that particular hydrazone compounds have good insecticidal 
activity and lower acute toxicity to mammals. That is, the present invention provides a hydrazone compound of formula I: 
wherein R¹ and R² are the same or different and are independently hydrogen, C₁-C₂ 
alkyl, C₁-C₂ alkoxy, methoxymethyl or cyanomethyl, with the proviso that the R¹ and R² 
are not simultaneously hydrogen; R³ is trifluoromethyl or methyl; and X is halogen, and 
an insecticide containing the hydrazone compound as an active ingredient.  For the substituents R¹ and R², C₁-C₂ alkyl means methyl 
or ethyl, and C₁-C₂ alkoxy means methoxy or ethoxy. The 
substituent X is halogen, namely chlorine, bromine, fluorine 
or iodine. The hydrazone compound of the present invention can be produced by the 
following production process A or B. The production process A comprises reacting a compound of the formula II: 
wherein R¹ and R³ are each as defined above, with a compound of the formula III: 
wherein R² is as defined above; Z is chlorine, bromine, a group of the formula:
 
-OCOR², C₁-C₂ alkoxy (i.e., methoxy, ethoxy) or hydroxyl, with the proviso that 
when Z is hydroxyl, R² is not C₁-C₂ alkoxy. When the compound III is an activated carboxylic acid derivative, i.e., Z is 
chlorine, bromine or a group of the formula: -OCOR², the reaction of the compound II 
with the compound III is usually carried out in the presence of a base. Examples of the base are organic bases including tertiary alkylamines such 
as triethylamine, ethyldiisopropylamine and tributylamine, tertiary dialkylarylamines such 
as N,N-diethylaniline, heteroarylamines such as pyridine compounds (e.g., pyridine,  
 
picoline and 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine); inorganic bases including alkali metal 
hydroxides and hydrides, such as sodium hydroxide and sodium hydride, and alkali metal 
carbonates such as potassium carbonate; and organometallic bases such as butyl lithium 
and lithium diisopropylamide. The amount of the base to be used is usually 1 or more moles to 1 mole of the
