<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to fuses for an integrated circuit. Such fuses are useful for irreversibly preventing access to certain regions of the integrated circuit. They serve particularly in applications for memory cards. According to the invention, a fuse is provided consisting of an NP junction of shallow depth (12, 11) covered by a metal contact (22), the semiconducting region covered over not being heavily doped. In order to blow the fuse, the junction is forward-biased with a current which is sufficient to allow diffusion of metal as far as the junction, which short-circuits it. Detection is carried out also by forward-biasing the junction, but with a low current or a low voltage. Detection can also be carried out in reverse bias.
