<ABSTRACT>
A collapsible material handling container (10) of 
the type for packaging, shipping and inventorying goods 

including a base (12), a pair of sidewalls (14), and a pair 
of end walls (16). Each of the walls (14,16) are hingedly 

connected to the base (12) and moveable between a collapsed 
position wherein the walls (14,16) are folded one on top 

of the other and an upright position wherein the walls (14,16) 
extend vertically upward from the base (12) and 

adjacent walls (14,16) are interlocked together to define 
a smooth planer interior surface of the container (10). 
The interlocking system includes terminal portions (52) disposed on 
the side walls (14) 

and having tabs (54) extending therefrom, and corner portions (58) 
disposed on the end walls (16) and having sockets (60) for receiving the 

tabs (58). 
The base (12) includes ramping surfaces (72) for supporting at least 
one of the end walls (16) when collapsed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a material handling 
container of the type for packaging, shipping, and 
inventorying goods. More specifically, the invention 
relates to a reusable, molded thermoplastic container which 
is collapsible when empty and stackable in either the 
collapsed or upright position in order to reduce the space 
required to ship or inventory goods stored in the 
container. Material handling containers used for packaging, 
shipping and inventorying goods are well known in the art. 
For example, United States Patent No. 4,591,065 issued to 
Foy on March 27, 1986; United States Patent No. 4,917,255 
issued to Foy et al. on April 17, 1990; United States 
Patent No. 4,923,079 issued to Foy; United States Patent 
No. 4,674,647 issued to Gynge et al. on June 23, 1987; 
United States Patent No. 4,775,068 issued to Reiland et al.  
 
on October 4, 1988; and United States Patent No. 5,094,356 
issued to Miller on March 10, 1992 all disclose collapsible 
containers having a base and four walls which are hingedly 
connected to the base. The walls are moveable between a 
collapsed position where the walls are folded one on top of 
the other and an upright position where the walls extend 
vertically upward from the base to define an interior of 
the container. Containers of the type disclosed in the patents 
listed above are made of plastic and are generally the 
largest of their class having dimensions ranging from 
approximately 40-45 inches in width, x approximately 48 
inches in length, x approximately 25-39 inches in height. 
Typically, in the prior art, each wall and base of such 
containers are molded separately using a structural foam 
molding process. Mold tooling costs are an important 
factor in the design of a collapsible container. Reducing 
the number of tools required to mold the walls and base of 
the container can lower the up-front capital expenditures 
and therefore the cost of the container. However, it is 
not uncommon that five sets of tools are required to mold 
containers in the prior art. For example, the container 
disclosed by Foy et al. in their '255 patent includes a 
pair of sidewalls and a pair of end walls, each of which is  
 
hingedly connected to the base along a different horizontal 
plane spaced vertically from the horizontal planes defined 
by the three hinges of the other walls. The walls can thus 
be folded over into overlapping vertical spaced 
relationship with respect to one another when collapsed as 
shown in Figures 12-14 of this patent. While Foy et al.
