<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to flexible pouches (1) and methods for 
making them. More specifically, said pouches (1) incorporates ridges 

(6,7) so as to provide at the same time a pop up opening and flow guiding 
features to ease the pouring of the product contained in said pouches 

(1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to flexible packaging pouches 
and a method for making same. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to flexible pouches which are 
provided with a pop up opening and flow guiding features to 
ease the pouring of their content. Many forms of containers, especially stand-up plastic 
containers used as packages for receiving dry, powdered, 
granular or even liquid commodities have been extensively 
described in the art as well as the methods of making them. Representative of the prior art are the plastic pouches 
disclosed in US-3 380 646 or EP-A-0 334 242 which disclose 
containers of plastic material, of the type produced by 
welding and severing sheets or tubes of plastic material at 
spaced locations, and methods for making same. However, 
the use of such pouches for packaging dry or liquid  
 
commodities is affected by the disadvantage that said 
pouches offer no particular features for easing the 
dispensing of the contained commodities by the consumer 
after said pouches are cut open. More specifically, 
after having opened such a pouch by cutting one of its top 
corners, the front and the back sidewall panels of said 
pouch tend to collapse. Indeed, when inclining said pouch 
to pour its content, in most cases its content will not be 
poured in an acceptable manner from a consumer viewpoint. 
The content of said pouch will be first retained by said 
collapsed front and back sidewall panels and then suddenly 
dispensed, creating thereby important splashes which 
constitute a disadvantage of the use of said pouch. In 
order to avoid this, the front and the back sidewall panels 
collapse once a top corner is cut open; the consumer has to 
insert his fingers into the pouch to separate said front 
and back sidewall panels of said pouch. An object of the present invention is to alleviate the 
above problem, by ensuring a smooth dispensing of the 
contained commodity, after the pouch has been cut open. Flexible packaging pouches having means to self-expand said 
pouches after opening have been described for instance in 
US-5 184 896. The flexible pouches disclosed in said '896 
patent allow said pouches to remain open. However, said 
'896 patent does not disclose specific features to ease the 
pouring of a pouch's content. It is thus another object of the present invention to 
provide flow guiding features on the flexible pouch opening 
region so as to facilitate pouring of the product from said 
pouch. It has now been found that these objects can be efficiently

<CLAIMS>
A flexible pouch (1) having front (2) and back (3) 
sidewall panels superimposed upon one another and 

sealed together along their peripheral edges (4) to 
form a closed pouch structure, said pouch having also 

an opening region (5) characterized in that each of 
said front (2) or back (3) sidewall panels comprise 

at least one ridge wherein the ridge (6) of the front 
sidewall panel (2) corresponds to the ridge (7) of 

the back sidewall panel (3) and wherein said ridges 
emerge into the opening region (5) so as to pop open 

when said opening region is opened. 
A flexible pouch according to claim 1 wherein the 
opening region (5) is a corner and wherein said 

ridges (6) and (7) located on each front (2) and back 
(3) sidewall panels run towards the apex of said 

corner so as to create a pour spout shape that pops 
open when said corner is opened. 
A flexible pouch according to claims 1 or 2 wherein 
said pouch is a stand-up pouch, preferably formed 

from two sidewall panels and a bottomwall panel 
formed from a gusset. 
A pouch according to any of the preceding claims 
wherein said opening region (5) comprises on either 

the front (2) or the back (3) sidewall panel or both 
a printed cutting line (8) to indicate where to cut 

open said pouch. 
A pouch according to any of the preceding claims 
wherein said opening region (5) comprises as an 

opening means a line of weakness (8) on said front 
(2) and said back (3) sidewall panels. 
A pouch according to claim 5 wherein said line of 
weakness (8) terminates with a notch or a slit which 

aids in starting a tear along said line of weakness 
when the pouch is opened. 
A pouch according to any of the preceding claims 
wherein the material used is a multi-layered film 

with a first and second thermoplastic material, said 
first material which constitutes the exterior surface 

of said sidewall panels is made of polyamide having a 
thickness of from 0.5 to 60, whereas said second 

material which constitutes the interior surface of 
said sidewall panels is made of polyethylene having a 

thickness of from 5 to 170 micrometers. 
A pouch according to any of the preceding claims 
wherein said pouch has a handle (9). 
A method for making a flexible pouch according to 
claims 1-2 and claims 4-8, comprising the following 

steps of: 

a) supplying a web of a multi-layered film as 
described herein from a roll thereof. 

Alternatively, said film may be supplied 
directly, as fabricated, from an extrusion and/or 

laminated line. 
b) folding said film to form said front and back 
sidewall panels. 
c) heat sealing on said sidewall panels said ridges 
by pressing said film against a conventional 

sealing bar having desired ridge shape and 
configuration 
d) applying conventional sealing bars to seal said 
sidewall panels together along their peripheral 

lateral edges. 
e) severing said pouches from each other by a knife 
or a cutter. 
A method according to claim 9 for the manufacture of 
a pouch according to claim 3, which comprises the 

additional steps of: 

supplying from a second smaller roll another film 
to form a bottom gusset wall which is disposed 

and folded inwardly between said sidewall panels. 
applying of heat, by the use of shoe or bar-like 
members, to the lower portion of said gusset wall 

and the lower portion of said sidewall panels so 
as to form the stand-up bottom of said pouch.
