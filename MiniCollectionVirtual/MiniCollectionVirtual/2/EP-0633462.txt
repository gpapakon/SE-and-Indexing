<DESCRIPTION>
A user guide titled "ImmunoCount User Guide," 
distributed by Ortho Diagnostics Systems, Inc., Raritan, 
New Jersey and relating to the invention disclosed herein 
is incorporated herein by reference and made a part of 
this application. Worldwide, the number of individuals infected with 
the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) continues to rise. 
The World Health Organization estimates over 30-40 million 
HIV+ cases by the year 2000. Progression of HIV disease 
to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) now takes, on 
average, a half-time of approximately 10 years in 
developed countries. These two factors combined result in 
an ever increasing need for better tools to monitor HIV 
disease progression. Understanding of the clinically important factors for 
monitoring HIV infection has increased significantly in 
the past few years. This increased understanding has lead 
the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to re-evaluate how 
the stages of HIV disease progression are to be 
classified. The CDC report concludes that absolute CD4⁺ 
T-Lymphocyte count (absolute CD4⁺ count) is the most 
important marker available to clinicians for staging 
purposes. Further, the report proposes that AIDS may be 
defined solely on the basis of absolute CD4⁺ count when  
 
it falls below 200. Thus, the CDC has expanded the 
previous definition of AIDS beyond clinical presentation 
of "indicator diseases". Finally, the CDC report recommended that physicians 
use a patient's absolute CD4⁺ count to decide when to 
begin anti-retroviral and prophylactic therapies. 
Conflicting reports have been published concerning the 
benefits to be gained from prophylactic azidothymidine 
(AZT) therapy in individuals with CD4⁺ T-lymphocyte counts 
less than 500/uL. However, in clinical practice, 
initiation of AZT and other therapies is typically based 
upon absolute CD4⁺ count. Perhaps the most successful of 
the prophylactic therapies has been against Pneumocystis 
carini pneumonia (PCP), the most common opportunistic 
infection in AIDS. PCP prophylaxis is usually begun at an 
absolute CD4⁺ count below 200. Proper timing of 
prophylactic therapy is a major reason people infected 
with HIV are living longer, healthier lives than in the 
early days of the pandemic. Thus, resulting from both the 
CDC recommendation and accepted clinical practice, the 
absolute CD4⁺ count has become the most important 
criterion in the laboratory determination of AIDS. HIV has been strongly implicated as the causative 
agent of AIDS. The virus recognizes and

A method of selecting a subset of data from a 
matrix representing a data list comprising: 


(a) defining within the matrix a search region 
containing the subset; 
(b) locating a maximum density of data points 
within the search region; 
(c) locating a series of minimum densities of 
data points which define a boundary surrounding the 

maximum; and 
(d) isolating the data points within the region 
surrounded by the boundary points. 
A method of selecting from a matrix of data 
points representing cells, a set of data points 

representing a population of cells comprising: 

(a) specifying within the matrix, a search 
region which contains the population; 
(b) locating within the search region, a peak 
point which represents a maximum density of data points 

within the population; 
(c) locating a series of boundary points 
surrounding the peak point which represent minimum 

densities of data points surrounding the peak point; 
(d) generating a polygon defined by the 
boundary points surrounding the data points representing 

the population. 
The method of Claim 2, wherein the peak point is 
located by dividing the search region into discrete 

subregions and determining which subregion includes a 
maximum density of data points. 
The method of Claim 3, wherein the subregions are 
grouped in 3 X 3 blocks and the peak point is located by 

determining which block includes the subregion with the 
maximum density of data points. 
The method of Claim 2, wherein the boundary 
points are located by sequentially determining the minimum 

density of data points on successive radial projections 
from the peak point. 
The method of Claim 5 wherein the radial 
projections are at radial intervals of 10°. 
A method of isolating from a flow cytometry 
cytogram matrix, a set of population data points 

corresponding to a specific population of cells for 
further analysis, comprising: 


(a) defining a search region, within the 
cytogram matrix, which includes the population data; 
(b) dividing the search region into discrete 
subregions; 
(c) determining the density of population data 
points within each subregion; 
(d) locating a peak point in the center of a 

subregion having the highest density of data points; 
(e) determining a point of minimum density along 
each of a series of radial projections from the peak 

point; 
(f) locating a boundary point at each of the 
minimum density points; 
(g) defining a polygon which connects the 
boundary points and surrounds the population data points; 

and 
(h) subtracting the population data within the 
polygon from the cytogram matrix data. 
In a flow cytometry system for optically 
analyzing a sample in which data points representing cells 

in the sample are aggregated in a matrix based on selected 
optical parameters, a method of isolating a group of data 

points representing cells in an identified population, 
comprising: 


(a) specifying within the matrix, a search 
region which contains the identified population; 
(b) locating within the search region, a peak 
point which represents a maximum density of data points 

within the population; 
(c) locating a series of boundary points 
surrounding the peak point which represent minimum 

densities of data points surrounding the peak point; 
(d) generating a polygon defined by the 
boundary points; and 
(e) subtracting from the matrix the data points 
within the polygon.
