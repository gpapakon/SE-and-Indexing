<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides hybrid oligonucleotides having phosphorothioate or phosphorodithioate internucleotide linkages, and both deoxyribonucleosides and ribonucleosides or 2'-substituted ribonucleosides. Such hybrid oligonucleotides have superior properties of duplex formation with RNA, nuclease resistance, and RNase H activation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to synthetic oligonucleotides
that are useful for studies of gene expression and in the
antisense oligonucleotide therapeutic approach. More
particularly, the invention relates to synthetic
oligonucleotides that have improved qualities for such
applications resulting from modifications in the sugar
phosphate backbone of the oligonucleotides.The potential for the development of an antisense
oligonucleotide therapeutic approach was first suggested
in three articles published in 1977 and 1978. Paterson
et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74: 4370-4374 (1987)
discloses that cell-free translation of mRNA can be
inhibited by the binding of an oligonucleotide
complementary to the mRNA. Zamecnik and Stephenson,
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75: 280-284 and 285-288 (1978)
discloses that a 13-mer synthetic oligonucleotide that is
complementary to a part of the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)
genome inhibits RSV replication in infected chicken
fibroblasts and inhibits RSV-mediated transformation of
primary chick fibroblasts into malignant sarcoma cells.These early indications that synthetic
oligonucleotides can be used to inhibit virus propagation
and neoplasia have been followed by the use of synthetic
oligonucleotides to inhibit a wide variety of viruses.
Goodchild et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,806,463
discloses inhibition of Human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) by synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to
various regions of the HIV genome. Leiter et al., Proc. 
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 3430-3434 (1990) discloses
inhibition of influenza virus by synthetic
oligonucleotides. Agris at al., Biochemistry 25: 6268-6275
(1986) discloses the use of synthetic
oligonucleotides to inhibit Vesicular stomatitis virus
(VSV). Gao at al., Antimicrob. Agents chain. 34: 808-812
(1990) discloses inhibition of Herpes simplex virus by
synthetic oligonucleotides. Birg at al., Nucleic Acids
Res. 18: 2901-2908 (1990) discloses inhibition of Simian
virus (SV40) by synthetic oligonucleotides. Storey et
al., Nucleic Acids Res. 19: 4109-4114 (1991) discloses
inhibition of Human papilloma virus (HPV) by synthetic
oligonucleotides. The use of synthetic oligonucleotides
and their analogs as antiviral agents has recently been
extensively reviewed by Agrawal, Tibtech 10: 152-158
(1992).In addition, synthetic oligonucleotides have been
used to inhibit a variety of non-viral pathogens, as well
as to selectively inhibit the expression of certain
cellular genes.Thus, the utility of synthetic oligonucleotides as
agents to inhibit virus
