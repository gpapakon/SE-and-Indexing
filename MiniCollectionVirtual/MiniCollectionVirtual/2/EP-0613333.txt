<ABSTRACT>
In order to prevent deterioration in connecting reliability due to 
deformation and the like of semiconductors and circuit boards, it is 

necessary to have some elasticity incorporated with bump electrodes 
(14).

 
The composition of bump electrodes (14) disclosed by the present 

invention is to have resin particles (16) dispersed to high density in 
the metallic bump electrodes (14).

 
According to this composition, even when there are some variations of 

distribution in circuit board warp and bump electrode height, it has 
become possible to absorb the variations through elasticity presented by 

the bump electrodes (14) and to perform a low strain connection with a 
resultant enhancement in connecting reliability at high temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic components 
mounting/connecting package for mounting electronic components 
such as semiconductors and the like on circuit boards 
or film carriers and its fabrication method. It has been known for many years to connect bump electrodes 
of a semiconductor to patterning electrodes of a circuit 
board by press-bonding with an insulating resin placed 
between the semiconductor and the circuit board and this has 
been referred to as a microbump bonding method. 
With the help of Fig. 12, this microbump bonding method will 
be explained here. In Fig. 12(a), item 121 is a circuit board composed of 
glass, ceramics or the like, item 122 is a patterning electrode 
formed on the circuit board 121 and item 123 is a drop 
of a light setting insulation resin placed at a position on 
the circuit board where an LSI chip is to be mounted. 
Then, as illustrated in Fig. 12(b), a bump electrode 126 
formed on an aluminum electrode 125 of the LSI chip 124 is 
aligned in position with the patterning electrode 122. 
The bump electrode 126 is usually formed on the aluminum 
electrode 125 with a barrier-metal such as Ti/Pd/Au, Cr/Au 
or the like placed in between. 
The bump electrode 126 has been so far comprised of 
such a metallic material as gold, solder or the like and 
has been formed on the aluminum electrode 125 of the LSI  
 
chip 124 either directly by an electrolytic plating method 
or through a transferring method whereby metal bumps formed 
on a separate metal substrate are transferred to the surface 
of the aluminum electrode 125 of the LSI chip 124. In the next, as illustrated in Fig. 12(c), the LSI chip 124 
is applied with a pressing force through a pressure application 
tool 127. 
Then, the insulation resin 123 under the bump electrode 124 
is completely put aside towards the periphery and the bump 
electrode 124 is compressed to complete an electrical connection 
with the patterning electrode 122. 
Then, ultraviolet rays 128 are irradiated for curing 
the light setting insulation resin 123, as shown in 
Fig. 12(d). 
At this time, when the circuit board is formed of a transparent 
material such as glass, etc., the ultraviolet rays 
are irradiated from the back side of the circuit board 121 
and when the circuit board is not transparent, the ultraviolet 
ray irradiation is applied from the side where the LSI 
chip 124 is mounted. 
When curing of the resin is finished and the pressure application 
tool 127 is removed, the connection between the LSI 
chip 124 and the
