<ABSTRACT>
A chromium-base alloy steel 
powder for high-strength sinter with high 

tensile strength, high fatigue strength 
and high toughness suitable for the use 

as automotive parts, office automation 
equipment parts and the like. The steel 

powder comprises, on the weight basis, 
at most 0.1 % of carbon, at most 0.08 

% of manganese, 0.5-3 % of chromium, 
0.1-2 % of molybdenum, at most 0.01 % 

of sulfur, at most 0.01 % of phosphorus, 
at most 0.2 % of oxygen, and if 

necessary at least one member selected 
between 0.2-2.5 % of nickel and 0.5-2.5 

% of copper, the balance consisting of 
unavoidable impurities and iron. The 

sinter has a similar composition except 
that the carbon content is particularly 

restricted to 0.2-1.2 %. The production 
process comprises compacting the 

powder, sintering the compact at a 
temperature of 1,100 to 1,300 °C, and 

either immediately cooling the sinter 
at a cooling rate of 10-200 °C/min, or 

carburizing and heat treating the sinter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the art of powder
metallurgy and more particularly, to alloy steel powders
used to make sintered bodies which have high strength, high
fatigue strength and high toughness, sintered bodies, and a
method for manufacturing the sintered bodies.In general, the sintered body made by powder
metallurgy is advantageous in cost over ingot steels obtained
through forging and rolling steps and has wide utility as
parts of motor vehicles and office automation apparatus.
However, the sintered body has voids which are inevitably
formed during the course of its fabrication, thus leading to
the drawback that strength, fatigue strength and toughness
are low. In order to enlarge the range in use of the sintered
body, it is important to improve the strength, fatigue
strength and toughness. In order to improve the strength of sintered body,
Cr-Mn alloy steel powder has been hitherto used (Japanese
Patent Publication No. 58-10962 or US-A-4266974). Although Cr and Mn serve to
increase hardenability and thus, have the merit of high
strength after heat treatment, they are, respectively,
ready-to-oxidize elements, with the attendant drawback that
Cr-Mn composite oxide is formed to lower the fatigue strength
and toughness of the resultant sintered body.To avoid this, it is essential for the manufacture of
Cr-Mn alloy sintered bodies to sinter and reduce in an
atmosphere where an oxygen content is small and to use a
specific type of vacuum reduction furnace.The present applicant has already developed
(Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 4-165002) a Cr alloy steel
powder wherein the content of Mn is reduced and to which Nb
and V are added. Since the Mn content is reduced, the
severeness of the sintering atmosphere can be mitigated and
the sintering may be effected not only in vacuum, but also in
an atmosphere of N2 and/or H2. Accordingly, ordinarily
employed sintering furnaces are sufficient for this purpose.
However, according to the further investigations made by us,
it has been found that the Cr-based alloy steel powder is
disadvantageous in that the sintered body is increased in
strength through the precipitation of carbides and/or 
nitrides of Nb and V, so that the fatigue strength and
toughness lower owing to the existence of the carbides and
nitrides which act as sites of fracture.Where iron parts for which high strength is required
are fabricated according to the powder metallurgical
technique, it is usual to obtain necessary characteristics by
a procedure which comprises sintering an alloy steel powder
