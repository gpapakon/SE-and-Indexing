is supported thereon so as to be rotatable relative

to the bracket (31) or the floor support
(51).
The shower partition of claim 2,

with a counter-support area (71).
The shower partition of claim 3,

characterized in that a friction reducing means
(75) is provided between the supporting area (69)

The shower partition of claim 4,

characterized in that the friction reducing means
is formed by a roller bearing (75) having a roller

bearing path concentric with the pivot axis.
The shower partition of one or several of the preceding
claims,

characterized in that the supporting area (69) of
a lower bracket (31) or the floor support (51) and

the counter-support area (71) of a lower hinge
body (39) have a door lifting means (81) associated

therewith which, during pivoting of the
door (23, 25; 55, 57) in opening direction,

effects door lifting and renders possible a defined
end position of the door pivoting motion at 

least in the closed position of the door (23, 25;
55, 57).
The shower partition of claim 6,

characterized in that the door lifting means (81)
has at least one roller body (75) which in a

closed position of the door is held in a lower and
an upper roller body receiving means (83, 85) of

the supporting area (69) and the counter-support
area (71), and in an open position is moved out of

at least one roller body receiving means (83 or
85).
The shower partition of claim 7,

characterized in that at least one of the roller
body receiving means (83, 85), at an edge diagonally

opposed with respect to the roller body
(75), is provided with a lifting slope (91, 93),

with a rolling motion taking place between roller
body (75) and lifting slope while the door (23,

25; 55, 57) is pivoted to the open position.
The shower partition of claim 8,

characterized in that only the upper roller
bearing receiving means (83) forms part of a

roller bearing path with a lifting slope, and the
roller body (75) permanently remains in the lower

roller body receiving means (85).
The shower partition of claim 8,

characterized in that only the lower roller
bearing receiving means (85) forms part of a

roller bearing path with a lifting slope, and the
roller body (75) permanently remains in the upper

roller body receiving means (83). 
The shower partition of at least one of claims 3
