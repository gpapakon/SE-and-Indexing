<ABSTRACT>
The femoral component for a hip joint prosthesis has an 
intramedullary stem (1) having a free distal region (2), a proximal 

region (3) extending to a neck (4) for receiving a ball head (5), 
a medial 

side and a lateral side.
 

The stem has screw holes (11) extending from said lateral side to 
said medial side for receiving bone screws (12) in the lateral to 

medial direction for fixation of said stem (1) to the medial cortex (52). 
The stem (1) is coupled primarily to the medial cortex  (52) of 

the femur 
(50) and only secondarily to the cancellous portion (18) of the proximal 

femur (4) to aid the rotational (torsional) stability of the 
implant.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a femoral component for a hip joint
prosthesis with an intramedullary stem having a free distal
region, a proximal region extending to a neck for receiving a
ball head, a medial side and a lateral side.Long lasting cementless fixation of the femoral component of the
hip joint prosthesis remains an unsolved problem. Efforts to do
so by surface treatments of the prosthesis stem that would allow
bony ingrowth have not resulted in satisfactory clinical results
and the cemented femoral component is still considered a better
choice for most patients. Current designs of all stemmed hip
prosthesis rely on the load transfer by rod-in-tube
configuration. The load on the head of the prosthesis results in
both axial and transverse forces and bending moments (mostly in
the frontal plane, but also, and depending on the particular 
action of the patient, in other planes, generally torsional loads
around the long axis of the stem) which must be transferred to
bone.
This leads to stem-bone interactions along the stem, which
generally compress the medial cortex proximally and the lateral
cortex distally. Due to additional muscle loads on predominantly
the greater trochanter, bone undergoes significant deformation
and it is very difficult if possible at all, to prevent the
movements at the prosthesis-bone interface. Bony ingrowth is thus
inhibited, and if, and when it occurs, it is limited to only some
areas of the interface. At other places motion persists leading
to pain, overall instability of the implant and eventual failure.
In same cases of porous (bead) coated stems the bone has been
seen to integrate well on the distal parts of the prosthesis,
which in turn produced massive bone loss due to stress-shielding.Document EP-A-0 465 436 discloses a hip prosthesis which
intramedullary stem is also screwed to the femur.The invention described here solves the problem of stem fixation
by coupling the stem primarily to the medial cortex of the
femur, and only secondarily to the cancellous portion of the
proximal femur for aiding the rotational (torsional) stability.
Means of fixation are bone screws locked into the stem to
prevent them from wobbling loose in the bone. The various features of novelty which characterize the
invention are pointed out with particularity in the claims
annexed to and forming part of this disclosure. For the better
understanding of the invention, its operating advantages and
specific objects attained by its use, reference should be had to
the accompanying drawings,
