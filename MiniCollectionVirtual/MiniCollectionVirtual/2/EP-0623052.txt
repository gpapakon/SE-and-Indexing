<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to microcapsules and to a 
process for reducing the formaldehyde content of formulations 
containing microcapsules. In particular, this invention 
relates to encapsulated droplets of a liquid material which is 
substantially insoluble in water, where the encapsulating 
agent is a film formed from an amino resin and preferentially 
from a modified urea-formaldehyde prepolymer. The use of membranes, coatings, and capsules for the 
controlled release of liquid materials is well known in the 
art of both agricultural and non-agricultural chemicals. In 
agriculture, controlled release techniques have improved the 
efficiency of herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, 
and fertilizers. Non-agricultural uses include encapsulated 
dyes, inks, pharmaceuticals, flavoring agents, and 
fragrances. The most common forms of controlled release materials 
are coated droplets or microcapsules, coated solids 
including both porous and non-porous particles, and coated 
aggregates of solid particles. In some instances, a water-soluble 
encapsulating film is desired, which releases the 
encapsulated material when the capsule is placed in contact 
with water. Other coatings are designed to release the 
entrapped material when the coating is ruptured by external 
force.  
 Still further coatings are porous in nature and 
release the entrapped material to the surrounding medium at a 
slow rate by diffusion through the pores. In addition to 
providing controlled release, such coatings also serve to 
facilitate the dispersion of water-immiscible liquids into 
water and water-containing media such as wet soil. Droplets 
encapsulated in this matter are particularly useful in agriculture, 
where water from irrigation, rain, and water sprays 
is frequently present. A variety of processes for producing 
such capsules is known. In one process, the capsules are formed by phase 
separation from an aqueous solution through the coacervation 
of a hydrophilic colloid soil. This is described in U.S. 
Patents 2,800,457 (Green et al., July 23, 1957) and 2,800,458 
(Green, July 23, 1957). An interfacial polymerization process is disclosed 
in U.S. Patents 4,046,741 (Scher, September 6, 1977) and 
4,140,516 (Scher, February 20, 1979), whereby the film-forming 
reactants are dissolved in the hydrophobic liquid which is 
dispersed in water, the reaction occurring at the interface 
when the phases are placed in contact as an emulsion. A further interfacial polymerisation process is 
described in U.S. Patent
