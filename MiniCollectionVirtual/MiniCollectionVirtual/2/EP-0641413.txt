<ABSTRACT>
Rotary locks used on transit vehicle doors (2) when opened and closed by a rotating helical door drive member (40). In a preferred embodiment, a first lock utilizes a negative thread portion (51) of the helical drive (40). A second lock utilizes a rotating lock pawl (22) and stop (23). The drive (40) and lock can be used to operate door systems with and without separate door hangers. Compensation for camber variations in car structure is provided through the use of spherical mounts or drive member journals (35, 38).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to transit vehicles with an electric door drive used to open and close a door of said transit vehicle and with a rotary lock for said electric door drive,
and more specifically to
drive systems employing rotary, helical drive members
including primary and secondary mechanical door locks
directly actuated by the helical drive.Rotary helical drives for vehicular doors are
typically disclosed in U.S. Patents 5,077,938, and
3,745,705. The operators in these references employ
rotary drives utilizing ball screw driven members or
drive nuts and include various means of locking the associated
vehicular doors.Drive systems for vehicular doors utilized on
mass transit vehicles must satisfy particular operating
requirements specific to those vehicles. These requirements
include positive, and in some cases, redundant
mechanical lock systems, capable of insuring that doors
remain closed and operable during car travel and any
other car location other than predetermined passenger
discharge areas. Additionally, it is required that doors
can be manually opened through the use of an emergency
release system which allows unlocking the door and manually
forcing the doors from closed to an open position.Door locking is particularly difficult with the
rotary, helical drive, since the door is moved by a nut
or moving member traveling on a threaded rod. With this 
system, any failure of the drive nut or motor actuated
rotating threaded shaft can result in a free-wheeling
door, or an ability to manually or back-drive the operator
to a door open position.Presently used drive systems typically include
complicated and expensive auxiliary mechanisms to provide
locking means external or ancillary to the drive system.The invention disclosed herein features relatively
simple lower cost primary and secondary locks
directly driven by the rotating helical threaded drive
member. Additionally, in the preferred embodiment, the
invention disclosed herein is capable of supporting the
driven door in addition to driving it from open to closed
positions. While the rotary locks disclosed herein are
shown in a configuration having direct door support,
application of the lock to door systems utilizing separate
door hangers is contemplated. Lock operation with
or without a separate hanger is equivalent.Accordingly it is an object of this invention
to provide a transit vehicle with an electric door drive
utilizing a rotary, helical drive member with an integral lock portion. The rotary lock of the drive system of the

<CLAIMS>
A transit vehicle with an electric door drive used to open and close a
door of said transit vehicle and with a rotary lock for said electric door drive comprising:


a rotary helical drive member (40);
means (33) electrically rotating said drive member, and
means (30) supporting said door for motion from open to

close,
characterized by
continuous thread means (44, 45, 46) on said drive
member (40), said threads having positive and negative

pitch segments (42, 51), said segments responding to
running and lock portions of said drive member,

respectively:
nut means (52, 54) running on said thread means (44,
45, 46), said nut means attached to said support means

(30) for motion therealong when said drive member is
rotated, said motion moving said door along the running

thread portion from door open position (4) to said lock
thread portion (51) for a door closed position, whereby

nut travel into said lock thread portion prevents door
movement without sharp rotation.
The transit vehicle of claim 1, 
characterized by
 car
structure means (11) overhead said door (2), for

mounting said door drive, said structure having load
induced camber variations;


first and second ends (8, 36) on said drive member;
first and second means (34, 41) spherically journaling
said first and second drive member ends, respectively,

for rotation thereon, said journal means mounted on and
disposed along said structure (11); 
cylindrical roller bearing means in one of said journal
means (34) :
thrust roller bearing means (41) in the other of said
journal means (41);
wherein load induced variations car structure camber
are compensated by said journaling means.
The transit vehicle according to claim 1, 
characterized by
said rotary helical drive member (40) having first and
second ends (8, 36), said ends journaled overhead said

door opening for rotary motion;
means (33, 37) on said second end (36), electrically
rotating said drive member (40);
said nut means having a face (53) adjoining said drive
member first end (8), an outer edge on said face, said

nut carrying said door for motion therealong when said
drive member is rotated, said motion moving said door

from open to closed;

end (8), said lock pawl extending perpendicular to said

drive member and occupying a limited sector of said
pawl rotating periphery;
striker means (23) on said nut edge end extending
outward and downward therefrom, said striker occupying

a limited sector of said nut periphery;
a lock space (32) defined by said striker nut face;
means disposing said rotating lock pawl within said
lock face for a door close position;
wherein nut travel from door open to door close
positions moves said lock pawl to said lock space,

thereby preventing wall motion without drive member
rotation.
The transit vehicle according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized by
 a face, having an outer edge on said
nut, said face adjoining the first drive member (8)

and;

overtaking said lock pawl (22) on said helical drive
member first end (8), said lock pawl extending

perpendicular to said drive member and occupying a
limited sector of said lock pawl rotating periphery;
striker means (23) on said nut means, said striker
extending inward from said nut outer edge and spaced

therefrom, said striker and nut face defining a lock
space (32) adjacent said nut face;
means disposing said lock pawl (22) internal of said
lock space (32) for a door closed position;
wherein said door close position of said nut and said
lock pawl prevent door movement along said drive member

without drive member rotation.
