<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device for monitoring electrical loads, in particular heating elements in motor vehicles is described. The current which flows through the loads is detected. By evaluating the current, a defect in at least one of the loads can be detected. The device detects a defect if the current decreases more quickly than expected and/or if the current deviates from an expected value at a prescribed time.

<CLAIMS>
Method for monitoring at least one electrical 
load, in particular heating elements in motor vehicles, 

the current flowing through the load or loads being 
sensed during a heating process and a defect in at least 

one load being detected by evaluating the current, 
characterized in that a defect is detected if the current 

deviates from an expected value at a prescribable time, 
the expected value being determined on the basis of a 

measured current value and at least one further measured 
variable which influences the current value. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the expected value is determined on the basis of a 

current value and as a function of at least one of the 
following influencing variables: operating voltage, 

temperature of the load, ageing of the load and tolerances. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the expected value is determined on 

the basis of a current value of a preceding heating 
process. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the expected value is determined on 

the basis of a current value at a previous time during 
the heating process. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the overall current through all the 

loads is evaluated. 
Device for monitoring at least one electrical 
load, in particular heating elements in motor vehicles,  

 
the current flowing through the load or loads being 

sensed during a heating process and a defect in at least 
one load being detected by evaluating the current, 

characterized in that means are provided which detect a 
defect if the current deviates from an expected value at 

a prescribable time, the expected value being determined 
on the basis of a measured current value and at least one 

further measured variable which influences the current 
value. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the heating elements are glow plugs.
