<ABSTRACT>
An X-ray contrast medium for examining large and small intestines comprises an aqueous suspension containing 15-35 % 
(by W/V, the same applies hereinbelow) of barium sulfate and 0.6-0.15 % of xanthan gum, wherein the amount of the gum is reduced 

as the concentration of the sulfate is increased and vice versa, more specifically, the amount of the gum is 0.3-0.6, 0.2-0.5 
and 0.15-0.4 % when the concentration of the sulfate is 15-20, 20-30 and 30-35 %, respectively. This medium has an extremely 

good fluidity, gives a clear contrast even in a minute portion of an intestinal wall, and improves the transmittance of X-rays. 
Therefore, it has remarkable merits such that the frequency of the postural change of a subject can be reduced and the requirement 

for the expertism of the operator can be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a barium sulfate contrast
medium for use in X-ray examination by double contrast
method of the large and small intestines, and also in
computed tomography (X-ray CT) of the large intestine,
practiced in the medical field.In recent years, with the change in food life to
European and American styles, large intestine cancer is
remarkably increasing in Japan, too and the importance of
large intestine examination has been rapidly recognized.Nowadays, progress and propagation of diagnostic
imaging by computed tomography (X-ray CT), ultra-sonography
(US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), etc. are
remarkable, and these diagnostic imagings have been also
incorporated into the diagnostic region of tubular organs
such as the large intestine. However, most of large
intestine diseases stem from lesions occuring in mucosa,
and for discovery of such lesions, as a matter of course,
but also for grasping of detailed characteristics of the 
lesions, enema X-ray examination and endoscopy have been
utilized as important means.The enema X-ray examination methods known in the prior
art may be broadly classified into the filling method, the
double contrast method, the compression method, the mucosal
relief method, etc., and according to the present standard
of Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan (reevaluation
result), it is approved to use 200 to 2,000 ml of a 20 to
130 w/v % barium sulfate contrast medium.Among these methods, since double contrast barium
enema is optimum for imaging of lesions and diagnosis
thereof, it holds the primary place in the current
examinations.The double contrast barium enema is a method, in which
barium sulfate, a positive contrast medium, is coated as a
thin layer on the inner walls of the large intestine, and
air, a negative contrast medium, is simultaneously
insufflated to inflate the large intestine, whereafter X-ray
transmission is performed to image the state of the
large intestine mucosa surface.The double contrast barium enema includes the Fisher
method (1923) in which an aqueous barium sulfate suspension
with a concentration of about 40-50 w/v % is injected as a
contrast medium after washing the intestine, the contrast
medium is discharged out of the body and then air is
insufflated before taking double contrast images; the Welin 
method (1953) in which after washing the intestine with
quantities of water or enema as the primary treatment an
aqueous barium sulfate suspension with a high concentration
of about 100 w/v % is likewise charged into the intestine
a

<CLAIMS>
An X-ray contrast medium for a double contrast enema examination of the large
and the small intestine comprising an aqueous

suspension containing 15 to 35 w/v % of barium sulfate
and 0.15 to 0.6 w/v % of xanthan gum, wherein if the

barium sulfate concentration is in the range of 15 to
20 w/v %, the concentration of xanthan gum used is in the

range of 0.3 to 0.6 w/v %; if the barium sulfate
concentration is in the range of 20 to 30 w/v %, the

concentration of xanthan gum used is in the range of 0.2 to
0.5 w/v %; and if the barium sulfate concentration

is in the range of 30 to 35 w/v %, the concentration of
xanthan gum used is in the range of 0.15 to 0.4 w/v %,

and wherein, in each case, the higher the barium
sulfate concentration is, the smaller the amount of

xanthan gum used is; and the lower the barium sulfate
concentration is, the larger the amount of xanthan gum

used is.
The X-ray contrast medium as claimed in claim 1,
wherein gum arabic and/or sodium chondroitin sulfate

are/is additionally incorporated.
