<ABSTRACT>
A gas-liquid separating apparatus capable of 
sufficiently separating gas in gas-liquid mixture fluid from 

liquid therein, is disclosed. Gas-liquid mixture fluid fed 
from a boiler evaporator tube enters through a separator 

inlet 15 into a cylinder 9 of a separator 12 in a tangential 
direction, thus becomes a rotating flow 8 along the inner 

wall surface of the cylinder 9, and thereby centrifugal 
separation between gas and liquid is effected. The 

separated steam is discharged from a secondary separator 11 
through a cap 18 into a gas-phase section within a drum 1. 

A part of the primary isolated water 8 of the rotating flow 
has its outflow velocity decelerated by a perforated plate 

23, and thereafter flows out to a liquid-phase section 

within the drum 1. As a result, a flow velocity of the 
primary isolated water 20 flowing out through a primary 

isolated water outlet 17 to the liquid-phase section within 
the drum 1 is decreased as compared to the case where the 

prior art was employed, and hence, an amount of the primary 
isolated water drawn into a flow 22 within the drum is 

reduced. Moreover, since the primary isolated water 21 
having flowed out through the perforated plate 23 to the 

liquid-phase section within the drum 1 has a slow outflow 
velocity, it becomes an upward blow in the vicinity of the 

cylinder 9 due to influence of a buoyancy acting upon a  
 

steam component. Accordingly, the time available for 
gravitational separation of gas and liquid in the liquid 

phase within the drum 1 can be reserved longer than in the 
case of employing the prior art.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas-liquid 
separating apparatus as defined in the preamble of claim 1 and 2, applicable to an electric power plant 
or the like. As one example of a gas-liquid separating 
apparatus in the prior art, a steam drum applicable to an 
electric power plant is shown in Figs. 10 to 13. A structure used in this steam drum and shown at 
12 in Fig. 10 is called "separator". The separator 12 is 
equipped within a drum 1 as shown in Fig. 10. In Fig. 10, 
a right half shows an outer appearance of the separator 12, 
while a left half shows a vertical cross-section view of 
the separator 12. Besides, a mist separator 5, a rectifier 
plate 6 for preventing vortexes, and the like are equipped 
within the drum 1. As shown mainly in Figs. 11 and 12, the separator 
12 is composed of a cylinder 9, a cap 11 and a secondary 
separator 11. As this secondary separator 11, a structure 
consisting of a stack of corrugated plates or a structure of 
fan blade profile is employed. Now, description will be made on flows of gas-mixture  
 
fluid in a steam drum constructed in the 
above-described manner. In Fig. 10, gas-liquid mixture 
fluid 19 fed from a boiler evaporator tube enters a 
separator inlet 15 through an inlet piping 2. A gas 
component of this gas-liquid mixture fluid is specifically 
steam, and a liquid component is unevaporated liquid. The 
gas-liquid mixture fluid 19 fed through the separator inlet 
15 enters from the separator inlet 15 into a cylinder 9 in 
the tangential direction of the cylinder 9 as shown in Fig. 
13, thus becomes a rotating flow 8 along the inner wall 
surface of the cylinder 9, and thereby centrifugal 
separation between gas and liquid is effected. The 
separated steam is discharged from a secondary separator 11 
through a cap 18 to a gas-phase section within a drum 1 as a 
steam flow 28 shown in Fig. 10. Also, the separated liquid 
flows out from a primary isolated water outlet 17 to a 
liquid-phase section within the drum 1 as a primary isolated 
water 20. It is to be noted that since the centrifugal 
separation in the cylinder 9 is not sufficient, as shown in 
Fig. 11, liquid 7 also partly flows into the secondary 
separator 11, and as shown in Fig. 10 it flows out as 
secondary isolated water 13 from a cap gap 16 through a cap 
bottom 10 to a gas-liquid boundary surface 14 within the 
drum. Likewise, steam is mixed also in the primary isolated  
 
water 20 flowing out from the primary isolated water outlet 
17 to the liquid-phase section within the drum.
