<ABSTRACT>
A video camera (1⊘) includes a motion detecting 
circuit (2⊘) in which correlative values of pixels at a 

present field are evaluated through the comparison of an 
image signal of a last field and an image signal of the 

present field. In the motion detecting circuit (2⊘), an 
average correlative value and a minimum correlative value 

are further evaluated. A microcomputer (26) determines 
whether or not these correlative values satisfy 

predetermined conditions for each of detection areas 
defined within an image field (44). A detection area 

which satisfies all the predetermined conditions becomes 
a valid detection area. A whole motion vector is 

detected by methods different from each other according 
to the number of the valid detection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video camera.
More specifically, the present invention relates to a
compact video camera with electronic picture stabilizer,
which is utilized as a camcorder, for example.One example of a method for detecting an
unintentional motion component of an image sensing device
is disclosed in, for example, the 2⊘th image engineering
conference in 1989 by Matsushita Electric Industrial
Corporation. In this prior art method, by utilizing a
motion vector obtained by a representative point matching
method disclosed in, for example,
JP-A- 61(1986)-2⊘1581,
the motion component of the image sensing device is
detected according to image information. In this prior
art, an electronic picture stabilization is performed on
the basis of a whole motion vector obtained from the
image information.More specifically, in this prior art, four detection
areas are arranged in an image field, and four portion 
motion vectors are obtained from the image field. Then,
the whole motion vector is evaluated by averaging the
portion motion vectors of the four detection areas, or
the whole motion vector is evaluated by averaging portion
motion vectors of two portion motion vectors having
intermediate values of the four portion motion vectors,
whereby the electronic picture stabilization is performed on
the basis of the whole motion vector thus evaluated.However, in such a method, in a case where an object
passed through a detection area, for example, when there
is a detection area in which a portion motion vector
which is not caused by the unintentional motion of the
camera is detected, the whole motion vector is affected
by this detection area, and therefore, the motion of the
camera can not be accurately detected, and thus, the
electronic picture stabilization can not be performed with
precision. SMPTE Journal vol. 101, no. 2, February 1992, White Plains, NY USA pages 66 to 75 , K.
