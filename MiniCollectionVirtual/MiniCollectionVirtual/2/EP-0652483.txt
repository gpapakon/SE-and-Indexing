<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to lithographic printing 
plates which are adapted for imaging by IR lasers and 
which do not require wet development. Due to the widespread use in the graphic arts 
industry of electronic generation, storage and output of 
image information, there is a growing interest in 
providing printing plates that are imageable by lasers, 
preferably IR semiconductor lasers. Currently, a laser 
imagesetter is typically used to output an image on a 
film which is then used for exposure of a plate in a 
contact process. It also has long been recognised that 
direct exposure of the plate with an imagesetter or 
similar device would provide considerable savings in time 
and money. EP0444786, JP63-208036 and JP63-274592A disclose 
photopolymer resists that are sensitised to the near IR. 
So far, none has proved commercially viable, and all 
require wet development to wash off the unexposed 
regions. EP0514145 describes a laser addressed plate in 
which heat generated by the laser exposure causes 
particles in the plate coating to melt and coalesce and 
hence change their solubility characteristics. Once 
again, wet development is required. A somewhat different approach is disclosed US 
3,787,210, US 3,962,513, EP0001068 and JP04-140191. Heat 
generated by laser exposure of a donor sheet is used to 
physically transfer a resinous material from the donor to 
a receptor held in intimate contact with the donor. 
Provided the receptor surface has suitable hydrophilic 
properties, it can then be used as a printing plate. 
This method has the advantage of not requiring any wet 
processing, but in order to achieve realistic write-times, 
a high power YAG (or similar) laser is required, 
which has restricted the usefulness of the method. Polymer coatings which undergo a change in surface 
properties in response to light exposure are known in the  
 
art. WO92/09934 discloses coatings that become 
hydrophilic as a result of irradiation, and WO92/02855 
describes coatings that become tacky as a result of 
irradiation. In both cases, the coatings comprise an 
acid-sensitive polymer and a photochemical source of 
strong acid, and in both cases the preferred acid-sensitive 
polymer is derived from a cyclic acetal ester 
of acrylic or methacrylic acid, such as tetrahydropyranyl 
(meth)acrylate. WO92/02855 discloses that the acid-sensitive polymer 
is blended with a low-Tg polymer to produce a coating 
that is initially non-tacky, but on irradiation undergoes 
phase separation as a result of chemical conversion
