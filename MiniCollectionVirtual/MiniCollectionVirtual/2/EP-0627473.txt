<ABSTRACT>
A water-base coating resin composition substantially comprising a mixture of: (1) a reaction product (C) 
between an aromatic polyol resin (A-1) and a carboxylated acrylic resin (B), (2) an aromatic epoxy resin (D), and (3) 

another aromatic polyol resin (A-2), wherein the ratio of component (A-1) to component B by weight satisfies the 
relationship of the formula 


(I):   85/15≦(A-1)/(B)≦15/85 
 
, and the proportions of components (C), (D) and (A-2) satisfy 

the relationship of the formulae 

(II):   1≦(D)+(A-2)≦80 
 
 and 


(III):   1≦(D)≦80 
 
, the total weight of them being 100. A 

water-base coating composition is prepared by dispersing the above resin composition in an aqueous medium without 
using any organic solvent. The obtained coating composition is excellent in long-term stability and gives a coating 

film which is excellent in retorting resistance, adhesion to metal, processability and chemical resistance and can be 
cured at a comparatively low temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a resin composition
for water-based coating which comprises an aromatic polyol
resin and an aromatic epoxy resin as main components, and
to a water-based coating composition. More specifically,
the invention relates to a resin composition for water-based
coating and a water-based coating composition
capable of forming an excellent coating film as a coating
composition for metals, particularly coating for the inner
surface of a can and PCM coating.In the case of solvent-based coatings which use
an organic solvent, the use of an organic solvent is now
being more restricted than before from a viewpoint of
resource and energy saving and environmental preservation.
For this reason, it is desired to shift to coatings which
use a water-based solvent.Particularly, epoxy resin coatings have been
mainly studied to shift can coating for coating metal
surfaces, PCM (precoat metal) coating and corrosion-resistant
coating to coating using a water-based solvent.
For example EP-A-0 232 021 describes heat curable coating
compositions suitable as coatings for metal can ends which
contain epoxy resins, acrylic resins and alkylated phenol novolac resins. 
Various methods for improving the water solubility of
epoxy resins have been proposed.For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Publication Nos.1228/1978 and 1285/1978 disclose a method
which comprises the steps of polymerizing an acrylic
monomer including a carboxyl group-containing monomer
using a radical initiator such as benzoyl peroxide in the
presence of an epoxy resin, grafting from the aliphatic
hydrocarbon site of the epoxy resin, and dispersing the
resulting polymer into water using a basic compound such
as ammonium and amine. However, the method described above has the
defects that it is necessary to enhance graft ratio to
achieve a highly stable emulsion and that a large volume
of radical initiator such as benzoyl peroxide which is
expensive and involves high risk of explosion must be used
at the time of production.To solve the above problems, Japanese Patent
Laid-Open Publication No.3481/1980 discloses a method
which comprises the steps of esterifying a carboxyl group-containing
vinyl polymer with an epoxy group of an epoxy
resin in the presence of an amine-based esterifying
catalyst to achieve an epoxy resin modified by the
carboxyl group-containing vinyl polymer and having
substantially no epoxy group, neutralizing the resulting
epoxy resin with a base, and dispersing the epoxy resin
into water.However, since a reaction is continued
