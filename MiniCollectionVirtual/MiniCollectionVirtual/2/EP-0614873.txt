<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hetero-bifunctional hexafluoropropylene
oxide compound and a method of making thereof. The compound
possesses two different functional groups, a vinyl group at one end
of the molecular chain and a -COF group at the other. The
invention is also directed to novel starting materials used to make
the compounds.A polymer of hexafluoropropylene oxide (HFPO) can possess various
groups at its terminals depending on the types of polymerization
initiators used during the polymerization process. For example,
HFPO polymers with the following groups at the ends of their
molecular chains, i.e., terminals, are already known: CF3-,
CF3(CF2)4-, (CF3)2CF-, (CF3)2CF-CF(CF3)-, FSO2-, CH3S-, CH3OCO-,
and ICF2-, The HFPO copolymers having these groups are reviewed in
Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 24, 161 (1985).Further, carbonyl fluoride (U.S. Pat. 3,114,778),
perfluoropentanoyl fluoride (DE-OS 2,614,333), hexafluoroacetone
(U.S. Pat. 3,274,239), and perfluoromethyl isopropyl ketone (U.S.
Pat. 3,274,239) have been used as the initiators. The HFPO
polymers obtained by using these initiators are expressed by the
formula below:
Rf'-O-(Y)p-CF(CF3)-COF
Wherein Rf' is a perfluoroalkyl group, Y is the HFPO unit expressed
by -CF(CF3)-CF2O-, and p is either 0 or a positive integer. On one
terminal of the molecular chain (the opposite terminal from the
side where the -COF group is connected) is the perfluoroalkyl
group, which is a non-functional group.Further, HFPO polymers with a functional group introduced at one
end of their molecular chains by utilizing specific acid fluorides
as an initiator are also know. For example, British Patent
2,053,902 shows an example which utilizes FSO2-CF2-CF2-COF as an
initiator and the HFPO polymer obtained in this case is expressed 
by the formula below:
FSO2-CF2-CF2-CF2-CF2-O-(Y)p-CF(CF3)-COF,
wherein Y and p are same as described above. This compound is
understood as a hetero-bifunctional polymer with a functional group
(-FSO2) introduced at one end of the molecular chain. Various
other initiators which lead to the hetero-bifunctional polymers are
also known and examples thereof are:
CH3S-(CF2)3-COF   (British Patent 2,051,831),CH3OOC-(CF2)4-COF   (DE-OS 2,708,677), andI-CF2-COF   (U.S. Pat. 3,311,658).However, HFPO compounds and polymers with a vinyl group of the
molecular chain have not been reported. The terminal functional
groups of the known HFPO compounds and polymers do not include
vinyl groups. Such compounds and polymers without terminal vinyl
groups are
