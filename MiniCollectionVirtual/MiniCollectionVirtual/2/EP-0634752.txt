<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a cladding having an outer circumferential 
substrate, a zirconium barrier layer metallurgically bonded to the inside surface of the 

substrate and an inner circumferential liner metallurgically bonded to the zirconium 
barrier. The inner circumferential liner is more ductile than conventional Zircaloy. The 

low ductility of the inner circumferential liner is obtained by using a zirconium alloy 

containing a low tin content (e.g. less than 1.2% by weight) and/or a low oxygen 
content (e.g. less than 1000 ppm). The inner circumferential liner is less than about 25 

micrometers thick.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of fabricating cladding for use in nuclear 
fuel elements. Nuclear reactors have their fuel contained in sealed cladding for the isolation 
of the nuclear fuel from the moderator/coolant system. The term cladding, as used 
herein, refers to a zirconium based alloy tube. Often the cladding will be composed of 
various layers including a zirconium alloy substrate and an unalloyed zirconium barrier. The cladding -- nominally in the order of 0.030 inches thick -- is formed in 
the shape of a tube with the nuclear fuel contained typically in pellet form therein. 
These pellets are stacked in contact with one another for almost the entire length of each 
cladding tube, which cladding tube is in the order of 160 inches in length. Typically, 
the cladding tube is provided with springs for maintaining the axial position of the fuel 
pellets and so-called "getters" for absorbing fission gases. Thereafter, the internal 
portions of the fuel rod are pressurized with helium to help conduct the heat from the 
fuel material to the cladding. Zirconium and its alloys, under normal circumstances, are excellent for 
nuclear fuel cladding since they have low neutron absorption cross sections and, at 
temperatures below about 350°C, are strong, ductile, extremely stable and relatively 
nonreactive in the presence of demineralized water or steam. "Zircaloys" are a family 
of corrosion-resistant zirconium alloy cladding materials. They are composed of 98-99% 
by weight zirconium, with the balance being tin, iron, chromium, and nickel. 
"Zircaloy-2" and Zircaloy-4" are two widely-used zirconium-based alloys for 
cladding. Zircaloy-2 has on a weight basis about 1.2 to 1.7 percent tin; 0.12 percent  
 
iron; 0.09 percent chromium and 0.05 percent nickel. Zircaloy-4 has essentially no 
nickel and about 0.2% iron but is otherwise substantially similar to Zircaloy-2. Splitting of Zircaloy cladding may occur due to the interactions between the 
nuclear fuel, the cladding, and the fission products produced during the nuclear 
reaction. It has been found that this undesirable performance is due to localized 
mechanical stresses on the fuel cladding resulting from differential expansion and 
friction between the fuel and the cladding. These localized stresses and strain in the 
presence of specific fission products, such as iodine and cadmium, are capable of 
producing cladding failures by phenomena known as stress corrosion cracking and 
liquid metal embrittlement. To combat this problem, some
