<ABSTRACT>
A stereoscopic disk (50) for viewing stereo images in a 
binocular viewer includes a film disk with a plurality of 

stereo image pairs (54) disposed around the periphery of the film 
disk, sandwiched between a pair of disks of opaque material 

defining windows, in which the stereo images on the film 
disk are located. A method for making the stereoscopic 

disks includes the steps of making a master image (68) of the 
stereoscopic images arranged in a circular pattern, printing 

the master image onto photographic film, laminating the film 
with strips of opaque material (56,58) having windows for the images 

on the disk, and punching out the finished disk from the 
laminated assembly. A simple stereo viewer employs the film 

disks without the laminations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stereoscopic 
disk of the type having a plurality of stereo image pairs 
arranged around the periphery of the disk, the images of the 
pairs being arranged diametrically opposite each other on 
the disk, and a method of making such a stereoscopic disk 
and a viewer employing such a stereoscopic disk. In a well known system of stereoscopic imaging, 
transparent stereo image pairs are arranged around the 
periphery of a disk. The stereo images are viewed by 
inserting the disk in a binocular viewer. Successive image 
pairs are viewed by rotating the disk in the viewer, for 
example, by actuating a lever that engages the disk and 
rotates the disk by two image widths. Such a stereoscopic 
imaging system is widely available and sold under the 
trademark View-Master. 
Figs. 5-8 illustrate the construction of the conventional 
View-Master disk. As 
shown in Fig. 5, the conventional 
View-Master disk includes 
14 film chips generally designated 10 and as shown in Fig. 6 
a disk formed from six layers of laminated paper and foil 
12. The film chips 10 representing 7 stereo image pairs 
14a, b - 26a, b are made from images exposed and developed 
on 16mm movie film, and then cut into chips. The paper and 
foil disk 12 includes four layers of paper 28, 30, 32, and 
34, and two layers of foil 36, 38. The paper and foil is 
prelaminated into two units of paper-foil-paper prior to 
assembly of the disk. Windows 40 are cut in the paper and 
foil for mounting the stereo pairs. Fig. 7 shows how the 
film chips are mounted in the paper and foil laminated disk 
12. Fig. 8 is an exploded cross sectional view of a  
 
completed 
View-Master disk 
taken along line 8-8 in Fig. 7 
showing how the film chips 14a, b are mounted in the windows 
40 that are cut in the laminated disk. Referring back to 
Fig. 6, one of the weak points of the conventional 
View-Master disk 
is the thin web of material 42 between the 
interior corners of the windows 40 in the laminated disk 12. 
Because this web of material 42 needs to be at least greater 
than some minimum dimension, the size of the stereo image 
for a given number of images, e.g. 14 images separated by a 
given stereo separation x, e.g. 65mm is limited to some 
maximum dimension, e.g. 10.5x11.7mm. Although a 65mm 
separation between the images in a stereo pair is 
comfortable for the average adult, a separation of 55mm to 
58mm is more appropriate for a child under the age of 10. 
Unfortunately, if the separation is reduced from 65mm to 
55mm, the

A stereoscopic disk, comprising: 

a. a disk of photographic film bearing a 
plurality of stereoscopic image pairs arranged around the 

circumference of the disk; and 
b. first and second disks of opaque material 
defining a plurality of windows around the periphery of said 

opaque disks, said disks of photographic film being 
laminated between said first and second disks of opaque 

material with said image pairs located in said windows. 
The stereoscopic disk claimed in claim 1, 
wherein said opaque material is paper. 
The stereoscopic disk claimed in claim 1 or 
2, wherein the stereo pairs are spaced diametrically apart 

by between 55-58mm. 
The stereoscopic disk claimed in any of 
claims 1 to 3, having seven pairs of images of 10.5 x 

11.7mm. 
A method of making a stereoscopic disk, 
comprising the steps of: 


a. providing a master stereoscopic image 
including a plurality of stereoscopic image pairs arranged 

in a circle; 
b. printing the master stereoscopic image onto a 
strip of photographic film in a photographic printer; 
c. developing the stereoscopic image in the 
photographic film; and 
d. forming a disk containing the print of the 
stereoscopic images out of the photographic film. 
The method claimed in claim 5, wherein said 
step of printing the master stereoscopic image further 

comprises the steps of: 

a. preparing a second generation master loop of 
film bearing a plurality of images of said master 

stereoscopic image, and 
b. printing said secondary master image onto said 
strip of photographic film while simultaneously advancing 

said strip of photographic film and circulating said second 
generation master loop.

said step of providing a master stereoscopic image, further 

comprises the steps of: 

a. recording a plurality of stereo image pairs on 
a photographic film; 
b. scanning the stereo image pairs in a film 
scanner to produce digital images; 
c. manipulating the digital images to compensate 
for subsequent printer distortion and to arrange the digital 

images in a circle; and 
d. generating the master stereoscopic image on a 
digital film writer.
