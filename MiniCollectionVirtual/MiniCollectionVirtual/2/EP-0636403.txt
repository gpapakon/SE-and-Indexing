<ABSTRACT>
A cellulose acetate membrane composed of a mixture 
comprising a cellulose triacetate and a cellulose diacetate and 

having an improved heat stability, which does not substantially 
show a melting peak of cellulose diacetate but substantially 

shows a melting peak of cellulose triacetate, in a differential 
thermal analysis. By mixing a cellulose triacetate and a 

cellulose diacetate at an appropriate ratio, crystallization or 
orientational crystallization of each component due to a high 

pressure steam sterilization can be avoided and a cellulose 
acetate membrane with improved water permeability and sieving 

coefficient of myoglobin after a high pressure steam 
sterilization can be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a separating membrane with 
an improved heat resistance. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to a cellulose acetate membrane permitting 
high pressure steam sterilization, a method for producing the 
membrane and to a hemodialyzer using said membrane. A cellulose acetate superior in the balance of 
hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity has been widely used for 
industrial purposes as a gas separation membrane, a reversed 
semipermeable membrane, an ultrafiltration membrane, a precision 
filtration membrane or the like, as well as a hemodialysis 
membrane to be used for an artificial kidney (hemodialyzer). 
When a cellulose triacetate membrane or a cellulose diacetate 
membrane is used for a hemodialyzer as a hollow fiber membrane 
for hemodialysis, however, high pressure steam sterilization 
(e.g. at 120°C for 20 min) causes deterioration by heat and 
structural change due to crystallization and orientational 
crystallization, so that water permeability and permeation of 
solute are markedly impaired to prohibit application of the 
high pressure steam sterilization to cellulose acetate 
membrane. An object of the present invention is to provide a membrane  
 
which does not suffer from such conventional defect, namely, a 
cellulose acetate membrane improved in heat stability to allow 
high pressure steam sterilization. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
method for producing said cellulose acetate membrane. A still another object of the present invention is to 
provide a hemodialyzer using said cellulose acetate membrane. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
cellulose acetate membrane composed of a mixture comprising a 
cellulose triacetate and a cellulose diacetate and having an 
improved heat stability, which does not substantially show a 
melting peak of cellulose diacetate but substantially shows a 
melting peak of cellulose triacetate, in a differential thermal 
analysis. Fig. 1 shows the results of differential thermal analysis 
of cellulose acetate membranes. Fig. 2 shows one embodiment of the present invention, which 
is a schematic presentation of the process with the use of two 
round rod guides in Example 8. Fig. 3 shows another embodiment of the present invention, 
which is a schematic presentation of the process with the use 
of four round rod guides in Example 9. Fig. 4 shows a still another embodiment of the present 
invention, which is a schematic presentation of the process with 
the use of one round rod
