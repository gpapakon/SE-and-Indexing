<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus comprising a liquid-vapour contact column 2 houses an array of 
vertically spaced liquid-vapour contact trays 6a, 6b and 6c, and an arrangement 

of downcomers 8a, 8b and 8c that conduct liquid from tray-to-tray down the 
array. In a vapour space between the trays 6b and 6c there is a liquid-vapour 

disengagement device 34b having vapour passages therethrough and defining a 
surface or surfaces for the flow thereacross of any liquid disengaged from 

vapour ascending the column. The device 34b is typically provided by a sheet 
of expanded metal and has an outlet edge 44 in liquid flow communication with 

the tray 6c via the downcomer 8c.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to liquid-vapour contact apparatus. The term 'vapour' as used herein includes 'gas' within its scope and vice versa. US-A-5 091 119 relates to a liquid-gas contact device comprising: a 
liquid-gas contact tray having a liquid-bearing surface along which in use liquid 
is able to flow from a liquid receiving edge of the liquid bearing surface to an 
opposed liquid outlet edge thereof, a multiplicity of elongate apertures in the 
tray for the passage of gas from below to above the tray, each aperture having 
a gas defector associated therewith and being so disposed as to impart to the 
gas a component of velocity in a direction toward the liquid outlet edge, and at 
least several liquid flow impedance members overlying the liquid-bearing surface 
between said liquid receiving edge and said outlet edge, the defectors and flow 
impedance members having a height such that in operation of the device they 
are fully submerged in the liquid flowing thereacross. The tray preferably 
comprises a sheet of expanded metal. Preferably, the liquid flow impedance 
members are provided by a second sheet of expanded metal overlying the tray. 
The mesh size of the second sheet is greater than that of the first sheet. The 
first sheet of expanded metal typically has a percentage open area in the range 
of 20 to 30%. The liquid-gas contact device is particularly suitable for use as a 
distillation tray in for example the separation of air. In comparison with 
conventional distillation trays, it causes a relatively small pressure drop. 
Moreover, the liquid-gas contact device has good 'turndown' characteristics. 
That is to say it is capable of operating at high efficiency over a range of 
different gas flow rates (and hence gas velocities). The maximum gas velocity at which such liquid-gas contact devices can be used 
efficiently is limited by a tendency for the vapour flowing vertically upwards 
from one tray to the next to carry liquid with it onto the next tray. Accordingly, 
if the liquid-vapour contact is performed as part of a distillation process, the 
ascending vapour becomes effectively enriched in a less volatile component of  
 
the mixture being distilled with the result that the separation is rendered less 
complete. It is an aim of the present invention to provide an apparatus that ameliorates this 
problem. DE-A-2 725 311 discloses a liquid-vapour contact device provided with flow 
openings for vapour generating a transport effect in the direction of a 
downcomer to which the device
