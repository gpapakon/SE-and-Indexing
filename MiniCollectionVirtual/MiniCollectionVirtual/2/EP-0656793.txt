<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a syringe (1) which comprises a rod (5) mounted for reciprocating movement in relation to a container (2), wherein one end of the rod has the form of a needle (3) or is able to coact with a needle. The syringe further comprises a piston (4) and coupling means (6) which connect and disconnect the piston to and from the rod. The coupling means assume a connecting state when the piston is drawn by the rod from a position proximate to the needle to a position in which it is distanced therefrom, and are brought to a disconnecting or disconnected state when the piston is pressed by the rod towards the needle. The coupling means comprise support and/or slide surfaces (5k', 5k) arranged on that part of the rod which is proximal to the needle, and opposing support and/or slide surfaces (4k', 4k) on the piston. The first support and/or slide surfaces (4k') provided on the piston and located nearest the needle (3) are inclined (c) to an extent such that as the rod (5) moves towards the needle (3), the piston (4) is rotated about a container centre line, among others.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A SyringeTECHNICAL FIE PThe present invention relates generally to a syringe and more particularly, although not exclusively, to a syringe which is intended for one time use only, i.e. a so-called disposable syringe, and which is of the kind that includes a rod which is fitted in a con¬ tainer for reciprocating movement in relation thereto and one end of which has the form of or coacts with a needle, a piston which is able to coact with the rod, and coupling means which function to connect and disconnect the piston to and from the rod.The present invention is primarily intended to provide a syringe of this kind which is constructed so as to enable the container to filled with liquid through the needle and the liquid then dispensed through said needle and so that after this the container can no longer be filled with and emptied of liquid.The present invention pertains in particular to a syringe of the kind in which the coupling means which function to connec and disconnect the piston to and from the rod adopt an active coupling state over a movement path in which the piston is drawn by the rod from a position close to the needle to a position in which it is distanced from said needle, and is brought to a disconnected state when the piston is pressed by the rod through an adapted short movement path in a direction towards the needle, said coupling means comprising support and/or slide surfaces which are provided on that part of the rod which lies proximal to the needle and which coact with opposing support and/or slide surfaces on the piston in the coupled state of the rod and the piston. 

BACKGROUND ARTDisposable syringes of the aforedescribed kind, by which is meant syringes that can only be used once, can be divided into a number of function-dependent categories with regard to their function-dependent characteristics.A first syringe category is exemplified by the syringe illustrated and described in the International Patent Publication PCT/SE88/00634, International Publication No. WO 89/04677. In the case of this syringe, the rod can be twisted in relation to the container and the piston so as to move the coupling means on the one hand to a connecting state and on the other hand to a disconnecting state, as the rod is twisted. Thus, with this type of syringe, it is necessary that the piston is unable to twist or rotate, or at least not essen- tially, at the same time as the rod is twisted in relation to the container.It is thus of great importance with this category of syringe that means are provided

C AIMS
1. A syringe (1) which comprises a rod (5) which can be moved reciprocatingly in relation to a container (2) and one end of which has the form of a needle (3) or is able to coact with a needle, and which further comprises a piston (4) which coacts with the rod, and coupling means (6) for connecting and disconnecting the piston to and from the rod, wherein said coupling means assumes a connecting state when the piston is drawn by the rod from a position proximate to the needle to a position in which it is distanced from the needle, and is brought to a disconnecting or discon¬ nected state when the piston is pressed by the rod towards the needle, and wherein said coupling means comprises support and/or slide surfaces (5k', 5k) on that part of the rod which is proximal to the needle and opposing and coacting support and/or slide surfac¬ es (4k', 4k) on the piston, characterized in that the first support and/or slide surfaces (4k') located on the piston nearest the needle (3) are inclined (c) to an extent such as to cause the piston (4) to rotate about a container centre line, among other centre lines, as the rod (5) moves towards the needle (3).
2. A syringe according to Claim 1, characterized in that the angle of inclination (c) is such that as the rod moves towards the needle and after moving through a short path, such as less than one-half the maximum movement path of the rod in the container, the piston will rotate so as to disengage the first support and/or slide surfaces (4k) on the piston from the corresponding first support and/or slide surfaces (5k') and therewith bring the coupling means (6) to a disconnected state.
3. A syringe according to Claim 2, characterized in that said short movement path is less than one-quarter of the maximum movement path of said rod. 


4. A syringe according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, character¬ ized in that the first support and/or slide surfaces (5k') on the rod (5) are configured for parallel, linear or punctiform coaction with the corresponding first support and/or slide surfaces (4k') on the piston.
5. A syringe according to Claim 1, characterized in that the first support and/or slide surfaces (4k', 5k') on the piston and/or on the rod define an angle of between 85° and 20° with a centre line on the piston or the rod, among others.
6. A syringe according to Claim 1, characterized in that the rod is straight and is mounted so as to move reciprocatingly in the container without twisting.
7. A syringe according to Claim 1, characterized in that the second support and/or slide surfaces (4k) on the piston and located distal from the needle are so inclined (c') that as the rod is moved away from the needle (3) the second support and/or slide surfaces on the rod, these surfaces holding the corresponding second support and/or slide surfaces (4k) on the piston in mutually coacting or mutually engaged posi¬ tion, subject the piston to a force which rotates the piston about a container centre line, among others.
8. A syringe according to Claim 7, characterized in that the second support and/or slide surfaces on the rod are configured for parallel, linear or punctiform coaction with corresponding second support and/or slide surfaces on the piston.
