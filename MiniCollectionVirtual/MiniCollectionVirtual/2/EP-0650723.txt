<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to novel pharmaceutical 
use of forskolin derivatives represented by the 

general formula: 

wherein R¹, R² and Ac are as defined later 

(wherein R³ and R⁴ are each hydrogen 
or lower alkyl group, or R³ and R⁴ may be combined to 

represent lower alkylene group which may have oxygen or 
nitrogen atom in the linking chain, and n is an integer of 

1 to 5); R² represents hydrocarbon group having 2 to 3

<DESCRIPTION>
This is a Divisional Application of European Patent Application 91 104 207.5/0448029 The present invention relates to novel pharmaceutical 
use of forskolin derivatives represented by the 
general formula: 
wherein R¹, R² and Ac are as defined later. Forskolin having the above formula wherein R¹ 
is hydrogen and R² is vinyl group is already known to 
have ionotropic, hypotensive and adenylate cyclase-stimulating 
actions (cf. JP-A-52-79015 and 
Arzneimittelforschung, 31, 1248, 1981). The forskolin derivatives used in the present 
invention are also disclosed in prior art literature, e.g. 
EP-A-222413. Regarding the pharmaceutical use of the 
forskolin derivatives, said literature makes mention of  
 
their usefulness as "a remedy for chronic cardiac failure, 
hypotensive agent, and cerebral vasodilator, and in 
addition as a remedy for diseases, such as glaucoma, 
asthma, immunity failure, tumor, and digestive system 
diseases, which are caused by abnormal regulation of cAMP." However, no disclosure has ever been made 
regarding the pharmaceutical use proposed in the present 
invention. The present invention relates to a 
spasmolytic 
agent, therapeutic agent for skin ulcer, peripheral 
circulation improving agent for limbs and differentiation 
inducing and promoting agent which contain as active 
principle a forskolin derivative represented by the 
formula (I): 
wherein R¹ is a group represented by the formula  (wherein R³ and R⁴ are each hydrogen 
or lower alkyl group, or R³ and R⁴ may be combined to 
represent lower alkylene group which may have oxygen or 
nitrogen atom in the linking chain, and n is an integer of 
1 to 5); R² represents hydrocarbon group having 2 to 3 
carbon atoms; and Ac represents acetyl group, or a 
physiologically acceptable salt thereof. With reference to the general formula (I), R³ 
and R₄ in the formula 
represented by 
R¹ in said formula (I) are each hydrogen or a C₁₋₄ lower 
alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and the 
like, and when R³ and R⁴ are combined to represent a 
lower alkylene group which may have oxygen or nitrogen 
atom in the linking chain, there can be cited pyrrolidine, 
piperidine and morpholine as the examples of said lower 
alkylene group. Examples of the groups represented by R¹ in 
the general formula (I) are dimethylaminoacetyl group, 
dimethylaminopropionyl group, dimethylaminobutyryl group, 
dimethylaminopentanoyl group, dimethylaminohexanoyl group, 
aminopropionyl group, aminobutyryl group, aminopentanoyl 
group, aminohexanoyl group,
