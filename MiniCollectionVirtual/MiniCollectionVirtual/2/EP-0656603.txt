<ABSTRACT>
A piezoelectric sensor for detecting elastic plate 
vibrations in an object such as the transmission plate in a 

coordinate input apparatus is prismatic in shape and is 
fixed to the surface of the object. The prismatic sensor 

is arranged so that it is parallel to the direction of 
propagation of the vibrations and has an electrode surface 

perpendicular to the surface of the object. The 
arrangement of the prismatic sensor permits the thickness 

of the object in which the plate vibrations propagate to be 
substantially reduced and reduces the manufacturing cost of 

coordinate input apparatus using the prismatic sensor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a piezoelectric
sensor for detecting a sound wave (vibrations) which
propagates in an object to be measured, and a coordinate
input apparatus employing such a piezoelectric sensor.Coordinate input apparatuses are known, which are
designed to detect sound waves (vibrations) which propagate
in all directions from a position on a measuring plate at
which a user brings a pen having a vibration element into
contact with a measuring plate and to determine a contact
position of the pen by detecting a transmission delay time
of the propagation.Such a coordinate input apparatus generally employs,
as the vibration detection means for detecting vibrations,
a piezoelectric ceramic, such as lead titanate zirconate
(hereinafter referred to as PZT). The detecting element
has a shape and a vibration mode which assure effective
detection of a sound wave having a predetermined frequency 
and propagating in an object to be measured. In an actual
element, the shape thereof is determined such that the
mechanical resonance of the sensor coincides with the
frequency of the sound wave to be detected, and the mode of
the vibrations to be detected and so on are taken into
consideration to determine the sensitivity of the element
and the method of setting the element. In other words, the
shape and so on of the vibration sensor are determined by
the vibration mode or the frequency of the sound wave which
propagates in the object to be measured.Conventional piezoelectric elements will be described
in more in detail below.Vibrations of piezoelectric ceramics are classified
into transverse effect vibrations in which the direction of
an electric field (polarization) is perpendicular to the
direction of deformation and longitudinal effect vibrations
in which the direction of an electric field (polarization)
is parallel to the direction of deformation. Figs. 8 (a)
and 8 (b) show vibration sensors which utilize transverse
effect vibrations, and Figs. 8 (c) and 8 (d) show vibration
sensors which utilize longitudinal vibrations.More specifically, the vibration sensor shown in Fig.
8 (a) is called a radial vibrator which deforms in a radial
direction. In this vibrator, a diameter d of the disk must
be sufficiently large relative to a thickness t thereof. 
The vibration sensor shown in Fig. 8 (b) produces
vibrations of the bar and deforms in the directions of a
length l. In this vibrator, the length l must be
sufficiently large relative to a thickness t and a width w
to assure free expansion and contraction
