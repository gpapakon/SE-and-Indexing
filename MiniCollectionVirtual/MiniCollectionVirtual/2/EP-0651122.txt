<ABSTRACT>
Improvement to pin hinges, ensuring the articulation of a leaf (14) pivoting relative to a fixed frame (28), these hinges being formed by means of two adjacent cylindrical tubular butts (2, 3), through which a common hinge pin (32) is engaged, these butts each being fixed to a lateral tab (5) for fastening to the leaf (14) and the fixed frame (28) respectively, allowing the free movement of the first relative to the second. According to the invention, this improvement is characterised in that each of the two butts (2, 3) comprises in its lateral fastening tab (5) fixed respectively to the leaf (14) and to the fixed frame (28), extending parallel to its tubular element (4), a groove (13) for the mounting and immobilisation of a sealing gasket (22, 29) projecting towards the outside of the tab (5) under this tubular element, in such a way that, in the position in which the leaf bears on the fixed frame, the gaskets carried by the two tabs are in the extension for one another, ensuring sealing continuity in line with the hinge (1).

Assembly formed of a stationary casing (28)
and an opening leaf (14) articulated to this casing by

means of hinges (1), each hinge being constructed by
means of two adjacent cylindrical tubular hinge

knuckles (2, 3) through which a common hinge pin (32)
is engaged, these hinge knuckles each being secured to

a lateral plate (5) for fixing to the opening leaf and
the casing respectively, allowing the first to move

freely with respect to the second, characterized in
that each of the two hinge knuckles (2, 3) includes, in

its lateral fixing plate (5) respectively secured to
the opening leaf (14) and to the casing (28), and

extending parallel to its tubular element (4), a slot
(12, 13) in which to fit and immobilize a sealing

gasket (22, 29) projecting towards the outside of the
plate under this tubular element, so that in the

position in which the opening leaf bears against the
casing, the gaskets borne by the two plates are aligned

with one another, thus giving continuity of the sealing
at the hinge (1).
Assembly according to Claim 1, in an embodiment
in which the opening leaf (14) consists of a frame

formed of suitably connected metal profile sections,
characterized in that the fixing plate (5) of the hinge

knuckle (2) borne by this opening leaf exhibits an L-shaped
profile in cross-section, with an end branch (7)

fixed to a web (15) of the profile section, the other
branch (6) secured to the tubular element (4) bearing

the slot (12) for accommodating the gasket (22), which
slot is extended, in the profile section of the opening

leaf, by a slot (21) of the same cross-section provided
in a support tenon (20) secured to this profile

section, so that the sealing gasket (22) can be fitted
continuously in the slots (12, 21) in the extension of

one another.
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the profile section of the 

opening leaf (14) has an outside edge (19)
perpendicular to the plane of the web (15) and against

which the end fixing part (7) of the hinge knuckle (2)
of the hinge (1) bears, this outer edge being secured

to the tenon (20) equipped with the slot (21) for
accommodating the gasket (22).
Assembly according to Claim 3, characterized
in that the outside edge (19) of the profile section is

extended by an enveloping end (36) externally
surrounding, at least in part, the tubular element (4)

of the hinge knuckle (2) borne by the opening leaf
(14).
Assembly according to one of Claims 3 and 4,
characterized in that the outer edge (19) of the

profile section of the opening leaf (14) includes,
beyond the hinge knuckle (2) borne by this profile

section, a second tenon (24) aligned with the first one
(20), formed as a continuation of the latter on the

profile section, and in which an extension (26) of the
sealing gasket (22) is fitted, the distance separating

the two tenons being substantially equal to the width
of the fixing plate (5) of the hinge knuckle (3) borne

by the casing (28), which fits into it when the opening
leaf is pressed against the casing.
