<ABSTRACT>
A method of making a composite board having a front and a back in a 
mould (10,12) includes the steps of: 


(a) applying a layer of a first composition (14,16) comprising a thermosetting 
resin and a catalyst for the thermosetting resin, to the surface of the 

mould (10,12); 
(b) allowing the thermosetting resin to polymerize to form the front of 
the composite board; 
(c) applying a layer of a connecting composition (24) comprising an adhesive 
or a second composition comprising a thermosetting resin and a 

catalyst for the thermosetting resin, to the inner surface of the front 
of the composite board in the mould; 
(d) placing a structure comprising one or more laminae (28), each lamina 
comprising first and second sheets of a natural fibre material and a 

corrugated sheet or a cellular core of a natural fibre material 
sandwiched between the first and second sheets, the lamina having 

been impregnated with a third composition comprising a 
thermosetting resin, an extending liquid for the thermosetting resin 

and a catalyst for the thermosetting resin, the thermosetting resin 
having been polymerized, on the connecting layer of step (c); and 
(e) allowing the connecting composition to set to join the structure to the 
front of the composite board to form the composite board, and 

removing the composite board from the mould. 
In another embodiment of the method, a layer of a fibrous reinforcing 
material (18) wetted with a fourth composition comprising a thermosetting resin 

and a catalyst for this thermosetting resin may be interposed between the 
layer of the first composition (14,16) and the structure (28), using a layer of a connecting 

composition (24), to join the various layers together. The method produces a 
composite board which may be used as a door or as a building board.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of making a composite board and to the 
composite board so made. Many types of composite boards, for use as building components such as 
doors, as furniture components such as door or cupboard fronts, and the 
like are known. Examples of these boards include plywood boards, wood 
particle or fibre boards, gypsum boards, fibre reinforced cement boards and 
solid timber boards. All of these boards have their advantages and 
disadvantages.  
 There is however always a need for a new type of composite board with a 
good strength to weight ratio, whose surfaces are seamless, weather and 
abrasion resistant, and which can conform to any surface profile or simulate 
different types of material and which board his the necessary dimensional 
stability, stiffness, impact resistance and ease of decoration. According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a method of 
making a composite board having a front and a back in a mould which 
includes the steps of: 
(a) applying a layer of a first composition comprising a thermosetting 
resin and a catalyst for the thermosetting resin, to the surface of the 
mould; (b) allowing the thermosetting resin to polymerize to form the front of 
the composite board; (c) applying a layer of a connecting composition comprising an adhesive 
or a second composition comprising a thermosetting resin and a 
catalyst for the thermosetting resin, to the back surface of the front 
of the composite board in the mould; 
and either (d) placing a structure comprising one or more laminae, each lamina 
comprising first and second sheets of a natural fibre material and a 
corrugated sheet or a cellular core of a natural fibre material 
sandwiched between the first and second sheets, the lamina having  
 
been impregnated with a third composition comprising a 
thermosetting resin, an extending liquid for the thermosetting resin 
and a catalyst for the thermosetting resin, the thermosetting resin 
having been polymerized, on the connecting layer of step (c) to form 
the back of the board; and (e) allowing the connecting composition to set to join the structure to the 
front of the composite board to form the composite board, and 
removing the composite board from the mould; 
or (f) applying to the layer of step (c) a layer of a fibrous reinforcing 
material wetted with a fourth composition comprising a thermosetting 
resin and a catalyst for the thermosetting resin, and allowing the 
thermosetting resin to polymerise and allowing the connecting
