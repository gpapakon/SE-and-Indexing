<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a bone-extending device comprising at least two frame elements (12) located a certain distance apart and at least partly surrounding the bone and which are designed to hold the bone securely in place, fastener elements (14) extending across approximately at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the bone, and telescopically extendable clamping or similar elements (16) which connect the frame elements to each other and fix the positions of the frame elements with respect to each other. Each of the frame elements (12) is U-shaped, half-oval or of another, similar, shape and has at least one, preferably two or more, rows (18, 18') of elongated slots (20, 20', 20'') for securing the fastener elements (14) and clamping elements (16) in position.

wires (24).
Device according to claim 6,

characterised in that

the clamp screws (26) are respectively so designed that the
clamp screws (26) for the spit wires (24) come into contact

over a large area and thus in a rotationally stable manner on
the frame member (12). 
Device according to claim 6 or 7,

characterised in that

the clamp screws (26) are of a two-part design, one part (30)
comprising a screw (32) and a helical thread (34), between

which is located a projection (36) with a bore, preferably a
central bore (38) for receiving the spit wire (24) with a

diameter which is smaller than the diameter of the screw head
(32) and larger than the diameter of the helical thread (34),

and the other part (40) representing a clamp disc (42) with a
side (44) facing the screw head (32) and acting on the spit

wire, and with a side (46) facing away from the screw head (32)
and abutting with its surface on the frame member (12).
Device according to claim 8,

characterised in that

the clamp screw (42) has a recess (48) corresponding to the
projection (36) and receiving it.
Device according to claim 8 or 9,

characterised in that

the clamp disc (42) is provided on its side (44) facing the
screw head (32) with at least two notches (50) or grooves,

facing one another diametrically and extending radially, for
partly accommodating the spit wire (24) passing through the

projection (36). 
Device according to claims 6 to 10,

characterised in that

the clamp screws 926) are respectively lockable by means of a
nut (28), which comprises a tiltable disc (52) coming into

contact with the frame member (12).
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 11,

characterised in that

the telescopically extensible clamp members (16) connecting the
frame members (12) together and fixing them relative to one

another comprise at least two, preferably three threaded
sections (54,56,58) which engage at least partly in one
