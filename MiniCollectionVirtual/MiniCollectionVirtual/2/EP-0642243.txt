<ABSTRACT>
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) based on Direct Sequence 
Spread Spectrum (DSSS) permits good multipath diversity by the use 

of the so-called rake receiver. When multipath codes are sent over 
the same link (to increase the transmission rate for that link without 

altering the basic transmission format) multiple rake receivers would 
normally be required. This invention involves the rake combining 

operation prior to code correlation in order to make only a single 
rake processor necessary. This affords significant savings in 

complexity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to radio communication systems, and 
more especially it relates to 'code division multiple access' (CDMA) 
systems. Many CDMA systems are based on "direct sequence spread 
spectrum" (DSSS), wherein different system users are each assigned a 
unique spreading code thereby to achieve multiple access. In order 
to make beneficial use of significant multipath components, DSSS 
systems may use a so called rake receiver. This involves relatively 
simple technology which permits multipath propagation to be 
exploited fully. Essentially, in a rake receiver significant multipath 
components are each resolved by a separate correlator and combined 
in some fashion prior to detection. This process allows significant 
multipath diversity, which is inherent in wideband spread spectrum 
signals, to be fully exploited. In general rake receivers are much 
simpler than equalisers, because the signal energy of different paths 
can be combined without the need for eliminating multipath 
interference or inter symbol interference. This arises because 
multipath interference is suppressed by the processing gain 
associated with the spreading process. However, achieving adequate 
processing gain whereby multipath interference can be ignored 
requires significant spreading factors, e.g. gains of 50 or more. In flexible CDMA systems, it may be necessary to allow some 
users more capacity than the capacity provided by a single channel 
running with a normal spreading factor. It is clearly desirable that  
 
all transmissions should occupy the full bandwidth from the 
viewpoint of commonalty of RF hardware and interference spectra. 
In view of this constraint there are two principle options available to 
achieve increased capacity. 
(a) To increase the transmission rate whilst retaining the same 
spread bandwidth (reduce the spreading factor); or (b) To transmit a plurality of different codes over the same link, 
one code for each channel, whereby the link is afforded increased 
capacity. Option (a) cannot in general be considered because a significant 
reduction in the spreading factor would introduce multipath 
interference at an unacceptable level. The only viable option 
therefore, is option (b). This however, with known systems involves 
the use of a multiplicity of rake receivers one for each code which 
would introduce undesirable complexity. The present invention has for an object to provide a radio 
communication system which uses DSSS, CDMA, and which in 
operation will support a multiplicity of

<CLAIMS>
A CDMA radio communication system using DSSS for channel 
discrimination wherein a different spreading code is used for each 

channel, comprising a rake receiver for combining received multipath 
signals to produce a single combined signal and despreading means 

responsive to the combined signal for producing output signals one 
for each channel, a plurality of channels being used for one link. 
A system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the despreading means 
comprises a correlator.
