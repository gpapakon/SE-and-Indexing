<ABSTRACT>
Activity on a digital communication network (10) is divided into 
periodic 

intervals and during a segment of each periodic interval a moderator 
station 

broadcasts a numerical count of the periodic intervals to all stations 
(12-16) on the 

network. Each station has a memory in which a numerical value is 
stored, and a 

comparator that compares the numerical value to the numerical count 
received 

from the network. When the numerical count of the periodic intervals 
equals 

the numerical value, an apparatus within the station performs a defined 
operation, such as transmitting a message over the network or 

synchronizing a 
clock in the station to a master time standard. The equality of 

the periodic 
interval count and the numerical value also can be used to determine 

when to 
signal an external device. By using the count of the periodic intervals 

in this 
manner, the operation of several stations (12-16) on the network can be 

coordinated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to digital communications networks, and
more particularly, to temporal coordination of when data is exchanged over the
network and when recipients execute commands sent over the network.Factories are automated by controllers that are programmed, or configured,
to operate specific machines or devices. These controllers may be general
purpose, such as computers, numerical controls or programmable controllers; or
they may be special purpose controllers, such as robot controllers, weld controllers
or motor drives.Each controller connects to the various sensing devices and operating
devices on the machinery which it controls and it automates the operation of
that machinery by inputting data from the sensing devices and outputting the
appropriate data to the operating devices. This exchange of input and output
("I/O") data between the controller and the devices on the controlled machinery
is often accomplished by direct connections between ports on the controller and
each separate I/O device. However, when I/O devices are physically spread out
over a large area, the wiring costs associated with such separate connections can
become excessive.One way to reduce wiring in such applications is to multiplex I/O data
through a serial communications link. Such serial I/O links are commonly used
to connect the centrally located controller to separate remote racks, or chassis,
that are positioned adjacent to the I/O devices. Such "remote I/O systems" are
disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,404,651; 4,413,319; 4,809,217 and
4,750,150, where the controller carries out a continuous high speed scan of the
I/O data associated with each remote rack and that data is conveyed through the
serial communications link. It can be appreciated that such serial I/O links must
promptly and reliably convey the I/O data, since that data is directly controlling
operating devices on a machine that is operating in real time. While a single controller may automate a machine, or a
small group of machines, such "islands of automation" must be
connected together to truly automate an entire factory. These
latter connections are provided by industrial local area
networks that enable each controller to send messages to other
similar controllers in the factory over serial data links.
There are a large number of such "peer-to-peer" communications
networks known in the art, some of which are developed by
standards committees like IEEE 802.3, IEEE 802.4, IEEE 802.5
and MAP; and others are developed by
