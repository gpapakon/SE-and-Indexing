<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for injecting gases in landfills, water and sewerage works or bodies of water. The device serves to clean up contaminated soils or bodies of water and has a cylindrical gas tank (10) accommodating a pressure piston (13). Located in the gas tank (10) is a space (15) for a treatment gas and a space (14) above the piston for a counterpressure gas. A pneumatically reversible control piston is located in a valve housing (20) below the gas tank (10). The space (15) in the gas tank can be filled in one position of the control piston, and the treatment gas can be injected in a pulsating manner through the injection tube (2) into the landfill soil or the body of water in the other position of the control piston. The pneumatic reversal eliminates the risk of explosion, which is otherwise present during electrical reversal.

Device for injecting gases in the ground, water plants 
and waste water plants or waters comprising a gas tank which 

is connected to a supply line and from which an injecting 
tube lead into the ground is starting, further comprising 

a pressure piston which is axially movable in a cylinder 
space, in a space above the pressure piston a counter pressure 

being produced by means of gas and in one position of the 
pressure piston the treatment gas being able to flow suddenly 

from the gas tank (10) into the injecting tube, whereas in 
another posit
ion of the pressure piston the connection between 
the interior of the gas tank and the injecting tube being 

closed, characterised by the following features: 

the pressure piston (13) is movable up and down in the 
cylinder space of the gas tank (10) and divides this cylinder 

space in a space (15) below the pressure piston 
for accommodating the treatment gas and a space (14) above 

the pressure piston for accommodating the gas for counter 
pressure; below the gas tank (10) a valve chamber (20) 

is provided comprising a connecting socket (21) for the 
Injecting tube (2) with a connecting socket (22) for the 

supply line (4) as well as a main channel (16) leading 
to the cylinder space (15) below the pressure piston (13); 
the valve chamber (20) accommodates a control piston (25) 
which is movable transversely to the main channel (16) 

and to the moving direction of the pressure piston (13) 
against a spring force, the control piston (25) clearing 

a line from the connecting socket (22) to the main channel 
(16) for filling the gas tank in one stop position; 
in the valve chamber (20) there is provided a bypass 
channel (33) which leads from the cylinder space (15)  

 
to a secondary chamber (31) for the passage of treatment 

gas by means of which the control piston (25) is moved 
against the spring pressure from the stop position into 

an injecting position when reaching a reversing pressure, 
in said injecting position the connecting socket (22) for 

the supply being closed and a line from the main channel 
(16) to the connecting socket (21) for the injecting tube 

(2) being cleared. 
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that between 
the bypass channel (33) and the secondary chamber (31) 

there is incorporated a regulating device for adjusting a 
reversing pressure 
Device as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that the 
regulating device for the reversing pressure is formed by 

a control ball (29), an associated spring (30) and an adjusting 
screw (30a). 
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that in 
the piston sleeve (24) jet orifices (24a, 24b, 24c) are formed. 
Device as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that annular 
spaces (25a, 25b) are formed in the control piston. 
Device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that in the lower end region of the injecting tube 

(2) there is arranged a blast head (40) for the discharge 
of the treatment gas comprising several, preferably four, 

jets (41) arranged on a ring and distributed over the circumference.  
 
Device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that the jets (41) comprise an outlet orifice approximately 

of the size of a needle head for the treatment gas, 
particularly comprising a diameter of 0.05 to 0.3 mm, preferably 

between 0.1 to 0.2 mm. 
Device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised 
in that the diameter of the jet orifices is variable 

by exchanging the jets (41). 
Device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, characterised 
in that the injecting tube (2) comprises at a distance 

from its lower end a further jet head (43) with further jets 
(44) radially distributed over the circumference, said jets 

being likewise exchangeable if required. 
Process for the sanitation of grounds, water plants and 
waste water plants or waters by injecting a treatment gas, 

characterised in that in this process a device according to 
any one of claims 1 to 9 is used.
