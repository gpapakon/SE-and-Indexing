<ABSTRACT>
A construction for automatically milking animals, 
such as cows, has a milking box (2) comprising a milking 

robot (19) with a movable robot head (21), said robot head 
serving as a carrier for one or a number of teat cups (22) 

and a detection member (24) for determining the position of 
the teats of the animals. The detection member (24) is 

disposed such that it is movable with respect to the robot 
head (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a construction
or a similar arrangement according to the preamble of
claim 1. In EP-A-0 229 682, the detection member is
attached to the robot head, which serves as a carrier for
one or a number of teat cups, and interferes with an
accurate determination of the position of the teats by the
detection member. EP-A-0 300 115 discloses a gripper for attaching teat cups and a linearly movable detection member. In order to facilitate this positional
determination and to perform it accurately, and to create
a more flexible system, the construction of the type as
described in the preamble is, according to the invention,
characterized in that the detection member (24) is attached to the frame of the milking box (2) capable of being moved in three directions.The detection member is then more in particular movable
in the vertical, transverse and longitudinal directions
with respect to the wall of the milking box.During coupling of the teat cups to the teats of
an animal, the detection member can be in a position at
one side of the teats, whilst the teat cups can be guided
by the robot head to the teats from another side of the
teats.In this situation, the detection member may
have been moved to a position near the rear side of the
udder passing between the hind legs, as well as near
the side of the udder from the side wall of the milking
box, whilst in both these cases the robot head can then
be guided rearwardly from the leading side, after having
been pivoted to under the animal. "From the rear side of
the milking box" means that the detection member can
be guided to the udder whilst passing between the hind
legs as well as passing along one of the hind legs, to the
side of the udder.For a better understanding of the invention and
its constructive details and to show how the same may
be carried into effect, reference will now be made by
way of example, to an embodiment shown in the accompanying
drawings, in which:
Figure 1 shows the lay-out of two boxes, the rear
one of which is arranged for selecting the animals,
possibly massaging and cleaning the udder of an
animal present in this box and feeding it with concentrate,
whereas the front box is arranged as a
milking box in which concentrate can also be supplied
to the animal;Figure 2 is a plan view of the milking box shown in
Figure 1;Figure 3 is a side view of this milking box;Figure 4 is a plan view of an alternative embodiment
of the milking box.Figure 1 shows two boxes 1 and 2 which are
contiguous to each other in the

A construction or a similar arrangement for automatically
milking animals, such as cows, having a

milking box (2) comprising a milking robot (19) with
a movable robot head (21), said robot head serving

as a carrier for one or a number of teat cups (22),
said milking box further comprising a detection

member (24) for determining the position of the
teats of the animals, the detection

member (24) and the robot head (21) being movable
independently of each other, 
characterized in that
 the detection member (24) is attached
to the frame of the milking box (2) capable

of being moved in three directions.
A construction as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the detection member (24) is movable into
the milking box (2) in one direction and that the

robot head (21) is movable into the milking box (2)
from another direction.
A construction as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the detection member (24) is disposed such
that it is movable in the vertical, transverse and longitudinal

directions.

claims, 
characterized in that
, during coupling of
the teat cups (22) to the teats of an animal, the

detection member (24) is in a position at one side of
the teats and the teat cups are guided by the robot

head (21) to the teats from another side of the teats.
A construction as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the detection member
(24) is movable into the milking box (2) at the

rear side of the milking box (2).
A construction as claimed in claim 5, 
characterized
in that
, during coupling of the teat cups (22) to the
teats of an animal, the detection member (24) is in

a position near the rear teats of the animal.
A construction as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the detection member
(24) is movable into the milking box (2) from the

A construction as claimed in claim 7, 
characterized
in that
, during coupling of the teat cups (22) to the
teats of an animal, the detection member (24) is in

a position near the side of the udder of the animal. 
A construction as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the detection member
(24) is disposed rotatably, more in particular

capable of reciprocating, about an upwardly
directed shaft.
A construction as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the detection member
