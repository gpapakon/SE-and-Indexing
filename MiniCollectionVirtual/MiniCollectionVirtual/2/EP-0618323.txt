<ABSTRACT>
To improve the washing behaviour of the laundry and to reduce the consumption of water, of washing agent and of energy, the laundry drum is accelerated, in one direction of rotation, to a first rotational speed (n1) clearly below the starting rotational speed and, in the other direction of rotation, to a second rotational speed (n2) clearly above the starting rotational speed.

<CLAIMS>
Method for improving the throughflow in and the washing effect on laundry to be
washed in a washing machine with a perforated laundry drum which is driven with

alternating directions of rotation, so-called reversing operation, for a time during the
washing and/or rinsing process, characterised in that the laundry drum is accelerated in

the one rotational direction (-) to a first rotational speed (n1) significantly below the laying-on
rotational speed and in the other rotational direction (+) to a second rotational speed

(n2) significantly above the laying-on rotational speed.
Method according to claim 1 with entraining members, which have a scooping
effect, arranged in the drum, characterised in that the first rotational speed (n1) is applied

in that rotational direction (-) and set to that rotational speed value, for example 35
revolutions per minute, for which the scooping effect is greatest.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the second rotational speed
(n2) lies significantly below the resonance rotational speed.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the laundry
drum is accelerated at least in the other rotational direction (+) slowly to the nominal

rotational speed, for example 100 revolutions per minute, by means of a so-called gentle
running-up circuit.
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that the nominal value (n1) of the
first rotational speed is approximately equal to 35 revolutions per minute.
Method according to claim 3, characterised in that the nominal value (n2) of the
second rotational speed is approximately equal to 100 revolutions per minute.
Washing machine for the performance of the method according to one of the
claims 1 to 4, with a control equipment for the rotational speed of the drive motor of the

laundry drum, characterised in that the control equipment is constructed to be settable with
a view to the rotational speed values for the reversing operation in such a manner that the

laundry drum is accelerated in the one rotational direction (-) to a first rotational speed (n1)
significantly below the laying-on rotational speed and in the other rotational direction (+) to

a second rotational speed (n2) significantly above the laying-on rotational speed. 
Washing machine according to claim 7, with an equipment for ascertaining the
quantity of the introduced laundry load, characterised in that the nominal values (n1 and

n2) of the rotational speeds are settable in dependence on the quantity of the laundry load.
