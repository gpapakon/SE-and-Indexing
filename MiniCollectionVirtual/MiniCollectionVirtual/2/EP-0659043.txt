<ABSTRACT>
A valve for use in a line for transporting slurry comprises a housing (1) defining a valve port through which slurry is to pass. The housing (1) is formed with a concave lower end (2) which forms the valve seat adjacent the valve port and a valve closure member having an outer convex surface (5) complementary in shape to the concave surface of the valve seat is provided to close the valve. A float (7) is connected to the valve closure member (3) and is adapted to float on the surface of the slurry and open and close the valve in response to the slurry surface level. The valve closure member (3) has a sharpened and/or hardened edge to cut through solid matter in the slurry.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A VALVEThe present invention relates to a valve. The valve is particularly, but not exclusively, intended for agricultural use.For hygienic reasons, it is now common to store agricultural slurry to a large tank. In one known arrangement a pit is provided adjacent the tank. Slurry may be deposited in the pit prior to being introduced into the tank and slurry may be removed from the tank by way of the pit. An inlet pipe leads from the pit to the top of the tank, and a pump is provided for pumping slurry from the pit through the pipe into the tank. An outlet from the tank leads from the bottom of the tank to the pit. A valve is provided in the outlet to control the flow of slurry from the tank. This valve is very important. If it malfunctions the entire contents of the tank may flow out of the tank into the pit and thence onto the surrounding area with possible adverse consequences, particularly if the tank is disposed near a watercourse. Slurry is by nature a mixture of liquids and solids. The solids may take the form of straw and the like. These solids may be bound together by the liquids to form solid accumulations of larger size which may cause blockages in pipelines and may interfere with the operation of pipeline valves. 

 According to the present invention, there is provided a valve for use in a line for transporting slurry comprising a housing defining a port and a valve seat, a valve closure member having an edge mounted for movement across the valve seat between a position in which the port is open and a position in which the port is closed off and means for moving the valve closure member between the two positions.In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the valve seat is concave and advantageously is formed by the internal surface of part of a cylinder. The valve closure member is convex and is also advantageously formed by the external surface of part of a hollow cylinder, the two surfaces being complementary to one another. The wall of the part hollow cylinder forms the edge of the valve closure member. The edge may be hardened and/or sharpened to provide a cutting edge for solids in slurry flowing through the valve. This edge may be angled relative to the edge of the valve seat to produce a scissors type cutting action as the closure member moves across the valve seat to close the valve. The mounting for the valve closure member comprises support members to which the valve closure member is pivotally connected. These supports are connected to the housing. The means for moving the valve

CLAIMS
1. A valve for use in a line for transporting slurry comprising a housing (1) defining a port and a valve seat (2) , characterised by a valve closure member (3) having an edge (20) mounted for movement across the valve seat between a position in which the port is open and a position in which the port is closed off and means for moving the valve closure member between the two positions.
2. A valve as claimed in claim 1, in which the valve seat (2) is concave.
3. A valve as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which the valve seat (2) is formed by the internal surface of part of a cylinder.
4. A valve as claimed in claim 3, in which the valve closure member (3) is convex and is formed by the external surface of part of a hollow cylinder, the said external surface and internal surfaces being complementary to each other.
5. A valve as claimed in claim 3, in which the wall of the hollow part cylinder forms the edge (20) of the valve closure member. 


6. A valve as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the edge (20) is hardened and/or sharpened to provide a cutting edge.
7. A valve as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the edge (20) of the valve closure member (3) is angled relative to an edge of the valve seat (2) to produce a scissors type cutting action as the closure member (3) moves across the valve seat to close the valve.
8. A valve as claimed in any preceding claim, in which support members are connected to the housing and to the valve closure member to mount the valve closure member on the housing.
9. A valve as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the means for moving the valve closure member comprises a float.
10. A valve as claimed in claim 9, in which the float is cylindrical or spherical.
11. A valve as claimed in claim 9 or 10, in which the float has a non-stick surface to reduce any tendency of matter to adhere to it. 


12. A valve as claimed in claim 11, in which the non-stick surface comprises polytetrafluoroethylene.
