including a cross-shaped TM dual mode dielectric resonator 

provided in an electrically conductive case, the cross-shaped 
dielectric resonator being comprised of first and 

second dielectric resonators, mode coupling means such as 
at least one groove, at least one concave or the like for 

coupling an operation of the first dielectric resonator 
with that of the second dielectric resonator is formed in 

the TM dual mode dielectric resonator. At least one first 
projection of a dielectric material for adjusting a 

coupling coefficient between the two dielectric resonators 
is formed on a portion of the crossing portion, wherein an 

adjustment amount of the coupling coefficient when the 
first projection is removed is previously determined.

projections of dielectric materials for adjusting resonance 

frequencies of the first and second dielectric resonators

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dielectric
resonator apparatus and methods for respectively adjusting
a coupling coefficient and a resonance frequency of a
dielectric resonator apparatus, and in particular, a TM
dual mode dielectric resonator apparatus and methods for
respectively adjusting a coupling coefficient between two
dielectric resonators of a TM dual mode dielectric
resonator apparatus and respective resonance frequencies of
the two dielectric resonators thereof.Fig. 1 shows a conventional TM dual mode
resonator apparatus 1 comprising a cross-shaped TM dual
mode resonator 2, which is disclosed in the Japanese patent
Laid-open publication No. 63-313901.Referring to Fig. 1, in the conventional TM dual
mode resonator apparatus 1, there is provided or mounted
the TM dual mode resonator 2 within an electrically
conductive case 3 which functions as a waveguide. The TM 
dual mode resonator 2 is made of a dielectric ceramic
material, and is constituted by integrally forming two TM
mode rectangular-parallelepiped-shaped dielectric
resonators 4A and 4B in a cross shape so that the
longitudinal direction of the dielectric resonator 4A is
perpendicular to that of the dielectric resonator 4B.
Further, electrically conductive layers (not shown) such as
Ag thick films or the like are formed on both end surfaces
of the respective dielectric resonators 4A and 4B, the
conductive layers are soldered onto inner surfaces of the
case 3 so as to be electrically connected thereto. In
a crossing portion of the two dielectric resonators 4A and
4B (referred to as a crossing portion hereinafter) formed
in a cross shape, coupling grooves 5 for coupling an
operation mode of the dielectric resonator 4A with that of
the dielectric resonator 4B are formed so as to have
longitudinal lengths each from the front surface of the
dielectric resonators 4A and 4B to the back surface
thereof, and so as to have depths each extending from two
corners of the crossing portion which oppose each other
toward the center of the crossing portion in a diagonal
direction of the crossing portion.Fig. 2 shows:
(a) electric lines E1 and E2 of force of the
respective dielectric resonators 4A and 4B parallel to 
respective longitudinal directions thereof which are
indicated by alternate long and short dash lines;(b) electric lines Ee of force of the even mode
extending from the left end of the dielectric resonator 4B
through the crossing portion of the two dielectric
resonators 4A and 4B to the top end of the dielectric
resonator 4A and vice versa,
