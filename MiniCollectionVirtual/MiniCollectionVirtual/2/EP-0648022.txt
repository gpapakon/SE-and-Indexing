<ABSTRACT>
An audio-visual system includes an AV centre which
may be connected to a plurality of image source components.

An AV bus cable is connected respectively between each of
the image source components and the AV centre. The

configuration of the interconnections between the AV centre
and all components of the system are identical and of

simplified layout. Thus, complex interconnective methods
and excessive numbers of cable, connectors, etc., are

avoided while user convenience and the general appearance of
the system are greatly enhanced without compromising overall

system functionality and/or operational capabilities. The
system ensures that bus terminators are correctly enabled

and disabled as required for a particular system
configuration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
audio-visual system, and in particular to an audio-visual 
system including a bus for interconnection of various 
components thereof. Recently, audio-visual (AV) systems have been 
introduced in which control of various system components may 
be effected in accordance with operating instructions sent 
to an audio-visual centre. Fig. 17 of the accompanying 
drawings shows an example of such an conventional AV system 
with connecting bus. In Fig. 17 an AV centre 1 (such as a television 
monitor, or the like) is connected to a plurality of image 
sources 2a, 2b and 2c, which may, for example, include a 
video tape deck, a tuner, satellite decoder, etc. The AV 
centre 1 is connected individually to each of the image 
sources 2a, 2b, 2c respectively via signal cables 3 which 
generally include an video signal cable and audio signal 
cable (left and right audio cables may be provided for 
stereo audio). In addition, the AV centre 1 is connected in 
series to the image sources 2a-2c via bus cables 5 
interconnected via connectors 4. The bus cables generally 
include a - balance cable, + balance cable and ground cable. 
It will be noted that each of the image sources are provided 
with two connectors 4 for allowing series connection of the 
components and that an first (i.e. input) side connector 4, 
as well as the connector 4 of the AV centre 1 are provided 
with end resistance means (terminators) 6. The end 
resistance means 6 of the image sources 2a-2c are designed 
so as to be disabled in the case wherein bus cables are 
connected to both input and output sides of the component 
(2a -2c), and the end resistance 6 of the AV centre 1 is 
disabled according to the presence of a bus cable (output) 
being connected thereto. Thus, according to the system of  
 
Fig. 17, the end resistance means 6 of the AV centre 1 as 
well as of the image sources 2a and 2b are inactive due to 
the presence of the bus cables 5, while the end resistance 6 
of the image source 2c is active, since no bus cable 5 is 
connected to the output side thereof. According to the system as describe above, 
sufficient control of the AV system is possible. However, 
recently, since such sophisticated bus systems are becoming 
increasingly part of ordinary AV products, there is a desire 
to simplify interconnection arrangements for AV components 
in order to allow the average consumer to utilize such 
products with a minimum of confusion. For example, in the system described above, there 
is an
