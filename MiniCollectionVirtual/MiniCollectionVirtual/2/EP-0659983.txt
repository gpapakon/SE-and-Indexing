<ABSTRACT>
An integrated hydraulic system for controlling an 
engine valve control system wherein each of the 

reciprocating intake and/or exhaust valves (10) is 
hydraulically controlled and selectively connected to a 

source of high pressure fluid (40) and a source of low 
pressure fluid (42), and a hydraulically assisted 

turbocharger (80) selectively connected to a high pressure 
source of fluid by a solenoid valve (36), with the 

turbocharger (80) including a nozzle jet (90) and an impulse 
type turbine (88).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to hydraulic systems in
motor vehicle engines, and more particularly to systems for
hydraulically controlling internal combustion engine intake
and exhaust valves and turbochargers.The increased use and reliance on microprocessor
control systems for automotive vehicles and increased
confidence in hydraulic as opposed to mechanical systems is
making substantial progress in engine systems design
possible. Electrohydraulic systems in vehicles provide more
flexibility to increase engine performance, with a drawback
that now more systems will need a source of pressurised
hydraulic fluid to operate. These separate systems can take
up much room and add weight as well as creating parasitic
losses. This is especially true for those systems which
only occasionally require pressurised hydraulic fluid.One such electrohydraulic system is a control for
engine intake and exhaust valves. The enhancement of engine
performance to be attained by being able to vary the
acceleration, velocity and travel time of the intake and
exhaust valve in an engine is well known and appreciated in
the art. This allows one to account for various engine
operating conditions through independent control of each
valve to optimise engine performance. This type of system
typically requires a constant supply of pressurised
hydraulic fluid to operate.Another type of electrohydraulic system provides
hydraulic assist to a turbocharger to improve the response
time of the turbocharger under certain engine operating
conditions. At low engine operating speeds and during
increasing load conditions, the effectiveness of a
turbocharger as a means to quickly boost the engine air
supply is rather low. Only after some initial increase in
engine speed and power has already been achieved, does the
turbocharger become an effective means for further increase 
in engine power. Adding a hydraulic turbine wheel to the
turbocharger can substantially alleviate this problem. Such
a turbine, which can be selectively activated by supplying
it with pressurised oil for brief periods during which the
energy supplied by the exhaust gas is too low, can
significantly improve the response of the
engine/turbocharger system. The problem with adding a
hydraulic turbine to a turbocharger is that it also requires
installation of a high pressure hydraulic system, which adds
additional cost and complexity to the vehicle. This is
especially true because this hydraulic system would only be
needed occasionally.In an engine where a hydraulic system already
