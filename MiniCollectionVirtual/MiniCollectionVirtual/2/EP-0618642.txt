<ABSTRACT>
Dielectric strips (12) made of a dielectric material 
are placed between a pair of conductor plates (1, 

2) located a specified distance apart. Cutouts (14) are 
formed in the dielectric strips. By means of the 

cutouts, a part of each dielectric strip is formed into 
an electrically asymmetric portion. When high-frequency 

power is supplied to the dielectric strips, the power is 
transmitted through an NRD waveguide composed of the 

dielectric strips and the pair of conductor plates, with 
the result that electromagnetic wave is radiated from 

the cutouts (14) into the space between the conductor 
plates (1, 2). This electromagnetic wave excites the 

radiation elements (17) formed in the conductor plates 
(2), which then radiate electromagnetic waves.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electromagnetic 
radiator for radiating and receiving electromagnetic waves according to the preamble of claim 1 or 2. 
More specifically, 
this invention relates to an electromagnetic radiator 
that features a compact design and a simple configuration 
and assures high efficiency up to a high-frequency 
band. A radiator of this invention is used as a receiving 
antenna for satellite broadcasting, an electromagnetic 
radiator for a car anti-collision unit, and a 
write/read transducer for IC cards, identification 
tags, and others. Coaxial lines, microstrip lines, triplate lines, 
metal waveguides, and the like have been used as power 
feed lines for antennas or the like. Those power feed 
lines have the disadvantage that their loss becomes 
greater as the frequency of a carrier, such as 
millimeter wave, gets higher. The metal waveguides 
are difficult to miniaturize because of their 
configuration. Recently, there have been demands that electromagnetic 
radiators such as antennas should be made compact 
for various uses and operate efficiently even at high 
frequencies. For example, the popularization of satellite 
broadcasting has been requiring more compact, highly 
efficient satellite-broadcasting receiving antennas.  
 
So-called IC cards, which are cards incorporating 
integrated circuits, are also being popularized. Most 
conventional IC cards use contact-type data write/read 
transducers. Since such a contact type is less 
reliable, non-contact type transducers are desirable. 
By incorporating in such IC cards transducers capable of 
remotely writing and reading at a distance several to 
several tens of meters apart, IC cards of this type can 
be used as identification cards for individuals or cars, 
which makes it possible to construct an effective security 
management system. Further, by installing such IC 
cards on pallets, containers, or the like, a distribution 
management system can be constructed. Still 
further, now under consideration is the construction of 
a traffic control system where cars are provided with 
small antennas and data is exchanged between such cars 
and transmitter-receivers installed along the roads to 
provide traffic control and traffic information. 
Additionally, an anti-collision radar system is also 
under consideration which requires cars to be provided 
with small antennas that prevent them from colliding 
against each other. It is desirable that electromagnetic radiators such 
as antennas or transducers used in systems as
