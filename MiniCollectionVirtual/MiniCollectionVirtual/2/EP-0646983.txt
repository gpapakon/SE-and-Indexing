<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a microstrip patch antenna for emitting 
backscatter-modulated signals in response to a received signal. 

The antenna has two segments that are connected together by a 
switch. When the switch is ON, the antenna is a full wave length 

antenna with its two segments out-of-phase with each other, thus 
producing minimal backscatter. When the switch is OFF, the two 

segments of the antenna act in concert with each other to produce 
a backscatter-modulated signal. Multiple pairs of such antennas 

can be connected together to make a single antenna with increased 
signal power.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an antenna system in a transponder
for modulating RF signals from a reader and reflecting the modulated
signals back to the reader to pass information from the
transponder to the reader, and for receiving RF signals from the
reader and decoding data to be written into the transponder's
memory.Systems for remote identification of objects are being used
for many purposes, such as identifying vehicles passing through a
toll station on a highway or identifying cargo containers located
on board a ship. Such systems use RF signals to communicate
information between a reader apparatus and a transponder attached
to the object. Some systems include both "read" and "write"
functions; that is, the reader apparatus can read information
previously stored in the transponder's memory and the transponder
can also write new information into the its memory in response to
signals from the reader.Each transponder has an individual code containing information
related to and identifying the associated container. The reader
sends an RF signal to the remote transponder. An antenna in the
transponder receives the signal from the reader, backscatter-modulates
the received signal with data temporarily or permanently 
stored in the transponder (such as data indicating the
identity and contents of the object to which the
transponder is attached), thereby producing a sequence of
signals in accordance with the transponder's individual
code, and reflects this modulated signal back to the reader
to pass the information contained in the transponder to the
reader. The reader decodes these signals to obtain the
information from the transponder. Likewise, the
transponder may decode signals received from the reader and
write information to the transponder's memory. Except for
the novel features of this invention, the details of these
transponders and readers are not described herein because
they have been previously described in one or more of U.S.

reference.Also, in W092/10765, there is disclosed a microwave
identification system utilising responders into at least
two antenna elements which are interconnected via a
modulation device.The systems now in use have had certain
difficulties. One difficulty has resulted from the limited
range of transmission of the identifying signals from the
transponder to the reader. Another related difficulty has
resulted from RF interference. Interference produced by
