<ABSTRACT>
A DRAM cell is dislosed which can compensate for the reduction of 
storage voltage caused by the threshold voltage loss of a cell transistor 

without using word line boost. The memory cell has a capacitor for 
charge pumping which is connected to a common junction between a MOS cell 

transistor and a cell capacitor which are connected in series. The other 
end of the charge pump capacitor is connected to a control line which is 

driven during writing so as to boost the storage voltage in the cell 
capacitor. When the cell transistor is PMOS, the control line is driven 

by a positive voltage pulse such that the storage voltage for a low level 
is boosted in negative direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a DRAM cell of MOS structure, and more 
particularly to a DRAM cell with a charge pump function to increase the 
storage voltage in memory cell. Conventionally, a DRAM (dynamic random access memory) performs 
writing in a cell capacitor through an NMOS or PMOS charge transfer gate. 
Therefore, when the cell transistor is driven between a power supply (VDD) 
and ground (GND), threshold voltage loss causes the high level, for 
example, bit "1" to be VDD - VTN for NMOS, or the low level, for example, 
bit "0" to be |VTP| for PMOS, both of which inhibit full rail writing of 
VDD - GND, where VTN and VTP are threshold voltages of NMOS and PMOS, 
respectively. Full rail writing can be usually performed by a word line 
boost. That is, the gate is driven to a voltage higher than (VDD + VTN) 
for the NMOS cell transistor, or to a voltage lower than (GND - VTP) for 
the PMOS cell transistor. Usually, this word line boost approach is 
widely used for NMOS. U.S. - A - 4,678,941 discloses a word line clock circuit which 
negatively drives the word line in order to compensate for the threshold 
voltage loss in the PMOS cell transistor. However, when an NMOS 
transistor is used for the word line driver and the word line is boosted 
to a voltage lower than GND, there is a possibility that the junction 
between the substrate and a device region of the NMOS transistor will be 
forward biased thus giving rise to latch-up. Therefore, only a small 
amount of boost can essentially be allowed so as not to cause latch-up. 
To increase the boost, special considerations to prevent latch-up become 
necessary. Although the latch-up problem can be eliminated by using PMOS 
as the word line driver, PMOS is not desirable because it has a low 
driving capability at low voltages, and cannot access at high speed. Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application 57-18081 discloses 
a DRAM cell which increases the amount of signal charge stored in the 
cell capacitor by controlling the potential of an electrode of the cell 
capacitor. The cell capacitor is formed by a diffusion region of the 
cell transistor and a plate electrode provided on this diffusion region 
with an insulating layer therebetween. During writing, a voltage higher  
 
than full rail can be written by controlling the potential of the plate 
electrode. However, in DRAMs using a trench capacitor, the substrate is 
used as a capacitor electrode corresponding to the above-mentioned plate 
electrode. The substrate is usually connected to a
