Hv 80 or higher to about 250 or lower, the iron powder 
having been atomized with water and dried, and having a 

particle surface covered with oxides which are reducible 
in a sintering atmosphere, and which has an oxygen 

content of 1.0 wt% or less. 
The water-atomized ion powder can be made by an 
improved and simplified processing, and the cost of 

resulting sintered products is decreased as a result of 
its use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an iron powder
useful in water-atomized powder metallurgy, and further
relates to a method of manufacturing the iron powder.In general, water-atomized iron powder is made by
atomizing molten steel with high pressure water. This is
often followed by annealing, softening and reducing,
removing oxide film from particle surfaces, and crushing.
Performance of all of these steps is considered
necessary. Thus, the possibility of cost reduction by
eliminating processing steps is limited.When sintered parts are made of iron powder, it is
necessary to compact the iron powder with addition of
lubricant and additive alloy component powders, followed
by sintering the resulting green compact at a high
temperature and further sizing for dimensional
adjustment. Accordingly, the cost of the entire process
is further increased.Cost reduction is important. Every effort must be
made to reduce manufacturing costs of, for example,
automobile parts. For that purpose substantial efforts
have been made.However, omissions of any process steps, in
particular, omission of annealing, softening and reducing
steps has not been achieved because the water-atomized
iron powder is solid due to its quenched structure and is
difficult to compact. Further, although a considerable
amount of oxygen is introduced into the iron powder as a
sintering material, oxygen is generally considered
harmful to sintered parts. For example, although Japanese Patent Unexamined
Publication No. Sho 51-20760 discloses a method of
manufacturing iron powder in which molten steel is
produced in a converter and vacuum decarbonization
apparatus, this method includes annealing and reducing
powder atomized with water and drying.Further, Japanese Patent Examined Publication No.
Sho 56-45963 discloses a method of improving the
characteristics of iron powder by mixing a finished
powder that has been subjected to annealing and reducing
with an atomized raw iron powder that was not subjected
to annealing or reducing. Although it is desired to use
atomized raw iron powder not subjected to annealing or
reducing, predetermined characteristics cannot be
achieved by that powder alone.Further, although Japanese Patent Unexamined
Publication No. Sho 63-157804 discloses a process for
manufacturing atomized iron powder by suppressing
oxidization and carburizing as much as possible by the
addition of alcohol etc. to the atomizing water, the
resulting iron powder contains 0.01% or more of C and is
easily hardened at the cooling speed achieved by
