<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an 
apparatus for polishing a semiconductor wafer or the 
like and, more particularly, to a method for polishing a 
work piece and an apparatus for polishing the work piece 
to detect an end point of the polishing by monitoring a 
thickness of the wafer during the polishing. SOI (Silicon on Insulator) is expected for 
application to a high speed LSI because of features 
of radiation resistance, latchup resistance and low 
parasitic capacity. FIG. 26 shows a structure of a 
double gate MOS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor). Generally, 
the MOS is manufactured mainly through next six steps. 
That is, in step 1, a field oxide film B is arranged on 
a polycrystalline Si substrate A, and then a back gate 
oxide film C and a back gate electrode D are arranged by 
using ordinary gate forming technique. In step 2, a CVD 
(Chemical Vapor Deposition) oxide film E is deposited 
from the back gate oxide film C. In step 3, the CVD 
oxide film E is polished, and a step of the back gate is 
flatened. In step 4, a substrate F formed with the back 
gate and a support substrate G with BPSG (Boron-doped 
Phosphorus-Silicate Glass) are laminated by a pulse 
electrostatic bonding method. In step 5, the filed 
oxide film B is used as a stopper, the Si substrate A 
is ground and selectively polished, and a thin film Si 
portion K of a step of the field oxide film B is formed.  
 
In step 6, a source M, a drain N and a front gate Q of a 
front gate MOSFET are formed on the thin film Si portion 
K by an ordinary process. A thickness of a wafer is normally reduced from 
625 µm to about 400 µm by the selective polishing of the 
Si in the step 5. However, since a detection of an end 
point of the selective polishing is difficult, there 
arises a problem that overpolishing frequently occurs. 
A recess is produced on the thin film Si portion K by 
the overpolishing to disturb an improvement in a manufacturing 
yield. Therefore, the end point of the processing has been 
detected by managing a processing time to certain degree 
and then visually observing it for each short time. 
Thus, it not only deteriorates its efficiency but there 
is a large margin to cause a detecting error of the end 
point the processing. On the other hand, it is also 
considered to measure a thickness of a wafer by an optical 
method or an electric capacity method and to detect 
the end point of processing from the measured result. 
However, if a surface to be measured is contaminated 
with processing solution, a
