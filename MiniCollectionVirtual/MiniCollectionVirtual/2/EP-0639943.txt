<DESCRIPTION>
 ALKYL GLYCOSIDE COMPOSITIONS WITH IMPROVED WETTING PROPERTIESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONAt times it is desirable to provide a thin layer of a material on the surface of a substrate. This can be accomplished by providing a mixture of the material to be spread on the surface of the substrate with water. The spreading of the material is generally assisted by addition of a surfactant to the aqueous mixture to reduce the interfacial tension between the water and the substrate.Application of aqueous agricultural pesticide formulations to plant materials and particularly food crop materials has special requirements. When the material to be spread on the substrate is an insoluble solid or an insoluble oily solid or liquid substance, a surfactant is generally added to the oily or insoluble material and water so that a suspension or emulsion can be formed.Alkyl polyglycosides are known to be excellent surfactants for assisting in forming a mixture of water 

insoluble materials and water. In particular, organic polyglycosides are particularly useful as adjuvants for pesticidal materials (see U.S. 4,888,325, U.S. Serial No. 782,254 and statutory Invention Registration H 303). However, the organic polyglycosides which are the most effective in forming mixtures of the water soluble materials and water are generally materials which have poor wetting characteristics. That is, the organic polyglycosides which have the most favorable characteristics for forming uniform mixtures and suspensions are not the most effective in reducing the interfacial tension between the mixture and the substrate to which it is applied.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The wetting ability of an aqueous mixture containing an aliphatic polyglycoside and a material which is to be spread on the surface of a plant material, can be improved by including in the aqueous mixture of the aliphatic polyglycoside and the material to be spread on the plant material, a wetting improving amount of a fatty alcohol.When the material is required to penetrate a biological material, the addition of the fatty alcohol can improve the rate of penetration particularly when the surface of the substrate comprises an oily or wax-like surface layer. The aliphatic polyglycoside with the added fatty alcohol more rapidly wets the surface of the plant and aids in penetration of the waxy or oily surface by the 

aqueous material spread on the surface.Applicants have also discovered that aliphatic monoglycosides are particularly useful adjuvants in aqueous mixtures which
