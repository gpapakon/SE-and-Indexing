<ABSTRACT>
Strips (2) which are to be processed in a forming tool (1) are removed from a magazine (10) and placed on a guideway, on which they can be fed to the tool (1) and pushed through it in steps by means of a finger bar (3) with sprung driving fingers (4-8). By means of the programmable drive (12) for the finger bar (3), this finger bar can execute strokes in any desired direction and to different extents as desired in order to feed strips into the forming tool (1) and push them forward in steps through the latter. The strip feed device is simple in construction and can be adapted to meet a very wide variety of requirements merely by programming the drive (12) in the appropriate manner.

Method for feeding and advancing a strip (2) into
resp. through a forming tool (1) in which an advancing

means (3) serves to feed and advance said strip in a
stepwise manner, and a programmable drive (12) imparts

the advancing means (3) advancing movements of different
strokes, characterised in that the advancing means is in

the form of a reciprocating finger rod (3) to which different
forward and return strokes are imparted and which

comprises a plurality of fingers (4 - 8) which are staggered
in the direction of motion, the strip (2) being

advanced by different fingers (4 - 8) and strokes of the
finger rod (3) in order to first introduce the strip

into the forming tool (1) and to subsequently advance it
in a stepwise manner, the finger rod (3) being retracted

every time its foremost end enters into the area of the
forming tool.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that
an adaptation to different strips (2) and/or tools (1)

is obtained by a modification of the driving program.
Strip feeder for the purpose of feeding and advancing
a strip (2) into resp. through a forming tool (1), comprising

an advancing means (3) for the advance of the
strip and a programmable drive (M) for the former, characterised

in that the only advancing means serving to
feed and advance the strip in a stepwise manner is a

finger rod (3) having staggered fingers (4 - 8), and in
that the programmable drive is programmed in such a manner

that the finger rod (3) is driven with different
forward and return strokes. 
Strip feeder according to claim 3, characterised in
that the finger rod (3) is provided with fingers (4 - 8)

at different intervals.
Strip feeder according to claim 5, characterised in
that the intervals between the fingers are smaller at

the rear end of the finger rod (3) than at the front
end, with respect to the advancing direction, so that

the first stroke of the finger rod (3) is as short as
possible.
