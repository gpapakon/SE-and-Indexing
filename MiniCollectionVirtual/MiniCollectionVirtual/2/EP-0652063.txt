<ABSTRACT>
This device comprises a rigid chassis (12) having a vertical axis of symmetry (X) forming a virtual axis of oscillation of the chassis, defined by the intersection of the longitudinal and transverse vertical median planes of the chassis, this chassis being attached to a stationary support (14) by elastically deformable linking means (16). The knock-out device comprises, moreover, two devices (24) for gripping components to be knocked out, which are carried by two opposite ends of the chassis (12), being aligned in the median longitudinal plane, and two unbalance (unbalanced mass) motors (26) fixed on two opposite sides of the chassis (12), having axes of rotation parallel to the axis of symmetry (X) of the chassis (12) and aligned with this axis of symmetry in the transverse median plane, the motors (26) being intended, when operating, to make the chassis (12) oscillate about its virtual axis (X) so that the centre of gravity of each component to be knocked out describes a substantially horizontal and ellipsoid trajectory.

Device for decoring smelting cores of foundry
elements of the type including a rigid chassis (12) hooked

onto a fixed support (14), at least one device (24) for
gripping an element to be decored borne by the chassis

(12), and two imbalanced motors secured to said chassis
(12) and intended during operation to make the chassis

(12) oscillate, characterised in that the chassis (12) has
a vertical axis of symmetry (X) forming a virtual

oscillation axis of the chassis defined by the
intersection of longitudinal (L) and transversal (T)

vertical median planes of the chassis, this chassis (12)
being hooked onto the support (14) by elastically

deformable linking means (16), the decoring device
including two devices for gripping elements to be decored

borne by two opposing extremities of the chassis (12) by
being aligned inside the median longitudinal plane (L),

the two motors (26) being secured to two opposite sides of
the chassis (12) and having spin axes R â—‹ parallel to the

axis of symmetry (X) of the chassis (12) and aligned with
said axis of symmetry inside the median transversal plane

(T), the motors (26) thus being able to make the chassis
(12) oscillate around its virtual axis (X) so that the

centre of gravity of each element to be decored describes
an approximately ellipsoidal and horizontal trajectory
Device according to claim 1, characterised in
that the means connecting the chassis (12) to the support

(14) include four cylindrical joints (16) with vertical
axes able to deform elastically transversally and disposed

symmetrically two by two with respect to the longitudinal
(L) and transversal (T) vertical median planes.
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that each gripping device (24) includes a fixed jaw

(28) and a mobile jaw (34) delimiting opposing vertical
gripping faces between which an element to be decored can 

be maintained.
Device according to claim 3, characterised in
that the mobile jaw (34) is borne by at least one chamber

thrustor (32).
Device according to claim 3 or 4, characterised
in that the fixed jaws (28) and the mobile jaws (34)

respectively of the two gripping devices (24) are mounted
opposite each other with respect to the median

longitudinal vertical plane (L).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the median portion of the chassis

(12) to which the motors (26) are secured is narrower than
the extremity portions of the chassis (12) bearing the

gripping devices (24).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the chassis (12) is fitted with a

frame comprising horizontal plates (18) interconnected by
vertical longitudinal cores (20).
Device according to claims 3 and 7 taken
together, characterised in that each gripping device (24)

includes two vertical extremity plates (28, 30)
symmetrical with respect to the median longitudinal plane

(L) and secured to the opposing edges with rectangular
cuts (22) made in the corresponding extremities of the

horizontal plates of the frame, a first extremity plate
(28) forming the fixed jaw of the gripping device, the

second extremity plate (30) forming a support for a fixed
extremity of the thrustor (32), the gripping device (24)

further comprising a third plate (34) parallel to the
fixed jaw (28) borne by the mobile extremity of the

thrustor (32) forming the mobile jaw of the gripping
device (24).
Device according to one of claims 3 to 8,
characterised in that the fixed jaws (28) of the gripping

devices (24) include passage openings (38) for means (40)
for hammer-forging the elements kept in the gripping

devices.
