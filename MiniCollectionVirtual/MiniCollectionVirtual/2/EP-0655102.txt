<ABSTRACT>
In order to actuate simultaneously several reciprocating valves (5, 6) of an internal-combustion engine by means of a cam (18) and yet still use commercially available tappets (7, 8) and springs (20, 21), the invention proposes that a crossbar (14) be placed across the bottoms of the tappets (7, 8), the cam (18) acting directly, or via a rocker arm, on the crossbar between the axes of the valves (5, 6). The crossbar (14) is secured in place by a stud (16) which projects between the tappets (7, 8).

<CLAIMS>
Valve gear for at least two simultaneously operated 
lifting valves for changing the cylinder charge of an 

internal combustion engine in which each lifting valve (5, 
6) of the valve assembly to be operated simultaneously is 

assigned its own cup tappet (7, 8; 7', 8') and its own 
valve spring (20, 21) and on the tops of these cup tappets 

(7, 8; 7', 8') rests a common cross bar (14) which is 
prevented from sliding and of which the surface (17) facing 

away from the cup tappets (7, 8; 7', 8') is acted upon by 
a cam (18, 18') of a camshaft (19) between the valve axes, 

characterised in that the cross bar (14) with plane bearing 
surfaces (15) rests on the plane tops of the cup tappets 

(7, 8; 7', 8') and with a contour (16) projecting out of 
the plane of the bearing surfaces (15) engages between the 

outer circumferences of the cup tappets (7, 8; 7', 8'). 
Valve gear according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the cam (18, 18') acts directly on the cross bar (14). 
Valve gear according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the cam acts on the cross bar (14) with the interposition 

of a rocker.
