<ABSTRACT>
A process is provided for the vulcanization of 
ethylene-vinyl acetate polymers wherein an organic 

peroxide and zinc di-acrylate are added to the polymer 
and the mixture is heated to cause vulcanization to 

occur. Part of the ethylene-vinyl acetate polymer may 
be replaced with an ethylene-propylene-non-conjugated 

diene polymer. Such vulcanizates have an improved 
balance of properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
vulcanization of a mixture of ethylene-vinyl acetate polymer and ethylene-propylene-non-conjugated diene polymer using
an organic peroxide as vulcanization agent and zinc di-acrylate
as a reinforcing agent.Ethylene-vinyl acetate polymers are well known and
the vulcanization of such polymers with organic
peroxides is also well known. The use of zinc dimethacrylates
as a curable additive to improve the
properties of vulcanizates is taught in U.S. Patents
4 713 409, 4 857 571 and 4 983 678 but none of these
patents teach the use of zinc di-methacrylate with
ethylene-vinyl acetate polymers. Derwent patent
abstracts (1986) of published Japanese patent
applications J61 079 475A and J61 079 476A describe the
use of a polyfunctional acrylic ester (compounds having
acryloyloxy groups such as the reaction products of
ethylene glycol diacrylate with (meth)acrylic acid or
zinc dimethacrylate) as a crosslinking and blowing agent
in ethylene-vinyl acetate polymers.US-A-4 857 571 describes curable elastomer compositions
comprising elastomers such as EVA, EPDM and
mixtures thereof.The present invention is directed to a process for the vulcanization of
from 10 to 50 parts by weight of ethylene-propylene-non-conjugated diene
polymer combined with from 50 to 90 parts by weight of ethylene-vinyl
acetate polymer to provide 100 parts by weight of polymer wherein
100 parts by weight of said polymer is mixed with 0 to 60 parts by weight
of reinforcing filler, with from 0 to 15 parts by weight of zinc oxide, with from 1
to 10 parts by weight of organic peroxide and with from 5 to 35 parts by
weight of zinc di-acrylate, and the mixture is heated for from 10 to 60
minutes at from 150° to 180°C to produce the vulcanizate. Ethylene-vinyl acetate rubbery polymers are well
known. The ethylene-vinyl acetate polymers useful in
the present invention are those which contain from
35 to 85 weight percent of vinyl acetate,
preferably from 40 to 60 weight percent of
vinyl acetate, the balance being ethylene. Such
polymers have molecular weights, expressed as the Mooney
viscosity (ML 1+4 at 100°C), of 12 to 35,
have densities of about 1 g/cm3 and may have melt flow
indices at 190°C of 1 to 5 g per 10 min.
The rubbery polymer when compounded with carbon black
and vulcanized has good heat resistance, ozone
resistance and weathering capability.In the process of the present invention, the
rubbery polymer is mixed with the other components by
conventional means - that is on a rubber mill or in an
internal
