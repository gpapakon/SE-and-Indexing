<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel compounds and their use.The compounds of the invention have the formula:

in which each R1 to R4 group is hydrogen, C1-4 alkyl, C1-4
alkoxy, C1-4 alkoxyl-carbonyl, halo, hydroxy, nitro, cyano,
trihalomethyl or optionally substituted phenyl, each R5 to R16
group is hydrogen or C1-4 alkyl, each Z', Z'', Z''' and Z''''
group is an alkylene radical, and X and Y are each -(CH2)n- or
-(CH2)m-A-(CH2)p- where A is -CH=CH-, optionally substituted
phenylene or optionally substituted naphthalenyl, n is 2 to
10, and m and p are each 1 or 2; said optionally substituted
phenyl, phenylene and naphthalenyl being optionally
substituted with one or more substituents selected from halo,
trifluoromethyl, C1-4 alkoxy, hydroxy, nitro, C1-4 alkyl, C1-4
alkylthio and carboxy; and salts thereof.Compounds of the invention in which R5 to R16 are hydrogen are
indicated for use in the treatment of diseases of the central 
nervous system. Such compounds and those in which R5 to R16
take values other than hydrogen, are also of use as chelating
agents as for example with metal cations such as lead and
zinc, and transition metal cations, for example, lanthanum,
uranium, gold and especially copper, iron and cobalt.When reference is made to C1-4 alkyl in the above formula,
preferred groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl and
tert. butyl. Especially preferred groups are methyl and
ethyl. A C1-4 alkoxy group is one such alkyl group linked via
an oxygen atom. Preferred halo groups are fluoro, chloro and
bromo, and trifluoromethyl is the preferred example of
trihalomethyl.An R1 to R4 group is preferably hydrogen, C1-4 alkyl, C1-4
alkoxy, halo, hydroxy, nitro, cyano, trihalomethyl or
optionally substituted phenyl, and especially hydrogen, halo,
C1-4 alkyl or C1-4 alkoxy.An optionally substituted phenyl or naphthalenyl group is
preferably unsubstituted phenyl or naphthalenyl, and can also
be phenyl or naphthalenyl substituted with one or more
substituents, preferably one or two substituents selected
from halo, preferably fluoro, chloro or bromo,
trifluoromethyl, C1-4 alkoxy, hydroxy, nitro, C1-4 alkyl, C1-4
alkylthio and carboxy. An A radical is preferably of the
form:

where R17 is a substituent, for example one such listed above,
that is attached at any position on the phenylene or
naphthalenyl nucleus.The X and Y groups are preferably -(CH2)4-, -(CH2)6-, 
The radicals Z' to Z'''' in the above general formula are
alkylene groups which are each preferably of the formula
-CH2(CR'R'')sCH2- where R' and R''
