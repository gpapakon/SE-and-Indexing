<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an eight-structural polymer 
of 3-oxygermylpropionic acid represented by the following 
stereostructure: 
wherein R represents -CH₂CH₂COOH, and m is a weight average 
polymerization degree calculated on the basis of the weight 
average molecular weight of propagermanium propyl ester and 
is 137 ± 84 (137 on average with a standard deviation of 
± 3σ); and relates to a drug for preventing, ameliorating, 
and treating symptoms of immune diseases, in particular, 
hepatic disorders such as Type B hepatitis and Type C 
hepatitis, wart and AIDS caused by viruses, an interferon 
enhancer to be used in the interferon therapy, a Maillard 
reaction inhibitor, a drug for preventing and treating 
diabetes and concurrent diseases thereof caused by Maillard 
reaction, and an adjuvant for vaccines which comprises the 
above-mentioned compound as the major ingredient.  Since 3-oxygermylpropionic acid undergoes 
polymerization in a complicated manner and is useful for 
various applications, it has attracted attention of many 
researchers from the viewpoints of pharmacological activities 
in recent years. JP-B-57-53800 discloses antiviral 
activities etc. of this compound (The term "JP-B" as used 
herein means an "examined Japanese patent publication".). 
Further, it was reported that carboxyethylgermanium 
sesquioxide, which has been known for a long time and 
generally called Ge132, has a twelve-membered ring structure 
(J. Am. Chem. Soc., vol. 98(25), pp. 8287 (1976)). However, these compounds have some disadvantages. 
Namely, it is difficult to synthesize these compounds with 
good reproducibility and thus the pharmacological activities 
thereof vary from lot to lot. In addition, these compounds 
are poor in keeping qualities and thus suffer from a decrease 
in the activities during dispensing, etc. The present inventors have conducted extensive 
studies on preparation methods whereby the inherent 
pharmacological activities of 3-oxygermylpropionic acid can 
be sustained in a stable state. They have further studied 
the action mechanism of this compound after the incorporation 
in vivo. As a result, they have successfully found out 
various substances which serve as a stabilizer for 
3-oxygermylpropionic acid (JP-A-61-65819) and also found that  
 
sugars serve to enhance the pharmacological activities 
thereof (JP-A-60-190714) (The term "JP-A" as used herein 
means an "unexamined published Japanese patent 
application".). The structure of carboxyethylgermanium sesquioxide 
has already been
