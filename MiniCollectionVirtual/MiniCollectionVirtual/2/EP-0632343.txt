<ABSTRACT>
An electrophotographic apparatus, suitable for use in a 
printer, fax machine or photocopier for example, comprises a 

photoconductive drum 100 on which a toner image can be formed by 
means of a photo-exposing section 2 and a toner supply section 

3. 
A recording medium 110, such as paper, is passed over the 

drum 100 and held in contact with the drum by a transferring 
rotary body 4 to transfer the image to the gravity-oriented 

lower face of the recording medium. Downstream of the drum, the 
recording medium enters a fixer 5, where the image on the 

recording medium is fixed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrophotographic 
apparatus for use in electrophotographic printers, 
facsimile apparatuses or copying machines. In an electrophotographic apparatus, usually a 
toner image, after being formed on the surface of a 
photoconductive drum according to a latent electrostatic 
image, is transferred to recording paper or some other 
recording medium by a transfer charger. The transfer 
charger, known as a corotron, is often used for this 
transferring purpose. A corotron electrifier generates 
a strong electric field having a polarity reverse to 
that of the toner adhering to the photoconductive drum, 
and draws the toner on the photoconductive drum to the 
recording paper to accomplish transfer of the image. 
The peripheral speed of the photoconductive drum and the 
carriage speed of the recording paper are basically equal, 
and the paper, during the transferring process, should be 
pressed against the photoconductive drum with appropriate 
strength by the paper supply mechanism. However, since the corotron electrifier has no  
 
mechanism to press the recording paper to transferring 
part, if the impact which is generated when the tip of 
the paper rushes into the fixing section is transmitted 
to the corotron electrifier via the recording paper, the 
toner image is susceptible to disturbance during transfer. 
For this purpose, there should be provided a long enough 
distance between the transferring part of the corotron 
electrifier and the fixing section to prevent the impact 
generated on the tip of the recording paper from reaching 
the transferring part. This distance should be no less 
than 10 cm according to the prior art, necessitating 
a space in which to secure the distance and thereby 
preventing electrophotographic apparatuses from being 
reduced in size. On the other hand, some transfer chargers use a 
transferring rotary body (transcribing roller) which 
transfers the toner image to the recording paper while 
rotating in contact with the photoconductive drum. The 
transferring rotary body has its own capability to carry 
the recording paper to the fixer and accordingly the 
advantage of keeping the transferring part unaffected 
by the impact which arises when the tip of the recording 
paper rushes into the fixing section. This transferring 
rotary body is arranged underneath the photoconductive 
drum, and the recording paper onto which the toner image 
has been transferred is carried with its front face up  
 
and, after the image is fixed, stacked in a
