<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a programmable control apparatus of a heating installation of the type which comprises a clock (8) and a processing unit (2) provided for controlling one or more heating apparatuses of the said installation on the basis of programming data. The said programming data are either programming data read from the memory of a card (11), of the so-called microchip card type, when such a card (11) is inserted into a reader (10) of the apparatus, or programming data resident in the said processing unit (2) when no card is inserted into the said reader (10). The said resident programming data can be modified only if a card (11), a so-called key card, is inserted into the reader (10).

Programmable control apparatus of a heating
installation of the type comprising a clock (8) and a

processing unit (2) provided for controlling one or more
heating devices of the said installation according to

programming data, characterised in that the said
programming data used by the said processing unit are

either programming data read from the memory of a card
(11), of the so-called smart card type, when such a card

(11) is inserted in a reader (10) of the said apparatus, or
programming data resident in the said processing unit (2)

when no card is inserted in the said reader (10), the said
resident programming data being able to be modified only if

a card (11), called a key card, is inserted in the reader
(10).
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in
that it functions in a mode in which the programming data

contained in the memory of a card inserted in the reader
(10) are loaded into the processing unit (2) in order to

make them resident.
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that it functions in a mode in which the resident

programming data are transferred into the memory of the
card inserted in the reader (10).
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the memories of the cards which

contain programming data also contain data which identify
them as program cards. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the memories of the so called key

cards contain a code identifying them as key cards.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the memories of the co-called key

cards contain a code identifying the user.
