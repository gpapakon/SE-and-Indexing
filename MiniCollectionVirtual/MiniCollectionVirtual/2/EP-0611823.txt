<ABSTRACT>
A process for increasing the production rate of citric acid during 
the fermentation by the fungus Aspergillus, preferably 
Aspergillus 
niger,
 wherein the fungus is grown in presence of air, 
using a substrate with no trace metals, and with an increased 

initial sucrose concentration compared to conventional media, 
and subsequently to the initiation of acid excretion the fermentation 

broth is diluted instantly to 35 to 65%, preferably 40 to 
60%, most preferred to 50% of the initial sucrose concentration 

by means of water, while afterwards the fermentation and the 
isolation of the acid proceed in a conventional manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of biotechnology,
specifically to a new process for increasing the production rate
of citric acid. In detail the present invention is directed to
increasing the production rate of citric acid during fermentation
of a microorganism belonging to the genus Aspergillus,
preferably Aspergillus niger, by means of a new fermentative
mode, i.e. aerobic submerged fermentation.Sucrose present in the medium is converted into the acid by the
fungus Aspergillus niger during the biotechnological production
of citric acid. The yield of fermentation is about 80% while
only the rest of sucrose is used as energy source or transformed
to biomass. Citric acid as a product is relatively cheap in
comparison with other biotechnological products, however the
fermentation is taking place in huge, high volume, and energy
consuming fermenters. Therefore, by shortening the overall fermentation
time a significant reduction in price could be
achieved. It is obvious that changes in the metabolism of Aspergillus
niger must occur if increased rates of acid production
are desired.On industrial scale citric acid is usually produced by a batch
fermentation. Certain ecological conditions are prerequisite in
order to force fungal metabolism to excrete citric acid. It is
well known, that a high initial sucrose concentration (14-22%)
as well as a high dissolved oxygen tension is important. Since
it is difficult to dissolve enough oxygen in a solution containing
a high percentage of sucrose, due to the increased viscosity,
a compromise between both parameters must be accepted at
optimising the fermentation process. In such systems the rates
of acid accumulation usually do not exceed the value of 1 gram 
of acid formed per hour in a litre of substrate.At first we have studied the influence of ecological factors in
a high citric acid yielding medium on the metabolism of Aspergillus
niger.A high percentage of dissolved sucrose in the medium increases
the osmotic value in solution that presents a risk for the cells
to lose water. In order to survive, they must accumulate intracellularly
a low molecular weight substance that should be
very inert, and not disturbing the metabolism. Glycerol was
found to function as an osmoregulator in Aspergillus niger
cells in the early stage of growth (Legia M., Kidric J. (1989):
Initiation of citric acid accumulation in the early stages of
Aspergillus niger growth; Appl. Microbial. Biotechnol. 31,
453-457). Glycerol is formed from the intermediates of the pentose
phosphat
