<ABSTRACT>
A water-based prodn. of active pyrotechnic materials (I) contg. metal powder (II) comprises coating (II) with not more than 5 wt.% plastic (III) which is insoluble in dil. acid and water and largely impermeable to water and oxygen, making a slurry of the coated powder with water, mixing with the other components of (I) and introducing the slurry into the required mould. Also claimed is metal powder coated with not more than 5 wt.% plastic (III) as above. Pref. (II) is coated by a fluid-bed process, pref. a vacuum fluid-bed process. (II) is Al or Mg powder, and (III) is a (co)polymer based on (meth)acrylic acid and/or (meth)acrylate esters, esp. a methacrylic acid-methyl methacrylate (MA/MMA) copolymer, which is dissolved in a solvent.

Process for preparing water-based 
pyrotechnical active substances containing magnesium 

powder, characterised in that in a vacuum fluidised bed 
process, the magnesium powder is coated with a 

synthetic material which is insoluble in dilute acids 
and water and substantially impermeable to water and 

oxygen, with the coating being present in an amount of 
not more than 5% by weight with respect to the total 

amount of the magnesium powder, the resulting powder is 
suspended in water, mixed with the other components of 

the active substance and brought into the desired 
shape. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in 
that polymers or copolymers based on acrylic acid, 

methacrylic acid, acrylic acid esters and/or 
methacrylic acid esters are used as the synthetic 

material. 
Process according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the magnesium powder is 

coated with a methacrylic-acid-methyl-methacrylate 
copolymer, dissolved in a solvent. 
Process according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the magnesium powder is 

coated with the synthetic material in such an amount 
that a coating of 1 to 4 % by weight with respect to 

the total amount of the magnesium powder is achieved. 
Magnesium powder having a coating made of a 
synthetic material which is insoluble in dilute acids 

and water and substantially impermeable to water and 
oxygen, prepared by a process according to one of the 

claims 1 to 4. 
Magnesium powder according to claim 5, 
characterised in that the coating comprises a polymer 

or copolymer based on acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, 
acrylic acid esters and/or methacrylic acid esters.  

 
Use of a magnesium powder according to one of 
the claims 5 or 6, for preparing pyrotechnical active 

substances containing magnesium powder.
