<ABSTRACT>
A stator assembly for a progressive pump or motor, 
comprising a resilient material stator (10) having a helical 

bore (12) therethrough, the cylindrical outer surface (14) 
of the stator having a plurality of axially extending 

circumferentially spaced outward projections (16). A rigid 
generally tubular member (22) has cooperating recesses (24) 

and may be formed of a unitary tube or of a plurality of 
shell elements with a cooperating clamp arrangement (32-36). 

The side faces (18,20) of the projections are flat and 
either parallel to one another or are inclined towards one 

another in the radially outward direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to progressive 
cavity pump or motor apparatus and to a stator assembly 
therefore. One form of such apparatus comprises a stator 
having a bore with a female helical gear formation thereon 
of n starts, a rotor rotatable in said bore and having a 
cooperating male helical gear formation having n ± 1 starts, 
and depending on whether or not the apparatus is a pump or a 
motor, means are provided to rotate the rotor or to be 
rotated by the rotor relative to the stator. Traditionally 
the stator is formed of a resilient material, such as rubber 
or the like. Various designs of stator been proposed. In one 
the stator is supported only at one axial end by means of a 
radially outwardly extending flange. In a second design the 
resilient material stator is moulded into a sleeve referred 
to as a barrel and this requires a very considerable amount 
of pretreatment of the barrel before it is introduced into 
the mould. Basically, the cost of such a moulded-in stator 
is in the order of five times of that of a stator which is 
not moulded in. However, one of the advantages of a 
moulded-in stator is that it prevents or very significantly 
reduces any tendency for the stator to undergo torsionally 
deformation due to the operation of the rotor. Any 
torsionally deformation can significantly reduce the 
efficiency of the pump or motor. Various proposals have been made wherein the 
stator is radially compressed by one means or another to 
ensure a good sealing fit onto the rotor. EP-A-0083829, for example, discloses an 
arrangement in which the stator is provided with three 
radially outwardly extending axial ribs and a housing is 
formed of three essentially identical segments which are 
generally arcuate and each has a radially outwardly  
 
extending stub flange along one edge which cooperatingly 
engages with a cap flange on the opposite edge of an adjacent 
identical segment. This arrangement provides a truncated V-shaped 
groove within which the radially outwardly extending rib 
is engaged, the rib having a radial extent greater than the 
thickness of the flange. One or more screw operated band clamps 
surround the assembly to squeeze the housing elements against 
the outer surface of the stator. While this arrangement is generally satisfactory, it does 
produce the disadvantage that at the location of the ribs, the 
inner surface of the stator, that is the female helical gear 
formation therein, bulges inwardly which increases the local 
interference and can produce leak

A stator assembly for a progressive cavity pump or motor 
apparatus comprising a stator (10) having a bore (12) with a 

female helical gear formation thereon of n starts, a rotor (56) 
rotatable in said bore and having a cooperating male helical 

gear formation having n ± 1 starts, means (58-66) to rotate or 
be rotated by said rotor relative to said stator, said stator 

assembly comprising a stator (10) formed of a resilient 
material and having a substantially cylindrical outer surface 

(14) and an outer generally tubular rigid member (40) or rigid 
shell members (22) completely surrounding said stator, said 

stator (10) including a plurality of axially extending, equally 
circumferentially spaced radially outwardly extending 

projections (16) having circumferential sides (18,20) and said 
outer generally tubular rigid member (40) or rigid shell 

members (22) being separate from, completely surrounding and 
being removable from said stator, said rigid member (40) or 

rigid shell members (22) having a plurality of internal, 
axially extending, equally circumferentially spaced recesses 

(24, 42) formed therein, each recess having circumferential 
sides rigidly fixed with respect to one another and shaped to 

cooperate with and engage on each circumferential side of said 
projections (16) to prevent relative rotation therebetween 

about the axis of the stator, and thereby to prevent torsional 
instability of the stator, the projections and the recesses 

each being formed with a generally cylindrical outer face and 
each being provided with substantially flat side faces (18, 20) 

which are inclined towards one another in the radially outward  
 

direction or are substantially parallel to one another, the 
circumferential extent of the projections being of the same 

order of magnitude as the circumferential extent of the spaces

the circumferential extent of the projections (16) is less than 

3 times the circumferential extent of the spaces therebetween.

the circumferential extent of the spacing therebetween.

clamp (30-36) surrounding said shell members and enabling 

said shell members to be radially tightened against said 
stator. 
An assembly according to claim 5, characterised in 
that rebates (27,29) are formed in said side edges (26,28) 

whereby the rebate of a first side edge overlies the rebate 
of the second side edge of the adjacent shell member. 
An assembly according to claim 5 or 6, 
characterised in that the internal axially extending recess 

(24) of each shell member (22) extends generally 
circumferentially centrally of that shell member and in that 

the radially outwardly extending projections each

shell member. 
An assembly according to claim to 5, 6 or 7,

An assembly according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the outer generally tubular rigid
