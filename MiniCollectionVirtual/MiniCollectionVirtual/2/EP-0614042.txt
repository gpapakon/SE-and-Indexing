<ABSTRACT>
The segment (20) for a line illumination device which has a plurality of 
tubular fluorescent (2) and of single-ended compact fluorescent lamps (3) mounted 

alternatingly against a carrier (1), comprises a U-shaped profile (21) in which electrical 
components (24) for supplying power to the lamps are accommodated. The components 

are present in an open container (30) which can be coupled to the profile (21) in a 
watertight manner. The container (30) may be secured to a holder (40) destined for 

being mounted against a carrier (1) of the illumination device. The segment (20) allows 
for a fast and easy mounting of the device of any length and for easy replacement of 

components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a segment for a line illumination device of tubular 
fluorescent lamps which are to be mounted in line against a carrier and which each have 
end portions with respective lamp caps, alternating with single-ended compact 
fluorescent lamps whose lamp caps face towards the carrier,
 
   which segment is provided with a substantially U-shaped profile having a 
base and legs, in which profile supply components for the electric supply of fluorescent 
lamps are accommodated, and which segment is furthermore provided with means for 
fastening a mounting member fitted with lampholders for fluorescent lamps. 
The invention also relates to a line illumination device provided with such a segment. Such a line illumination device and a segment for it are known from EP 
0.510.963-A2. The known line illumination device renders it possible to illuminate the 
carrier evenly. In contrast to other line illumination devices, which are constructed 
exclusively with tubular fluorescent lamps, this device causes no interruptions in the 
illumination pattern which are the result of the comparatively dark end portions of the 
tubular lamps, and of the lamp caps and the lampholders in which these are held, from 
which no light at all issues. The compact fluorescent lamps with their comparatively 
high brightness compensate for the lack of light in these dark regions in other devices. When the device known from EP 0.514.963-A2 is arranged behind a 
translucent screen, this screen can also be evenly illuminated. For applications in the open air and for applications in humid spaces it is 
desirable that the supply components can be closed off from the surroundings in a 
watertight manner. It is also desirable that the device can nevertheless be installed with 
ease.  It is an object of the invention to provide a segment for a line illumination 
device of the kind described in the opening paragraph which offers the possibility of 
closing off the supply components from the surroundings in a watertight manner and 
which is nevertheless of a simple construction which renders possible an easy 
installation of a line illumination device with that segment. It is also an object of the 
invention to provide a line illumination device fitted with such a segment. According to the invention, this object is achieved in that an open 
container with supply components is present in the substantially U-shaped profile of the 
segment, which container can be coupled to the profile in a watertight manner. The segment may have

lamps (5) whose lamp caps (6) face towards the carrier (1), 

   which segment (20) is provided with a substantially U-shaped profile (21) 
having a base (22) and legs (23), in which profile supply components (24) for the 

electric supply of fluorescent lamps (2, 5) are accommodated, and which segment is 
furthermore provided with means (7) for fastening a mounting member (8) fitted with 

lampholders (9, 10) for fluorescent lamps (2, 5), 
   characterized in that an open container (30) with supply components (24) 

is present in the substantially U-shaped profile (21) of the segment (20), which 
container can be coupled to the profile (21) in a watertight manner. 
A segment as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the profile (21) 
has mutually facing open ducts (25) at the base (22), facing away from the legs (23). 
A segment as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the container 
(30) is fastened to a holder (40) designed for mounting against a carrier (1) of the line 

illumination device. 
A segment as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in that the holder (40) is 
substantially U-shaped with a base (41) and legs (42). 
A segment as claimed in Claim 4, characterized in that the holder (40) has 
rims at the legs (42) with hooks (44) which are directed inwards, which hooks provide a 

snap connection with first ridges (31) on the container (30). 
A segment as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the substantially 
U-shaped profile (21) has edges at the legs (23) with inwardly directed hooks (26) 

which provide a snap connection with second ridges (32) on the container (30). 
A segment as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the supply 
components (24) are present in the container (30) on a component carrier (50) which is 

fastened against a split shaft (36) at a wall (37) of the container (30).
