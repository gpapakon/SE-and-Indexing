<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns compounds which are effective anti-epileptica but have only a low sedative or teratogenic action and which have formulae (I), (II), (III) or (IV), the compounds of formulae (I) and (II) may also have multiple unsaturated bonds, R1, R2, R3 and R4, independently of each other, being hydrogen or a C1 to C6 alkyl group and R5 being hydrogen or a C1 to C2 alkyl group. In compounds of formulae (I) and (II), at least one of the groups R1 to R4 is different from hydrogen. The compounds of formula (I), when the carbon atom at the 2-position is at a centre of asymmetry, and the compounds of formulae (II), (III) and (IV) are in the form of their racemate, pure enantiomers or a mixture of their enantiomers different from the racemate. The invention also concerns pharmaceutically tolerated salts of these compounds.
