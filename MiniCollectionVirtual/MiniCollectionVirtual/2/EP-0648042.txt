<ABSTRACT>
A color space data conversion formula 
corresponding to the input and output conditions can be 

selected from basic profiles which consists of a plurality 
of the conversion formulas for color reproduction processes. 

A plurality of parameters or a plurality of variable 
conversion formulas can be selected from subprofiles, in 

accordance with the input and output conditions and on the 
ground of the color space data conversion formula selected 

from the basic profiles. Basic profiles or subprofiles can 
be added or modified. The color image data are processed 

highly accurately to obtain color images of high 
reproducibility, for therby facilitating the setting of the 

input and output conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color reproduction
system which has color space data conversion formulas,
their related formulas, parameters, etc. which are established
in a hierarchical structure, and which allows a desired
color space data conversion formula, etc. to be selected
under various given input and output conditions for
facilitating the reproduction of highly accurate colors.
Description of the Related Art:In recent years, there have widely been used color
reproduction systems for reading a color image from an
original document such as a photograph, a painting, or the like
or processing color image data supplied from an image input
device and either displaying a color image on a cathode-ray
tube (CRT), outputting a color image as a hard copy from a
printer, or printing a color image with a press plate. It
is desirable to be able to obtain a color image of desired
color tones irrespective of different output mediums and
processing steps.A printed material is produced according to a number
of processing steps. More specifically, color
separation films of Y, M, C, K are generated on the basis of
color image data supplied from an image input device, and
presensitized plates are exposed to color images through the 
color separation films. Then, the color images on the
presensitized plates are developed, and the presensitized
plates are set on a printing press to produce a printed
material. The colors on the printed material which are
finally produced depend on various printing conditions
including the paper, inks, and water used, the type of the
printing press, and the screen ruling and dot shape which
are employed for the formation of dot-matrix images. In the
field of printing industry which requires the above complex
processing steps and conditions, there has been a demand for
a system or process which displays color image data
processed as desired on a CRT or the like for the user to
confirm the final image quality of a printing material on
the CRT or the like with high accuracy.One prior art system which meets the above demand
is a color reproduction system disclosed in U.S. patent No.
US-A-4,500,919. The disclosed color reproduction system
comprises means for determining tristimulus appearance
signals as common color data from a colored original
document, means for effecting aesthetic correction on the
tristimulus appearance signals, means for displaying a
corrected color image based on the corrected tristimulus
appearance signals, and means for selecting color materials
for a hard copy
