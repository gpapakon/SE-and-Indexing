<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to high definition
television (HDTV) receivers and more particularly to television
receivers which are responsive to HDTV signals but are of lower
cost and are of quality commensurate with NTSC receivers.The system proposed and currently being evaluated for
the future HDTV system of the United States of America, are
primarily digital and provide relatively high resolution images.
Since the signals are digital and of relatively high resolution,
receivers designed to process such signals will require
significant amounts of state of the art hardware, including a
significant amount of video memory (VRAM). Until the technology
matures, which may take ten to fifteen years, this hardware
will render the HDTV receivers expensive, probably so much so
as to preclude purchase by middle class families of more than
one receiver per home. However most middle class families are
accustomed to having a plurality of receivers in their homes.
Thus there is a need for a lower cost HDTV receiver in the
nearer term.As the transmission of such high resolution signals
requires considerable bandwidth, encoding circuits have been
developed for reducing the data to be transmitted, as described
e.g. in US-A-5 049 993 and EP-A-0 366 919. Further from EP-A-0
460 928, a video signal converting apparatus is known which
is related to the MUSE system and comprises an interpolating
circuit for interpolating a non-sampling point from sampling
points in a field for restoring a high definition television
signal band-compressed by offset sub-sampling. In this way the
resolution and therewith the quality of the recovered and
decoded signal is being improved.The object of this invention is to provide a lower
cost receiver of HDTV signals still having advantages over NTSC
receivers. This object is achieved by the features included in
claim 1 or claim 14. Particular embodiments of the invention
are defined by the subclaims.The inventor of this application has realized that
while the costs for HDTV signal receivers can be lowered at
the sacrifice of some image resolution, such receivers do not
suffer from the common NTSC shortcomings such as crosscolor or
crossluma, and being digital will be compatible with other
digital apparatus such as home computers.A typical HDTV signal may represent images with 1050
lines and 1440 pixels per line. A typical HDTV receiver may
require, for example, four VRAMS for processing decoded signal
and further memory to buffer several fields of compressed data.
Considering eight bit samples,
