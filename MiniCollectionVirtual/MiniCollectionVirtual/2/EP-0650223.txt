<ABSTRACT>
Female electrical contact member including, at one end, crimping tabs (3 and 4) and, at the other end, a channel (2) having a rectangular cross-section, with a bottom (floor) wall (6) and a top (ceiling) wall (9), the bottom wall (6) being extended and bent over towards the inside of the channel (2) in order to form a springy strip (16) so that a male terminal blade (25), inserted into the channel (2), is pinched between the said strip (16) and the top wall (9), characterised in that a bar (24) is cut from the bottom wall (6), this bar (24) being bent over in order to extend under the springy strip (16) and to interact with the latter.

<CLAIMS>
A female electrical contact member of the type made from 
a strip of material which is a good conductor of 

electricity and endowed with a certain elasticity, cut 
and bent to have, at one end, lugs (3, 4) for crimping an 

electric wire and, at the other end, a duct (2) with a 
rectangular section having a bottom wall (6), two lateral 

walls (7 and 8) and a top wall (9), the bottom wall (6) 
being extended and bent towards the interior of the duct 

(2) to form an elastic strip (16) so that a male blade 
(25) introduced into the duct (2) is squeezed between the 

said strip (16) and the top wall (9), the bottom wall (6) 
comprising a cut bar (24) which is bent to extend beneath 

the elastic strip (16) and to cooperate with the latter, 

characterised in that
 the bar (24) is cut on the side of 
the lugs (3, 4) and is bent to extend towards the end of 

the duct (2) intended to receive the male blade (25), the 
lateral walls (7 and 8) comprising slashes (20, 21) which 

form, towards the inside, stops limiting the spring 
movement of the elastic strip, the bar (24) having a 

width less than the gap separating the slashes. 
A female electrical contact member according to Claim 1, 

characterised in that
 the elastic strip (16) is provided 
with lateral fins (18, 19) intended to bear against the 

slashes (20, 21).
