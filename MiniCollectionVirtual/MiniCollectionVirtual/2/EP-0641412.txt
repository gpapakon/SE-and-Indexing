<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a lock (1) opened by the insertion of a partially magnetized code card (8) and proposes, in order to produce a particularly user-friendly design, that a store (S) be fitted which is initiated in the lock-release position and which can be deactivated without neutralizing the lock-closure function and which, in use, stores, in such a way that the store can be interrogated, card code data in relation to other, absolute, data such as date and time of insertion of the card for a multiplicity of card insertions.

Lock (1) with locking function to be released by 
inserting a key card (8) which is magnetised in certain 

areas, in which the key card (8) entrains a slide (25) 
released by the magnetic pin tumblers (31), characterised 

by a memory (S) which is initiated in the release position 
of the slide (25) and which can be put out of operation 

without eliminating the locking function of the lock and 
which - in operation - stores codes of the key card in 

relation to other absolute data, e.g. date and time of the 
moment of key insertion and/or of the moment of key 

removal, for a plurality of key insertion processes so as 
to allow scanning. 
Lock according to claim 1 or in particular according 
thereto, characterised in that the stored codes are formed 

by a portion of the magnetic areas of the key card (8) not 
needed for locking. 
Lock according to one or more of the preceding claims or 
in particular according thereto, characterised in that the 

initiating magnetised areas (initiating areas I) move into 
their operative position only by displacement of the slide 

(25). 
Lock according to one or more of the preceding claims or 
in particular according thereto, characterised in that the 

memory can be removed from the lock while maintaining the 
locking function of the lock. 
Lock according to one or more of the preceding claims or 
in particular according thereto, characterised in that 

there is provided a switch which scans the slide (25) and 
which, in the displaced position of the slide (25), 

releases the memory (S) for initiation by the magnetised 
areas (initiating area I).  

 
Lock according to one or more of the preceding claims or 
in particular according thereto, characterised in that a 

further portion of the magnetised areas of the key card 
embodies a user code which the memory registers 

simultaneously with date and time so as to allow call-up. 
Lock according to one or more of the preceding claims or 
in particular according thereto, characterised in that the 

memory (S) is supplied by a battery arranged in the lock 
(1). 
Lock according to one or more of the preceding claims or 
in particular according thereto, characterised in that the 

activated memory also stores date/time of operation of the 
exterior handle (4) of the lock so as to allow call-up. 
Lock according to one or more of the preceding claims or 
in particular according thereto, characterised in that the 

initiating area passes under an induction coil as energy 
supplier. 
Lock according to one or more of the preceding claims 
or in particular according thereto, characterised in that 

the memory can be scanned only after removal from the lock.
