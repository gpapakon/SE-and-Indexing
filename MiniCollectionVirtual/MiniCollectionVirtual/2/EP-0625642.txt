<ABSTRACT>
A duct fan (1) comprises a fan housing (2) consisting of two 
components, an inlet component (3) and an outlet component (4), 

a motor bridge (5) placed within the housing, and a unit (6) 
consisting of a motor with impeller and attached to the motor 

bridge (5). The motor bridge (5), which is diametrically extended 
through the housing (2), is provided at its outer ends with lugs 

(16), which are received in impressions (9) in the edge portion 
(8) of the inlet component (3). The outlet component (4) is 

provided with an edge portion (12), which fits onto the edge 
portion (8) of the inlet component (3), and a shoulder (13) of 

the edge portion (12) of the outlet component (4) rests, in the 
assembled state, against the end edge of the edge portion (8) and 

against the motor bridge (5) at the lugs (16). The outlet 
component (4) is provided with impressions (14) in positions 

corresponding to the impressions (9) in the edge portion (8) of 
the inlet component (3) These impressions (14) form shoulders 

(15), which are on a level with the shoulder (13) of the edge 
portion (12) for abutment against the motor bridge (5) at the 

lugs (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to duct fans of the type having a 
radial impeller, and more specifically to a housing for such duct 
fans, which housing is easy to assemble and, which, merely 
through the assembly in itself-, firmly secures the motor bridge 
to the fan motor mounted thereon, as well as its radial impeller 
in its proper place within the housing. Duct fans are extensively used, e.g. in ventilation and air-conditioning 
systems in homes, offices and industrial plants, as 
well as in evacuation systems for toilets, shower rooms and other 
wet or damp spaces. In connection herewith, duct fans are easy 
to install in appropriate places within the various ducts, a fact 
contributing to the relatively extensive use of such fans. In 
connection herewith, the cost, however, is a limiting factor. It 
is thus desirable to produce these duct fans with a maximum efficiency 
in order to achieve a minimum cost without, however, 
having to lower the standards of quality or function. From GB-A-2 048 383 there is known a fan unit comprising a 
centrifugal impeller about the periphery of which is formed an 
annular manifold chamber. Therein are stationary blades so shaped 
as to direct the discharged airflow in an axial direction past 
the impeller. Due to the fact that the stationary blades are 
formed in a part of the housing and the motor has a mounting 
separate therefrom, the structure is rather complex and expensive. 
The unit is a typical structure from which the present 
invention aims to cheaper, more simple and more easy to assemble. From US-A-3 289 920 there is known an axial flow fan in which the 
electrical motor is fixed to the housing by supports, in a suitably 
way, most likely welded to the housing and clamped to the 
motor. The fixing is complicated and expensive as it requires 
special measures in order to be carried out.  
 A duct fan housing comprises two substantially funnel- or bell-shaped 
components, one of the components having an air inlet and 
the other one of the components having an air outlet. The inlet 
and the outlet are provided in the form of connecting sleeves 
adapted to connecting standard ventilating ducts. The two 
components are designed such that one of them fits onto the other 
across a distance at the wider ends of the components, and screws 
or rivets are inserted through the overlapping portions to keep 
the components together. Prior to the assembly, the motor and its 
accompanying fan generator are placed in one of the components 
and secured therein by means

<CLAIMS>
A duct fan (1) comprising a fan housing (2) assembled by an 
inlet component (3) and an outlet component (4), which are 

substantially funnel- or bell-shaped, and a motor bridge (5) 
placed within the housing (2) and having a unit consisting of a 

motor with radial impeller (6) secured thereon, 
characterized
 in 
that the motor bridge (5), which has a substantially rectangular 

shape and which is extended diametrically through the housing 
(2), is provided with lugs (16) at its short ends, in that an 

edge portion (8) of the inlet component (3) at the wider end 
thereof, which portion is intended for being received in an edge 

portion (12) of the outlet component (4) at the wider end 
thereof, is provided with impressions (9) for receiving the lugs 

(16) of the motor bridge (5), and in that the outlet component 
(4) is provided with impressions (14) in positions corresponding 

to the impressions (9) in the edge portion (8) of the inlet 
component (3), which impressions (14) form shoulders (15) for 

abutment against the motor bridge (5) at the lugs (16), which 
shoulders (15) are on a level with a shoulder (13) of the edge 

portion (12) of the outlet component (4), which shoulder rests 
against the end edge of the edge portion (8) when the inlet and 

outlet components (3,4) are assembled. 
The duct fan (1) according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that 
the edge portion (12) of the outlet component (4) is provided at 

its free edge with a portion (17) having a larger diameter than 
the rest of the edge portion (12).
