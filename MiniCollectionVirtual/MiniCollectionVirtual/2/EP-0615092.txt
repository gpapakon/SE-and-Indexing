<ABSTRACT>
Plug, comprising a bolt (3) on whose shaft the sealing means and mechanical anchoring means are threaded, the latter being expansible and capable of being applied against the internal surface of a pipe by tightening a nut (4) engaged on the screw thread of the bolt, which plug is characterised in that the sealing means (7, 8) comprise a rigid ring (11) receiving at least one elastically deformable annular sealing joint (121, 122, 123, 124), the length of the rigid ring being such that it determines, after tightening the closure plug using the nut, the maximum degree of axial compression of the sealing joint.

Blocking plug for ducts, in particular the
tubes of a heat exchanger, in which a fluid

circulates under pressure, this plug comprising a
bolt (3) on the shaft of which sealing means are

attached, and expandable mechanical anchoring
means which are capable of pressing against the

inside surface of a duct, by clamping a nut (4)
gripping on the threading of the bolt, in which

plug there are located the sealing means (7,8),
comprising at least one first rigid ring (11)

contiguous with a second rigid ring (13,14), this
first rigid ring (11) being provided with an outer

shoulder (11
1
) at one of its ends and with an inner
shoulder (11
2
) at its other end, these ends with
shoulders each receiving at least one resiliently

deformable annular sealing joint (12
1
, 12
2
, 12
3
,
12
4
), the length of the outer shoulder (11
1
) of the
first rigid ring being such that it defines, by

cooperation with the second rigid ring and after
clamping the blocking plug with the aid of the

nut, at least the maximum degree of axial
compression of the sealing joint (12
1
, 12
2
, 12
3
)
arranged on the outer shoulder (11
1
), which plug is
characterised in that the shoulders (11
1
 and 11
2
)
of the first rigid ring (11) have a length which 

is greater than the length of the associated joint
and less than twice the length thereof.
Plug according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the sealing means (7,8) comprise a first

rigid ring with a shoulder (11), accommodating the
sealing joints (12
1
, 12
2
, 12
3
, 12
4
) and two second
rings with shoulders (13, 14), of which the

shoulders (13
1
, 14
1
) form the complement to the
shoulders of this first ring.
Plug according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the expandable

mechanical anchoring means (6) comprising two
rigid rings (9) which are at the outside and at

least partially conical, between which there is
located a deformable one-piece ring.
Plug according to Claim 3, characterised
in that the deformable ring (10) is provided with

longitudinal slits at its two ends, these slit
ends of the ring coming to bear on the conical

ends (9
1
) of the two conical rings (9).
Plug according to Claim 4, characterised
in that the longitudinal slits or one of the ends

of the deformable ring (10) are offset from the
slots at their other end. 
Plug according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the bolt (3) is of a

length such that it receives, by threading, two
sealing means (7,8) and a mechanical anchoring

means (6).
