<ABSTRACT>
The honeycomb construction of the invention with an axis (1) along which a fluid can be passed through it and along which it is bounded by at least two opposite faces (2), has an inner structure  (5) formed by at least one metal sheet (3) through which an electric current can be conducted for heating purposes and on each face has a substantially metal frame (6) in which the inner structure is held. There is electrical insulation (7) between the inner structure and the frame. In this honeycomb construction components which ensure mechanical rigidity are separate from those which are directly electrically heatable and are designed to have the electrical resistance needed for heating. The honeycomb construction is simple to construct and extremely robust; it is particularly suitable for use as a substrate for a catalyst in the exhaust system of a motor vehicle.
