<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a speech efficient coding method applicable to, e.g., analysis by 
synthesis system such as MBE vocoder, and comprising the steps of: dividing an input 

speech signal in block units on the time base; dividing signals every respective divided 
blocks into signals in a plurality of frequency bands; discriminating whether signals 

every respective divided frequency bands are voiced sound (V) or unvoiced sound 
(UV); and reflecting each discrimination result of voiced sound/unvoiced sound of a 

frequency band on a lower frequency side in discrimination of voiced sound/unvoiced 
sound of a frequency band on a higher frequency side to obtain an ultimate 

discrimination result of voiced sound/unvoiced sound. Thus, even in the case where 
pitch suddenly changes, or harmonics structure is not precisely in correspondence with 

multiple of integer of the fundamental pitch period, stable judgement of V (Voiced 
Sound) can be made.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to such a speech efficient coding
method to divide an input speech signal in units of blocks to
carry out coding processing with divided blocks being as a unit.There have been known various coding methods adapted to
carry out signal compression by making use of the statistical
property in the time region and the frequency region of an audio
signal (including speech (voice) signal or acoustic signal) and
the characteristic from a viewpoint of hearing of the human
being. The coding method of this kind is further roughly
classified into coding in the time region, coding in the
frequency region, and analysis/synthesis coding, etc.As an example of efficient coding of speech signal, etc.,
there are MBE (Multiband Excitation) coding, SBE (Singleband
Excitation) coding, Harmonic coding, SBC (Sub-Band Coding), LPC
(Linear Predictive Coding), DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform), MDCT
(Modified DCT), or FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), etc. In such
efficient coding processing, in the case of quantizing various
information data such as spectrum amplitude or their parameters
(LSP parameter, α parameter, k parameter, etc.) there are many
cases where scalar quantization is conventionally carried out. In the speech (voice) analysis/synthesis system such as
PARCOR method, etc., since timing for switching excitation source
is given every block (frame) on the time base, voiced sound and
unvoiced sound cannot be mixed within the same frame. As a
result, high quality speech (voice) could not be obtained.On the contrary, in the above-mentioned MBE coding, since
voiced sound/unvoiced sound discriminations (V/UV discrimination)
are carried out on the basis of spectrum shape in bands every
respective bands (frequency bands) obtained by combining
respective harmonics of the frequency spectrum or 2 ∼ 3 harmonics
thereof, or every bands divided by fixed frequency band width
(e.g., 300 ∼ 400 Hz) with respect to speech signals (signal
components) within one block (frame), improvement in the sound
quality is concluded. Such V/UV discriminations every respective
bands are carried out chiefly in dependency upon the degree of
existence (occurrence) of harmonics in the spectra within those
bands.A speech efficient coding method in which V/UV discrimination based
on the spectrum structure on the lower frequency side is modified
is disclosed in D.W. Griffin and J.S. Lim, "A New Model-Based
Speech Analysis/Synthesis System", IEEE Acoustics Speech and Signal
Processing Society, Vol. 2, p. 513 - 516, March 1985. Meanwhile, if,
