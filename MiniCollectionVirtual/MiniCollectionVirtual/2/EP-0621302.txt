<ABSTRACT>
The invention is concerned with silicone copolymer 
containing terminal and/or pendant oxyalkylene styrene groups 

which are crosslinkable in the presence of a photoinitiator when 
exposed to UV radiation and their use in a compositions for

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to silicone co-polymers 
containing siloxane units which can be crosslinked using a 
photosensitive, cationic catalyst and the use of the 
silicone co-polymers in anti-adhesive coating compositions. It is known to employ compositions comprising 
silicone co-polymers as coatings to a variety of substrates 
in order to provide the substrate with, for example anti-adhesive 
or insulating properties. However, there is a 
continual need to provide improved silicone co-polymers 
which may be applied to a substrate and cured rapidly 
thereon by UV radiation to provide thin anti-adhesive 
coatings. We have now found that silicone copolymers having 
pendant and/or terminal oxyalkylene styrene groups attached 
to a silicon atom of a siloxane unit through a bridging 
group comprising an alkylene group which may contain oxygen 
or sulphur atoms, can be applied to a substrate as a film 
and rapidly cured thereon to provide a coating having good 
resistance to heat and anti-adhesive properties which does 
not adhere to even very strong adhesive materials. According to the invention there is provided a 
silicone copolymer having a molecular weight of 5,000 to 
100,000 having the general formula (I): 
Rb(Ra)₂SiO(V)v-(W)w-(Y)y-(Z)z-Si(Ra)₂Rbwherein V is a diorganosiloxane unit having monovalent 
hydrocarbon substituents having 1 to 8 carbon atoms; Ra is 
a group selected from methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, 
pentyl, hexyl, octyl and phenyl provided no more than one 
phenyl radical is bonded to any silicon atom; Rb is a group 
Ra or an oxyalkylene styrene group connected to a silicon  
 
atom of a siloxane unit through an alkylene chain which may 
have oxygen or sulphur atoms present in the chain; W is a 
siloxane unit having an oxyalkylene styrene group connected 
to the silicon atom of the siloxane unit through an 
alkylene chain which may contain oxygen or sulphur atoms in 
the chain; Y is a diorganosiloxy unit wherein the organo 
radicals are hydrocarbons having 1 to 12 carbon atoms or a 
fluorinated hydrocarbon group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms 
and Z represents a silfluoroalkylene-siloxy unit; v, y and 
z have identical or different values but they are not 
simultaneously zero; w is always non-zero and v+y+z/w is 
from 1 to 100. The V units in a silicone co-polymer according to the 
invention are preferably according to the general formula, 
- Si(Ra)₂O - wherein Ra is as defined above. The V siloxane units can be formed by methods well 
known in the art, for example from chlorosilanes. The
