<ABSTRACT>
The support for a first component (1) such as a steering column in relation to a second component (2) consists of two toothed racks which are attached to the two components and are engaged with one another in the locked position. A spring (9) separates the two racks when they are disengaged, while an additional spring (10) cooperates with a stirrup (12). The additional spring and stirrup are mounted on the locking system spindle, with the spring applying a force against the stirrup and urging it towards the movable rack (7) to ensure its full engagement with the fixed rack (8).

portion being disposed against the mobile rack (7),
flexible curved portions (82, 83, 84, 85) arranged
on respective opposite sides of said central portion

(81), the flexible curved portions (82, 83, 84, 85)
bearing on the fixed rack (8), and
two tongues (86, 87) extending toward the mobile
rack (7), so
 that said two tongues (86, 87) engage
respectively in notches (49, 50) defined in said mobile

rack (7) to couple the return spring (9) in rotation to
said mobile rack (7).
