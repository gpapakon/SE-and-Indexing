<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for inspecting the surface of a steel 
ball and other spherical object enables defects to be 

detected on the surface of a spherical object placed on 
a holder 2 by means of an inspection unit 1 comprising a 

proper number of electromagnetic sensors. The holder 2 
possesses a rotatable support 20 and an auxiliary 

support 23 for supporting the spherical object together 
with the support 20. The support 20 possesses a 

receiving groove 3 formed annularly along the rotating 
spherical peripheral surface, and this receiving groove 

3 can accommodate the bottom of the spherical object, 
and by the rotation of the support 20, the spherical 

object can be rolled within the receiving groove 3 so 
that the orientation of the spherical object can be 

changed, thereby automatically changing the inspection 
position of the spherical object. As a result, the 

surface inspection precision of steel balls or other 
spherical objects can be enhanced, and product 

qualification can be determined automatically and 

efficiently.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a surface inspection 
apparatus of spherical matter such as steel balls, other 
metal balls, ceramic balls, spherical stones, plastic 
balls and the like. Hitherto, for surface flaw detection or roundness 
inspection of spherical matter such as steel balls, 
generally, light was emitted to the surface of the 
spherical matter, and the reflected light was detected by 
a photo sensor. In such detection, there has been a demand for 
detection of plural positions on the surface of spherical 
matter to enhance the precision of inspection. To meet such demand, it has been possible to 
inspect plural positions by one inspection job by using 
multiple sensors and disposing sensors at different 
positions on the spherical matter. If, however, desired to inspect each position on 
the surface of the spherical matter in a wide range by 
using multiple sensors, sensors cannot be disposed in the 
bottom of the spherical matter, for example, because it is 
supported on a holder or a table, which gives rise to 
necessity of inspecting again by turning upside down 
after inspecting the upper hemisphere of the spherical 
matter. If such job is done manually each time, it is 
impossible to inspect a large quantity of spherical 
samples efficiently. It is hence a primary object of the 
invention to solve such problems. A surface inspection apparatus of spherical matter 
according to a first invention comprises an inspection 
unit 1 possessing electromagnetic sensors such as photo 
sensors, and a holder 2 for mounting steel balls or other 
spherical matter, and is constituted as follows.  The inspection unit 1 detects surface defects of 
spherical matter put on the holder 2 by a proper number 
of electromagnetic sensors. The holder 2 possesses a 
rotatable support 20 and an auxiliary support 23 for 
supporting the spherical matter together with the support 
20. The support 20 possesses a receiving groove 3 formed 
in an annular form along its rotating peripheral surface, 
and this receiving groove 3 can accommodate the vicinity 
of the bottom of the spherical matter, and the spherical 
matter is rolled within the receiving groove 3 by the 
rotation of the support 20, so that the direction of the 
spherical matter can be changed. The auxiliary support 
23 is formed separately from the support 20, and disposed 
near the support 20, and is designed to support the 
portion of the spherical matter exposed from the 
receiving groove 3, and holding the spherical matter at 
specific position. In a surface
