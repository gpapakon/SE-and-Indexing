<ABSTRACT>
A cation-sensitive electrode which comprises an internal reference electrode, an internal reference solution and a cation-responsive membrane, characterized in that the internal reference solution contains a saturated solution of a salt of a cation other than the cation for which the cation-responsive membrane is primarily selective, the internal reference solution being formed in situ by hydration of a combination of the salt of the cation with a hygroscopic material, by absorption of water from the atmosphere and/or by hydration of the hygroscopic material when the electrode is put into use, thereby forming the internal reference solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in 
cation-selective electrodes and, in particular, to a 
method of stabilising the internal or reference 
potential of a cation-selective electrode to reduce 
the disadvantage of a large temperature dependent 
voltage. Cation-selective electrodes are generally 
membrane-based devices, involving cation-responsive 
membrane materials which are selective for the 
passage of particular cations through the membrane. 
They may be used for the measurement of active 
species in liquids (see e.g. EP-A-0 385 452). Cation-selective electrodes are generally used in 
the potentiometric mode and the cation-responsive 
membrane establishes a voltage difference between the 
two solutions in contact with its surfaces, i.e. the 
test solution and the internal reference solution. 
The voltage difference is related to the difference 
in the logarithms of the concentration of the cation 
to which the membrane is selective in the two 
solutions. The cation-selective electrode is 
normally incorporated into an electrochemical cell 
with an internal standard reference electrode 
contacting the internal reference solution and a 
separate reference electrode contacting the analyte 
or test solution, usually via a salt bridge. In 
order for the voltage of the cell not to drift with 
time it is important that the concentration of the 
cations in the internal reference solution is kept 
stable. A convenient way of stabilising the cation 
concentration in the internal reference solution is 
to use a saturated solution with the cations in 
solution to contact with crystals of their salt. 
This method has the advantage that variations in the  
 
water content of the electrolyte do not affect the 
concentration of the cation. This method has the 
disadvantage that if the electrode is used for 
measuring low concentrations of the cation, a large 
voltage is generated across the cation-selective 
membrane. Furthermore, voltage is dependent upon the 
temperature of the cell and the temperature 
coefficient that results is inconvenient for many 
applications. The temperature compensation of the 
measurements made with cation-sensitive electrodes is 
becoming of increasing importance as more 
measurements are made outside the laboratory e.g. in 
environmental work and in potential biochemical 
applications. All of the ligands or ionophores which are used 
to make cation-selective electrodes show varying 
degrees of cross-sensitivity with cations other than 
the particular cation to which they
