<ABSTRACT>
Depletion layer depth and semiconductor real 
estate occupation area shortcomings of MOS capacitor architectures 

that are fanned on lightly doped semiconductor 
material are obviated by augmenting the MOS capacitor 

structure with a pair of opposite conductivity type, high 
impurity concentration regions (31,33), both of which are directly 

contiguous with the lightly doped lower plate layer (21,23,41) that 
underlies the capacitor's dielectric layer (15), and connecting 

both of these auxiliary heavily doped regions (31,33) to a common 
capacitor electrode terminal (39) for the lower plate of the 

capacitor. If a high negative charge is applied to the 
upper plate (17) overlying the thin dielectric layer (15), holes are 

readily supplied by the auxiliary P+ region. Conversely, 
if a high positive charge be applied to the upper plate (17), 

electrons are readily supplied by the auxiliary N+ region. 
By connecting both the auxiliary N+ and P+ regions together, 

a deep depletion condition is prevented for either 
polarity of the applied voltage. An application of the 

MOS capacitor structure is its use in a single event upset 
immune memory cell formed on an insulating substrata.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to
integrated circuit architectures and is particularly
directed to a novel MOS capacitor structure formed of a
lightly doped semiconductor layer and having a very fast
charging time for voltages of both positive and negative
polarities.There are a number of integrated circuit architectures
which require a capacitor having a very short
charging time (e.g. of the order of a nanosecond or less),
with a high magnitude bias voltage of either polarity.
Such a capacitor may have a surface (e.g. silicon-on-sapphire
(SOS)) structure, in which a surface insulator
(e.g. oxide layer) forms the capacitor dielectric between
a topside plate (e.g. doped polysilicon or metal) layer
and an underlying plate layer (e.g. a doped silicon
region).In many silicon-on-sapphire processes having a
(epitaxial) silicon layer formed atop a sapphire support
structure, it is possible to dope the epitaxial silicon
layer at a sufficiently high impurity concentration, such
that the depth of any depletion region formed in the
silicon layer underlying the surface dielectric (oxide) is
small relative to the thickness of the surface oxide. The
capacitance of the resulting MOS capacitor structure is 
near its maximum attainable value under all bias conditions
and the charging time is extremely small.Some manufacturing processes, however, do not readily
accommodate doping that portion of the semiconductor layer
underlying the thin oxide at a high impurity concentration,
so that the lower plate of an MOS capacitor must be formed
by way of a lightly doped region. In such a capacitor
structure, the lightly doped region will go into a deep
depletion condition in response to the application of a
high charge of a polarity corresponding to that of the
doped material (high negative charge for a lightly doped N
semiconductor layer and high positive charge for a lightly
doped P- semiconductor layer) . For such a lightly doped
structure, the depletion depth is typically an order of
magnitude greater than the oxide thickness, which significantly
reduces the transient capacitance.One possible solution to such a deep depletion recovery
problem would be to incorporate two such capacitors into
the circuit and connect the capacitors in parallel, one
capacitor having lightly doped N-material, contiguous with
a more heavily doped N+ contact region, and another capacitor
having lightly doped P- material, that is contiguous
with a more heavily doped P+ contact region. Such a circuit
configuration would ensure that the total
