<CLAIMS>
Catalyst which contains platinum and, as a support, 
carbon, for the catalytic oxid
ation of glyoxal to 
glyoxylic acid,
 
characterised in that the catalyst contains in 

addition molybdenum and/or cerium as modifiers, and 
that platinum is present in a quantity of from 0.1 to 

5.0 wt.%, preferably 0.5 to 3.5 wt.%, referred to the 
support, and the weight ratio of the platinum to the 

molybdenum and/or cerium simultaneously present is 
from 1 : 1 to 1 : 20, preferably 1 : 1 to 1 : 5 and 

that platinum and molybdenum and/or cerium are finely 
divided on the support. 
Catalyst according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the average particle diameter of 

the activated carbon is from 15 to 30 µm, the specific 
surface thereof is greater than 500 m
2
/g and the total 
pore volume thereof is greater than 0.5 ml/g. 
Process for the preparation of the catalyst according 
to claim 2 by precipitation of a platinum compound 

onto the support consisting of activated carbon, 
reduction, filtration and washing of the product,
 
characterised in that an aqueous suspension containing 

5 to 30 wt.% of activated carbon is prepared, that 
platinum and in addition molybdenum and/or cerium in 

the form of a solution of their water-soluble 
compounds are added to the suspension, the content of 

platinum and of molybdenum and/or cerium in this 
solution being calculated according to the required 

loading of the quantity of activated carbon used, that 
this mixture of suspension and solution is heated, 

with stirring, to 70 to 100°C, that platinum and 
molybdenum and/or cerium in the form of their 

sparingly soluble compounds are simultaneously 
deposited onto the activated carbon by addition of a base  

 
and that reduction is then carried out at unchanged 

temperature by addition of a reducing agent. 
Process for the preparation of glyoxylic acid by 
oxidation of glyoxalic acid in an aqueous medium with 

the supply of oxygen and with the use of a catalyst 
according to claim 1.
