<ABSTRACT>
A DS-CDMA system comprises at least one transmitter and at least one 
receiver operating on a dedicated signal channel which is used by other DS-CDMA 

operators in a non-synchronous way. A receiver for use in such a DS-CDMA 
system includes a data aided multiuser interference canceller (38) comprising a 

feedforward filter (48) connected to a subtracting stage (50). A decision stage (52) 
is connected to an output of the subtracting stage (50). Decisions from the decision 

stage (52) are stored in a memory which also stores preliminary decisions made on 
the signal applied to the feedforward filter (48) by a simple receiver (46). These 

decisions are applied to a feedback filter (58) the output of which is connected to 
the subtracting stage (50) thereby removing the effects of pre-cursive and post-cursive 

interference. The input to, and output from, the decision stage 52 are 
compared and the difference is used for adjusting the tap weights of the feedforward 

and feedback filters (48,58). In the case of a single input, single output, the 
feedforward filter (48) comprises a fractionally spaced equalizer which despreads 

and filters the DS-CDMA signal. In the case of multiple input, multiple output, the 
received signal is despread in a bank of code matched filters and the output is 

applied to the canceller (38) in which the feedforward filter (48) comprises a linear 
synchronous equalizer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a direct sequence code division multiple
access (DS-CDMA) communication system and to a receiver for use in such a
system.In a DS-CDMA communication system a digital signal, for example digitised
speech or data, is multiplied by a coding sequence comprising a pseudo-random
sequence which spreads the energy in the modulating signal, which energy is
transmitted as a spread spectrum signal. At the receiver, the antenna signal is
multiplied by the same pseudo-random sequence which is synchronised to the
spreading sequence in order to recover the modulating signal. Due to multipath
effects which will cause intersymbol interference, Rake combining is used to
overcome these effects and to produce a modulating signal which can be
demodulated satisfactory.In the case of a DS-CDMA communication system several different spread
spectrum signals having the same or different chip rates and transmitted
simultaneously at the same frequency by different users may be received at an
antenna, each signal having been subject to different multipath effects, a method of
equalisation which attempts to determine the channel impulse response and invert
it is not adequate. Amongst the problems is what is known as the near-far effect
due to signals from transmitters being received at a base station at different power
levels. This effect is overcome by the base stations having fast power control
algorithms.In order for a receiver to be able to adapt itself to different conditions which
may be found in practice, it must be able to cope with multiple bit rates which are
required by a multi-media service provision, variations in the loading of the system,
bit error degradation that other users' interference causes and power control failure
caused, for example, by near-far interference under severe fading conditions. It is an object of the present invention to recover a DS-CDMA signal
effectively.According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a
direct sequence-code division multiple access system having associated
therewith cross correlation values among contemporaneous users, the system
comprising a transmitter and a receiver, the transmitter having means for
multiplying a modulating signal with a spreading sequence in order to form a
spread spectrum signal and means for transmitting the spread spectrum signal
on a CDMA channel, and the receiver comprising receiving means for receiving
signals on said CDMA channel and interference cancelling means for cancelling
multiple access
