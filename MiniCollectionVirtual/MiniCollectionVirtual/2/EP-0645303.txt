<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of setting up a permanent reference configuration on a container (1), typically a case of large dimensions, such as a technical shelter, for the purpose of the precise positioning of external auxiliary elements (2) on this container, characterised in that it provides for:   - the precise relative positioning, on a flat table-type device, of rigid sectional interface elements (10) intended to be fixed onto the case in order to accommodate the external auxiliary elements on either side of the case, - the placing of the container (1) between the sectional elements held in the previously given precise position, - the pouring of a fixing product (11) between the container and the sectional elements (10), - the final fixing of the sections onto the container by mechanical anchoring means, after the fixing product has hardened.   The invention also relates to containers, especially of the air-portable technical shelter type, which are equipped according to this method.

A method of making a permanent reference facility on a large box-type
container (1), such as an operating cabin, for the purpose of

accurately positioning external auxiliary elements on the container,
said method being characterized in that it involves:


accurately positioning rigid shaped-section interface members
(10) relative to one another on a surface-plate type slab, which

members are designed to be fixed to the box to receive the external
auxiliary elements (2) on either side of the box, their positioning

on the surface-plate slab being chosen such that it guarantees that
the subsequent positioning of the auxiliary elements to be supported

complies with the relative-positioning standards laid down for the
auxiliary elements;
putting the container in place between the shaped-section
members held in the above-defined precise positions on the surface-plate

type slab;
pouring a fixing compound (11), such as a polymerizable resin,
between the container and each shaped-section member; and
fixing the shaped-section members permanently on the container
by mechanical fastening means, after the fixing compound has set.
A container (1) of the large box type such as an operating cabin,
in particular transportable by air, equipped with a permanent

reference facility for the purpose of accurately positioning external
auxiliary elements, in particular removable elements, on the

container, said container being characterized in that it is suitable
for being made by implementing the method defined in claim 1, and in

that it carries rigid shaped-section interface members (10) for
fixing to the auxiliary elements (2), which interface members are

secured to the container firstly by a layer of fixing compound (11)
poured between each of the shaped-section members and the container,

and secondly by mechanical fastening means.
A container (1) according to claim 2, characterized in that the
external auxiliary elements (2) are stowing solebars for an automatic

stowing system, which solebars are organized to be fixed in removable
manner on rigid shaped-section interface members (10) which are fixed 

permanently to opposite edges of the bottom of the box formed by the
container firstly by a layer of fixing compound poured between each

of the shaped-section members and the container, and secondly by
mechanical fastening means.
A container (1) according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that
the fixing compound (11) is of the polymerizable resin type that is

settable at ambient temperature, the means for fastening the shaped-section
members (10) to the container being of the rivet type.
