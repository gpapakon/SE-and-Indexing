<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to radiolabeled reagents that are scintigraphic imaging agents for imaging sites of thrombus formation in vivo, and methods for producing such reagents. Specifically, the invention relates to reagents each comprised of a specific binding compound, capable of binding to at least one component of a thrombus, covalently linked to a radiolabel-binding moiety. The invention provides these reagents, methods and kits for making such reagents, and methods for using such reagents labeled with technetium-99m to image thrombus sites in a mammalian body.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to radiodiagnostic reagents and methods for
producing labeled radiodiagnostic agents. Specifically, the invention relates to
reagents that can be labeled with technetium-99m (Tc-99m), methods and kits
for making and radiolabeling such reagents, and methods for using such
reagents to image sites of thrombus formation in a mammalian body.Thrombosis and thromboembolism, in particular deep vein thrombosis
(DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), are common clinical conditions that are
associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It has been estimated that
in the U.S. approximately 5 million patients experience one or more episodes
of DVT per year and that over 500,000 cases of PE occur, resulting in
100,000 deaths (J. Seabold, Society of Nuclear Medicine Annual Meeting
1990). It has also been estimated that over 90% of all pulmonary emboli arise
from DVT in the lower extremities. Fortunately, anticoagulant therapy can
effectively treat these conditions, if applied early enough. However, such
treatment is associated with risks (e.g. internal bleeding) that preclude
unnecessary prophylactic application. More advanced techniques of
thrombolytic intervention (such as the administration of recombinant tissue
plasminogen activator or streptokinase) can be used in acute cases, but these
techniques carry even greater risks. Moreover, effective clinical application of
these techniques requires that the site of the offending thrombus be identified
so as to monitor the effectiveness of treatment.For these reasons, a rapid means of localizing thrombi in vivo, most
preferably using non-invasive methods, is highly desirable. Methods currently
utilized for the identification of thrombolytic sites are contrast venography and
compression B-mode ultrasound; the choice of which technique is used depends 
on the expected location of the thrombus. However the former technique is
invasive, and both techniques are uncomfortable for the patient. In addition,
these methods are in many cases either unsuitable or yield inaccurate results.In the field of nuclear medicine, certain pathological conditions are
localized, or their extent is assessed, by detecting the distribution of small
quantities of internally-administered, radioactively-labeled tracer compounds
(called radiotracers or radiopharmaceuticals). Methods for detecting these
radiopharmaceuticals are known generally as imaging or radioimaging methods.In radioimaging, the radiolabel is a gamma-radiation emitting
radionuclide and the radiotracer is
