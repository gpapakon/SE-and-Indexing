<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel 2-piperazinone-1-acetic
acid compounds and their salts having an
inhibitory activity of adhesion of animal cells, and to
agents containing said compounds as the effective
component.The object of the present invention is to provide
therapeutic agents of various diseases by, in general,
controlling or inhibiting cell-adhesion.As the factors participating in adhesion to
extracellular substrate of animal cells, there have
been known fibronectin, vitronectin, osteopontin,
collagen, thrombospondin, fibrinogen and von Willebrand
factor. These proteins include -Arg-Gly-Asp- as cell
recognition site. This tripeptide is recognized by at
least one protein belonging to receptors, integrins,
which are heterodimeric proteins consisting of sub-units
combined to two membranes (E. Ruoslahti and M. D.
Pierschbacher, Science, 238, 491 (1987)).Structurally related integrins, which
recognize the amino acid sequence -Arg-Gly-Asp-, are
known to express at extracellular surface
of platelets, endothelial cells, leucocyte,
lymphocyte, monocyte and granulocyte. Compounds having
the amino acid sequence -Arg-Gly-Asp- are competitively
bound to the site to be bound by intercellular adhesive
molecule to thereby inhibit the binding of
intercellular adhesive molecules. As such substances
for inhibiting intercellular adhesion, there has been
known, for example, H-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro-OH.When blood vessels are injured, platelets are
activated with, for example, endothelial collagens,
which causes binding of fibrinogen to platelets, i.e.
platelet aggregation, to form thrombus. The
interaction between platelets and fibrinogen takes 
place through GP IIb/IIIa, this being an important
characteristic feature of platelet aggregation. Cell
adhesion-inhibiting substances can inhibit platelet
aggregation due to substances causing platelet
aggregation such as thrombin, epinephrine, ADP and
collagen.Besides, cell-adhesion inhibiting substances are
expected as drugs for suppression of metastasis of
tumor cells (inhibition of fixed adhesion at the site
where the tumor cells are migrated).Linear or cyclic peptides containing the amino
acid sequence, -Arg-Gly-Asp- (RGD) have been known as
cell-adhesion inhibiting substances, in, for example,
Journal of Biological Chemistry (J. Biol. Chem.), 262,
17294 (1987) and JPA H2(1990)-174797.These known peptide derivatives mentioned above
are not satisfactory in the potency of their activity,
and their oral absorbability is not satisfactory.
