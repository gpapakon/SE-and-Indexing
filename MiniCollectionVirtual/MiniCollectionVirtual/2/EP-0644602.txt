<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a plate pack for lead-acid batteries, the grid plates of which have thicker plate lugs in the case of one polarity than those of the other polarity, the volumes and areas of the two types of lug are evened up by tapering the thicker lugs in a wedge-shape towards the end (figure), the end thickness a2 of the said thicker lugs being less than the thickness of the thinner lugs which are left in their original state with a completely rectangular cross-section. Under this precondition, the heat balance of each of the two types of lug is the same during the fusing on of the bridging lead in identical casting moulds and at the same lead temperature. The thicker lugs obtain their wedge-shaped geometry by machining with an end milling cutter.

<CLAIMS>
A plate pack for lead accumulators comprising a number of 
positive and negative plates provided with plate lugs which 

are tapered to form a wedge shape, which plate pack is 
manufactured by encapsulating the lugs in a casting mould 

containing the bridge lead, characterized in that the plate 
lugs of the plates of the one polarity are thicker than the 

plate lugs of the other polarity, and in that the thicker 
plate lugs are tapered to form a wedge shape over an end 

section of their length, both the total cross-sectional 
surface areas and the volumes of the thicker plate lugs, 

which are tapered to form a wedge shape, and of the thinner 
lug diverters, which are left in their original state, 

being mutually identical. 
A plate pack according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the cross-sectional surface of the wedge-shaped lug section 

has a trapezium shape of which the shorter of the parallel 
but differently dimensioned sides forms the outer edge of 

the plate lug. 
A process for manufacturing a plate pack according to Claim 
1 and/or Claim 2, characterized in that the wedge-shaped 

tapering of the thicker plate lugs is produced by machining 
the lug surfaces on both sides using face cutters. 
A process for manufacturing a plate pack according to Claim 
3, characterized in that, from a pack of plates provided 

with thicker plate lugs, each plate is pushed out 
individually by a slide means and the lug surface is 

tapered to a point on both sides by means of a face cutter 
whilst the plate is fixed under the pressure of the plates 

respectively above it.
