<ABSTRACT>
In the fluidised-bed agglomeration process, the pulverulent solids (4) together with a granulation liquid (3) are sprayed into a fluidised bed (13) operated by fluidising air (2). The finished granules are discharged from the fluidised bed (13) through an air classifier (15). The granulation liquid (3) together with motive air is conducted through an axially directed three-component nozzle (12) arranged in the centre of the fluidised-bed granulator and, at the same time, the solids (4) are fed by means of a separately and concentrically supplied motive air stream through the annular gap of the three-component nozzle (12) into the fluidised bed (13). In this manner, a three-phase mixture of solids (4), granulation liquid (3) and motive air is produced in the centre of the fluidised bed (13).

Process for the continuous fluidized-bed agglomeration 
of a pulverulent solid (4) which is sprayed, 

together with a granulating liquid (3) into a fluidized 
bed (13) operated by fluidizing air (2) and in which the 

finished granules are discharged from the fluidized bed 
(13) through an air classifier (15), characterized in 

that the granulating liquid (3) is fed together with 
motive air centrally at the gas distributor plate (14) of 

the fluidized bed (13) through a three-component nozzle 
(12) and at the same time the solid (4) is fed into the 

fluidized bed (13) by means of a motive air stream fed 
separately and concentrically through the annular gap of 

the three-component nozzle (12), so that a three-phase 
mixture of solid (4), granulating liquid (3) and motive 

air is produced in the centre of the fluidized bed (13). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the finished granules are discharged from the 

fluidized bed (13) through an intake weir (25) arranged 
concentrically to the three-component nozzle (12) on the 

air classifier (15). 
Process according to Claim 1 to 2, characterized 
in that the solids content of the fluidized bed (13) is 

kept constant by a control loop in which 

a) the pressure drop of the fluidizing air in the 
fluidized bed (13) is used as a measured variable and 
b) the flow rate of the classifying air in the air 
classifier (15) is used as a manipulated variable. 
Process according to Claim 1 to 2, characterized 
in that the solids co
ntent of the fluidized bed is kept  
 

constant by a control loop in which 

a) the pressure drop of the fluidizing air in the 
fluidized bed is used as a measured variable and 
b) the inlet cross-sectional area of the intake weir (25) 
on the air classifier (15) is used as a manipulated 

variable. 
Process according to Claim 1 to 4, characterized 
in that some of the solid (4) to be granulated is added 

in finely divided form to the granulating liquid (3). 
Process according to Claim 1 to 5, characterized 
in that fine-grain portions in the fluidized bed (13) are 

separated off by an external dust filter (8) and 
recirculated into the fluidized bed (13) via the 

solids/motive air stream (5). 
Process according to Claim 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the product moisture in the fluidized bed (13) is 

measured and is controlled so as to be constant by 
adjusting the amount of granulating liquid or suspension 

metered into the fluidized bed. 
Apparatus for carrying out the process, 
consisting of a fluidized-bed granulator (1) having a gas 

distributor plate (14) and a nozzle for spraying the 
fluidized solid (4) with granulating liquid (3) and feeds 

for the solid (4) and the granulating liquid (3), and 
also of an air classifier (15) for the classifying 

discharge of the finished granules, characterized in that 
a three-component nozzle (12) is arranged axially in the 

centre of the fluidized-bed granulator (1) for spraying 
a three-phase mixture of solid, granulating liquid and 

motive air. 
Apparatus according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that an adjustable-height mixing tube 18 is mounted 

axially above the three-component nozzle (12). 
Apparatus according to Claim 8 to 9, 
characterized in that the inlet cross-sectional area of 

the intake weir (25) to the air classifier (15) by means 
of a louvre (27) consisting of a rotatable sector lamella 

disc (28).
