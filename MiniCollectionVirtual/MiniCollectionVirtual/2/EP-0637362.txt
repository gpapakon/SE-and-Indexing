<ABSTRACT>
The clutch mechanism comprises a cover (3), at least one pressure plate (2), a diaphragm (4) which bears on the cover (3), wherein assembly means (5) with primary bearing means (54, 61) and secondary bearing means (60) are provided for rockingly mounting the diaphragm. The secondary bearing means (60) is formed by using a ring made of elastic material which is crosslinkable and adherent after deposition.

A clutch mechanism in particular for motor vehicles, of 
the type comprising an annular cover (3) suitable for 

being fixed to a reaction plate (100), at least one 
annular pressure plate (2), rotationally connected to the 

cover (3) by being mounted axially movably in relation 
thereto, an annular diaphragm (4), which, bearing on the 

cover (3), acts axially on the pressure plate (2) in a 
direction for which the said plate (2) moves away from 

the cover (3) for contact with the friction linings (107) 
of a driven plate assembly (102), in which the diaphragm 

(4) has a peripheral part forming a Belleville washer 
(41) and a central part divided into radial levers (42), 

the said peripheral part (41) being rockingly mounted on 
the cover (3) by means of mounting means (5) rockingly 

fixing the diaphragm (4) to the cover (3) and comprising 
retention elements (51) connected to the cover (3) and 

primary (54, 61) and secondary (60) annular bearing means 
disposed on either side of the diaphragm (4) with the 

primary bearing means adjacent to the cover (3), whereas 
the radial levers (42) are suitable for being operated by 

thrust by a clutch throwout device (105),
characterised in that
 the secondary bearing means (60) is 
formed by means of a ring made of elastic material which 

is cross-linkable and adherent after its deposition. 
A mechanism according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the secondary bearing means (60) 
has an oblong shape. 
A mechanism according to Claim 2,
characterised in that
 the secondary bearing means (60) is 
stuck to the diaphragm (4).  

 
A mechanism according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the secondary bearing means (60) is 
stuck to a support ring (70, 74). 
A mechanism according to Claim 4,
characterised in that
 the support ring (70, 74) has a 
seat (71, 76) forming a mould for the secondary bearing 

means (60). 
A mechanism according to Claim 5, in which the retention 
elements consist of relatively thin and flat retention 

lugs here of the cover by having an axial part (51) 
passing through the diaphragm (4),
characterised in that
 the said support ring (70, 74) is 
centred at its inner periphery on the axial lugs (51). 
A mechanism according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the primary bearing means (61) is 
in the image of the secondary bearing means (60).
