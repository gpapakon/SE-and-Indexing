<ABSTRACT>
The optical transmitter (3) is used for transmitting a light beam A which exhibits a periodic auxiliary-carrier signal which is phase-angled or frequency modulated by an information signal (NS). The transmitter (3) comprises at least one laser (11), a beam splitter (12), a beam coupler (16), a light modulator (14), an optical fibre (18) and optical links for connecting these units. To this are added advantageously two polarisation monitors (21, 23) and a control loop of a further beam splitter (25), a photodiode (27), a control circuit (28), an actuator (29) and the optical fibre (18). The first light beam (L1) output by the laser (11) is divided by the beam splitter (12). One part-beam (L2) enters the optical fibre (18) and generates in the latter a returning light beam (L4) of slightly different frequency due to stimulated Brillouin scattering. The other part-beam (L3) passes through the modulator (14) and is phase modulated in the latter. The last-mentioned beams (L3, L4) are combined in the coupler (16) and result in the beam A. The control loop acts on the length of the optical fibre (18) by means of the piezoelectric effect and prevents a spontaneous change between the various possible cavity modes of the fibre (18).
