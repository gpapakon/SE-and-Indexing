<ABSTRACT>
The waste incinerator presented here is an installation in which two receptacles (1) and (2) - provided with covers (5), in their upper openings, and blades (3) which draw the waste, in their lower extremities - deposit the respective content into a combustion chamber (4) by the action of the to-and-fro movement of the said blades. In its turn, this combustion chamber has eccentric blades (9), to which a rotational movement is imparted, which push the outfall which is burnt portion by portion in this chamber until it falls into trucks (10) which pass through the chamber (4) transversely, and remove the remaining residues, later classified. The combustion gases pass inside an apparatus (11) which is also contained in this installation and which performs heat exchange, that is to say that it cools the abovementioned gases (profiting from their heat for other purposes) before they enter into a series of tanks (13) which allow these gases to be filtered before they are rejected via the flue (chimney) (23).

Waste incinerator which causes the destruction of 
residues of different types, including tyres, comprising two 

silos (1, 2), placed above a combustion chamber (4), one for 
the deposit of the tyres and the other for the deposit of 

the waste in general, silos which have, in the opening or 
upper part, a cover (5) which closes hermetically and, in 

the bottom, which is inclined, a set of tubes for the 
discharge of the liquids, and a blade (3) which, by its 

cadenced movement, causes the feeding of the combustion 
chamber and makes the distribution of the content of said 

silos according to the transversal direction of the 
combustion chamber, blade which has a movement of velocity 

adjustable in connection with the combustion operated at the 
interior of the combustion chamber. 
Waste incinerator according to the previous claim, 
wherein there is a slanted bottom (8), maid of refractory 

material, bottom which is higher on the outlet side of the 
combustion chamber than on its inlet side, and, in that 

bottom (8), a series of intercalar eccentric plates (9), 
which turn out of phase in relation to each other and which 

pull and lift up the materials that are deposited in the 
furnace, materials that the said plates (9) move all along 

the chamber (4). 
Waste incinerator according to the previous claims, 
wherein there is a boiler (11) for recovering the heat from 

the combustion gases, placed at the outlet of the combustion 
chamber (4). 
Waste incinerator according to the previous claims, 
wherein there are two vibrating perforated screens (24), 

inclined and placed at each of the sides of the incinerator. 
Waste incinerator according to the previous claims, 
wherein the vibrating screens (24) have perforations therein 

that are larger the closer said perforations are to the 
lower extreme of the screens. 
Waste incinerator according to the previous claims, 
wherein there is a group of extractors (12) which, by means 

of the appropriate conduits, make the extraction to the 
interior of the containers (13), which have a filtering 

liquid for filtering the gases that result from the 
combustion.  

 
Waste incinerator according to the previous claims, 
wherein the filtering of the gases is done in the first 

containers (13) in which the gases pass through said 
filtering liquid. 
Waste incinerator according to the previous claims, 
wherein the containers (13) are interconnected by conduits 

which make possible the circulation of the filtering liquid 
between the containers (13). 
Waste incinerator according to the previous claims, 
wherein there are filtering liquid injectors which 

wash and cool the extractors (12) and dissipate the creams 
eventually existing in the surface of the liquid of the 

containers. 
Waste incinerator according to the previous claims, 
wherein there is the last container (17) which has a spiral 

conveyor (19) which collects the lampblack, a pump (22) 
which, simultaneously, restores the level of filtering 

liquid in the first container and feeds the injectors (14), 
and an outlet for the chimney (23) of the already cooled and 

impurity free gases.
