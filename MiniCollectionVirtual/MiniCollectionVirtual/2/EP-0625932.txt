<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a ball lock assembly
according to the preamble of claim 1.U.S. Patent No. 4,270,422 to Andersson shows
a cutting tool with a clamping feature. In the
structure shown by this patent, one rotates a bar to
cause it to pull back and expand projections on the
cutting head which facilitates the connection of the
cutting head to the holder body.U.S. Patent No. 4,655,655 to Schürfeld shows
a tool and workpiece holding arrangement where a
tension rod of a replaceable secondary holder, which
holds the cutting insert, is received within the bore
of a clamping tube. By pulling the clamping tube,
rollers engage the tension rod and slots in the
clamping tube so as to retain the secondary holder to
the primary holder. The device shown by this patent
uses a canister to retain the clamping rollers.U.S. Patent No. 4,708,040 to Erickson, which
is assigned to Kennametal Inc. as is the instant
application
and discloses a ball lock assembly according to the preamble of
claim 1, is hereby incorporated by reference and
shows a structure for locking a toolholder to a support 
member. The support member carries a lock rod which
when pulled, causes locking elements to roll out of
depressions and onto a groove which causes the locking
elements to move radially outwardly to thereby lock the
toolholder to the support member. In the structure
shown in this patent, the lock rod does not carry the
locking elements.U.S. Patent No. 4,747,735 to Erickson et al
which is assigned to Kennametal Inc., as is the instant
application, is hereby incorporated by reference and
shows a structure for locking a toolholder to a support
member. In addition, Erickson et al teaches in Figures
1, 2, 3 and 5, two types of toolholder designs. As
will be shown, these toolholders may be compatible with
the ball lock assembly disclosed and claimed in the
present application.U.S. Patent No. 4,981,057 to von Haas et al.
shows a clamping device for connecting the tool head to
a tool holder of a machine tool. The patent shows a
structure with a shaft which upon rotation causes balls
to move radially outwardly into engagement to lock the
members together. Bores in the stem of the holder
accommodate the balls.It is a principal object of the invention to
provide an improved ball lock apparatus for securing a
cutting head to a locking component.It is another object of the invention to
provide an improved ball lock apparatus that uses a
lock rod and locking balls without a canister.It is still another object of the invention
to provide an

<CLAIMS>
A ball lock assembly (20) for releasably
engaging a cutting head (22) having a locking component

(24) including a housing (48,50) containing a central
longitudinal bore (52), a lock rod (94) within said bore

(52), said lock rod (94) carrying at least one locking
member (105); moving means, operatively connected to the

lock rod (94), for moving the lock rod (94) between a
locked position wherein the locking member (105) engages

the cutting head (22) to hold the cutting head (22) to
the locking component (48,50) and an unlocked position

wherein the locking member (105) does not engage the
cutting head (22) so that the cu
tting head (22) is not
held to the locking component (48,50), said lock rod (94)

having opposite ends (96,98), and said lock rod (94)
carrying at one end (96) thereof said at least one

locking member (105), characterized by

said lock rod (94) containing a channel (116)
adjacent the other end (98) thereof, said channel (116)

having a helical portion; and

   wherein said moving means includes a sleeve
(150) surrounding the portion of the lock rod (94)

containing said channel (116), a lock nut (170) being
operative connected to said sleeve (150) so that upon the

rotation of said lock nut (170) the sleeve (150) moves in
an axial fashion, and said sleeve (150) containing a

radially inwardly projecting pin (78) which engages the
channel (116) so that upon the axial movement of the

sleeve (150) the lock rod (94) rotates.
The ball lock assembly (20) of claim 1
further including a first biasing means (124) for biasing

the lock rod (94) into the locked position.
The ball lock assembly (20) of claim 2
further including a second biasing means (136) for

biasing the lock rod (94) into the unlocked position.
The ball lock assembly (20) of claim 1
wherein the sleeve (150) contains a channel (164)

therein, and the housing (48,50) contains a pin (78)
projecting radially inwardly into the bore (52) so as to

register with the channel (164) and therby secure the
sleeve (150) against rotational motion.
The ball lock assembly (20) of claim 1
wherein said cutting head (22) has a shank (31)

comprising a pair of oppositely disposed tapered prongs
(32,34) containing oppositely disposed recesses (38,40)

and wherein said lock rod (94) contains a pair of
opposite pockets (102,104) at the one end (96) thereof,

and a pair of locking members (105) with one locking
member (105) in each of the prong recesses (38,40).
The ball lock assembly (20) of claim 5
wherein each of said locking members (105) is a ball.
The ball lock assembly (20) of claim 1
wherein said cutting head (22) has a shank (31)

comprising a pair of oppositely disposed tapered prongs
(32,34) and wherein a transverse channel (36) separates

the prongs (32,34) and wherein a pair of oppositely
disposed locator pins (55) extends radially inwardly into

the mouth of the bore (52) so as to register with and
position the cutting head (22) within the mouth of the

bore (52).
