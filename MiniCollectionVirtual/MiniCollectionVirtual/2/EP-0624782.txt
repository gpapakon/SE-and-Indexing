<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for sealing and monitoring a body, in particular a refuse dump (1). In so doing, a first seal (2) has allocated to it at least one channel (3) which is permeable to a material to be detected. Allocated to the channel (3) are a pump (8) and a sensor (9). Provision is made for a first, liquid-tight seal (2) to be present. The at least one channel (3) is allocated to the latter. A second seal (4) made of sealing mineral material is arranged covering the first seal (2) and the at least one channel (3), the permeability of the said second seal (4) perpendicular to the sealing surface being lower than in the plane of the sealing surface. The second seal (4) can have a material capable of swelling.

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for the double-sided sealing and
monitoring of a body, in particular a refuse dump (1),

having a first liquid-tight seal (2) and a second seal
(4) of a mineral, sealing material, and having a

monitoring arrangement having at least one channel (3)
which is permeable for a substance to be detected and

has an inlet opening (3A) and an outlet opening (3B)
for a transport medium and the outlet opening (3B) of

which is connected to a sensor (9) for the substance to
be detected, characterised in that both in the lower

region and in the upper region of the body, the double-sided
seal is constructed in such a way that the at

least one channel (3) is embedded in the second seal
(4) or arranged between the first seal (2) and the

second seal (4), and in that the second seal (4) has a
lower permeability at right angles to the sealing

surface than in the plane of the sealing surface, in
order to guide the substance to be detected to the

channel (3).
Arrangement according to claim 1,

characterised in that it is arranged substantially
horizontally.
Arrangement according to one of the claims 1
or 2, characterised in that in the lower region of the

body, the first seal (2α) is arranged facing the body,
in that the at least one channel (3α) is arranged on

the side of the first seal (2α) that faces away from
the body, and in that the second seal (4α) is arranged

on the side of the first seal (2α) and of the at least
one channel (3α) that faces away from the body.
Arrangement according to one of the claims 1
or 2, characterised in that in the upper region of the

body, the at least one channel (3β) is arranged on the
side of the first seal (2β) that faces the body, and in

that the second seal (4β) is arranged on the side of 
the first seal (2β) and of the at least one channel

(3β) that faces the body.
Arrangement according to one of the claims 1
or 3 or 4, characterised in that it is arranged

substantially vertically at the side of the body.
Arrangement according to one of the claims 1
to 5, characterised in that the first seal (2) consists

of individual segments (2a-c) which are connected to
each other.
Arrangement according to one of the claims 5
or 6, characterised in that the channel (3) is fastened

to the first seal (2) with holding loops (14).
Arrangement according to one of the claims 1
to 7, characterised in that the second seal (4) is

three-layered, and in that the middle layer (12)
consists of an absorbent material and the two other

layers (11, 13) consist of an inert mineral material.
Arrangement according to one of the claims 1
to 8, characterised in that the second seal (4) has a

material which is capable of swelling.
Arrangement according to one of the claims 1
to 9, characterised in that at least one fibre mat

(4a - 4c) which is capable of swelling is arranged as a
second seal (4).
Arrangement according to claim 10,

characterised in that at least one channel (3) is fixed
on each fibre mat (4a - 4c) in a manner such that it

faces the first seal (2).
Arrangement according to one of the claims 1
to 11, characterised in that the second seal (4) is

arranged so as to be inclined towards an adjacent
channel (3).
Arrangement according to one of the claims 1
to 12, characterised in that the second seal (4)

consists of bentonite or contains bentonite.
Arrangement according to one of the claims 1
 
to 13, characterised in that arranged between the two

seals (2 and 4) is a permeable intermediate layer (5)
which is allocated to the at least one channel (3).
Arrangement according to claim 14,

characterised in that the permeable intermediate layer
(5) consists of sand.
Arrangement according to one of the claims 1
to 15, characterised in that channels (3a-c) are

arranged at different distances from the first seal
(2).
Arrangement according to one of the claims 1
to 16, characterised in that in order to recognise a

leak in the first seal (2), there is a lance (17), with
which a tracer is to be brought into the vicinity of

the first seal (2).
