<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a vacuum cleaner nozzle (10; 10') adapted to contact a working surface, said vacuun cleaner nozzle including a brush nozzle (12; 12') having edge portions (16b, 16c; 16'b, 16'c) provided along the longitudinal sides of the brush nozzle (12; 12'). The invention also relates to a method to perform edge cleaning along the front edge portion, seen in the direction of motion, of the brush nozzle (12; 12'). Known vacuum cleaner nozzles have the disadvantage that when the brush nozzle is active dust and solid particles are transported around on the working surface that is vacuumed, i.e. dust and solid particles will not enter inside the brush rim. Further, known brush nozzles do not have edge cleaning along the front edge, seen in the direction of motion. Significant for the present invention is that the longitudinal edge portions (16b, 16c; 16'b, 16'c) are given a synchronized elevating/lowering movement whereby a front edge portion (16b; 16'b), seen in the direction of motion, is elevated from the working surface while simultaneously a rear edge portion (16c; 16'c), seen in the direction of motion, is lowered against the working surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Vacuum cleaner nozzleThe present invention relates to a vacuum cleaner nozzle adapted to contact a working surface, said vacuum cleaner nozzle including a brush nozzle having edge portions provided in the area of the longitudinal sides of the brush nozzle.In known vacuum cleaner nozzles of the type mentioned above the brush nozzle is normally provided with a circumferential brush rim. In operative position of the brush nozzle the brush rim contacts the working surface along its entire circumference. However, the brush rim might have certain interrupted portions to promote so called edge cleaning or facilitate for particles or the like to enter inside the brush rim. A tube shaft is normally connected to the vacuum cleaner nozzle via a tube connection that is pivotable relative to the vacuum cleaner nozzle to allow the tube shaft to be angled, within certain limits, relative to the vacuum cleaner nozzle and thus not affecting the contact of the brush rim against the working surface. This means that during normal handling of the tube shaft in connection with vacuum cleaning and the brush rim being in active position, the entire circumference of the brush rim will contact the working surface. It is realized that as a consequence of this contact along the entire circumference the brush rim will to a great extent only shove around particles that are present on the working surface, i.e. said particles will not enter inside the brush rim due to the contact of the rim against the working surface along its entire circumference. Certainly the above-mentioned interrupted portions of the brush rim in certain areas might bring about that particles to a small extent will enter inside the brush rim. However, this will not at all occur to a sufficient degree. So called edge cleaning along the longitudinal front edge of the brush nozzle is as well not possible in connection with known vacuum cleaner nozzles of the type described above. The aim of the present invention is to present a vacuum cleaner nozzle of the above- mentioned type where it is guaranteed that particles to be 

sucked enter inside the brush rim when the brush nozzle is in active position. A vacuum cleaner nozzle according to the present invention also makes so called edge cleaning possible.The aim of the present invention is realized by a vacuum cleaner nozzle that has been given the characteristics of the appending claims. Below an embodiment of the invention will be described, reference being made to the accompanying drawings, where Fig. la discloses
