<ABSTRACT>
For the deacidification of an aqueous condensate (1) containing ammonia and at least one of the acid gases H2S and CO2, the acid gases are first driven off in a deacidification column (7) at a pressure of from 2 to 30 bar. An NH3-rich gas and steam mixture (15) having a temperature in the range from 110 to 200 DEG C is drawn off from the middle region of the deacidification column, the mixture is cooled and in the process forms an ammonia-rich condensate (21). This ammonia-rich condensate is fed into an NH3 purification column (22) which is heated in the lower region. The gases and vapours which rise into the upper region of the NH3 purification column are brought into direct contact with aqueous ammonia, so that NH3 (27) largely free of acid gases can be drawn off at the top of the purification column. From the bottom of the NH3 purification column there is drawn off a solution (28) having a temperature in the range of 50 to 100 DEG C, which is fed to the deacidification column.

A method for deacidifying an aqueous condensate
which contains ammonia and at least one of the acid

gases H
2
S and CO
2
, in which acid gases are expelled from
the condensate in a deacidification column heated in

the lower region at a pressure of 2 to 30 bar using
water vapour and in the upper region of the

deacidification column rising gases and vapours are
brought into direct contact with washing water, largely

ammonia-free acid gas having an NH
3
 content of at most
1.0% by volume, calculated free of H
2
O, is branched off
at the top of the deacidification column, and an NH
3
-rich
gas and vapour mixture is removed from the middle

region of the deacidification column through a side
outlet beneath the inlet for the condensate,

characterised in that the NH
3
-rich gas and vapour
mixture is withdrawn through the side outlet at a

temperature in the range from 110 to 200°C, the gas and
vapour mixture is cooled until at least 90% by volume

of the mixture condenses, with ammonia-rich condensate
and a residual gas stream being formed, that the

ammonia-rich condensate is fed to an NH
3
 purification
column which is heated in the lower region and in which

there is a pressure in the range from 1 to 10 bar, that
in the upper region of the NH
3
 purification column
rising gases and vapours are brought into direct

contact with aqueous ammonia and at the top of the
purification column NH
3
 is branched off largely free of
acid gases, that a solution having a temperature in the

range from 50 to 100°C is removed from the sump of the
NH
3
 purification column and is passed into the
deacidification column, and that the residual gas

stream is passed into the deacidification column. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the gas and vapour mixture removed from the

deacidification column is cooled by direct contact with
circulated ammonia-rich condensate and the residual gas

stream is branched off.
A method according to Claim 2, characterised in
that the gas and vapour mixture removed from the

deacidification column is first used for indirectly
heating the lower region of the NH
3
 purification column
and the gas and vapour mixture is then further cooled

by direct contact with circulated ammonia-rich
condensate.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that spent washing water is removed from the upper

region of the deacidification column and the organic
compounds contained therein are removed in a separator.
