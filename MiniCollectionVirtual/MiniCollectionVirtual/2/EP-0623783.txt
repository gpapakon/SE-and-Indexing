<ABSTRACT>
This invention is about a new process to obtain 
combustion, through the newest way of use of an existing element in our 

nature. We refer to OZONE, to improve the combustion chemical reations 
on any kind of material, reducuing the contaminating elements achiving 

the optimal process, reducing the combustion materials volume. 
Up to the present, the general idea of combustion 
in a mathematical model is as follows:

 
   COMBUSTIBLE + OXIGEN + HEAT

 
   It is changed the mathematical model of combustion

 
   COMBUSTIBLE + OZONE + HEAT

 
   Synthesis is a new combustion process for use of 

ozone as a comburent(as a supporter of combustion); the ozone appication 
for the emulsion of combustibles and the ozone for the violent oxidation 

of chemical reactions on combustion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is about a new process to obtain combustion, 
through the newest way of use of an existig element in our nature. 
We refer to Ozone, to improve the combustion chemical reations on any 
kind of material, reducing the contaminanting elements achiving the optimal 
process, reducing the combustion materials volume. Energy is produced by humanbeing through combustion. 
This is an ancient metter and whith a fundamental importance for the technology 
and it is still a metter of investigation up to this date. Combustion 
is still a matter of research for technicians on this subject. Regardless 
all the devises conceived, they have not arrived to born every combustible 
and that left not completely burned is discharged to our atmosphere, 
producing part of our contamination. Whith the available processes 
to obtain combustion, toxic substances or materials are generated. The results on present combustion are the defiances 
of researchers to diminish or eventually erradicate contamination produced 
as a result of combustion. On the other hand, combustibles are too 
expensive and dificult to obtain and we alredy know we have a high percentage 
of waste during the combustion process. We can asure that our present world is in crisis:  
 
Energy crisis, crisis combustion and the crisis caused by resultant 
efects on our atmosphere, it is contamination.
 
Up to the present, the general idea of combustion in a mathematical 
model is as follows:
 
   COMBUSTIBLE + OXIGEN + HEAT
 
Combustion is widely known in our industry, through combustible material: 
Solid, Liquified or Gassed in the presence of Oxigen and Heat.
 
Example:
 
   CARBON in electric plant to generate steam.
 
   OIL as a source of energy for motored vehicles.
 
   GAS for turbines, motors and burners.
 
I believe it is not necessary to say more about combustion and its 
industrial aplication and on the present basic principles mentioned 
before; so it is my desire to make reference to the invention I want 
to have patented, pointing out its Industrial character, Novelty and 
Inventive step (non-obvius subject metter). In first place, it is changed the mathematical model 
of combustion:
 
   COMBUSTIBLE + OZONE + HEAT
 
   The above mentioned formula is considered the newest 
process in the production of industrial result, that is Combustion, as 
one of esencial elements in is changed in order to be produced, regarding 
the new appliction of an already existing element in nature, wich 
has never been used before not even imagined by
