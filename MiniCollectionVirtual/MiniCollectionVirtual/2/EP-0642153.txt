<ABSTRACT>
(Object)
The objects of the invention, in the case of a dielectric 
barrier discharge lamp, are first to obtain a good space 

uniformity of the light output, a good time stability of the 
light output as well as a high light yield, second to achieve a 

high light coefficient of utilization and at the same time a 
simple maintenance of the lamp and third not to contaminate a 

given atmosphere by air or the like. 
(Arrangement)
In a dielectric barrier discharge lamp, in which a discharge 
vessel, in which a discharge gas forming "excimer" molecules is 

encapsulated, is provided with a dielectric provided with a 
netlike electrode and a window, through which the light goes, the 

first object of the invention is achieved by an arrangement in 
which a thickness of ends of the above-described netlike 

electrodes is greater than the average thickness of the entire 
electrode. The second object of the invention is achieved by an 

arrangement in which a holder incorporated in the discharge 
vessel has an outer dimension that is less than/equal to an outer  

 
dimension of the netlike electrodes. The third object of the 

invention is achieved by an arrangement by which the discharge 
vessel has a hollow cylindrical shape formed from an external 

tube and an internal tube and a means for hermetic sealing is 
arranged inside the internal tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a so-called dielectric barrier 
discharge lamp, which is used, for example, as an ultraviolet 
light source for a photochemical reaction, and in which light 
radiated from "excimer" molecules, which are formed by a 
dielectric barrier discharge, is used. As generic art, a radiator, i.e., a dielectric barrier 
discharge lamp, is known, for example, from EP-A-324 953 (JP laid-open 
specification HEI 2-7353) or U.S. Patent US-A-9 837 484, in which a 
discharge vessel is filled with a discharge gas forming "excimer" 
molecules and in which "excimer" molecules are formed by a 
dielectric barrier discharge, which is also designated as ozone 
production discharge or as silent discharge, as is described in  
 
"Discharge Handbook," Electrogesellschaft [Electric Company], 
June 1989, 7th Edition, page 263. In the radiator, light is 
radiated from the "excimer" molecules. In the above-named publications, an arrangement of a 
dielectric barrier discharge lamp is described, in which the 
discharge vessel has a cylindrical shape and functions at least 
partially also as dielectric of the above-described dielectric 
barrier discharge, which is at least partially transparent 
relative to the light radiated from the above-described "excimer" 
molecules. In this discharge lamp, further, the above-described 
light-transmitting dielectric is provided at least partially with 
netlike electrodes. Further, another design of a dielectric barrier discharge 
lamp is known, which has an approximately cylindrical outer shape 
as well as an overall hollow cylindrical discharge vessel, in 
which an external tube and an internal tube are arranged 
coaxially to one another, a discharge space exists between the 
external tube and the internal tube and a hollow space is formed 
inside the internal tube. The above-described dielectric barrier discharge lamps have 
various advantages, which neither conventional low-pressure 
mercury discharge lamps nor conventional high-pressure arc 
discharge lamps have, such as, for example, a radiation of 
ultraviolet rays with short waves, in which main wavelengths lie 
at 172 nm, 222 nm and 308 nm, and at the same time a selective  
 
production of light with individual wavelengths with a high 
efficiency, which are, for example, line-spectrum-like. However, a conventional dielectric barrier discharge lamp 
had the drawback that a space uniformity of light output, a time 
stability and a light yield were not always obtained to a 
sufficient degree. Further, it was regarded
