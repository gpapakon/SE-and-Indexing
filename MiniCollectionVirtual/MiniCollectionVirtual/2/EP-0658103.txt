<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a novel composition of antifungal agents which 
have low solubility in aqueous media, a process for preparing said composition and 
pharmaceutical dosage forms for oral administration comprising said novel composition. The development of efficaceous pharmaceutical compositions of azole antifungals such 
as for example, itraconazole and saperconazole, is hampered considerably by the fact 
that said antifungals are only very sparingly soluble in water. The solubility and 
bioavailability of said compounds can be increased by complexation with cyclodextrins 
or derivatives thereof as described in WO 85/02767 and US-4, 764, 604. Yet, there still 
exists an important demand for formulations of antifungal agents with good 
bioavailability for oral administration. Itraconazole or (±)-cis-4-[4-[4-[4-[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]methoxy]phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]phenyl]-2,4-dihydro-2-(1-methylpropyl)-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one, is a broadspectrum antifungal compound 
developed for oral, parenteral and topical use and is disclosed in US-4,267,179. Its 
difluoro analog, saperconazole or (±)-cis-4-[4-[4-[4-[[2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]methoxy]phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]-phenyl]-2,4-dihydro-2-(1-methoxypropyl)-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one, has improved activity against 
Aspergillus spp. and is disclosed in US-4,916,134. Document WO 89/05634 discloses a sustained-release solid medicament form and a method for the preparation thereof. Unexpectedly, it has now been found that the incorporation of poorly soluble antifungal 
agents in hydrophilic polymers and applying this mixture as a coat film over many small 
beads, yields a composition with good bioavailability which can conveniently be 
manufactured and which is suitable for preparing pharmaceutical dosage forms for oral 
administration. In particular the present invention is concerned with beads which comprise (a) a central, 
rounded or spherical core, (b) a coating film of a hydrophilic polymer and an antifungal  
 
agent and (c) a seal-coating polymer layer, characterized in that the core has a diameter 
of about 600 to about 700 µm (25-30 mesh). Beads obtainable from 600-700 µm (25-30 mesh) cores comprise approximately, by weight based on 
the total weight of the bead : (a) 20 to 60 percent core material; (b) 25 to 50 percent 
hydrophilic polymer; (c) 10 to 25 percent antifungal agent; and (d) 2 to 5 percent seal 
coating polymer. The particular sin
