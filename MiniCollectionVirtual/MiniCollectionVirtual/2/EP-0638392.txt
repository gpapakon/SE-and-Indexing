<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to coated abrasives and to
their preparation.Coated abrasive products are normally prepared by
coating one surface of a substrate with a first binder
layer having adhesive properties, often referred to in
the art as the "make" coating. Particles of abrasive
material are applied to the coated substrate and
partially embedded therein. A layer of a second
binder, often referred to as the "size" coating, is
then applied over the abrasive particles and make
coating. The thickness of the second binder layer
regulates the amount of the abrasive material extending
above the binder medium. Anti-loading materials have
generally been included in a further optional layer,
referred to in the art as the "supersize" coating.The adhesives used to form the make coating are
generally water- or solvent-based and include phenolic
resins, urea-formaldehyde, melamine-formaldehyde and
combinations thereof. Other adhesives which have been
used are based on animal hide glue and starch. Similar
adhesives have been used for the size coating.Many of the known adhesive systems which have been
used in the above constructions are of low solids
content requiring a high energy input for drying and
the careful selection of backing materials. In the
case of solvent-based adhesives, apparatus to extract
solvent emissions can also be needed. Such extraction
apparatus may also extract the fines from the abrasive
particles leading to processing problems. According to the present invention, coated
abrasives are presented comprising a substrate bearing
a layer of a moisture-cured hot melt polyurethane
adhesive having abrasive particles at least partially
embedded therein. The present invention also
provides a process, according to claim 18,
for preparing such coated abrasives.
