<ABSTRACT>
A method of processing a non-planar substrate, 
suitable for filling vias (12) and contact holes, spreads a 

suspension of a conductive material suspended in a liquid on a 
substrate. The suspension includes an organometallic 

material, preferably with particles of a polymerized tin or 
indium alkoxide. The material is spread by spinning the 

substrate after applying the suspension. The carrier liquid 
and organic groups are removed by baking and curing at 

elevated temperatures, thereby depositing the conductive 
material on the substrate in a layer which is more planar than 

the substrate and which has regions of greater and lesser 
thickness. A relatively brief etch step removes conductive 

material from regions of lesser thickness, leaving conductive 
material filling vias or contact holes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to semiconductor processing 
and, in particular, to processes which include planarization 
in producing conductive levels. Typical manufacturing processes form active devices on a 
silicon substrate and then interconnect devices using several 
conductive levels. Insulating layers separate conductive 
levels, and contact holes (vias) allow interconnection from 
one conductive level to another. Methods of forming conductive levels often rely on 
deposition or photolithographic techniques which suffer when 
the device surface is uneven. For example, a non-planar wafer 
surface may prevent a single level from being patterned with a 
wide range of focus, thereby reducing photolithographic 
process uniformity and repeatability. One known technique for the processing of devices that 
utilize multi-level metal interconnections involves the 
deposition of a refractory metal such as tungsten, W, followed 
by an etchback process to form tungsten "plugs" in contact or 
via holes. Although this method has been successfully implemented, 
it has certain drawbacks that are inherent in the use of a 
refractory metal. First, a thick deposition of tungsten is 
required--typically 1.0 to 1.2 times the diameter of the via 
or contact hole--and a long etch is required to remove the 
majority of the tungsten from the surface of the wafer. 
Second, when the tungsten is removed from the surface, the 
barrier material is exposed at the sides of the hole. If the 
etch rate for tungsten is less than the etch rate for the 
barrier material, then the barrier material along the side of 
the via hole will be removed and leave a void. The third 
disadvantage arises from the fact that tungsten is deposited 
by grain growth, and the final tungsten film is composed of 
individual merged grains. Gaseous tungsten may be unable to 
diffuse to the bottom of a via before it closes over at the 
top and forms a seam between the merging wall of tungsten 
grains.  Other techniques, such as aluminum reflow, have been used 
to achieve the desired planarization, but these methods also 
have certain drawbacks. First, aluminum reflow cannot be used 
if the lower interconnect layer uses aluminum, because reflow 
requires heating the wafer above the aluminum melting point 
(> 500Â°C). Second, the aluminum reflow process is difficult to 
control and requires very uniform heating and cooling across 
the wafer within a narrow temperature window. Third, the 
dielectric film onto which the aluminum is deposited has to be 
dehydrate
