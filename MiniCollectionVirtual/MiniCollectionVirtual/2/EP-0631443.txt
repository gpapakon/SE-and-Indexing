Device for the transmission of images collected
by a satellite comprising means (17) for sending binary

data to a receiving station (18) on the earth and processing
means (13, 14) to which at least one imager of

the satellite transmits rows of blocks which are binary
values representative of the pixels of an integer number

of consecutive swath rows of the exposure-taking instrument,
these processing means (13, 14) receiving these

data at a fixed binary data bit rate and outputting
binary data to the sending means (17) with a fixed bit

rate which is lower than the bit rate at the input of
the processing means, these processing means (13, 14)

comprising a compression unit which comprises:

a decorrelation module (3);
a quantizer (4) which receives decorrelated
data from the decorrelation module (3) and which

quantizes them as a function of a parameter for
adjusting the degree of compression;
a coding module (5) which receives quantized
data from the quantizer and which codes these data,

according to a variable-length code;

   the processing means also comprising:

a FIFO type memory (2) receiving coded data from
the coding module, the said memory being linked at

output to the sending means;
regulating means (6) which receive from the FIFO
memory (2) an item of information regarding the

degree of fill thereof and which determine, as a
function of this degree of fill, a degree of 

compression adjustment parameter (F), for the
quantitizer;

characterized in that the said processing means also
comprise means (8) of pre-analysis of the images transmitted

to the compression unit (1), these pre-analysis
means (8) comprising means for determining, for a row of

blocks to be processed, an estimator parameter for
estimating the quantity of information contained in this

row of blocks, this estimator parameter being
transmitted to the regulating means,

the said regulating means (6) comprising memory means
(6a) in which are stored:


on the one hand, a return-to-equilibrium law by
which they determine, as a function of the degree

of fill of the FIFO memory (2), a post-compression
desired number of bits for the processed row of

blocks, and
on the other hand, data making it possible to associate
a parameter for adjusting the optimal degree

of compression with a pair of estimator parameter
values and of a post-compression desired number of

bits,

the regulating means (6) determining from these data and
as a function, on the one hand, of a post-compression

desired number of bits determined with the aid of the
return-to-equilibrium law and, on the other hand, of the

estimator parameter, an optimal degree of compression
adjustment parameter (F),

this desired number of bits being corrected beforehand
by a bias which is a mean value of the differences

between the desired number of bits determined for
previously processed rows of blocks and the actual

number of bits occupied in the FIFO memory (2) after
these rows of blocks have been processed.
Device for the transmission of images according
to Claim 1, characterized in that the data stored in the

regulating means (6) comprise a net (6a) of linear
relations between the estimator parameter and the estimated 

number of bits produced after compression, for a
given degree of compression adjustment parameter.
Device for the transmission of images according
to one of Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the

image portion processed is the row of blocks and in that
the bias B(M) for the row of blocks (M) is given by:


where V is an adjustment parameter,
where m is an integer dependent on the embodiment and
Δ (M-i) is the difference, for the row of blocks (M-i),
between the actual number of bits and the desired number

of bits when processing this row.
Transmission device according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the return-to-equilibrium

law stored by the regulating means aims at a
theoretical return to a degree of fill of 50% of the

FIFO memory (2) after K rows of blocks have been
processed, where K is a predetermined integer.
Device for the transmission of images according
to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that it

comprises a buffer memory (10) in which is stored the
row of blocks of which the pre-analysis means have

determined the estimator parameter, before this row of
blocks is processed by the compression unit (1), during

the determination by the regulating means (6) of the
corresponding degree of compression adjustment factor to

be applied to the compression unit (1).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the estimator parameter determined

by the pre-analysis means (8) is the entropy of the
differences between adjacent pixels of the image portion

to be processed.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the estimator parameter determined

by the pre-analysis means (8) is: 


where P

 is the value of the pixel with coordinates
(i,j) of the image portion to be processed.
