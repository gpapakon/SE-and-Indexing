<ABSTRACT>
An electric hand saw, in particular a hand-guided sabre saw (10), is proposed at which the sawdust accumulating during the sawing is to be removed in the area of the tool. For this purpose, a suction duct (17) is fastened to the underside of the machine. The intake opening (20) of the suction duct (17) extends from the front end face of the suction duct (17) up to below a longitudinal slot (21) at the front on the underside of the machine, the longitudinal slot (21) running under the end section of the double saw blade (12).

<CLAIMS>
Hand-held, electrically driven sabre saw, having
a reciprocating saw blade accommodated on the underside

of a fixed, forwardly directed sabre, the rear end
section of which saw blade is accommodated inside the

machine casing, at the drive output, characterized in
that a suction duct (17) is attached to the underside of

the machine casing (13), the intake orifice (20) of which
duct extends from the front end (17a) of the suction duct

(17) to as far as beneath a longitudinal slot (21),
formed below the rear end section (12a) of the saw blade

(12), of the machine casing (13).
Sabre saw according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the intake orifice (20) of the suction duct (17) is

formed as a longitudinal slot beneath the rear end
section (12a) of the saw blade (12).
Sabre saw according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the suction duct (17) on the underside of the

machine casing (13), with a suction connection piece (18)
formed integrally at its rear side and running parallel

to the longitudinal axis of the tool, is designed as a
separate, removable part, by virtue of the fact that it

is pivotably suspended, in a hinge-like manner, from the
machine casing (13) in the region of the suction connection

piece (18) by means of a suspension device (19) and
can be latched to the machine casing (13) in the front

region using latching means (24, 25).
Sabre saw according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the suspension device (19) comprises an upright

tongue (23) at the top of the rear side of the suction
duct with an angled-off tongue end (23a) which engages in 

a transverse slot (22), formed on the underside of the
handle (14) on the machine casing (13), in the casing

wall (13a).
Sabre saw according to Claim 4, characterized in
that an integrally formed, U-shaped latching bow (24)

protrudes upwards on both sides of the front region of
the suction duct (17), which bow can in each case be

pushed over a latching lug (25) formed integrally on both
sides of the front of the machine casing (13).
Sabre saw according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the suction duct (17) has

an elongate shape with a rectangular cross-section, the
rear section (17b) of which ends by running obliquely

upwards into the suction connection piece (18).
Sabre saw according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the underside (17c) of the suction duct (17) is

designed as a planar resting surface.
