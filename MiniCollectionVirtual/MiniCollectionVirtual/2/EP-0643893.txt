<ABSTRACT>
A subscriber station realized according to the building block technology is linked to other stations by a bus which transmits pulses that stand for coded information which is processed in the station by means of at least one comparator. The comparator (8) is set in such a way that its switching-out threshold (12) is lower than its switching-on threshold (11).

<CLAIMS>
Subscriber station of building system 
technology, the station being connected to additional 

stations by way of a bus, on which pulses for coded 
information are transmitted, which are processed in the 

station by means of at least one comparator,
 
characterized in that the comparator (8) is adjusted in 

such a way that its disconnection threshold (12) lies 
at about 50% of its connection threshold (11) or lower, 

in order to correctly represent the duration of the 
pulse in the receiver. 
Subscriber station according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the disconnection threshold (12) 

is lower than 30% of the amplitude of the connection 
threshold (11). 
Subscriber station according to claim 2, 
characterized in that the connection threshold (11) is 

at about 1 v and the disconnection threshold (12) is at 
0.5 to 0.3 v. 
Subscriber station according to one of claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the subscriber station is 

coupled to the bus by an LC-element. 
Subscriber station according to claim 4, 
characterized in that as LC-element a transformer (4) 

with coupling capacitor (6) is used, with which the 
subscriber station (3) is coupled to the bus (1).
