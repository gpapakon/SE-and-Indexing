<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a clothes peg, consisting of two peg halves, each with a grip leg (12, 13) at one end and a clamping leg (10, 11) at the opposite end, the two peg halves being connected in an articulated manner in such a way that the two clamping legs (10, 11) are pressed against one another by means of a spring force. The clothes peg according to the current invention is characterized in that the grip legs (12, 13) can be fixed in different spaced positions relative to one another and the clamping effect on the clamping legs (10, 11) can thereby be adjusted variably. According to a preferred embodiment, this is achieved in that one grip leg (12) is prolonged at the upper end and catch recesses (15) are formed on this in the region of the prolongation, in different spaced positions, for catching the tip (16) of the other grip leg (13).
