<ABSTRACT>
The container for viscous masses consists of a cylindrical housing (9) and a pressing-out arrangement, the housing (9) being divided into two separate chambers (11) by a partition (10), arranged in the longitudinal direction, an outlet opening (12, 13) being provided in each case at the upper end of each chamber and a semicircular piston being provided in each chamber (11), which piston is displaceable in the direction of the outlet opening. The surface of the bottom (8) of the piston has a curvature (1) pointing in the direction towards the pasty mass whereas, on the underside of the piston, several ribs (5, 6) are provided and a sealing lip (2) is provided along the outside edge (3) of the bottom of the piston. The outlet openings (12, 13) can be closed hermetically by a closure stopper (15) which can be inserted and screwed on.

Container for pasty compositions consisting of a 
cylindrical housing (9) which is subdivided into two 

separate chambers (11) by a dividing wall (10) arranged 
in the longitudinal direction, one outlet opening 

(12, 13) in each case being provided at the upper end of 
each chamber and there being arranged in each chamber a 

semicircular piston which is movable towards the outlet 
opening and whose surface (1) in contact with the pasty 

composition has a domed formation towards the pasty 
composition and whose underside has reinforcing parts 

(5, 5', 6, 6'), characterised in that the outer edge of 
the piston is provided with a sealing lip (2) whose outer 

surface (3) is arranged at an angle (α) to the piston 
wall (4) and in that the reinforcing parts are ribs of 

different heights which are arranged between the straight 
and the semicircular section of the piston at an angle to 

one another such that the intersecting points of the 
imaginary axes extending the ribs lie outside the 

semicircular piston. 
Container according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that four ribs are provided of which the two inner ribs 

(6, 6') have a lesser height than the two outer ribs 
(5, 5'). 
Container according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that a circular reinforcing part (7) is arranged between 

the two inner ribs (6, 6'). 
Container according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the angle (α) of the outer 

surface (3) of the sealing lip (2) to the piston wall (4) 
is between 10 and 30° and is preferably 20°.  

 
Container according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that there can be inserted into 

the two outlet openings (12, 13) a closure plug (15) 
which has projections (16, 17) which are adapted to the 

outlet openings, which closure plug (15) can be fastened 
by a union nut (18) which can be screwed on.
