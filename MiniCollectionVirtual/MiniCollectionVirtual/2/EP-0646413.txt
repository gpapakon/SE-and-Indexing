<ABSTRACT>
Catalytic composition and a process for the dimerisation, comerisation and oligomerisation of olefins, the said compositions resulting from the mixing of at least one divalent nickel complex containing two molecules of tertiary phosphene, of at least one nickel complex containing no water and of phosphene and of at least one alkyl alumium halide. this mixture is particularly usable in nonaqueous liquid compositions of ionic nature, for example those formed by quaternary ammonium halides and/or quaternary phosphonium halides with aluminium halides and/or alkyl aluminium halides.
