<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a color toner for
developing electrostatic images, a process for its
production, and a color image forming method.As electrophotography, a large number of
methods are known in the art as disclosed, for
example, in U.S. Patent No. 2,297,691. In general, in
this electrophotography, an electrostatic latent image
is formed on a photosensitive member, utilizing a
photoconductive material and according to various
means, and subsequently the latent image is developed
using the toner to form a toner image. The toner
image is transferred to a transfer medium such as
paper if necessary, and then the toner image thus
transferred is fixed to the transfer medium by
heating, pressing, heat-pressing or using solvent
vapor. A copy is thus obtained.Various methods have been hitherto proposed as
methods for developing latent images using toners and
methods for fixing toner images, and methods suited 
for their respective image forming processes are
employed.Toners used for such purposes have been
commonly produced by melt-kneading a thermoplastic
resin and a colorant comprising a dye and/or a pigment
to uniformly disperse the colorant in the
thermoplastic resin, followed by cooling,
pulverization and classification to obtain a toner
having the desired particle diameters.This production process (a pulverization
process) can produce reasonably good toners, but have
certain kinds of limitations, for example, a
limitation to the range of selecting toner materials.
For example, dispersions of resins with colorants must
be brittle enough to be pulverizable by an
economically usable production device. Since the
dispersions must be made well brittle, groups of
particles having a broad range of particle diameter
tend to be formed when actually pulverized at a high
speed. In particular, a problem may arise such that
particles excessively pulverized tend to be included
in such groups of particles in a relatively large
proportion. Moreover, materials with such a
brittleness tend to be further pulverized or powdered
when actually used for development in image forming
apparatus such as copying machines. In the pulverization process, it is not easy
to uniformly disperse fine solid particles such as
colorants in resins. An increase in fog and a
decrease in image density may be caused depending on
the degree of dispersion of such fine solid particles,
and hence a great care must be taken. Colorants
coming bare to rupture cross-sections of resin
particles colored with the colorants may cause
variations in
