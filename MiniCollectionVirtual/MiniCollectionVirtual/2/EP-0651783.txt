<ABSTRACT>
The present invention involves the construction of several mutations in the (Escherichia coli) alkaline phosphatase gene, that result in the production of an enzyme having an improved specific activity. The resultant mutant enzymes have up to 1.5- to 36-fold higher specific activity, while retaining a temperature stability that is significantly higher than that of mammalian alkaline phosphatase enzymes. The utility of mutant (E. coli) alkaline phosphatase as an enzyme label in binding assays is also demonstrated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the modification of enzymes to improve
their biological properties. In particular, the invention relates to the use of a
genetically engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli) to produce alkaline phosphatase
for use as a label in binding assays, wherein the enzyme has an enhanced specific
activity and a high thermal stability.Alkaline phosphatase is used as a readily detectable labeling enzyme
in various diagnostic binding assays. For example, it is frequently used in
heterogeneous enzyme binding assays wherein it may be coupled, depending
upon the type of analysis, to an antigen, antibody or other specific binding
member which will bind to the analyte of interest. After binding has
occurred, the newly formed binding complex may be separated from the
reaction mixture and detected by observing the presence or amount of
alkaline phosphatase associated with the complex. The alkaline phosphatase
is detected by adding an enzyme substrate and observing the extent of the
resultant enzyme/substrate reaction.The criteria for choosing any particular enzyme for use as a label
include: a high specific activity (i.e., a high rate of catalysis or high
velocity of the enzymatic reaction); stability at high temperatures (usually
a melting temperature of greater than 50-60째C); stability of the enzyme
after conjugation to the specific binding member, the availability of easily
quantifiable enzyme substrates for use in the enzyme detection reaction; the
availability of reaction product amplification methods; and suitable
performance in the assay (e.g., low background readouts). Temperature
stability is a major concern for many industrial applications of enzymes.
Proteins vary with respect to their temperature stability, and the melting 
temperatures (Tm) of different enzymes can range from less than 40째C to
greater than 100째C.Calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase is often used as an enzyme label,
exhibiting both a high specific activity and a melting temperature of about 55째C.
The enzyme and its conjugates are convenient to use in binding assays, and there
are several methods of amplifying the product of the detection reaction. The use
of calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase as a label, however, still presents some
disadvantages. These disadvantages include inadequate purity of some enzyme
preparations and the presence of covalently linked carbohydrates which are
believed to contribute to higher background readings when determining assay
results. In addition, calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase
