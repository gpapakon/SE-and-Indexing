<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus capable of forming a dual 
tube conduit having a predetermined outer tube dimension, 

a predetermined inner tube dimension, and a predetermined 
gap between the tubes. A dual tube workpiece (W) is 

initially bent in one or more zones to a desired 
nonlinear configuration, the inner tube (50) and outer 

tube (52) are hydroform expanded simultaneously to obtain 
the selected inner tube dimension, and the outer tube is 

then hydroform expanded to the desired outer tube 
dimension and to the desired gap therebetween, while the 

inner tube is held constant.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hydroforming of dual 
wall tubular products such as engine exhaust conduits, 
and particularly to hydroforming such products to obtain 
a uniform controlled spacing or gap between the inner and 
outer walls. In US-A-5 170 557 a hydroforming process is 
described for forming a dual wall conduit, with a minimum 
air gap between the inner and outer walls being assured. 
Often it is desirable to have a predetermined uniform air 
gap, not just a minimum gap, between the walls. 
Specifically, for example, an auto manufacturer may want 
a dual wall engine exhaust conduit with a 63.5 mm (two 
and one-half inch) outer wall diameter and a 57.15 mm 
(two and one-quarter inch) inner wall diameter, and a 
uniform spacing or gap between them. The prior known 
technology does not enable that to be assured. This is 
particularly so when the dual wall conduit is bent into 
various nonlinear configurations, as is usually done. 
Such bending tends to cause reduction in the conduit 
diameter, i.e., necking down of the walls, at the bend 
zones, and formation of wrinkles or bulges adjacent the 
bend zones. When subsequently hydroform expanded in the 
conventional way in which only the outer wall is expanded 
outwardly to the surface of the hydroforming die cavity, 
the result is an air gap of differing amounts and 
configurations along the conduit length. An object of this invention is to provide a method 
and apparatus capable of forming a dual tube conduit, 
even one with a nonlinear configuration, having a 
predetermined outer tube dimension, a predetermined inner 
tube dimension, and a predetermined uniform desired 
spacing or gap between the tubes.  
 The invention is set out in the independent claims. The dual tube workpiece is initially bent in one or 
more zones to the desired nonlinear configuration, the 
inner and outer tubes are hydroform expanded 
simultaneously to obtain the selected inner tube 
dimension, and the outer tube is then hydroform expanded 
to the desired outer tube dimension and to the desired 
gap or spacing therebetween, while the inner tube is held 
constant. The inner tube has openings along its length, 
specifically adjacent to and spaced somewhat from the 
ends thereof. During the time that both the inner and 
outer tubes are expanded simultaneously, these openings 
are sealed with an end plug seal so that hydroforming 
fluid only enters the inner tube to expand both tubes to 
a first selected dimension. This not only gives a 
controlled expansion but also reverses
