<ABSTRACT>
The inner telescopically extendable section of a crane with a telescopic tower fastened to a revolving superstructure or the rotating deck of a portal is connected to a jib in an articulated manner. The jib consists of an inner jib articulation piece, a jib centre piece and an outer jib extension and is stayed relative to a fixed point on the revolving superstructure or rotating deck by stay ropes which run over stay supports. In order to shorten and simplify the erection and dismantling of the crane, the jib articulation piece is connected to the jib centre piece about a transverse axis located in the area of the top chords, and the jib centre piece is connected to the jib extension about a transverse axis located in the area of the bottom chords. A centre stay support which is articulated in the outer end area of the jib articulation piece and from which the stay rope of the jib extension runs to a fixed point on the jib extension can be pivoted in the direction of the jib articulation piece by an auxiliary winch.
