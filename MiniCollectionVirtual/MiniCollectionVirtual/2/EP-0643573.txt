A hair-setting preparation based on an alcoholic or aqueous/alcoholic 
solution containing film formers, solvents, propellants and typical cosmetic 

components, characterized by a) a propellant mixture consisting of a gaseous 
propellant A, which is insoluble in the solution or of which less than 5% by 

volume is soluble therein at 20°C/1 bar partial pressure, and a gaseous 
propellant B, of which at least 40% by volume is soluble in the solution at 20°C/1 

bar partial pressure, in a ratio by weight of 3:1 to 1:10 and b) a dynamic 
viscosity of the solution of 1.5 to 10 mPas at 20°C. 
A preparation as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the propellant 
A is air or nitrogen. 
A preparation as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
propellant A is present in a quantity of 0.1 to 1.5% by weight, based on the 

preparation as a whole. 
A preparation as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the 
propellant B is carbon dioxide or dinitrogen oxide. 
A preparation as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the 
propellant B is present in a quantity of 0.2 to 8% by weight, based on the 

preparation as a whole. 
A preparation as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 
dynamic viscosity of the solution at room temperature is between 1.5 and 8 

mPas. 
A preparation as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that a 
nonionic or anionic polymer is present as the film former (b). 
A preparation as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the 
film former is present in a quantity of 1 to 7% by weight and more particularly 3 

to 7% by weight. 
A preparation as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that it 
is free from preservatives. 
A process for the treatment of hair, characterized in that the preparation 
claimed in any of claims 1 to 9 is used.
