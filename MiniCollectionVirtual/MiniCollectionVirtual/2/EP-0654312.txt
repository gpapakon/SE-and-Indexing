<ABSTRACT>
Device for the production of corrugated sheets having plane-parallel marginal portions with a hydraulic or mechanical press comprising at least one hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder and in each case at least one upper and lower embossing tool (3, 4), the embossing tools (3, 4) being provided at their mutually remote ends (5) with embossing-tool end pieces (6, 7) in which are arranged integrated hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders (8, 9) with contour punctures (10, 11) which are designed to be capable of motion relative to movements at the upper embossing tool (3), and a method for the production of corrugated sheets with plane-parallel marginal portions in a hydraulic or mechanical press, open corrugations being formed in a sheet (15), the forming process including the marginal portions (16) associated with each corrugation, and these marginal portions then being deformed back into the initial plane occupied by the sheet before the forming of the corrugation.

An apparatus for manufacturing beaded metal sheets with plane-parallel
outer edge faces,

having a hydraulic or mechanical press comprising at least one hydraulic or pneumatic
cylinder and comprising at least one upper and lower stamping tool (3, 4) in each case

which are provided with stamping tool end pieces (6, 7) at their ends (5) facing away from
each other, characterised in that hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders (8, 9) having contoured

dies (10, 11) are disposed in the stamping tool end pieces (6, 7), which contoured dies are
constructed so that they can move in relation to movements of the upper stamping tool

(3).
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the contoured dies (10, 11) are
constructed so that they can move in the same directions as the upper stamping tool (3).
An apparatus according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the contoured dies (10,
11) can move in opposite directions to the directions of movement of the upper stamping

tool (3).
An apparatus according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the lower stamping tool (4)
is fixed to a press table (14) of the press (1).
An apparatus according to claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the stamping tool end pieces
(6, 7) are immovably attached to the stamping tools (3, 4).
An apparatus according to claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the contoured dies (10, 11)
are provided with contours (12, 13) which correspond to those of the stamping tools (3,

4) attached to them. 
A process for manufacturing beaded metal sheets with plane-parallel
outer edge faces in

a hydraulic or mechanical press, wherein open beads are formed in a metal sheet (15) by
upper and lower stamping tools (3, 4), with the inclusion of outer edge faces (16) which

are each associated with a bead, characterised in that the outer edge faces are then formed
back again into their metal sheet initial plane which they take up before the bead is formed,

whilst the metal sheet is clamped between the upper and lower stamping tools (3, 4) of
the press (1).
