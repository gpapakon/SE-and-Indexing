<ABSTRACT>
A cold shield having an evacuated enclosure having a first aperture 
therein for transmission of radiations and a baffle disposed within the enclosure 

having a second aperture larger than the first aperture and aligned with the 
first aperture and having a detector disposed on a surface thereof opposite the 

second window. The first aperture includes a radiation transmissive member 
and a radiation opaque member disposed on the surface of the radiation 

transmissive member and external to the evacuated enclosure. A radiation band 
pass filter is disposed on the radiation transmissive member. The interior of the 

baffle is coated with an absorptive low reflecting material and the exterior 
surface of the baffle opposing the first aperture is coated with an absorptive low 

reflecting material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cold shield and cold filter for infrared detector
arrays.The sensitivity of infrared detectors depends upon both their signal
response and upon the noise associated with the detection process. The most
sensitive such detectors are photon detectors, that is, those detectors whose
signal response is proportional to the number of photons incident thereon. The
limit of performance of such detectors is set by the random fluctuations in the
rate at which background photons are received. Detectors for which this is true
are generally referred to as "background limited". The magnitude of the
fluctuation energy is very nearly proportional to the total number of photons
detected. It follows that, for photon detectors, the output signal-to-noise ratio is
maximized by rejecting all radiation that does not contribute appreciably to the
signal while accepting all radiation that does so contribute.Radiation which contributes to the signal at the detector plane is defined
in two ways: (1) geometrically and (2) spectrally. The geometric definition is
determined by the optical system associated with the detector array. All energy
gathering and imaging optical systems have an aperture and an aperture stop
which determines how much energy is gathered by a detector element. The
spectral definition is determined by the type of radiation source being detected,
modified by the spectral transmission of the atmosphere intervening between 
the source and the optics and detector. Maximizing the signal requires that the
vacuum chamber, generally a Dewar, be so constructed that as much of the
geometric and spectral content of the signal as possible be accepted.Maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio requires a balance between the
amount of signal collected and the amount of noise generated by the total photon
flux. Geometrically, both maximizing the signal collected and minimizing the
non-signal radiation collected can be accomplished by making the aperture stop
a physical part of the detector. Any surfaces that are within the view of the
detector array outside the aperture stop must be cold and black (highly emissive
and low reflecting) so that they produce a negligible photon flux at the detector
array. These surfaces are usually cooled by the same cooling mechanism
employed to cool the detector array. All known "background limited" photon
detectors must be cooled to reduce other detector noise mechanisms to a level
below that induced by the background flux. The photon detectors are mounted
in thermal
