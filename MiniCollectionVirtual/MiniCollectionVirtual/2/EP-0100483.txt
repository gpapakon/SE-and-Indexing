<ABSTRACT>
A composite material comprising a radiation image 
storage panel provided with a phosphor layer containing a 

stimulable phosphor, and a light-shielding bag for enclosing 
the radiation image storage panel. The light-shielding bag is 

made of a material interrupting stimulating rays which excite 
the stimulable phosphor, but permeable to a radiation 

passing through an object.

 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 Field of the Invention
 This invention relates to a composite material for storage of a radiation image, which comprises a radiation image storage panel.


 Description of the Prior Art
 As is well known, there is widely used a radiographic method wherein an X-ray photographic film is exposed to a radiation passing through an object to record an X-ray transmission image of the object for viewing, particularly for diagnostic purposes. In conventional radiography, intensifying screens are used together with the X-ray photographic film in order to intensify the sensitivity to
X-rays. In general, the radiography is conducted by interleaving the X-ray photographic film between two intensifying screens, loading the obtained combination in a light-shielding cassette, and loading the cassette in an image recording stage.


 However, in mammography, dental image recording or the like, it is impossible to use the cassette as described above. In such a case, therefore, a radiation image is recorded by inserting the X-ray photographic film and the intensifying screens in a light-shielding, bag-like holder.


However, in this method, since the X-ray photographic film and the intensifying screens are simply inserted into the holder and not put into close contact with each other, the image quality of the obtained X-ray transmission image is deteriorated, and it is not possible to obtain an X-ray  transmission image suitable for viewing, particularly for diagnostic purposes. This presents a very real problem particularly when the X-ray photographic film and the intensifying screens are bent according to the shape of the object in dental panoramic image recording from the outside of the mouth, or the like. In order to eliminate the problem due to loose contact of the X-ray photographic film with the intensifying screens, there has heretofore been used a method wherein the bag-like holder is evacuated to improve contact of the X-ray photographic film with the intensifying screens.
However, it is very troublesome to evacuate the bag-like holder, and forming of the bag-like holder so as to be capable of being evacuated results in higher cost of image recording.


 One novel method for recording and reproducing a radiation image without using the X-ray photographic film is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,239,968. In this radiation image recording and reproducing method, there is used a radiation image storage panel comprising a stimulable phosphor which emits light when stimulated by an
