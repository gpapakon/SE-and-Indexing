A pallet changing apparatus for machine tools, having a 
pallet support (20) mounted on a displaceable slide (14), 

which comprises pallet guides for supporting a pallet 
during the machining operation, having a transfer station 

(50) comprising pallet guides, having a rocker (42) 
mounted rotatably on the slide by means of a shaft, on 

the shaft of which a toothed wheel (38) is seated, having 
a toothed rack (24) fixed to the machine, with which the 

toothed wheel meshes, in order to swivel the rocker 
during a displacement of the slide, whereby the rocker 

engages in a groove in the pallet and during its 
swivelling motion the pallet moves between the pallet 

guides of the pallet support and the pallet guides of the 
transfer station,
characterised in that
 the pallet guides (22) of the 
pallet support (20) are disposed at right angles to the 

direction of displacement of the slide (14) during the 
pallet change,
in that
 a bridge table (28) is disposed between the 
pallet support (20) and the transfer station (50),
in that
 the bridge table (50) is displaceable parallel to 

the direction of displacement of the slide (14) and 
comprises pallet guides (30) disposed at right angles to 

this direction of displacement,
in that
 the bridge table (50) is displaced together with 
the pallet support (20) during the pallet change, whereby 

the pallet guides (22 and respectively 30) of the pallet 
support (20) and of the bridge table (28) align,
and in that
 in the transfer position the pallet guides 
(30) of the bridge table (28) align with the pallet 

guides (52) of the transfer station (50).  
 
A pallet changing apparatus according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the bridge table (28) is entrained 
by an entraining device (34, 40) of the slide (14) during 

its displacement. 
A pallet changing apparatus according to Claim 2,
characterised in that
 the entraining device (34, 40) 
becomes disengaged as soon as the bridge table (28) 

reaches the transfer position. 
A pallet changing apparatus according to Claim 3,
characterised in that
 the entraining device comprises a 
driving roller (34) disposed on the bridge table (28) and 

a driving cam plate (40) seated on the shaft (36) of the 
rocker (42), whereby the driving cam plate (40) extends 

over a limited circumferential portion (40b) with a 
constant radius concentrically to the shaft (36) and the 

driving roller (34) is supported on this circumferential 
portion (40b) of the driving cam plate (40) during the 

entrainment of the bridge table (28). 
A pallet changing apparatus according to Claim 3 or 4,
characterised in that
 a toothed rack (32), which is 
disposed parallel to the toothed rack (24) fixed to the 

machine, is mounted on the bridge table (28),
and in that
 the toothed wheel (38) engages in this 
toothed rack (32) in order to secure the bridge table in 

the transfer position as soon as the entraining device 
(34, 40) is disengaged. 
A pallet changing apparatus according to one of the 
preceding Claims,
characterised in that
 the toothed wheel (38) has teeth 
only over a part of its circumference and in an initial 

position of the rocker (42) is faced towards the toothed 
rack (24) with its circumferential region not having  

 
teeth so that the toothed wheel (38) is completely 

disengaged from the toothed rack (32). 
A pallet changing apparatus according to one of the 
preceding Claims,
characterised in that
 the rocker (42) engages by a roller 
(46) in the groove (48) of the pallet (44),
and in that
 the roller (46) enters this groove (48) and 
leaves this groove (48) in the direction of the 

longitudinal extension of the groove (48). 
A pallet changing apparatus according to one of the 
preceding Claims,
characterised in that
 an engagement device (58, 60, 62, 
64) is provided, which swivels the rocker (42) at the 

start of the pallet change from its initial position so 
that the circumferential toothing of the toothed wheel 

(38) comes into engagement with the toothed rack (24). 
A pallet changing apparatus according to Claim 8,
characterised in that
 a door (54) closing the working 
area of the machine tools keeps the engagement device 

(58, 60, 62, 64) non-operational when the door (54) is 
located in its closed state,
and in that
 the opening of the door (54) sets the 
engagement device (58, 60, 62, 64) in operation.
