<ABSTRACT>
A modulator comprising a substrate (4); a waveguide (5) formed on the substrate for receiving incident light; 
two phase-shift light waveguides (6) diverging from the incident light waveguide (5) and formed on the substrate (4), 

the phases of light transmitted through the waveguides (6) change with the intensity of electric field; and an exit light 
waveguide (7) formed on the substrate (4) where the phase-shift light waveguides (6) joins each other. At least one 

of the phase-shift light waveguides (6) has a part (8) where the polarization is inverted. A transparent film may be 
formed on one or plural areas on the phase-shift light waveguides (6). A buffer layer (14) may be provided on the 

phase-shift light waveguides (6) or near it. On the part where no buffer layer (14) is provided, a film of transparent 
material may be formed partly or entirely in order to exert stress on the phase-shift light waveguides (6). Partly on 

one of the phase-shift light waveguides (6), there may be provided a member which exerts stress on it. A device (26) 

may also be provided for irradiating partly or entirely the phase-shift light waveguides (6) with light.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical modulation 
system for modulating a light beam transmitted through an 
optical waveguide by applying an external electric field. There is known a conventional optical modulation 
system comprising a light source, an optical device 
supplied with a light beam from the light source, and an 
electric field applying device for applying an electric 
field to the optical device. The optical device 
comprises a substrate, an incident optical waveguide 
formed on the substrate for receiving the light beam 
incident thereto, two phase-shift optical waveguides 
formed on the substrate to be branched from the incident 
optical waveguide for varying a phase of a transmitted 
light beam in response to an electric field intensity, 
and an outgoing optical waveguide formed on the substrate 
to join the phase-shift optical waveguides. In the conventional optical modulation system, 
however, a phase difference is caused between the 
branched optical waveguides even if the intensity of the 
applied electric field is equal to zero, depending upon  
 
manufacturing conditions of the optical waveguides. This 
results in fluctuation of a ratio of the variation of 
light intensity relative to the variation of the applied 
electric field, namely, fluctuation of an optical 
modulation efficiency. In addition, the conventional optical modulation 
system is disadvantageous in that the optical device 
tends to deteriorate when the magnitude of the applied 
electric field is great. It is an object of this invention to provide an 
optical modulation system capable of readily adjusting a 
phase difference when the intensity of an applied 
electric field is equal to zero. It is an object of this invention to provide an 
optical modulation device capable of avoiding 
deterioration of an optical device even if the magnitude 
of an applied electric field is great. This invention is characterized by provision of a 
substrate, an incident optical waveguide formed on the 
substrate for receiving a light beam incident thereto, 
two phase-shift optical waveguides formed on the 
substrate to be branched from the incident optical 
waveguide for varying an intensity of a transmitted light 
beam in response to a phase of an electric field, and an 
outgoing optical waveguide formed on the substrate to 
join the phase-shift optical waveguides, at least one of 
the phase-shift optical waveguides having a reversely  
 
polarized portion reversely polarized. This invention is also characterized by provision 
of a
