<ABSTRACT>
Flexible plastic films which are reinforced with surface-treated short fibres of about 0.3 to 10 mm in length, which are produced in particular by the calendering process, and are used in particular in roof building and tunnel construction; such flexible plastic films reinforced with short fibres have very good overall properties, in particular a high ageing resistance, a high load-bearing strength and a high mechanical and thermal stability.
