<ABSTRACT>
A method of mounting an electronic part (10) having 
a terminal portion (12) on a board (20) on which a circuit 

including a connection portion (22) is formed. It includes a 
process of forming a conductive layer (14) on the surface of 

the terminal portion (12); a process of forming, on the 
surface of the connection portion (22), a conductive layer (24) 

having a melting point different from that of the 
conductive layer (14) formed on the surface of the terminal 

portion (12); and a process of melting the conductive layer (24) 
having a low melting point in such a state that the 

conductive layer (14) of the terminal portion (12) is contacted 
with the conductive layer (24) of the connection portion (22), 

thereby fusing the conductive layer (24) having a low melting 
point onto the conductive layer (14) having a high melting 

point. Moreover, the method includes a process of 
forming a projecting portion (16) made of a heat-resisting 

material on the surface of the electronic part (10) around 
the terminal portion (12), and forming a conductive layer (14,24) on at 

least one surface of the connection portion (22) or the 

terminal portion (12); and a process of electrically 
connecting the connection portion (22) with the terminal 

portion (12) and allowing the projecting portion (16) to be 
contacted with the surface of the board (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new
electronic part mounting board and electronic part
mounting method.Along with the tendency toward the
miniaturization and enhanced performance of electronic
devices, the high density mounting for electronic parts
such as positive/passive devices have been required. To
meet the requirement for the high density mounting, the
miniaturization of the electronic part and the narrowed
pitch of a terminal portion have been advanced, and also
the surface mounting technique has been developed. A
conventional lead insertion system includes the steps of
providing lead holes on a printed wiring board; passing
lead wires of an electronic part through the lead holes;
and soldering connection portions of a circuit provided
on the printed wiring board on the side opposed to the
electronic part with the lead wires of the electronic
part. On the other hand, the surface mounting technique 
is generally known as methods of directly electrically
connecting/joining each connection portion formed on a
printed wiring board with each terminal portion provided
on an electronic part, without any lead hole for passing
each lead wire of the electronic part to the printed
wiring board therethrough.The examples of the electronic parts used in
the surface mounting technique include an angular chip
part of leadless type or mini-mold type, a cylindrical
chip part of leadless type, a part with a two-way lead
such as SOP or SOJ, a part with a four-way lead such as
QFP or PLCC, or a land grid array (LGA) package.One of the electronic part mounting methods in
the surface mounting technique is a solder reflow
method. In this method, solder layers are provided on
each terminal portion of the electronic part and on each
connection portion of a circuit provided on a printed
wiring board. In such a state that the solder layer
formed on the terminal portion is contacted with the
solder layer formed on the connection portion, the
solder layers are heated into reflow, to be fused to
each other, thus electrically connecting the terminal
portion of the electronic part to the connection portion
of the board. In the conventional solder reflow method, the
solder formed on the terminal portion of the electronic
part and the solder layer formed on the connection
portion of the circuit are both melted (reflow). For
example, in an electronic part such as an LGA package, a
lot of terminal portions are formed on the surface of
the package. Accordingly, in the case of using the
above solder reflow method, as is typically
