<ABSTRACT>
A device for the withdrawal and transferring of labels in 
labelling machines, comprising a rotating carousel (1) 

peripherally bearing at least one blade (12) to 
collect the labels (10) from a magazine (9), after first 

passing through a glueing device (8). The blade 
(12) also rotates partially about its own support 

shaft (18), said shaft (18) being equipped with a 
gearing mechanism (19) associated to a cogged 

sector (22) partially rotating in two opposite 
directions about a pivot (23). The blade (12) is 

solid, by means of its support shaft (18), to a 
mobile body (27) arranged peripherally of the 

carousel (1), a curved element (28) also being 
fixed to the mobile body (27), said curved element 

(28) having a similar curvature to the blade (12) 
and being arranged on the trajectory of the blade 

(12) in the rotation direction of the carousel 
(1). The curved element (28) receives glue 

when it passes through the glueing device (8) and 
collects the part of each single label that 

extends beyond the active curved surface (13) of 
the blade (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a group for collecting 
labels from a magazine, in labelling machines. DE-A-1 936 839 describes such a group corresponding 
to the preamble of claim 1. Usually such groups have a rotating carousel on 
which label collecting organs, known as blades, 
are mounted. The blades are provided with a curved 
active surface and contact with a glueing group 
whereat their active surfaces are coated with a 
thin layer of glue, before passing on to the label 
magazine. At the magazine, the curved active 
surface of each blade drags (without slippage) on 
a label, and thanks to the layer of glue picks up 
said label. In the prior art, the active surface 
of the label is at least equal to the size of the 
label. The length referred to above is of about 180-220 
mm, with the standard size of the carousel 
diameter being of about 400 mm so that the whole 
label-collecting group can be of a contained size 
in order to limit the mass of the entire labelling 
machine. If larger labels are to be used, the  
 
collecting group has to be increased in size as 
well, which obviously leads to an 
economic/practical drawback, namely that the rest 
of the labelling machine has to be increased in 
size and therefore will cost more to make, 
transport, and so on. The principal aim of the present invention is to 
obviate the above-mentioned drawbacks by providing 
a label-collecting group of standard dimensions 
but capable of collecting longer than standard 
labels, and in particular much longer labels than 
the lengths of traditional blade active surfaces 
have up to now permitted. These and other aims besides are all attained by 
the label-collecting group for labelling machines, 
constituted by a rotating carousel peripherally 
bearing at least one blade to collect the labels 
from the magazine, after first passing through the 
glueing group. The blade also rotates partially 
about its own support shaft, said shaft being 
equipped with a gearing mechanism associated to a 
cogged sector partially raotating in two opposite 
directions about a pivot. The blade is solid, by 
means of its support shaft, to a mobile body 
arranged peripherally of the carousel, a curved  
 
element also being fixed to the mobile body, said 
curved element having a similar curvature to the 
blade and being arraged on the trajectory of the 
blade in the ratation direction of the carousel. 
The curved element receives the glue when it 
passes through the glueing group and collects the 
part of each single label that extends

A label-collecting group for labelling machines, 
constituted by a rotating carousel (11) 

peripherally bearing at least one blade (12) to 
collect labels (10) from a magazine (9), after 

first passing through a glueing group (8) the 
blade (12) also rotates partially about a support 

shaft (18), said shaft (18) being associated to a 
cogged sector (22) partially rotating in two 

opposite directions about a pivot (23), the cogged 
sector (22) being provided with a skate (24) 

slidably inserted in a track (25), virtually 
circular in shape and made in a fixed base (26) of 

the carousel (11),
 
characterised in that the blade (12), through the 

support shaft (18), is solid to a mobile body (27) 
arranged peripherally to the carousel (11), which 

mobile body (27) also bears bi-directional motor 
transmission organs of the cogged sector (22) 

movement to the support shaft (18) of the blade 
(12); a curved element (28) also being solidly 

fixed on the mobile body (27), which curved 
element (28) has a similar curvature to a  

 
curvature of the blade (12), and is arranged on a 

trajectory of said blade (12) in a movement 
direction of a carousel (11), the curved element 

(28) receiving glue when passing at the glueing 
group (8) and bearing a part of each label (10) 

collected by the blade (12) which part of each 
label exceeds a length of the curved surface of 

the blade (12); there being provided means for 
enabling the mobile body (27) to move with respect 

to the carousel (11) in order to enable the blade 
(12) to come into contact with the label (10) 

contained in the magazine (9) in order to carry 
out a collecting operation. 
A label-collecting group as in claim 1, 
characterised in that the means for enabling the 

mobile body (27) to move with respect to the 
carousel (11) comprise a skate (30) which is 

slidably inserted in a mostly circular track (31) 
made in the fixed base (26) of the carousel (11), 

the skate (30) being to the mobile body (27) 
and the track (31) exhibiting, proximally of the 

magazine (9), a deviation from a perfectly 
circular shape.  

 
A label-collecting group as in claim 2, 
characterised in that the deviation from a 

perfectly circular shape is such as to deviate the 
track (31) at a tract L2 externalwise of the fixed 

base (26) of the carousel (11). 
A label-collecting group as in claim 1, 
characterised in that the track (25) exhibits, in 

proximity of the deviation from a perfectly 
circular shape, a variation in curvature which is 

not of a circular shape. 
A label-collecting group as in claim 4, 
characterised in that the variation in curvature 

is such as to displace the track (25), over a 
tract L1, internalwise of the fixed base (26) of 

the carousel (11). 
A label-collecting group as in claim 1, 
characterised in that downstream of the magazine 

(9) in the rotation direction of the carousel (11) 
is a device which comes into contact with the 

curved element (28), which device presses a label 
(10) collected by the blade (12) against the 

curved element (28).
