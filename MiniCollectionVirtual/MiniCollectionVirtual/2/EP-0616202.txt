<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for the transfer of 
a measurement signal from a revolving roll used in 

the making of paper. In the method, detectors (5) 
are employed, which have been arranged over a 

certain width in the transverse direction of the roll 
(10), preferably as uniformly spaced, the measurement 

signals received from said detectors being 
passed to a unit (2) for reading and measurement of 

the detectors, which unit is installed preferably at 
the end of the roll (10). From said unit, the signals 

are transmitted wirelessly further as telemeter signals 
to a reading unit (3), which is placed outside 

the roll (10) and which is connected to a PC (7) or 
to an equivalent computer. In the unit (2) for reading 

and measurement of the detectors, a transponder 
in itself known is used, into which a code of its own 

is coded for each detector (5). The signals are processed 
in the whole measurement process as analog 

signals, and, in the transfer of the telemeter signals 
between the unit (2) for reading and measurement of 

the detectors and the reading unit (3) placed outside 
the roll (10), a substantially low transfer frequency 

of an order of 100...150 kHz is employed. The 
invention also concerns an equipment for the transfer 

of a measurement signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method for the transfer of a measurement signal from a 
revolving roll used in the making of paper, in which method detectors are employed, 
which have been arranged over a certain width in the transverse direction of the roll, 
preferably as uniformly spaced, the measurement signals received from said 
detectors being passed to a unit for reading and measurement of the detectors, which 
unit is installed preferably at the end of the roll and from which unit the signals are 
transmitted wirelessly further as telemeter signals to a reading unit, which is placed 
outside the roll and which is connected to a PC or to an equivalent computer. Further, the invention concerns an equipment for the transfer of a measurement 
signal from a revolving roll used in the making of paper, which equipment comprises 
detectors arranged in connection with the roll, over a certain width in the 
transverse direction of the roll, preferably as uniformly spaced, a unit for reading 
and measurement of the detectors, which is preferably installed at the end of the roll 
and to which unit the signals received from the measurement detectors can be 
passed, a reading unit placed outside the roll, the unit for reading and measurement 
of the detectors being arranged to transfer the measurement signals to said outside 
reading unit as telemeter signals, as well as a PC or an equivalent computer connected 
to the reading unit. In a number of different stages in the manufacture of paper, various nips are used, 
through which the paper web is passed. Examples of such nips include the roll nips 
and the so-called extended nips in the dewatering presses in a paper machine, 
calendering nips, and the nips in paper reels. For example, the transverse distribution 
of the nip pressure in a dewatering press, i.e. the distribution of the nip pressure 
in the axial direction of the nip rolls, affects the transverse moisture profile of the 
web that is pressed.  
 As is known from the prior art, as the press rolls, it is possible to use adjustable-crown 
rolls or variable-crown rolls (so-called KÃ¼sters rolls), in which the transverse 
distribution of the linear load in the press nip can be controlled by means of hydraulic 
loading members or by means of a chamber or a series of chambers pressurized 
by means of hydraulic fluid, respectively. The hydraulic loading members that are 
used in adjustable-crown rolls are, as a rule, regulated on the basis of regulation 
signals given by moisture and/or grammage detectors.
