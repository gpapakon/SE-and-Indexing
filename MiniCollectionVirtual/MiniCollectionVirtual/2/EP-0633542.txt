<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electro-optic devices and in
particular to optically addressed electro-optic devices.EP-A-488455 describes an electro-optic device which comprises a
substrate carrying an addressable matrix device such as a liquid
crystal display device or an image sensor. The rows and columns of
the matrix array of display pixels or imaging elements are accessed
by supplying signals along row and column conductors using an
electro-optic switching arrangement which comprises photosensitive
elements provided on the substrate carrying the matrix array. In the
arrangement described in EP-A-488455, the photosensitive elements are
driven by a linear array of light emitting devices such as light
emitting diodes or the like. Each row (or column) conductor is
associated with a unique pattern of photosensitive elements with each
photosensitive element being located at the intersection of the row
(or column) with a column (or row) conductor so that by activating a
given set of the linear light emitting devices a given set of column
(or row) conductors and the associated photosensitive elements are
illuminated causing the photosensitive elements to conduct. Each
unique, pattern of illumination of the linear light emitting devices
corresponds to a unique arrangement of photosensitive elements and
accordingly when a selected given set of light emitting devices is
activated all of the photosensitive elements associated with a unique
row (or column) conductor will conduct so coupling that row (or
column) conductor to the associated drive circuitry. Such an
arrangement enables a reduction in the number of components and
allows there to be comparatively few external connections to the
electro-optic device.According to the present invention, there is provided an
electro-optic device comprising a first substrate carrying an
electro-optic display having a first array of display elements and
conductors for addressing individual display elements to enable the 
display to display an image, a second substrate carrying a second
array of elements addressable by conductors and photosensitive
elements associated with the conductors for supplying, when
illuminated, signals along the conductors for accessing the elements
of the second array, the second substrate being provided opposite the
first substrate so that the photosensitive elements are associated
with selected ones of the display elements for enabling the selected
display elements to illuminate the photosensitive elements allowing
access of the elements of the
