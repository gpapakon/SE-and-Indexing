<ABSTRACT>
Flowing waters are dosed with acrolein to prevent excessive plant and algal growth. In order to avoid transport of acrolein, the process according to the invention, using the apparatus according to the invention, generates acrolein at the site of use by deacetylization of an acrolein acetal in the presence of an aqueous mineral acid, for which no electrical energy is required. According to the invention an acrolein acetal solution and an aqueous mineral acid solution are transported from pressure-resistant storage vessels (1) and (2) into a mixing chamber (11) by applying a pressure from a pressurized gas cylinder (3) and the mixture is passed through a deacetalization reactor; the reactor to be used comprises a tubular (14) and a vessel-like (15) part.
