<ABSTRACT>
The battery pack (1) is connected to an external device (9) and to a power supply circuit (10) for the external device (9), and 
it energizes the external device (9) or is charged by the power supply circuit (10). Communication is made between a microcomputer 

(11) inside the battery pack (1) and the external device (9) through terminals (8) and at least information representing a present 
residual charge of a battery (4) is transmitted from the microcomputer (11) to the external device (9). This residual charge is 

calculated by the microcomputer (11) using the current, voltage, internal resistance and temperature of the battery (4). In this way, 
the residual charge can be obtained with a high level of accuracy on the side of the external device (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a battery pack employed as a power
source for a portable telephone, personal computer or a video
camera.There has hitherto been known a battery pack constituted by
a secondary battery, such as a lithium ion, NiCd or nickel
hydrogen battery. Such known battery pack is in need of a
protective circuit which is arranged at a pre-set position within
the battery pack. A charging control circuit is separately
provided on a charger such as an ac adapter or on an external
unit such as a personal computer employing the battery pack. If
the excess discharging state is detected, the discharge is
discontinued appropriately.However, the voltage at each cell cannot be detected if
based solely upon the terminal voltage of the battery pack, such
that the residual capacity cannot be measured accurately.
Besides, if any one of the cells reaches a pre-set excess
discharge (over-discharge voltage), the discharge is discontinued
without regard to the terminal voltage.This is particularly inconvenient with an equipment, such
as a personal computer, in which it is necessary to carry out an
operation of data storage before discontinuing the discharge. Consequently, it is necessary to provide a system
for detecting the status of the battery based upon the
information stored in the battery pack.US Patent No. 4,455,523 disclosed a battery pack
connected to a power source circuit and to an external
equipment, the battery pack comprising a secondary
battery which may be charged and discharged and which
is made up of a plurality of cells and a control
circuit having means for detecting the status
information of the secondary battery (e.g. charge cycle
count, accumulated hours...), calculating the residual
capacity of the secondary battery based upon the status
information and transmitting the information indicating
the residual present or maximum capacity of the
secondary battery to the external equipment.
Accordingly, such a battery pack can be accurately
monitored in order to control charge or discharge of
the secondary battery when the battery pack is
connected to an external equipment. However, the type
of the battery pack cannot be identified which does not
prevent the external equipment to be connected to a
non-appropriate battery pack.In view of the above-described status of the art,
it is an object of the present invention to provide a
battery pack in which the information concerning the
secondary battery of the battery pack is suitably
transmitted to an external equipment in order to enable
accurate
