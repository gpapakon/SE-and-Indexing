<ABSTRACT>
A catamaran vessel includes two hulls (2) which are mutually connected by a cargo deck (3). A superstructure (7) which includes passenger spaces, for instance, is supported by a web structure which extends along a respective hull (2), generally along the outside of a respective hull (2). Each longitudinal side wall of the superstructure is formed from a laticework beam (5) whose plane is oriented generally vertically and whose longitudinal axis extends essentially horizontally. The latticework beams are fixedly connected to the aforesaid wall structures (4) and the floor and ceiling structures (58) of the superstructure (7) are connected to the latticework beams (5) so as to greatly stiffen the superstructure and to render the beams (5) highly resistant to bending forces, so that the spaces defined between the longitudinal profiles (51, 52) of the beams (5) and the struts (53, 54) will be essentially free of deformation forces when the vessel is at sea and thereby enable the spaces to be used essentially completely for windows, and so that the wall structures (4) can be given a relatively low natural bending resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-hull vessel of 
the catamaran type, which includes two or more hulls 
arranged in generally parallel and mutually spaced 
relationship and connected by means of one or more 
decks, and an overlying space in a superstructure which 
is supported by one or more wall structures extending 
from respective hulls. High speed, seagoing multi-hull vessels are constructed 
of two or more slim mutually parallel hulls which are 
joined together by means of one or more decks, which 
often carry cargo, including motor vehicles. Built on 
top of the deck or decks is a superstructure for accommodating 
passengers. The superstructure is supported on 
one or more wall structures extending from respective 
hulls. In principle, the wall structures may consist of 
the sides of respective hulls or vertical extensions of 
said sides. Large, high-speed catamarans may have a length of 100 
metres, a hull height of about 12 metres, a width of 40 
metres and propulsion machinery which will propel the 
vessel at a speed of 35 knots, for instance. The free 
space above the cargo deck may be 5 metres, for instance. 
It will be seen from these factors that when in 
motion, the vessel will be subjected to large bending 
and torsion stresses and also to large deformation 
forces, and that the aforesaid side walls are therefore 
conventional, simple metal plate walls which are extended 
the long sides of the superstructure, so as to form 
the stiffest possible side-beam structure together with 
respective hulls. Nevertheless, the stresses and deformation 
forces are still high in those regions which form 
the long-side walls of the passenger space, which limits  
 
the possibility of providing window openings in these 
walls. In conventional seagoing vessels, it is necessary 
to round the window openings so as to reduce the risk of 
stress concentrations. In spite of this, however, the 
elastic deformation of these window openings still 
remains highly troublesome and places high demands on 
the elastic attachment of the window panes or window 
glass. Accordingly, one object of the invention is to provide 
in multi-hull vessels of the aforesaid kind a superstructure 
construction which achieves a reduction in the 
deformation forces acting on the side walls of the 
passenger space, for instance, in operation, while 
providing the thus stiffened side-wall construction of 
the superstructure with larger free surfaces in which 
window glass, for instance, can be fitted. Alternatively,

profiles (51, 52) extend horizontally and whose planes 

are oriented generally vertically; and in that the 
latticework beams (5) are connected firmly to those 

walls which support the superstructure (7) from the

characterized
 in that a latticework beam (5) forms at 
least partially the body of a partition wall, wherein  

 
partition wall material is applied to the sides of the
