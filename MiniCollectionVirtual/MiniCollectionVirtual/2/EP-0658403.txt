<ABSTRACT>
An industrial robot, particularly for use as an inter-press 
robot, comprises a pair of arms (9, 10) rotatable 

around two axes (I, II) parallel to and spaced apart 
from each other, on which there are articulated two 

forearms (13, 14). The opposite ends of the forearms 
(13, 14) are mutually articulated around a common axis 

(15) and one of these forearms (14) rotatably supports 
a wrist (17) around a third axis (III) parallel to said 

first and second axis (I, II).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to industrial robots, 
particularly (but not exclusively) for moving pieces 
from one press to the other in a line of presses. The applicant has produced and marketed for a long 
time an industrial robot which may be used for the 
above mentioned application and known in the market as 
"Inter-press" robot (see for example US Patent No. 
4.661.040). US-A-5 107 719 discloses an industrial robot according to the preamble 
of claim 1. The object of the present invention is that of 
providing a new robot to be used particularly, but not 
exclusively, as an inter-press robot which has a 
simpler and lighter structure, which is faster in 
operation and is of a relatively inexpensive 
manufacture. In order to achieve this object, the invention 
provides an industrial robot, comprising: 
a base, a pair of arms rotatably mounted on the base 
respectively around a first axis and a second axis 
parallel to and spaced apart from each other, two motor and reduction gear units for driving 
rotation of said arms, two forearms respectively articulated at one and to 
said arms around two axes parallel to said first and 
second axes, and mutually articulated at their opposite 
ends around a common axis parallel to said first and 
second axes, characterized by: 
a robot wrist having a first body rotatably 
mounted on an extension provided at the opposite end of 
one of said arms around a third axis 
parallel to said first and second axes, a further motor  
 
and reduction gear unit being provided for driving 
rotation of said first body around said third axis, and a second body displaceable with respect to said 
first body substantially along a direction parallel to 
said third axis. In a preferred embodiment, said second body is 
connected to said first body by a parallelogram 
linkage, including a fourth axis perpendicular to said 
third axis. Furthermore, a flange is rotatably mounted 
on said second body around a fifth axis perpendicular 
to said fourth axis, two motor and reduction gear units 
being provided for driving the movement of said second 
body and said flange around said fourth and fifth axes. The robot according to the invention is 
characterised by a great flexibility in operation, 
since by controlling the position and speed of the two 
arms it is possible to obtain displacement of the piece 
carried by the robot (as usual, by a gripping tool 
connected to the flange of the robot wrist) along a 
predetermined path and with a determined law of 
displacement. Thus, for example,

<CLAIMS>
Industrial robot, particularly for moving pieces 
form one press to the other (2, 3) in a line of 

presses, comprising: 

a base (1), 
a pair of arms (9, 10) rotatably mounted on the 
base (1) respectively around a first and a second axes 

(I, II) parallel to and spaced apart from each other, 
two motor and reduction gear units (5, 7; 6, 8) for 
driving rotation of the two arms (9, 10), 
two forearms (13, 14) respectively articulated at 
one of their ends to said arms (9, 10) around two axes 

(11, 12) parallel to said first and second axes (I, II) 
and mutually articulated at their opposite ends around 

a common axis (15) parallel to said first and second 
axes (I, II), characterized by: 


a wrist (17) having a first body (18) rotatably 
mounted on an extension (16) provided at the opposite end of 

one of said forearms (14) around a third 
axis (III) parallel to said first and second axes (I, 

II), a further reduction gear unit (19) being provided 
for driving rotation of said first body (18) around 

said third axis (III), and a second body (20) 
displaceable with respect to the first body (18) 

substantially along a direction parallel to said third 
axis (III). 
Robot according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said second body (20) of the wrist (17) is connected to 

the first body (18) by a parallelogram linkage 
including a fourth articulation axis (14) orthogonal to 

said third axis (III). 
Robot according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the parallelogram linkage includes an upper arm (21) 

and a lower arm (21) arranged in a plane parallel to 
said third axis (III) and a further arm (21) parallel  

 
to and spaced apart from said plane and integrated in a 

single frame with said upper arm (21). 
Robot according to claim 2, characterized in that 
said second body (20) of the wrist (17) rotatably 

supports a flange (22) around a fifth axis (V) 
orthogonal to said fourth axis (IV). 
Robot according to any of the previous claims, 
characterized in that at least one of said arms (9, 10) 

or said forearms (13, 14) has a structure adjustable in 
length.
