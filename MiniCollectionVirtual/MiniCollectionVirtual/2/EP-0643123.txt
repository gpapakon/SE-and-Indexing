<ABSTRACT>
Halogenated organic waste streams (1) are treated 
by catalytic halogenation (2) in admixture with a hydrogen-rich, 

gaseous recycle stream (7) and a recycle stream (14) 
containing unreacted halogenated organic compounds. The 

resultant effluent (3) is condensed (4) and separated (6) 
to produce said gaseous recycle stream (7) and a liquid 

stream (8) containing hydrogenated hydrocarbonaceous 
compounds and hydrogen halide. Said liquid stream (8) is 

separated (9) into an anhydrous product stream (10) 
containing hydrogen halide and a stream (11) containing 

hydrogenated hydrocarbonaceous compounds and unreacted 
halogenated organic compounds. Said stream (11) is 

separated (12) into a product stream (13) comprising 
hydrogenated hydrocarbonaceous compounds and the recycle 

stream (14) containing unreacted halogenated organic 
compounds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of art to which this invention pertains 
is the production of a hydrogenated hydrocarbonaceous 
product and an anhydrous hydrogen halide stream from a 
halogenated organic stream. There is a steadily increasing demand for 
technology which is capable of treating an organic stream 
containing halogenated compounds to produce hydrogenated 
organic compounds and a hydrogen halide stream. The 
preferred hydrogen halide stream is anhydrous which 
minimizes the cost of building the processing plant based 
upon metallurgical considerations. With the increased environmental emphasis for the 
treatment and recycle of organic waste streams containing 
halogenated compounds, there is an increased need for 
improved processes to convert the organic waste stream to 
produce hydrogenated organic compounds and hydrogen halide. 
For example, during the disposal or recycle of potentially 
environmentally harmful organic waste streams, an important 
step in the total solution to the problem is to produce an 
organic stream which facilitates the ultimate resolution to 
produce product streams which may be subsequently handled 
in an environmentally acceptable manner. One environmentally attractive method of treating 
organic waste streams is by hydrogenation. Therefore, 
those skilled in the art have sought to find feasible and 
economical techniques to convert organic waste streams 
containing halide compounds to hydrogenated organic 
compounds and to recover the concomitantly produced 
hydrogen halide. In US-A-4,923,590 (Kalnes et al), for 
example, a process is disclosed wherein the effluent from a  
 
hydrogenation reaction zone is contacted with an aqueous 
scrubbing solution. In one embodiment, the '590 patent 
teaches that when the feed to the hydrogenation zone 
comprises halogenated compounds, the aqueous scrubbing 
solution preferably contains a basic compound to neutralize 
the acid. When the hydrogen halide is recovered however by 
means of some type of aqueous scheme or system, the 
metallurgy requirements become an economic consideration 
and, therefore, it has recently become highly desirable 
where possible to recover the resulting hydrogen halide via 
an anhydrous method. The invention provides an improved process to 
convert organic waste streams containing halide compounds 
to hydrogenated organic compounds and to recover the 
resulting hydrogen halide as an anhydrous product stream. The invention provides a process for treating a 
halogenated organic stream to produce a hydrogenated 
hydrocarb
