<ABSTRACT>
A machining oil composition comprises at least two 
ingredients, that is a lubricating base oil and a salt 

selected from sulfonates of alkali metals and the like. The 
composition may further comprise a metal composition 

selected from thiophosphates and the like, and/or sulfur-based 
extreme pressure agents. Since no chlorine-based 

extreme pressure agent is contained, little problem on the 
environmental pollution or the damage of incinerators is 

involved. The composition exhibits good machining or 
cutting performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a machining oil 
composition and more particularly, to an oil composition 
which is suitably adapted for use in broaching and tapping. 
The invention is applicable to the preparation of 
lubricants and machining of metals. Various types of compositions have been hitherto 
employed as an oil for machinings such as broaching, 
tapping and the like. In general, there are formulated, in 
base oils such as mineral oils, oils and fats or synthetic 
lubricants, various types of additives such as chlorine-based 
extreme pressure agents, sulfur-based extreme 
pressure agents, phosphorus-based extreme pressure agents, 
organometallic compound extreme pressure agents, oiliness 
improvers such as, for example, oils and fats, esters and 
the like, antioxidants, antirust agents, defoamers, antirust 
agents for non-ferrous metals and the like. Of the various types of extreme pressure agents, the 
chlorine and sulfur -based agents have been predominantly 
used owing to their good machining performance and relative 
inexpensiveness. The chlorine-based extreme pressure agents 
include, for example, chlorinated paraffins, chlorinated  
 
fatty acids, chlorinated fatty acid esters and the like. 
The sulfur-based extreme pressure agents include sulfurated 
fatty oils, polysulfides and the like. In recent years, however, where water-insoluble 
machining oils formulated with chlorine-based extreme 
pressure agents are used, there have been sometimes pointed 
out problems such as the ecological problem caused by 
generation of harmful substances at the time of incineration 
of the oils and the problem of damaging the incinerator. 
In addition, there is some fear on the possibility that a 
certain type of chlorinated paraffin is toxic and 
carcinogenic. Accordingly, there is a strong demand for the 
development of a machining oil or a machining oil 
composition which is substantially free of any harmful 
ingredients such as chlorine-based extreme pressure agents 
and exhibits good machining performance (e.g. a prolonged 
tool life). An object of the invention is to provide a machining 
oil composition which overcomes the problems of the prior 
art and which has better machining performance than 
machining oils comprising base oils to which sulfur-based 
extreme pressure agents alone are added. Another object of the invention to provide a  
 
machining oil composition which is free of any chlorine 
based extreme pressure agent whereby there can be 
suppressed the problems such as the ecological problem
