<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for indicating vehicle tire pressure comprises a transmitter unit (6) which is connected to a pressure monitor (20) that communicates with the air in the tire and is constructed to generate electrically an acoustic signal when the tire pressure falls beneath a given pressure level. Mounted on the vehicle is a receiver unit (3) which detects the acoustic signals, and an indicating device (4) which indicates air leakage. The acoustic signal comprises a first signal of a first frequency and a second signal of a second frequency, this second signal being produced after a given time interval. The receiver unit on the vehicle will not indicate an air leakage until the two signals have been received at the correct frequencies and at the correct time intervals. The transmitter unit (6) is attached to the wheel rim and connected to the wheel air valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
 i Tire Pressure Indication DeviceThe present invention relates to an arrangement which generates a warning signal when the air pressure of a vehicle tire becomes excessively low. In view of the increasing density and higher speeds of present-day vehicle traffic, it is highly essential that the tire pressures of private cars and commercial vehicles lie within the limits intended. This is important from the aspect of safety, since an excessively low tire pres¬ sure may cause a vehicle to skid and lurch unexpected¬ ly and, in the mildest case, result in damage to the tire. Further, the optimum wear conditions and rolling resistance conditions are lost when the tire pressure deviates from the correct intended level, resulting in impaired tire and fuel economy. Several endeavours have been made to provide a tire pressure monitoring device. An example of one such device is disclosed in Swedish Published Specification 7410559-4. Only a few of these devices have progressed beyond the prototype stage, and all of the devices known hitherto have been impractical, not sufficiently reliable, too expensive or have been encumbered with some other character defect which reduces their ability to be used effi- ciently in practice, for one reason or another. The object of the present invention is to eliminate this problem and to provide an inexpensive and reliable tire pressure monitoring device.This problem is resolved in accordance with the inven¬ tion, by providing on each wheel a pressure monitor which monitors the air pressure in the wheel and delivers an electrically generated acoustic signal. Further advantageous developments of the invention are defined in the subordinate Claims.A number of advantages are obtained when the acoustic signal is generated eleciricaiiy. For instance, this enables pressure monitoring to be effected electrical- 

ly more readily, which affords greater precision and greater reliability. In addition, the monitoring device is supplied with energy from an independent source, and the tire air pressure need not be utilized to this end, for instance. With an electric, or per¬ haps it should be said electronic, acoustic signalling device there is less risk that the acoustic device will be rendered inoperative by dirt and similar contaminates and therewith malfunction. The use of an electronic sound generator enables a relatively high tone to be generated which falls well within the audible window beneath a car. A suitable frequency in this respect is one which lies between 2,000-6,000 Hz, or

Claims
1. An arrangement for indicating vehicle tire pres¬ sure, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the device includes a transmitter unit which is connected to a pressure monitor which communicates with the air in a vehicle tire and which is constructed to generate electrically an acoustic signal when the tire pressure falls beneath a given pressure level.
2. An arrangement according to Claim 1, c h a r a c
t e r i z e d in that the arrangement includes vehi¬ cle-mounted acoustic signal detecting means.
3. An arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, c h r -a c t e r i z e d in that the acoustic signal pro¬ duced is comprised of a first signal which has a first frequency and a second signal which has a second frequency and which is generated at a given time interval after the first signal; and in that the vehicle mounted arrangement is constructed so as to indicate air leakage only when both signals are re¬ ceived at the correct frequencies and at the correct time intervals.
4. An arrangement according to any one of the preced¬ ing Claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the transmitter unit and/or the pressure sensor is mounted to the wheel rim and connected to the air valve of the wheel.
5. An arrangement according to any one of the preced¬ ing Claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the acoustic signal lies in a frequency band of 1,000-
10,000 Hz, and particularly in the frequency band of 2,000-6,000 Hz.
