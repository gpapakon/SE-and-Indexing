<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an improved 
double-mouth clip comprised of two 

symmetrical parts (1) having a large portion 
of their internal face provided with complementary 

teeth (2). Two extreme cradles (5) 
are formed from the extreme teeth and are 

manually actuated by the user for opening 
the jaw determined in the opposite area, said 

jaw being comprised between the imaginary 
transverse central line and the respective end 

tooth of the corresponding area. There is 
also provided a transversal wire ring or hoop 

(4) which maintains permanently closed the 
two jaws conformed between the two pairs of 

extreme cradles, each of the two component 
parts of the clip being provided, between the 

two last teeth of each of the extreme areas, 
with a rib (7) which is arranged transversally 

and centrally with respect to both ribs, while 
the last tooth of the opposite area is provided 

with a complementary groove (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to an improved double-mouth 
clip, with the peculiarity that it clamps by both ends and 
presents a symmetrical structure, both longitudinally and 
cross-sectionally. The applicant of such clip is also the owner of a 
utility model which claims a clip of the same type, i.e., 
formed by two symmetrical pieces with several cross-sectional 
teeth laid on at the central area, so that such 
teeth match each other as a consequence of the gap 
existing to allow such matching or insertion. Beginning 
from the last tooth, the pieces extend along their ends 
divergently by their inner face, i.e., in the form of a 
wedge. An outer slot is incorporated by each piece 
perpendicular to the teeth and corresponding to the 
central area, in order to insert either the ends of a wire 
spring or a strap, band or ring made of an elastomeric 
material, which forms the spring which keeps the clip 
closed by its both ends, so that when one of the ends is 
pressed, the other one opens, and vice versa. The clip, although it incorporates a great number of 
advantages compared with the traditional ones, presents 
the problem that, after a sustained use of it, one of the 
pieces moves sideways with respect to the other one. In 
certain circumstances, both pieces may become disengaged 
and, while it is easy to place them again in position, it 
is very upsetting for the user. The clip claimed herein 
solves this problem satisfactorily in an efficient and 
simple manner. For this purpose, it has been foreseen that 
each piece incorporates between the last teeth of one of 
its ends a projection laid transversally to such teeth, 
while on the last tooth of the opposite end it has been 
foreseen a recess to house such projection so that when 
both pieces of the clip join, due to the opposite laying, 
the projections of one side will be housed inside the  
 
recesses of the other, and vice versa, thereby producing a 
cross-sectional interlocking of both pieces, preventing 
them to move sideways. In an effort to better understand the main 
characteristics of the invention, a set of drawings is 
attached to this description forming an integral part of 
it and where, as an illustration and without limitation, 
the following has been represented: 
Figure 1 shoes a perspective view of one of the 
pieces of the clip which is the object of this invention. 
The other pieces are exactly symmetrical to the one 
represented. Figure 2 shows a longitudinal section of the clip 
where the elastic connection between both pieces is

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Improved double-mouth clip, formed by too symmetrical 
elements with matching teeth in the major part of the 

inner face. The outmost teeth determine a pair of end 
wedges actuated by the user to open the clamp determined 

at the opposite end. The clamp is included within an 
imaginary cross-sectional central line and the last tooth 

of the relevant area; it also incorporates a wire spring 
or cross-sectional band which keeps both clamps formed by 

the end wedge pairs constantly closed. It is essentially 
characterized in that each of both elements forming the 

clip itself incorporates between the last two teeth of one 
of the outmost areas a cross-sectional central projection, 

while the last tooth of the opposite area incorporates a 
matching recess or housing, so that when the projections 

and recesses of both clip elements are coupled, they 
determine a mean to prevent the sideways movement. of one 

element with respect to the other.
