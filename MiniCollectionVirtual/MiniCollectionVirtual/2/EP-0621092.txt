Device for the transfer of workpieces in a multiple stage press, in which the 
workpieces (11 to 13) are transported from stage to stage by pincers or the like 

secured to gripper rails (9, 9') movable in three dimensions, whereby at least 
one cross arm (19) arranged to the side of the workpiece (11 to 13), supporting 

the latter and attached to the gripper rail (9, 9') is provided, characterised in 
that the cross arm (19) projects into the press chamber and is displaceable 

and/or pivotable relative to the gripper rail (9, 9') or the workpiece (11 to 13) in 
the direction of transport. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the cross arm (19) is fixed in 
a longitudinal guide (21, 21') provided on the gripper rail (9, 9'). 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the cross arm (19) is 
mounted or guided in a longitudinally movable carriage (20). 
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that the cross arm (19) is 
mounted in a pivot joint (26) on the gripper rail (9, 9'). 
Device according to claim 4, characterised in that at its end an arm section (31) 
projecting over the pivot joint (26) of the cross arm (19) is guided in a link guide 

(28) or track guide so that the cross arm (19) performs a longitudinal and/or a 
pivotal movement. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
cross arm, preferably at its end facing the press chamber, comprises a locking 

shoe (23) and/or a collet and/or a gripper or the like pointing in the longitudinal 
direction of the press towards the workpiece. 
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that the locking shoe (23) is 
variably adjustable in its longitudinal position by an additional side arm (24) 

oriented in the longitudinal direction of the press.  
 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
cross arm (19) is designed to be displaceable in length telescopically. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that two 
opposite gripper rails (9, 9') each have a cross arm (19) which are differently 

adjustable in position and which are preferably arranged in the last stage of a 
multiple stage press. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
workpiece (11) is undone in the last press stage and the individual workpieces 

(12, 13) can be supported by the cross arms (19, 19') on further transport.
