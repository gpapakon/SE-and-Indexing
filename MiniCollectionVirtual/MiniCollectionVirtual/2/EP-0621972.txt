<DESCRIPTION>
 ALARM SENSORThis invention relates to a sensor for use in burglar alarm and/or a smoke alarm system. In a first aspect, the invention provides a senso comprising a case, a smoke detector within the case, th smoke detector communicating, in use, with the ambien atmosphere outside the case to allow smoke to be detected, and an infra-red detector within the case, the infra-re detector, in use, being able to detect infra-red radiatio outside the case,Sensors which include either an infra-red detector, or a smoke detector, are known in the art, but hitherto it has not been known to incorporate both such detectors into a single sensor as in the present invention.In the past, in order to obtain protection from a passive infra-red burglar detector and a smoke detector, it has been necessary to mount two such respective sensors in each room to be protected. Such an arrangement is relatively expensive because each sensor has to be provided with its own local alarm circuitry and a case. It is also inconvenient and sometimes unsightly to mount two such sensors in each room.With the present invention the two detectors can be monitored by local alarm circuitry, at least portions of which are common to both of the detectors, thereby reducing the cost and complexity of the alarm system. Furthermore, only a single sensor needs to be mounted in each room to give both smoke alarm and infra-red burglar alarm protection.One aspect which is believed to have led designs of sensors away from that of the present invention is that the installation requirements for a smoke detector generally conflict with the requirements for an infra-red detector. For example, a smoke detector is designed to be in direct communication with the ambient atmosphere of the room so that it can easily detect the presence of smoke. It is preferred that the air from the atmosphere around the 

 detector be allowed to flow into or through the case in which the smoke detector is housed. On the other hand, an infra-red detector is designed to be housed in a sealed case, because insects might otherwise be able to walk over the detector which might set the alarm off falsely.One application in which the above requirements can lead to problems is when the infra-red detector is a passive detector intended to detect the body heat of a burglar or other intruder. If an insect crawls across the surface of the detector, its body heat at such close distance may be sufficient to trigger the alarm falsely.Preferably, in the present invention, the interior of the case

CLAIMS
1. A sensor comprising a case, a smoke detector withi the case, the smoke detector, in use, communicating with th ambient atmosphere outside the case to allow smoke to b detected, and an infra-red detector within the case, th infra-red detector, in use, oeing able to detect infra-re radiation outside the case.
2. A sensor according to claim 1 wherein the interior o the case comprises a region open to the external ambien atmosphere, the smoke detector being arranged in the ope region, the sensor further comprising means for partitioning the infra-red detector from the open region.
3. A sensor according to Claim 2 wherein the means for partitioning the infra-red detector comprises substantially sealed chamber means within the case, at least a portion of a wall of the chamber means being substantially transparent to infra-red radiation to allow infra-red radiation to enter the chamber means, the chamber means enclosing the infra- red detector.
4. A sensor according to claim 3, wherein the transparent portion of the chamber wall comprises a portion of an external wall of the case.
5. A sensor according to claim 4 wherein the transparent portion of the chamber wall comprises an infra-red transparent window in an external wall of the case.
6. A sensor according to claim 5, further comprising means for enabling an indicator light within the case to be shone through the transparent window, to indicate that the sensor is armed.
7. A sensor according to claims 3, 4, 5, or 6 wherein the infra-red detector is mounted on a circuit board, the circuit board forming a wall of the chamber means.
8. A sensor accordingly to claim 7 wherein the smoke detector is mounted on the same circuit board as the infra¬ red detector.
9. A sensor accordingly to any of claims 3 to 8 wherein the case comprises front and rear case haves which fit 


together to form the case, the chamber means comprising a shroud attached to the front case half.
10. A sensor according to any of claims 3 to 9, wherein the chamber is substantially sealed from the open region. 11. A sensor according to any of claims 2 to 10 wherein the open region of the case communicates with the external ambient atmosphere through openings in the walls of £he case. 12. A case for a sensor according to any preceding claim, the case comprising a region for containing a smoke detector, the region, in use, being open to the external ambient atmosphere surrounding the case, the case further comprising a chamber for containing an infra-red detector, the chamber, in use, being partitioned from the region for containing the smoke detector, at least a portion of a wall of the chamber being substantially transparent to infra-red radiation, in use, to allow infra-red radiation to enter the chamber.
