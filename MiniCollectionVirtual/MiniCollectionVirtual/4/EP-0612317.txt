<DESCRIPTION>
 STJRSTTTΪTTED HETEROCYCLES AS ANGTOTENSTN TTANTAGONISTSPAC QROUNP OF I YE TTQThe compounds described in this invention as well as their non-toxic salts and pharmaceutical compositions containing them are useful for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. These compounds are also useful as lipid lowering agents.The renin-angiotensin system plays a well-defined role in cardiovascular homeostasis [Ocain, T.D. et al. (1991) Drugs of the Future 16., 37-51]. Angiotensinogen is converted to angiotensin I by the enzyme renin. Angiotensin I is then acted upon by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to form Angiotensin II (A II). A II possesses many crucial properties including vasoconstriction, aldosterone release, and water retention and is implicated as the cause of high blood pressure in a number of species including man. These hypertensive responses are the result of A II acting at specific receptor sites. Compounds which are able to compete with A II for these receptor sites but do not elicit agonistic receptor responses can be expected to counteract (antagonize) the hypertensive effects of A II.PRTOR ARTE. E. Allen et al describe 4-oxo-quinazolines in EP 0411766 A.D. A. Roberts et al describe quinoline ethers in EP 0412848 A.D. J. Carini et al in US. patent 4,880,804 describe N-substituted benzimidazoles. P. Chakravarty et al disclose similar imidazole structures in EP 0401030 A where the phenyl aromatic ring is replaced by a seven membered heterocycle.E. E. Allen et al disclose N-substituted oxopyrimidines in EP 0419048 A.Similar structures are reported in EP 0424317 A by P. Herold et al. 

 Our invention differs from the above mentioned prior art in that we disclose non-peptidic amino substituted nitrogenous 6 membered heterocycles fused to 5 or 6 membered aromatic rings. The non-peptidic A II antagonists disclosed in the above mentioned prior art are either oxo-quinazolines, quinoline ethers, benzimidazoles, fused heterocyclic imidazoles or oxo-pyri-midines.DESCRIPTION OF INVENTIONThis invention describes the composition and utility of novel heterocycles of the general formula Irwherein A is O, S, NR6, -CR7=CR8-;Z is O, S, NR6, -CR7=CR8-; X isH, NR9R10, OR11, CN, F, CI, I, Br, perfluoroalkyl, alkyl, alkyl-OH, alkoxyalkyl, -(CH2)nCO2R11,-(CH2)nCONR9R10; with the proviso that when Z= -CR7=CR8- then Y is NR13,NR13CR12R14, CR12R14NR13; with the proviso that when Z= O, S, NR6 then Y is NR13CR12R14.R1 is 5-tetrazolyl, CO2R11, SO3H, NHSO2CH3, NHSO2CF3;R2, R3, R4, R7, R8 is H,
