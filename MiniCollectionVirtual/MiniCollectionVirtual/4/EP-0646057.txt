<ABSTRACT>
The method proposed calls for the manufacture of fibreboard made of lump-form wood particles plus less than 10 % by wt. of polyurethane adhesive as binder. The wood particles are heated in steam at an overpressure and thus broken up to form fibres. The fibres are used at a concentration giving an overall bulk density of about 550 to 650 kg/m
<
3
>
 and the binder at a concentration of about 0.5 to 4.0 % by wt., in particular 1.0 to 3.0 % by wt., relative to the dry wood. The water vapour formed on heating is also passed, without preliminary condensation, through the drier and hence used to form a coating of polycarbamide which prevents premature reaction of the binder.

A method for the production of fibreboards made from pieces 
of wooden particles, and a polyurethane glue used as a binder in 

an amount of less than 10 percent by weight, in which the wooden 
particles are heated by pressurized steam and thus refined into 

fibres, the fibres being subjected to a blow line, being dried 
in a drying device, and then formed in the shape of a mat and 

pressed to form the fibreboards, 
wherein
 the fibres are applied 
in an amount resulting in a bulk density of the whole fibreboard 

of approximately 550 kg/m
3
 to 650 kg/m
3
, and where the binder is 
applied in an amount of 0.5 to 4.0 percent by weight, preferably 

in the range of 1.0 to 3.0 percent by weight, with respect to 
dry wooden particles, and where the steam generated during the 

heating of the wooden particles is passed through the drying 

device without having a portion thereof separated out and is 
used with the binder to form a coating layer out of polycarbamide 

to prevent the fibres from forming a preliminary reaction 
with the binder. 
The method of claim 1, 
wherein
 polyurethane glue is sprayed 
onto the fibres after leaving the blow line and before entering 

the drying device. 
The method of claim 1 or 2, 
wherein
 the pressure, temperature, 
and time during the production of the fibreboards are 

varied so that a profile of the bulk density over the thickness 
of the fibreboard results in which the outer layers have a bulk 

density of 750 kg/m
3
 to 950 kg/m
3
, and the middle layer has a 
bulk density of 550 kg/m
3
 to 600 kg/m
3
. 
A fibreboard made from pieces of wooden particles refined to 
fibres, and polyurethane glue as a binder in an amount of less 

than 10 percent by weight, 
wherein
 the fibreboard has a total  
 

bulk density of 550 kg/m
3
 to 650 kg/m
3
 and contains binder in an 
amount of about 0.5 to 4.0 percent by weight, preferably in the 

range of 1.0 to 3.0 percent by weight. 
The fibreboard of claim 4, 
wherein
 each outer layer of the 
fibreboard has a thickness of about 10 percent of the total 

thickness of the fibreboard, whereby a lean profile of the bulk 
density is formed. 
The fibreboard of claim 5, 
wherein
 the fibreboard has a bulk 
density in the outer layers of more than 900 kg/m
3
, and a total 
bulk density of less than 650 kg/m
3
.
