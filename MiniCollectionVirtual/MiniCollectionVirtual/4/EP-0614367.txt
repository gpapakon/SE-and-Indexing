<DESCRIPTION>
 SUBSTITUTED LACTOSE AND LACTOSAMINE DERIVATIVESAS CELL ADHESION INHIBITORSTechnical FieldThe invention relates to compounds useful in the treatment of inflammation, allergic reactions, autoimmune diseases, and related conditions. More specifically, the invention concerns substituted lactose and lactosamines that bind to the endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-l (ELAM-l) and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The present invention is also directed to synthetic methods useful in obtaining these analogs and other lactosamine and lactose derivatives.Background ArtIt is now well established that cellular interactions are at least in part mediated by receptor/ligand interactions. One class of receptors is known to recognize the peptide subsequence "RGD"; other receptors recognize carbohydrate ligands.One class of receptors that recognize carbohydrate-based ligands mediates the adhesion of circulating neutrophils to stimulated vascular endothelium. This is a primary event of the inflammatory response and appears to be involved as well in allergic and autoimmune responses. Several of the lectin-based receptors that are presumably involved in this process include LECAM-1 (gp90mel) ; gmp- 140 (PADGEM) and ELAM-l (LECAM-2) . Of particular interest herein is the ELAM-l receptor which has been shown to interact with the sialyl-Lewisx oligosaccharide (NeuAc(α2,3)Gal(j8l,4) [Fuc (αl,3)]GlcNAc. 

 U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/683,458, filed 11 April 1991 assigned to the present assignee and incorporated herein by reference discloses and claims the foregoing minimum 5 tetrasaccharide structure and identifies the groups putatively interactive with the ELAM-l receptor.The present invention provides analogs of the sialyl-Lewis1 residue which are agonists or antagonists of the ELAM-l receptor and related cell 10 adhesion receptors as well as an improved synthetic method to prepare both these analogs and compounds which are derivatives of lactose or lactosamine in general.15 Disclosure of the InventionThe invention provides agonists and antagonists which bind the ELAM-l receptor or other related cell adhesion receptors and thus modulate the course of inflammation and related responses. In this20 aspect, the invention is directed to compounds of the formula:30(i)'35 wherein each R1 is independently H or lower alkyl C1-4C) ;R2 is H, 'lower alkyl(1-4C) , alkylaryl or one or more additional saccharide residues; 

 R3 and R4 are each independently H, alkyl (1-6C) or aryl or R3 and R4, taken together,
