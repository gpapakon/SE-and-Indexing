<ABSTRACT>
The headlamp is of the projection design and comprises a reflector (1), a light source (2), a screen (3) and a lens (4). An aperture reflector (5) is situated below the headlamp axis (12) between the lens (4) and a refractor (6). The aperture reflector (5) has a reflective surface (51) which is inclined in a vertical plane to the headlamp axis (12) at an angle  alpha , which, together with the length (L), determines the intensity and geometry of the light beam above the horizontal axis in the vertical direction. The transverse dimension of the light beam above the horizontal is determined by radial cambering of the reflective surface (51) of the aperture reflector (5) or radius (Rx) and width (S) and/or by reflexive elements (52) on this reflective surface (51). The refractor (6) is provided with optical means with transverse and/or vertical deviation in a zone (61) which covers the aperture reflector (5) and the bottom part of the lens (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a headlamp of the projection type 
for motor vehicles which has increased intensity of 
illumination above the light-darkness boundary of the 
headlamp dipped beam or the fog light beam. In the usual elliptic dioptric headlamps comprising an 
integrating reflector, a screen, a lens and a refractor, the 
lens redistributes the light beam of the reflector so that 
it is nearly perfectly concentrated below the horizontal, 
while above it the intensity of illumination is minimal, 
with the exception of an asymmetric cut-off of the dipped 
beam. As a consequence, oncoming drivers are much less 
dazzled, but on the other hand inadequate illumination 
reduces registration of vertical traffic signs which have 
a relatively low level of surface brightness if illuminated 
by such headlamps. The low intensity of illumination above 
the light-darkness boundary makes also orientation of the 
driver in the upper part of his working space impossible. 
This can have adverse effect during driving on unlit 
twisting rural roads, especially in the absence of outline 
vision caused by the lights of oncoming vehicles. The above drawbacks are eliminated by a headlamp according 
to the invention which comprises a concave reflector 
integrating the light coming from the light source. In front 
of the reflector is situated a screen which limits and  
 
shapes the upper part of the dipped light beam or fog beam 
and a lens which projects the contrast of the brightness of 
the dark screen-shaded area on the light background of the 
reflector onto the road. Below the headlamp axis between the 
lens and the refractor, is situated an aperture reflector, 
the upper edge of which is the reflecting surface which is 
placed, in vertical section, between the headlamp axis and 
the operational diameter of the lens and extends 
approximately in the direction of the headlamp axis. The light beam, coming originally from the light source and 
reflector, is projected by the lens downwards but, after 
reflection by the reflective surface of the aperture 
reflector, it is directed upwards above the horizontal. The 
image of the light beam of the aperture reflector is 
vertically shaped by the length and inclination of the 
reflective surface of the aperture reflector. Lateral spread 
of this light beam is achieved by a suitable radial profile 
of the reflective surface of the aperture reflector in 
transverse direction and/or by application of reflective 
elements with transversal light diffusion on this reflective 
surfa
