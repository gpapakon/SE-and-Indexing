<ABSTRACT>
An electronic switching and data transmission system for 
interconnecting a plurality of buses. A switching network 

interconnects several multi-drop buses using adapters to connect 
the buses to the switching network. The adapters implements 

hardware functions to appear to software as if all devices on 
the several buses were attached to a single large bus. The 

system permits higher speed transfer modes by eliminating multi-drop 
bus limitations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present United States patent application claims priority as 
a continuation-in-part application to the following 
applications:
 
USSN 07/677,543, filed March 29, 1991, entitled "Allnode Switch 
- An Unclocked, Unbuffered, Asynchronous, Switching Apparatus", 
by Franaszek et al. USSN 07/946,204, filed September 17, 1992, entitled "Switch-Based 
Microchannel Planar Apparatus", by Olnowich et al. USSN 07/946,512, filed September 17, 1992, entitled "Switch-Based 
Personal Computer Interconnection Apparatus", by Olnowich 
et al. USSN 07/947,644, filed September 17, 1992, entitled "Slave 
Microchannel Converter Apparatus for Converting to Switch 
Architecture", by Olnowich et al. USSN 07/946,506, filed September 17, 1992, entitled "Master 
Microchannel Apparatus for Converting to Switch Architecture", 
by Olnowich et al. The descriptions set forth in these previous applications are 
hereby incorporated by reference. These applications and the 
present application are owned by one and the same assignee, 
International Business Machines Corporation of Armonk, New York.  This invention relates to new and useful improvements in data 
processing systems. More specifically, it relates to an 
apparatus for extending a bus architecture to allow many 
individual workstation or PC systems to perform high-speed 
communications in parallel while maintaining bus addresses 
constant and making the expansion transparent to software. The problem exists in PC's and workstations that there is an 
ever increasing need for better I/O bus performance and the 
attachment of more I/O options. This is in direct conflict with 
the nature of a multi-drop bus technology, which loses 
performance as more I/O options are added as taps to the bus. 
In general, standard bus architectures such as the microchannel 
bus (MC) have selected a performance goal and have backward 
engineered the number of I/O taps permissible at that 
performance level. In the case of the microchannel bus the 
result is that 8 taps (expansion cards) is the maximum number of 
allowable bus taps to permit bus operations to occur at 200ns 
cycle times. As a result MC users are beginning to find that 
the I/O capability is not sufficient to meet their needs. For 
years people having been looking for means of increasing the I/O 
capability of PC busses, and still require a good solution. Some machines have been packaged with separate microchannel 
buses in one cabinet to increase the number of expansion cards 
in one system. The disclosed solution is much more

computer system buses include a plurality of taps for 

connecting one or more computer system devices to said each 
of the computer system buses, and for each of the computer 

system devices to communicate to another computer system 
device connected to the same computer system bus via said 

same computer system bus, or to another computer system 
device connected to another computer syste
m bus via said 
same computer system bus, the network adapter, and the 

switch network. 
The apparatus according to claim 2 wherein each of the 
computer system buses have only one connected computer 

 
system device, thereby forming a point-to-point switch 

network computer system. 
The apparatus according to claim 2 wherein a portion of the 
computer system buses each have only one connected computer 

system device.

switch network without using a bus or network adapter. 
The apparatus according to claim 3 wherein each of the 
network adapters further include interface means for 

converting device and memory addresses sent over a 
connected computer system bus to network addresses for 

transmitting data to a computer system device connected to 
another computer system bus, and for converting device and 

memory addresses sent over the switch network to computer 
system bus addresses for transmitting data from the switch 

network to connected computer system devices. 
The apparatus according to claim 2 wherein the computer 
system devices include memory. 
An apparatus for increasing the capacity of a bus 
architecture by interconnecting a plurality of buses, the 

apparatus comprising:
