<ABSTRACT>
A roller valve lifter, especially of the 
hydraulic lash adjusting type for diesel engines, has 

an enlarged bronze roller shaft journal (50) for 
extended wear with a diameter at least half that of 

the surrounding skirt (39) of the lifter body (14) 
within which it is mounted. The roller/shaft assembly 

(43,48) is received in a recess (42) through the open 
bottom end (16) of the lifter body, the shaft (48) 

having mounting tangs (51) with flats (54) which 
engage abutments (56) in the recess to locate the 

roller in the recess. Retention is preferably by 
staking portions of the tangs into recesses in the 

skirt, preferably formed by openings (58) adjacent the 
ends of the tangs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to roller valve 
lifters for internal combustion engines. It is known in the art relating to roller 
valve lifters, particularly those used in diesel 
engines in highway trucks, to use a bronze shaft to 
journal the roller cam follower. The shaft is 
ordinarily pressed or staked into opposite openings of 
a transverse bore extending laterally through the 
roller end of the lifter to maintain the roller in a 
recess or pocket formed in and opening through the end 
of the lifter body. The recess is surrounded by a 
cylindrical portion of the body forming, in effect, a 
skirt for bearing against a bore of an associated 
lifter gallery. In order to extend the wear life of such 
roller valve lifters, especially those used in diesel 
engines where soot in the lubricant may increase wear, 
use of a larger diameter bearing journal is desired. 
However, installation of the shaft through the 
transverse bore limits the shaft diameter to something 
less than one half the diameter of the associated 
lifter skirt. US-A-4708102 discloses a lifter in 
accordance with the preamble of claim 1. DE-A-2941495 
discloses a lifter in which the bearing shaft is 
retained by deformed tongs on the side walls of the 
body. 
A roller valve lifter in accordance with the 
present invention is characterised over US-A-4708102 
by the features specified in the characterising 
portion of Claim 1. The present invention provides mounting and 
retention means for a roller and bearing shaft in a 
skirt pocket or recess which permits the use of a 
larger diameter bearing shaft providing increased  
 
bearing surface for improved wear life. The bearing 
shaft is preferably of known deformable bronze bearing 
material although other materials, such as steel, 
ceramics and the like, might be used if found 
suitable. The bearing shaft with the roller assembled  
 
thereon is installed in the preformed recess from the 
open end of the skirt and is retained in place by 
staking in discontinuities or openings in the skirt 
adjacent to the shaft ends. With this form of end loaded roller shaft 
installation and retention, it is possible to use a 
larger diameter shaft of greater than one half the 
diameter of the associated lifter body skirt and up to 
seventy or more percent of the diameter of the roller. The present invention will now be described, 
by way of example, with reference to the following 
description, and the accompanying drawings, in which:-

<CLAIMS>
A roller valve lifter (10) comprising a 
cylindrical body (14) having an axis, opposed first 

(16) and second (15) ends, and a recess (42) having a 
central opening through the first end and contained 

within a surrounding skirt (39) having a cylindrical 
outer surface (40); a roller (43) acting as a cam 

follower received in the recess, the roller having a 
round outer surface (44) and a bore (46) centred on an 

axis transverse to the axis of the cylindrical body; a 
bearing shaft (48) having a cylindrical journal (50) 

extending through the bore and journalling the roller 
for rotation thereon, the bearing shaft having opposed 

ends (51,52) extending axially beyond the roller into 
the recess along the axis of the roller to locate the 

bearing shaft in the recess with the roller centred 
and extending longitudinally partly beyond the first 

end of the cylindrical body; and retaining means for 
retaining the bearing shaft in the recess, the 

retaining means comprising portions (51,52) of the 
bearing shaft staked into discontinuities (58,60) of 

the skirt; characterised in that the central opening 
of the recess (42) is configured to permit 

installation of the bearing shaft (48) with the roller 
(43) assembled thereon through the first end (16) of 

the body (14).  
 
A roller valve lifter as claimed in 

claim 1, wherein the discontinuities comprise openings 
(58,60) through the skirt (39) adjacent the outer ends 

(52) of the bearing shaft (48). 
A roller valve lifter as claimed in 
claim 2, wherein the through openings are round (58) 

or are elongated slots (60). 
A roller valve lifter as claimed in any 
one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the opposed ends of the  

 
bearing shaft (48) each define an integral tang (51) 

having an outer end (52) and laterally opposed 
flattened sides (54), the tangs fitting closely within 

extensions (55) of the recess (42) having lateral 
abutments (56) opposing the flattened sides of the 

tangs to locate the bearing shaft in the recess; and 
wherein the retaining means retains the bearing shaft 

in the extensions. 
A roller valve lifter as claimed in 
claim 4, wherein the bearing shaft (48) is formed of a 

deformable material, the outer ends (52) having 
portions deformed after installation in the 

cylindrical body (14) into engagement with edges of 
the discontinuities (58,60) to retain the bearing 

shaft and roller (43) in their installed locations in 
the extensions (55). 
A roller valve lifter as claimed in 
claim 5, wherein the bearing shaft (39) is made of 

bronze.

one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the roller valve lifter 

comprises a hydraulic valve lifter. 
A roller valve lifter as claimed in any 
one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the diametrical ratio 

of the cylindrical journal (50) to the cylindrical 
outer surface (40) of the skirt (39) is not less than 

0.5. 
A roller valve lifter as claimed in any 
one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the diametrical ratio of 

the cylindrical journal (50) to the round outer 
surface (44) of the roller (43) is not less than 0.6.
