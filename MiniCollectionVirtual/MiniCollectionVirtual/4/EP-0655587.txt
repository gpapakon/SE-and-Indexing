<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an air supply device in an air-inlet apparatus for supplying spaces with supply air, having an at least partly elastic shut-off element which is arranged in the flow duct transversely to the flow direction and is fixed in such a way that it is deformed under the effect of the supply-air flow and reduces the free flow cross-section within the flow duct when the pressure difference between the space to be ventilated and the external environment of the space is increased. An additional device (2, 2') for changing the free flow cross-section within the flow duct (5) independently of the prevailing differential pressure is provided, said additional device having a connection to the at least partially elastic shut-off element (3, 3').

An air supply device (1) which is to be fitted in a wall opening for
the ventilation of a room, comprising a shut-off element (3"; 108) which is

provided in the flow passage transversely with respect to the direction of
flow of the feed air (6) and which has at least one elastic region and which

on the feed air side has a surface which is exposed to the wind pressure
and the projection of which on to the cross-sectional plane of the flow

passage is increased with increasing wind pressure, wherein the elastic
region is increasingly biased from a relaxed position, producing a

corresponding return force, and the free opening cross-section of an
opening adjacent to the shut-off element (3"; 108) within the flow passage

(5) is reduced for the purposes of limiting the volume flow, 
characterised in
that
 connected to the shut-off element (3"; 108) is a three-dimensional
shaped body (10; 109) which with increasing wind pressure with the

movement of the shut-off element (3"; 108) towards the opening at least
partially passes into same and increasingly fills the cross-section thereof.
An air supply device according to claim 1 
characterised in that
 the
shut-off element (3") is in the form of a flap mounted on a flexible band

(3').
An air supply device according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised
in that
 the shaped body (10; 109) extends over the width of the flow
passage and is of a cross-section which is substantially in the form of a

segment of a circle.
An air supply device according to one of the preceding claims

characterised in that
 the shut-off element (3"; 108) with the shaped body
(10; 109) hangs vertically in the flow passage (5) when there is no wind 

pressure and pivots towards the horizontal with an increasing wind
pressure.
An air supply device according to one of the preceding claims

characterised in that
 the elastic region (3') produces a progressive return
force with increasing movement of the shut-off element (3") towards the

opening, wherein in particular the return force of the shut-off element (3")
is substantially greater than the corresponding action of the force of

gravity.
An air supply device according to one of the preceding claims

characterised in that
 the plane of the largest opening cross-section is
inclined relative to the perpendicular and the shut-off element (3"; 108) is

angled in such a way that in the closed position it assumes a position of
substantially covering the cross-section of the opening.
An air supply device according to one of the preceding claims

characterised in that
 mounted at the free end of the shaped body (10) is a
sealing lip (9) which extends over the entire length thereof.
An air supply device according to one of the preceding claims

characterised in that
 the shaped body (10; 109) respectively fills the
opening in such a way that the remaining free cross-section thereof is of

such a dimension that the volume flow (6) passing the free cross-section of
the opening at the wind pressure which produces the corresponding

position of the shut-off element (3"; 108) is substantially constant.
