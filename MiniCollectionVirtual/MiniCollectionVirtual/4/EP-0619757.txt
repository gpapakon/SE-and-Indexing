<DESCRIPTION>
The invention disclosed in WO-A-92/11921
relates to a particulate filter, regenerable by back-flushing,
formed from a porous, honeycomb monolith structure
with selectively plugged passageways and a microporous
membrane coating applied to the passageway surfaces.
The present application further includes a catalyst
coating within or on the filter, which becomes a catalytic
filter, capable of reacting constituents in the filtrate
fluid as it passes through the filter.There are many heterogeneous catalysts and catalyst
devices which are used to carry out a great number of
chemical reactions. In the use of heterogeneous catalysis,
the reaction rate for a catalyst device can be limited by
the rate of bulk mass transfer of reactants to the catalyst
surface or by the rate of pore diffusion of reactants within
the pore structure of porous heterogeneous catalysts. Such
limitations are widely described in the technical
literature, for example in the books The Role of Diffusion
in Catalysis, by C. N. Satterfield and T. K. Sherwood,
published by Addison-Wesley Publishing Company (1963) and
Heterogeneous Catalysis in Practice, by C. N. Satterfiled,
published by McGraw-Hill Book Company (1980). The
engineering design of heterogeneous catalytic reactors is
frequently based on these limitations. New catalyst
configurations which can reduce or perhaps even eliminate
such mass transfer limitations would have substantial
practical value.In the field of catalytic filters, there are various
devices which can simultaneously remove particulate matter 
and a catalyze a reaction in the fluid being filtered. For
example, G. F. Weber et al, at the Energy and Environmental
Research Center at the University of North Dakota have
developed catalyst-coated fabrics suitable for filtration of
coal combustion flue gas for particulate removal with
simultaneous reduction of oxides of nitrogen contained in
the flue gas ("Simultaneous NOX and Particulate Control
Using A Catalyst-Coated Fabric Filter", American Society of
Mechanical Engineers Paper 91-JPGC-FACT-2, presented at the
International Power Generation Conference, October 6-10,
1991, San Diego, California). This device consist of
fiberglass fabrics which are coated with vanadium oxide
catalysts, which in the presence of added ammonia,
efficiently remove particulates as a filter and reduce the
oxides of nitrogen in the gas flowing through the fabric
filter. This latter process is called selective catalytic
reduction (SCR).Similar fabric filter devices are disclosed by E. A
Pirsh in
