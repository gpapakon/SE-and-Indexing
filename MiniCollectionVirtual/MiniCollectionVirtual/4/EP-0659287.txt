<ABSTRACT>
In order to transfer an image on a photocopy to a copying material, the invention calls for a transfer sheet to be laid on the photocopy and a negative of the image to be produced using heat and pressure. The transfer sheet representing the negative is then laid on a copying material which has a photosensitive layer which is exposed by illuminating it through the transfer sheet. In this way, stamps or other equipment for use in printing textile material can be produced without the need for complex apparatus.

A method for transfer of an image pattern formed 
on a master material (10) onto a copying material 

(12,12a,12b), wherein a negative transparent 
image corresponding to the image pattern of the 

master material (10) is produced and is used for 
exposing therethrough a photosensitive reaction 

layer (17,21) which then is further processed by 
removing material of the non-exposed regions of 

said layer,
characterized in
 
that the transparent image is generated by means 

of a transfer film (13) which is laid over the 
master material (10) provided as a photocopy, 

wherein those regions of the master material 
(10) which have toner arranged thereon become 

attached by pressure and heat to a light-retaining 
transfer layer (15a) of the transfer film 

(13) and remove the light-retaining transfer 
layer (15a) from a transparent carrier material 

(14) of the transfer film.  
 
The method according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the copying material (12a,12b) comprises 

a carrier (16) coated with a reaction layer 
(21), that the reaction layer (21) includes a 

hot-melt adhesive or is coated therewith, and 
that those regions of the reaction layer which 

remain after exposure of the reaction layer (21) 
and removal of material from the non-exposed 

regions, are transferred by pressure and heat 
onto a substrate (20). 
The method according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the substrate (20) is a textile material. 
The method according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the copying material (12b) is used for 

exposure of a photosensitive reaction layer (26) 
of a screen (24) to render the screen (24) impermeable 

to colorants in selective regions, and 
that the screen (24) is used in a screen printing 

process. 
A method for transfer of an image pattern formed 
on a master material onto a copying material, 

comprising the following steps: 

a) by photocopying onto a transparent material, 
producing a transparent image corresponding  

 
to the image pattern of the master material, 
b) attaching the toner regions of the transparent 
material by pressure and heat to the 

transfer layer of a transfer film, 
c) exposing a photosensitive reaction layer 
through the transparent image, 
d) further processing the photosensitive reaction 
layer by removing material of the non-exposed 

regions of said layer.
