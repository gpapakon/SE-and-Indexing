<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns herbicidal compositions based on industrial sulphonyl carbamides and used to control unwanted vegetation by treating both the vegetation itself and the soil in which it grows. In order to counteract the adverse effects on crop rotation and the phytotoxic effect on crop plants, it is proposed that, in order to reduce standard doses and broaden the spectrum of action of the herbicides used, the composition used should be a mixture of the following: diethylethanol ammonium salts, 1-(2-chlorobenzene sulphonyl)-3-(4-isopropylideniminoxy-6-dimethylamino-1,3,5-triazin-2-y l)-carbamide and 1-(2-substituted benzene sulphonyl)-3-(4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2-yl)-carbamide, a surface active agent, an organic solvent and water.
