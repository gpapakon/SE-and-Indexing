<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an olefin-polymerizing
catalyst capable of forming in one
polymerization system two homopolyolefins, each of said
homopolyolefins being an isotactic polyolefin in which
the disorder of monomer units alignment is in respective
specified range. The present invention further relates
to a process for producing an olefin polymer which is useful for production of a biaxially oriented
film using said
catalyst.
More particularly, the present invention relates
to a process for producing an olefin polymer excellent
in stiffness and stretchability and successfully usable
for formation of films, fibers, blow-molded articles,
extrusion-molded articles, etc., an olefin-polymerizing
catalyst used for production of such a polymer.Biaxially oriented films are extensively used 
as packaging materials because of their excellence in
transparency, gloss, stiffness and water vapor barrier
property. With the aim of improving the film
properties, such as stiffness, of biaxially oriented
film, highly crystalline homopolymers of propylene
obtained with a high-stereospecificity catalyst have
conventionally been used. However, such highly
crystalline homopolymers of propylene have a fault that
they are inferior in stretchability and apt to make
troubles such as film breaking in the course of
stretching. Thus, a variety of methods have so far been
proposed for improving the stretchability of highly
crystalline polypropylene. As one example of such
proposals, copolymerization of propylene with a small
amount of ethylene is known. Concretely speaking, JP-B-46-11027
has proposed a process for producing a
polypropylene for use in production of films which
comprises polymerizing propylene together with a very
small amount of ethylene in the presence of a
coordination catalyst and a hydrocarbon, hydrogen
chloride or chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent so that one
mole of the monomer unit in the resulting polymer
becomes containing 0.01 mole or less of ethylene unit.
Further, in JP-B-64-6211, there is proposed a process
for producing a polypropylene improved in stretchability
which comprises feeding propylene together with a small
amount of ethylene into polymerization system using a
catalyst consisting of an organoaluminum compound and 
titanium trichloride prepared by reducing titanium
tetrachloride with an organoaluminum compound and
further activating the reduced product by a treatment
using a complex-forming agent, a treatment using an
organoaluminum compound, a treatment using titanium
tetrachloride or a
