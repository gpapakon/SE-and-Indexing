<ABSTRACT>
A temperature-controlled three-way mixing valve comprises a valve housing (10) which forms a mixing chamber (12), with a hot-water connection, a cold-water connection and an outlet connection for mixed water, a temperature sensor (32) responding to the temperature of the mixing chamber, and control valve means (26) which are controlled by the temperature sensor (32), by means of which the cross-sections of flow between the hot-water connection and the mixing chamber (12) and between the cold-water connection and the mixing chamber (12) can be varied in an opposite sense as the temperature in the mixing chamber increases. The temperature-controlled three-way mixing valve furthermore comprises an auxiliary valve (70) which can be controlled by the cold-water inflow and by means of which the connection between the hot-water connection and the mixing chamber (12) can be shut off with little delay if the cold-water inflow ceases.
