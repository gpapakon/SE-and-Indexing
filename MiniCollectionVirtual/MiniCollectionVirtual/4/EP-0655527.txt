<ABSTRACT>
Ink for ink-jet dyeing purposes contains a disperse dye 
which is insoluble, or slightly soluble, in water, and a 

dispersing agent which can be represented by the following 
general formula (I).



M - (-OCH₂CH₂-)
n
 - X-(-CH₂CH₂O-)
n
 - M



 
   Here, X in this formula represents -A- or -O-A-O- (where 

A is represented by the formulae indicated below), and M is a 
hydrogen atom, -SO₃H, -SO₃NH₄ or -SO₃Na, and n is an integer 

of value 5 - 20.
 

(where A is) 

   According to the above ink, there is no blockage of the 
orifices by the ink and the ink can be discharged from the 

orifices in the form of very fine liquid droplets which are 
stable, and mixing of the inks which have be discharged on the 

surface of the said cloth proceeds smoothly, thereby enabling 
to obtain uniform and distinct images with no physical defects 

or colour defects. 
Another aspect is directed to a method of forming mixing 
colour on a material to be dyed. According to this method, 

the mixing colour is obtained by mixing a first ink for ink-jet 
dyeing with a second ink for ink-jet dyeing having a 

colour which is different from that of the first ink on the 
material to be dyed, wherein the first and second inks contain 

water, dispersing dye which is insoluble or slightly soluble 
in water and dispersing agent which can be represented by the 

above general formula (I).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ink for ink-Jet dyeing and,
more particularly to ink for ink-Jet dyeing purposes in which
a specified dispersing agent is used as a dispersing agent for
a disperse dye which is insoluble or slightly soluble in water
and method of forming mixing colour by using the ink.Ink-Jet dyeing has been adopted as a means of dyeing
cloth in recent years.Ink-jet dyeing is a technique in which dyeing is achieved
by dispersing very fine liquid droplets of dye ink onto the
cloth surface from a discharge orifice; printing points, lines
or patterns, for example, onto the cloth surface; then, after
printing, colouring and fixing the discharged dye by drying or
heating with moist heat; and finally removing the unfixed dye.The best dye inks for use in ink-jet printing are
selected according to the material which is to be dyed.Recently, there is a very great demand for products made
of the polyester and polyacetate materials. For dyeing these
materials, dye inks in which disperse dyes are used are mainly
employed.Disperse dyes, apart from those which are used by being
solved in organic solvents, are generally used in the form of
a dispersion in which water is used as the principal medium.In those cases where a cloth is dyed using such dye ink
in which a disperse dye which uses water as the principal
medium is employed, there is a disadvantage in that blockage
of the discharge orifice, that is to say the nozzle, is liable
to occur.Such nozzle blockage results in the discharge of very
fine liquid droplets which are being scattered unevenly when
printing on the cloth, thus leading to a troublesome fault
when producing products. Furthermore, since the nozzle 
blockage also reduces productivity, it must be avoided.Since such blockage is greatly affected by the stability
of the dye ink, it is important that a fairly stable dye ink
should be used.The three conditions of stable particle size, suitable
viscosity and a high degree of dispersion must be satisfied in
order to secure stability for dye ink.However, no ink which satisfies satisfactorily such
conditions and contains disperse dye which uses water as the
principal medium has yet been developed.On the other hand, in those cases where a cloth is dyed
with a dye ink in which a disperse dye which uses water as the
principal medium is used, there is a case that so considerably
bleeding occurs in the warp direction, the weft direction and
the thickness direction of the cloth, thus resulting in
difficulty in obtaining a sharp pattern. This is because in
the
