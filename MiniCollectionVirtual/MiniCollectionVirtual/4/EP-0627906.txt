<ABSTRACT>
A blister pack for tablets or capsules having a flexible plastic sheet (1) thermoformed to define a plurality of open faced pockets (2) each pocket being shaped to receive an individual tablet or capsule, the open faces of the pockets being closed by a sheet of aluminium foil heat sealed to the plastic sheet, characterised in that hinge means (5) are provided across the pack on a line about which the pack is substantially symmetrical, the two halves ot the pack on either side of the hinge being adapted to be folded together with the area of aluminium foil of each said halves overlying the other whereby the aluminium foil is protected from accidental damage that might be caused by contact with a hard object, resealable fastening means (6, 7) being provided to maintain the pack in a folded configuration.

<DESCRIPTION>
Blister packs are now widely used for medicinal and food
supplement tablets and capsules, whereby these tablets or capsules
are contained between a normally transparent, flexible plastic sheet,
thermoformed so as to define a plurality of pockets, with each pocket
being just large enough to receive the shape of the individual tablet
or capsule, and a flat aluminium foil, heat sealed to said plastic sheet.The main advantage of this type of packaging is the
extended shelf life, due to protection against oxygen and humidity,
that it provides for these medicinal tablets and capsules, compared to
conventional packaging in bottles and containers. With blister
packaging, the tablet or capsule does not get exposed to external air
and humidity until such time that the aluminium foil is broken. The
aluminium foil is not supposed to be broken until just prior to the user
ingesting the tablet or capsule.In the case of conventional bottles and containers, all of the
tablets or capsules inside that bottle or container are exposed to
external air and humidity every time that the cap is taken off in order to
take out just one of these tablets or capsules.The second advantage of blister packs is the convenience to
the user of being able to carry around in his or her pocket or handbag
just one flat and light blister card of tablets instead of having to carry
the whole bulky and heavy bottle. The need to carry tablets on one's
person applies to many tablets, such as headache, anti-histamine,
contraceptive, antacid, anti-inflammatory and heart tablets etc.Whilst such blister packs provide a level of convenience and
security to the user over loose tablets or capsules, in presenting a
controlled dosage regime to encourage patient compliance,
conventional pack formats have generally proved somewhat inflexible
in adapting to variations in dosages between patients and have
remained vulnerable to accidental damage and contents discharge.
There have been pack proposals addressing these issues
individually.Thus, GB-A-2 223 741 is concerned with a tablet pack for 
dispensing variable dosages, by employing a matrix of tablet
receptacles on a carrier, with markings dividing the receptacles into
different daily dosage groups - enabling selectively variable tablet
dosage dispensation from a common pack format.US Serial No: 4,120,400 teaches a pill package with certain
child-proof features, using a standard blister card mounting for pills. A
plastic shield is slidably mated with the blister card to enable selective
interlocking of card
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A blister pack (1) for tablets or capsules, impervious to
humidity and oxygen, the pack comprising a flexible plastic sheet

thermoformed to define a plurality of open faced pockets (2) each
pocket being shaped to receive an individual tablet or capsule (3), the

open faces of the pockets being closed by a sheet of aluminium foil
(4) heat sealed to the plastic sheet, hinge means (5) provided across

the pack on a line about which the pack is substantially symmetrical,
the two halves of the pack movable about the hinge between an

open configuration in which a tablet or capsule (3) can be removed
from the pack and a closed configuration in which the area of

aluminium foil (4) of each of said halves faces the other whereby the
aluminium foil (4) is protected from accidental damage, removal of a

tablet or capsule (3) being possible only when the pack is in the open
configuration, and resealable integrally formed fastening means

provided to maintain the pack in the closed configuration, and the
hinge means and releasable integrally formed fastening means are

constructed and arranged to allow repeated opening and closing of
the pack characterised in that the hinge means (5) consists of a

thermoformed hinge groove with cuts extending parallel and directly
adjacent to both sides of the groove, the depth of the groove and the

lengths of the cuts being selected in relation to the characteristics of
the sheet so that when the sheet is folded about the hinge, parts

thereof on either side of the hinge will fold through 90Â° to lie flat
against one another.
A blister pack as claimed in claim 1 wherein the said
resealable integrally formed fastening means (6 and 7) consists in

protrusion from one half of the sheet arranged to engage frictionally
within cavities formed in the other half when the card is folded to

maintain the card in a folded condition.
A blister pack as claimed in claim 1 wherein the said
resealable fastening means (10 and 11) consists in cuts formed in the

card constructed and arranged so that the edges thereof interlock
when the card is folded to maintain the card in a folded condition. 
A blister pack as claimed in claim 1 wherein the said
resealable means is not an integral part of said plastic sheet.
