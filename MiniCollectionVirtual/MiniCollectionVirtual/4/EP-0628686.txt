<ABSTRACT>
A hinge for a refrigerator or freezer is provided with a hinge arm (1) which is guided in a rectilinear manner in a guide (3), which can be fastened on a main-body part (5) and on which a pivot pin (8) of a door (9) is articulated. In order to provide a hinge of high load-bearing capacity, of a long service life and with a large opening angle, of which the articulation, upon opening, carries out a rectilinear swing-out movement and correspondingly, on closure, carries out a rectilinear swing-in movement, the pivotable part is connected, by a lever/link gearing mechanism (14, 16, 20), to the guides (3) or to the main-body part (5) such that, by pivoting the pivotable part (9, 11) in the opening direction, a swing-out movement is imparted to the hinge arm (1).
