<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to preventing an amount of coating from being locally increased at the end of an 
area being coated, and making a thickness of coating precisely constant over the entire area being coated. A spacing 

between a D roller (4) and a C roller (1) is switched in two steps, large and small, at suitable time intervals. A thick 
coating layer (6a) on the C roller (1), controlled when a spacing between the D roller (4) and the C roller (1) is large, is 

transferred and applied to a backing sheet (3) in a state, in which a B roller (2) and the C roller (1) contact each other 
through the backing sheet (3). A spacing between the B roller (2) and the C roller (1) is enlarged in synchronization 

with thin coating layer (6c) on the C roller (1), which is controlled when a spacing between the D roller (4) and the C 
roller (1) is small, reaching a position of transfer, so that the coating is prevented from being transferred and applied 

to the backing sheet (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and an apparatus
for coating a slurry coating material onto a continuous base
sheet at a given thickness, and particularly to a process and an
apparatus for intermittently coating a slurry coating material
to alternately form a coated area and an uncoated area, each
having a predetermined length on a base sheet.In mass production of, for example, a spiral electrode type
lithium battery, a following intermittent coating technique is
required. A band-shaped hoop material of a copper or an aluminum
foil serving as a current collector of a battery is used as the
base sheet, and a slurry mixture containing an electrode active
substance as a main component is used as the coating material.
The coating material is applied to the base sheet, for example,
over an area having a length of 30 cm at a given thickness in
such a manner that the coating material is not applied at all to
a subsequent area having a length of 5 cm, thereby alternately
forming a coated area having a predetermined length and an
uncoated area having a predetermined length on the continuous
base sheet.The most typical process used to carry out such an
intermittent coating employs a coating device referred to as a
reverse roll coater as shown in Fig.7. Referring to Fig. 7, a coating roll 1 (hereinafter referred
to as a C-roll) is rotated at a predetermined speed in a
direction indicated by an arrow a. A backing roll 2 (hereinafter
referred to as a B-roll) is in contact with the C-roll 1 with a
base sheet 3 interposed therebetween and is rotated in a
direction opposite from the direction of rotation of the C-roll
1 (i.e., in a direction indicated by an arrow b). The base sheet
3 is allowed to travel in a direction indicated by an arrow c
along the B-roll 2 and to pass between the C-roll 1 and the
B-roll 2.An adjuster referred to as a doctor roll 4 (hereinafter
referred to as a D-roll) is fixedly (i.e., non-rotatably) mounted
above the C-roll 1 at a predetermined distance spaced apart from
the C-roll 1. A coating material 6 accumulated in a hopper 5 is
deposited onto a peripheral surface of the C-roll 1 to pass
through a region of a minimum distance between the C-roll 1 and
the D-roll 4, whereby the amount of coating material 6 applied
to the base sheet 3 is controlled to a value (thickness)
corresponding to such distance.A coating layer 6a controlled to the predetermined thickness
by the distance between the C-roll 1 and the D-roll 4 is
transferred onto the base sheet 3 when the base sheet 3 is passed
be

An intermittent coating process, comprising the steps of:

depositing a slurry coating material (6) onto a coating roll
