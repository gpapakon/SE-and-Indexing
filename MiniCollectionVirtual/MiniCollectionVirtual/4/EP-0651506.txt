<ABSTRACT>
The comparator contains an inverter having a first depletion FET (3) and a first enhancement FET (4) and a series circuit of a second depletion FET (1) and a second enhancement FET (2). All FETs are of the same channel type. The node (10) between the second enhancement FET and the second depletion FET is connected to the gate terminal of the first enhancement FET. The voltage (Ue) to be compared is applied between the second enhancement FET and earth. The transfer characteristic (Ugs/ID) of the second enhancement FET (2) is steeper than that of the first enhancement FET (4). The switching point (S) is determined by matching the transfer characteristics of the two enhancement FETs.
