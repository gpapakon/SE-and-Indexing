<ABSTRACT>
A process and an apparatus for an aerobic 
biological treatment of aqueous organic wastes, in 

which the aqueous organic waste is supplied to the 
aeration tank for an aerobic biological treatment in 

the presence of a biosludge composed essentially of 
aerobic microorganisms, the aerated aqueous suspension 

in the aeration tank (11) is subjected to solid/liquid 
separation, the so-separated liquid phase is exhausted 

as the treated water, at least a portion of the 
separated sludge is recycled (20,14) to the aeration tank (11), a 

part of the aqueous suspension in the aeration tank (33) or 
of the separated sludge is treated with ozone (31) at a pH 

of 5 or lower, and the ozonized suspension or sludge is 
recycled (37) to the step of aerobic biological treatment, 

whereby the biosludge is transformed into BOD 
components using a decreased amount of ozone to thereby 

decrease the amount of excess sludge and, in some 
cases, even to zero.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process
for an aerobic biological treatment of aqueous organic
wastes in an aeration tank in the presence of a
biosludge.An aerobic biological treatment of aqueous
wastes by biodegradation of the organic substances in
the waste using aerobic microorganisms, such as the
so-called activated sludge treatment, permits a low
cost running with a superior treatment performance and
has found a wide use. It suffers, however, from a
problem of occurrence of a large amount of "excess
sludge" formed in accompaniment with such an aerobic
biological treatment, which is difficult to be
dewatered up to a degree permitting easy disposal or
further processing thereof. The excess sludge formed
during the biological treatment may amount to about 30
- 60 % by weight of the biolyzed biological oxygen demand (BOD) in the treated 
waste, so that the disposal thereof brings about a
practical problem. Heretofore, such an excess sludge
has been disposed by depositing it in a landfill. In
practice, it becomes more and more difficult to reserve
such a landfill site, so that it is required to develop
a technique for reducing the amount of the excess
sludge to be formed.To achieve such a reduction of excess sludge
formation, it has generally been practiced to employ a
biological digestion of the excess sludge formed in a
conventional aerobic biological treatment of aqueous
wastes, either in an aerobic or an anaerobic condition.
This is acomplished by installing a biosludge digestion
unit separately from the aerobic biological treatment
apparatus for aqueous organic waste, in which digestion
of the biosludge is effected under an aerobic or
anaerobic condition.Such a practice provides a decomposition of
the biosludge only up to a proportion of about 50 %
thereof, with the remainder of about 50 % being
discharged out of the system as the so-called "digested
sludge" which is impervious to biological attack and
should be disposed by incineration or deposition.In Japanese Patent Application Kokai Nos.

a technique for treating an excess sludge by first
subjecting it to an oxidative decomposition by ozone
and, then, biologically digesting the remaining sludge
under an aerobic or anaerobic condition is disclosed
and it is taught that the performance of reduction of 
the excess sludge amount is increased or the requisite
digestion time can be decreased by the ozone treatment.In these conventional techniques, however, an ozone
treatment is employed for

A process for aerobic biological treatment of aqueous
organic waste, comprising the steps of:


aerating the aqueous organic waste in an aeration tank
(11) in the presence of a biosludge composed essentially of

aerobic microorganisms, to form an aerated aqueous
suspension;
withdrawing aerated aqueous suspension from the
aeration tank and introducing it into a solid/liquid

separation unit (12), to give a separated sludge containing
the biosludge and a separated liquid phase;
recycling at least a portion of the separated sludge to
the aeration tank;
treating with ozone, at a pH of no more than 5, either

aerated aqueous suspension withdrawn from the aeration tank
or a part of the separated sludge; and
recycling either the ozonized suspension or the
ozonized sludge to the aeration tank, for aerobic biological

treatment.
A process according to claim 1, wherein the ozone
treatment step comprises the addition of a pH-controlling

agent.
A process according to claim 1, which further comprises
an acidogenesis step in which the suspension or sludge for

the ozone treatment is subjected to an anaerobic biological
treatment, to adjust the pH thereof to no more than 5.
A process according to any preceding claim, which
further comprises heating the suspension or sludge for the

ozone treatment to between 50 and 100Â°C, before or after the
ozone treatment.
A process according to any preceding claim, wherein the
biosludge in the aeration tank has a VSS/SS ratio maintained

at 0.2-0.7 and a MLVSS value maintained at 500-10000 mg/l.
A process according to any preceding claim, wherein the
solid/liquid separation unit is a membrane separation unit

that gives the separated liquid phase as a permeate and the
separated sludge as a concentrated sludge containing the

biosludge.
