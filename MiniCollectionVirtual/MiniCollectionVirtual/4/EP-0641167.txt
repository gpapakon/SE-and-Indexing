<DESCRIPTION>
As set out in our co-pending European Patent Application
91 30 60 26.5 (filed July 3, 1991), chocolate compositions
containing the conventional ingredients, such as cocoa
powder, cocoa butter, cocoa-butter equivalents, sugar and
emulsifiers, need to be tempered because of the presence of
polymorphic fats, such as POP, POSt and/or StOSt (P =
palmitic acid; St = stearic acid and O = oleic acid).According to the above-mentioned patent application an
improvement in bloom formation is obtained by adding a
minimum amount of a hardstock fat to the chocolate
composition. The hardstock fats used are of the (H2M + M2H)-type,
wherein H = saturated fatty acid having at least 16 C-atoms
and M = saturated fatty acid having C8-C14 atoms,
preferably C12-C14 atoms. Very useful are hardstock fats
obtainable by interesterification of mixtures of vegetable
oils high in triglycerides with fatty acid residues having
at least 16 C-atoms, and triglycerides rich in lauric and/or
myristic acid residues, e.g. as disclosed in our Australian
Patent Application 12346/85 (Serial Number 549,465).Although the results obtained according to the above-mentioned
European Patent Application are, in general, very
satisfactory, in particular upon storage above ambient
temperature, we found that bloom formation still occurred
upon storage at ambient temperature when these hardstock
fats were applied at relatively high levels, i.e. above 1.5
wt.% on product, in particular in dark chocolate
compositions. It has, however, been found that the
prevention of bloom at high temperatures is most effective
when more of the additive is applied. Therefore, we have conducted a study in order to find out
how this problem could be overcome. As a result, we have
found a new blend of triglycerides which upon application in
chocolate compositions, or in chocolate-like compositions,
wherein high amounts of cocoa butter equivalents are
present, or in baked bakery products, provided with a
chocolate layer or a chocolate-like layer, or in chocolate
encapsulated filling led to an improvement of the anti-bloom
behaviour of the chocolate compositions. So our invention
concerns in the first instance novel triglyceride
compositions, comprising triglycerides from the types A
B and C, wherein A is a triglyceride composition of the
(H2M + M2H)-type, as defined above; B is a soft triglyceride
composition, having a relatively high level of (U3 + U2S)-triglycerides
and C is a vegetable fat or a fraction thereof
with an N20 (not stab.) of more than 15.Depending on the typical
