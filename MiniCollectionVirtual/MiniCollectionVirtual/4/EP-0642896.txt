<ABSTRACT>
A saw (10) has a saw assembly (20) pivoted about 
pivot axis (28) to a pivot member (26). The pivot 

member is pivoted to a pivot block (27) about a bevel 
axis (92). The pivot block is fixed to a table (16) 

in a frame (12). Pivoting of the pivot member about 
axis (92) permits bevel cuts to be made in workpieces 

(now shown) supported on the table (16) against fence 
(17) when the assembly (20) (which includes a motor 

driven blade (36)) is pivoted down about the axis. 
Between the pivot block and pivot member is 
disposed a bearing plate (46) which serves several 

functions. It reduces friction and wear between the 
pivot block and member and the need for machining of 

those parts. It serves to hold resiliently the bevel 
pivot axis bearing surfaces (88, 90, 130, 132) in 

position. It provides index notches (61) to locate 
the bevel position of the pivot member relative to 

the pivot block. It provides a rack 50 for a bevel 
position indicating pinion (52) to engage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to chop saws of the type 
comprising a table, a pivot block on the table, a 
pivot member pivotally mounted with respect to the 
table about a first axis (which is the bevel axis of 
the saw) lying in the plane of the table, and a saw 
assembly mounted on the pivot member and including a 
motor driven blade adapted to move in its plane 
(which plane contains said axis) to cut workpieces 
supported on the table. The invention is especially useful, although no 
limited to, saws of the type which have the table 
mounted in a frame so that the table can flip over 
between two positions. In a first position the saw 
is a chop saw with the saw assembly being above the 
table, but in the second position, the saw assembly 
is below the table and the blade is adapted to 
protrude from below through a slot in the table so 
that workpieces supported on the under surface of the 
table (now on top) may be presented to the blade for 
rip sawing and the like. In particular the present invention is concerned 
with the bevel pivot arrangements of such saws. The pivot member is pivotable with respect to the 
table so that the blade can impinge the workpiece at 
any desired angle, usually between 45° and 90°, in 
order to make bevel cuts in the workpiece. Although not directly relevant to the present 
invention, the table may also be in two parts. In 
this event, a rotatable part is received in a fixed 
part and is rotatable with respect to the fixed part  
 
about an axis perpendicular to both the bevel pivot 
axis and the plane of the table. This enables the 
saw, whose saw assembly is mounted on the rotatable 
part of the table, to perform mitre cuts on the 
workpiece, and even compound cuts. The mitre cut 
option is usually only employed when the saw operates 
as a chop saw, it being usual to adjust the position 
of the workpiece, rather than the blade, when mitre 
cuts are to be made when the saw is in a bench saw 
mode. Returning to the bevel pivot arrangement, the 
block may be a part of the table or a separate 
element connected to it. In any event, the pivot 
member and pivot block abut one another and must 
slide against each other. Some form of releasable 
clamping means must be provided to lock the two 
together during cutting operations and to release 
them for pivoting. The connection between them must 
be as accurate as possible in order to ensure that 
the bevel axis remains constant (that is to say, it 
must not be allowed to float) and so that repeatable 
cuts can be made.

<CLAIMS>
A saw comprising a table, a pivot block fixed to 
a first surface of the table, a pivot member 

pivotally mounted with respect to the pivot block 
about a first axis, a saw assembly mounted on the 

pivot member and comprising a motor driven blade 
lying in a plane containing said first axis, the 

blade being adapted to move with respect to said 
pivot member in said plane to cut workpieces 

supported on said first surface of the table, 
characterised in that a bearing plate is disposed 

between said pivot block and pivot member and against 
which one of said pivot block and pivot member bear 

during pivoting of the pivot member with respect to 
the pivot block. 
A saw as claimed in claim 1, in which the pivot 
block and pivot member are cast aluminum and the 

bearing plate is steel. 
A saw as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which the 
bearing plate further comprises an arcuate rack whose 

centre is said first axis and a pinion engages said 
rack and rotates through said engagement on pivoting 

of the pivot member with respect to the pivot block, 
a dial being operatively connected to said pinion to 

indicate the angle of pivot of said pivot member to 
said pivot block. 
A saw as claimed in any preceding claim, in which 
said plate is fixed to the pivot block. 
A saw as claimed in claims 3 and 4, in which said 
pinion is journalled in said pivot member.  

 
A saw as claimed in any preceding claim, in which 
clamping means are provided to clamp said pivot block 

and pivot member together in a desired position. 
A saw as claimed in claim 6, in which said 
clamping means comprises a pin received in one of 

said pivot member and pivot block passing through an 
arcuate 
slot in the other of said pivot member and 
pivot block. 
A saw as claimed in claim 7 when dependent on 
claim 3, in which said pin is received in the pivot 

member and serves as the journal for said pinion, 
said arcuate slot being formed in the pivot block. 
A saw as claimed in any preceding claim, in which 
index notches are formed on the periphery of said 

plate and a pawl member is disposed on one of the 
pivot member and pivot block to engage said notches 

in different selected pivot positions of the pivot 
member with respect to the pivot block so as to 

locate said pivot member and pivot block in one of 
said positions. 
A saw as claimed in any preceding claim, in which 
said pivot member has a projection received in a 

groove in said table, the projection and groove 
having part substantially cylindrical engaging pivot 

surfaces whose axes coincide with said first axis. 
A saw as claimed in claim 10 when dependent on 
claim 4, in which said projection has a second 

opposing part substantially cylindrical pivot 
surface, centred on said first axis, which bears 

against a corresponding surface of said plate.
