<ABSTRACT>
The multi-colour pad printing machine in a turn-table design has an equal number of pads (14) and holders (18) for the workpieces (20). Each holder passes successively through six stations in which the pads each pick up different colours from the intaglio plates. Each workpiece, here plates, is provided with the respective colour successively from the same pad in six stations which are arranged between the inking and scraping devices (38). A high degree of register accuracy is achieved by the direct colour transfer using the same pad, while the combination of this system with the turn-table device allows the production of high numbers.

<CLAIMS>
Colour tampon printing apparatus for printing on 
workpieces along a circular continuous conveying path, 

including at least two tampons (14) and at least two 
colouring and doctoring devices and holders (18) in an 

identical number for receiving said workpieces (20), 
wherein said tampons (14) and said holders (18) are 

disposed in horizontal planes in mutual vertical offset 
and are adapted for turning as a whole about vertical 

axes, and
 
wherein throughout the multi-step printing operation, 

which encompasses several stations, said tampons (14) are 
connected via rigidly interconnected holding arms (12, 16) 

so as to be prevented from rotation, with each of the 
centre axes of said tampons (14) and of said holders (18) 

being located on a common vertical centre axis (A) and 
with the stations for printing on said workpieces (20) 

being disposed adjacent to or between said colouring or 
doctoring devices (38).
