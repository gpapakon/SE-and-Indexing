N-benzylpiperazine compounds of formula I :


wherein R represents :

1) a hydrogen atom, or
2) a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical containing
from 1 to 20 carbon atoms which is optionally

mono- or poly-substituted by :

a- a cycloalkyl radical having from 3 to 7 carbon
atoms optionally substituted by a phenyl

radical which is itself optionally substituted
by one or more halogen atoms or alkyl or alkoxy

radicals each having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms,
b- a phenyl radical itself optionally substituted
by one or more halogen atoms or alkyl or alkoxy

radicals each having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms,
or
c- an OR
1
 radical in which R
1
 represents :

a hydrogen atom, or
a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical
containing from 1 to 5 carbon atoms;

with the proviso that R is other than the di(4-fluorophenyl)methyl
group,

and also the physiologically tolerable addition salts
thereof with appropriate acids.
N-ethyl-N'-(2-hydroxy-3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-piperazine 
and its dihydrochloride.
N-(7-hydroxyoctyl)-N'-(2-hydroxy-3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-piperazine
and its dihydrochloride.
E-N-[(2-phenylcyclopropyl)methyl]-N'-(2-hydroxy-3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-piperazine

and its dihydrochloride.
N-(2-hydroxy-3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-piperazine and its
dihydrochloride.
A process for the preparation of compounds of claim 1,
characterised in that :


in the case where R represents a hydrogen atom, N-benzyl
N'-(2-hydroxy-3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-piperazine is

debenzylated by means of hydrogen in the presence of a
catalyst; and
in the case where R has one of the meanings given in
claim 1 other than hydrogen, a compound of formula II:



wherein R' represents :

a- a hydrogen atom;
b- a phenyl radical optionally substituted by one or
more halogen atoms or by one or more alkyl or alkoxy

radicals each having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms;
c- a cycloalkyl radical having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms
optionally substituted by a phenyl radical which is

itself optionally substituted by one or more
halogen atoms or by one or more alkyl or alkoxy

radicals each having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms; or
d- a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical containing 
from 1 to 19 carbon atoms which is optionally

mono- or poly-substituted by :

α- a cycloalkyl radical having from 3 to 7 carbon
atoms optionally substituted by a phenyl

radical which is itself optionally substituted
by one or more halogen atoms or by one or more

alkyl or alkoxy radicals each having from 1 to 5
carbon atoms;
β- a phenyl radical, itself optionally substituted
by one or more halogen atoms or by one or more

alkyl or alkoxy radicals each having from 1 to 5
carbon atoms; or
τ- a radical selected from the groups of formulae :
-O-COR
3
-, -COOR
3
 and


(wherein R
3
 represents
a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical

containing from 1 to 5 carbon atoms), according
to whether it is desired to prepare a compound

of formula I in which the substituent R contains,
respectively, a



-CH
2
-OH or


group,

is reduced.
Pharmaceutical compositions comprising as active
ingredient at least one compound according to any one of

claims 1 to 5, with one or more appropriate pharmaceutical
excipients.
Pharmaceutical compositions according to claim 7
presented in a form suitable for the treatment of

neuronal disorders resulting from the dysfunctioning of
oxidative metabolism.
