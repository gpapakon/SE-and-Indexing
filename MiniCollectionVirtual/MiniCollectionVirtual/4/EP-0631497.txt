<ABSTRACT>
A shaft for an articulation endoprosthesis has a metallic core (1) and a proximally connected neck part (10), as well as an envelope (2) made of a non-metallic, elastic material that distally surrounds the core (1). Adherence between the core (1) and the envelope (2) is ensured by a form-fit and/or by a frictional connection. The non-metallic material of the envelope (2) has a modulus of elasticity between 500 and 10,000 N/mm
<
2
>
. The envelope (2) is provided with an additional superfical layer (3) made of biocompatible material having a thickness lower than 600  mu m and a higher surface hardness than the envelope (2).
