<ABSTRACT>
A non-human animal characterized by a human airway, the human airway being open-ended. The human airway is characterized by cells derived from the human respiratory system. The non-human animal and the human airway it carries are useful as models of human airways, particularly diseased human airways, for example, human CF airways. They are also useful to predict the efficacy or toxicity of agents and therapies on human airways, particularly on deseased human airways, for example, human CF airways.

<DESCRIPTION>
NON-HUMAN ANIMAL WITH XENOGRAFT OF ON AIRWAY POPULATED BY HUMAN CELLS.This invention was made with government 5 support under Grant number ROl HL49040 awarded by the National Institute of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a non-human animal 0 characterized by a human airway, the airway having open ends, and to the open-ended airway itself. Preferably, the airway is a diseased human airway. More preferably, the airway is a human cystic fibrosis (CF) airway. Most preferably, the non-human animal in 5 accordance with this invention is characterized by a xenograft of an airway populated by cells derived from the proximal or distal airways of a human lung, or mixtures of those cells, the ends of the airway being open to the air. 0 The non-human animal of this invention and the human airway it carries are useful as a model of a human airway and more preferably of a diseased human airway and most preferably of a human CF airway. They are especially useful as models to study the 5 interrelationship and function of various cell types in human airways in general, and more preferably, in cystic fibrosis and other diseased airways and the 

genes and other molecules controlling such function. The invention is also useful as a model of human airways to assay the effect of various agents on human airways, and particularly the efficacy or toxicity of therapeutic and other agents, methods, and compositions, particularly those involved in gene transfer and manipulation, that may be used to treat lung disease, particularly cystic fibrosis, in humans.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION There are many diseases well known to affect human airways. Such diseases include, for example, cancer, cystic fibrosis, emphysema, asthma, tuberculosis and pneumonia. The study of these diseases and their treatment has, however, been hindered by the lack of a predictive animal model for a human airway, and particularly a diseased human airway and more particularly a human CF airway.Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal, inherited disease caused by abnormalities in epithelial cell function. The most morbid and life limiting aspect of cystic fibrosis involves pulmonary manifestations. The primary manifestation appears to be abnormal mucocilliary clearance. CF patients develop thick mucous that is difficult to clear and ultimately leads to obstruction of the airways. In addition, the lungs of CF patients become colonized with staphylococcus and pseudomonas and the patients

 CLAIMS We claim:
1. A non-human animal characterized by a human airway, the human airway being open-ended.
2. The non-human animal of claim 1, wherein the human airway comprises an airway selected from animal, including human, trachea, bronchi or bronchioli repopulated with cells from a human airway.
3. The non-human animal of claim 1 or 2, wherein the human airway is a diseased human airway.
4. The non-human animal of claim 3, wherein the human airway is a CF airway.
5. The non-human animal of claim 1, wherein the animal is a rodent.
6. The non-human animal of claim 5, wherein the animal is a nu/nu mouse.
7. A method for assessing the effect of an agent or therapy on a human airway comprising the steps of: a) introducing the agent into the human airway of a non-human animal characterized by the human airway, the human airway being open-ended, or exposing the human airway to the therapy; and b) determining the effect of the agent or therapy on the function of the human airway or the cells within the human airway.
8. The method of claim 7, wherein the agent is selected from the group consisting of a toxin, a 


therapeutic agent, an environmental agent or an agent capable of effecting gene transfer.
9. The method of claim 7 or 8, wherein the human airway a diseased human airway.
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the diseased human airway is a CF airway.
11. A human airway comprising an airway repopulated with cells from a human airway and being characterized by open-ended tubes ligated to each end of the airway.
12. The human airway of claim 11, wherein the airway is a non-human airway.
13. The human airway of claim 11 or 12, wherein the human airway is a diseased human airway.
14. The human airway of claim 13, wherein the human airway is a human CF airway.
15. A method for producing a human airway comprising the steps of:
(1) denuding an isolated airway of an animal, including human, respiratory system;
(2) seeding the denuded airway with cells from an airway of a human respiratory system;
(3) ligating tubes onto the denuded airway before or after seeding it with the cells;
(4) grafting the resulting seeded airway into a non-human animal while maintaining the tubes open to the air; and 


 (5) incubating the grafted airway to allow the cells to repopulate the airway.
16. The method of claim 15, wherein the cells are from a diseased human airway.
17. The method of claim 15, wherein the cells are from a human CF airway.
