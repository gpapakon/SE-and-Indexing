<ABSTRACT>
[Object] To contain a vehicle lock device having an 

approximately U-shaped fixing portion not to be seen from the 
exterior.

 
[Construction]
 An approximately U-shaped fixing portion 23, 
is disposed within a containing portion 21 formed on a rear 

fender 20 so as to be longer in the longitudinal direction. 

A lock portion 26 longer in the vehicle width direction is 
overlapped on the fixing portion 23 so as to cross it. The 

fixing portion 23 and the lock portion 26 are fixed to a hook 
37 of a cross-plate 36 and stays 38 of seat rails 30 by means 

of a fixture 29. A seat 5 is then mounted on the seat rails 
30. The vehicle device can be thus contained not to be seen 

from the exterior.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a containing structure 
for containing a vehicle lock device in a motor-bicycle, 
which includes an approximately U-shaped fixing portion and a 
lock portion mounted at both ends of the fixing portion for 
free locking. Such a containing structure has been not known yet. In 
addition, there has been known a technique in which a 
flexible lock device such as a wire or chain is removably 
contained in a frame pipe (for example, in Unexamined 
Japanese Patent Publication No. SHO 56-120464). Moreover, 
Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. SHO 58-126270 
discloses a technique in which a U-shaped lock device is 
mounted on a vehicle in the state to be exposed at the time 
being not in use. A vehicle lock device including a non-flexible fixing 
portion with an approximately U-shape and a lock portion has 
a relatively large size, and therefore, it is difficult to 
contain such a vehicle lock device in the state not to be 
seen from the exterior at the time of being not in use. An 
object of the present invention is to solve this problem.  
 The EP-492 742 A1 shows a structure of the preamble of 
claim 1. There, the fixing portion is slidable in a slot 
under the seat, and the lock portion is used to lock the 
fixing portion in its place. The lock portion remains visible 
from the outside. To avoid this disadvantage, the invention provides a 
containing structure in combination with a motor-bicycle, the 
containing structure containing a 
vehicle lock device having a longitudinal, approximately U-shaped 
fixing portion and a lock portion removable mounted at 
both ends of said fixing portion for free locking; said 
containing structure comprising a containing portion provided 
on a rear fender under a seat for containing said fixing 
portion longitudinally in length direction of the vehicle and 
for holding said lock portion in width direction of the 
vehicle, characterized in that said containing portion 
comprises a space for containing both said fixing portion and 
said lock portion therein, the space being exposable by 
removing said seat, in that positioning ribs or walls erect 
into said space of said containing portion for positioning 
said fixing portion and said lock portion with said lock 
portion overlapping and crossing the fixing portion on an 
intermediate portion thereof; and in that a fixing member is 
provided for fixing at least either of said positioned lock 
portion and said positioned fixing portion on the vehicle 
body. According to the present

<CLAIMS>
A containing structure in combination with a motor-bicycle, the 
containing structure containing a vehicle 

lock device having a longitudinal, approximately U-shaped fixing 
portion (23) and a lock portion (26) removable mounted at both 

ends of said fixing portion (23) for free locking;
 
said containing structure comprising a containing portion (21) 

provided on a rear fender (20) under a seat (5) for containing 
said fixing portion (23) longitudinally in length direction of the 

vehicle and for holding said lock portion in width direction of 
the vehicle,
characterized in that
 said containing portion (21) comprises a 
space for containing both said fixing portion (23) and said lock 

portion (26) therein, the space being exposable by removing said 
seat (5),
 
in that positioning ribs (22a, 22b, 22c) or walls (50, 51, 52, 53) 

erect into said space of said containing portion (21) for 
positioning said fixing portion (23) and said lock portion (26) 

with said lock portion (26) overlapping and crossing the fixing 
portion (23) on an intermediate portion thereof; and
 
in that a fixing member (29) is provided for fixing at least 

either of said positioned lock portion (26) and said positioned 
fixing portion (23) on the vehicle body (30, 36, 37, 38).
