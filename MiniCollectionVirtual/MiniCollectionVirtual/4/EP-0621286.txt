Process for the silylation of carbohydrates in 
liquid nitrogen compounds, characterized in that 10 parts 

by weight of carbohydrates are reacted under pressure in 
an autoclave at a temperature of 25 to 150°C with a 

silylating agent of the formula (I) 

 
in at least 1 part by weight of a liquid nitrogen compound 

of the formula (II) 

 
wherein, in the two formulae (I) and (II), the particular 

radicals, independently of one another, are:

a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 6 carbon atoms, an aryl 
group in the form of a phenyl or naphthyl radical, an 

aralkyl group having 7 to 18 carbon atoms, an alkylaryl 
group having 7 to 18 carbon atoms or an O-, S- or N-containing 

heterocyclic group having 2 to 5 carbon atoms. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the reaction is carried out at a temperature of 50 

to 120°C. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the reaction is carried out with substantial 

exclusion of moisture. 
Process according to claim 3, characterized in 
that the exclusion of moisture is achieved by prior 

adequate drying of the reaction partners. 
Process according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that in the formula (II) of 

the nitrogen compound, the radicals R
1
, R
2
 or R
3
 are a  
 

methyl group and/or hydrogen. 
Process according to claim 5, characterized in 
that ammonia is employed as the nitrogen compound of the 

formula (II). 
Process according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that hexamethyldisilazane is 

employed as the silylating agent. 
Process according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that inert solvents are 

additionally employed in the reaction medium. 
Process according to claim 8, characterized in 
that the inert solvents are liquid at a room temperature 

of about 20°C. 
Process according to claim 8 or 9, characterized 
in that n-hexane and/or toluene are employed as the inert 

solvents. 
Process according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that sucrose, starch or 

cellulose are employed as the carbohydrates.
