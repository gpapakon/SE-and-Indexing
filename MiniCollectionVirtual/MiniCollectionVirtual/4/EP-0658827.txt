<ABSTRACT>
Heating element (20) for a device for fixing images developed 
by means of toner (25) on a support (12). The element is 

characterised by a protective layer (33) of wear-resistant material 
based on carbon particles deposited on the said heating element by 

means of growth by the vacuum deposition of carbon ions. The 
said protective layer also results in a reduced coefficient of friction 

between the said heating element and the film for conveying the 
said support across the said fixing unit, thereby increasing the 

working life of the said heating element.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fixing device and a method of fixing 
the image produced, e.g. by an electrophotographic apparatus on a 
support (usually, but not only, a sheet of paper) using a fixing 
device which uses a thick-film heating element and a film of 
heat-resistant material wound in a ring in the form of an endless 
belt for conveying the support across the fixing device, and more 
particularly to a method of increasing the working life of the heating 
element, reducing the friction between the said heating element and 
the belt and decreasing the value of the torque required to slide the 
belt over the surface of the heating element. European Patent No. 372 479 discloses a method of the type 
mentioned hereinabove for fixing the image on a support, in which 
the apparatus is formed by a heating element having a heating 
surface, a base plate for supporting the heating element, a stand for 
housing the said base plate, a film in the form of a belt which is in 
sliding contact with the heating surface and is fed simultaneously 
with the support, with a pressing roller which applies pressure 
between the support, the belt and the heated surface of the heating 
element. In this manner, the toner deposited on the support is 
heated to the fusing point and when it cools remains permanently 
anchored to the said support. However, the sliding operation generates friction between the 
heating surface of the heating element and the belt, this friction 
opposing the movement of the said belt and leading to the gradual 
deterioration of the heating surface.  In order to solve this problem, in the prior art, a protective 
layer of anti-friction material such as glass or ceramics of low 
thickness, e.g. 10 µm, is deposited on the heating surface, but this 
still does not allow for a sufficient working life for the heating 
element which has to be used in systems offering high reliability. A preferred embodiment of this invention uses a material and 
an associated process for depositing it on the heating surface of the 
heating element, which considerably improves the coefficient of 
friction between the belt and the heating surface and reduces the 
abrasion of the latter. This may be achieved by depositing a layer of appropriate 
thickness formed by a layer of amorphous carbon similar to 
diamond (referred to by the acronym DLC, which stands for 
Diamond-Like Carbon) by means of a process for the vacuum 
deposition of carbon ions. This and other features of the invention will be clearer from 
the following
