Electrolytic machine for treating the bottom of an
aquatic medium possessing a certain electric

conductibility and including at least one pair of
electrodes (13, 14, 36, 37) with at least one metal

anode (13, 36) forming a soluble anode, said
electrodes connected to an electric power supply,

characterised in that it comprises confinement
means (12) with an open base delimiting, at

least partially, a volume to be treated above
said bottom, in that these confinement

means contain said electrodes (13, 14 (36, 37)
so as to approximately reconstitute an electrolytic

tank above said bottom, and in that it further
comprises means (22, 72-74) to move on said bottom

the unit including said electrodes and said
confinement means.
Machine according to claim 1, characterised in that
said confinement means comprise at least two

parallel non-conducting lateral walls (26)
extending approximately parallel to a displacement

direction.
Machine according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the outer faces of at least some of the

electrodes are glued to said non-conducting walls.
Machine according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in
that it includes means (18, 29, 32) to limit the

movements of fluids above said lateral walls.
Machine according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that said confinement means

comprise a lateral skirt encompassing a zone to be
treated.
Machine according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that it includes at least one set

of several flat electrodes (13-14, 36-37) opposite 
one another and connected electrically to said

electric power source so as to form an alternate
succession of anodes and cathodes.
Machine according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that it includes at least one

frame (25-30) supporting said electrodes and wheels
(28, 36-37) in contact with said bottom of the

aquatic medium.
Machine according to claim 7, characterised in that
at least certain wheels (36, 37) are constituted by

said electrodes.
Machine according to claim 7 or 8, characterized in
that said wheels are grouped into pairs, each wheel

of a pair being mounted at one extremity of a lever
(44) joined approximately at its middle to a

stanchion (46) borne by said frame.
Machine according to claim 9, characterised in
that said stanchion is mobile and integral with a

damper (60).
Machine according to one of claims 8 to 10,
characterised in that the wheels (36) forming the

electrodes, situated close to the outside of the
frame, are externally coated with a non-conducting

material (36
a
), this coating defining at least in
part said confinement means.
Machine according to one of claims 7 to 11,
characterised in that at least certain wheels are

driving, for example mechanically coupled to at
least one electric motor (74) borne by said frame.
Machine according to one of claims 7 to 12,

characterised in that it is formed of several
frames (50,51,52) disposed with one behind another

and each bearing a set of electrodes and in that 
said frames are joined oscillating around a shaft

(54).
Machine according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that it comprises an air tank (48)

above said electrodes, fitted in a breathing
chamber and able to provide said machine with a

weak negative buoyancy.
Machine according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that it is fitted with means for

unwinding a marking wire or similar element able to
visualize its path on said bottom of the aquatic

medium.
