<ABSTRACT>
A trigger-operated or triggerless scanner reads
symbols with a first scan pattern in a first intended

position of hand-held use. Either scanner may be mounted
on a stand-alone fixture wherein the first scan

pattern is converted to a second, different scan pattern,
again for reading indicia in a second intended position

of workstation use. Various signal processing digitizing
circuits for faithful digital reconstruction of the

symbols are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to a hand-held
laser scanner for scanning and reading coded indicia,
e.g. bar code symbols, 
as well as to triggerless scanners in general.
Furthermore, various digitizer circuits are disclosed for
signal processing.Hand-held laser scanners are well known. See, for
example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,387,297; 4,409,470 and
4,806,742 as being representative of the art. A stand-alone
laser scanning workstation, for example, see U.S.
Pat. No. 4,369,361, having built-in laser, scanning and
sensor components is also known. It is also known to
provide a so-called "dummy" stand or fixture on which a
hand-held laser scanner is optionally supported when not
being held or used by a human operator. Such dummy
stands typically serve mainly as convenient tabletop
mounts or equipment perches to provide ready access of
the scanner to the operator. In some cases, for example,
see U.S. Pat. No. 5,105,070, the dummy stand is useful in
changing the direction of a laser beam emitted by the
supported scanner.Each of the aforementioned hand-held scanners 
utilizes a trigger which, when manually actuated,
initiates scanning and reading of the indicia. It has
recently been proposed to provide a so-called
"triggerless" hand-held laser scanner where, instead of
a manually-operated trigger, the scanner employs an extra
infrared light emitting diode (LED) and complementary
infrared sensor, both mounted in a front end or nose of
the scanner. When the nose is positioned close to a
symbol, light from the LED reflects therefrom and is
detected by the sensor. Additional control circuitry on-board
the scanner turns on the laser and scanning
components in response to such detection in order to
initiate scanning and reading of the symbol.The working range of this triggerless scanner is
therefore limited by the sensing range of the infrared
scanner. A symbol placed beyond the range of the sensor
cannot be scanned because the sensor will not turn on the
laser and scanning components. Moreover, aside from the
additional expense of the infrared LED and sensor, this
triggerless sensing technique can be inconvenient to use.
To read another symbol, or to read the same symbol again,
the scanner must be moved away from the symbol beyond the
sensing range (e.g. about 15 cm) and then returned to be 
again positioned within sensing range. This can require
large, tiring hand motions. In addition, the triggerless
scanner is subject to many false reading attempts since
any object positioned near the nose will turn the scanner
on

A triggerless reader (10) for electro-optically reading coded indicia (100)
within a limited working range of distances relative to the reader (10),

comprising:

(a) a housing (11, 12) having an interior and an exit window (14);
(b) a light source (33) in the housing (11, 12) for emitting and directing a
light beam along an optical path (21a, 21c) through the window (14) toward

indicia (100) to be read;
(c) scanner means (19, 24) in the housing (11, 12) for scanning the light

beam to have a beam waist having a minimum beam cross-section in a
direction corresponding to the scan direction,
characterized in that
 said beam waist (d

) is located within said interior of the
housing (11, 12), said beam waist being positioned in the optical path (21a)

between the light source (33) and the window (14) to limit the working range
by virtue of the distance traversed by the light beam within the housing (11,

12).

control means (160) for continuously operating at least one of the light source

(33) and the scanner means (19, 24).

means (160) for intermittently operating at least one of the light source (33)

and the scanner means (19, 24).

(c) focusing the light beam to have a beam waist located within said
interior of the housing, said beam waist having a minimum beam cross-section

as considered along in a direction corresponding to the scan direction, said working range being
