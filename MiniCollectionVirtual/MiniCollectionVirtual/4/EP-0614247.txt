<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed an electric wire joining method wherein, for connecting 
a crimp terminal (10) to electric wires (11, 12), invading projections (10b, 10c) 

of the crimp terminal (10) break through insulative coating portions (11a, 12a) 
of the electric wires (11, 12) into contact with core wire portions (11b, 12b) of 

the electric wires (11, 12), and the invading projections (10b, 10c) are 
ultrasonically welded to the core wire portions (11b, 12b) of the electric wires. 

The electric wire joining method necessitates no stripping process of the 
insulative coating portions (11a, 12a) from the electric wires (11, 12) but 

provides stable electrical connection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric wire joining method for joining
two electric wires together or joining an electric wire and a connecting terminal
in an electrical wiring circuit, for example in a wiring harness, for industrial
machinery and vehicles such as automotive vehicles, ships, and aircraft.In the past, a mechanical crimping method has generally been used for
joining electric wires together or joining an electric wire and a connecting
terminal in a wiring harness.For joining an electric wire 1 and an electric wire 2, for example, as
shown in Figs. 8 and 9, the electric wires 1 and 2 are stripped of their
insulative coating portions 1a and 2a at the joint to expose their core wire
portions 1b and 2b, respectively (coating stripping process step). The exposed
core wire portions 1b and 2b are held together in an embraced manner by a
crimp terminal 4 made of sheet metal such as copper or copper alloy and
pressurized to be joined together by crimping (crimping process step). The
electric wires 1 and 2 are electrically connected to each other in this manner.Likewise, for joining an electric wire and a connecting terminal, the electric
wire is stripped of its insulative coating portion at one end to expose its core
wire portion (coating stripping process step). The exposed core wire portion is 
embraced by a crimp portion of the connecting terminal
made of copper or copper alloy. Pressure is applied to the
joint to join the crimp portion and the core wire portion
by crimping (crimping process step). The electric wire and
the connecting terminal are electrically connected to each
other in this manner.However, recent pronounced increase in the number of
circuits for a wiring harness has added to the complexity
of the stripping of the insulative coating portion from the
electric wire in the assembling step of the wiring harness,
resulting in troublesome operation. In particular, it is
troublesome and difficult to strip the insulative coating
portion from an intermediate portion of the electric wire.Furthermore, an electric wire joining technique is
known from FR-A-2 040 720 which serves for mechanically and
electrically connecting a plurality of electric wires each
having a core wire portion and insulative coating portion.
The connecting is provided by means of a crimp terminal
having a plurality of invading projections which, when
crimping said crimp terminal around the electric wires to
be connected, break through said insulative coating
portions of the wires and penetrate into the core
