<ABSTRACT>
A process and an apparatus for producing 
terephthalic acid economically by oxidizing paraxylene 

supplied to an oxidizing reactor connected with a 
compactly designed distillation column in an acetic 

acid-based solvent, while effecting the distillatory 
recovery of the paraxylene and acetic acid efficiently 

without suffering from stuffing of the distillation 
column, which process comprises

 
   supplying paraxylene and a molecular oxygen-containing 

gas to the oxidizing reactor connected to a 
distillation column having at the lower part thereof a 

solid matter collecting tray consisting of a perforated 
ripple plate and, above it, a packed bed and further, 

above it, a liquid distribution tray, in order to cause 
oxidation of the pa
raxylene in a solvent based on 
acetic acid in the presence of a catalyst to form 

terephthalic acid,
 

   introducing the oxidation exhaust gas into the 
distillation column and collecting finely dispersed 

solid matters by means of the solid matter collecting 
tray, and

 
   effecting distillation of substances contained 

in the oxidation exhaust gas through the packed bed, 
while removing heat and water out of the distillation 

column and recirculating the separated paraxylene and 
acetic acid to the oxidizing reactor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and
an apparatus for producing terephthalic acid, in
particular, for producing terephthalic acid by
oxidizing paraxylene with a molecular oxygen-contining
gas in a solvent based on acetic acid.First, a typical conventional process for
producing terephthalic acid from paraxylene is
explained with reference to the appended Fig. 3 showing
the flow diagram of the apparatus for such process.
The apparatus of Fig. 3 is composed of an oxidizing
reactor 1, a distillation column 2, a heat exchanger 3,
a scrubber 4 for recovering the unreacted paraxylene,
another scrubber 5 for recovering acetic acid, a
reboiler 6 and a condenser 7.A typical conventional process for producing
terephthalic acid is based on the steps of supplying
starting liquid materials, i.e. paraxylene, acetic
acid as the solvent therefor and a catalyst including
chemical components of cobalt, manganese and bromine,
to the reactor 1 via a raw stock supply line 11 and
introducing thereinto a molecular oxygen-containing gas
via an oxygen feed line 12, in order to cause therein
the oxidation of paraxylene to terephthalic acid. The
resulting product of terephthalic acid is withdrawn 
from the reactor together with the solvent and the
catalyst via a product discharge line 13 and forwarded
to the isolating refinery step.The exhaust gas from the oxidation flows,
together with the vapour generated due to the reaction
heat, from an oxidation exhaust line 14 into the heat
exchanger 3, in which they are cooled. A part of the
condensate liquid formed therein is returned to the
oxidizing reactor 1 via a reflux line 15 and the
remainder is forwarded to the distillation column 2 via
a communication line 16. The gas is then forwarded
through a communication line 17 to the paraxylene
scrubber 4, where paraxylene is recovered by contacting
the gas with water or with an acetic acid solution
supplied thereto from a liquid supply line 19. The gas
is then guided through a communication line 18 to the
acetic acid scrubber 5, in which the vaporized acetic
acid in the gas is recovered by contacting the gas with
water or with a dilute acetic acid solution supplied
thereto from a liquid supply line 20.The gas separated from paraxylene and acetic
acid is exhausted to the external of the system via a
gas exhaustion line 21, while the paraxylene-recovered
liquor is sent to the reactor 1 via a communication
line 22 and the acetic acid-recovered liqour is sent to
the distillation column 2 via a communication line 23.In the
