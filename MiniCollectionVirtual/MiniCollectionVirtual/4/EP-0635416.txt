<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rear luggage compartment door 
for a motor vehicle, and in particular to a luggage 
compartment door on which vehicle lamps are mounted. A rear luggage compartment door comprising an outer skin 
panel, an inner skin panel and a lamp cluster is known 
from DE-A-39 40 016. For styling reasons it is often desirable to position the 
vehicle lamps across the full width of the rear of the 
car. At the same time however it is desirable that the 
sill over which objects must be lifted to place them in 
the boot of the car is as low as possible. These two 
requirements dictate that at least some of the vehicle 
lamps must be mounted on the luggage compartment door. It is also desirable to manufacture the luggage 
compartment door so that there are no visible panel joins. According to the present invention there is provided a 
rear luggage compartment door for a motor vehicle, the 
door comprising an outer skin panel, an inner skin panel 
and a lamp cluster, wherein the lamp cluster is mounted 
on an infill panel which is connected between outer and 
inner skin panels, and wherein the lamp cluster conceals 
the join between the outer skin panel and the infill 
panel. In this specification, the term "lamp cluster" includes 
both passively and actively illuminated lamps and includes 
not only a single lamp but also any number of individual 
lamps. In a preferred embodiment, the infill panel provides a 
mounting surface for the lamp cluster behind the surface 
of the outer skin panel, so that when the lamp cluster is 
mounted on the infill panel, the front face of the cluster  
 
is substantially flush with the outer skin panel. The infill panel is preferably spot-welded to the outer 
skin panel, with the spot-welds being concealed by the 
lamp cluster. The connection of the infill panel to the 
inner skin panel can conveniently be through a clinched 
flange. The shape of the infill panel is preferably such that when 
the luggage compartment door is seen in cross section, 
parallel to the vehicle centreline, a generally 
rectangular recess is formed at the bottom rear edge of 
the door, with the back of this recess formed by the 
infill panel and the roof of the recess formed partly by 
the infill panel and partly by a flange of the outer skin 
panel to which the infill panel is spot-welded. The invention will now be further described, by way of 
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in 
which:

the infill panel. 
A luggage compartment door as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that the infill panel (38) provides a 

mounting surface for the lamp cluster (22) behind the 
surface of the outer skin panel (28), so that when the 

lamp cluster is mounted on the infill panel, the front 
face of the cluster is substantially flush with the outer 

skin panel (28). 
A luggage compartment door as claimed in Claim 1 or 
Claim 2, characterised in th
at the infill panel (38) is 
spot-welded to the outer skin panel (28), with the spot-weld 

being concealed by the lamp cluster. 
A luggage compartment door as claimed in any 
preceding claim, characterised in that the connection of 

the infill panel (38) to the inner skin panel (30) is 
through a clinched flange (36). 
A luggage compartment door as claimed in any 
preceding claim, characterised in that the shape of the 

infill panel (38) is such that when the luggage 
compartment door (18) is seen in cross section, parallel 

to the vehicle centreline, a generally rectangular recess 
is formed at the bottom rear edge of the door, with the  

 
back of this recess formed by the infill panel (38) and 

the roof of the recess formed partly by the infill panel 
(38) and partly by a flange (34) of the outer skin panel 

(28) to which the infill panel is spot-welded.
