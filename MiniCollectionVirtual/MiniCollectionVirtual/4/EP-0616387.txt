<ABSTRACT>
A connector terminal includes a first terminal 
having a cylindrical tubular portion, and a second 

terminal that can be connected to the cylindrical tubular 
portion. An outer terminal member and an inner terminal 

member for contacting respectively with outer and inner 
surfaces of the tubular portion are selectively attached 

to the second terminal. By selecting the two terminal 
members suitably, designs for respectively accommodating 

different allowable current values can be easily achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector terminal, and 
more particularly to a connector terminal that can selectively 
accommodate a small or relatively large current. In the near future, it is expected that electric cars 
will be put into practical use. In such a case, it is essential 
to charge the battery, and a connector for charging 
purposes is an important element to be studied. For example, female and male terminals used for a connector 
have a large area of contact between them, since a 
charging current is relatively large, and it is necessary 
that a condition of positive contact between them should be 
achieved. Referring to one example of known terminals for a 
large-current connector, a male terminal is slightly larger 
in diameter than a female terminal, and expanding slots are 
formed in the male terminal. With this construction, the 
male terminal, while deformed radially inwardly, can be inserted 
into the female terminal, so that the two terminals 
are connected together with a predetermined contact pressure. It is expected that a battery to be mounted on a large-size 
electric passenger car will be different in capacity 
from a battery to be mounted on a small-size electric passenger 
car. In this regard, the intensity of a charging 
current will differ depending on the kind of car. Specifically, 
a large-size passenger car may require 90A, while a 
small-size passenger car may require 60A. Therefore, the 
specification of the connector terminals must be changed in 
accordance with the allowable current value. For example, 
in order to increase the area of contact between the terminals 
with the increase of the allowable current value, the 
terminals of a larger diameter must be selected. Therefore, 
a plurality of kinds of connector terminals for connection 
to the car, as well as a plurality of kinds of terminals  
 
for connection to a charger, are prepared in accordance 
with the allowable value of the charging current, and such 
specially-designed terminals are used in combination. If 
the number of combinations is thus increased, the manufacturing 
cost naturally increases, and management becomes 
complicated. The present invention has been made in view of the 
foregoing, and an object of the invention is to provide a 
connector terminal that can be produced at lower costs, and 
wherein the management of the terminals can be simplified. This and other objects of the present invention have 
been achieved by providing a connector terminal according 
to claim 1. Accordingly, a
