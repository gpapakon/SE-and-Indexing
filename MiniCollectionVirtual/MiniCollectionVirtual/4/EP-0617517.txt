length of m bits into a variable length code (d, k; m, n; r) of a basic code length of n 

bits, which comprises the steps of: judging a binding length i (

) of the basic data; 

uniformly converting data of m×i bits into a code of n×r bits by using a conversion table

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a modulating method, a
demodulating method, a modulating apparatus, and a demodulating
apparatus, and more particularly to a modulating method and a
modulating apparatus for modulating data so that it is suitable
for data transmission, or recording onto a recording medium, and
a demodulating method and a demodulating apparatus for
demodulating a modulation code obtained by modulation to
reproduce data.In transmitting data, or recording data onto a recording
medium, e.g., a magnetic disc or an optical disc, etc.,
modulation of data is carried out so that it is suitable for
transmission or recording. As one of modulations, block coding
is known. In accordance with this block coding, a data train is
divided into blocks in units of m×i bits (hereinafter referred
to as data word) to convert them into code words comprised of n×i
bits in accordance with a suitable code rule. When i=1, block
code is a fixed length code. On the other hand, when a plurality
of i are selected, i.e., i≥1 and conversion is made by imax = r 
which is the maximum i, block code is a variable length code.
A code which has undergone block coding is called a variable
length code (d, k; m, n; r). Here i is called a binding length,
and binding length imax is r (hereinafter referred to as the
maximum binding length r). Further, d indicates the minimum
continuous numbers of the same symbols, i.e., so called minimum
run of, e.g., 0, and k indicates the maximum continuous numbers
of the same symbols, i.e., the maximum run of, e.g., 0.Meanwhile, in the case of recording a variable length code
obtained as described above onto, e.g., an optical disc, etc.,
the variable length code is further subjected to so called NRZI
(Non Return to Zero Inverted) modulation to carry out recording
on the basis of the NRZI modulated variable length code
(hereinafter referred to as a recording waveform train). When
it is now assumed that the minimum reversal interval of the
recording waveform train is Tmin and the maximum reversal interval
thereof is Tmax, it is desirable that the minimum reversal
interval Tmin is greater, i.e., the minimum run d is longer from
a viewpoint of the recording density. Various modulating systems
have been proposed. It is to be noted that according as the
maximum reversal interval Tmax is smaller, more satisfactory
results are obtained from a viewpoint of reproduction of clock
or so called jitter.In a more practical sense, in so called a compact disc (CD)
on which audio data is recorded, so called EFM (Eight to
