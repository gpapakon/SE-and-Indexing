<ABSTRACT>
A shift control system for shifting an automatic 
transmission from a predetermined gear stage to another 

by draining an oil pressure from predetermined 
frictional engagement means connected to an engine to 

release the same frictional engagement means and by 
feeding the oil pressure to another frictional engagement 

means to apply the same frictional engagement 
means while controlling the drain oil pressure of the 

frictional engagement means to be released and the application 
oil pressure of the frictional engagement 

means to be applied, during the shift. The shift control 
system comprises blowup detecting means for detecting 

the blown-up state of the engine being shifted 
in a clutch-to-clutch manner, and hydraulic control 

means for controlling at least one of the drain oil 
pressure of the frictional engagement means to be released 

and the application oil pressure of the frictional 
engagement means to be applied, on the basis of 

the blown-up state of the engine detected by the blowup 
detecting means, such that the amount of blowup of 

the engine may fall within a predetermined range. 
Since the rotation changing state of the engine being 

shifted is reflected upon the hydraulic control of the 
frictional engagement means participating in the  

 
clutch-to-clutch shift, it is possible to reliably 

prevent any excessive blowup of the engine and the reduction 
of the output shaft torque due to the tie-up 

of the frictional engagement means at all times.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for
controlling the shift of an automatic transmission
and, more particularly, to a shift control system for
an automatic transmission to execute the so-called
"clutch-to-clutch shift".The shift, which is effected by releasing first
frictional engagement element and by applying second
frictional engagement element, is called the "clutch-to-clutch
shift". In this shift, the so-called "overlap
state", in which the two frictional engagement
elements are temporarily given a torque capacity higher
than a predetermined value, is effected for an upshift
whereas the so-called "underlap state", in which
the two frictional engagement elements are temporarily
released, is effected for a downshift by the oil pressure
which is controlled by electric signals. At the time of the aforementioned shift in the
prior art, the controlled oil pressure has its correction
set to apply the amount of correction to subsequent
and later shifts by detecting the blown-up state
of the engine in terms of the input/output R.P.M. so
as to prevent the excessive engine blowup, which is
caused by the failure of the oil pressure to change,
as expected, for the electric signals or the reduction
of the output shaft torque due to the tie-up (as disclosed
in U.S.P. No. 5,018,068).In the construction described above, however, the
correction of the controlled oil pressure is so set
that the engine may not be blown up. Since the controlled
oil pressure is not corrected when the blowup
of the engine is not detected, the output shaft torque
drops to invite a shift shock if the tie-up occurs.It is, therefore, conceivable to detect the tie-up
so that the correction of the controlled oil pressure
may be set on the basis of the detected value.
However, it is difficult to detect the tie-up from the
input/output R.P.M. Still the worse, it costs a high
price and enlarges the size of the system to arrange a
special torque sensor for detecting the torque from
the input/output shaft, for example. For this arrangement,
the automatic transmission has to be substantially 
modified.EP-A-0 288 779 discloses a method for controlling the transfer of load from one
friction element to another friction element while making a gear ratio change in an
automatic transmission. The synchronous engine speed is increased by slipping
the offgoing clutch. A constant is calculated from known speed ratios of the gear
set, engine inertia, the difference in engine speed from synchronous speed and a
constant that corresponds to the output

A shift control system for an automatic transmission (A), comprising: first
(1) and second (2) frictional engagement elements; and first and second

hydraulic servos for applying/releasing said first (1) and second (2)
frictional engagement elements by feeding/draining an oil pressure thereto,

so that a predetermined gear stage is shifted to another gear stage by
draining the oil pressure from said first hydraulic servo to release said first

frictional engagement element (1) and by feeding the oil pressure to said
second hydraulic servo to apply said second frictional engagement

element (2), while controlling the drain oil pressure from said first hydraulic
servo and the feed oil pressure to said second hydraulic servo during said

gear stage shift, 
characterized by
: blow-up detecting means (3) for
detecting the maximum of the blow-up (ΔN
max
) of an engine (E) during
said shift until start of an inertial phase; and hydraulic control means (4) for

comparing said maximum (ΔN
max
) detected by said blow-up detecting
means and a target amount of blow-up, in which the engine (E) is blown up

to a predetermined extent from the non-blown-up state of the engine, to
control at least one of said drain oil pressure and said application oil

pressure by a latched duty ration (Dslu) of a solenoid valve (SLU) until
start of said inertial phase and to add a correction value (ΔDslu) after start

of said inertial phase thereby to effect said target blown-up state at the
next shift from said predetermined gear stage to said another gear stage, such

that the blown-up state of the engine(E) is lowered, if it is higher than said
target blown-up state, but is raised if it is lower than said target blown-up

state.

to said target blown-up state, to a positive value, if

said engine blown-up state is higher than said target
