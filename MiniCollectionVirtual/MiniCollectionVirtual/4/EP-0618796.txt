<ABSTRACT>
A method of preventing or alleviating a migraine headache which comprises administering a pharmaceutically effective amount of a mast cell degranulation blocking agent just prior to or during the prodromal phase of the migraine in the absence of an analgesic. The agent can also be administered in combination with a central nervous system stimulant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
alleviating or preventing a migraine headache through the
administration of a mast cell degranulation blocking
agent.Migraine headaches are known to produce the most
intense headache reported, which are comparable to that
of a brain aneurysm rupture. As many as 15% of all
people, especially in industrialized societies, are
sufferers, with an estimated yearly cost due to treatment
and work lost in the United States of America alone of
almost one billion dollars. Prior to the present
invention, there has been no effective way to prevent the
last minute onset of the migraine headache.The pathophysiology of migraine headaches involves
vasoconstriction (the closing or tightening of arteries,
which reduces blood flow) and vasodilation (the opening
of the vessels to increase blood flow). It appears that
a variety of stimuli, such as intense light, noise,
anxiety, exertion, cold, heat, hormones, food additives
and certain foods, result in constriction of extracranial
vessels. The vasoconstriction is followed by a
sequential or reflex powerful vasodilation, which
subsequently spreads to intracranial vessels. It is
during this phase that a patient feels an intense,
throbbing headache. Increased levels of norepinephrine, 
serotonin, bradykinin and substance P, as well as
products of tissue anoxia are considered to be the
endogenous pain producing molecules accompanied by direct
sensory nerve stimulation, because of stretching due to
vasoconstriction and vasodilation.The phases of a migraine headache have been separated
into the prodrome, aura and acute painful headache
stages. The prodrome is the primary stage of a migraine
attack characterized by an alteration of mood, energy or
passive functions. This stage can occur for hours before
the onset of the headache. The mood alterations include
euphoria, loquaciousness, unprovoked apathy, depression,
inertia, drowsiness, irritability, repetitive yawning,
aggression and heightened sensitivity to various levels
of sound (sonophobia). Nausea and vomiting, as well as
paresthesias in the extremities, may also accompany these
symptoms.The aura or second stage has been defined by the
onset of fear of light (photophobia) and visual
disturbances brought on by a reduction of cerebral blood
flow due to vasospasm.The headache phase is vascular with distension and
increased pulsation of cranial arteries. Increased
vascular permeability is associated with the release of
peptides, especially bradykinin and substance P, as well
as

absence of an analgesic in the preparation of a medicament for

use in a method of preventing or alleviating a migraine headache,
wherein a pharmaceutically effective amount of said medicament

is administered, to a patient
subject to migraine headaches, during the prodrome phase of the

migraine headache, but not during the acute migraine phase of the
migraine headache, in the absence of an analgesic administered

prior to the onset of the acute migraine phase.
