<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a CDMA transmission system comprising at least a transmitter in which a data sequence is spread with a code sequence, and comprising at least a receiver in which the data sequences are recovered by means of a detector. To load only the frequency portion used having the necessary frequency bandwidth in CDMA transmission systems, a frame structure is proposed in which the payload to be transmitted in a frame is compressed to a signal burst. A burst in a frame is then characterized by a frame-relative initial instant to and a dedicated duration ta.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a CDMA transmission system. The invention likewise relates to a
CDMA transmission method.In a transmission system based on Code-Division Multiple Access
(CDMA), the signals of different users are simultaneously switched in a common
frequency band and switched with a common carrier frequency. Code-division multiple
access systems are based on a spread band technique i.e. the signal to be transmitted is
spread over a frequency band which is considerably broader than the least required
frequency band for a signal transmission. The band spreading renders code-division
multiple access systems generally highly resistant to interference.For frequency band spreading in code-division multiple access systems each
(payload) bit to be transmitted is multiplied by a codeword agreed upon by transmitter and
receiver. For distinguishing between the bits of the payload data sequence to be coded, a
bit of the codeword is generally referenced a chip. The use of suitable codewords excludes,
in principle, mutual interference of the signals of the individual users.For obtaining a specific bit error rate with CDMA technology, a given
interference power requires a signal power that is approximately proportional to the
transmit payload bit rate. In CDMA systems, in which the individual users use different
payload bit rates depending on the application, for example, coded speech transmission,
facsimile transmission, and so on, it is desirable for reasons of economic use of frequencies
to load the CDMA transmission system only with the necessary frequency bandwidth.For example, from WO 92/15164 such a CDMA transmission system is
known in which a programmable clock generator is provided for obtaining a variable
bandwidth, by means of which generator the chip clock rate of each selected codeword is
predefined. The higher the chip clock rate is selected, the broader is the resultant
bandwidth of the spread transmit signal. For practical reasons the chip clock rates are selected to be integer multiples
of a basic clock rate. In the preferred embodiment of said Patent application the
bandwidth is therefore 1.2 MHz or a multiple thereof.Similary, from Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 17, no. 456, E-1418, abstract
of JP-A-5-102943 (NTT), 23 April 1993, a spread spectrum system is known in which for
the purpose to make a transmission quality constant irrespective of a bit rate a diffusion
factor is varied by the bit rate, and the transmitting power is controlled in inverse
proportion to the diffusion coefficient.
