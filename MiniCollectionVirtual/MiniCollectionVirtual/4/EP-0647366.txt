<ABSTRACT>
An emergency, fail safe capacitive energy source and circuit is used with an air damper (12) or valve (30) actuator. In particular, the capacitive source (68) and circuit (64) powers a motor (10) and both the motor as well as the capacitive source and circuit are completely contained within an actuator container (12, 30) of a small size. The capacitive source and circuit includes at least one storage capacitor (C4) utilized wherein the capacitor is coupled in series or parallel to power the motor (10). The capacitive source and circuit also includes a charging circuit (66) coupled between the motor drive power source (56) and the capacitor (68). A sensor (74) is coupled to the motor drive power source (50, 52, 54) and generates a control signal in the absence of power from the motor source. A switch (K1) passes power from the motor source (56) to the motor (10) in the absence of the control signal from the sensor and passes power from the capacitor in the presence of the control signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fail safe circuit for
ensuring movement of an air damper or valve to a fail-safe
position in the event of the failure of a power supply.More particularly the invention is concerned with a
fail-safe circuit of the kind comprising;
a fractional horsepower rotary motor coupled to the air
damper or valve for actuating the air damper or valve over a
range of positions, a control circuit connected to the motor
and connectable to a power supply line to be energised
therefrom in normal operation and to being operable in normal
operation to control the motor and thereby the position of
the air damper or valve, the motor being operable at a given
torque in normal operation to move said air damper or valve,
and fail-safe means for ensuring that upon failure of the
power supply, the air damper or valve is moved to its fail-safe
position.Electric or electronic damper motors are utilized to
open and close fresh air dampers, supply air dampers, smoke
control dampers, return air dampers, relief dampers, fan
vortex dampers, exhaust air dampers and fire dampers. These
dampers are utilized to control the flow of air through air
ducts. Other types of dampers are categorized as variable
air volume terminal unit dampers, constant air volume
terminal unit dampers, two position terminal unit dampers,
fume hood supply and exhaust dampers and clean room supply
and exhaust dampers. Again, these dampers are used to open
and close vents in air ducts. Typically, the damper includes
a motor which rotates a drive mechanism to open, close or
position the air vents to certain locations thereby
controlling the air flow through the duct work. Sometimes,
the rotative movement of the motor is converted into linear
movement thereby providing a linear damper actuator.Valve actuators are generally classified as rotary valve
actuators or linear push-pull valve actuators. Several types
of valves can be controlled by such valve actuators. For
example, two-way ball valves, three-way ball valves, two-way
globe valves, three-way globe valves, two-way plug valves,
three-way plug valves, butterfly valves, rotary delta P
valves and shoe valves. Essentially, valve actuators convert
a control signal into a valve drive signal which affects a 
motor in the actuator thereby mechanically changing the
mechanical position of the valve stem control.In many systems, it is commonplace to include a fail
safe sub-system which closes or opens the damper or the valve
in the event power is cut to the damper or valve actuator
circuit
