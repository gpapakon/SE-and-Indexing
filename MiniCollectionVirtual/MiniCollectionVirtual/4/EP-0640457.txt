<ABSTRACT>
A process for demoulding curved hollow articles and an injection mould for curved hollow articles (5) of plastic having an internal undercut at one end of the hollow article, having a folding core (22) for shaping the internal undercut, where the folding core comprises two groups, each of n folding segments (27), which are mounted on a core tube (21) at various angles to the core axis, form a continuous unit in the injection state and, in the folded state, allow demoulding of the undercut, having a core block (16), which is pivotable about a pivot axis (15) of a core frame (12) and which is adjacent to a straight core guide (19) on which the core tube (21) of the folding core (22) can be moved, and a bend core (20) which is concentric to the pivot axis (15) is installed, this bend core (20), in the injection state, forming the actual injection core together with a straight core piece (11) which can be inserted and removed.

A process for demoulding curved hollow bodies of 
plastics material having an internal undercut at one end of 

the hollow body, according to which a collapsible core 
(22), which is intended for moulding the internal undercut, 

is guided on a straight core guide (19) and comprises two 
groups of in each case n collapsible segments (27) which 

are guided on a core tube (21) at different angles to the 
core axis and complement one another in the injection 

condition, is made to demould the internal undercut in the 
collapsed condition, according to which the core guide (19) 

is then pivoted with an adjoining curved core about the 
centre of curvature of the curved core, and according to 

which a straight core piece (11) supplementing the curved 
core is withdrawn. 
An injection mould for curved hollow bodies (5) of 
plastics material having an internal undercut at one end of 

the hollow body, having a collapsible core (22) for 
moulding the internal undercut, the collapsible core (22) 

comprising two groups of in each case n collapsible 
segments (27) which are guided on a core tube (21) at 

different angles to the core axis, complement one another 
in the injection condition and permit the undercut to be 

demoulded in the collapsed condition, having a core block 
(16) which is pivotal about a pivot pin (15) of a core 

frame (12) and to which a curved core (20) is attached, 
adjoining a straight core guide (19) on which the core tube 

(21) of the collapsible core (22) is displaceable, which 
curved core (20) is concentric to the pivot pin (15) and is 

supplemented in the injection condition by a straight 
insertable and retractable core piece (11) to form the 

actual injection core. 
An injection mould according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the core frame (12) is displaceable in the opening  

 
direction of the injection mould. 
An injection mould according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that a cylinder unit (17) actuated by 

pressurized medium is provided to pivot the core frame 
(12). 
An injection mould according to one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that a stripper plate (32) is arranged on 

the core frame (12), the collapsible core reaching through 
the opening in the stripper plate.
