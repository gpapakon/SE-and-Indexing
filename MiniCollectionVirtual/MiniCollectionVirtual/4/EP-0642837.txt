<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to a process for the application of a liquid die wall treatment by means of
a spray element, especially for mold sprayers, according to the preamble of claim 1.
Such a spray element may
comprise a feed line for fluid working medium and possibly a feed line for
control air: and an atomizing device connected to the feed line for working
medium. The metering or switching valve can be controlled as a function of pressure,
with an elastically pretensioned valve body for the optional making or
breaking of the connection between the feed line for working medium and the
atomizer.Spray elements of this type are used in, for example, the spray tools of
the mold spray devices required between the cycles of die-casting, drop forging,
and other manufacturing operations involving the hot and cold working of
metals to prepare the parts of the die for the next sequence of operations.
For this purpose, the die is opened, and the spray tool is moved in between
the parts, which are then cleaned of metal residues, lubricant residues, and
other contaminants by the use of compressed air. They are then sprayed with a
lubricant and can also be cooled with water.Spray elements of the basic type in question are known, for example, from
the generic U.S. Patent No. 4,714,199 and US Patent No. 4,365,754. In these spray elements, the
valve body of the switching valve consists of a piston. The piston is pretensioned
by a helical spring to keep the switching valve in the closed position,
and in this position the piston thus prevents fluid working medium from passing
through the switching valve and reaching the atomizer. According to what
has been said above, the spray elements known from U.S. Patents No. 4,714,199
and No. 4,365,754 have a complicated and, therefore, expensive design.Another spray element of the general type in question is known from U.S.
Parent No. 3,807,641. In this spray element, the valve body of the switching 
valve is formed by a flexible membrane, which is pretensioned by a a piston,
which is itself pretensioned by a helical compression spring to keep the
switching valve in the closed position. As result, the spray element known
from U.S. Patent No. 3,807,641 also has a complicated and, therefore, expensive
design.Against this background, the task of the present invention is to provide
a process of the general type in question which is simpler and
which therefore can be performed at lower cost.This task is accomplished in accordance with the invention as claimed in claim 1. Preferably,
the

Process for the application of a liquid die wall treatment agent to
areas of the die walls (
12a
, 
12b
) of a molding device (
12
) by means of at
least one spray element (
20
) with metering of the flow rate of the die wall
treatment agent by a metering valve (
62
), which influences an effective metering
cross section for the liquid die wall treatment agent and which can be

influenced by a secondary fluid,

characterized by the features

(a) a metering valve (
62
) with a valve membrane (
68
) of variable shape,
kept essentially free of guide friction, is used;
(b) one side of the valve membrane (
68
) is acted on by the die wall
treatment agent, while the other side is acted on by the secondary fluid;
(c) the pressure on at least one side of the membrane (
68
) is influenced
by flow rate-adjusting means (
452
, 
441
, 
428
, 
439

settings, result in flow rates reproducibly coordinated to these settings;

and
(d) the different flow rates are determined by different floating
states of the membrane (

Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that, as the secondary
fluid, a control fluid is used which is not mixed with the die wall treatment

agent.
Process according to one of Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the
pressure of the die wall treatment agent is kept constant, and the pressure of

the secondary fluid is varied by acting on the flow rate adjusting means (

of monitoring the contact behavior of the die wall treatment agent with the

rate-adjusting means (
