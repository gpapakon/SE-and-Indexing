<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a suction device for
supplying air and fuel to combustion chambers of an internal
combustion engine, and more particularly to such a suction
device which can be constructed compactly.In connection with a V-type internal combustion engine having
a plurality of cylinders arranged in a V-shape, there is
described a conventional suction device in United States
Patents No.5,003,933 and 5,094,194, for example. In this
conventional suction device, a plurality of individual suction
pipes and a collector for distributing a suction air to the
individual suction pipes are integrated compactly, but an air
cleaner, a suction air quantity detecting means, a throttle
valve, and fuel injection valves are not integrated. These
latter elements are individually mounted.EP-A-523027 and JP-A-63100269 both describe intake
systems for in-line internal combustion engines. In each case
an air filter and suction pipes are integrated with a
collection chamber for distributing air to the cylinders of
the engine. In the system shown in EP-A-523027 air is drawn
radially inwardly through the air filter and then drawn
vertically downwardly through a throttle valve to be
distributed generally outwardly to the suction pipe inlets.
In contrast, JP-A-63100269 describes a system in which air
flows longitudinally from an inlet, through the filter, to a 
U-shape pipe in which the direction of air is reversed and
passes through a throttle valve before entering the
collection chamber in which flow is also in a generally
longitudinal direction to the inlets of the suction pipes.EP-A-586123, which is prior art under A.54(3) only, shows
an intake system for an in-line internal combustion engine.
Air flows along an inlet air passage and is then reversed
in a connecting passage, housing a throttle valve, to flow
in the opposite direction in a surge tank. The surge tank
feeds inlet conduits to the engine's cylinders, the air
flow in these conduits being perpendicular to that in the
inlet passage and surge tank.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
suction device which can be constructed compactly so as to
integrate parts from an air cleaner to suction ports and
eliminate spaces other than an air passage for supplying
suction air to an internal combustion engine, thereby
increasing room for mounting other parts and the internal
combustion engine in an engine room of an automobile or
reducing a size of the engine room to effectively use the
engine room.Accordingly, the present invention provides a
