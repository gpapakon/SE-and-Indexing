<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with sequestration of hydrophobic 
organic substances with carbonaceous adsorbents, and especially to sequestration of 
toxic, hydrophobic organic substances in surface-water sediments using 
carbonaceous adsorbents derived from porous synthetic polymers. Discharge of pollutants into surface waters has created a long-lasting 
problem 
of toxicity for organisms that live in those waters and the higher organisms that feed 
on them, including human beings. Hydrophobic, organic pollutants tend to settle 
into the sediment at the bottom of these waters and remain there for long periods; 
they are not easily removed by natural water flow because of their hydrophobic 
nature and their location in the pore water of the sediment. As a result, sediment-dwelling 
organisms are exposed to these pollutants, absorb them into their systems, 
and pass them on to higher organisms that eat the bottom dwellers. Of particular interest to regulatory authorities as sediment pollutants are 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as naphthalene, acenaphthene, 
phenanthrene, anthracene and fluoranthene, and pesticides such as dieldrin and 
endrin. In addition to being toxic themselves, these pollutants serve as indicators of 
sediment pollution in general. Methods for removing or adsorbing pollutants in sediments have heretofore 
focused on removal of the sediment by dredging, sequestering the polluted 
sediment in situ by capping it, as for example with clean sediment, or by treating the 
sediment with an adsorbent such as activated carbon. Dredging produces large 
volumes of contaminated mud which creates disposal problems, and capping poses 
the problem of assuring that the polluted sediment remains sequestered despite 
erosion or possible human activity affecting the bottom, and that the pollutants do 
not re-enter the water or clean sediment by diffusion or other processes. Carbon 
must first be brought into contact with the pollutants, and then be removed from the 
surface-water body to avoid a slow release of the pollutant from the carbon. Wide 
dispersal of the carbon facilitates contacting the pollutants, but complicates carbon 
removal, while containment of the carbon for easy removal interferes with its contact 
with the pollutants. Methods for removing adsorbent after it has adsorbed 
pollutants were disclosed by Dawson et al., US-A-4,134,831; these include confining 
the adsorbent in magnetically attractable, porous bags, or adding magnetically 
attractable material, such as iron

<CLAIMS>
A process for sequestering hydrophobic organic materials in surface-water 
sediment contaminated with such organic materials, which comprises 

contacting the sediment with partially pyrolyzed, carbonaceous adsorbent particles 
having at least 85% by weight carbon and a carbon-to-hydrogen atom ratio of 

between about 1.5:1 and about 20:1, and allowing the sediment to remain in contact 
with the adsorbent particles. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the organic materials are 
present at from about 10 nanograms to about 20 grams per kilogram of sediment. 
A process as claimed in claim 2, wherein the organic materials are 
present at from about 1 microgram to about 10 grams per kilogram of sediment. 
A process as claimed in claim 3, wherein the organic materials are 
present at from about 10 microgram to about 3 grams per kilogram of sediment. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the adsorbent 
particles are present at from about 1 gram to about 200 grams per kilogram of 

sediment. 
A process as claimed in claim 5, wherein the adsorbent particles are 
present at from about 5 grams to about 100 grams per kilogram of sediment. 
A process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the adsorbent particles are 
present at from about 10 gram to about 50 grams per kilogram of sediment. 
Use of partially pyrolyzed, carbonaceous adsorbent particles having at 
least 85% by weight carbon and a carbon-to-hydrogen atom ratio of between about 

1.5:1 and about 20:1 to sequester hydrophobic organic materials in surface-water 
sediment contaminated with such organic materials.
