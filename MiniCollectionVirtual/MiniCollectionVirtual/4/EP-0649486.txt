<ABSTRACT>
A substantially enclosed sound absorbing unit (21) for an anechoic chamber is disclosed. The sound absorbing unit (12) includes a substantially flat panel member (25) comprising a layer of sound absorptive material. An anechoic member (21) is disposed adjacent to the flat panel member (25). The anechoic member (21) is disposed adjacent to a base (29) and a generally spaced apart sound transparent wall member (26). The wall member (26) includes a layer of sound absorptive material (27) and a cover sheet (20) made of perforated, substantially sound reflective material. The free space (30) of the perforated cover sheet (20) is at least 7 percent of the total area of the cover sheet (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to anechoic chambers and more specifically to new anechoic wedges and structural elements for constructing such chambers.An anechoic chamber is a room in which acoustically free field conditions exist. For practical measurements, it must also be clear of extraneous noise interferences. An environment meeting these conditions is a requirement for precision acoustical measurements. Anechoic chambers are widely used in the development of quieter products in many industries and institutions including the following: aircraft, electrical, transportation, communications, business machines, medical research and universities.An acoustical free field exists in a homogenous, isotropic medium which is free from reflecting boundaries. In an ideal free field environment, the inverse square law would function perfectly. This means that the sound pressure level (LP) generated by a spherically radiating sound source decreases six decibels (6 dB) for each doubling of the distance from the source. A room or enclosure designed and constructed to provide such an environment is called an anechoic chamber.An anechoic chamber usually must also provide an environment with controlled sound pressure level (LP) free from excessive variations in temperature, pressure and humidity. Outdoors, local variations in these conditions, as well as wind and reflections from the ground, can significantly and unpredictably disturb the uniform radiation of sound waves. This means that a true acoustical free field is only likely to be encountered inside an anechoic chamber.For an ideal free field to exist with perfect inverse square law characteristics, the boundaries must have a sound absorption coefficient of unity at all angles of incidence.Conventionally, an anechoic element is defined as one which should not have less than a .99 normal incidence sound absorption coefficient throughout the frequency range of interest. In such a case, the lowest frequency in a continuous decreasing frequency sweep at which the sound absorption coefficient is 0.99 at normal incidence is defined as the cut-off frequency. Thus, in an anechoic chamber, 99% of the sound energy at or above the cut-off frequency is absorbed. For less than ideal conditions, different absorption coefficients may be established to define a cut-off frequency.As mentioned above, another characteristic of a true free field is that sound behaves in accordance with the inverse square law. In the past, testing wedges in an impedance tube has been a means for qualifying
