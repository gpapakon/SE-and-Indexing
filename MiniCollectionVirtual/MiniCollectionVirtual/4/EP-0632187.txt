<ABSTRACT>
The centre piston fixture (10) comprises at least one centre piston, which grips the end of the body (9) vertically to a running cut plane section (E). The control body (9) is guided in or parallel to the cut plane section radial guide. The centre piston is held on the walled side of the rotating axis (6) by a bearing (11) rotatable in the housing (1). The bearing has a journal which engages, with play, in the groove in the guide.

Axial piston machine having a housing, having a 
cylinder barrel rotatably mounted in this housing, 

which cylinder barrel is supported with an end face on 
a control body which for its part is supported 

radially displaceably on an end face of the housing 
and has two control ports, separated from one another 

by two change-over webs, connected to a suction 
connection and to a pressure connection of the 

housing, whereby at least one of the end faces of the 
cylinder barrel or the housing and the bounding 

surface of the control body facing this is spherically 
formed, and having a c
entring piston arrangement which 
supports the control body laterally on the housing 

against the high pressure in the region of the control 
port connected to the pressure connection,
 
characterised in that,
 
the centring piston device (10) includes at least one 

centring piston (31) which engages in the edge region 
of the control body (9) perpendicularly of a sectional 

plane (E) running in the axial direction through the 
change-over webs (27, 28), and in that on the side of 

the axis of rotation (6) away from the centring piston 
(31) the control body (9) is held rotatably on the 

housing (1, 4) by means of a bearing (11) and is 
guided along a radially running guide (12) in or 

parallel to the sectional plane (E). 
Axial piston machine according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that,
 
the bearing (11) is arranged in the immediate vicinity 

of the axis of rotation (6). 
Axial piston machine according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that,
 
the bearing (11) includes a bearing pin which engages  

 
with play in the guide (12) which is formed as a guide 

groove. 
Axial piston machine according to claim 3,
 
characterised in that,
 
the bearing pin (11) is formed at the end face (5) of 

the housing (1, 4) and the guide groove (12) is formed 
in the associated bounding surface (20) of the control 

body (9). 
Axial piston machine according to any preceding claim,
 
characterised in that,
 
the centring piston (31) is displaceably arranged in 

a cylindrical blind bore (29) in the control body (9), 
defining a pressure chamber (33), and in that the 

pressure chamber (33) is connected to the control port 
(24) connected to the pressure connection (26). 
Axial piston machine according to any preceding claim,
 
characterised in that,
 
the centring piston arrangement (10) includes a 

further, second centring piston (32), which is 
displaceably arranged in a further, second cylindrical 

blind bore (30) which is aligned with the above-mentioned 
first blind bore (29) and defines in this 

second blind bore a further, second pressure chamber 
(34) which is connected to the remaining control port 

(23) and supports the control body (9) on the housing 
(1, 2) oppositely to the pressure direction of the 

above-mentioned first centring piston (31). 
Axial piston machine according to any preceding claim,
 
characterised in that,
 
the end of each centring piston (31, 32) projecting 

out of the respective cylindrical blind bore (29 or 
30) is supported on a support surface (37 or 39) of 

the housing (1, 2) running parallel to the sectional  
 

plane (E), which support surface has a length 
corresponding at least to the maximum radial 

displacement of the control body (9) in operation, 
parallel to the sectional plane (E).
