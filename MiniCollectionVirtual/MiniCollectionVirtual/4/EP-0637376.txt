Method for measuring the concentration of a 
detection gas in a measuring gas containing interfering 

gas, where a zero gas free of the detection gas and the 
measuring gas are supplied to an analysis device, 

whereby interfering gas is added to the zero gas in 
such a way that the concentration of interfering gas in 

the zero gas is equal to that in the measuring gas 
supplied to the analyzer, characterized in that to the 

measuring gas, the zero gas and possibly a calibration 
gas containing the detection gas in known concentration 

interfering gas is added under corresponding 
conditions. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in 
that interfering gas is partially removed from the 

measuring gas and then added up to a certain 
concentration. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the measuring gas, the zero gas 

and possibly the calibration gas are conducted 
successively via the same device for the addition of 

interfering gas. 
Arrangement for measuring the concentration of 
a detection gas in a measuring gas containing water 

vapour as interfering gas, having a two-beam analysis 
device (AG), which is supplied with the measuring gas 

and a zero gas free of the detection gas, and having a 
humidifier through which zero gas flows, characterized 

in that a second humidifier (B) lies in the measuring-gas 
supply line, which humidifier is structurally 

united with the humidifier through which the zero gas 
flows. 
Arrangement for measuring the concentration of 
a detection gas in a measuring gas containing water 

vapour as interfering gas, having an analysis device 
(AG), which is supplied with the measuring gas and a  

 
zero gas free of the detection gas, and having a 

humidifier through which zero gas flows, characterized 
in that a gas changeover device (V1, V2) is present, 

which conducts the measuring gas, the zero gas and 
possibly a calibration gas with known concentration of 

the detection gas successively through a single 
humidifier (B).
