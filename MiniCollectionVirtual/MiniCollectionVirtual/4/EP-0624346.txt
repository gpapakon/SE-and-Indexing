<ABSTRACT>
A blunt tipped trocar which uses ultrasonic energy in 
the form of vibrations to assist a user in penetrating 

tissue. In one embodiment of the invention, a feedback 
mechanism is provided which senses a variation in load on 

the trocar tip and adjusts the ultrasonic energy level of 
the vibrating tip in accordance with the load condition. 

Another embodiment of the invention provides a trocar with 
a self-contained ultrasonic generator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to trocars used to puncture
tissue for accessing areas of the body to perform
endoscopic surgery and, in particular, to a blunt tipped
trocar which uses ultrasonic energy to assist in
puncturing tissue.A trocar assembly for use in endoscopic surgical
procedures generally comprises two major components, a
trocar obturator and a tube or cannula. Typically, the
obturator is initially positioned within the cannula and
has a sharp and pointed puncturing tip which is extendable
from the cannula. The obturator tip is used to penetrate
the skin and underlying tissue to provide cannula access
to a body cavity. The obturator is then removed and
endoscopic surgery performed through the cannula.Surgical trocars and similar instruments are known in the art. For example, WO-A-92/14514
discloses a surgical trocar for puncturing tissue using "remote" cutting, called
arcing. The surgical trocar comprises an operative sleeve adapted for disposition across a
tissue barrier and an obturator removably disposed in the sleeve. At its distal end, the
obturator is provided with a duck bill shaped tip incorporating a cutting element, typically
a wire. A source of energy is introduced to the cutting element for energising the cutting
element to cut the tissue barrier.DE-A-37 07 921 discloses an ultrasonic surgical instrument for resection and
removal of tissue. The surgical instrument has a probe with a cauterising element at its
working end. The cauterising element may be a bipolar electrode connected to a high
frequency oscillator or a heating element connected to a current source. The surgical
instrument is introduced into the body via an endoscopic cannula and pressed against the
tissue to be resected. Resection is achieved using ultrasonic vibrations and the resected
tissue is removed from the resection site by suction.CA-1 098 003 discloses a vibrating surgical instrument for making passageways
through body tissue to provide access for surgical operations beneath the tissue. The size
of the vibrating tissue penetrating probe is determined by the length of tissue fiber one
wishes to penetrate. For muscle tissue, a suitable probe size is in the order of millimeters.
The amplitude of oscillation of the probe is in the same order as the size of the probe itself.US-5 123 903 discloses a medical instrument useful for performing ultrasonic
tissue disruption and removal. The instrument is constructed such that it does not disrupt
connective tissue, such as blood vessels and muscle tissue.WO-A-92/11815
