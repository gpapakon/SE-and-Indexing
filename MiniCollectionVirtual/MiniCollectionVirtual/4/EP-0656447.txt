<ABSTRACT>
A proposal is made for a control system for splitting up the delivery flow made available by at least one pump (20) in hydraulic systems between a plurality of loads according to the principle of load pressure independence when the loads (8, 9) are undersupplied, a compensator (26, 27) essentially comprising a piston (28, 29) and an actuating element being arranged downstream of each spool valve, which has a predetermined control cross-section, and each load (8, 9) arranged downstream of the compensator (26, 27) receiving a predeterminable portion of the delivery flow as a function of the degree of undersupply by virtue of the fact that the pistons (28, 29) of the compensators (26, 27) are subjected to different forces, which bring about different opening pressures.

Control means for apportioning, between a plurality of consumers (8, 9), the delivery
flow made available by at least one pump in hydraulic systems, according to the

load-sensing principle, especially for construction machines, such as wheel
loaders (1), graders or excavators, wherein at least one compensator (26, 27)

having a piston (28, 29) is arranged downstream of a respective control valve (22,
23) having a pre-specifiable control cross-section (A
1
, A
2
) and each consumer (8, 9)
downstream of the compensator (26, 27) receives a pre-specifiable portion of the

delivery flow (Q
max
) by means of the fact that the pistons (28, 29) of the
compensators (26, 27), under the action of different forces exerted thereon, unblock

the passage cross-sections to the consumers (8, 9) at different opening pressures,

characterised in that

each piston (28, 29) cooperates with a respective spring (30, 31) as actuating
element, with each of the springs (30, 31) having a different spring force, in such a

manner that, in the event of the consumers (8, 9) being undersupplied, the
apportioning of the delivery flow changes automatically as a result of those different

spring forces of the springs (30, 31) depending on the measure of the degree of
undersupply resulting from the prevailing delivery flow of the pump (20) compared

with the full supply.
Control means according to claim 1,

characterised in that

the degree of priority of the individual consumers (9) over the other consumers (8)
increases as the degree of undersupply increases, in accordance with the selected

spring forces of the springs (30, 31).
Control means according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that force is arranged to
be applied to the piston (28, 29) in question by means of a combination of

mechanical spring and pneumatic/hydraulic or electromagnetic actuation. 
Control means according to claim 3, characterised in that the apportioning ratio of
the forces resulting from mechanical spring and pneumatic/hydraulic or electromagnetic

actuation, which produce the overall opening pressure, can be set in a
pre-specifiable manner.
