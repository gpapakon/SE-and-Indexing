<ABSTRACT>
Device for storing bicycles (5) in a slanting position. This device 
consists of first (1) and second (2) accommodation means, one serving to 

accommodate the front or rear wheel, and the other serving to accommodate 
the other wheel. The first accommodation means are placed near a vertical 

boundary such as a wall (8) and are immovably connected to the ground. 
The 

second accommodation means are rotatable, so that the frame of the 
bicycle (5) can be moved upwards. The axis of rotation (9) of the second 

accommodation means (2) lies near the axis of the wheel (10) which is in 
the first 

accommodation means. A gas spring (13) is used to support the second 
accommodation means, in order to bear the weight of the bicycle (5) 

itself 
and said accommodation means. In the upward-moved position of the second 

accommodation means (2), they meet locking means (11), so that the 
bicycle in 

question can be locked in position when it has been moved upwards.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for storing a bicycle 
in a considerably slanting position, comprising first and second 
accommodation means for the accommodation of the front and rear wheels of 
the bicycle, and means for tilting at least one of said accommodation 
means. Such a device is generally known in the prior art. Various 
authorities are increasingly promoting travel by bicycle, in order to 
avoid traffic jams and environmental problems as far as possible. On the 
other hand, there is the problem that bicycles are becoming increasingly 
prey to theft and/or vandalism. For the more expensive bicycle, placing 
it in a bicycle rack with a simple lock has long since become an 
inadequate way of ensuring that it will not be stolen. The bicycle is 
often removed leaving the wheel behind, or the lock is picked. A solution has been found to this problem by providing lock-ups, 
in the case of which one bicycle can be placed in each lock-up. By 
paying a certain sum, the user can obtain the key or code to the lock-up 
in question and is the only person who has access to that lock-up through 
a door. It is relatively difficult to vandalize such a lock-up, so that 
the bicycle in it will be stored safely. Although such a structure is 
extremely satisfactory from the point of view of safety, the drawback is 
that such structures take up a relatively large amount of space. One of 
the reasons for promoting travel by bicycle was that bicycles do not take 
up much space, so that this solution is found to be ultimately not very 
effective. Besides, such structures are quite expensive, and such storage 
lock-ups have the problem of being difficult to clean. It is the object of the present invention to provide a device 
by means of which it is possible in a simple manner to store a bicycle 
securely and safely, while little space is required. This object is achieved in the case of a device of the type 
described above through the fact that near the first accommodation means 
there is an essentially vertical boundary which prevents the bicycle from 
being moved past the first accommodation means, and that the second 
accommodation means are made tiltable, their axis of rotation being 
disposed in such a way that it corresponds essentially to the axis of the 
wheel which is in the first accommodation means, and in the movement path 
of the second accommodation means locking means are fitted high up, for 
engaging in a locking manner with the second accommodation means. The invention is based on the idea
