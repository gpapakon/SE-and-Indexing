<ABSTRACT>
A reclining modular seating section having a recliner assist 
apparatus for initiating reclining movement of the seating 

section and extending movement of a leg rest assembly thereof. 
The release assist apparatus includes an insert member (346) fixedly 

secured to a drive rod (324) of a recliner mechanism of the seating 
unit. A drive bracket (326) is fixedly secured to the insert member (346) 

and pivotally coupled to an L-shaped coupling bracket (328). The 
L-shaped coupling bracket (328) is in turn coupled to a biasing spring 

(330) which exerts a tensioning force to drive the drive bracket (326) 
and drive rod (324), to thereby cause the seating section to assume a 

reclined position with its leg rest member in an extended 
position when the drive bracket reaches an over center position. 

A release assist bracket (322) is disposed coaxially about the insert 
member (346) and has an end thereof coupled to a handle member (316) 

which is graspable by an occupant of the seating unit. By pulling on 
the handle member (316), the release assist bracket (322) urges the drive 

bracket (326) to an over center position, thereby enabling the biasing 
(330) spring to continue driving the drive rod (324) so as to extend a 

leg rest assembly and simultaneously recline a seatback portion of 
the seating unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a seating unit having 
a release assist apparatus for 
articles of furniture such as chairs, sofas and loveseats. Conventionally, recliner type seating units (i.e. 
chairs, sofas, loveseats and the like), generally require a 
predetermined distance between an adjacent wall surface and the 
seatback to avoid contact therebetween during reclined operation. 
In addition, loose seat cushions are not generally used in most 
recliner type seating units due to the height requirements 
associated with operably supporting the mechanical recliner 
mechanism under the seat. Reclining mechanisms typically generate a relatively 
large amount of frictional drag which must be overcome for smooth 
movement between an "upright" and a "tilted" position. In 
particular, lighter weight seat occupants must normally exert a 
deliberate leveraged thrust or force, in addition to pulling the 
actuator lever, for completely extending the leg rest and moving 
the seat section to its "tilted" position. Moreover, it is often 
difficult for the seat occupant to return to the upright position 
from the "tilted" or a fully "reclined" position due to the  
 
height and the upward angular tilt of the seat relative to the 
reclined seatback. As such, the occupant must exert a relatively 
large and deliberate leveraged force to return the reclined seat 
section to the full upright position. Another drawback 
associated with recliners is that the leg rest assembly cannot 
be retracted to its stowed position from an extended elevated 
position until after the seat occupant has completely returned 
the seat section to its fully upright position. As is known, virtually all traditional recliner type 
seating units require the seat occupant to either forcibly urge 
a portion of the seating section forwardly (i.e. by pulling on 
an arm portion of the chair), or manually move some type of 
actuating lever to initiate movement of the leg rest assembly 
from a retracted position toward an extended and elevated 
position. While most recliner type seating units have proven to 
be generally successful, it nevertheless would be desirable to 
permit the seat occupant to deliberately initiate movement of the 
leg rest assembly toward its extended position with virtually no 
physical effort. Such a leg rest release arrangement would be 
particularly advantageous for elderly or handicapped persons who 
typically have difficulty, because of lack of strength, in using 
conventional release means (i.e. movement of levers or

<CLAIMS>
A seating unit (300c) having a release assist 
apparatus (314), said seating unit being adapted for use in 

an article of furniture of the type having a frame section 
within which said seating unit is secured, said seating 

unit comprising: 

(a) a seat member (306); 
(b) a leg rest assembly (310) supported for 
movement between a retracted position and an extended 

position; 
(c) drive means; 
(d) a manually engagable release member (316); and 
(e) biasing means (330);
 
   characterised in that: 


said drive means includes tubular drive rod (324) for 
urging said leg rest assembly (310) into said extended 

position, said drive means being movable between a locked 
position wherein said leg rest assembly (310) is releasably 

retained in said retracted position and a release position 
wherein said leg rest assembly (310) is permitted to move 

toward said extended position; 
said manually engagable release member (316) is adapted to 
be grasped by an occupant of said seating unit and pulled 

outwardly away from said seat member (306) of said seating 
unit by said occupant; 
said seating unit further comprises: 
(f) a release assist bracket (322) having an inner  
 

end portion (322a) and an outer end portion (322c) and 
being disposed coaxially with said drive rod (324) and 

movable rotationally relative to said drive rod (324); 
(g) an insert member (346) coupleable to said 
tubular drive rod (324); 
(h) a drive bracket (326) having an inner end 
portion (326a) and an outer end portion (326c), said inner 

end portion (326a) being fixedly secured to said insert 
member (346), said drive bracket (326) further having a 

fixed post member (326e) extending transversely therefrom; 
(i) an L-shaped coupling bracket (328) having an 
inner end (328b) and an outer end (328a), said outer end 

(328a) being pivotally coupled to said outer end portion 
(326c) of said drive bracket (326); and 
(j) a flexible cable (318) coupled to said outer 
end portion (322c) of said release assist bracket (322) and 

to said release member (316) for causing said release 
assist bracket (322) to be moved rotationally in response 

to movement of said release member (316); 
said biasing means (330) has a first end (330a) and a 
second end (330b), said first end (330a) being secured to a 

portion of said seating unit and said second end (330b) 
being secured to said inner end (328b) of said L-shaped 

coupling bracket (328); and 
said outer end portion (322c) of said release assist 
bracket (322) is disposed in general lateral alignment with 

said fixed post member (326e) such that  
 

engagement of said release member (316) by said seat 
occupant causes said outer end portion (322c) to abuttingly 

engage with said fixed post member (326e), thereby urging 
said fixed post member (326e) rotationally into an over 

center position whereby said biasing means (330) and said 
L-shaped coupling bracket (328) cause said drive bracket 

(326) to be driven rapidly rotationally to thereby cause 
said leg rest assembly (310) to be urged into said extended 

position. 
The seating unit (300c) of claim 1, wherein 
said biasing means (330) is operably coupled to said drive 

bracket means (326) and a portion of said seating unit 
(300c) for urging said drive bracket means (326) towards 

said locked position after a predetermined degree of travel 
of said leg rest assembly (310) as said leg rest assembly 

(310) is urged into said retracted position. 
The seating unit (300c) of claim 1 or claim 2, 
further comprising a slotted connecting bracket (320) 

fixedly secured to said flexible cable (318) for pivotally 
coupling with said release assist bracket (322) and a 

return spring (319) operationally associated with said 
flexible cable (318) to cause said handle member (316) to 

be urged continuously into a retracted position when said 
handle member (316) is not being engaged by said occupant.
