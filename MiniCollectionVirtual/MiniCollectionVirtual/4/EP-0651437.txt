<ABSTRACT>
A plasma etch process is described for simultaneously removing photoresist and etch 
residues, such as silicon oxide residues, remaining on a substrate from a prior 

polysilicon and/or polycide etch. The process comprises: (a) generating radicals in 
a plasma generator upstream of an etch chamber, from an etch gas mixture 

comprising (i) oxygen, water vapor, or a mixture of same; and (ii) one or more 
fluorine-containing etchant gases; and (b) then contacting the substrate containing the 

photoresist and residues from the previous polysilicon/polycide etch with the 
generated radicals in the etch chamber to remove both the photoresist and the etch 

residues during the same etch step.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a plasma etch process for simultaneously removing 
photoresist and etch residues remaining from a prior polysilicon and/or polycide etch. In the construction of an integrated circuit structure on a substrate, etching of a 
masked polysilicon layer, for example, to form polysilicon lines on the structure, or 
the etching of a dual layer (polycide) structure comprising a metal silicide layer and 
a polysilicon layer to form dual layer lines on the integrated circuit structure, can 
result (in either case) in the formation of etch residues, such as, for example, sidewall 
deposits on the sidewalls of the polysilicon or metal silicide/polysilicon lines. For example, as shown in Figure 1, when a line 10 (which may comprise either a 
polysilicon line or a dual layer polycide line structure) is formed over a gate oxide 
layer 6 on a silicon semiconductor wafer 2, by patterning a photoresist layer to form 
a photoresist mask 14 and then anisotropically etching an underlying polysilicon 
and/or polycide layer through the mask, a residue 20a may form on the sidewalls of 
line 10, and a similar residue 20b may form on the sidewalls of photoresist mask 14. Such etch residues may, for example, comprise SiBrx or SiCly etch products or a 
silicon-rich oxide, SiOx. However, in any event, the residues must be removed from 
the integrated circuit structure, since they often interfere with the subsequent  
 
formation of other materials on the structure, due to their poor adherence and possible 
contamination of other materials. Conventionally, such etch residues have been removed by wet etching with dilute HF 
solutions. However, since HF will also attack gate oxide, monitoring of the wet etch 
is very important. In US-A-5,030,590 it is proposed to use a hydroxide wet etch 
instead of HF to reduce the damage to oxide portions of the structure. Subsequently, in US-A-5,228,950 it was proposed to substitute a dry etch process for 
the previously used wet etch processes. This patent teaches the use of an 
NF₃ plasma etch, to remove oxide-containing deposits, such as the residues shown in 
Figure 1, previously formed on the sidewalls of polysilicon lines and the sidewalls 
of the overlying photoresist during the etching of the polysilicon. The dry residue-removal 
etch process was conducted in the same chamber used for the polysilicon 
etch, i.e., before removal of the substrate to another chamber for removal of the 
photoresist. The above patent states that the NF₃ etchant gas may be used alone
