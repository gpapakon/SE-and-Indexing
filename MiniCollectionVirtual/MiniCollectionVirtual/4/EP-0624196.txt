<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides fibronectin self-assembly sites. The invention provides a set of polypeptides derived from the first type III repeat of fibronectin which contain a fibronectin-fibronectin binding site. These polypeptides have been used to obtain a second set of polypeptides derived from the C-terminal type I repeats which contain a second fibronectin-fibronectin binding site which interacts with the first type III repeat of fibronectin. These polypeptides are capable of inhibiting fibronectin matrix assembly by interfering with fibronectin-fibronectin binding. These polypeptides are also capable of enhancing fibronectin matrix assembly and inducing disulfide cross-linking of fibronectin molecules in vitro. In addition, these polypeptides are capable of inhibiting migration of tumor cells. The polypeptides of the present invention have a number of related uses as well.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fibronectin 
extracellular matrix assembly and compounds involved in 
extracellular matrix assembly. In particular, the present 
invention relates to methods of modulating fibronectin 
extracellular matrix assembly, and related biological 
effects. As a constituent of the extracellular matrix, 
fibronectin is important for allowing cells to attach to 
the matrix. Fibronectin influences both the growth and 
migration of cells. Normal fibroblasts in tissue culture 
secrete fibronectin and assemble it into a matrix that is 
essential to their adhesion and growth. While many 
tumorigenic cells continue to produce fibronectin, they do 
not assemble the fibronectin into a matrix. This lack of 
matrix assembly is thought to contribute to the invasive 
properties of malignant cells. Thus, one important stage 
in the progression of cancer may be the transition from 
assembly to non-assembly of the extracellular matrix.  
 The general structure of fibronectin has been 
identified. The polypeptide is composed of a number of 
repeats, of which there are three kinds, type I, type II, 
and type III. The type I repeat is about 45 amino acids 
long and makes up the amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal 
ends of the polypeptide. Two 60 amino acid type II 
segments interrupt a row of nine type I repeats at the 
amino-terminus of fibronectin. Finally, 15 to 17 type III 
segments, each about 90 amino acids long, make up the 
middle of the polypeptide. Altogether, mature or processed 
fibronectin contains nearly 2500 amino acid residues. Matrix assembly requires the binding of 
fibronectin to cell surfaces followed by assembly into 
fibrils, and stabilization of the fibrils by disulfide 
cross-linking. Several regions within fibronectin are 
required for the assembly process. The amino terminal 70 
kDa region of fibronectin is known to bind to another 
molecule, thought to be the amino terminus of another 
fibronectin molecule.(McKeown-Longo et al. J. Cell. Biol. 
100 364 (1985), Mosher et al. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci 614 167 
(1991). The fibronectin molecule may be characterized as 
containing both heparin-binding regions and gelatin-binding 
regions. Another region considered to be involved in the 
fibronectin assembly process is the amino terminal 29 kDa 
heparin binding domain. Cells have been shown to organize 
fibronectin fragments into fibrils only when heparin-binding 
fragments and an RGD-containing cell binding domain 
were present simultaneously (Woods et al., Exp. Cell Res.177:272-283
