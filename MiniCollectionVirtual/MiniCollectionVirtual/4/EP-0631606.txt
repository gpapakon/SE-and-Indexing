<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel hydroxyaromatic compounds. 
More particularly, this invention relates to novel 
poly(oxyalkylene) hydroxyaromatic ethers and their use in 
fuel compositions to prevent and control engine deposits. It is well known that automobile engines tend to form 
deposits on the surface of engine components, such as 
carburetor ports, throttle bodies, fuel injectors, intake 
ports and intake valves, due to the oxidation and 
polymerization of hydrocarbon fuel. These deposits, even 
when present in relatively minor amounts, often cause 
noticeable driveability problems, such as stalling and poor 
acceleration. Moreover, engine deposits can significantly 
increase an automobile's fuel consumption and production of 
exhaust pollutants. Therefore, the development of effective 
fuel detergents or "deposit control" additives to prevent or 
control such deposits is of considerable importance and 
numerous such materials are known in the art. For example, aliphatic hydrocarbon-substituted phenols are 
known to reduce engine deposits when used in fuel 
compositions. U.S. Patent No. 3,849,085, issued November 
19, 1974 to Kreuz et al., discloses a motor fuel composition 
comprising a mixture of hydrocarbons in the gasoline boiling 
range containing about 0.01 to 0.25 volume percent of a high 
molecular weight aliphatic hydrocarbon-substituted phenol in  
 
which the aliphatic hydrocarbon radical has an average 
molecular weight in the range of about 500 to 3,500. This 
patent teaches that gasoline compositions containing minor 
amount of an aliphatic hydrocarbon-substituted phenol not 
only prevent or inhibit the formation of intake valve and 
port deposits in a gasoline engine, but also enhance the 
performance of the fuel composition in engines designed to 
operate at higher operating temperatures with a minimum of 
decomposition and deposit formation in the manifold of the 
engine. Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 4,134,846, issued January 16, 
1979 to Machleder et al., discloses a fuel additive 
composition comprising a mixture of (1) the reaction product 
of an aliphatic hydrocarbon-substituted phenol, 
epichlorohydrin and a primary or secondary mono- or 
polyamine, and (2) a polyalkylene phenol. This patent 
teaches that such compositions show excellent carburetor, 
induction system and combustion chamber detergency and, in 
addition, provide effective rust inhibition when used in 
hydrocarbon fuels at low concentrations. Fuel additives containing a poly(oxyalkylene) moiety are 
also known in
