<ABSTRACT>
A unitary molded synthetic resin mounting member (45) is formed with a horizontal base (46) and a vertical partition wall (47). Front (48) and rear (53) external half-shells are detachably mounted on the base. The front half-shell is provided with an air inlet (50) and with an access panel (49) which houses a water receptacle (26). The rear half-shell is provided with upper and opposing side air outlets, and a pair of coverplates are provided for removable attachment over any of the air outlets. A handle (57) is provided in the rear external half-shell and is supported by an upper portion (59) of the partition wall. A detection device is provide to signal intermediate and maximum water levels in the water receptacle.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Title: Portable DehumidifierRelated Application:This application is a continuation-in-part of United States Patent Application Serial No. 07/817,940, filed January 8, 1992, now abandoned.Background of the Invention:The present invention relates generally to air conditioning apparatus and more particularly to electrically actuated dehumidifiers.Conventional dehumidifiers are equipped with relatively heavy operative components, such as an evaporator coil, a condenser, a compressor and a fan motor. Typically, these components are mounted upon internal support members and are surrounded by one or more external panels or shells. There are several shortcomings or drawbacks to the manner in which the functional components, internal supports and external coverings of dehumidifiers have been designed in the past. First, the support members were usually formed from a plurality of metal components which required considerableSUBSTITUTESHEET 

 assembly time, were subject to corrosion, were electrically conductive and permitted water to pass through gaps therebetween. The lack of unity in the internal support structure resulted in one or more of the internal support members being affixed to an exterior cover member. Upon removing the exterior cover member, the support member attached thereto, as well as any components carried by the support member, would separate from the other internal structures, thereby making it difficult to operate or test the various operative components when the exterior covers were removed. Also, previous support assemblies did not provide substantial separation between the water collecting components and the relatively high voltage components of the dehumidifier and thus did not reduce the possibility of electrical damage.During the dehumidifying process, ice collects on the evaporator fins and coils. Typically, the compressor is turned off before air flow through the evaporator is substantially impeded by the ice. A defrost cycle is provided wherein the fan is on, the compressor is off and relatively warm air passes through the evaporator to thaw the ice. In the past, the defrost cycle was initiated when the evaporator reached a selected low temperature, such as 27° F, and ended at a selected high temperature, such as 37° F. At that point, the compressor resumed operation, if the desired humidity level had not been reached. As a result, there was a tendency in high humidity environments for the compressorSUBSTITUTESHEET 

 to cycle on and off a great deal, thereby reducing the useful life

~"
 the evaporator, the fan and the fan motor, and an upper portion adapted to support the handle.
2. The dehumidifier according to Claim 1, and further characterized by the mounting member being unitarily molded from synthetic resin material.
3. The dehumidifier according to Claim 1, and further characterized by detection means adapted to generate a first signal-^€orres onding to an intermediate water level in the
SUBSTITUTESHEET 


 water receptacle and a second signal corresponding to a maximum water level in the water receptacle.
4. The dehumidifier according to Claim 1, and further characterized by clock means electrically connected to the circuit control means, said circuit control means being responsive to the temperature sensor and the clock means to continue operation of the compressor for a selected period of time after said temperature sensor reaches a selected low temperature.
5. The dehumidifier according to Claim 1, and further characterized by at least two substantially spaced apart air outlets provided on one of the exterior half-shells for exhausting the air in at least two substantially different directions.
6. The dehumidifier according to Claim 1, and further characterized by the water receptacle being formed with a restricted opening for receiving and discharging water.
7. The dehumidifier according to Claim 3, and further characterized by the detection means comprising a float assembly mounted in the water receptacle, an armature movably mounted on the partition wall and adapted to engage the float assembly, a plurality of magnets affixed to the armature and a—pair of sensors, each of said sensors being— leG-trically
SUBSTITUTESHEET 


connected to the circuit control means and adapted to generate a signal upon alignment of one of the magnets with said sensor.
8. The dehumidifier according to Claim 4, and further characterized by the selected period of time being at least 30 minutes.
