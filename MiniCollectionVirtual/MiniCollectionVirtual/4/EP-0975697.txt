<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thiazine indigo pigments, solid solutions thereof and to a process of
forming such pigments and solid solutions.Thiazine indigo compounds are an important series of pigments. Prior art processes for
forming these pigments involve the reaction of certain o-aminomercapto- carbocycles or
heterocycles with maleic acid or a derivative thereof in the presence of a solvent. The solvents
useful for this purpose were recognized to be either a carboxylic acid (which also acted to
catalyze the reaction) or an inert polar aprotic solvent.Thus in DE 2 151 723 a process is described for making certain symmetrically substituted
benzothiazine indigo compounds wherein certain substituted ortho-aminomercaptocarbocycles
or heterocycles are reacted with a maleic acid derivative in a carboxylic acid, e.g.
acetic acid. The pigments formed in this way are produced in good yield but they exhibit dull
shades. By symmetrically substituted is meant that there is identical substitution on each of
the thiazine rings.In DE OS 25 36 120 a process is described for making certain other symmetrically substituted
benzothiazine indigo compounds wherein certain substituted ortho-aminothiophenols are
reacted with a maleic acid derivative in an inert polar aprotic solvent. The benzothiazine
indigo compounds formed, allegedly display improved pigmentary properties, e.g. brighter
and cleaner shade over the compounds made in a carboxylic acid solution, however, they can
only be produced in poor yield.There remains a need to provide further thiazine indigo pigments and an improved process of
forming thiazine indigo pigments.It has now been found that new thiazine indigo pigments can be formed in high yield and
which exhibit pigmentary properties which are better than heretofore achieved. The invention provides in one of its aspects a pigment which is a compound according to the
formula (I)

wherein R1 and R2 are independently the atoms necessary to complete the formation of a
substituted or unsubstituted aromatic or aliphatic carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring system, the
radicals R3 und R4, independently of each other, are hydrogen or a group of the formulae (II), (III)
or (IV)

whereby in the formulae (II), (III) and (IV)
m, n und p,independently of each other, are zero or 1;XC1-14-alkylen or C2-8-alkenylen;Ya group -V-(CH2)q-;Za group -V-(CH2)r-;VC3-6-cycloalkylen;qa number of 1 to 6; andra number of zero to 6, R8 and R9independently of each other, signify hydrogen, C1-6-alkyl, C1-4-alkoxy,
