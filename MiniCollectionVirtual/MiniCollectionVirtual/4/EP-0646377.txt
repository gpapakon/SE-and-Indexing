<ABSTRACT>
Compositions comprising as immunising agent tumour 
cell-free extracts conjugated with albumins are 

disclosed. Compositions are used for the preparation of 
pharmaceutical compositions useful as immunostimulants 

in the therapy of cancer and/or immunodeficiency 
diseases of humans and animals. Compositions are also 

used for the preparation of antibodies in experimental 
animals, to be used for passive immunotherapy of humans 

and animals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions 
comprising tumour cell-free extracts conjugated with 
albumin proteins, suitable for use as immunogen in the 
therapy of cancer and/or immunodeficiency diseases of 
domestic, breeding animals and humans as well. The 
invention relates also to antibodies raised against 
said compositions for passive immunotherapy. Treatment of cancer affected patients by 
immunologic approaches is known from prior art. A non-specific 
stimulation of the immune system of such 
subjects with killed tumour cells has been obtained 
both in experimental animals and in humans. Killed 
leukemic cells have been injected into leukemic 
patients to get a specific immunogenic reaction to 
leukaemia. In the attempt to increase the immunogenicity 
potential, killed tumour cells have been linked to 
artificial haptens, i.e. trinitrophenol, or have been 
infected with virus, i.e. Vaccinia virus. The so-modified 
tumour cells have been successively used to 
induce an active immune response in animals with 
experimentally induced tumours (A.K. Abbas, A.L. 
Lichtman, and J.S. Pober "Cellular and Molecular 
Immunology" W.B. Saunders Co., Harcourt Brace 
Jovanovich, Inc. Philadelphia, 1991). Another approach has been to use soluble tumour 
antigen extracts prepared from tumours obtained by 
surgery or by autopsy. However, when inducing specific immunisation 
either with intact tumour cells or with cell-free 
soluble antigenic extracts, soluble antigens released 
by tumours in vivo, block an effective immune response,  
 
as a possible undesirable result of injecting exogen 
antigenic material (R.D. Guttmann et al. "Immunology" 
The Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, p. 129, Michigan, 1983). In any case no definitive results have been 
achieved in the field. Albumin proteins, i.e. bovine serum albumin, 
ovalbumin, rabbit serum albumin, are known from 
technical literature to exert high immunogenic 
properties, as carrier of haptens (E. Harlow and D. 
Lane, "Antibodies" Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New 
York, 1988). However no data have been reported on 
their ability to induce a specific antigenic anti-tumoral 
response, when conjugated to tumour cell-free 
extract components. It has been surprisingly found that cell-free 
extracts, either from human tumours of bioptic or 
autoptic origin or from tumours from experimental 
animals, show a remarkable immunogenic potential, after 
conjugation with suitable carriers, i.e. albumin 
proteins. The albumin-conjugated tumour cell-free 
extracts are able to stimulate the
