<ABSTRACT>
An optical article exhibits effects attributable to the nonlinear 
second order polarizability of electromagnetic radiation and comprises a polymer 

containing within its repeating units polar aligned noncentrosymmetric molecular 
dipoles having an electron donor moiety linked through a conjugated π bonding 

system to an electron acceptor moiety to permit oscillation of the molecular 
dipoles between a ground state exhibiting a first dipole moment and an excited 

state exhibiting a different dipole moment, characterized in that the molecular 
dipoles include as an acceptor moiety a vinyl group geminally substituted by two 

strong electron withdrawing groups, at least one of which is a perfluoroalkylsulfonyl 
moiety.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to optical articles that exhibit effects 
attributable to the polarization of electromagnetic radiation, and more particularly 
to optical articles that exhibit effects attributable to the nonlinear second order 
polarizability of electromagnetic radiation. The significant polarization components of a medium produced by 
contact with an electric field are first order polarization (linear polarization), 
second order polarization (first nonlinear polarization), and third order polarization 
(second nonlinear polarization). On a molecular level this can be expressed by 
Equation 1: 
P=αE+βE²+γE³ where
 
   P is the total induced polarization,
 
   E is the local electric field created by electromagnetic radiation, and
 
   α, β, and γ are the first, second, and third order polarizabilities, each of 
which is a function of molecular properties.
 
β and γ are also referred to as first and second hyperpolarizabilities, respectively. 
The molecular level terms of Equation 1 are first order or linear polarization αE, 
second order or first nonlinear polarization βE², and third order or second 
nonlinear polarization γE³. On a macromolecular level corresponding relationships can be 
expressed by Equation 2: 
P=χ(1)E+χ(2)E²⁺χ(3)E³ where
 
   P is the total induced polarization,
 
   E is the local electric field created by electromagnetic radiation, and
 
   χ(1), χ(2), and χ(3) are the first, second, and third order polarization 
susceptibilities of the electromagnetic radiation, and
 
 
χ(2) and χ(3) are also referred to as the first and second nonlinear polarization 
susceptibilities, respectively, of the transmission medium. The macromolecular 
level terms of Equation 2 are first order or linear polarization χ(1)E, second order 
or first nonlinear polarization χ(2)E², and third order or second nonlinear 
polarization χ(3)E³. To achieve on a macromolecular level second order polarization 
(χ(2)E²) of any significant magnitude, it is essential that the transmission medium 
exhibit second order (first nonlinear) polarization susceptibilities, χ(2), greater than 
10⁻⁹ electrostatic units (esu). To realize such values of χ(2) it is necessary that the 
first hyperpolarizability β be greater than 10⁻³⁰ esu. A significant difficulty encountered in finding suitable molecular 
dipoles for second order polarization effects lies in the molecular requirements that 
must be satisfied to achieve usefully large values of β. For a molecule to exhibit 
values of β greater than zero, it is necessary that
