<ABSTRACT>
An improved method is proposed for the preparation of a 
composite carbonate powder of lanthanum, cerium and terbium as 

a base material of a green-emitting phosphor for which the carbonate 
powder is desired to have a uniform particle size distribution 

and a particle configuration as close to spherical as possible. 
The improved method is characterized by two-step heat treatment 

of the carbonate slurry formed by the addition of, for example, ammonium 
hydrogen carbonate to a mixed aqueous solution of lanthanum, 

cerium and terbium nitrates each under specified conditions 
while the pH of the aqueous slurry is adjusted to 5.0 to 7.5 after 

the first step heat treatment but before the second step heat 
treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation 
of a coprecipitated carbonate of lanthanum, cerium and terbium. 
More particularly, the invention relates to a method for the preparation 
of a powder of a coprecipitated carbonate of lanthanum, cerium 
and terbium consisting of relatively uniform particles of a 
spheroidal particle configuration and suitable as a starting material 
of a green-emitting phosphor used in three-wavelength type 
fluorescent lamps. Rare earth-based green-emitting phosphors used in fluorescent 
lamps are prepared by converting a composite oxide of lanthanum, 
cerium and terbium into a composite phosphate by the dry-process 
high-temperature reaction with a reactive phosphate compound 
followed by a flux treatment of the composite rare earth-based 
phosphate. It is a requirement in the phosphor-preparing 
process in general that the powder of the phosphor has a particle 
size distribution as narrow as possible. In this regard, it is also 
desirable that the rare earth-based composite oxide of lanthanum, 
cerium and terbium as the starting material of the green-emitting 
phosphor has a narrow particle size distribution. Nevertheless, the 
particle size distribution of the composite oxide products of lanthanum, 
cerium and terbium produced by the manufacturers of  
 
rare earth-based products is not so narrow as desired by the phosphor 
manufacturers. As to the particle configuration, in addition, 
the products of the composite oxide of lanthanum, cerium and terbium 
as produced and supplied by the manufacturers of rare earth-based 
products mostly have a rod-like particle configuration and 
are far from spherical particles considered as ideal by the manufacturers 
of phosphors so that the phosphors produced therefrom 
also have a rod-like particle configuration. In order that a composite oxide of lanthanum, cerium and 
terbium has a narrow particle size distribution and a particle configuration 
as close to spherical as possible, the precursor of the 
composite oxide powder, which is a composite carbonate powder of 
lanthanum, cerium and terbium to be converted into the composite 
oxide by calcination, also should have a particle size distribution 
as narrow as possible and a particle configuration close to spherical. 
As is known, a rare earth-based composite carbonate of lanthanum, 
cerium and terbium is prepared by the method of coprecipitation 
in which an aqueous solution of inorganic acid salts, e.g., nitrates, 
of these rare earth elements in combination is
