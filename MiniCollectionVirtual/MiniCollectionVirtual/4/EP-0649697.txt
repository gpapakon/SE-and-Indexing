<ABSTRACT>
From the machining condition 
basic data (7) obtained experimentally, 

means (2) for creating a 

correlation graph (61) generates the 
data to be plotted on the correlation 

graph (61) which represents the 
correlation between the machining 

speed and precision according to the 
data (5) inputted for setting the machining 

condition, and displays the 
data thus generated on a display 

screen (31). Means (3) for controlling 
the instruction mark creates a 

graph cursor (62) displayed on the 
correlation graph (61) on the screen 

(31), and at the same time, shifts the 
graph cursor (62) to an instruction 

position designated by an input key 
(17) on the correlation graph (61). 

Means (1) for determining the actual 
machining condition determines the 

machining speed and precision from 
the instruction mark position (6) of 

the cursor (62) designated by the input 
key (17), and determines the actual 

machining condition such that 
the machining speed and precision 

can be achieved. The actual machining 
condition is determined in accordance 

with the basic data (7), set data 
(5), and the instruction mark position (6) of the graph cursor (62). This condition is displayed in the column (63) on 

the display screen (31). The operator can grasp the correlation between the machining speed and precision visually. 
As a result, even an inexperienced operator can set an optimal condition of an actual machining by a simple operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric 
discharge machine such as a wire electric discharge machine, 
an engraving electric discharge machine and the like, and 
more specifically, to an electric discharge machine for 
automatically setting machining conditions and a method of 
setting machining conditions of the electric discharge 
machine. Wire electric discharge machines and engraving 
electric discharge machines are able to machine metal molds 
and the like at high speed with pinpoint accuracy due to 
increased machining speed, improved machining accuracy and 
the like. To effect machining at high speed with pinpoint 
accuracy, it is a very important factor to set machining 
conditions. Nevertheless, machining conditions include many 
parameters and it needs a considerable amount of experience 
to optimally set the parameters, and only the limited 
number of experts can set the machining conditions. To solve the above problem, a machining condition 
setting method of an electric discharge machine, by which  
 
machining conditions can be automatically set, is put into 
practical use as disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent 
Examined Publication No. 5-21690 (1993). In the Publication, when a workpiece is to be 
machined in a plurality of machining processes, a desired 
machining can be effected very effectively by automatically 
creating a machining program for a series of machining 
processes in such a manner that an operator inputs 
machining condition data such as a kind of machining, 
electrode to be used, material of a workpiece, roughness of 
a finally finished surface, configuration and the like. In the above machining condition setting method of 
the electric discharge machine, the machining program is 
created based on the roughness of the finally finished 
surface given by the operator. By the way, the machining 
speed must be reduced to decrease the roughness of the 
finally finished surface. The operator knows the machining 
speed for the first time when the machining program is 
created. Thus, when the operator finds that a machining 
operation effected at the machining speed requires a time 
longer than he or she desires and the machining speed does 
not satisfy the requirement at the time, the operator 
automatically creates a machining program again by slightly 
increasing the roughness of a finally finished surface. Note, 
the relationship with the machining speed also arises in 
the same way when a dimensional accuracy is given as the 
machining conditions, in addition to
