<ABSTRACT>
Herbicidal compositions characterised in that they comprise, as active substance, a mixture comprising HERB 1, known under the chemical name of 1-CH3 3-[2-F-4-Cl-5-(-O-CH2-CO-O-C2H5)phenyl]-4-Cl-5-OCHF2-pyrazole (I) and a second herbicide (II) chosen from the group comprising diflufenican, bromoxynil, flurtamone, aclonifen and isoproturon.

-pyrazole,
and diflufenican (II).
Compositions according to claim 1, comprising a
synergistically active amount of a mixture comprising

HERB1 (I) and diflufenican (II).
Compositions according to claim 1, comprising a
ratio by weight of compound (I) to compound (II) between

0.04 and 0.5, preferably between 0.06 and 0.3.
Herbicidal compositions as claimed in one of
claims 1 to 3 containing 0.5 to 95 % of active

ingredients.
Process for treating crops with the intention of
protecting these crops against weeds and/or of improving

the yields, characterized in that an effective and non-phytotoxic
dose of a composition according to one of

claims 1 to 4 is applied to the leaves of the plants.
Process according to claim 5, in which herbicidal
compositions which comprise the active ingredients (I)

and (II) are applied to the surface to be treated, that
is to say to the surface which is infested, or susceptible

of being infested, with weeds, these active
ingredients being applied at a dose of 3 to 25 g/ha in

the case of active ingredient (I) (that is to say
herbicide HERB1), preferably of 5 to 15 g/ha, and at the

dose of 30 to 150 g/ha, preferably between 50 and
100 g/ha, in the case of diflufenican. 
Process according to one of claims 5 or 6, in
which a wheat, barley, oat or rye crop is treated.
