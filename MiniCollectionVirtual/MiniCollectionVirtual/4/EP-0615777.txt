<ABSTRACT>
For the catalytic reduction of NOx in oxygen-containing exhaust gases (18), solid urea (12) is used as reducing agent instead of an aqueous urea solution. Significant advantages result from this, especially for mobile use. The catalyst system used is a combination of urea hydrolysis and SCR catalyst (34, 5).

Process for selective catalytic NO
x
 reduction in gases (18) containing water 
vapour and oxygen using urea (12) as the reducing agent and an NO
x
 reducing 
catalytic converter (5) whereby the urea (12) is, prior to contact with the reducing 

catalytic converter (5), hydrolysed quantitatively to NH
3
 and CO
2
 at a hydrolysis 
catalytic converter (34), characterised in that urea (12) is metered into the gas 

(18) as solid matter in the form of microprills with a diameter of 10 - 1000 Âµm and 
applied direct to the hydrolysis catalytic converter (34).
