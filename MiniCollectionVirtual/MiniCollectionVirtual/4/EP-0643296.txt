<ABSTRACT>
A machine for inspecting a container has an 
inspection conveyor for gripping and conveying 

containers delivered thereto at one speed. A feed 
conveyor delivers containers to the inspection 

conveyor at a slower speed. A container sensed on 
the inspection conveyor is brought to a stop at a 

selected location so that an inspection can take 
place.

<DESCRIPTION>
Glass bottles are conventionally formed in an
individual section (I.S.) machine. The formed bottles are
then placed on a conveyor for routing through a number of
inspection stations where they will be stopped so that an
inspection can be performed.Non round bottles pose special problems since they are
difficult to spin about the axis of the finish (the threaded
opening) and relative rotation between the finish and a
check detector about this axis is conventionally required to
find checks (a closed crack where the neck of the bottle
joins the shoulder or on the finish or inside the finish).
For example, Hungarian Patent No. 201,154 discloses a check
detector wherein a non round bottle to be inspected is
stopped at an inspection station by a Geneva mechanism which
elevates the stopped bottle into a rotating check inspection
head.It is conventional to hold a round bottle at the
inspection station while rotating it about its vertical axis
so that an inspection operation can be conducted. U.S.
Patent Nos. 3,901,381 and 4,865,447 disclose such an
inspection station where the finish of a spinning bottle is
inspected for checks and the like and U.S. Patent No.
5,028,769 discloses such an inspection station where the
mold code located on the heel of the spinning bottle is
inspected (read).European Patent Application 0,186,278 discloses a
machine for inspecting a vertically standing container which
is carried on a feed conveyor through a first inspection
station and then through a second inspection station.
Interposed between the inspection stations are two belts 
which engage the container as it is carried between the two
inspection stations and which are driven at different speeds
appropriate to cause the container to rotate through 90°.It is an object of the present invention to provide an
improved glass container inspection machine which delivers a
bottle to an inspection station and momentarily stops the
bottle so that an inspection can take place.The present invention provides a machine for inspecting
a vertically standing container at a selected inspection
station comprising an inspection conveyor including a pair
of belt conveyors having spaced opposed parallel portions
for gripping and conveying containers delivered there to
means for driving said belt conveyors forward at a
speed S2a feed conveyor for delivering containers to said
inspection conveyor at a second, slower, speed S1
   characterised in that the machine comprises
means for sensing when a container being conveyed by
said inspection conveyor
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A machine for inspecting a vertically standing
container at a selected inspection station comprising an

inspection conveyor (14) including a pair of belt conveyors
(16) having spaced opposed parallel portions for gripping

and conveying containers delivered there to

means (18) for driving said belt conveyors forward at
a speed S2
a feed conveyor (12) for delivering containers to said
inspection conveyor (14) at a second, slower, speed S1

   characterised in that the machine comprises

means (20) for sensing when a container (10) being
conveyed by said inspection conveyor (14) is at a selected

location
means (C) for controlling the operation of the means
(18) for driving said belt conveyors upon operation of the

sensing means (20) to cause the controlling means (C) to
follow a predefined program which stops forward displacement

of the container at the inspection station
means (S) for determining whether the container is
rotated at the inspection station or is not so rotated
and means (31,28,22) for inspecting the container at
the inspection station.
A machine according to claim 1, characterised in that
said inspection means comprises a check detector (31).
A machine according to claim 2 wherein said check
detector comprises a rotatable check detector ring (82),

including at least one inspection device (28) extending
downwardly below the top of a container to be inspected,

characterised by

means (C) for stopping the rotation of said check
detector ring in at least one selected orientation whereat a 

path exists for a container to be conveyed to and from said
inspection station by said inspection conveyor, without

striking said at least one inspection device, and
means (C) for rotating said check detector ring and
stopping said check detector ring at said selected

orientation, while a container is stopped at said inspection
station, so that an inspection for a check can be completed.
A machine according to claim 3, further characterised
by

   means (C) for driving said belt conveyors forwardly at
said selected speed to remove the inspected container from

said inspection station.
A machine according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that said inspection means comprises a

mould number reader.
A machine according to claim 1, characterised in that
each of said belt conveyors (16) comprises upper and lower

belts.
