<ABSTRACT>
Process for making objects from expanded polystyrene, starting from EPS blocks or sheets (10) which are rigid by reason of their thickness, characterised in that the said sheets are cut into their thickness (E) so as to make, near one their facing surfaces (11), at least one recess (20) of small thickness extending substantially parallel to the said facing surface and at least one hollow (21) existing between the said recess (20) and the other facing surface on which this hollow emerges. Figure 1A. The invention applies mainly to the fields of insulation and packaging.
