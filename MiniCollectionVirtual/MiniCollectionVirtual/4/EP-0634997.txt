<DESCRIPTION>
 PREPARATION OP SUBSTITUTED GUANIDINESFIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to chemical synthetic methods for preparing various substituted guanidines from cyanamide derivatives and ammonia or amine derivatives.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Substituted guanidines have a wide field of use. For example, 1,3-diphenyl guanidines and like substituted guanidines are accelerators for the vulcanization of rubbers. Thus, such guanidine derivatives, when radiolabeled, can be incorporated into a vulcanized rubber object (e.g. , a tire tread) and rate of loss of rubber therefrom by water can be monitored by rate of loss of radioactivity. As another example, l,3-di-(o- tolyl) guanidine may act in an agonistic, antagonistic or inverse agonistic manner in relation to the prototypical sigma benzomorphans and therefore can affect pupil size and heart rate in a direction parallel or opposite that caused by benzomorphans which can be determined by standard tests in laboratory animals. See U.S. Patent No. 4,709,094, which is incorporated herein by reference.Similarly, certain tri- and tetra-substituted guanidines, e.g., N-(l-naphthyl)-N'-(3-ethylphenyl)-N'- methyl guanidine, also exhibit exceptionally low binding to the sigma brain receptor. Such compounds can thus be used for treating diseases of the nervous system in which the pathophysiology of the diseases involves excessive excitation of nerve cells by agonists of the glutamate/N- methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor. See U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/663,134, also incorporated herein by reference. 

 The synthesis of substituted guanidines by reaction of ammonia or amine derivatives with cyanamide derivatives is a well-known reaction. Symmetrical or unsymmetrical N,N'-disubstituted guanidines can be conveniently made by reaction of an appropriate amine with an appropriate cyanamide either by fusion or in a suitable boiling solvent such as chlorobenzene. Safir, S.R. et al. J. Org. Chem. 13: 924 (1948); Gulek, H. . et al. J. Med. Chem. 12:712 (1969). For example, see Reaction (I) set forth below in which each R1 and R2 is aryl or alkyl.NH-HCl solvent R1 [| R2R^N^-HCl + R2-NHCN > / \Nκ (I) Δ H HHowever, preparation of tri- or tetra-substituted guanidines using the same reaction is limited by the lower nucleophilicity of the secondary amines or inversely lower electrophilicity of the substituted cyana ides. Indeed, the reaction of a secondary amine and disubstituted cyanamide is a very low yield synthesis (0-20%) of substituted guanidine even under forcing
