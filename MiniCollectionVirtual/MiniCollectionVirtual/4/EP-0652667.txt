<ABSTRACT>
A switched carrier modulation simulator is provided which permits 
facsimile communications to be coupled by modems utilizing constant carrier 

modulation. In the transmit direction, the simulator detects control signals from a 
facsimile terminal device and inserts predetermined signals before and after each 

outgoing facsimile communication. In the receive direction, the simulator detects 
the presence of the predetermined signals in the incoming communications and 

couples control signals to the facsimile terminal device to ensure half duplex 
transmission.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to modems used for facsimile 
communications and, more particularly, to a technique for transmitting such 
communications via continuous carrier modulation. For purposes of this application, the term "data" will refer to 
communications coupled through the telephone network via a modem other than 
facsimile messages and their associated control signals. Data communications are typically in accordance with an internationally 
recognized standard, such as those promulgated by the C.C.I.T.T. For example, a 
large number of modems produced by different manufacturers conform to the "V.32" 
C.C.I.T.T. standard. This standard governs full duplex 9600 baud data transmission. 
While the current trend for data communications is full duplex operation, an earlier 
data standard, i.e., the V.13 standard for data communications, includes a provision 
for simulating half-duplex operation. In particular, a predetermined sequence 
is inserted before and after each data communication. Facsimile communications generally conform to another collection of 
standards, such as V.17, V.21, V.27, and V.29. All modems compatible with these 
standards operate in a half-duplex manner and the exchange of signals between 
facsimile devices is well-defined. It should be noted that, historically, the standards and techniques for 
facsimile communications evolved independently of those for data communications. 
It is not surprising, therefore, that the standards and techniques adopted for facsimile 
are very dissimilar from those for data communications. A modem can be classified into one of two general types depending on 
its modulation arrangement. In constant carrier modulation, such as specified in the 
V.32 standard, carrier signal energy is continuously transmitted by each modem. In 
switched carrier modulation, a modem's carrier signal is switched off when the 
modem is not transmitting a facsimile communication. The presence or absence of 
incoming carrier signal energy is tracked by apparatus within the modem and a 
control signal, designated as "carrier detect" (CD) is provided. The ubiquitous 
Group 3 facsimile devices utilize the CD control signal and transmit signals 
only in the absence of incoming carrier signal energy.  While the current arrangements operate satisfactorily, it would be highly 
desirable if a technique were developed which permits a modem utilizing constant 
carrier modulation to be used for facsimile communications. This desire is 
heightened by the recent modems which
