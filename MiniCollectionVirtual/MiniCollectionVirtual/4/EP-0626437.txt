<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to storage 
phosphors which are useful in X-ray imaging plates. Phosphor materials have been used in the 
past, in a variety of forms, to help in alleviating the 
exposure of patients to X-rays during X-radiation 
diagnoses. Storage phosphors, or photostimulable 
phosphors, have the ability to store some of the X-ray 
energy and emit longer wavelength radiation when 
exposed to (excited by) visible light, infrared rays, 
heat, and so forth. The secondary excitation needed to 
cause the emission of longer wavelength radiation in 
storage phosphors is commonly referred to as 
stimulation radiation. Storage phosphors are typically 
used in imaging plates to acquire images in a digital 
format and to produce images which may be 
electronically displayed on a CRT, or printed to a 
suitable hardcopy medium such as photographic film. 
Typically, in such imaging plates, the storage 
phosphors are incorporated into a binder which is 
applied to a suitable support, such as polyethylene 
terephthalate (PET), and a protective overcoat material 
is applied over the phosphor containing binder layer. When ionizing radiations such as X-rays or 
Gamma rays are used for imaging human bodies it is 
desirable that the photostimulable phosphors employed 
in imaging plates emit light at as high a luminescence 
intensity as possible due to exposure to stimulating 
radiation after exposure to ionizing radiation so that 
the dose of ionizing radiations to which the body must 
be exposed can be reduced. Of the many different and 
photostimulable phosphor compositions known, many fail 
to satisfy the practical demands of medical imaging 
applications by failing to generate sufficient or  
 
photostimulated emission intensity for the desired 
radiation dose. It is therefore desirable to identify 
storage phosphors which are capable of producing high 
photostimulated emission intensities. It would also be desirable to identify useful 
phosphor hosts having relatively high densities, since, 
theoretically, for phosphors which have higher 
densities, thinner phosphor layers could be utilized, 
resulting in increased resolution. One very popular 
storage phosphor, BaFBr, has a relatively low density 
of about 4.96 g/cc. Phosphors typically consist of a host 
compound, which is often combined with a small amount 
of an activator element to change the hue and/or 
improve the efficiency of fluorescence. US-A-4,959,174; US-A-4,829,188; and US-A-4,857,741 
disclose phosphors in which gadolinium may be 
combined
