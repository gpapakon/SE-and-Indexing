<ABSTRACT>
A disk holder table has a bottom surface to which 
a holder ring for holding a drive roller is assembled. 

The holder ring is made of metal and has a generally 
rectangular shape. The holder ring is engaged by hooks 

formed on the bottom surface of the disk holder table. 
The disk holder table has guide portions formed on the 

bottom surface thereof to restrict the range of rotation 
of the holder ring in parallel to the bottom surface. 

The holder ring is urged in a predetermined direction by 
a rod spring formed on the bottom surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a disk driver having a
disk holder table for holding a disk such as a magnetic
disk and for rotating the disk.A conventional disk driver has a disk holder
table comprising a disk-shaped plastic magnet integrally
coupled to a motor shaft fixedly inserted in the center
portion of the plastic magnet. A support member is
rotatably attached to the bottom surface of the disk
holder table by the use of a support pin. The support
member is urged by a rod spring outwardly from the center
of the disk holder table. The support member has a free
end to which a drive roller is rotatably attached through
a roller shaft. The drive roller is mounted on the
support member in such a manner that the drive roller is
upwardly protruded through an aperture formed in the disk
holder table.However, in the above-mentioned conventional disk
driver, the support member for holding the drive roller
is attached to the bottom surface of the disk holder
table by the use of the support pin. With this
structure, the number of parts is inevitably increased. 
In addition, in order to attach the support member to the disk holder table,
it is required to caulk the top end of the support pin on the top surface of
the disk holder table. This results in increase of the number of assembling
steps.DE 35 23 515 discloses a disc holder table in which a drive roller is
mounted on a holder. The drive roller projects through a triangular or oval
opening in the table, and the holder is mounted on a shaft which connects
the table and a motor.US 5,151,836 discloses a disc holder substantially similar to the first-mentioned
conventional disc holder table.It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a disk driver which
is capable of effectively reducing the number of parts and the number of
assembling steps.Accordingly, the present invention provides a disc driver comprising
a rotary table for receiving a disc on one surface thereof, a drive roller
adapted to project through the table at a position eccentric from the axis of
the table, the drive roller being mounted on a holder which is slidably
mounted on the other surface of the table for linear movement parallel to the
table by means also permitting limited rotation of the holder about an axis
parallel to the axis of the table, and resilient means biasing the holder for
said linear movement in one sense thereof, characterised in that the holder
is formed with at least two parallel edges and held by at least two hooks,
each of said at least two hooks engaging with one

<CLAIMS>
A disc driver comprising a rotary table (20) for receiving a disc on one
surface thereof, a drive roller (25) adapted to project through the table (20)

at a position eccentric from the axis of the table (20), the drive roller (25)
being mounted on a holder (22) which is slidably mounted on the other

surface of the table (20) for linear movement parallel to the table (20) by
means also permitting limited rotation of the holder (22) about an axis

parallel to the axis of the table (20), and resilient means (23) biasing the
holder (22) for said linear movement in one sense thereof, characterised in

that the holder (22) is formed with at least two parallel edges and held by
at least two hooks (20-2), each of said at least two hooks (20-2) engaging

with one of said at least two parallel edges whereby to retain the holder (22)
whilst permitting said sliding and limited rotation.
A disk driver according to Claim 1, wherein the rotary table (20)
comprises a plastic magnet.
A disk driver according to any preceding claim, wherein the rotary
table (20) comprises a disk holder table (20) for holding a disk having a disk

hub made of metal and provided with a driving hole formed at a position
eccentric with the center of the disk to receive the drive roller (25) therein,

wherein said disk holder table (20) is provided with an aperture (20-1)
formed at a position eccentric with the center thereof, wherein said holder

(22) is a holder ring (22) having a generally rectangular shape, said other
surface being the bottom surface of said disk holder table (20) to which said

holder ring (22) is assembled to hold said drive roller (25) so that said drive
roller (25) is upwardly projected through said aperture (20-1), said holder

ring (22) being engaged by said at least two hooks (20-2), the hooks (20-2)
being formed on the bottom surface of said disk holder table (20) with a

space left between said holder ring (22) and the bottom surface of said disk 
holder table (20), said holder ring (22) being urged in a predetermined

direction by said resilient means (23), said resilient means (23) being placed
on the bottom surface of said disk holder table (20).
A disk driver as claimed in Claim 3, wherein said drive roller (25) is
mounted on one side (22A) of said holder ring (22), said holder ring (22)

being engaged through said at least two hooks (20-2) with said edges, said
edges being peripheral edges of two adjacent sides (22B,22C) of said holder

ring (22) adjacent to said one side (22A), said holder ring (22) having a
protrusion (22-2) which is formed at a peripheral edge of an opposite side

(22D) of said holder ring (22) opposite to said one side (22A) to protrude
