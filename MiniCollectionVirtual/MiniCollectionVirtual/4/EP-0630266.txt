<ABSTRACT>
A method for disinfecting non-peat based plant-growth media, especially coir, which does not leave phytotoxic residues in the medium by contacting the medium with one or more water-soluble peroxygens is disclosed. The water-soluble peroxygen is preferably selected from the group comprising hydrogen peroxide and organic peracids, especially peracetic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Disinfecting MethodThis invention concerns a method for disinfecting. More specifically, the invention concerns a method for disinfecting peat-substitute growth media. Still more specifically, the invention concerns a method for disinfecting coir. The use of peat as a growth medium for plants has been a mainstay of British horticulture for many years. However, the extraction of peat from peat bogs has come under increasing pressure from environmental groups who are concerned for the loss of these ecosystems. This has lead to a search for alternative growth media which is more environmentally acceptable. One alternative is to use coir, a waste by-product from the processing of coconuts which has hitherto been stored in large waste dumps in regions where coconuts are processed, eg. Sri Lanka. â€”Coir is compacted into bricks to reduce its volume for transport. The bricks are then disintegrated to the constituent dust by use of an appropriate mill. The coir at this stage often contains about 15% by weight of water. Before sale as a plant growth medium, the coir is usually hydrated to about 70% by contacting the coir with water. 90% of the total hydration occurs within a few minutes of contact with the water, the hydration being completed while the coir is stored for approximately 24 hours. The fully hydrated coir is then available for sale.As the coir in the dumps has usually been stored in the open in tropical climates for a long time, often for many years, there is a danger that the coir may be contaminated by, for example, faecal matter which may contain harmful microorganisms, especially coiiform bacteria. These microorganisms are potentially harmful both to plants grown in the coir and also to those handling the material, especially where there is intimate contact between the 

 material and eg. the hands of a user as would be the case in normal gardening and horticultural activities. It is therefore expedient that the coir is disinfected to ameliorate these risks.However, many common disinfectants when employed at effective concentrations leave residuals or toxic by-products in a growth medium such as coir which are phytotoxic to seeds or plants, for example methyl bromide or active chlorine compounds.Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for disinfecting coir. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for disinfecting coir which ameliorates or eliminates the disadvantages of alternative disinfectants for coir that is intended as a plant

Claims
1. A method for disinfecting coir characterised in that it comprises contacting the coir with one or more water-soluble peroxygen compounds.
2. A method for disinfecting coir, characterised in that it comprises contacting the coir with a composition comprising one or more water- soluble peroxygens in an amount that is sufficient to substantially disinfect the coir without leaving a phytotoxic residue therein, thereby enabling the disinfected coir to be used as a plant growth medium.
3. A method according to claims 1 or 2, wherein the water-soluble peroxygen is in the form of an aqueous solution.
4. A method according to claim 3, wherein the aqueous solution is utilised to hydrate the coir.
5. A method according to claims 3 or 4, wherein the water-soluble peroxygen is incorporated into the aqueous solution at a concentration selected in the range from about 0.001 % to about 5% by weight.
6. A method according to claim 5, wherein the water-soluble peroxygens comprise from about 0.01 % to about 0.5% by weight of the aqueous solution.
7. A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the water soluble peroxygens are selected from the group comprising hydrogen peroxide and organic peracids.
8. A method according to claim 7, wherein the water soluble peroxygen comprises peracetic acid, optionally in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.
9. Any novel method as disclosed herein with reference to any one of Examples E2 to E6.
10. Coir which is disinfected by a method according to any preceding claim. 


Any novel method for disinfecting coir substantially as described herein with respect to any novel feature or combination of features, or coir whenever so disinfected.
