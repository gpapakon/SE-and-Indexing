<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a graft-modified 
polyolefin resin composition and thermoplastic resin 
compositions containing it. More particularly, it relates 
to resin compositions which are improved in e.g. mechanical properties, 
adhesiveness, dyeability and paintability and which are low in 
the degree of coloring and less costly. Polyolefin resins are excellent in mechanical 
properties, chemical properties, physical properties and 
moldability, and are widely in use as a cheap plastic 
material. However, polyolefin resins are low in affinity with 
metals, glass, polar high molecular materials because of 
their nonpolarity, and thus, compositions with these 
materials are difficult. Meanwhile, however, efforts have been made for 
improvement of the chemical properties such as adhesiveness, 
paintability and printability through addition of 
functional groups to a polypropylene resin, and new methods 
have been proposed for graft-polymerization of maleic acid 
anhydride or unsaturated compounds having glycidyl groups 
for improvement of compatibility with other polymers in the 
presence of a radical polymerization initiator (for example,  
 
JP-B-290418/91). By such conventional methods, however, it is 
difficult to achieve uniform grafting of such compounds onto 
polyolefin resins, this resulting in insufficient 
compatibility between polymers at the interface, thus 
leading to unfavorable balance with regard to mechanical 
properties, when they are used together. While unmodified 
polyolefin resins are colorless, modified polyolefin resins 
are yellowish except under specific producing conditions, 
this being unfavorable when the modified polyolefins are 
used alone as products. Even when they are used in 
combination with other polymers as products, their yellowish 
shade is not preferable in appearance especially when they 
are white or transparent thermoplastic resins. Further, the compounds having functional groups 
incorporated for improvement of such drawbacks are 
expensive, this leading to loss of the cost advantage of 
polyolefin resins known as cheap plastic materials. Furthermore, although in 
JP-A-83110/88 it is described that polystyrene 
resin compositions obtainable when styrene monomer and 
epoxy monomer are impregnated in olefin polymers or diene 
rubbers in an aqueous suspension are used as a 
dispersibility-improver for other kinds of resins, it is 
difficult that such resin compositions are capable of  
 
providing excellent and well-balanced mechanical properties. An
