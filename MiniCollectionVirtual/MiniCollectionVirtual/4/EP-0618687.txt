<ABSTRACT>
A radio receiver apparatus receives a transmission 
signal on the basis of a reference pattern put in the 

transmission signal at a predetermined timing and is 
composed of a receiving unit, a received data processing 

unit and a first and a second phase shift information 
detection unit. The receiving unit demodulates the 

transmission signal to output received data. The received 
data processing unit performs data processing the received 

data synchronized with the received data on the basis of 
the reference pattern formed of a predetermined bit 

pattern. The first phase shift information detection unit 
detects the first phase shift information of the received 

data corresponding to the data processing of the received 
data processing unit on the basis of the reference pattern. 

The second phase shift information detection unit generates 
the state where phase of the received data is shifted so as 

to detect the second phase shift information of the 
received data corresponding to the data processing of the 

data processing unit. The radio receiver apparatus 
corrects phase shift of the received data based on the 

compared result of output signal from the first phase shift 
detection unit and the second phase shift detection unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a radio receiver
apparatus and more particularly, to a method for phase
correction thereof.Conventionally, in a digital cellular system
being one type of radio telephone, a voice signal is
transmitted and received in a coded manner so that a
channel can be used simultaneously by a plurality of
terminal devices by applying the technique of time-division
multiplex.When power is made, a terminal device of this
type sequentially scans 124 channels previously set to
detect a channel at which the electric field strength is
most intense.The terminal device thereby detects a BCCH
(broadcast control channel) assigned to an area to which
the terminal device belongs and receives such BCCH. The BCCH has time slots through which various
information are transmitted. In the digital cellular
system BCCH each terminal device receives BCCH so as to
transmit information from the base station which
transmits the BCCH, information on neighboring base
stations and access information of terminal devices.Thus, the terminal device detects an FCCH
(frequency correction channel) which is included within
the BCCH at a predetermined timing, to thereby
generally detect a timing at which the necessary
information is transmitted on the basis of the FCCH.The FCCH is a synchronizing signal to which a bit
pattern is assigned so that, data of the value "1"
continues for a predetermined number of bits when
demodulated. The terminal device detects timing of the
FCCH to synchronize, i.e., frame synchronize, its
overall operation with the timing of a received data S.Further, upon attaining frame synchronization by
the FCCH in this manner, the terminal device
synchronizes its overall operation with bursts.Here, a burst is output onto the BCCH at a
predetermined timing and, as shown in Fig. 1, a
training sequence is put in at substantially the center
thereof. The training sequence is formed by repeating 
data of value "1" and value "0" in a previously set bit
pattern, whereas the FCCH is formed by assigning a bit
pattern so that data of value "1" continues for a
predetermined number of bits.This type of digital cellular system generally
synchronize its overall operation with the received
data on the basis of the FCCH, and synchronize the
overall operation by bit on the basis of the training
sequence.In particular, by detecting a correlation between
a predetermined bit pattern and a received data, the
terminal device detects a timing at which the
correlation value rises so as to detect the timing of a
training sequence.
