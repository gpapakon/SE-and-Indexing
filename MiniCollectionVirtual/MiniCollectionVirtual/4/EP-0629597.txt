<ABSTRACT>
The method described relates to the treatment of drinking-water pipes whose internal surfaces consist at least partially of fresh cement mortar, and provides for the pipe (1) to be exposed to a gas mixture containing carbon dioxide in a concentration above the normal atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. This concentration is in the range of 5 - 95 % by volume. The duration of the treatment is less than 24 hours and preferably 1 - 6 hours. Using the novel method, the pipes are ready to use within a very short time, which is particularly advantageous in the restoration of pipes in situ by means of a subsequently applied cement mortar lining, so that the previously required flushing of the pipe, which is costly and time consuming, can be omitted. Preferably, the treatment of the pipe is commenced within less than 24 hours and preferably within 5 - 10 hours of the application of the lining.
