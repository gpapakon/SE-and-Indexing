<ABSTRACT>
Identification codes comprising consecutive 
numbers are assigned to all disc holding grooves of a 

magazine. A memory 202 of a microcomputer 200 has a 
first storage area for storing the identification code 

of the magazine groove 31 positioned as opposed to a 
disc insertion-discharge portion 4 or playing p
ortion 
9, and a second storage area for storing the identification 

code of the groove 31 accommodating the disc 
to be played. The direction of rotation of the 

magazine is determined by an arithmetic procedure based 
on the two identification codes stored in the first and 

second storage areas and on the difference in position 
between the insertion-discharge portion 4 and the 

playing portion 9 around the center of the magazine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control
system for disc playing devices for accommodating
a plurality of disclike recording media (hereinafter
referred to as "discs") having data recorded thereon
to play the desired disc, or to take out the disc to
outside and replace the disc by another one.Disc playing devices of such type are
proposed which include the one shown in FIGS. 71 and
72 and comprising a disc magazine 610 rotatably 
mounted on a base chassis 600. The device has two
playing portions 630, 630 and a single inlet-outlet
portion 620 which are arranged outside the path of
rotation of the magazine 610 (Unexamined Japanese
Patent Publication HEI 4-57248).The magazine 610 has grooves 611, 614 formed
along the outer periphery in its bottom and top,
respectively, and extending radially toward the
center of rotation. Discs D can be accommodated in
an upright position in the magazine 610, each with its
lower and upper end portions fitted in the grooves 611,
614.The lower grooved portion 611 is formed at
its outer end with a cutout 612, in which a plate
spring 613 is provided as partly projected outward
therefrom.The inlet-outlet portion 620 is provided
with a kick-out arm 621 pivotally movable in a vertical
plane for kicking out the disc from the magazine 610.
Each of the playing portions 630, 630 has a kick-out
arm 631 for kicking out the disc D to a playing set
position 633 and a kick-in arm 632 for kicking the disc
D from the playing set position 633 into the magazine
610, these arms 631, 632 being each pivotally movable
in a vertical plane. When the disc D is pushed into the magazine
610 from outside the inlet-outlet portion 620, the
disc D is inserted into the magazine 610 by being
guided by the grooves 611, 614. In the course of
insertion, the disc D moves over the plate spring 613
by depressing the spring, whereupon the spring 613
resiliently restores itself to prevent the disc D from
jumping out inadvertently.When a particular disc selected by the user
is to be played, the magazine 610 rotates to position
the selected disc as opposed to the empty one of the
playing portions 630, 630, and the disc D is kicked
out by the kick-out arm 631 to the playing position 633
of the playing portion 630.On completion of playing of the disc D, the
disc is kicked to the original position within the
magazine 610 by the kick-in arm 632.With the disc playing device described,
however, the disc, when set in the playing portion 630,
is positioned as completely removed from the disc
magazine 610. This entails the

<CLAIMS>
A control system for controlling the operation of a
disk playing device comprising:


a rotatable magazine (3) having a plurality of disc
holding grooves (31), the grooves (31) being formed

generally radially around a central axis,
a mechanism for drivingly rotating the magazine (3),
disc insertion-discharge means (4) and playing means
(9) which are provided alongside the path of rotation of

the magazine (3) and arranged away from each other,
a first delivery device (6) for transferring discs
between the disc insertion-discharge means (4) and the

magazine (3),
a second delivery device (6a) for transferring discs
between the playing means (9) and the magazine (3),

   the control system being 
characterized
 in that

the system comprises an openable and closable door (41)
provided for the disc insertion-discharge means (4), formed

in a vertically elongated hollow cylinder with a vertically
elongated slit (42) for the disc to pass therethrough, and

rotated by a motor (M1) between a first position which
allows the disc to pass through the slit and a second

position which does not allow the disc to pass through the
slit,
means for detecting closing of the door (41), and
means for permitting rotation of the magazine (3) only
when closing of the door (41) has been detected by the door

closing detecting means.
A control system as defined in claim 1 which comprises:

memory means for storing data as to the presence or
absence of the disc in each of the disc holding grooves

(31),
input means to be manipulated by the user to specify a
desired disc holding groove (31) when the disc is to be

loaded into the groove (31) or to be discharged from the
groove (31) through the door (41),
magazine rotation control means for rotating the
magazine (3) until the disc holding groove (31) specified

by manipulating the input means is positioned as opposed to
the disc insertion-discharge means (4),
door operating means for opening the door (4) in
response to a manipulation signal from the input means, and
disc discharging means for checking whether the disc is

the input means with reference to the data stored in the
memory means and discharging the disc to the disc

insertion-discharge means (4) by controlling the first

specified groove (31).
A control system as defined in claim 2 which comprises
flag means for indicating cessation of rotation of the

magazine (3) and wherein the door operating means opens the
door (41) after recognizing cessation of rotation of the

magazine (3) with reference to the flag means.
A control system as defined in claim 3 which comprises:

timer means for measuring a predetermined period of
time after the door (41) is opened,
