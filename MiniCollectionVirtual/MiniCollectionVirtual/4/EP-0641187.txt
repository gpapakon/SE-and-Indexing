<DESCRIPTION>
Compositions of various types have incorporated within them 
components which provide cooling sensation to mucosal membranes and/or 
to skin. Such compositions include toothpastes, mouthwashes, 
perfumes, lotions, shaving cream, post shaving preparations, shampoos, 
antiperspirants, deodorants, beverages, chewing gum, tobacco products, 
and pharmaceutical products among many others. It is well established that the "cooling" effect of menthol is a 
physiological effect due to the direct action of menthol on the nerve 
endings of the human body responsive for the detection of hot or cold 
and is not due to latent heat of evaporation. It is believed that the 
menthol acts as a direct stimulus on the cold receptors at the nerve 
endings which in turn stimulate the central nervous system. Although menthol is well established as a physiological coolant 
its use alone, in some compositions, is limited by its strong minty 
odor and its relative volatility. Several other compounds have been reported in the technical 
literature as having an odor or flavor similar to menthol and from 
time to time have been proposed as flavorants or odorants in a variety 
of topical and ingestible compositions. For example, Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 39-19627 reports that 3-hydroxymethyl p-menthane 
(menthyl carbinol) has a flavor closely resembling that of 1-menthol 
and suggests its use as a flavorant in confectionary, chewing gum and 
tobacco. In Swiss Patent No. 484,032 certain saccharide esters of 
menthol are proposed as additive to tobacco. In French Pat. Spec. No. 
1,572,332 N,N-Dimethyl 2-ethylbutanamide is reported as having a minty 
odor and refreshing effect, and the minty odor of N,N-diethyl 
2,2-dimethylpropanamide is referred to. A similar effect is reported 
for N,N-diethyl 2-ethylbutanamide in Berichte 39, 1223, (1906). A 
minty odor has also been reported for 2,4,6-trimethylheptan-4-ol and 
2,4,6-trimethyl help-2-en-4-ol in Parfums-Cosmetiques-Savons, May 
1956, pp. 17-20. The cooling effect of menthol and other related 
terpene alcohols and their derivatives has also been studied and  
 
reported in Koryo, 95, (1970), pp. 39-43. 2,3-p-menthane diol has also 
been reported as having a sharp cooling taste (Beilstein, Handbuch der 
Organischen Chemie, 4th Ed. (1923) Vol . 6, p. 744). Carboxamides have also been disclosed for use in a variety of 
compositions. Two patents describing such materials and compositions 
are U.S. 4,136,163, January 23, 1979 to Watson et al. and U.S. 
4,230,688, October 28, 1980 to

ketal of the formula 


 
in which 


R

-C
6
-alkylene radical having at least 1, but 
not more than 3, hydroxyl group(s), and 

either R
2
 and R
3
 independently of one another represent C

which is optionally substituted by 1 to 3 radicals selected from the 

group comprising hydroxyl, amino and halogen (such as fluorine, 
chlorine, bromine or iodine), C

-aryl, preferably phenyl, with the proviso that the total of the 
C atoms of R
2
 and R
3
 is not less than 3, or R
2
 and R
3
 together 
represent an alkylene radical which, together with the carbon atom 

which carries the radicals R
2
 and R

by C

selected from 
N-substituted-p-menthane-3-carboxamides of the formula: 


 
where 
R', when taken separately, is hydrogen or an aliphatic 
radical containing up to 25 carbon atoms; R'' when taken 

separately is hydroxy, or an aliphatic radical containing up 
to 25 carbon atoms, with the proviso that when R' is 

hydrogen R'' may also be an aryl radical of up to 10 carbon 
atoms and selected from substituted  

 
phenyl, phenalkyl or substituted phenalkyl, naphthyl and
