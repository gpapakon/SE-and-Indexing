Method for recording times and intermediate times at sporting 
events, especially large and multi-discipline events with 

immediate determination of the result, whereby a larger number of 
recording stations are positioned along the competition track, which 

are connected to a central station which evaluates the incoming 
information, each recording station has a device to deliver energy 

and to receive signals and each sportsperson is handed a transmitter 
with personal code, which, upon reaching the respective recording 

station and the reception of the energy emitted by the recording 
station, passes the code to the recording station, which is received 

by the station and is immediately forwarded to the central station, 
where the evaluation is effected, 
wherein
 the transmitter functions 
passively and with high frequency,
 
that the sportsperson holds the high frequency transmitter in the 

recording station,
 
that the recording station charges the transmitter energetically via 

the device through high frequency before emitting the code,
 
that the device is a frame antenna, and
 
that the recording stations are connected to the central station in a 

wireless manner and forward the received code with an additional 
code of the recording station to the central station.  

 
Method according to claim 1, 
wherein
 said encoding is effected 
digitally. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein
 said evaluation 
is done by a computer in the central station. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein
 the results 
obtained from evaluation are shown on an indicator board. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein
 said passive 
high frequency transmitter is a transponder.
