<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a dry phase device for separating 
high density lipoprotein from a blood (serum or plasma) 

sample. The device comprises a fluid permeable material 
having dispersed therein finely divided, porous silica 

or silicate particles as selective absorbant for HDL. 
By combining t
he device with a second layer designed to 
remove VLDL/chylomicrons from the blood, and a third 

layer containing means for quantitative cholesterol 
detection, there is provided a test device for the 

direct determination of LDL cholesterol.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of clinical 
assay techniques and involves the measurement of low 
density lipoprotein cholesterol. Lipoproteins are complex particles comprising 
proteins and lipids which are found in the circulatory 
system. One of their functions is to carry water 
insoluble substances, such as cholesterol and cholesterol 
esters, for eventual cellular utilization. While 
all cells require cholesterol for growth, the excess 
accumulation of cholesterol by cells can lead to 
certain diseases including atherosclerosis. There are a variety of classes of lipoproteins in 
serum which can be classified by their density. These 
classes include very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), 
low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins 
(HDL). All of these lipopro-teins contain 
varying amounts of cholesterol. A total serum cholesterol 
determination is a complex sum of the amount that 
each lipoprotein contributes to the total lipoprotein 
population of the serum.  While it is known that the amount of total serum 
cholesterol can be correlated with the incidence of 
atherosclerosis, evidence from studies of recent years 
has shown that specific lipoprotein types are more 
closely associated with the progression of heart 
disease, including atherosclerosis, than others. More 
recent studies have implicated LDL as the class of 
lipoproteins responsible for the accumulation of 
cholesterol in the cells whereas HDL has been shown to 
be active in the removal of excess cholesterol from 
cells. Accordingly, various systems have been proposed 
for the measurement of cholesterol bearing lipoproteins 
in general and LDL in particular. Amorphous silica, i.e. that form of SiO₂ which 
lacks a crystal structure, has been used as an adsorbant 
since at least as early as World War I when it was 
considered for use as an absorbant in gas masks. 
Amorphous silica is broadly divided into three categories: 
vitreous silica or glass made by fusing quartz; 
silica M made by irradiating either amorphous or 
crystalline silica with high speed neutrons and micro-porous 
silica. The microparticulate silicas include 
pyrogenic silicas and silicas precipitated from aqueous 
solution. Pyrogenic silicas are formed at high temperature 
by condensation of SiO₂ from the vapor phase, or 
at lower temperature by chemical reaction in the vapor 
phase followed by condensation. Silica formed in aqueous solution can occur as 
sols, gels or particles. A gel has a three-dimensional, 
continuous structure, whereas a sol
