<ABSTRACT>
A dispensing device for the treatment and washing of textile items, which can be used with liquid detergents or similar compositions, both for pretreatment of the items and to dispense the said detergent in the washing machine during washing. In particular the dispensing device consists of a hollow body (11) with smooth walls, a base (13) on which a vertical position can be maintained, at least one filling and dispensing aperture (14) through which the device can be filled with a quantity of detergent and through which the detergent is distributed into the washing machine drum during washing, with a pouring aperture (24) formed in the hollow body (11) above the maximum filling level, the pouring aperture (24) being roughly horizontal when the dispenser is in vertical position on the base (13), and through which a specific quantity of detergent can be poured by tilting the device (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a dispensing device for 
treatment and washing of textile items with liquid 
detergents. In recent times the use of dispensing devices for the 
dispersion of detergents in washing machines has become 
wide spread both for machines not equipped with an 
automatic dispensing device and in order to improve 
detergent dispensing in machines that have automatic 
detergent dispensing means, generally consisting of one or 
more drawers. Known forms of such dispensing device are disclosed in 
EP-A-0368680 which are generally spherical in shape with 
one or more apertures allowing the device to be filled and 
subsequently, during washing, enabling the detergent to 
escape as a result of the drum rotation movement in the 
washing machine and the pressure exerted by the items 
contained in the said machine. FR-A-2629433 discloses a disposable detergent 
dispenser particularly for liquid detergents which has a 
pouring spout by means of which detergent can be poured 
from the device. WO-A-92/09736, which is included in the state of the 
art by virtue of Art 54(3) EPC, discloses a detergent 
dispensing device having a transverse opening through which  
 
detergent can be dispensed for pre-treatment of a textile 
article. It is also well known that certain textile items 
require prior treatment when they exhibit significant 
stains or particularly dirty spots that are unlikely to be 
removed with a normal washing operation. Such prior 
treatment is often carried out by hand with consequent 
contact with the detergent, so that it would be 
particularly advantageous to be able to do it by means of 
an appropriate device. For this purpose it has been proposed to provide a 
dispensing device which, in addition to the central opening 
for filling and subsequent dispensing of the detergent, has 
a further lateral aperture made in an outwardly projecting 
part of the device. This device does not however allow 
accurate pouring of the detergent or convenient prior 
treatment of the items to be washed, since it only allows 
detergent to be poured at areas such as stains. The 
problem of accurate pouring and of distributing and 
spreading the detergent precisely and accurately is not 
resolved. The detergent still requires spreading and 
rubbing onto the fabric by hand in order to perform an 
effective pretreatment action. The purpose of the present invention is to produce a 
dispensing device that can be used with liquid detergents 
or similar compositions both to pretreat items fully and 
effect

<CLAIMS>
Dispensing device that can be placed in the drum of 
a washing machine to dispense a detergent during the 

machine washing cycle, the said device comprising a 
hollow body (11) with smooth walls, a base (13) on which 

the dispensing device may be maintained in a vertical 
position, at least one filling and dispensing aperture 

(14) through which the device can be filled with a 
quantity of detergent and through which the detergent is 

dispensed in the washing machine drum during washing, and 
a pouring opening (24) above the maximum filling level 

through which a quantity of detergent can be poured by 
tilting the device (10), the pouring opening (24) lying 

in a plane generally parallel to the plane of the base 
(13) and being formed by the upper edges of a pouring and 

spreading spout (21) extending laterally from the hollow 
body (11) characterised by the pouring and spreading 

spout having a spreading surface (23) suitable for 
spreading detergent applied to a textile article, and the 

pouring and spreading spout (21) communicating with the 
interior of the hollow body. 
Dispensing device according to claim 1 in which the 
pouring and spreading spout communicates with the hollow 

body (11) through a connecting aperture (18) having an 
area less than the area of the pouring opening (24). 
Dispensing device according to claim 2 characterised 
in that the communicating aperture (18) has the shape of 

a trapezium having a short top edge (20) and a longer 
bottom edge (20') parallel to the plane of the base (13). 
Dispensing device according to claim 2 characterised 
in that the communicating aperture (18) is a rectangular 

aperture.  
 
Dispensing device according to claim 3 or 4 
characterised in that the corners of the communicating 

aperture (18) are rounded. 
Dispensing device according to any one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that the pouring and 

spreading spout (21) comprises a flat front wall (23) 
which constitutes the spreading surface, and two side 

walls (22) connecting the front wall (23) to the outside 
surface (12) of the hollow body (11). 
Dispensing device according to claim 6 characterised 
in that the flat front wall (23) of the spout (21) 

extends in a plane tangential to the outer surface (12) 
of the hollow body and at right angles to the plane of 

the base (13). 
Dispensing device according to claim 7 characterised 
in that the upper edge of the front wall (23) lies at a 

lower level than an annular edge (15) of the filling and 
dispensing aperture (14). 
Dispensing device according to claim 6 characterised 
in that the outer surface of the front wall (23) of the 

spout (21) has a non-smooth wrinkled surface.
