<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods of controlling synchronous
electrical systems, and to electrical systems using such methods.Many electrical systems, particularly those incorporating processor means
or other logic circuits, utilise clock signals. For example, it is conventional to
control a synchronous electrical system having a number of logic circuits by
applying a clock signal comprising a train of clock pulses to the logic circuits
such that they are driven in synchronism with the clock pulses. However, clock
signals contain high frequency harmonics and these cause interference effects.
In audio systems, the harmonics may be within the audio band, and this is
directly audible. In other environments intermodulation can generate unwanted
spikes and tones. These interference effects can make it difficult, for example,
to design digital circuits which meet EC regulations controlling electromagnetic
radiation.In some cases it is possible to avoid the worst interference effects by
shielding such that there is no coupling between circuits, but this is an expensive
solution which is never totally successful. Furthermore, a single spike in a
frequency spectrum is difficult to cope with even if the spike has a relatively low
level as compared to background noise.EP-A-0163313 reduces the need for such shielding by modulating the
master clock in a manner which causes the clock signal to have a broader
spectral signature, eg by randomly determining the timing of the trailing edge of each clock pulse, thereby varying the mark/space ratio. The modulation, which has to be controlled and statistically
predictable, may still have to be used in conjunction with shielding techniques.Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 16., No. 263 (E-1216) and the corresponding JP-A-458756 disclose the
pseudo-random modulation of a clock signal to produce a non-periodic driving signal to reduce
resonance, and thus audible noise.According to the present invention, a method of controlling a synchronous
electrical system as defined above as conventional is characterised in that 
the method comprises the steps of dividing a regular clock signal having
regularly occurring clock pulses to generate a randomised clock signal having a
train of clock pulses with a random mark-space ratio, and applying the
randomised clock signal to the logic circuits to drive the logic circuits in
synchronism with clock pulses of the randomised clock signal, wherein each
logic circuit is driven by selected edges of the randomised clock signal arriving at
