<ABSTRACT>
An osteometry in which the accuracy 
of measuring a bone by using an image, 

which is obtained by radiography, of a 
bone to be examined, mainly a sponge bone, 

is improved, which method consists of the 
steps of designating two points each on head 

and trunk portions of a bone to be examined 
in an interested region of an image thereof 

obtained by radiography, and connecting the 
midpoints of the respective two points so as 

to determine the axis of the bone; setting a 
reference measuring line, which is perpendicular 

to the bone axis, in a position which 
is away along the bone axis by a predetermined 

distance from either the two points on 
the head portion of the bone or the midpoint 

thereof; obtaining a pattern, which is relative 
to the penetrated radiation dose of the object 

bone, along the reference measuring line or 
a single or a plurality of measuring lines in 

the vicinity of the reference measuring line; 
and carrying out predetermined computation 

by using this pattern. An apparatus for use in 
practising this method is also provided. This 

method may be modified so that the computation 

of a pattern is carried out in a preset 
partial region alone on the basis of the width 

of a bone to be examined. A plurality of patterns 
obtained of an object bone may be smoothed, and predetermined computation of the smoothed patterns may then 

be carried out. This method may have the steps of determining two points on borders at both end portions of an object 
bone with soft tissues on a pattern obtained, obtaining a corrected pattern concerning the penetrated radiation dose 

of the object bone by subtracting from the first-mentioned pattern a region concerning the penetrated radiation dose 
corresponding to soft tissues approximated by a line connecting these two points, and conducting the measurement of 

the object bone by carrying out computation using this correction pattern.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bone
morphometric method and a bone morphometric
apparatus. More specifically, the present
invention provides a bone morphometric method
capable of measuring the pattern of the quantity of
radiation transmitted through a sample bone, among
bones suitable for measurement including a radius
and a metacarpus, obtained from an image based on
an image formed by irradiating the sample bone with
radiation and measuring the transmitted radiation
and of performing rational and accurate assay of
the sample bone in terms of bone assaying
parameters, particularly, by cancellate bone
assaying parameters, and a bone morphometric
apparatus for carrying out the same bone
morphometric method.The morphologies of human bones are measured to
assay the growth and aging of bones, to diagnose
and determine the degree of progress of bone
diseases such as osteoporosis and osteomalacia, or
to confirm a therapeutic effect.Human bones are classified into cortical bones
and cancellate bones. Cortical bones have dense
bone structures having the shapes of pipes.
Representative cortical bones are the shafts of the
long tubular bones of the extremities.Cancellate bones have mesh structures of
osteocytes and are the epiphyses of long tubular
bones, vertebrae, carpal bones, heel bones, 
anklebones, tarsi and such. Osteocytes of
cancellate bones, as compared with those in
cortical bones, have large areas in contact with
soft tissues including blood vessels. Therefore,
the progress of metabolism of cancellate bones is
rapid and hence the progress of bone diseases in
cancellate bones or changes in the state of
cancellate bones caused by therapy are rapid.MD, photon absorptiometry and radioscopy are used
in generally known bone morphometric methods. MD
measures density distribution in a roentgenogram of
a sample bone, produced on an x-ray film by
irradiating a sample bone with X-rays, by a
microdensitometer (Kotsu Taisha, Vol. 13, 00.
187-195 (1980) and Kotsu Taisha, Vol. 14, pp.
91-104 (1981)), photon absorptiometry irradiates a
sample bone with gamma rays and measures the
quantity of transmitted gamma rays with a detector,
and radioscopy irradiates a sample bone with X-rays
and measures the quantity of transmitted X-rays
with a detector.MD is easily applicable to bone measurement and
has progressively become prevalent because MD uses
x-ray photographs that can be readily produced by
the widespread x-ray photographic apparatuses which
are widely used for diagnosing bone fractures.These known bone
