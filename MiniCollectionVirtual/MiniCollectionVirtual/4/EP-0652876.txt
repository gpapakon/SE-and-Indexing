<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE HERBICIDAL TRIAZINONES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 5 This invention relates to certain substituted fused heterocyclic compounds which are useful as herbicides and their agriculturally suitable compositions as well as methods for their use as general or selective preemergent or postemergent herbicides or as plant 0 growth regulants.New compounds effective for controlling the growth of undesired vegetation are in constant demand. In the most common situation, such compounds are sought to selectively control the growth of weeds in useful crops 5 such as cotton, rice, corn, wheat, citrus and soybeans, to name a few. Unchecked weed growth in such crops (including plantation crops) can cause significant losses, reducing profit to the farmer and increasing costs to the consumer. In other situations, herbicides 0 are desired which will control all plant growth. Examples of areas in which complete control of all vegetation is desired are areas around railroad tracks, storage tanks and industrial storage areas. There are many products commercially available for these 5 purposes, but the search continues for products which are more effective, less costly and environmentally safe.DE 3,340,026 discloses herbicides of the formula
whereinR-i is H, C -Cg alkyl (optionally substituted by halogen, CN, OH and/or ^-04 alkoxy) , C3-C8 cycloalkyl (optionally substituted by alkyl, halogen and/or phenyl) , an aromatic or aromatic-aliphatic residue (optionally substituted by C-L-C4 alkyl, halogen, C!-C4 alkoxy, N02 and/or CF3) , or a heterocyclic hydrocarbon residue; and R2, 3 and R are H, ^-Cg alkyl (optionally substituted by halogen) or aryl (optionally substituted by ^-Cg alkyl, halogen, C3.-C4 alkoxy, N02 and/or CF3) .SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention comprises novel compounds of Formula I, agriculturally suitable compositions containing them, and their method-of-use as preemergent and/or postemergent herbicides and/or plant growth regulants. The compounds of Formula I are:whereinQ is selected from the group:Q-l Q-2 Q-3A is selected from the group ^^4 alkyl, C1-C haloalkyl, C2-C alkenyl, C2-C4 alkynyl, OR16,SR16 and halogen; B is selected from the group ^^4 alkyl, C2-C4 haloalkyl, C3-C4 alkenyl and C3-C4 alkynyl; A and B can be taken together as X-Y-Z to form a fused ring such that X is connected to nitrogen and Z is connected to carbon; X is selected from the group CHR17, CH CH2 andCR17=CR18; Y is selected from the group CHR19, CR19=CR20,CHR19CHR20, NR21, 0 and S(0)n; Z is selected from the group CHR22,
