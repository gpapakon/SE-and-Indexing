<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermosetting
urethane elastomer, more particularly to a
thermosetting urethane, elastomer prepared from a
prepolymer containing terminal isocyanate groups
obtained from p-phenylene diisocyanate
(hereinafter abbreviated to PPDI) and a polyol, and a
curing agent comprising specific polyols.Thermosetting urethane elastomers are
generally produced (a) by curing
a prepolymer containing terminal isocyanate groups
and derived from a diisocyanate such as
tolylene diisocyanate, diphenylmethane diisocyanate
(hereinafter abbreviated to MDI) or hexamethylene
diisocyanate, and a polyol such as polyether
polyol, polyester polyol or polycaprolactone polyol,
using a glycol such as
1,4-butylene glycol (hereinafter abbreviated to 1,4-BG)
or an amine such as 3,3'-dichloro-4,4'-diaminodiphenyl-methane,
or (b) by rapidly curing an
unstable prepolymer derived from 1,5-naphthalene 
diisocyanate (hereinafter abbreviated to NDI) and a
polyester polyol, with a glycol such
as 1,4-BG.These thermosetting urethane elastomers are
highly elastic, having excellent tensile strength,
and have been widely used for rolls, solid
tires and belts. However, the elastomer obtained in
method (a) is inferior in heat resistance,
has a hardness greatly dependent on
temperature, and is therefore unsuitable for use in
environments subjected to elevated temperatures or to large
changes of temperature.
In contrast, the prepolymer obtained in method (b)
has excellent heat resistance, but since it is obtained from an unstable
prepolymer drawbacks are involved in the
equipment used for its production and in the time restrictions involved. Among patent publications in this area, FR-A-2175119
for example describes coating compositions
based on isocyanate-terminated urethane prepolymers
and addition products of substituted isocyanurates and
substituted lactones. Also, FR-A-1339799 describes a
procedure for forming polyurethane coatings for
electrical conductors in which an aromatic
polyisocyanate such as MDI is reacted with an alkyl
aromatic diol such as hydroquinone bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)
ether and a triol such as
trimethylolpropane.The present invention which seeks to improve the
heat resistance and temperature variation in physical
properties of thermosetting urethane elastomers is
derived from intensive investigations on combinations
of various prepolymers containing terminal isocyanate
groups and derived from diisocyanate and polyol, with
various curing agents, and is based on the discovery
that such properties can be improved
