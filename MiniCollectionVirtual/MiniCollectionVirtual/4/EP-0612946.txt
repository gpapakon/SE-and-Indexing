<ABSTRACT>
A cable transit (1) has a plurality of modular blocks (6,7) being either 
cable blocks (6) surrounding a cable (4) or blanking blocks (7) for closing a 

modular space arranged in rows in a frame (2), and a compression and packer 
assembly including a pressure plate (15) and packer blocks (16) for applying 

pressure to the assembled array of blocks (6,7) and cables (4) within the 
frame (2). The pressure plate (15) has a metal body (18) seated on the top row 

of blocks (6,7) with an edge strip (22) of low thermal conductivity plastics on 
each side edge for insulating the body (18) to reduce heat transfer across the 

transit (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns improvements in or relating to transits that 
are used where elongate articles such as cables or pipes are required to 
penetrate a partition such as a bulkhead or deck. A conventional transit has a frame defining a rectangular opening for 
the cables or pipes with each cable or pipe being surrounded by a resilient 
block. The blocks are arranged in rows with any gaps being filled by solid 
blocks and the opening is closed by an end packer assembly that maintains 
the array of blocks under pressure to clamp and seal the blocks to each 
other and to the frame and to the cables or pipes. The frame and parts of the end packer assembly are commonly made 
of metal having a high thermal conductivity. As a result, to comply with 
safety standards for heat transfer across the transit, it has been necessary 
when installing such transits to provide additional insulation on one or both 
sides of the transit. This is inconvenient and adds to the installation costs. The present invention has been made from a consideration of this 
problem. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a transit 
for cables or the like comprises a rigid frame defining a rectangular opening, 
a plurality of blocks for assembly in rows within the opening between 
opposed side walls of the frame, the blocks being adapted to surround a 
cable or blank of a modular space, a pressure plate comprising a metal body 
for seating on the top row of blocks between the side walls of the frame with 
opposite side edges on entry and exit sides of the opening, and a plurality of 
packer blocks for insertion into a clearance space between the plate and an 
end wall of the frame to apply pressure to the assembled array of modular 
blocks and cables for sealing the blocks to each other and the frame and the 
cables characterised in that the plate has low thermal conductivity material 
on at least one side edge of the body. The main advantage of the invention is that the metal body of the 
pressure plate is insulated from the environment by the low thermal 
conductivity material on at least one side of the transit so as to reduce heat 
transfer by the metal body across the transit. This reduction in heat transfer 
is achieved without any significant affect on the pressure applied through 
the metal body of the pressure plate to the assembled array of modular 
blocks and cables by the packer blocks for sealing the assembled array of  
 
modular blocks and cables. Furthermore, the metal body is resistant to 
degradatio
