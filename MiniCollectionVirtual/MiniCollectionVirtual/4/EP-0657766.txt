<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a camera comprising 
exposure means (23,24) for exposing an image-taking plane 

to an image of the object field formed by an image-taking 
lens,

 
focus detecting means (12) for detecting the focus state in 

a predetermined zone, and
 

exposure operating means (19) for executing an exposure 
operation, and

 
exposure calculating means based on the focus state detected 

by said focus detection means for discriminating, after an 
in-focus state and immediately before the exposure 

operation, whether to effect the exposure operation in the 
state of the image of the object field at the in-focus state 

or in the state of the image after the in-focus state and 
immediately before the exposure operation. This camera is 

capable of final exposure calculation by identifying the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
camera, capable of automatic 
exposure control by identifying a change in composition 
in image field and the kind of main object. In conventional camera with automatic focusing 
function, there is already known a single (one-shot) 
auto focusing mode in which the focused state is maintained 
once the lens is focused to an object in a distance 
measuring zone, or a focus lock mode by a sliding motion 
of the camera after it is focused. The exposure in the 
photographing operation in such single auto focusing mode 
or focus lock mode has been based on the brightness of 
the central area of the image field at the focusing 
operation. However such conventional camera are often unable 
to provide appropriate exposure, since the exposure is 
calculated always in the same manner regardless whether 
the composition in image field is changed or not and 
regardless of the nature of the object, whether it is a 
person, a landscape or a close-up.  In accordance with the pre-characterizing part of claim 1, 
US-A-4 774 401 discloses a camera in which light is 
measured and an exposure is calculated after the photographing 
lens is in-focus. If it has been decided that 
the photographing lens has not been in-focus, the lens is 
moved so as to bring it in-focus again, and thereafter the 
light measurement and exposure calculation is performed 
again. This operation of the prior art camera is performed 
in response to the first stroke of the release button, 
However, the second stroke of the release button (which 
actually starts the exposure of the film) is not considered 
relevant according to said prior art document. Therefore, 
there arises the problem that after a main object is set 
in a light metering area at a center of an image field to 
bring the lens to the in-focus state, it is impossible to 
photograph in a state that the main object is set out of 
the center of the image field. In consideration of the foregoing, the object of the present 
invention is to provide a camera, capable of finer exposure 
calculation by identifying the change in composition in image 
field and the kind of main object. This object is achieved in accordance with the 
features of claim 1, respectively claim 6.  A further object of the present invention is to 
provide a camera, 
capable of providing an appropriate exposure without 
erroneous identification of a change in composition even 
in case of an out-of-focus state caused by vibration of 
camera or main object at the photographing operation.
