Data recording device, comprising:

an interface (IT) for receiving data (D) to be recorded,
recording means (LEC) for recording data from an interface (IT) on a recording support
(DIS) using magnetic and/or optical and/or magneto-optical technology and comprising a

control unit (UT) for monitoring the recording of the data on the recording support
(DIS),

characterised in that it further comprises

a temporary safeguard support (MEM) of electronic technology, the data (D) from the
interface (IT) being recorded temporarily on the temporary safeguard support (MEM)

successively as they are received,
means (AC, TH) for obtaining at least one variable selected relative to a condition of the
environment or of a predetermined operation of the recording device or of at least one of

its constituent means, and for delivering a datum representing the variable obtained (AO,
TO), and
in that the control unit (UT) comprises a mode of recording in which the variable
obtained (AO, TO) is compared to at least one predetermined value (A2, T2), and
in the presence of a variable obtained which is higher than the predetermined value, no
access to the recording support (DIS) is authorised, whereas in the presence of a variable

obtained which is lower than or equal to the predetermined value, the data stored
temporarily on the temporary safeguard support (MEM) are recorded on the recording

support (DIS) provided that access to the recording support is authorised.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the variable relates to the acceleration
undergone by the recording device or by at least one of its constituent means and in that

the obtaining means (AC) form an accelerometer disposed according to a geometric
relation predetermined with respect to the substantial axes of the recording device, in

particular of the recording means (LEC). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the variable relates to the ambient
temperature of the recording device or at least one of its constituent means, in particular

recording means (LEC), and in that the obtaining means form a thermometer (TH)
disposed according to a geometric relation predetermined with respect to the recording

device or one of its constituent means, in particular to the recording means (LEC).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the datum representing the variable
obtained (AO, TO) is derived from data received at the interface.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the variable relates to the power
supply of the device, in that the obtaining means form means for detecting the

interruption of current, and in that supply means (BAT) are further provided for
supplying power to the temporary safeguard support (MEM).
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that it is intended to be
on board an airship.
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the recording
means (LEC) are housed in a box.
Device according to claim 7, characterised in that it further comprises:

a first clamp (ETI) in a U shape, of which the base is intended to receive the lower face
of the box, and of which the lateral walls are fixed in a detachable manner to the lateral

walls of the box;
a second clamp (ETS) in a U shape turned in the opposite direction and which is adapted
to cover the upper face of the box; and
resilient fixing means (FEL1 to FEL4) disposed between the lateral walls of the first
clamp (ETI) and those of the second clamp (ETS) for fixing in a resilient manner the first

clamp to the second clamp.
Device according to claim 8, characterised in that the resilient fixing means (FEL1 to
FEL4) comprise a plurality of fixing elements, each comprising:


a screw (10) having a head (14) and a shank (12), the shank comprising a threaded end
intended to be countersunk into a lateral wall of the first clamp (ETI),
a first washer (14) threaded on to the shank (12) up to a shoulder (18) housed on the
shank (12) at a predetermined height,
a member (20) forming a plug threaded on the shank (12) between the first washer (165)
and the lateral wall of the first clamp,
a body (22) in the shape of a pot, whose edges are fixed to a lateral wall of the second
clamp (ETS), the head of the screw as well as a portion of the shank being housed in the

body (22) in a floating manner between the first and second fixed points spaced apart
from one another by a predetermined distance, the shank crossing an aperture (30)

formed in the bottom of the pot,
a second washer (32) threaded on to the part of the shank between the first and second
fixed points (26 and 28), and
at least one of the first and second membranes (34 and 36) each formed of a material
having a property of resilient return suitable for damping the vibrations capable of being

undergone by the recording means up to a predetermined level, the first and second
membranes (34 and 36) being housed in the body on either side of the second washer

(32) and bearing respectively on the faces of the second washer so as to dampen the
mechanical vibrations of the shank between the first and second fixed points.
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that it comprises
furthermore protection means comprising storage means for storing temporarily a supply

voltage and capable of transmitting the supply voltage in the presence of power cuts of a
predetermined duration.
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the table of
description of files (FAT) of the data to be recorded as well a
s the root table (ROOT) are
safeguarded in the temporary safeguard support (MEM) before every recording of data

on the recording support (DIS). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the control unit is
adapted to monitor the writing of data on the recording support (DIS) emanating from

the temporary safeguard support (MEM) at the end of the file containing the whole of
the data previously written in the file.
Device according to claim 12, characterised in that the control unit is adapted to close
the file completed immediately after writing of the block of data in the recording support

(DIS), with updating of file allocation tables (FAT) and root (ROOT).
