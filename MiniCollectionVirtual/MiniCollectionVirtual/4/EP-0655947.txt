<ABSTRACT>
A method of destabilizing the homogeneous steady state of a dynamical system with two or more dynamically coupled variables through the action of a differential bulk flow of the key species, termed Differential Flow Induced Instability (DIFII), is disclosed. The DIFII is also applicable to systems with time periodic (limit cycle) and aperiodic (chaotic) states. Turing predicted that in systems characterized by activator/inhibitor kinetics a homogeneous, stable steady state of the reactive system may lose its stability and form inhomogeneous patterns due to the interaction of diffusion and reaction when the diffusion coefficient of the inhibitor is sufficiently greater than that of the activator. This mechanism is believed to form the basis of biological morphogenesis. The method of the present invention avoids this constraint on the diffusivities in the dynamically coupled two component system by using a differential bulk flow between the activator and the inhibitor species rather than a differential diffusivity. In systems with three (or more) dynamically coupled components the requirement of the presence of an activator species (or subsystem) is relaxed and if there is no activator species (or subsystem) present, the system may be destabilized by a differential flow of its components, in contrast to systems of two dynamical variables. Technological advantages such as reaction yield enhancement are shown. The method disclosed herein is shown to be applicable to a wide range of systems including chemical, biological and physical.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DYNAMICAL DESTABILIZATION OF SYSTEMS CHARACTERIZED BY KINETICALLY COUPLED COMPONENTS USING A DIFFERENTIAL FLOWFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method of destabilizing the homogeneous steady state, or periodic or aperiodic states of spatially extended dynamical systems characterized by kinetically or dynamically coupled components through the action of a differential bulk flow of the key components. â€¢BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTuring predicted that a homogeneous and otherwise stable steady state of a reactive, kinetic system comprising an activator and inhibitor species may lose its stability and form inhorrn^eneous patterns due to the interaction of diffusion and reaci.on1. This prediction has been recently verified experimentally by Castets et al. wherein pattern formation was observed in the chlorite/iodide/malonic acid system2. These results support Turing's prediction that a homogeneous and otherwise stable reactive system may lose its stability (Turing instability) and form inhomogeneous patterns due to the interaction of diffusion and reaction.This mechanism is believed to be fundamental to morphogenesis in biological systems3. Specifically, the Turing instability can occur in an autocatalytlc chemical or biochemical system comprising an activator species A which stimulates its own production and the production of its antagonist, an inhibitor I, if the diffusion coefficient of the inhibitor I is sufficiently greater than that of the activator A3. When such a system is maintained in a homogeneous condition 

such as by stirring or other agitation means, it settles into a steady state through the balance of activation and inhibition. However, when a local concentration fluctuation arises in a non- agitated system, diffusion comes into play in addition to chemical relaxation. Diffusion acts to remove or replenish species that are locally in excess or depleted, respectively, as the case may be. When this process proceeds at different rates for the two species, proportional to their diffusivities, the balance between the activator and inhibitor, that existed in the perfectly stirred system, may be broken in such a way as to permit the activator concentration to grow locally3. Therefore, the primary role of diffusion in the instability is to spatially disengage the counteracting species.The physical constraints under which the Turing instability is achieved are quite severe and can occur in an activator/inhibitor system only if the diffusion coefficient of the inhibitor is
