<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a printed circuit board arrangement having conductive connecting regions (2) for conductive pads (3, 8) and solder-resist regions (4) which are higher than the connecting regions and the pads and have cut-outs (5) in the region of the connecting surfaces, it is provided that the area of a cut-out in the solder resist is selected as a function of the area of a pad and of a given solder cone height and that, in the cut-out, the connecting surface (3, 8) is broader than the associated, connected connecting region (2, 9). The process for producing a printed circuit board provides for solder material to be deposited into the cut-out in the solder resist produced according to the process, which solder material at least partially covers the connecting surface and its non-conductive surround in the cut-out. The connection, which is assigned to the connecting surface, of a component is soldered to the connecting surface by melting the solder material.
