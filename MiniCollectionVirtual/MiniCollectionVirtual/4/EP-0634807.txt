<ABSTRACT>
The antenna device has an antenna wire loop which is intrinsically rotated twice, through 180 DEG  in each case, to form two electrically outer partial loops (1, 3) and one electrically central partial loop (2). One of the two electrically outer partial loops (3) is arranged geometrically between the electrically central partial loop (2) and the other electrically outer partial loop (1). An impedance element (11) is connected between two connection points (9, 10) which are arranged at the input and output of the geometrically central partial loop. The antenna device according to the invention has a highly matched characteristic and, if its parameters at the resonant frequency of the labels to be detected are suitably selected, acts like an antenna having only approximately two to two and a half partial loops.
