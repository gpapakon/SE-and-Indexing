<ABSTRACT>
An electric quadrant switch (10) is provided with a plastics
material housing (11) in which stationary and movable contact

elements (46, 47) are received, with an actuating member (18)
which, for actuation of the movable contact elements (46, 47),

is held in the plastics material housing (11) in such a way that
it can be pivoted from a neutral position in preferably four

actuation directions, the actuating member (18) having an
actuator axis (21) and radially projecting actuating arms (20),

and with components (24, 25, 41) causing the readjustment and
sustained adoption of the neutral position by the actuating

member (18). In order to achieve a good haptic sensation and a
detectable switching sensation in a small installation space and

with relatively low expenditure and to achieve low transmission
resistances, it is provided that a switching transmission mat

(51) which overlaps the movable contact element (47) at least
between the contact elements (46, 47) and the actuating arm (20)

of the actuating member (18) for switching movement transmission
and in that the actuating arm (20) is provided at its free end

with an axially projecting spring-loaded latching element (25)
which, during actuation, is guided along a connecting link (41)

which, in the neutral position of the actuating member (18), has
a latching face (44),

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric switch, in
particular quadrant switch, according to the preamble of claim
1.Electric switches of this type, such as quadrant switches, are,
for example, used in the actuation of rear view mirrors, seat
parts etc. in motor vehicles in order to move these components
into the desired position.In an electric switch of the type mentioned at the outset known
from DE 198 44 336 C1, a silicone switching mat in the form of a
so-called dome switching mat is used which contains movable
contact elements which cooperate directly with the actuating
arms of the actuating member. By pivoting the actuating member
the relevant movable contact element of the dome switching mat
is brought into contact with the corresponding stationary
contact element by overcoming the elasticity of the attachment
of the movable contact element on the plane region of the dome
switching mat.While silicone switching mats of this type are inexpensive to
produce and are silent in operation they do however have high
transition resistances. The "spongy" switching sensation is also
disadvantageous in this case, i.e. the haptic sensation upon
switching is unsatisfactory, as it cannot be sufficiently
determined by the operator whether and when the switching
instant has been/is achieved and the switching is complete.
Correspondingly higher actuating forces for a good haptic 
sensation is only possible with considerable expenditure which,
moreover, is not possible with the desired small installation
space when using dome switching mats.DE 198 53 438 A1 discloses a multi directional electric switch
arrangement also of the type mentioned in the preamble and
having a silicon switching mat in the form a so called dome
switching mat containing moveable contact elements which
cooperate directly with actuating legs of the actuating
member. The actuating legs being with respect to the housing
axially provided, the axially operative spring load of which
performing a reset of the actuating member from a pivoted
position to an upright neutral position.The same applies with respect to a reset of the actuating
member with an electrical switch assembly being disclosed in
EP 0 348 202 A3.US 3 828 148 discloses a multi-position electrical switch
assembly having an actuating member the inner free end of
which is being pivoted and acts on moveable contact elements
being spring loaded. A reset of this actuating member from its
pivoted positions to the upright neutral position is performed
by the spring loads of the springs of
