<ABSTRACT>
In a method for preparing an extract from an extractable 
starting material, such as in the preparation of coffee, for 

example, whereby side walls (4) are erected around a filter (11) so as 
to form a preparation chamber (10) into which the starting material 

is deposited, a dose of water is administered to the starting 
material, after which the remainder of the water is passed 

through the resulting substance under the influence of air 
pressure. 
The device (1) is comprised of at least a piston (2), a filter 
(11), and 

a cylinder (4) which surrounds the piston and is provided with a 
sealing portion (8) having a spray duct (9) which emerges into the 

preparation chamber (10). The cylinder (4) and/or sealing portion 
(8) are 

preferably arranged so as to be slideable, so as to yield a 
compact device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing 
an extract from an extractable material under exertion of air 
pressure, whereby vertical side walls are erected around a 
filter so as to form a preparation chamber in which the 
extractable material is deposited, subsequent to which a 
first dose of liquid is added from a spray duct to the 
extractable material, which liquid is in particular water, 
after which a second dose of liquid is added from the spray 
duct to the extractable material and is caused to pass 
through the extractable material and the filter under 
exertion of air pressure so as to form the extract, whereby 
the spray duct is located at the upper side of the 
preparation chamber and the filter is located at the lower 
side of the preparation chamber. The invention also relates to a device for performance 
of the said method. Such a method and device for preparing an extract, 
particularly a method or device for the preparation of, for 
example, coffee, tea, etc, are generally known. In the known method for preparation of coffee, tea or 
some other extract with the aid of the known device, water is 
forced under the influence of pressure through the 
extractable starting material, which comprises ground coffee 
or tea leaves, for example. The extract, which is generally 
captured in a beaker, subsequently constitutes the desired 
preparation. It is generally desirable that a qualitatively 
acceptable cup of coffee be preparable within an acceptable 
span of time (particularly from the point of view of a 
waiting customer) and making use of a minimum quantity of 
ground coffee, so as to be able to provide a finished product 
at minimal cost price.  
 The known method and device for preparing an extract 
from an extractable starting material do not satisfy this 
requirement to an acceptable extent. From the Dutch patent application NL-A-8104990 a method 
and device are known for preparing an extract from an 
extractable starting material, having several parts which can 
be moved relative to each other. From the American patent US-A-3,426,670 also a method 
and device are known for preparing an extract from an 
extractable material having also several parts which, during 
operation of the device, are moved relatively to each other. It is an objective of the invention to provide a method 
and a compact and easily disassembled device by means of 
which an extract can be obtained from an extractable starting 
material, without detrimental effect on the quality of the 
prepared

Method for preparing an extract from an extractable 
material under exertion of air pressure, whereby vertical side walls (4) are erected around a 

filter (11) so as to form a preparation chamber (10) in which the 
extractable material is deposited, subsequent to 

which a first dose of liquid is added from a spray duct (9) to the 
extractable material, which liquid is in particular aqueous, after 

which a second dose of liquid is added from the spray duct (9) to the 
extractable material and is caused to pass through 

the extractable material and the filter (11) under exertion of air pressure so as 
to form the extract, whereby the spray duct (9) 

is located at the upper side of the preparation chamber (10) and 
the filter (11) is located at the lower side of the preparation 

chamber (10) characterized in that the spray duct (9) and the filter (11) are both only 
movable in horizontal direction, respectively, and the vertical side walls (4) are only 

movable in vertical direction.  
 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the preparation chamber (10) is formed by moving the side walls in 

the form of a cylinder (4) upwards to the spray duct (9). 
Method according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the cylinder (4) is movable around a piston (2) having at its upper 

side the filter (11). 
Method according to any of the claims 1-3, whereby air which has 
permeated the filter (11) is admitted to the preparation chamber (10) 

intermediate to the times at which the aqueous liquid is 
administered. 
Method according to any of the claims 1-4, whereby the air in the 
preparation chamber (10) is expelled subsequent to preparation of 

the extract. 
Method according to any of the claims 2-5, whereby 
the cylinder (4) is lowered once preparation has been completed, 

and the filter (11) is rid of the remaining substance.
