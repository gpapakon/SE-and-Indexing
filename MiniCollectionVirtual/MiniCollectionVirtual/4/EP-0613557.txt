<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ultrasonic holographic imaging apparatus for 
viewing imaged holographic information of the internal structure of an object at 
different magnifications. Although commercial application of ultrasonic holography as been accurately 
pursued by many persons in the scientific and industrial communities for many 
years, only limited results have been obtained even though it was once thought 
that ultrasonic holography held great promise. It was felt that the application 
of ultrasonic holography was particularly applicable to the fields of nondestructive 
testing of materials and medical diagnostics of soft tissues that are relatively 
transparent to ultrasonic radiation. One of the principal problems that has been 
encountered and not effectively resolved is the difficulty of obtaining quality and 
consistent images. A further problem has been the inability to vary the 
magnification of the image while maintaining a consistent high quality image. As background, Fig. 1 shows a typical "real time" prior art ultrasonic 
holographic imaging system generally designated with the numeral 10. The 
system 10 is intended to ultrasonically inspect the interior of an object 12 such 
as the soft tissue of a human limb. The ultrasonic holographic imaging 
system 10 generally has a hologram generating subsystem 14 for generating an 
ultrasonic hologram. The system 10 also includes a hologram viewing subsystem 
(optical-subsystem) 16 for optically viewing the interior of the object 12 from a 
first order diffraction from the formed ultrasonic hologram. The subsystem 14 includes an object ultrasonic transducer 18 for 
generating plane waves through a liquid or gel coupling medium 20 contained 
in a deformable membrane 22. The deformable membrane 22 intimately contacts 
the object 12 on one side and a deformable membrane 24 contacts the object 
on the other side to provide ultrasonic coupling with minimum energy loss or 
wave distortion. The deformable membrane 24 forms part of the side wall of 
a container 28 that contains a liquid coupling medium 30.  
 One of the principal components and the main concern of this invention 
is the provision of an ultrasonic imaging lens system 32 for viewing a large field 
and focusing at a desired object focal plane 34. The prior art ultrasonic 
imaging lens system 32 focuses the ultrasonic energy onto a hologram detector 
surface 36. The ultrasonic imaging lens system 32 includes a large diameter 
object lens 38 that is moveable with respect to a large diameter
