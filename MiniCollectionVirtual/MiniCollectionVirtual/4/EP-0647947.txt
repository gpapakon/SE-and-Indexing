<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains in general to an erasable electrically
programmable memory cell (EEPROM) and its related driving circuitry, and
more particularly, to an EEPROM cell utilizing low voltage transistors.Conventional EEPROMs typically employ three to four transistors,
which include a tunnel diode device coupled to the floating gate of the sense
transistor to charge the latter and a select or row transistor to activate the
cell. The use of three or four transistors to realize a cell substantially limits
the size reduction possible for EEPROM arrays. Furthermore, typical
EEPROM cells require the application of voltages in excess of 15 volts. This
therefore requires special processing to reduce leakage and a larger layout to
avoid unwanted field transistor turn-on, i.e., the use of high voltage
transistors typically have longer channel lengths, and therefore, significantly
larger sizes. This is especially the case with respect to the row transistor,
since high voltage is applied to the source during the ERASE mode. The
peripheral driving circuitry also requires higher voltage transistors to handle
these high voltage driving signals.One technique for reducing the voltage is to utilize lower voltages
during the programming and the ERASE modes with use of an asymmetric
transistor. This is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,939,558, issued July 30, 
1990, which patent is incorporated herein by reference. U.S. Patent No. 4,939,558,
discloses an asymmetric memory cell that utilizes FowlerNordheim tunneling
techniques, whereby a reach-through region is provided on only one side of the
floating gate, such that the tunneling of electrons takes place only on the reach-through
side of the gate and, as such, creates an asymmetry in the transistor for the
purposes of both programming and erasure.US-A-5 021 847 (Eitan Boaz et al) 4 June 1991 discloses an EPROM array
with plural rows of split gate transistors, where each transistor includes a floating
gate and the floating gate has corner portions. A bit-line defining edge is formed on
each floating gate between two of the corners. The bit-line defining edges of first
and second floating gates respectively belonging to first and second rows are
patterned so that these edges protrude into opposed side areas of a bit line implant
window. In one example, the drain to source orientations of adjacent rows are
opposed.The present invention provides an electrically erasable, electrically
programmable Read Only Memory as claimed in Claim 1. In an example of the present
