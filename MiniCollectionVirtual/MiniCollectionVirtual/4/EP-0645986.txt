<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus comprising vertebral anchoring elements, e.g. a bone screw (1) or a hook (2), with a threaded cylindrical portion (5) and a locking plate (7). A nut (8) may be screwed onto the threaded cylindrical portion (5) to tighten the tightening portion of a slide (4) on a rigid connecting rod (3) with a circular cross-section. The rod (3), the slide (4) and the anchoring element (1, 2) may be sufficiently rigidly connected by means of non-slip projections on the engaged side of the locking plate (7), on the corresponding side of the slide (4), and on the surface thereof which surrounds the rod (3). The stiffness of the apparatus may thus be enhanced, whereby improved support of the vertebrae and easier fitting and adjustment of the apparatus may be achieved.
