<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for coding remotely 
detected gauges (10). At least two elements (13), the 

characteristics thereof being changed by an external 
magnetic field, are provided for forming said gauge (10), 

said gauge (10) being exposed to a biasing magnetic field 
covering a detecting volume that is larger than the gauge, 

and the characteristics of said elements (13) changed by 
said magnetic field, are detected. According to the 

invention the elements of each gauge (10) are oriented in 
predetermined mutual relationships to provide an identity 

of the gauge determined by said relationships. The elements 
are exposed to a sequence of different field distributions. 

The local field distribution of the biasing field over the 
gauge is continuously determined, and the mutual relationship 

between the elements is determined in dependence of 
the orientation of each element in the local field distribution 

by comparing actual properties of the elements 
influenced by the magnetic field, and expected properties 

of elements arranged in predetermined relationships to each 
other in the local field distribution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for coding
remotely detected gauges. Within trade and industry the
interest in non-optical and non-contact sensing of objects
have increased lately. In stores and superstores it is
interesting to read price labels and similar elements, and
within the industry it is desirable to read identification
labels in industrial material flows. A plurality of non-optical
and non-contact principles of identification of
labels are used at present. Most common is perhaps anti-theft
labels in shops.In a commonly used embodiment in trading labels are
used which are provided with a resonant circuit comprising
a capacitive and an inductive element. Said resonant
circuit can be forced to resonance by applying an
electromagnetic signal having a defined energy content at
the resonant frequency to said label in an interrogation
zone normally provided at the exit of the shop. A detection
device detecting signals from said resonant circuit at the
resonant frequency produces an alarm if a label provided
with an "activated" resonant circuit enters into said
interrogation zone. A practical embodiment of a resonant
circuit intended for this purpose is disclosed in US,A,4
578 654. A complete system includes also a device for
"deactivating" said label which is done on payment of the
merchandise to which the label is attached.A problem of all previously known labels used for the
purpose of limiting pilferage is a lack of ability of
individually identifying each label when a plurality of
labels are present simultaneously in said interrogation
zone. For the purpose mentioned the problem is not relevant
because an alarm should be delivered if a single label
or a plurality of labels having an "activated" resonant
circuit enter into said interrogation zone and are
detected. The method according to the present invention is
based on the fact that certain magnetic and mechanical
properties of elements shaped as tapes, wires or strips of
amorphous materials are changed when the elements are
exposed to a magnetic field, a so called bias field. The
position/direction of an element is for instance related to
the magnetic field in the longitudinal or axial direction
of the amorphous element, and the mechanical resonant
frequency of the element is a measure of the position/direction
of the element. Corresponding conditions apply
for a component comprising an amorphous element which is
magnetically coupled to an inductive element in turn
included in an electrical resonant circuit. When the
magnetic field is changed
