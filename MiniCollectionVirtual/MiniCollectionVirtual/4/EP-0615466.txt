A method for dedusting flue gases by means of an 
electrostatic filter (E, E1, E2), wherein the 

electrostatic filter positioned in the flue gas (R) is 
charged with a direct voltage U for the ionization of the 

dust particles passing through it, whereby the dust 
concentration is measured continuously at the exit of the 

electrostatic filter (E, E1, E2), an upper setpoint value 
and a lower setpoint value are predetermined for the dust 

concentration and are compared in a comparator (V) with 
one another, and whereby the upper setpoint value is 

determined by the maximally permitted dust concentration 
and the lower setpoint value by a predeterminable lower 

threshold of the dust concentration, characterized in that 
process parameters determined in advance as signals for 

the feedback control of the electrostatic filter (E) are 
derived from the comparator (V) experimentally for the 

difference of setpoint value and actual value from a 
memory (S) in a process which is optimal with respect to 

degree of dedusting and degree of efficiency, whereby the 
memory values are composed of several groups of parameters 

forming individual control stages, and whereby a 
decreasing power charge of the electrostatic filter (E) 

occurs with rising ordinal number of the control stages in 
such a way that when the dust concentration lies within 

the setpoint values the current control stage is 
maintained and that on exceeding the upper setpoint value 

the parameter of the next lower control stage is selected 
and on falling below the lower setpoint value the 

parameters of the next higher control stage are selected. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that for 
the feedback control of the electrostatic filter (E) the 

amount of the direct current, its rate of rise, its amount 
of lowering and its cycle ratio are used. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
separate memory sections are allocated to the functions of 

"preliminary filtering, intermediate filtering and post-filtering" 
of the electrostatic filter (E) in which a 

switch-over of the control stages occurs in a coupled 
manner. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3 in which several 
electrostatic filters are connected in parallel, 

characterized in that the switch-over of the control 
stages occurs in the memories or memory sections allocated 

to the individual electrostatic filters in a coupled 
manner, whereby the actual value for the dust 

concentration which is decisive for the feedback control 
occurs through arithmetic averaging of the dust 

concentrations measured at the respective filter exits. 
A method as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the dust concentration of the flue 

gases entering the smoke stack is measured as a further  
 

process value and that thereafter, when said value exceeds 
a predeterminable threshold, the lowest control stage is 

selected. 
A method as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the feed water quantity in the power 

plant is measured as a further process value and that 
thereafter, when it exceeds a predetermined lower 

threshold, the lowest control stage is selected. 
A method as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the switch-over from one control 

stage to the other occurs only after the expiration of a 
predeterminable waiting period. 
A method as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a monitoring for a breakdown of the 

measured value for the dust concentration is made in such 
a way that in case of non-existence of the measured value 

the lowest control stage is selected after the expiration 
of a predeterminable further waiting period.
