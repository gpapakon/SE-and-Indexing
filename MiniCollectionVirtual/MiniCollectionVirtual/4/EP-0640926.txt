<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a circular priority encoder comprising: a linear priority encoder (10) receiving a plurality of enquiries with indices 1 to n on corresponding enquiry lines (RQM), and acknowledging on an acknowledgement output (ACK) the enquiry of smallest index out of the enquiries reaching it; a masking register (12) linked so as to transmit to the linear encoder (10) only the enquiries whose indices are determined by the indices of active bits of a mask (M) contained in the masking register; and a mask generating circuit (14) supplying the masking register (12) with a mask whose bits of index 1 to i (i = 1, 3... n) are inactive and whose other bits are active when an enquiry of index i is acknowledged by the linear encoder.

<CLAIMS>
A circular priority encoder including:

a linear priority encoder (10) that receives a
plurality of requests of ranks 1 to n on corresponding

request lines (RQM), and acknowledges on an acknowledgment
output (ACK) the request of the lowest rank among the

requests that it receives;
a mask register (12) connected so as to transmit
to the linear encoder (10) only the requests whose ranks are

determined by the ranks of active bits of a mask (M) contained
in the mask register; and
a mask generator (14) generating a mask whose bits
of rank 1 to i (i = 1, 2... n) are inactive and the remaining

bits are active when a request of rank i is acknowledged by
the linear encoder;

   
characterized in that
 it includes means (18, 20) for
forcing to an active state selected bits of the masks (M)

provided by the mask generator (14), and it provides said
mask register (12).
The priority encoder of claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 it includes means (40, 42, 44) for authorizing the
loading of a mask in the mask register (12) only if the

acknowledged request corresponds to the bits that are not
forced to an active state of the masks.
The encoder of claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
mask register (12) includes an initialization input (S) that

is enabled when the acknowledgment output (ACK) of the linear
encoder (10) is at zero.
