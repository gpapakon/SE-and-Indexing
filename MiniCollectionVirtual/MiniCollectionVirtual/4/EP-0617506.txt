<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the driving of a stepping motor (4) having a required-value input unit (1), a control unit (2) and an output stage unit (3), which are connected to one another in series. The object is to prevent the stepping motor (4) blocking when the control unit (2) fails. This is done by the interposition of a dynamic stage (5) between the control unit (2) and the output stage unit (3), which dynamic stage emits inverted information to the output stage unit (3) a short time interval after or at the same time as preliminary information to the control unit (2), the resultant field vector turning to zero in the event of any residual reaction of the control unit (2), as a result of the [lacuna] sufficiently above the electrical corner frequency of the stepping motor windings. Applicable especially to throttle-valve control in motor vehicle technology.
