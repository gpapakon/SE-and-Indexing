<ABSTRACT>
A furnace (1) is provided for the heating of glass sheets (20,21) to be bent, 
whereby precise control of the temperature profile across a sheet may be achieved, 

resulting in improved control over the shape to which the sheet is bent. The furnace 
has at least one differential heating zone (S3,S4) provided with a plurality of main 

heating elements (37), characterised by a shield (35, 45, 115, 125), associated with 
said furnace and located in said zone (S3,S4) on the same side of a glass sheet to be 

bent as said heating elements (37), for directing heat radiated by said heating elements 
(37) whereby a controlled differential heating of the glass may be achieved. 
The invention also relates to a method of bending a glass sheet, and to a glass 
sheet bent in such a furnace.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a glass bending furnace, i.e. a furnace for
heating glass sheets to be bent, for the bending of glass sheets to complex shapes,
wherein precise control of the temperature profile across each glass sheet is required.
The invention also relates to a method of bending glass sheets employing such a
furnace.The shape to which a glass sheet is formed in any bending process is greatly
influenced by the temperature of the sheet, for the viscosity of the glass changes
rapidly with temperature. Moreover, temperature differences within the glass sheet
will similarly have a significant effect. It is therefore highly desirable to precisely
control the temperature profile across the sheet in order to successfully produce
particular shapes, and also to ensure reproducibility in mass production.It is known from EP-A- 504 117 to control the temperature profile across a glass
sheet in combination with a quenching step, so as to differentially toughen the sheet.A simple method of affecting the temperature profile in a glass sheet to be bent
is to place shields over those parts of the glass sheet which are to be heated to a lesser
degree, thereby shading those parts, i.e. blocking the heat from reaching them. In 
service, these shields become hot and themselves become secondary radiators of heat,
reducing their effectiveness. US-A- 4,687,501 in the name of PPG Industries Inc seeks to
alleviate this problem in the context of gravity bending by provision of secondary
shields to shade the glass from the hot primary shields. This is inevitably somewhat
cumbersome, and such shields would obstruct the automatic glass handling equipment
commonly used in modern factories to transfer the glass sheets from one stage of the
process to the next.Such shields are normally attached to a mould or other support which carries
the glass sheet, so that the shields travel with the glass sheet through the furnace, or
even the whole bending system. However, a typical glass bending system of the kind
in which the glass is heated in position on a mould contains many moulds, each of
which has to be equipped with the shields, so a large number of shields is required in
total, and any adjustment of the shields required on one mould may similarly be
required on every other mould. Since these shields can only be adjusted when a mould
is outside the furnace, the shading pattern created cannot change during the passage of
a glass sheet through the various heating sections in the furnace. This inflexibility is
now seen as
