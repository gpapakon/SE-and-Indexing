<ABSTRACT>
A method of spectrometry for measuring transient 
absorbance and transient absorption spectra of a 

substance to be measured at interfaces in the liquid 
phase of particulates containing a fluorescent pigment 

and the substance to be measured by the utilization of 
optical resonance phenomenon, and an apparatus therefor 

which comprises: 

(a) a pulse laser oscillator (2) for exciting the 
fluorescent pigment and the substance to be measured, 

respectively; 
(b) an optical delay device (3) for causing delay of 
any one of pulse laser beams of two kinds of wavelengths 

generated by said pulse laser oscillator; 
(c) a microscope system (4) for condensing laser beams 
generated by the pulse laser oscillator and irradiating 

the condensed beams to the sample; and 
(d) a detector (5) for detecting light emission of the 
sample. 
According to the method of the present invention, 
it is possible to measure transient absorbance and/or a 

transient absorption spectrum at a high sensitivity even 
when particulates containing the substance to be 

measured in the liquid phase are present.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
spectrometry. More particularly, the present invention
relates to a method of spectrometry which is useful for
spectrometric measurement of the surfaces of
particulates in such areas as the chemical, food,
pharmaceutical, materials and electronics industries.Analyzing physical properties and reaction
mechanisms at interfaces between particulates and the
surrounding medium thereof has now become a very
important problem for the development of new
technologies and new products in such various areas as
the chemical, food, pharmaceutical, materials and
electronics industries. For the purpose of analyzing
the status of such surfaces, spectrometry is usually
applied, and for this spectrometry, fluorescence
spectrometry and transient absorbance spectrometry are
known.However, fluorescence spectrometry, being a
measuring method permitting high-sensitivity
measurement, requires the substance to be measured to be
fluorescent. The scope of application of fluorescence
spectrometry is therefore limited.For transient absorbance spectrometry, on the other
hand, while it is applicable for analysis of
intermediate products of photochemical reactions, the
detection sensitivity is so low that, in measurement of
absorbance of a substance contained in particulates
having a particle size of the micrometer order, for
example, it is impossible to achieve a sufficient
absorbance because of the short optical path length.It has therefore been impossible to conduct
spectrometry permitting a high-accuracy analysis of 
particulate properties by the conventional fluorescence
spectrometry or transient absorbance method.The present invention was developed to solve these
problems in the conventional methods as described above,
and has an object to provide a novel method of
spectrometry which permits spectrometric measurement of
the condition of interfaces of particulates at a high
accuracy even when particulates containing a substance
to be measured are present in a liquid phase.According to the present invention there is
provided a method of spectrometry as claimed in claim 1.An embodiment of the invention will now be
described by way of example and with reference to the
accompanying drawings, in which:
Fig. 1 is a schematic view illustrating the
principle of measurement in the method of
the present invention;Fig. 2 is a schematic view illustrating an 
embodiment of the method of the present
invention; andFig. 3 is a graph illustrating the relationship
between the intensity of excited beam
