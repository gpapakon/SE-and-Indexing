<ABSTRACT>
Electrostatic spray gun in which the electrical path is in part through the fluid to be sprayed, the spray nozzle at least and optionally the fluid container as a whole being insulating and electrical connection being made with the fluid prior to its emergence from the nozzle, the fluid to be sprayed being expelled from the container (8) by a piston (56, 57) having a lubricating and sealing fluid (60) between axially inner and outer parts (56, 57).

<DESCRIPTION>
 SPRAY gÏ‹WThe invention relates to electrostatic spray guns.Many patents have been published on such guns, and further our previous patent application GB 92/01490 relates to them; it was filed 12th August 1992 and published as WO 93/03853 on 4th March 1993.In current work, we have tackled problems of satisfactory sealing of the fluid to be sprayed, within its container, as well as of ready, smooth advance of the piston under low pressure.The invention provides an electrostatic spray gun comprising a housing for receiving a replaceable fluid container, a nozzle from which fluid is to be sprayed, means for expelling fluid from the container, and a high voltage generator for applying electrostatic potential to the fluid to form an electrically charged atomised spray at the nozzle, wherein the container is rigid, and fluid is expelled from it by a piston under pressure exerted thereon through a forward part of the generator or otherwise, and wherein the piston is of axially inner and outer parts with a fluid lubricant seal provided between them.In one embodiment the inner and outer parts of the piston are separate, assembled with the lubricant between them. Alternatively however the piston is essentially in one piece, a circumferential reservoir for the lubricant separating the axially inner and the axially outer parts. A convenient lubricant, for a gun for paint, is glycerol/starch, providing an expendable reservoir of lubricant both sealing in the paint and preventing it drying round the piston if a container is part used, seizing it. 

 In such a gun the electrical path from the generator to the nozzle conveniently passes through the fluid to be sprayed, entering the fluid prior to its emergence from the nozzle, via the wall of the container or more conveniently through the piston.The container may thus be of insulating material, when electrical connection is through a piston of conducting material or at least having an electrical connection through it to the fluid.Alternatively for example, still providing for the electrical path to be through the fluid to be sprayed, the container, while externally insulating, may be of metal, making the required electrical connection with the generator interiorly, at a position remote from the nozzle, and providing a direct electrical path to the fluid within the container interior. The material of the piston itself is then unimportant.In a simple and convenient construction, in operation, the container and generator are drawn together to commence spraying, the

CLAIMS
1. An electrostatic spray gun comprising a housing for receiving a replaceable fluid container, a nozzle from which fluid is to be sprayed, means for expelling fluid from the container, and a high voltage generator for applying electrostatic potential to the fluid to form an electrically charged atomised spray at the nozzle, wherein the container is rigid and fluid is expelled from it by a piston under pressure exerted on the piston through a forward part of the generator or otherwise, and wherein the piston is of axially inner and outer parts with a fluid lubricant seal provided between them.
2. A gun according to claim 1, wherein the inner and outer parts of the piston are separate, assembled with the lubricant between them.
3. A gun according to claim 1, wherein the piston is essentially in one piece, a circumferential reservoir for the lubricant separating the axially inner and the axially outer parts.
4. A gun according to claim 1, 2 or 3 for spraying paint, wherein the lubricant is glycerol-starch.
5. A gun according to any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the electrical path from the generator to the nozzle passes through the fluid, entering the fluid prior to its emergence form the nozzle, via the wall of the container or through the piston.
6. A gun according to any of claims 1 to 5 wherein the container is wholly insulating, electrical connection to the fluid being through the piston. 


7. A gun as in any preceding claim wherein in operation, the container and generator are drawn together to commence spraying, the movement opening a valve for passage of fluid from the nozzle.
8. A gun as in claim 7 wherein front loading of the container into the gun simultaneously makes connection to the electrical path from the generator or places the container in a position where a short further movement opening a valve for passage of fluid from the nozzle also makes such contact.
9. A gun as in any preceding claim wherein pressure is applied to the container to expel the fluid by a handgrip acting through the intermediary of a variably pretensionable spring, the force necessary to overcome the pretension determining the minimum force that has to be exerted to actuate the handgrip and thus determining the minimum pressure applied to the fluid.
