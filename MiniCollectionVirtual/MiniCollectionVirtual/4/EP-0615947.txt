<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a filling machine for containers which have an annular boiler (2), which supports a plurality of filling elements (3) and is attached to a rotor (5), for the filling liquid. In order to permit intensive cleaning of the inside of the annular boiler, provision is made according to the invention for the annular boiler (2) to be supported on the rotor (5) via a plurality of extension arms (4) and for an annular clearance (6) which is interrupted by the extension arms and is open at the top and bottom to be formed between the annular boiler and the rotor.

Filling machine for vessels, with an annular reservoir 
(2) for the filling liquid which carries several filling 

members (3) and is mounted on a rotor (5), characterised in 
that the annular reservoir (2) is supported on the rotor 

(5) by several arms (4) and in that between the annular 
reservoir (2) and the rotor (5) is formed an annular free 

space (6) which is interrupted by the arms (4) and open at 
the top and bottom, and in that the rotor (5) comprises a 

circular outer edge of which the diameter is smaller than 
the inside diameter of the annular reservoir (2) more or 

less by the width of the free space (6). 
Filling machine according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the annular free space (6) is arranged concentrically 

to the axis of rotation (11) of the rotor (5). 
Filling machine according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the arms (4) extend essentially radially to the 

axis of rotation (11) of the rotor (5). 
Filling machine according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the arms (4) extend essentially 

horizontally. 
Filling machine according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the inner side of the free space (6) 

is defined by a protective wall (7) arranged at the height 
of the annular reservoir (2). 
Filling machine according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the protective wall (7) is formed by an essentially 

cylindrical metal sheet mounted on the rotor (5) 
concentrically to the axis of rotation (11) thereof. 
Filling machine according to claim 5 or 6, characterised  
 

in that inside the protective wall (7) on the annular or 
disc-shaped rotor (5) are arranged control devices (12, 13) 

for the filling members (3). 
Filling machine according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the rotor (5) is supported on a 

rotatably mounted support (9) which receives lifting 
members (8) for the vessels, wherein between the support 

(9) and the rotor (5) and/or the annular reservoir (2) is 
formed a free gap (10) into which leads the annular free 

space (6). 
Filling machine according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the support (9) is ring-shaped. 
Filling machine according to claim 9, characterised in 
that above the annular free space (6) is arranged at least 

one stationary spray nozzle (14) for a cleaning medium. 
Filling machine according to any of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that above the annular free space (6) are 

arranged several spray nozzles (14) for a cleaning medium 
rotating with the rotor (5). 
Filling machine according to any of claims 8 to 11, 
characterised in that the support (9) in the region beneath 

the annular free space (6) is provided with apertures (20). 
Filling machine according to any of claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that the annular reservoir (2), the rotor 

(5) and the free space (6) are located essentially at the 
same height. 
Filling machine according to any of claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that the outer side of the free space (6) 

is defined at least partially by a shield plate (15, 25) 
attached to the annular reservoir (2).  

 
Filling machine according to any of claims 1 to 14, 

characterised in that the free space (6) is free from 
moisture-sensitive fittings. 
Filling machine according to claim 14 or 15, 
characterised in that the free space (6) in the region 

below the annular reservoir (2) is closed off from the 
outside by a shield plate (25) attached to the annular 

reservoir (2) and/or a shield plate (24) attached to the 
support (9). 
Filling machine according to any of claims 6 to 16, 
characterised in that the space inside the protective wall 

(7) is shielded at the top by at least one cover (23, 26).
