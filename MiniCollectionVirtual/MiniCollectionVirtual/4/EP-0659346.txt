<ABSTRACT>
An extension of the shelf life of poultry carcasses is obtained by treating them before refrigeration with a treatment solution containing an alkali metal orthophosphate, for example trisodium orthophosphate.

<CLAIMS>
Use, in order to increase the period of preservation of poultry carcasses from 1 to 15
days, of a treatment process comprising the placing of the said poultry carcasses in

contact with a treatment solution containing 4% or more of trialkaline orthophosphate
relative to the weight of the solution on condition that the treatment solution does not

contain alcohol, the said treatment solution having a pH of at least 11.5, the said
treatment being carried out for an effective period in order to reduce the global number

of aerobic bacteria without affecting the organoleptic qualities of the poultry, the said
treatment taking place after evisceration and before refrigeration and including a rinsing

with water after the said treatment with trialkaline orthophosphate and before
refrigeration.
Use according to claim 1, 
characterized by
 the fact that the quantity of the said phosphate
is 8% or more relative to the weight of the solution.
Use according to claim 2, 
characterized by
 the fact that the said orthophosphate is
trisodium orthophosphate.
Use according to claims 1 to 3, 
characterized by
 the fact that the pH is between 12.0 and
13.5.
Use according to claims 1 to 4, 
characterized by
 the fact that the said poultry is treated at
a temperature of between 0째C and 70째C.
Use according to claim 5, 
characterized by
 the fact that the said poultry is treated at a
temperature of between 20째C and 45째C.
Use according to claims 1 to 6, 
characterized by
 the fact that the said poultry is treated
by an immersion or spraying process for a period of between one second and two hours.
Use according to claims 1 to 7 for the treatment of poultry carcasses comprising the
placing of the surface of the poultry, before refrigeration, in contact with an aqueous

treatment solution containing, for the most part, 4% or more of alkaline orthophosphate 
relative to the weight of the solution, the said treatment solution having a pH of between

12.0 and 13.5; the said treatment being carried out for an effective period in order to
reduce the global number of aerobic bacteria without affecting the organoleptic qualities

of the poultry, and consequently to increase its period of preservation.
