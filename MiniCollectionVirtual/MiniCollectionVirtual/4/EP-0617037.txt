<DESCRIPTION>
The current therapy for control of elevated intraocular 
pressure (IOP) or ocular hypertension which is believed to be a factor 
in the onset and progress of glaucoma is typically effected with a variety 
of topically applied agents which fall within four categories: β-blockers, 
sympathomimetic agents, parasympathomimetic agents and 
cholinesterase inhibitors. The adjuvant oral administration of a 
carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (CAI) is practised when the above-described 
topical agent's side effects limits its use and/or it fails to 
achieve adequate IOP control. The orally active CAI's can exhibit 
serious side-effects such as anorexia, gastrointestinal upset and 
parasthesias. Therefore an intense and ongoing search has been 
mounted for a topically active CAI that would not exhibit such side 
effects due to the route of administration and inherent target organ 
specificity. This search has resulted in the discovery of a class of 
compounds by Baldwin et al (US Patent 4,797,413) of general formula: 
 
   wherein R and R1 are lower alkyl, especially dorzolamide, wherein R is 
methyl and R1 is methyl. European Patent Specification No. 0 457 586 discloses similar 
compounds and the preparation thereof, including the preparation of a 
compound of the structural formula shown above in which R is methyl and 
R1 is n-propyl.  
 A synthesis of 5,6-dihydro-(S)-4-(ethylamino)-(S)-6-methyl-4H-thieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-2-sulfonamide-7,7-dioxide 
hydrochloride 
(dorzolamide hydrochloride) is described in the intermediate publication of 
Blacklock et al, J. Org. Chem., 1993, 58, 1672-1679 (published on 26th 
March 1993). The Ritter reaction is well-known in the art and consists of 
the treatment of an aliphatic hydroxyl with a nitrile and a strong acid to 
form an amide. 
The reaction proceeds through a carbonium ion at the point 
of attachment of the -OH so that if that is a chiral center in the starting 
material the chirality is lost during the reaction and a racemic product 
results. With the present invention the Ritter reaction is employed 
to introduce the nitrogen function at the 4-position of the molecule 
starting with a pure enantiomer and the chirality is unexpectedly 
retained in the product. This invention is concerned with a process for the synthesis 
of the dorzolamide type of compound in high yield and high 
enantiomeric purity. The key step in this novel process is a Ritter 
reaction with an unexpected and unprecedented tendency to proceed 
with retention of chirality. The novel process of the
