<ABSTRACT>
A separator/feeder 1 comprises a chute 18 for arranging 
a plurality of headed fasteners 4 in line, storing and 

feeding them, a shuttle 20 having a hollow for storing, a 
body 22 which supports the shuttle while allowing it to 

reciprocate and is attached with the chute, a 
piston-cylinder device 24 to reciprocate the shuttle between 

a first position of the body where headed fasteners are 
received in the storing hollow and a second position where 

headed fasteners are brought out to a discharge port, and a 
tube 25 to feed headed fasteners, their shanks first. A 

rotatable disc 27 provided in the body 22 sends headed 
fasteners standing upside-down into the storing hollow of 

the shuttle. A rack 32 and a pinion 30 function to link the 
rotation of the disc with the reciprocating movement of the 

shuttle so that headed fasteners can be received from a 
pocket 28 of the disc when the storing hollow of the shuttle 

is in the first position and headed fasteners can be 
received from the chute 18 into the disc pocket when the 

storing hollow of the shuttle is in the second position. 
The discharge port 23 for the fasteners faces toward the top 

surface of the body and the tube 25 for feeding fasteners 
extends beyond the top surface of the body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a headed fastener 
separator/feeder for separating and feeding headed fasteners 
fed in a row from a chute one by one. There is known a headed fastener separator/feeder for 
separating screws, T-studs or the like fed in a row from a 
chute one by one and feeding them to a pneumatic screw 
driver or a stud welder. A previously known headed fastener 
separator/feeder is described with reference to Figures 1 
to 3. A separator/feeder 1 for T-studs or other headed 
fasteners has a chute 2. The chute 2 stores a plurality of 
T-studs 4 standing in a row so that their shanks are 
received in a groove 3 with the heads positioned above the 
groove to send them toward an outlet. The feeder/separator 
1 is provided with a shuttle 7 having a storing cavity 6 
(Figures 2 and 3) to receive a single T-stud 4 from the 
chute 2. The shuttle 7 is supported by a body 8 in a manner 
that is reciprocated. The body 8 is provided with an outlet 
of the chute 2 to receive T-studs 4. On the body 8, a 
piston-cylinder device 11 is mounted to reciprocate the 
shuttle 7 between a first position in the body in which the 
storing cavity 6 receives a T-stud 4 from the chute 2 
(Figure 2) and a second position in the body in which the 
storing cavity 6 is positioned at a discharge port 9 for 
T-studs 4. A piston rod 12 of the piston-cylinder device 11 
is connected to the shuttle 7 to move reciprocatingly the 
shuttle 7 between the first position of Figure 2 and the 
second position of Figure 3. To the discharge port 9 of the 
body 8, a tube 13 is connected to feed T-studs 4 to a stud 
welder or the like with their heads being ahead. For 
feeding T-studs, the top surface of the body opposite to the 
discharge port 9 is provided with an air pipe 14 to supply 
pressurised air. When the separator/feeder 1 constructed as  
 
described above is at the first position of Figure 2 a 
single T-stud 4 is stored in the storing cavity 6 of the 
shuttle 7. Then, the shuttle 7 is moved to the second 
position of Figure 3 by the piston-cylinder device 11 and 
the T-stud 4 is fed into the tube 13 with its shank being 
ahead. The T-studs 4 are fed one by one to a stud welder or 
the like by reciprocating the shuttle 7. The known separator/feeder described above separates 
the headed fasteners one by one by reciprocating the shuttle 
with the shank being always ahead. Since this is suitable 
for automatic feeding to a stud welder, a pneumatic screw 
driver or the like, the separator/feeder is widely in use.

1 A separator/feeder for headed fasteners (4) comprising 
a chute (18) for receiving a plurality of headed fasteners 

arranged in a line with their shanks received in a groove 
(17) and their heads being above the groove and for feeding 

the fasteners toward an outlet, a shuttle (20) having a 
storing cavity (19) to receive a single headed fastener, a 

body (22) for reciprocatingly supporting the shuttle (20) 
and supporting the chute (18) to receive the headed 

fasteners (4), means attached to the body for reciprocating 
the shuttle (20) between a first position in the body (22) 

in which the storing cavity (19) receives a headed fastener 
from the chute and a second position in the body in which 

the storing cavity is positioned at a discharge port (23) 
for the headed fastener, and a tube attached to the 

discharge port to feed headed fasteners with their shanks 
being ahead, characterised in that a rotatable disc (27) is 

positioned in the body to pass between the outlet of the 
chute and the first position in which the headed fastener is 

received in the storing cavity of the shuttle under the 
disc, the disc being provided with a pocket (28) formed on 

the periphery of the disc to store the headed fastener so 
that the disc (27) turns over the headed fastener (4) 

received from the chute (18) to an upset orientation at the 
first position, and the rotation of the disc is associated 

with reciprocating movement of the shuttle so that the 
storing cavity of the shuttle receives the headed fastener 

from the pocket when the storing cavity (19) is at the first 
position and the disc receives a headed fastener from the 

chute into the pocket when the storing cavity is at the 
second position, and further the fastener discharge port 

(23) of the body is directed toward the top surface of the 
body.
