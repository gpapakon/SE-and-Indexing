<ABSTRACT>
A fixed logic level circuit with electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection is disclosed. The 
circuit contains two transistors, neither of which have their gates connected to the voltage 

source or ground lines. A logical high signal ("1") is outputted from the source of one 
transistor, while a logical low signal ("0") is outputted from the drain of the other 

transistor. The isolation of the logical high and low signals from the voltage source line 
and ground line protects this circuit and other circuitry using the logical high and low 

signals from voltage transients, such as ESD events. An additional transistor may be 
added to the circuit to prevent the circuit from entering an incorrect state.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the electronics circuitry field. More particularly, this invention is 
a circuit which provides ESD protected high and low fixed logic levels to other circuitry in 
a reliable manner. Modern digital circuitry is capable of performing a nearly unlimited number of useful and 
complex functions in response to the receipt of just two input signals -- a logical "high" 
signal ("1") and a logical "low" signal ("0") -- at appropriate places and times within the 
circuitry. In the absence of these input signals, this same marvelous circuitry is just 
glorified sand. In less colorful terminology, digital circuitry depends on a reliable source 
of logical high and low signals for proper operation. The flexibility and power of modern digital circuitry has meant that many mundane 
mechanical and electro-mechanical devices have been replaced with digital circuitry. For 
example, automobiles and airplanes are now almost entirely controlled by digital circuitry 
instead of by the tubes, relays, gears, levers, hydraulics and pneumatics of yesteryear. 
While this evolution has resulted in dramatically increased function at a dramatically lower 
cost and size, it has not been without its drawbacks. One such drawback is the 
susceptibility of digital circuitry to electrostatic discharge events, or ESD. ESD events 
can come from anything from static electricity to a lightning strike. Whether the ESD 
event comes from Kitty getting friendly with your computer or the gods deciding that 
aircraft really doesn't belong up in the sky during lightning storms, the results can be the 
catastrophic failure of the circuit.  It is a primary object of the invention to provide a circuit capable of supplying high and 
low fixed logic levels to other circuitry. It is another object of the invention to provide a circuit capable of supplying ESD 
protected high and low fixed logic levels to other circuitry. It is another object of the invention to provide a circuit capable of supplying ESD 
protected high and low fixed logic levels to other circuitry, where the circuit is prevented 
from entering an incorrect state. These and other objects of the invention are accomplished by the fixed logic level circuit 
with ESD protection disclosed herein. A fixed logic level circuit with electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection is disclosed. The 
circuit contains two transistors, neither of which have their gates connected to the voltage 
source or ground lines. A logical high signal ("1") is outputted from the source of one
