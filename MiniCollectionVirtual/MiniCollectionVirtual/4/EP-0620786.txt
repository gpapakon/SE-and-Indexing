<ABSTRACT>
Clamp having a U-shaped body (1) for inserting objects there between. Therein, one (2) of the legs is provided with a resilient lockable lip (4) for clamping the objects concerned between said lip (4) and the other leg (3) of the U-shaped body. In this arrangement, the hinge axis of said lip extends essentially at right angles to the longitudinal centre line of the web (7) of the U-shaped body. As a result, the clamp extends to a smaller extent over the width of the object to be clamped and over a greater length of the object to be clamped.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clamp according to the 
preamble of claim 1. Such a clamp is disclosed in US-A-4,241,477. The clamp shown 
therein is made from a relatively rigid thick material and the lip is 
from a resilient relatively thin material. In the description it is 
indicated that those parts might be integrally formed. Engagement of the 
lip to the related part of the leg is realized only by resilient 
deformation of this lip which snaps behind a protruding part of the 
related leg. This engagement can be realized by engaging a tab of the 
resilient lip. The object of the present invention is to avoid the 
abovementioned disadvantages. In the embodiment according to the invention, the U-shaped body is 
preferably elastically deformable such that the distance between the free 
locking end of the lip and the part of the one leg which can engage with 
it can be increased. That is to say that unlocking of the lockable lip is 
effected by bending the clamp, as a result of which the distance between 
the free end of the lip and the part of the one leg engaging therewith is 
increased such that unlocking is effected. Either the web of the U-shaped 
body or the one leg is provided with a weakened section in order to 
facilitate said bending. In addition, said bending may be facilitated by 
fitting a projection to the underside of the other leg. Consequently, the 
clamp has only to be pressed at both ends, which causes a bulge and moves 
the lockable lip out of the locked position if it is on a flat surface. According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the 
lip forms the partial outer boundary of the one leg of the U-shaped body. 
Thus it is possible significantly to simplify the operation of the 
lockable lip while, on the other hand, the width of the clamp can be 
limited further. Locking may be achieved by all methods known in the state of 
the art, but, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the  
 
locking end of the lip is provided with a recessed part and the part of 
the one leg which can engage with it is provided with an oppositely 
recessed part. Moreover, interacting fastening means, such as a tenon/mortise 
assembly, may be fitted on the lockable lip, on the one hand, and on the 
other leg, on the other hand. 
The clamp described above may be provided with suspension means 
in order not only to fix in the clamp one or more of the objects inserted 
in the clamp, but also to suspend them by means of the suspension means 
mentioned. The invention will be

<CLAIMS>
Clamp comprising a U-shaped body (1) for inserting objects 
therebetween, one (2) of the legs being provided with a resilient 

lockable lip (4) for clamping the objects between said lip (4) and the 
other leg (3) of the U-shaped body, wherein the hinge axis of the lip 

extends essentially at right angle to the longitudinal centre line of the 
web (7) of the U-shaped body (1), 
characterized in that
 the leg (2) in 
which the lip (4) is provided and at least the adjacent part of the web 

(7) are provided with a groove (9,8) such that the U-shaped body (1) is 
elastically deformable to increase the distance between the free locking 

end (5) of the lip and the part (6) of the one leg (2) to be engaged by 
the lip, and in that the free extremity of the lip engages said one leg 

in locked position. 
Clamp according to Claim 1, in which the lip (4) forms the 
partial outer boundary of the one leg (2) of the U-shaped body. 
Clamp according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the groove (8; 9) 
extends essentially perpendicular to the longitudinal centre line of the 

web. 
Clamp according to one of the preceding claims, in which the 
other leg (3) is provided with a projection (14), essentially half-way 

along, at the centre, on the side facing away from the other leg (2). 
Clamp according to one of the preceding claims, in which the 
free locking end (5) of the lip (4) is provided with a recessed part (11) 

and the part (6) of the one leg (2) which can engage with it is provided 
with an oppositely recessed part (12) in order to achieve the locking 

action. 
Clamp according to one of the preceding claims, in which the 
lip (4) and the other leg (3) are provided with interacting fixing means 

(10; 13). 
Clamp according to one of the preceding claims, in which the 
face of the lip (4), which faces the objects to be inserted, is designed 

with an inwardly curved part (20) for resiliently clamping said objects. 
Clamp according to one of the preceding claims, in which 
suspension means are fitted at the side of the web (7) facing away from 

the legs.
