<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 1,1'-binaphthyls, by reacting a 1-halonaphthalene which is substituted in position 2 and, if appropriate, in one or more of positions 3 to 7 by an alkyl, alkoxy or dialkylamino group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical and a 1-naphthylmagnesium halide which is substituted in position 2 and, if appropriate, in one or more of positions 3 to 7 by an alkyl, alkoxy or dialkylamino group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical in a non-polar solvent of 30 to 150 DEG C in the presence of palladium and a phosphine of the general formula
