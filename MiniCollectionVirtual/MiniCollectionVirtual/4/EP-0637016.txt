<ABSTRACT>
A disk-shaped recording medium (2) includes a transparent 
substrate (5), and an optical recording layer (4) formed on the transparent 

substrate (5). A light source emits light. An optical head (6) is operative 

for applying the light to the optical recording layer from the light 
source via the transparent substrate, for focusing the light on the 

optical recording layer, and for reproducing information from the 
optical recording layer. A position detecting device is operative for 

detecting at least one of a pit depth and a physical position of 
information which has a first given relation with a specified address 

and which is recorded on the recording medium, and for generating 
first positional information representing at least one of the pit 

depth and the physical position. A previously-recorded secret code (538) 
is reproduced (534) from the recording medium. The secret code 

represents second positional information. The secret code is 
decoded into the second positional information. The second 

positional information represents at least one of a predetermined 
reference pit depth and a predetermined reference physical 

position. The first positional information and the second positional 
information are collated (535), and a check is made as to whether or not 

the first positional information and the second positional 
information are in a second given relation. When the first positional 

information and the second positional information are not in the 
second given relation, one of outputting of a reproduced signal of 

the recording medium, operation of a program stored in the 
recording medium, and decoding of the secret code is stopped.

facing the magnetic recording portion of the recording medium for
recording and reproducing information into and from the magnetic
recording portion, and a mechanism for moving at least one of the 
optical head and the magnetic head in accordance with rotation of the recording
medium. In the apparatus of Japanese patent application 2-179951, during the
processing of the information read out from the magnetic recording portion, a
decision is made as to whether or not the information recorded on the optical
recording portion is necessary, and a step of reading out the information from the
optical recording portion is executed when the information on the optical recording
portion is decided to be necessary.NL-9101358 describes an authenticity mark for CDs in which an area of randomly
disposed marking elements forms a random code.Patent Abstracts of Japan relating to JP-A-62-205 580 discloses an optical disk in
which different data is encoded with different keys.According to the present invention, there is provided a reproducing apparatus for use
with a disk-shaped recording medium which includes a transparent substrate and an
optical recording layer formed on the transparent substrate, the apparatus comprising:
a light source for emitting light; andan optical head for applying the light to the optical recording layer from the
light source via the transparent substrate, for focussing the light on the optical
recording layer, and for reproducing information from the optical recording layer;
