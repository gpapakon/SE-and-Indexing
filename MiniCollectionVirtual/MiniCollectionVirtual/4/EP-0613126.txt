<ABSTRACT>
The optical information recording medium according to the present invention 
is capable of recording information at an extremely high density and 

reading the information at a high speed by providing at least one cell having a 
diffraction grating on a planar substrate; dividing the cell into 
n
 (
n
 is 2 or a 
greater integer) regions so that each of the divided cells displays one set of binary 

data; providing light receiving elements the number of which corresponds 
to that 
n
 by which the cell is divided, for use in reading the information; 
applying one beam of light to the cell; and receiving by the light receiving 

elements the refracted light from the divided cells, whereby the data are 
reproduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
information recording medium from which information is
optically reproduced and an information reading method
for the same and, more particularly, to an optical
information recording medium which uses diffraction
gratings as information recording elements so that
information can be recorded at a very high density and
from which a plurality of pieces of information are read
at once simultaneously so that information can be read
at a higher speed, and an information reading method for
the same.Generally, optical recording has advantages in
that, e.g., a recording medium and a head do not contact
each other when compared to magnetic recording, and
high-density recording can be performed. Various types
of media are known as optical recording media for optical
recording, e.g., a read-only medium, a write-once
medium, and an erasable programmable medium.Optical recording media of these types have already
been in practical use in various fields in the forms of,
e.g., an optical recording disk (e.g., a CD, a CD-ROM,
a CD-I, a laser disk, write-once and programmable disks, 
and a magneto-optical disk) and an optical card (e.g., a
ROM card, write-once and programmable cards, and a
magneto-optical card).In a conventional read-only or write-once optical
recording disk, a laser beam generated by a light
source, e.g., a semiconductor laser, is focused to
form a spot having a diameter of 1 to 2 µm on the disk
surface, and the surface state of the corresponding portion
on the disk surface is detected by utilizing light
reflected by the disk surface.More specifically, when a pit is present, light is
randomly reflected to reduce the intensity of the
reflected light. When a pit is not present, light is
reflected by a mirror surface. Data is read by utilizing
a difference (intensity of light) between these two
states.In this case, however, a decrease in spot diameter
of the laser light beam is limited to as small as about
1 to 2 µm, and it is impossible to decrease the spot
diameter to be extremely smaller than this.Accordingly, the information amount of the conventional
optical recording disk is limited by the fact
that one pit on the disk represents one piece of information
and by the limited spot diameter of the laser
light beam. As a result, information recording at a
high density exceeding a certain limit cannot be
performed.In US-A-5 032 033 a recording medium is disclosed comprising a cell which contains a plurality of
diffraction gratings disposed on a planar substrate.
