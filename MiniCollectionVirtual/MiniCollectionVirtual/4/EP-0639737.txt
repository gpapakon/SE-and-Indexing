<ABSTRACT>
An underground conduit for water, gas or the like is closed and opened by a fitting (1) with a pneumatic actuating unit (2) mounted on top. In a closed position, a switching valve (42) connects an accumulator (6) to a region situated above a piston (14) displaceable in a cylinder, while the region situated underneath the piston (14) is connected via the switching valve (42) and an adjustable throttle valve (50a) to an outlet. To open the fitting, the switching valve (42) is switched over so that the region situated underneath the piston (14) is connected to the accumulator (6) and the region situated above the piston (14) is connected via an adjustable throttle valve (50b) to an outlet, with the result that the piston (14) is raised. The accumulator (6), the pressure of which can be read off from a manometer (47), can be replenished by way of a quick connection (49). End positions of the piston (14) are detected by magnetic switches (29a, b) and indicated by indicating elements (59a, b). All the connections and indicating devices are combined in one operating unit which is arranged above ground in an actuating unit, as is preferably also the switching valve (42) and a control unit (61), an accumulator (60) and solar cells (62). Instead of being supplied by means of an external connection or an accumulator (6), the pressure can be supplied by means of a feed connection on the conduit upstream of the fitting (1). The drive unit can also be driven hydraulically or electrically. The fitting can be remote-controlled, e.g. by radio control.

A device for closing and opening a fitting (1) which is
buried underground by means of a drive unit (2) attached

thereto, characterised in that the said device comprises an
operating unit (4), spatially separate from the drive unit

(2), which is arranged at least partially on or above the
ground and is connected to the drive unit (2) by at least one

continuous connecting line (3) which serves to convey energy
or control signals to operate the fitting (1), the said drive

unit containing a pneumatic or hydraulic drive comprising an
element which may be displaced by the action of pressure on

one side thereof and at least one first connection (21a) which
may be acted upon by pressure from a pressure source to

operate the fitting (1) by way of a pilot valve (42) operable
from the operating unit (4).
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that a
connection for supplying pressure from the outside is arranged

on the operating unit (4) to serve as the pressure source.
A device according to claim 2, characterised in that the
connection is a quick-release connection (49) comprising a

non-return valve.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that a pressure reservoir (6) is provided as the pressure

source.
A device according to claim 4, characterised in that the
pressure reservoir (6) is connected to a connection on the

operating unit (4).
A device according to claims 3 and 5, characterised in
that the pressure reservoir (6) is connected to the quick-release

connection (49). 
A device according to one of claims 3 to 6, characterised
in that it includes at least one mobile pressure reservoir

(52) with a connector (55) which forms a quick-release
coupling with the quick-release connection (49), which

coupling may be opened by pushing the connector (55) onto the
quick-release connection (49) and at the same time is sealed

from the outside.
A device according to claim 7, characterised in that the
own weight of the mobile pressure reservoir (52) produces a

bearing pressure between the connection piece (55) and the
quick-release connection (49) which is sufficient to open the

quick-release coupling.
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that a
feed connection (63) on the underground fitting which is

arranged upstream of the fitting (1) serves as the pressure
source.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised
in that the pilot valve (42) is at least a 3/2-way valve which

can connect at least the first connection (21a) of the drive
unit (2) to an outlet.
A device according to claim 10, characterised in that the
action of pressure on the first connection (21a) of the drive

unit (2) causes the underground fitting to open and the drive
unit (2) has at least one second connection (21b) on which the

action of pressure causes the fitting to close, and the pilot
valve (42) is at least a 4/2-way valve which can connect the

first connection (21a) to the pressure source and at the same
time the second connection (21b) to an outlet, or the second

connection (21b) to the pressure source and at the same time
the first connection (21a) to an outlet.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that the drive unit (2) has at least one 

locking mechanism to secure the displaceable element in an end
position.
A device according to claim 12, characterised in that the
at least one locking mechanism is a snap-action locking

mechanism.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 12,
characterised in that the drive unit (2) contains a spring

arrangement (66) to act on the displaceable element with a
force which is directed towards a base position.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 14,
characterised in that the drive unit (2) comprises at least

one limit switch which is connected to an indicating element
(56a, 59b) on the operating unit (4) to

indicate whether the displaceable element is in an end
position.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 15,
characterised in that any valves which are fitted in the

operating unit (4) are arranged on or underneath the ground.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 16,
characterised in that the operating unit (4) has an operator's

unit (38) arranged above the ground on which all the possible
connections, operating elements for operating valves and

indicating elements are arranged.
A device according to claim 17, characterised in that the
operating unit (4) comprises an upper part (37) located above

ground which contains the operator's unit (38), and a lower
part (34), anchored in the ground and projecting at most

slightly thereabove, to which the upper part (37) is connected
