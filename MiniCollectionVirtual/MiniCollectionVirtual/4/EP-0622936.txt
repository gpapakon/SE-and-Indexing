<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for granting to one telephone customer the 
features of another such customer. The first (remote) customer is connected to the 

switching system providing service to the second (home) customer. After the remote 
customer is duly authorized, the block of data defining the features allocated to the 

home customer is associated with the call control process for serving the remote 
customer. Advantageously, using such an arrangement, calls by the remote may be 

billed to the account of the home customer and all features that are available to the 
home customer are made available for use by the remote customer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the provision of special features and 
capabilities to telecommunications customers. Special services such as custom features for individual telephone 
subscribers are becoming increasingly prevalent and increasingly important in the 
modern generation of program controlled switching systems. Such custom features 
include, but are not limited to, abbreviated dialing lists, allowance of access to a toll 
network, allowance of access to special private lines, special billing, allowance of 
access to services provided by intelligent peripherals, allowance of access to 
intelligent networks. Such services are tied to a particular telephone customer's 
terminal port on a switching system by means of a static data block of information 
provided for the customer served by that terminal port. A problem of the prior art is 
that the features which have been provided for a particular customer served by that 
terminal port are accessible to that customer only when he is using a telephone 
instrument connected to that terminal port and are not available to other customers 
unless these other customers have ordered similar features. The above problem is solved and an advance is made over the prior art 
in accordance with my invention wherein one telephone customer, hereinafter called 
the remote customer, is granted the features of the telephone terminal port, 
hereinafter called the home terminal port, associated with another customer, the 
home customer, by connecting the remote customer to a switch serving the home 
customer terminal port and providing the remote customer with a static data block of 
the home customer, required to access all features which are accessible to the home 
customer through dialing. Examples of such features are ability to make toll calls, 
conference call, call forwarding for incoming calls to the home terminal port, access 
to intelligent peripherals for, for example, voice dialing, abbreviated dialing (speed 
calling), special billing, and priority calling. A remote customer (caller) dials an 
access code and an identification of the home terminal port; in response a connection 
is set up between the remote customer and a shadow terminal port on the switch of 
the home terminal port, and the shadow terminal port is then associated with the 
static data block of the home terminal port. All permissions associated with that 
home terminal port, including permissions to alter specific portions of the home  
 
terminal port's static data block, are then also

<CLAIMS>
A method of providing services, said services defined in a block of 
data and granted to a first customer connected to a first terminal port on a switching 

system, to a second customer, comprising the steps of: 
   connecting said second customer to said switching system via a terminal 

port other than said first terminal port; and 
   associating said block of data with the connection to said switching 

system, wherein call control signals received over said connection are treated in the 
same way as signals received on said first terminal port. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said associating comprises: 
   receiving preliminary signals over said connection, said preliminary 

signals comprising signals for data for identifying said first customer. 
The method of claim 2 wherein said preliminary signals further 
comprise signals for data for requesting authorization to receive said services granted 

to said first customer. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said associating comprises: 
   providing a call processing block for a terminal port of said connection; 

and 
   initializing said call processing block with data for identifying said 

block of data for defining services of said first customer. 
The method of claim 1, further comprising: 
   charging a customer who is charged for connections from said first 

terminal port for connections of said second customer originated from said 
connection. 
The method of claim 1 further comprising: 
   extending said connection to another port; and 

   associating a block of data defining the services of a third customer, 
whose home terminal port is a second terminal port, with said extended connection, 

wherein signals received on said extended connection are treated in the same way as 
signals received on said second terminal port. 
The method of claim 6 further comprising: 
   charging a customer who is charged for connections from said second 

terminal port for connections of said second customer originated from said extended 
connection. 
The method of claim 6 wherein said further associating comprises 
extending said connection to another terminal port of the same or another switching 

system. 
The method of claim 1 comprising: 
   granting said services to a third customer at the same time that they are 

granted to said second customer. 
The method of claim 9 wherein granting said services to said third 
customer comprises granting said services to a second call appearance by said 

second customer. 
In a switching system, apparatus for providing services, said services 

defined in a block of data of said system and granted to a first customer connected to 
a first terminal port of said system, to a second customer, comprising: 

   means for receiving a call from said second customer; and 
   means, responsive to said means for receiving said call, for associating 

said block of data with a call connection of said call; 
   wherein call control signals received over said call connection are 

treated in the same way as signals received on said first terminal port. 
The apparatus of claim 11 wherein said means for associating further 
comprises means for receiving preliminary signals over said call connection, said 

preliminary signals comprising signals for data for identifying said first customer 
and signals for data for requesting authorization to receive said services granted to 

said first customer.
