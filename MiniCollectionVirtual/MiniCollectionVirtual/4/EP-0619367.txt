<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to solid lavatory cleansing 
blocks containing enzymes. The block is designed to have good 
stain removal capacity. Lavatory blocks for cleansing and deodourizing the lavatory 
bowl are well known in the art. Such lavatory blocks typically 
comprise surfactants and chlorinating compounds which provide 
the desired cleansing and deodourizing properties. However, the lavatory blocks disclosed in the prior art do 
not efficiently address the problem of stain removal of  
 
physiological soils which are frequently found in the lavatory 
bowl. The surfactants contained in the lavatory blocks on the 
market are not present in sufficiently high concentrations in 
order to achieve optimum improved stain removal. Chlorinating 
agents due to their bleaching action are known for their stain 
removal ability. The in-bowl stain removal action of said 
chlorinating agents is limited at low concentrations. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide 
an efficient stain and grease removal system incorporated in a 
solid lavatory block which is completely environmentally safe. In response to these objectives, the present invention 
proposes to formulate a lavatory block comprising an enzyme 
system as a stain removal active. The blocks according to the present invention progressively 
dissolve in water, thereby releasing the ingredients in 
solution. Thus, a permanent aqueous solution is provided in the 
lavatory bowl which comprises a constant and predetermined 
amount of various ingredients. An advantage of the present invention is that the enzymes are 
permanently active in the lavatory bowl water during the whole 
period in between lavatory flushes. The present invention is a solid lavatory block characterized 
in that it comprises from 0.1% to 50% of an enzyme system, 
whereby said lavatory block provides a permanent aqueous 
solution comprising an effective amount of said enzyme system 
as said block is progressively dissolved in said lavatory bowl 
water. All ratios, percentages and parts given herein are "by 
weight" unless otherwise specified.  The present invention relates to a solid lavatory cleansing 
block. There are two types of lavatory blocks available on the 
market at present, in-rim and in-cistern type lavatory blocks. 
The in-rim type blocks are distinct from in-cistern type blocks 
in that they are designed to be hung from the rim of the 
lavatory bowl, in a conventional type rim cage. The in-cistern 
type blocks are designed to be placed in the
