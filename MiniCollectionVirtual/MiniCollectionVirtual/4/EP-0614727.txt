<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses an automatic belt-inserting device 
for honing machines comprising a leading casing (2; 102; 

302) for the sliding insertion of the belts (72; 201; 372) 
between the rotating cylinders (71; 171; 202) of a honing 

machine (7; 107) and a moving element (4; 104; 304) to 
which said leading casing (2; 102; 302), is hinged and able 

to slide along a driving unit (5; 105; 305) attached to a 
supporting structure (6; 106; 306). The belt-inserting 

device is provided with means for the displacement (42) of 
the moving element (4; 104; 304) along said driving units 

(5; 105; 305) and with means for the rotation (22) of said 
leading casing (2; 102; 302) around the hinging point (3), 

said means being suited to bring said leading casing (2; 
102; 302) parallel with the external surface of the cylinder 

of the honing machine (71; 171) into which the belt 
(72; 201; 372) is to be inserted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns an automatic belt-inserting device 
for the insertion of sand or lamellar belts between the 
rotating cylinders of a honing machine. It is a known fact that the lapping operations on wooden 
materials, either rough or varnished, are performed by 
means of honing machines on which the material to be 
smoothed is placed over a conveyor belt which conveys it 
under of a plurality of sand belts, each of them being 
wrapped around rotating cylinders. The granulometry and the type of abrasive material depend 
on the working operation to be performed, therefore, the 
sand belts are replaced both depending on the type of 
product to be smoothed and on the degree of finish which 
needs to be obtained on such product. Moreover, sometimes, each sand belt is pushed against the 
piece to be smoothed through a lamellar belt interposed 
between the cylinder around which the sand belt is wound 
and the back of the sand belt itself. It is a known fact to the operators of this field, that the 
replacement of the sand belts and of the lamellar belts is 
a rather long operation both because it is performed manually 
and because the operator is forced to work in a 
rather uncomfortable position, given the dimension of the 
belts and the position of the honing machine, where the 
rotating cylinders on which the belts are wound are mounted. Moreover, if one considers that the current trends of the 
market force the users of the honing machine, such as 
furniture-makers, to produce lots of limited quantity in a 
high number of colour variations and superficial finishes, 
it is easy to understand how the machine idle times for the 
replacement of the belts can become very long, thus having 
a considerable effect on the machine tooling time, and 
therefore on the total cycle time.  
 In order to replace the belts, it is necessary to remove 
them from the cylinders, around which they are wound, then 
to insert in their place other belts having proper characteristics 
for the product to be obtained. In such a replacement operation what happens to be particularly 
difficult is to fit each belt on the corresponding 
top winding cylinder. It is with the purpose of facilitating the replacement 
operations of the belts and in particular the fitting 
operation of each belt on the corresponding top cylinder, 
that the patent for industrial invention which makes the 
object of the Italian patent application No. VI92A000082, 
in the name of the same inventor, has been realized, which 
describes a leading casing for
