<ABSTRACT>
The invention is intended for use with purses, pouches, bags, haversacks, document holders, etc., and is designed to hold the bag or holder and its contents securely in place during active movement, to distribute the weight of the bag over the body, and to effectively dampen heavier blows. The device has an elastic belt (D) which is fitted around the waist and a shoulder strap (A). There are fastenings along the belt at points (F and B). The bag attaches to the belt and to the strap and slides freely along the belt. The bag is placed most conveniently at the front of the body.

<DESCRIPTION>
When a person is running his body is moving continously
up and down a weight carried in a bag affects the motion of
the bag and thereby the body.
a) The body has completed its downward and start its
upward movement from the lowest position;
Fdn= Ft + Fi - Ff=
= m (g+Aup) + m W2 dn/2s - Ffb) The body starts to fall from the highest position;
Fup= -Ft + Fi - Ff=
= - m (g-Adn) + m W2 up/2s - Ff
Where:
Ft = gravitational forceFi = inertial forceFf = frictional forcesAup = acceleration of the body in upward movementAdn = acceleration of the body in downward movementWup = velocity of the weight in upward movementWdn = velocity of the weight in downward movementm = mass of the weights = displacement, distance, there inertial forces act
to stop the downward or upward movement of the weight
and to direct it downward or upward again.The document USA 4,878,606 presents a device comprising
a waist belt, a shoulder strap, an adjustable underarm
strap. A bag is supported by waist belt by means of a
multiple belt loop system adjacent the user's hip.The human body is continuosly moving. A bag has to
follow the complecated movement of the body. The
presented device does not provide appropriate directed
elasticity to hold a bag and its contents securely in
place with a minimum impact to the body during the
complicated movements. In the case the bag is fixed too
tight or too loose to the body of user it
creates discomfort and even injury by long time use
with heavier loads.The presented device has a diagonnally crossing
shoulder strap and underarm strap to hold the shoulder
strap in its proper place, which is a result of lacking
elasticity. The tight waist belt does not allow to
distribute weight automatically and accordingly to
movements.The shoulder strap is attached to the ends of the bag. In ordinary devices the weight of a load is not fixed in its
position inside of bag and will move with a greater
velocity than the bag. Thus Fi consists of two
components, i.e. the mass and
velocity of the weight contributing the inertial force
When these forces become sufficiently strong the weight
and the bag begin to move relative to the body. When
displacement s becomes sufficiently great the weight
creates a discord relative to the motion of the body.In this way the weight and the bag fall out of the step
with the motion of the body which the carrier
experiences as an unpleasent bouncing movement.
Displacement s becomes even greater.If it is necessary to carry paper or documents in format up to A4, to move around
freely and to
