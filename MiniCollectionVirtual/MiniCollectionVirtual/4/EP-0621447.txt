<ABSTRACT>
The steam-generator combustion chamber has vertical walls which possess parallel tubes (2) ascending at a low inclination relative to the horizontal. The tubes (2) are welded to one another in a gas-tight manner by means of fins (7). A plurality of vertical supporting bands (3) bearing on the tubes (2) are provided in a manner distributed over the wall width. Each supporting band (3) has in its middle a plurality of long holes (4) which are distributed over its length and in each of which is arranged a connecting element in the form of a sheet-metal strip (5) cut out in a comb-like manner. Each sheet-metal strip is welded on the one hand to the tubes (2) and webs (7) adjacent to it and on the other hand to the supporting band (3).

Steam generator combustion chamber (1), the
vertical walls of which have parallel tubes (2) which run

at a low ascending gradient relative to the horizontal
and which are welded to one another in a gas-tight manner

via webs or fins (7), there being provided, distributed
over the wall width, a plurality of vertical supporting

bands (3) which rest against the tubes (2) and which are
welded to the tube wall via connecting elements,

characterized in that each supporting band (3) has a
U-shaped cross-section, the web of the U-profile resting

against the tube wall, and in that the supporting band
(3) has in the middle of it a plurality of long holes (4)

which are distributed over its length and in each of
which is arranged a connecting element in the form of a

sheet-metal strip (5) which is cut out in a comb-like
manner and which is welded both to the supporting band

(3) and to the tubes and webs or fins (7) adjacent
thereto.
Combustion chamber according to Claim 1,
characterized in that each long hole (4) is dimensioned

so as to be somewhat longer than the length of the
associated sheet-metal strip (5).
Method for the production of a steam generator
combustion chamber (1), the vertical walls of which have

parallel tubes (2) which run at a low ascending gradient
relative to the horizontal and which are welded to one

another in a gas-tight manner via webs or fins (7), there
being provided, distributed over the wall width, a

plurality of vertical supporting bands (3) which rest 
against the tubes (2) and which are welded to the tube

wall via connecting elements, and each supporting band
(3) having a U-shaped cross-section, the web of the

U-profile resting against the tube wall and each supporting
band (3) having in the middle of it a plurality of

long holes (4) which are distributed over its length and
in each of which is arranged a connecting element in the

form of a sheet-metal strip (5) which is cut out in a
comb-like manner and which is welded both to the supporting

band (3) and to the tubes (2) and webs or fins (7)
adjacent thereto, supporting bands (3) provided with long

holes (4) being placed onto the outside of the tube wall
welded together from tubes (2) and webs (7) or from

finned tubes, and each long hole (4) having inserted into
it a sheet-metal strip (5) which is provided with comb-like

cutouts and which is connected to the tube wall by
tack welding, the supporting bands (3) then being removed

and the sheet-metal strips (5) being firmly welded to the
tube wall, the supporting bands (3) thereafter being

placed onto the tube wall a second time, the sheet-metal
strips (5) passing through the long holes (4), and,

finally, the welded connection between the sheet-metal
strips (5) and the supporting bands (3) being made by

pressing the supporting bands (3) onto the tube wall.
