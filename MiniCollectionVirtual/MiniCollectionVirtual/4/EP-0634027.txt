<ABSTRACT>
A developer (10) for sheets of dry silver media (19) includes an oven having a film entrance (30) and a film exit (32). A bed of spaced rollers of low thermal conductivity foam material (28) is positioned within the oven between the entrance and exit. A roller drive mechanism (18) rotates the rollers causing the film to be transported through the oven and developed without visible patterns.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is a method and apparatus for developing sheets of 
thermophotographic or heat developable film. Thermophotographic film typically includes a thin polymer or paper base 
coated with an emulsion of dry silver or other heat sensitive material. Once the 
film has been imaged, it is developed through the application of heat. Devices and 
methods for developing thermophotographic film are generally known and 
disclosed, for example, in the following U.S. Patents: 
Inventor Patent No. Svendsen3,629,549 Brewitz 3,648,019 Kreitz et al.3,709,472  Svendsen 4,518,845   The Svendsen U.S. Patents 3,629,549 and 4,518,845 both disclose 
developers having thermally insulating drums concentrically mounted within a 
heating member. Sheets of film to be developed are engaged by the drum and 
driven around the heating member. Unfortunately, developers of this type are 
relatively complicated and poorly suited for use with film having soft emulsions. 
Since the side of the film bearing the emulsion will contact either the insulating 
drum or the heating member, the film is subject to damage by sticking or 
scratching. The development device disclosed in the Kreitz et al. U.S. Patent 
3,709,472 uses a heated drum to develop strips of film, and is not suitable for 
single sheets of film having soft emulsion layers. The Brewitz U.S. Patent 3,648,019 discloses a developer with a pair of 
heaters on opposite sides of a low thermal mass locating device such as a screen 
assembly. Although it is portable, this developer is relatively slow and poorly 
suited for commercial applications.  
 Other thermophotographic film developers include a heated drum which is 
electrostatically charged to hold the film thereon during development. Since the 
side of the film bearing the emulsion is not in contact with the drum or other 
developer components, it is not subject to sticking or scratching as in some of the 
developers discussed above. Unfortunately, the electrostatic system used to hold 
the film on the drum during development is relatively complicated and poorly 
suited for developers configured to develop larger sized sheets of film. The 3M Model 261 and 262 thermal diazo processor system uses a belt to 
transport the film as it is being heated. The belt is a relatively hard, 
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coated fiberglass member. The 3M Model 1500 thermal diazo processor develops rolls of film by 
transporting the film over a hot drum, in a manner similar to that disclosed in the 
Kreitz et al. patent

<CLAIMS>
A developer (10) for sheets of thermophotographic film (19), 
including: 


an oven (16) having a film entrance (30) and a film exit (32); 
a generally flat and horizontally oriented film supporting bed (12) of film support material including at 
least three spaced rollers (20) of said film support material rotatably mounted within the oven along a 

film transport path between the film entrance and film exit, for engaging 
and supporting the film; and 
a drive mechanism (18) for driving the bed of material to transport the 
film through the oven along the transport path, wherein the drive 

mechanism includes a roller drive mechanism for rotating the 
rollers and causing the rollers to transport the film through the oven 

along the transport path; characterized in that 
the film support material has a sufficiently low heat capacity to enable 
visible pattern-free development of the film as the film is 

transported through the oven. 
The developer of claim 1 wherein the film support material is a 
foam material. 
The developer of claim 1 wherein the film support material has a 
thermal conductivity less than about 0.96 Wm
-1

-1
 (1 BTU/h ft F). 
The developer of claim 1 wherein the film support material is a 
foam material having a density less than about 48 kg/m
3
. 
The developer of claim 1 wherein the oven includes heat sources 
(42,44) above and below the rollers. 
The developer of claim 1 wherein the oven includes a plurality of 
independently controlled temperature zones. 
The developer of claim 1 wherein the rollers include cylindrical 
tubes of the film support material around a core (26).  

 
A method for developing sheets of thermophotographic film (19) 
having an emulsion on one side, including; 


supporting the film in a hot oven (16) on a generally flat and 
horizontally oriented bed (12) of material (28) including at least 

three rollers of the material having a sufficiently low heat capacity 
to enable visible pattern-free development of the film; and 
driving the bed of material by rotating the rollers to transport the film 
through the oven as the film is being developed. 
The method of claim 8 wherein supporting the film includes 
supporting the film on the rollers with the emulsion toward the rollers. 
The method of claim 8 wherein supporting the film includes 
supporting the film on a bed of foam rollers having a thermal conductivity less 

than about 0.96 Wm
