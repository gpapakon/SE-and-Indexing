<ABSTRACT>
A device is provided for increasing the surface 
area of the gas generant used in an automotive safety air 

bag module (50). Depending on crash conditions, the 
surface area of the gas generant is increased by shattering 

the gas generant wafers (80). One embodiment utilizes a 
squib having a high brisant zone which upon activation 

shatters the gas generant wafers. Alternatively, a dual 
function squib (104) is used which can produce mechanical 

forces which force a breaking object (108) to impact on the 
gas generating wafers thereby shattering them and 

increasing the surface area of the gas generant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to gas generators for inflating 
vehicle inflatable restraint cushions, commonly known as air bags, 
so as to provide impact protection to occupants of the passenger 
vehicles. More particularly, this invention relates to an 
improvement in providing varying rates of inflation of the air bag 
dependent on crash conditions and/or occupant conditions. An air bag restraint system, referred to as a module, 
typically includes a canister which encloses a gas generator or as, 
it is commonly known, an inflator, and at least part of an air bag, 
and a cover which conceals the module from view. When the vehicle 
is involved in a collision, a crash signal initiates operation of 
the inflator to cause the air bag to deploy. The inflator produces 
an inert gas (e.g., nitrogen) which is directed under pressure into 
the air bag to force the air bag out of the canister incorporated 
into the module and into the passenger compartment of the vehicle. 
In a pyrotechnic type inflator, gas is produced by the burning of 
a gas generating material. As the air bag is forced out of the 
container, pressure exerted on the cover causes selected portions 
of the cover to separate in a predetermined manner along tear seams 
to enable the air bag to be directed into the passenger 
compartment. As the air bag is directed into the passenger 
compartment, it is inflated by the continued flow of gas produced 
by the inflator. With a pyrotechnic type inflator, the rate at which the gas  
 
generant must burn in order to provide gas at a sufficient rate to 
inflate the air bag, so as to protect the occupant, is dependent on 
a number of factors; i.e., the speed at which the vehicle is 
moving, the severity of the crash, the size and location of the 
occupant and the temperature of the inflator. For example, when a 
vehicle moving at a moderate rate of speed (30 miles per hour/50 
kph) with an inflator at a temperature of approximately 70°F (21°C) 
is involved in a collision, a "normal" rate of gas production from 
the inflator must be sufficient to deploy the air bag within the 
time required to protect the occupants. When a vehicle moving at 
a high rate of speed (50 mph/85 kph) impacts another vehicle moving 
at approximately the same speed, a higher rate of gas production 
from the inflator may be required to provide the same level of 
protection to the occupants. An additional concern is the capability to compensate for the 
reduced reaction rate of cold gas generant by increasing the gas 
production

A gas generator (50) for inflating a vehicle 
inflatable restraint cushion, the generator comprising: 


an elongated housing (56) including a tubular 
combustion chamber (58) having a pair of end portions (60, 

62); 
means (64, 66) for closing said end portions 
thereby defining at least one combustion chamber; 
a gas generating material formed into a plurality 
of gas generating wafers (80), arranged along the length of 

said tubular combustion chamber and spaced from each other 
in a side-by-side array; 
at least one igniter means (70, 72) in spaced 

relationship from said gas generating wafers for igniting 
said gas generating wafers; 
a squib or squibs (24, 68, 104, 105) in spaced 
relationship to said igniter means, which upon activation 

ignite said igniter means;
