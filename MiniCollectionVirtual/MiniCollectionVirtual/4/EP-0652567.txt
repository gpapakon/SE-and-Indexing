<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus provide fuse trimming of analog
integrated circuit parameters in plastic packages. The

apparatus includes an electrically interruptible circuit
element, such as a fuse; a level reading unit which reads the

state of the electrically interruptible circuit element and
generates a code in response to the state; a state altering

unit, such as a current source for providing a blow current;
and a control circuit. A test level reading device allows

screening for marginally-blown fuses. A switchable element
removes applied voltage from fuses when the fuse is not being

blown or read to prevent fuse regrowth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrical circuit 
including an electrically interruptible circuit element 
such as a non-volatile memory in integrated circuits which 
can be programmed before or after encapsulation in any type 
of package. We will describe a preferred use of on-chip 
circuitry for blowing fuses for precision trimming analog 
integrated circuits encapsulated in plastic package 
devices. It is well known in the art of integrated circuit 
design to use one or more fuses, in conjunction with other 
fuses and circuit elements, to set a circuit parameter such 
as a voltage, a current, or a voltage or current gain. 
Fuses generally have an intact, or uninterrupted, state and 
a blown, or interrupted state. In the intact state, the 
fuse is a low resistance element capable of conducting 
current. In the blown state, the fuse has a very high 
resistance and generally does not conduct current. When 
used in conjunction with other circuit elements to set a 
circuit parameter, the fuse may be configured so that its 
intact state corresponds to a first value of the circuit 
parameter, and its blown state corresponds to a second 
value of the circuit parameter. Fuse trimming circuits are commonly used in analog 
integrated circuit devices. Such analog integrated 
circuits may include digital signal processors, 
telecommunications devices, and operational amplifiers. in 
analog integrated circuits, it is often desirable to 
precisely trim circuit parameters to a predetermined range 
of values. While analog  
 
integrated circuits may be designed to produce such parameters 
within a certain range of values, variations in manufacturing 
processes may produce an unacceptably wide tolerance level for 
parameters after manufacturing. Accordingly, it is well known 
to use fuse trimming to improve the tolerance range of analog 
integrated circuit parameters for high performance 
applications. In prior art devices, fuses have been fabricated on the 
surface of an integrated circuit device directly adjacent to 
and in electrical connection with a large area of metal known 
as a probe pad. The fuse is fabricated from one of the 
conductor layers used in the integrated circuit device, such 
as a metal layer or a low-resistance polysilicon layer. As is 
well known in the art, the fuse is formed of a narrow strip of 
the conductor layer. When the current through the fuse exceeds 
a predetermined amount, the fuse "blows" by interrupting the 
strip of conductor layer. The final passivation layers of the 
integrate
