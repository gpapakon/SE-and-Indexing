<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal 
transfer image receptor sheet for use in heat-melting 
thermal transfer. More specifically, it relates to a 
thermal transfer image receptor sheet for use in thermal 
transfer, which has the property of receiving thermal 
transfer images, patterns, characters, etc. (to be simply 
referred to as image(s) hereinafter), and which gives an 
image transfer product excellent in adhesion to a transfer 
image, scratch resistance, abrasion resistance and 
weatherability. A heat-melting thermal transfer device is 
recently widely used in a facsimile machine, a word 
processor, a computer terminal printer, and the like since 
it has features in that it is noise-free because of its 
non-impact system, maintenance-free, less expensive and 
small in size. A thermal transfer material is generally 
produced by forming a heat-melting ink layer composed mainly 
of a wax on one surface of a substrate formed of a thin 
plastic film such as a polyester film (e.g., polyethylene 
terephthalate or polyethylene naphthalate). An image is 
transferred as follows. While the above heat-melting ink 
layer is in contact with the surface of an image receptor 
such as general paper, part of the heat-melting ink is 
transferred to the image receptor by heating the other 
surface of the substrate, for example, by means of a thermal 
head. With a recent progress in the automatization of 
factories and stores, thermal transfer materials are  
 
increasingly used in the fields of labels and barcodes, and 
image-recorded sheets (e.g., labels and barcodes) are 
increasingly required to have various resistances such as 
scratch resistance and abrasion resistance. For this 
purpose, there has been developed a thermal transfer 
material having a heat-melting ink layer (transfer layer) 
composed mainly of a resin, and various materials such as 
coat paper, synthetic paper and a plastic sheet have begun 
to be used as image receptors depending upon purposes. When 
the thermal transfer material having a heat-melting ink 
layer composed mainly of a resin is used, it is difficult to 
transfer the heat-melting ink to general paper. The above 
heat-melting ink layer can be transferred to synthetic paper 
or a plastic sheet, while the adhesion of the heat-melting 
ink layer to the synthetic paper or the plastic sheet is 
insufficient, and the heat-melting ink layer is easily 
peeled off when a Cellophane tape is attached and peeled. As an image receptor which serves to improve the 
resistances of an
