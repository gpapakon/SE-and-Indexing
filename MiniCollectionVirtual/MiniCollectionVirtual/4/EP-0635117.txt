<ABSTRACT>
In a fiber optic gyroscope (10) having a pair of light waves counter-propagating in a fiber optic loop (44), a phase modulator (28) driven with a variable frequency and amplitude modulation signal on a line (32) so as to null any rotation induced optical phase shift, and using the difference between the drive frequency and the loop eigenfrequency as a measure of rotation rate, is provided with a calibration circuit (34) which determines the actual loop eigenfrequency while in rotation. A modulation signal is applied having an amplitude that causes the closed loop output frequency to equal the loop eigenfrequency independent of rotation rate. The amplitude is fine tuned by applying a phase dither and adjusting the amplitude until effects of the dither are minimized.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical interferometers 
and more particularly to determining the 
optical propagation (transit time) delay incurred by a 
signal traveling in a fiber optic loop. It is known in the art (as e.g. from WO-A-91 19 167) that a specific type of 
optical interferometer known as a fiber optic gyro (FOG) 
uses the theory of relative motion to calculate the 
angular velocity or rotation rate of a body. A FOG 
typically consists of a light source, an optical loop, a 
beam splitter and combiner, a phase modulator, and an 
optical detector. Typically a light wave is injected 
into both ends of a single fiber optic cable shaped in a 
circle (called a ring or loop). The beam splitter 
serves to split the light wave from the light source 
into two substantially equal waves and sends them 
propagating in opposite directions around the optical 
loop. The beam combiner serves to combine the waves 
after they have traveled around the loop and the optical 
detector measures the intensity of the combined wave. 
The beam splitter and combiner is typically one 
component. One or more phase modulators, placed in one 
or both ends of the loop, may be used to induce a phase 
shift between the waves. When the optical ring is at rest, i.e., not 
subject to rotation, the two counter propagating light 
waves, combined by the beam combiner and monitored by 
the optical detector, will be exactly in phase because  
 
the distance traveled by 
both waves is exactly the same. When the waves are in 
phase, they combine for a maximum intensity at the optical 
detector. When the ring is rotated about an axis normal to 
the plane of the ring, the wave traveling in the direction 
of rotation will require more time to reach the end of the 
fiber (where the waves are combined), than the wave 
traveling in the opposite direction. This occurs because 
the detector is moving away from one wave and toward the 
other. Therefore, the length of travel is shorter for one 
wave than the other. This path difference causes a non-reciprocal 
(differential) phase shift between the two waves 
such that when the waves are combined, the optical 
intensity is not a maximum. The phase shift induced by the 
angular rotation rate of the ring is known as the "Sagnac" 
effect. For the purpose of closed loop operation, as is known 
in the art, such phase shift can be compensated for, i.e., 
nulled, by imposing a phase shift on the waves equal and 
opposite to the rotation induced (Sagnac) phase shift such 
that the phase difference between
