<ABSTRACT>
A flat screen having individually dipole-protected microdots and consisting of a field-emission cathode comprising microdots (12) individually protected by means of a series electrical coupling with a dipole (13) consisting of a depletion mode field effect transistor, said dipoles being designed to enable the protection threshold and the emission current level to be altered on all dots at once solely by changing the biasing of the substrate (14) common to said dipoles. Application in general to the field of display screens.

<CLAIMS>
A flat microtip screen, characterized in that each
microtip (12) is connected with a column conductor (3) through a

dipole (13) constituted of a depletion field effect transistor
having a drain connected with the microtip, a source connected to

the column conductor and an insulated gate directly connected to
said source or drain.
A flat microtip screen according to claim 1, characterized
in that it comprises a silicon layer (14) of a first conductivity

type and, in association with each microtip:

a first region (15) of a second conductivity type having a
high doping level formed in said layer (14) and connected with a

cathode conductor (3);
a second region (20) of the second conductivity type with a
low doping level formed in said layer (14), adjacent to the first

region (15) and coated with an insulating layer (16) provided
with an aperture;
a conductive layer (17) extending on said aperture and over
said insulating layer (16) between said aperture and said first

region; and
a microtip (12) formed above said conductive layer.
A flat microtip screen according to claim 2, characterized
in that the aperture, the microtip, the conductive layer,

the second and first regions of the second conductivity type are
concentric.
A flat microtip screen according to claim 2 or 3, characterized
in that said column conductors are made of regions

diffused in said silicon layer.
A flat microtip screen according to any of claims 2 to
4, characterized in that it further comprises means for modifying

the substrate biasing of said depletion field effect transistors.
