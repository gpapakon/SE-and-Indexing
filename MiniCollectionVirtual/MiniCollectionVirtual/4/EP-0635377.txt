<ABSTRACT>
One of a ribbon feed roller (32) and a 
pressure roller (34) for making an endless ink ribbon 

(30) run is displaceable relative to the other roller 
thereof for facilitation of replacement of the ink 

ribbon (30), and can be locked at a withdrawn position 
thereof. In a state where one roller is locked at the 

withdrawn position, mounting of the ink ribbon cassette 
on a printer is obstructed. Also, a running direction 

and an orientation of the endless ink ribbon (30) are defined 
so that damage to the bonded portion of the endless ink 

ribbon (30) is delayed as much as possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink ribbon
cassette for an impact printer such as a serial wire-dot
printer.In recent years, in contrast to the fact that more
compact ink ribbon cassettes are required because
impact printers are becoming more compact, there is a
demand for the service life of the ink ribbon to be
prolonged. To respond to this requirement, the ink
ribbon cassette disclosed in Japanese Unexamined
Utility Model Publication No. 62-128850 and in Japanese
Unexamined Utility Model Publication No. 63-51756 uses
an endless ink ribbon. In this type of ink ribbon
cassette, there is an ink ribbon storage unit, which
stores the ink ribbon in a zigzag manner, and an ink
ribbon passage which extends from a first side towards
a second side of the ink ribbon storage unit. Where
the ink ribbon is made to run from the first side of
the ink ribbon storage unit through the ink ribbon
passage to the second side thereof, a ribbon feed
roller is provided on the second side of the ink ribbon
storage unit. A pressure roller is elastically pressed
against the ribbon feed roller. The ribbon feed roller
is arranged in such a manner that the ink ribbon is
wound therearound over substantially a half
circumference thereof, with the pressure roller being
elastically pressed against the ink ribbon.When this ink ribbon cassette is mounted on the
carriage of a printer, a drive shaft projecting from
the carriage is received, and engages, in a hole in the
ribbon feed roller. During printing, the ribbon feed
roller is driven to rotate in a predetermined direction
by the drive shaft, whereby the ink ribbon is drawn
from one side of the ink ribbon storage unit through
the ink ribbon passage to the other side of the ink
ribbon storage unit where it is stored. With this
arrangement, the ink ribbon can be used over a long 
period of time until it reaches the end of its service
life, i.e. when it physically breaks.Moreover, to save natural resources, it is also
general practice to make it possible to replace the ink
ribbon in the ink ribbon cassette. In this case, the
ink ribbon cassette per se can be used semi-permanently.
An ink ribbon cassette with a replaceable
ink ribbon is constituted so that, when the ink ribbon
is to be replaced, the pressure roller is locked in a
withdrawn position at a distance from the ribbon feed
roller. This enables the replacement of the ink ribbon
to be easily carried out by the user.However, after replacing the ink ribbon, the user
is liable to make a mistake by mounting the ink ribbon
cassette
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An ink ribbon cassette, comprising:

ink ribbon storage means (10a) for storing an
endless ink ribbon (30);
ink ribbon passage means (10b, 10c) extending from
a first side of the ink ribbon storage means (10a) to a

second side thereof;
a ribbon feed roller (32) and a pressure roller
(34) provided at the second side of the ink ribbon

storage means (10a) for making an ink ribbon (30) run
from the first side of the ink ribbon storage means

(10a) to the second side thereof through the ink ribbon

passage means (10b, 10c), one of the ribbon feed roller
(32) and the pressure roller (34) being displaceable

between a pressing position in which said one roller is
elastically pressed against the other roller and a

withdrawn position in which said one roller is
retracted from the pressing position; and
locking means for releasably locking said one
roller in the withdrawn position,

   characterised in that the roller which is
displaceable is a drive roller and the other roller is

a driven roller.
An ink ribbon cassette as claimed in claim 1,
wherein, in the pressing position, the drive roller is

frictionally engaged with the driven roller so as to
transmit the rotational drive force of the drive roller

to the driven roller.
An ink ribbon cassette as claimed in claim l
or claim 2, wherein the drive roller and the driven

roller are each provided with gear elements which
engage when the drive roller is in the pressing

position and transmit the rotational drive force of the
drive roller to the driven roller.
An ink ribbon cassette as claimed in claim 1,
2 or 3, wherein the drive roller is rotatably supported 

by a movable support member (36; 48) which is provided
with at least one plate spring element (36c; 48a)

having a claw element (36d, 48b), the claw element
(36d, 48b) engaging a hole formed in a side wall of the

ink ribbon storage means (10c) when the drive roller is
in the withdrawn position to lock the drive roller in

the withdrawn position.
An ink ribbon cassette as claimed in claim 4,
wherein the or each plate spring element (36c) has an

extension portion (36e) which projects out of the side
wall of the ink ribbon storage means (10a) when the

claw element (36d) is engaged with the hole and
interferes with a structure of a printer if the ink

ribbon cassette is mounted on the printer.
An ink ribbon cassette as claimed in claim 3,
4 or 5, wherein the ribbon feed roller (32) is the

driven roller, and the pressure roller (34) is the
displaceable drive roller rotatably supported by the

movable support member (36).
An ink ribbon cassette as claimed in any
preceding claim, wherein the drive roller includes a

shaft element (34a) which has an engagement hole (34d)
formed therein for receiving the drive shaft (40) of a

printer, the arrangement being such that, if the ink
ribbon cassette is mounted on the printer while the

drive roller is in the withdrawn position, the drive
shaft (40) cannot be received in the engagement hole

(34d).
An ink ribbon cassette as claimed in any
preceding claim, wherein the ribbon feed roller (32)

and the pressure roller (34) each comprise a
cylindrical portion (32b, 34b) having a substantially

smooth surface.
An ink ribbon cassette as claimed in any
preceding claim in combination with an endless ink

ribbon (30) which is formed by superimposing and 
ultrasonically bonding end portions (52, 54) of a long

length of an ink ribbon made of a fabric of a synthetic
resin fibre such that one side part (52') of the bonded

portion of the endless ink ribbon is molten and
resinified as a solid part, and the other side part

(54') thereof is brought to a semi-molten state as a
semi-solid part,

   the running direction and the orientation of the
endless ink ribbon being defined so as to avoid a

passing mode where the resinified solid part of the
bonded portion passes the printing head of the printer

in a non-opposed direction when the ink ribbon cassette
is mounted on a printer.
