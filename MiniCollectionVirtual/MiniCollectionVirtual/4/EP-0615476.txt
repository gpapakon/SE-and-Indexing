<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the casting of light metal alloys for
example of aluminium or magnesium.Existing casting techniques for the production of light metal
alloy castings are unsatisfactory because of low production rates and
casting defects resulting from turbulence during pouring of the molten
metal. In order to avoid the filling problems when casting light alloys
the low pressure die casting process uses a liquid metal reservoir
which is pressurised to displace the metal up a riser tube into the
metal die. Although this process results in an improvement in the
casting quality it has two main disadvantages: firstly, poor control
of upwards displacement of the metal sometimes results in the
turbulence which the process is intended to avoid; secondly,
production rates are low because of the long cycle time (typically 4 -
6 minutes) of the metal die.In the Cosworth process as described for example in UK Patent
No. 2187984 sand moulds are filled by a low pressure technique and
improved control over filling is achieved by the use of an
electromagnetic pump having no moving parts which is effectively a
linear motor. The sand mould has a horizontal parting line to
facilitate bottom feeding. The moulds are made from chemically
bonded sand at a rate dependent upon the time taken by the chemical
reactions required to bind the sand. Although the cycle time is
considerably reduced compared to low pressure die casting a casting
may nevertheless take some 40 to 60 seconds to produce.Ferrous casting processes using sequentially produced green
sand moulds are known to have a shorter cycle time but have been
disregarded for the casting of light metal alloys because of the filling
problems described above. For example U.K. Patent No. 848604 by Disa
describes the commercially well-known ferrous metal casting apparatus
in which green sand mould halves are continually formed in a
compaction zone and arranged one behind the other to provide a
succession of moulds with vertical parting lines. The moulds are
moved under a top filling station from which molten ferrous metal is
gravity poured into the successive mould cavities. In a modification 
of the Disa process described in U.K. Patent No. 1357410 by Gravicast
Patentverwertungsgesellschaft m.b.H., the sand moulds are bottom filled but the velocity and
pressure of the in-flowing melt cannot be controlled to the extent required for casting of light
metal alloys.It is an object of the present invention to further improve the casting of light metal
alloys, in particular
