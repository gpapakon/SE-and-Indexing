<ABSTRACT>
A knock-in anchor (110) with an anchor bolt (112) with a truncatedly conically widening strutting head (122) on the forward end to be introduced into the corresponding securing drilling. On the anchor bolt (112) can slide an anchor sleeve (116) which has a plurality of anchor arms (136) formed by slitting over a part of its length. By striking the end of the anchor sleeve (116) outside the drilling, the anchor arms (136) are driven over the strutting head (122) and pivoted outwards, thus anchoring them in the securing drilling. The forward end regions (140) of the anchor arms (136) in the fitting direction, which are limited against the rest of the anchor sleeve (116) by a circumferential groove (138), together have the outer shape of two truncated cones (140a, 140b) bearing against each other's smaller-diameter faces.

An impact-installable wall anchor (10; 110) with an anchoring pin 
(12; 112), the elongated cylindrical shaft of which (14; 114) has a head (22; 122), 

which expands in the form of a truncated cone, at its front end in the direction of 
installation and on which an anchoring sleeve (16; 116), which is repeatedly slotted 

over a portion of its length from its front end in the direction of installation and forms 
a number of anchoring arms (36; 136) in the slotted region, is slipped on so that it can 

slide, the internal diameter of the anchoring sleeve (16; 116) corresponding essentially 
to the external diameter of the cylindrical shaft (14; 114) and a peripheral groove (38; 

138), which is mounted in the outside of the anchoring sleeve (16; 116) at some 
distance from the end that is the front end in the direction of installation and which 

forms the end regions of the anchoring arms, (36; 136) that are the front end regions in 
the direction of installation so that these end regions can swing out relative to the 

adjoining regions with deformation of the material remaining in the base of the groove 
in such a manner that, when inserted in the associated borehole (18; 118), they are 

driven by impacts on the end face of the anchoring sleeve (16; 116), which is directed 
away from the direction of installation, onto the expanding head (12, 122) supported 

on the base of the borehole and swung out in such a manner that their end, which is 
the front end in the installation direction, penetrates the material of the borehole wall 

with production of an undercut, characterized in that the front end regions (40; 140) of 
the anchoring arms (36; 136) in the direction of installation together have the external 

shape of two truncated cones (40a; 140a, 140b), the end surfaces of which of smaller 

diameter are adjacent and the base surface of which, formed on the one hand at the 
end, which is the front end in the installation direction, and, on the other at the groove 

(38; 138), each have, in the unexpanded state, a diameter, which essentially 
corresponds to the external diameter of the anchoring sleeve.  

 
The wall anchor of claim 1, characterized in that the truncated cone 
surface (40a), constructed adjacent to the front end surface in the direction of 

installation, has a smaller conical angle than the adjacent truncated cone surface (40b). 
The wall anchor of claim 1, characterized in that the truncated cone 
surface (140a), constructed adjacent to the front end surface in the direction of 

installation, has a larger conical angle than the adjacent truncated cone surface (140b). 
The wall anchor of claim 3, characterized in that the conical angle of 
the front, truncated cone surface (140a) in the direction of the installation is selected to 

be larger than 90°, so that the angle enclosed in a central longitudinal section between 
its front end surface in the direction of installation and the truncated cone surface 

defines a sharp-edged peripheral edge, which penetrates the wall of the borehole in 
chisel fashion during the installation process. 
The wall anchor of claim 4, characterized in that the angle enclosed 
between the front end surface in the direction of installation and the truncated cone 

surface (140a) ranges from 15° to 75°, preferably from 30° and 60°. 
The wall anchor of one of the claims 3 to 5, characterized in that the 
conical angle of the expanding head (122) is selected so that the anchoring arms (136), 

formed by slotting the anchoring sleeve (116) in the region of the front truncated 
surface in the direction of installation, are, in the specified expanded state in the region 

of their conical surface lines, in at least approximately radial position with respect to 
the longitudinal center axis of the borehole (118).  

 
The wall anchor of claims 1 or 6, characterized in that the width of 
the opening of the groove (38; 138), measured in the direction of installation, is 

selected so that the opening is essentially closed when the front anchoring arm regions 
(40; 140) are expanded to the specified extent. 
The wall anchor of claim 7, characterized in that the peripheral 
groove (38; 138) has a rectangular cross section. 
The wall anchor of claim 7, characterized in that the peripheral 
groove (38; 138) has an essentially triangular cross section with the apex of the 

triangle lying at the base of the groove. 
The wall anchor of one of the claims 2 to 9, characterized in that 
the conical angle of the front truncated cone surface (40a; 140a) in the direction of 

installation corresponds approximately to the conical angle of the expanding head (22; 
122) of the anchoring pin. 
The wall anchor of one of the claims 1 to 10, characterized in that 
the free surface (24; 124) of the expanding head (22; 122) pointing in the direction of 

installation has the shape of a cone, the conical angle of which essentially is equal to 
the angle of the cutting edges at the front end of the rock drill used to produce the 

borehole.
