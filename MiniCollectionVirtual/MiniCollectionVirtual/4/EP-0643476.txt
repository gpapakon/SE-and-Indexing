<ABSTRACT>
In a direct conversion receiver in which received radio frequency signals are 
mixed with quadrature local oscillator signals in I and Q channels, the output signals from 

the mixers are applied to a phase detector by way of respective frequency tracking filters 
to reduce the noise bandwidth and improve the sensitivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to direct conversion, or homodyne, receivers. Such 
receivers are commonly used in radio pagers. In European Patent Application EP-A-O 153 835 there is disclosed a direct conversion 
receiver for a radio pager in which received radio frequency signals are mixed with local 
oscillator signals in quadrature-phase arms the outputs of which are applied to a detector for 
recovering data signals represented by the received signals. According to the present invention, a direct conversion radio receiver arrangement in 
which received radio frequency signals are mixed with local oscillator signals in quadrature-phase 
arms and output signals from these quadrature-phase arms are applied to a phase detector 
of the receiver arrangement is characterised in that each of said quadrature-phase arms includes 
a frequency tracking filter. The frequency tracking filters may comprise, for example, injection locked oscillators, 
phase locked loops or phase locked filter loops. A direct conversion receiver in accordance with the present invention will now be 
described with reference to the accompanying drawing, of which: 
Figure 1 shows schematically a known form of receiver, Figure 2 shows schematically a receiver in accordance with the invention, Figure 3 shows a part of the receiver of Figure 2 in more detail, and Figure 4 shows schematically a variation of part of the receiver shown in Figure 2. Referring first to Figure 1, in the known form of direct conversion receiver, received 
FSK radio frequency signals are applied to mixers 1 and 2 respectively in I and Q channels or 
arms, to which mixer signals from a local oscillator 3 are applied in phase quadrature. Output 
signals from the mixers 1 and 2 are applied to a phase detector 4 by way of respective low pass 
mixers 5 and 6 and limiters 7 and 8.  
 Referring to Figure 2, in accordance with the present invention, the output signals 
from the limiters 7 and 8 are applied to the phase detector 4 by way of respective 
frequency tracking filters 9 and 10, which may take the form of injection locked 
oscillators, phase locked loops or phase locked filter loops. These frequency tracking 
filters are arranged to track the difference frequencies generated in the I and Q arms, 
effectively reducing the noise bandwidth to that required to pass the difference frequency. 
This improves the signal to noise ratio ahead of the detector 4 and hence improves the 
sensitivity, by a factor approximating to the square root of the modulation index.
