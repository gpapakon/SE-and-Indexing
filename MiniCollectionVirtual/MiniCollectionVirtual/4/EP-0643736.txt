<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for preparing thermally stable, electrically 
conductive substituted and unsubstituted doped conjugated polymer 
compositions which are cation complexes having a relatively high electrical 
conductivity and preferably having relatively high thermal stability. The 
compositions comprising such conjugated polymers can be combined with 
other materials as for example fillers and polymers. Polymer articles, including 
films, inks, fibers, and coatings can be formed from the polymer compositions 
of this invention. There has recently been an increased interest in the electrochemistry and 
electrical phenomena of polymeric systems. Recently, work has intensified 
with polymers having extended conjugation in at least one backbone chain. 
One conjugated polymer system with strong hydrogen bonding and polar 
interactions currently under study is polyaniline. See for example EP-A-0017717 
and US-A-3963498, -4025463, -4855361, -4798685, -4806271, 
-4851487, -4940640, -4798685, -5006278 and -5069820; and 
WO89/01694 and WO90/102797. Another conjugated polymer system which 
is capable of strong hydrogen bonding and/or polar interactions is polypyrrole, 
see for example EP-A-055358. The present invention provides a method for preparing an electrically 
conductive substituted or unsubstituted conjugated homopolymer or 
copolymer cation complex by contacting substituted or unsubstituted 
positively charged conjugated homopolymer or copolymer cations with 
negatively charged dopant anions. According to the invention, said dopant 
anions have at least one anionic functionality and at least one hydrogen 
bonding group. According to a preferred embodiment, the anionic functionality and the 
hydrogen bonding group are located in the dopant molecule such that they 
cannot bond to one another.  
 One aspect of the present invention relates to the preparation of an 
electrically conductive, doped, substituted or 
unsubstituted conjugated polymer comprised of an 
ionized conjugated polymer (polymeric cation) having 
one or more "hydrogen bonding groups" and one or more 
dopant solutes (anions) selected from the group 
consisting of organic species having at least one 
anionic group as for example a phosphonate or sulfonate 
acid functional group, and having one or more "hydrogen 
bonding groups", said hydrogen bonding groups of said 
dopant solute being capable of bonding with said 
hydrogen bonding groups of the conjugated polymer. 
Another aspect of this invention is articles formed 
from
