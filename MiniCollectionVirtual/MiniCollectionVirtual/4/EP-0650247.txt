<ABSTRACT>
An iron core of a multi-phase linear motor 
which is not restricted by the shape of the motor is 

manufactured. A stator 1 and a mover 2 are disposed 
opposite to each other through air gap. In 

manufacturing of the iron core of the multi-phase linear 
motor having a multiplicity of teeth 16 formed on 

surfaces of a plurality of salient poles P1, P2, ... 
disposed in the stator 1 or the motor 2, the stator iron 

core 10 or mover iron cores 22a and 22b are formed by 
punching iron plates 30a, 30b, ... forming the iron core 

by a punching mold 31 while selectively controlling to 
push out and withdraw movable punches 33 included in the 

punching mold 31 and disposed to be able to be pushed 
out and withdrawn in each of the salient poles so that 

the tips of the salient poles P1, P2, ... form tooth 
tops 16a or tooth bottoms 16b of the teeth 16 at a 

predetermined period for each punching of the iron 
plates and by laminating the punched iron plates 

successively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing an iron core of a multi-phase linear motor 
including a hybrid type linear motor, a VR (variable 
reluctance) type linear motor and a permanent magnet 
type linear motor. Fig. 9 is a longitudinal sectional view 
illustrating a cylindrical linear motor relating to the 
present invention. In Fig. 9, each of stator iron cores 101, 102, 
103 and 104 of a stator 100 of the cylindrical linear 
motor include an outer peripheral portion formed into a 
stepped ring which is thick in the thickness direction 
thereof and an inner peripheral portion on which a 
plurality of stator teeth 105 are disposed at an equal 
pitch in the shaft direction. The stator iron cores 
101, 102, 103 and 104 are supported by a frame 116 and 
housed therein. The stator iron cores 101 and 102 are combined 
so that the outer peripheral portions thereof abut  
 
against each other to form a ring groove in which a ring 
winding 106 is disposed to be held between the stator 
iron cores 101 and 102. Similarly, a ring winding 107 
is disposed in a ring groove formed between the stator 
iron cores 103 and 104 to be held between the stator 
iron cores 103 and 104. In the cylindrical linear motor, the stator 
iron plates 101 and 102 and the ring winding 106 
constitute one phase and the stator iron plates 103 and 
104 and the ring winding 107 constitute another phase to 
thereby constitute two phases as a whole. A ring permanent magnet 108 is held between 
the stator iron cores 101, 102 and 103, 104 constituting 
the two phases and is magnetized in the shaft direction 
of a mover 109. A mover iron core 110 of the mover 109 is 
cylindrical and a plurality of mover teeth 111 are 
disposed on an outer peripheral surface of the mover 
iron core 110 at an equal pitch in the shaft direction. 
The mover 109 is supported movably in the shaft 
direction through bearings 114 and 115 by brackets 112 
and 113. The stator teeth 105 and the mover teeth 111 
have the following positional relation. That is, when 
the stator teeth 105 disposed on the stator iron core  
 
104 are just opposite to the mover teeth 111, the stator 
teeth 105 disposed on the stator iron core 103 are 
shifted by 2/4 of the tooth pitch in the shaft direction 
as compared with the stator iron core 104. Further, the 
stator teeth 105 disposed on the stator iron core 102 
are shifted by 1/4 of the tooth pitch in the shaft 
direction as compared with the stator iron core 104. 
The stator teeth 105 disposed on the stator iron core
