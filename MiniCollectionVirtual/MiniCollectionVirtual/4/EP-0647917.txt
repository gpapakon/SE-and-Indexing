<ABSTRACT>
A bar-code reading apparatus and method in which a bar code 
including a main-part bar code and an add-on bar code is 

read, a start guard bar (SB) and end guard bar (EB) of the 
main-part bar code are detected, and the bar code is 

decoded into characters, the apparatus/method comprising 
means for/steps of detecting a right end of the main-part 

bar code based on the start guard bar (SB) and end guard 
bar (EB), identifying an add-on bar code by detecting a bar 

code occurring a predetermined interval after the right 
end, and decoding the add-on bar code.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bar-code reading 
apparatus and method, particularly for reading so-called 
"add-on" bar codes. A bar-code reader, which reads product codes of 
alphanumeric characters represented by series of adjacent 
stripes of various widths, is widely used as a terminal of 
a point of sale (POS) system, for example. To facilitate 
the management of sales by increasing the amount of product 
information recorded on a bar code, a bar-code system which 
has a normal bar code (below, a main-part bar code) followed 
by an additional bar code (below, an add-on bar code), 
is recently being put into practical use. Accordingly, a bar-code reader which can read an add-on 
bar code properly and efficiently is in great demand. A bar-code reader usually reads a bar code by scanning 
a laser beam over the bar code, measuring the widths of the 
black and white bars based on the light reflected and converting 
the bar widths into alphanumeric characters. 
Conventional bar-code readers are designed mostly for main-part 
bar codes, with little consideration of add-on bar 
codes. It appears that there is no established method of 
reading an add-on bar code fully automatically and 
economically. Fig. 1(a) shows a configuration of a bar code having 
a 2-character add-on bar code. Fig. 2(a) is an odd-even 
parity configuration table for a 2-character add-on bar 
code. As shown in Fig. 1(a), a bar code having an add-on bar 
code is composed of a main part and an add-on part. The 
format of the main part is stipulated by such code system 
standards as UPC/A, UPC/E, EAN/13 and EAN/8. The 
2-character add-on part includes a special left guard bar 
(SLGB), a first character labelled here as X, a delineate 
bar (DB) and a second character Y. X and Y are arbitrary 
alphanumeric characters, each carrying odd-even parity.  
 
The parity for the characters X and Y is determined, as 
shown in Fig. 2(a), by using the residual of a 2-digit 
decimal number XY divided by 4, where X and Y are the tens 
and unit digits, respectively. Fig. 1(b) shows a configuration of a bar code having 
a 5-character add-on bar code. Fig. 2(b) is an odd-even 
parity configuration table for this add-on bar code. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the 5-character add-on part 
includes a SLGB and a character followed by 4 pairs of a DB 
and a character, the characters being labelled V, W, X, Y 
and Z. The parity for the five characters is determined, 
as shown in Fig. 2(b), by using the unit digit α obtained 
from the following calculation:-

   block identification means for identifying 
any of the blocks of the main-part bar code, based on the 

start guard bar, centre guard bar and end guard bar; and 
   right-block determination means for checking 

whether all the characters in the block concerned carry 
even parity and determining the right block in dependence 

upon the checking. 
Bar-code reading apparatus as claimed in claim 3,

code-system determination means for determining a code 
system used, and wherein said right-block determination 

means regards the block concerned as being the right block
