<ABSTRACT>
A method for processing a digital frequency-division multiplex signal of channel signals sampled at a sampling frequency fA, with filtering, frequency conversion, interpolation and digital addition, characterised in that, before the frequency conversion, complex filtering is carried out with a reduction in sampling rate from fA to f'A, in that after that, a first frequency shift is carried out by means of a first complex mixer in such a manner that the useful band centre frequency fm of the digital channel signal falls into the range -f'A/4 
<
/= fm 
<
/= + f'A/4, in that after that, a first post filtering is carried out and in that before or after the individual frequency conversion of the channel signal, a second post filtering is carried out where the sampling rate is increased to the original sampling rate fA (Figure 2 and 4). Used in broadcast and television distribution systems. Reduced circuit complexity and possibility for implementation as VLSI (here also better separation into subfunction units).
