<ABSTRACT>
A method for the collection and regranulation of waste containing drawn plastics comprises a series of steps whereby said waste: a) is processed in a first reduction stage employing a cutting device to give a particle mixture of reduced volume, and then, b) said mixture is subjected continuously to selective heating up to the relaxation temperature of a drawn plastics portion of the particle mixture by means of a heating line connected to or prior to the reduction stage; c) the resulting product and a fraction of shrunken, embrittled plastic particles of one kind, and at least a further fraction of unshrunken particles of one or more other kinds of plastic undergo, d) continuous separation or sorting in a suitable separating or sorting device applying a separating or sorting process, to give the fractions mentioned in c).

Method for detecting and refining waste materials (20 to 23) 
containing expanded plastics materials, wherein these waste materials in 

a series of working steps: 

a) are processed into a particle mixture (25) reduced in volume in a 
first comminution stage with use of a cutting mechanism (4) such as a 

twin-shaft cutting mechanism and this 
b) in the course of passage through a heating path (6) following the 
comminution stage or connected upstream thereof is subjected to a 

selectively acting heating up to attainment of the relaxation 
temperature of a component of expanded plastics materials contained in 

the particle mixture and these desired plastics material components in 
that case are shrunk and embrittled under a further reduction in 

volume, whereupon 
c) the plastics material particles of one kind thus obtained and shrunk 
and embrittled to a fraction and at least one further fraction of 

unshrunk particles of one or more other plastics material kinds as 
well as particle mixtures (26) containing a residual fraction of 

foreign materials such as paper etc., are subjected to a subsequent 
comminution and the comminuted stock (27) 
d) is subjected to a separation or sorting into the fractions stated 
under c) by use of a separating or classifying process in the course 

of passage through a suitable separating or classifying device (35), 
 
characterised thereby that the steps a) and b) are undertaken on the spot 

at the respective places of accrual or detection (2) of the waste 
materials (20 to 23), wherein the accruing and detected preliminary 

refined particle mixture (26) is collected and combined into batches 
suitable for transport and then transported in batches to a central 

collation and refining plant (30), and that the delivered batches are 
stored in the central collation and refining plant before further 

processing and in that case are mixed and that finally the working steps 
c) and d) are carried out in the central refining plant (30).  

 
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby that synthetic 
material components which are difficult to comminute, such as fibres, 

foils, foam plastics, beaker and/or shell packagings, are thermally 
treated before the first working step a) and thus are softened or shrunk 

according to case. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby that plastics 
waste materials (20 to 23) with composite materials, composite components 

or mixtures thereof are initially heated as feed stock in the fluidised

sorted in a continuation sieve flow bed, which is matched in its sieve 
mesh width to the upper limit size of the shrunk particles, from the 

unshrunk materials and separately discharged, wherein several heating and 
sieving fluidised beds can be so connected one after the other for the 

purpose of sorting several expanded thermoplastics that the 
thermoplastics shrink at temperatures corresponding to their type by a 

stepwise temperature increase of the feed stock.

preliminarily comminuted particle mixture is subjected to a selectively
