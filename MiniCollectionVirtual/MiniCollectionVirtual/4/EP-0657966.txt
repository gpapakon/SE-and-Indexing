<ABSTRACT>
An electrical pin field has a printed 
circuit board (12) having a plurality of pins (10) 

inserted therethrough, having contact sections (18,20) 
positioned on opposite sides of the board (12). An 

insulating housing (30) is positioned on one side (32) of 
the printed circuit board (12), whereas a housing (40) is 

positioned on the opposite side (46), being held in place 
by way of a locking plate (42). The locking plate (42) 

includes two opposing locking arms (54), which when the 
locking plate (42), and housing (40) are fully positioned 

on the printed circuit board (12) grip the pin terminal 
portions (21) adjacent to the board (12), thereby 

retaining the housing to the board (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical pin field inserted
in a printed circuit board with back-to-back headers
positioned on opposite sides of the printed circuit board.It is well known to form a pin field in printed
circuit boards. These pins would be electrically
connected to circuit traces in a printed circuit board, by
way of press fit, for example, by way of compliant
pin portions within the printed circuit board through
hole. Extending in opposite directions from the compliant
pins, are pin portions profiled for mating with
complementary terminals in a complementary connector.
Housings are positioned over the pins on opposite sides of
the printed circuit boards to form a completed connector
assembly. A difficulty which has arisen, is the method of
retaining the housings to the pin field.The printed circuit boards of the subject pin fields
may have through holes having a diameter as small as 0.55
mm. Thus, the pin has on one side of the
compliant pin portion, an enlarged barb, which is larger
than the nominal width of the pin, which is profiled for
interference fit within the corresponding housing.
However, as the pin must be inserted through the printed
circuit board through hole, the side of the pin opposite
the entry side of the printed circuit board cannot contain
a retaining barb, as it would not fit through the printed
circuit board. Therefore, on one side of the printed
circuit board, the pin is of a constant width, sometimes
as narrow as 0.50 mm. The housings which enclose these
pins generally have passageways which are interference fit
with the pins.One of the drawbacks to this approach is that, as the
housings are inserted over the pin field, the housings
interfere with the pin field and leave some of the 
plastic on the pins themselves which could lead to an
unstable contact, as the plastic is directly on the
contact surfaces. Thus, as the mating contact receptacle
could have plastic particles between the contact surfaces
and the pin itself, an ineffective contact could be made.
Secondly, as many housings are made from glass filled
housings, the glass particles in the housing could
actually skive through the gold plating on the contacts,
again leading to an ineffective contact system.Our prior application EP-A-0 578 487, which is
relevant under Art. 54(3) EPC, describes an electrical
pin field which alleviates the drawbacks discussed above.
It describes an electrical pin field comprising a printed
circuit board having a plurality of pins extending
between both sides thereof to

<CLAIMS>
An electrical pin field comprising a printed
circuit board (12) having a plurality of pins (10)

extending between both sides thereof to position pin
contact portions (20) on one side (46) of the board, a

housing (140) mounted on the one side of the board, and
a locking plate (142) positioned against the housing

(140), the locking plate (142) having a plurality of
through holes for receiving the pins (10) and at least

one movable gripping arm (154) extending towards the
housing (140) adjacent to each through hole and being an

interference fit with a passageway (166) in the housing
(140) and positioned against the pin (10), the

passageways in the housing being positioned between the
locking plate and the board.
The electrical pin field of claim 1, wherein a
second housing (30) is positioned on the other side of the

board (12).
The electrical pin field of claim 1 or 2, wherein

each gripping arm has an arcuate surface (62) along its
length facing the pin (10).
The electrical pin field of claim 1, 2 or 3,
wherein the passageways (166) include camming surfaces

for urging the gripping arms (154) into contact with the
pins.
The electrical pin field of any one of the
preceding claims, wherein the locking plate (142) is

latchable to the housing (140) in a preassembled
position, whereby the housing and the locking plate are

joined together prior to engagement with the pins. 
The electrical pin field of claim 5, wherein the
locking plate (142) includes latches (160) and the

housing (140) includes corresponding shoulders (169), the
latches being latchable to the shoulders to retain the

locking plate with the housing.
The electrical pin field of any one of the
preceding claims, wherein the locking plate and the housing include camming

surfaces of self-locking geometry, whereby the camming
surfaces are adapted to tighten the gripping arm (154) upon

a pin upon exertion of force upon the housing that would
tend to separate the housing from the board.
The electrical pin field of any one of the
preceding claims, wherein the gripping arms (154) include

lead sections that interfere with the housing to
laterally displace the arms into engagement with the

pins.
