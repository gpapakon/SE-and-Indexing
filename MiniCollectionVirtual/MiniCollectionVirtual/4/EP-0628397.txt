Device for the manufacture of corrugated pipes made of 
thermoplastic synthetic material, 


with, extending from an extrusion head, a moulding 
section (5) comprising a guide arranged in a frame (2), 

on which guide mould halves (6, 7) closed in pairs in an 
inlet (A) to form annular moulds, are advanced in a 

tightly packed sequence as a migratory mould by at least 
one drive pinion (18 - 21) arranged at the starting zone 

of the moulding section and meshing with racks on the 
packed mould halves, 
with, following the moulding section, a runout zone (B) 
in which the mould halves are separated from each other 

and engaged by gripper arms (12, 13), these being 
provided with coupling devices (14, 15), which return 

said mould halves into the inlet end, said gripper arms 
being actuator-operated and mounted on carriages (10, 11) 

which are driven back and forth on guides (8, 9) of 
return tracks arranged parallel to the moulding section, 

and 
with devices to control the motions of the gripper arms 
and the carriages,
characterised in that
the gripper arms located in guides on the carriage are 
exclusively traversible in a direction transverse to the 

direction of travel of said carriage.
