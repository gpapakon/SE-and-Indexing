<DESCRIPTION>
Chlor-alkali electrolysis is certainly the electrolytic
process of greatest industrial interest. In general terms,
said electrolysis process may be illustrated as the splitting
of a starting reactant, which is an aqueous solution of sodium
chloride (hereinafter defined as brine), to form gaseous
chlorine, sodium hydroxide in an aqueous solution and
hydrogen. This splitting is made possible by the application
of electrical energy which may be seen as a further reactant.
Chlor-alkali electrolysis is carried out resorting to three
technologies: with mercury cathodes cells, with porous
diaphragms cells or with ion exchange membranes cells. This
latter represents the most modern development and is
characterized by low energy consumptions and by the absence of
environmental or health drawbacks. Of the others, the mercury
cathodes cells are probably destined for a sharp decline in
use because of the severe restrictions adopted by most
countries as regards the release of mercury to the atmosphere
and soil. In fact, the most modern cell designs allow one to
meet the severe requirements of the present regulations, but 
the public opinion rejects "a priori" any process which could
lead to the possible release of heavy metals in the
environment.The diaphragm process has also problems as the main
component of the diaphragm is asbestos fibers, which is
recognized to be a mutagenic agent. The most advanced
technology foresees a diaphragm made by depositing a layer of
asbestos fibers mixed with certain polymeric binders onto
cathodes made of iron meshes. The structure thus obtained is
then heated whereby the fusion of the polymeric particles
permits the mechanical stabilization of the agglomerate of
asbestos fibers. As a consequence, the release of fibers
during operation (particularly in the drain liquids of the
plant) is minimized, as well as the release to the atmosphere
due to various expedients adopted during manipulation of the
asbestos in the deposition step.However, this appears to be only sufficient to prolong the
life of the diaphragm technology, in view of the ever
increasing difficulty in the supply of asbestos fibers due to
the progressive closing of the mines. For this reason, porous
diaphragms have been developed where the asbestos fibers are
substituted by fibers of inorganic materials considered to be
completely safe, such as zirconium oxide, mechanically
stabilized by polymeric binders. The deposition and the 
stabilization by heating in oven are carried out following the
same procedure adopted for
