<ABSTRACT>
This invention is directed to a flame retarded 
thermoplastic molding composition consisting 

essentially of a thermoplastic resin and a flame 
retardant. The thermoplastic resin is a copolyetherimide 

ester or a copolyether ester or a blend 
thereof. The flame retardant is magnesium carbonate 

or a blend of magnesium carbonate and calcium 
carbonate having in combination therewith zinc 

borate or zinc oxide or a blend of zinc borate and 
zinc oxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a non-brominated
flame retardant thermoplastic composition and more
particularly to the use of certain magnesium
compounds in combination with another component as
flame retardants for copolyetherimide esters and
copolyether esters. The magnesium compound is
magnesium carbonate or blends thereof with calcium
carbonate and the other component is zinc borate
or zinc oxide or mixture thereof.Copolyetherimide esters and copolyether esters
are well known in art and have been referred to as
elastomers. However, in certain applications, it
is necessary that such esters be rendered flame
retardant where fire can result from the burning of
the thermoplastic resin and which can then further
contribute to the burning of other combustibles in
the immediate area. While halogens, particularly
bromine containing compounds, have found usefulness
in thermoplastic resins as flame retardant additives,
there is, however, the need to move away
from such halogen compounds and into non-halogen
flame retardants because of the impact halogens
have on the environment. However, obtaining
successful non-halogen flame retardants with
copolyetherimide esters or copolyether esters is 
not obvious because of the complex nature of the
thermoplastic resins of this invention.Japanese patent publication JP62161850 discloses
a vinyl chloride graft polymer such as ethylene
vinyl acetate flame retarded with calcium carbonate
and magnesium hydroxide with clay and silica.European patent disclosure EP230564 discloses a
flame retarded rubber flooring composition, containing
in combination aluminum hydroxide and
either calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide or
magnesium oxide in combination with zinc borate,
antimony trioxide or antimony pentoxide.It has now been discovered that flame retarded
polymers of the type disclosed above, namely copolyetherimide
esters and copolyether esters, can
be obtained employing a particular non-halogen
flame retardant. It is surprising that certain
hydrated minerals provide a flame retardant composition
of this invention that can be molded into a
finished article. Other mineral flame retardants
have been tried but the resulting composition
cannot be injection molded. The mineral flame
retardants of this invention have a higher decomposition
temperature than other non-mineral flame
retardants. However, it has been surprisingly
discovered that only certain hydrated minerals are
capable of producing the flame retarded moldable
thermoplastic compositions of this invention.According to
