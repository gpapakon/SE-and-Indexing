<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum tube for handling an r.f. signal having a predetermined 
frequency 

range comprises a linear electron beam emitting cathode (136), a heater 
(166) and a non-electron 

emissive current modulating grid (138). The grid (138) is positioned 
from the cathode (136) by the 

distance an emitted electron from the cathode (136) can travel in a 
quarter cycle of the r.f. 

signal. Outer (202) and inner (204) coaxial metal tubes forming a 
resonant line of a signal 

coupler (143) are respectively connected to the grid (138) and cathode 
(136) so electrons passing 

through the grid (138) are in bundles in an interaction region (20) 
between an accelerating 

anode (18) and the grid (138). Ferrite tiles (42) absorb r.f. fields in 
the interaction region (20). In one 

embodiment a signal coupling loop (12) is between metal tubes (202,204) 
at an end of the tubes 

spaced 3λ/4 from the grid (138) and cathode (136). In a second 
embodiment the coupler (143) 

includes a low voltage coaxial line (110) having an inner conductor (112) 
connected to a first 

metal face (125), spaced from a second opposed metal (134) face by a 
solid dielectric (140). The 

coaxial outer conductor (114) is connected to a third metal face (128), 
spaced from a fourth 

opposed metal face (142) by the solid dielectric (140). The third (128) 
and fourth (142) faces surround the 

first (125) and second (134) faces. The first (115) and third (128) 

faces are at DC ground potential while the 
second (134) and fourth (142) faces are at high negative DC 

voltages. The second (134) and fourth (142) 
faces are respectively at common ends of interior (204) and exterior 

(202) coaxial metal tubes 
forming a λ/2 coupler (143). Other ends of the tubes (202,204) 

are connected to the cathode (136) and 
grid (138). Bias leads (190,194) for the grid (138) and cathode (136) 

are connected to the exterior (202) and interior (204) 
tubes at positions λ/4 from the grid (138) and cathode (136), 

while a heater lead (196) goes through the 
interior tube (204) at a position λ/4 from the grid (138) and 

cathode (136).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to high frequency vacuum
tubes including a cathode closely spaced to a non-emissive grid coupled
via a resonant structure to an r.f. signal to be amplified and more
particularly to such a tube with at least one of (1) an r.f. field
absorbing material substantially surrounding an interaction region
between the grid and an accelerating anode, (2) a loop between a pair
of coaxial resonant tubes coupling the signal to the grid and cathode,
(3) capacitive coupling to a pair of coaxial resonant tubes coupling
the signal to the grid and cathode, or (4) bias leads for the grid and
cathode respectively connected to outer and inner resonant coaxial
metal r.f. coupling tubes at a point n1λ/4 from the grid and cathode, in
combination with a heater lead extending through the inner tube at a
point n1λ/4 from the grid and cathode, where n1 is an odd integer and λ
is the wavelength of the r.f. signal supplied to the grid and cathode
by the inner and outer tubes.A recently developed vacuum tube for handling r.f. signals
includes a cathode for emitting a linear electron beam, a grid
positioned parallel and in close proximity to the cathode (no farther
than the distance an emitted electron can reach in a quarter cycle of a
signal being handled by the tube) for current modulating the beam, and
a cavity resonant to the frequency of the signal positioned between the
grid and a collector electrode for the beam. The grid is coupled by a
structure resonant to the frequency being handled by the tube to an
input of the tube. Very high efficiency is achieved with such a tube
by biasing the grid so current flowing from the cathode toward the grid
occurs for no more than one half cycle of the r.f. signal handled by
the tube. The grid is formed of a non-electron emissive material, such
as pyrolytic graphite or molybdenum.In one prior art configuration, a resonant input circuit
supplies electric fields in opposing phase between the cathode and grid
and between the grid and an accelerating anode positioned between the
grid and an output cavity. In another prior art device, a second 
resonant cavity positioned between the output cavity and the
accelerating anode is adjusted so the resonant frequency thereof is
above the frequency being handled by the tube, to increase the average
efficiency of the tube. These prior art structures are disclosed in
the commonly assigned US-A-4,480,210, 4,527,091 and 4,611,149. Commonly
assigned patent applications generally dealing with similar tubes are
