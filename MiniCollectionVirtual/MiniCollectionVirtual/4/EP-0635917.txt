<ABSTRACT>
In an optical modulator provided with a laser light 
source emitting a laser light, that is to be modulated by an 

optical modulator, the laser light source is made a 
wavelength variable laser that emits a laser light the 

wavelength of which is variable, and there are provided 
modulation signal means for applying a modulation signal to 

the optical modulator, signal producing means for producing 
and outputting a signal in response to the change of the 

voltage of the modulation signal, driving current generating 
means for generating a driving current to be applied to the 

laser light source. By the output signal of the signal 
producing means, a wavelength chirping reverse to the 

wavelength chirping occurring in the optical modulator is 
given to the laser light that is emitted from the laser 

light source caused by that the driving current for the 
laser light source varies in response to the change in the 

modulation signal, whereby the wavelength chirping occurring 
in the optical modulator is canceled, and the wavelength 

chirping of the modulation signal light that is emitted from 
the optical modulator is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical modulator according to the preamble of claim 1 
provided with a laser light source and, more particularly, 
to an optical modulator that performs a high speed long 
distance transmission. Figure 21 is a diagram showing a construction of a 
prior art optical modulator provided with a distributed 
feedback laser (hereinafter referred to as DFB laser) having 
a light absorbing layer of multi-quantum well structure. A modulator of that type is e.g. disclosed in JP-A-03 057 286. 
In the figure, reference numeral 1 designates a DFB laser 
having a resonator length of 300 ∼ 600 µm, a width of 300 
µm, and a thickness of 100 µm. Reference numeral 2 
designates an optical modulator provided with the DFB laser 
1, having a length of 100 ∼ 300 µm, a width of 300 pm, and a 
thickness of 100 µm. In the DFB laser 1, a positive side electrode 3 is 
provided as an electrode of the laser diode 1. An electrode 
4 is provided as a common grounding electrode for the DFB 
laser 1 and the optical modulator 2. An active layer 6 is 
provided as active layer of the DFB laser 1. In the optical modulator 2, a light absorbing layer 7 
comprises a multi-quantum well structure including twelve  
 
quantum well layers 4 ∼ 5 nm thick, putting between barrier 
layers 8 ∼ 10 nm thick, and its total thickness is 140 nm. 
An optical modulator negative side electrode 8 is an 
electrode for inputting a modulation signal to the optical 
modulator 2. A signal voltage source 9 supplies a 
modulation signal to the optical modulator negative side 
electrode 8. Reference numeral 10 designates a modulated 
signal light that is obtained by modulating the output light 
from the DFB laser 1 by the modulation signal that is output 
from the signal voltage source 9. Figures 22(a) to 22(d) are diagrams for explaining the 
operation of the optical modulator 2, where figure 22(a) 
shows the change in the modulation signal voltage which is 
applied to the optical modulator 2. Figure 22(b) shows the 
change in the modulated signal light output, occurring when 
the modulation signal is applied, and figure 22(c) shows the 
change in the refractive index of the light absorbing layer 
7 of the optical modulator 2, also occurring then. Figure 
22(d) shows the wavelength chirping (frequency variation) 
occurring in the optical modulator 2. A description is given of the operation of the optical 
modulator. First of all, when a D.C. current is flown in the DFB 
laser 1 as a light source from the LD positive side
