<ABSTRACT>
This invention is an all-acrylic or styrene-acrylic emulsion polymer for 
use in ceramic tile adhesives that has improved water resistance obtained by the 

addition to the polymer of 1-3 parts per hundred parts of monomer of one or more 
2-acetoacetoxy-(C₁-C₄)alkyl-acrylates or -methacrylates.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermoplastic, all-acrylic homopolymer and styrene/acrylic copolymer latexes that contain
water resistance promoters for use in ceramic tile adhesives.Ceramic tiles are used in many circumstances where water resistance is needed, for example, in bathrooms,
kitchens, and for exterior uses. All-acrylic homopolymers and styrene/acrylic copolymers are known to be useful bases
for adhesives for the tiles, but these polymers do not exhibit adequate adhesion and cohesion under conditions of high
humidity.This invention is a ceramic tile adhesive composition having improved water resistant
properties comprising a thermoplastic polymer which has a glass transition temperature of
10°C to 40°C, said polymer is the emulsion polymerization reaction product of a) at least
one monomer selected from the group consisting of C1-C12 alkyl esters of acrylic acid, and
C1-C12 alkyl esters of methacrylic acid; b) 2 to 10 weight percent, based on the total weight
of monomers, of at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of unsaturated C3-C6
monocarboxylic acids, unsaturated C4-C6 dicarboxylic acids and the C1-C4 half esters of
unsaturated C4-C6 dicarboxylic acids; c) 0.002 to 1 weight percent, based on the total weight
of monomers, of at least one multifunctional crosslinking monomer having two or more
polymerizable carbon-carbon double bonds per molecule; d) optionally, one or more
monomer(s) selected from the group consisting of styrene, C1-C4 alkyl substituted styrene,
halogenated styrene and unsaturated C3-C4 amides; and e) 0.5 to 5 weight percent, based on
the total weight of monomers, of at least one 2-acetoacetoxy-(C1-C4)alkyl-acrylate or -
methacrylate.The thermoplastic polymer particles of the latexes of this invention are broadly characterized as styrene/acrylic
copolymers and all-acrylic homopolymers that incorporate an acetoacetonate moiety derived from 2-acetoacetoxy (C1-C4)
alkyl acrylate or methacrylate. The acetoacetonate imparts water resistance to the polymer and will be polymerized
into the polymer in amounts from 0.5-5.0 parts per hundred parts by weight of monomer(s). Preferred acetoacetonate
monomers include acetoacetoxy propyl methacrylate, acetoacetoxy propyl acrylate, and acetoacetoxy ethyl acrylate
and acetoacetoxy ethyl methacrylate. These monomers can be prepared using known synthetic techniques; for example,
the following synthetic route may be used:

where R is hydrogen or methyl and n is the integer 2 or 3.Alternatively, acetoacetoxy alkyl acrylates or
