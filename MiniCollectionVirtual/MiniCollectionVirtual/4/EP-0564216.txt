<ABSTRACT>
Eye diseases or disorders are treated by an active agent being 
a melanotropin peptide or an analogue thereof, the analogue being an agent 

having a biological effect resembling that of the melanotropin peptide. The 
active agent may be administered topically onto the eye, by injection into the 

eye or systemically.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns the treatment of age related or 
other eye disorders. More specifically, the present invention concerns 
treatment of various eye disorders by the use of melantropin peptides such 
as α-MSH or analogues thereof. Age related degenerative changes in the eye's retina pigment 
epithilium (RPE), a highly pigmented epithilium underlying the retina, occur 
mainly in the macula area. Since the macula is the area which enables to 
discern small details and to read, its deterioration may bring about visual 
impairment and even blindness. Age related changes of varying degrees in 
the macula are evident in about 10% of subjects over 50 and about 25% of 
subjects over 75. One of the main factors responsible for age related 
macular degeneration (AMD) is aging of the Retinal Pigment Epithelium 
(RPE) at the macular area. In the intact eye, the RPE cells, through their 
phagocytic activity and active metabolism, constantly remove the toxic  
 
metabolites produced by the overlaying photoreceptoric retinal cells during 
the visual transduction process. As a consequence of the age dependent reduction in the 
metabolic and pharmaceutical activity of cells of the RPE, metabolic waste 
products are accumulated within these cells causing a slow deterioration of 
the activity of the RPE cells and their death. This deterioration, and death 
of cells occurs mainly in the macula region, eventually causes the degradation 
of the overlaying retinal layer and photoreceptors with subsequent 
impairment of vision or even blindness. Although AMD is the most prevalent cause of blindness in the 
elder population in developed countries, there is to date no effective 
treatment available to prevent the development of AMD or to ameliorate the 
condition following the onset of this disorder. Melanotropin (alpha melanocytic stimulating hormone 
(α-MSH)) is an N-Acetyl-tridecapeptide hormone which is synthesized and 
secreted by the intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland, and is known to 
control skin pigmentation in many animals by stimulating melanin synthesis 
and movement within integumental melanocytes. Recently, melanotropin 
has been also reported to affect other physiological functions including: 
endocrine and exocrine gland activities, temperature regulation, immuno 
modulation and nerve regeneration. Cellular responses to melanotropin in 
cultured melanoma cells include elevation of c-AMP levels, increase in 
melanin synthesis and stimulation of cell proliferation. Melanotropin was found to have
