<ABSTRACT>
Improvements for steam generators for household use. These machines are made 
up of a casing (1) which includes a water deposit (2) with an external inlet 

for filling and an internal conduit that leads to a boiler (8) with a heating 
element (9). An injection pump (5) has been placed in this conduit so that 

water can be sent to the boiler even when pressure inside the boiler builds 
up. A level meter (12) has been placed inside the boiler, and it activates 

or turns off the pump if the level drops or depending on the pre-established 
level inside the boiler. A steam outlet (14) goes from the boiler through a 

line valve to the outside, this line valve is regulated with the controls 
on the panel on the casing. Since the water deposit and the boiler are 

independent, the machine can be filled even when it is being used and the 
time needed to heat the water is reduced since the boiler where the steam 

is produced has less capacity. A vacuuming device has also been added on and 
it picks up the dirt dissolved in the condensed water sending it to an 

expansion chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The improvements mentioned for steam generators for household use would 
apply to those machines which produce steam for cleaning, ironing and other 
household chores, and that use either steam pistols, high pressure brushes or other 
cleaning accessories, or a steam iron for ironing clothes. Due to the special preparation for vacuuming the dirt dissolved in the condensed 
water used, it can be used in many more areas. There are various steam generators for household use and all of them use the same 
system: only one boiler with a heat generator that produces the vaporization of 
the water placed in the mentioned boiler. This means that it is necessary to use security plugs or other types of safety 
systems. Every time the internal pressure inside the container reaches an internal 
pressure of around 2 to 4 bar it can not be opened until the pressure in the boiler 
goes down. These boiler systems or systems with only one container need an electrical heating 
element that produces the adequate temperature of around 110° or 135° and 
time is wasted on heating the water so that it reaches the temperature necessary 
to produce enough steam to work with. The amount of time wasted depends on 
the capacity of the container. A container with a three litre water capacity , needs around 20 minutes to reach 
working temperatures and when the water is all used up, before refilling it, it is 
necessary to safely and slowly eliminate the pressure built up inside. This takes 
at least another 10 minutes, so by the time it's filled up again both procedures 
have taken up at least 30 minutes.  Moreover after cleaning, when using these units it is necessary to go through a 
second procedure, of picking up waste, condensed water etc... using other 
accessories. These pick-up systems are not always totally satisfactory, apart from 
the inconvenience of having to replace these accessories like rags and cleaning 
clothes. All these problems are solved with the improvements which this statement 
mentions. Noticeably improving the machines which are now in use. Improvement of steam generators for household use, specifically achieved by 
using a general external casing on which the controls, connections, handle for its 
use etc... are placed. A general water deposit has been placed inside. This water 
deposit has a window that indicates the water level, therefore allowing the user 
to visually check the water level from the outside. This deposit is connected to 
the boiler by a pump which sends water into the boiler even when

Improvement of steam generators for household use, characterized by the 
general casing, inside which a water deposit has been placed, with a filling conduit 

and a window used to check the water level. The Deposit is connected to the 
boiler by a pipe. An injection pump is placed between the deposit and the boiler 

in order to force the water into the boiler even if pressure has built up in the boiler. 
Improvement of steam generators for household use in accordance to the 
claims stated in the first section due to the fact that a heating element has been 

placed in the boiler along with a level meter, this device is electrically connected 
to the pump activating it every time the level drops or shutting it off when the 

correct level is reached. 
Improvement of steam generators for household use in accordance to the 
claims stated in the first and second sections, characterized by a steam outlet 

placed in the boiler that leads to an external outlet on the casing where the 
accessories are fitted on. A line valve controlled with the control panel has been 

placed in this conduit. 
Improvement of steam generators for household use in accordance to the 
claims stated in the first,second and third sections, characterized by adding a 

vacuum to the steam generator. A special filter connects the vacuum outlet to 
a waste chamber. The steam outlet goes through this chamber, which has a 

collecting system, and is connected to the accessory used on the machine and the 
inlet for vacuumed air. Therefore the dirt dissolved in the condensed water used 

for cleaning is picked up here. 
Improvements of steam generators for household use in accordance to the 
claims stated in the first, second, third and fourth sections, and characterized by 

to the fact that the deposit or waste chamber is made up of a deposit that picks 
up the water and that has a lateral inlet on one of its sides, a cover and a second 

cover which make up the expansion chamber. A deflector has been placed over 
 

the opening of the deposit. It is pointed dome shaped and its edges are placed 
near the interior sides of the deposit forming a cylinder like skirt, which overlaps 

on the central axial outlet of the deposit, forcing the air to go through a winding 
and expansive path. Water is deposited at the bottom of the deposit, while the air 

that carries solid waste is forced to go through the base of the axial conduit 
towards a second receptacle, where a paper bag picks up the solid waste letting 

the air through. 
Improvements of steam generators for household use in accordance to the 
claims stated in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth sections, and characterized 

by the fact that the deposit or waste chamber is easily detached from the casing 
and therefore can be emptied and cleaned making it possible to use only the 

vacuum or steam generator one at a time or both at the same time by fitting on 
the appropriate handle.
