<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a holder for hexagonal wrenches which can 
compactly house a plurality of hexagonal wrenches therein and 

also be used as a grip for hexagonal wrenches. Around the outer 
peripheral surface of the holder body (1) is formed a corrugated 

portion (4) to provide a gripping portion (5). Said holder body (1) is 
formed with fitting holes (6,) corresponding to each size of 

hexagonal wrenches (2.) Then, into the fitting holes (6) are 
inserted the shafts (2A) of the hexagonal wrenches (2) in order to 

incorporate the hexagonal wrenches (2) in the holder body (1.) 
According to the structure of the invention, a plurality of 

hexagonal wrenches (2) of different sizes can be compactly housed 
in the holder body (1.) Further, the hexagonal wrenches (2) are 

nearly integrated with the holder body (1,) which are able to be 
utilized as a grip for hexagonal wrenches (2.)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a holder for hexagonal 
wrenches provided for housing a plurality of hexagonal wrenches 
of different diameters therein. In general, as hexagonal wrenches are provided as a set 
of a plurality of hexagonal wrenches of different diameters, 
there are some fear that some of them will be missing in the 
event that they are separately kept. To solve the above problem, there is provided an 
arranging tool in Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No.3-82176, 
wherein at the center of a base is mounted a horizontally 
rotatable tabular housing plate by a supporting shaft, said 
housing plate being formed with through-holes corresponding to 
each diameter of each hexagonal wrench, being spaced by a 
predetermined distance. And then, inserting said hexagonal 
wrenches into the through-holes, thereby hooking each operating 
portion at the distal ends of said hexagonal wrenches to said 
housing plate so as to enable the batch-housing of a plurailty 
of said hexagonal wrenches. Whereas, as the above-mentioned arranging tool is 
provided with the base and the housing plate rotatably mounted 
thereabove, it is inevitably to become a large type, 
necessitating a relatively wide space to keep it, which is 
incovenient to carry it about. Furthermore, the smaller the 
diameters of hexagonal wrenches of this kind become, the less  
 
their lengths will become in general, so that the gripping 
shafts or handles thereof will become shorter and the diameters 
smaller. As a result, such an arranging tool has a problem such 
that it is difficult to operate or revolve the hexagonal wrenches. Accordingly, it is the main object of the present 
invention to provide a holder for hexagonal wrenches which can 
compactly house or accomodate a plurality of hexagonal wrenches. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a holder for hexagonal wrenches of which the holder 
portion can be also utilized for a gripping portion for the 
hexagonal wrenches. In accordance with a major feature of the present 
invention, there is provided a structure of a holder for 
hexagonal wrenches comprising:
 
   a holder body whose peripheral surface is formed with a 
gripping portion;
 
   a plurality of fitting holes provided along the 
longitudinal length of said holder body, corresponding to each 
diameter of said hexagonal wrenches, which are fitted into said 
fitting holes in order to incorporate the hexagonal wrenches in 
said holder body. Other objects, features and advantages of the invention 
will be

<CLAIMS>
A holder for a plurality of hexagonal wrenches 2 of 

different sizes comprising: 
   a holder body 1 having a gripping portion 5 around the 

peripheral surface thereof; 
   a plurality of fitting holes 6 provided along the longitudinal 

length of said holder body 1, corresponding to each diameter of 
said hexagonal wrenches 2, said each hexagonal wrench 2 being 

fitted into said each fitting hole 6 corresponding thereto. 
A holder for a plurality of hexagonal wrenches of different 
sizes according to claim 1, wherein said holder body 1 is formed 

with helically-sloped portions 3 at the both ends thereof, said 
helically-sloped portions 3 being formed symmetrical each other. 
A holder for a plurality of hexagonal wrenches of different 
sizes according to claim 1, wherein said holder body 1 are 

formed with a corrugated portion 4 along its longitudinal length 
around the outer peripheral surface thereof. 
A holder for a plurality of hexagonal wrenches of different 
sizes according to claim 1, wherein said fitting holes 6 are 

formed in approximately the same circular arc, said each fitting 
hole 6 being spaced by a predetermined distance. 
A holder for a plurality of hexagonal wrenches of different 
sizes according to claim 1, which is characterized in that: 

   said holder body 1 is capable of being used both as a holder 
and a grip.
