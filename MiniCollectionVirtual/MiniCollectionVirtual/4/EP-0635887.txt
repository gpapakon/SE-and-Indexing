<ABSTRACT>
- Device associating a bipolar transistor (10) and a junction field-effect transistor (12) with a view to producing a higher output voltage (Vd) than the voltage BVCEO of the bipolar transistor (10). - A lateral extension (30) of the base region (28) forming the gate of the field-effect transistor is equipped with an aperture (38) in which a drain region (40) is situated. A heavily doped peripheral region (36), of the same type as the drain region (40), surrounds the lateral extension (30), on three sides, while a heavily doped buried layer region (34), forming a conducting collector part of the bipolar transistor (10), extends to under the peripheral region (36) and, with the latter, forms the source of the field-effect transistor (12). - Application: integrated circuits.

An integrated device formed by the combination of a bipolar transistor
(10) and a junction field effect transistor (12), comprising:


a collector zone formed, on the one hand, by a portion (32) of a weakly doped epitaxial
layer (20) of the first conductivity type supported by a weakly doped substrate (22) of

the second conductivity type, and, on the other hand, by a heavily doped buried layer
region (34) of the first conductivity type,
a heavily doped emitter zone (26) of a first conductivity type, extending above the
buried layer region (34),
a base zone (28) which is less heavily doped than the emitter zone, which is of a second
conductivity type opposed to the first type, in which the emitter zone (26) is included,

and which comprises a lateral extension (30) forming a gate for the field effect
transistor,
said device in addition comprising a heavily doped peripheral region (36) of the first
conductivity type which surrounds the base zone (28) and its lateral extension (30) at

least partly and at a certain distance,

characterized in that the lateral extension (30) of the base zone comprises an opening
(38) in which a drain region (40) for the field effect transistor is situated, which drain

region is heavily doped of the first conductivity type, is completely surrounded by said

lateral extension (30) and is separated therefrom by a given lateral distance (w), and in
that the buried layer region (34), which is of elongate shape, extends in longitudinal

direction to beyond the assembly of the base zone and its lateral extension so as to be
covered by said peripheral region (36), this latter region forming together with the

buried layer region (34) the source of the field effect transistor (12).
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the lateral extension
(30) of the base zone is bounded by an adjacent region (42) of the same conductivity

type and more weakly doped along the edge of the opening (38) comprising the drain
region (40). 
A device as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the thickness of the
epitaxial layer (20) and the doping concentration of this layer are chosen to be such that

said epitaxial layer, in a region adjoining said adjacent more weakly doped region (42),
is completely depleted of charge carriers at a given voltage applied to the junction

formed between the drain region (40) and the gate (30) of the field effect transistor
(12), which given voltage is lower than the breakdown voltage of said junction.
A device as claimed in claim 2 or 3, characterized in that it comprises, in
this order, on the surface of the device,


a first insulating layer (44),
a first field electrode (46) formed by a conductive layer in contact with the lateral
extension (30) of the base zone through a first opening (48) in the first insulating layer

(44) and extending on the first insulating layer over said adjacent more weakly doped
region (42), in the direction of the drain region (40) over a distance smaller than half

the said lateral distance (w),
a first part (50a) of a second field electrode, conductive and in contact with the drain
region (40) through a second opening (52) in the first insulating layer (44), and

extending in lateral direction on the first insulating layer in the direction of the first
field electrode (46) over a distance smaller than half the said lateral distance (w),

a second insulating layer (54),
and a second part (50b) of the second field electrode, conductive and in contact with the
first part (50a) of this same electrode through an opening (56) in the second insulating

layer, and extending laterally on the second insulating layer in the direction of the first
field electrode (46) at least up to close to this first electrode.
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the
field effect transistor (12) is formed by two parts arranged symmetrically relative to a

longitudinal axis of the buried layer region (34), of which parts the homologous regions
(60a, 60b) are electrically connected in parallel, and in that the peripheral region (36)

completely surrounds the base zone and its lateral extension (30).
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the
field effect transistor is formed by a plurality of cells (12a, 12b ... 12i) laterally aligned 

relative to the bipolar transistor (10), the peripheral region (36) of one cell (12b) having
a part (37) in common with that of the cell (12a) adjacent thereto, while the homologous

regions are interconnected in parallel with one another.
