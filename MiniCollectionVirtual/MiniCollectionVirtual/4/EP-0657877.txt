<ABSTRACT>
A position detector (11, 12) detects a relative 
position of an optical head (2) to a recording medium (1), 

and on the basis of the thus-detected relative position, a 
position detection signal (D) is generated in response to 

movement of a light beam (6) over a predetermined distance. 
Then, in response to the position detection signal, a 

comparison is made between the number (Na) of track crossing 
counted for the predetermined movement distance on the basis 

of reception of reflection of the light beam (6), and a 
predetermined reference value (Nb) for the predetermined 

movement distance. Then, track crossing count compensation 
data (Nc) is generated which corresponds to a difference 

between the counted number of track crossing and the 
reference value, and the counted number of track crossing is 

corrected by use of such compensation data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an optical
information recording and reproducing apparatus, and more
particularly to a track seek method and device which are
used for successively recognizing every current track
position onto which the light beam is irradiated, and for
positioning the light beam on a desired target track.Optical disks and optical cards have conventionally
been known as optical information recording media on which
high-density recording and reproduction of information are
performed by use of light. On the optical information
recording media are provided a plurality of optically
detectable guide tracks to function as a guide for recording
or reproduction of desired information, and data tracks are
each provided between every two adjacent guide tracks.
Information is recorded in the form of "pits" each having a
size of about 1 to 3 Âµm by irradiation of a minutely
converged light beam on the data track. For each of the
data tracks is defined a unique track number.To successively perform information recording or
reproduction on such an optical information recording medium 
by moving the light beam from a current track number (i.e.,
a track onto which the light beam is currently being
irradiated) to a new track number, the light beam must be
moved in a direction across the guide tracks and positioned
at the new or target track number. Each time the light beam
crosses the guide track, reflection of the light beam from
the guide track is received to be converted into an
electrical signal. This electrical signal is amplified and
shaped so as to generate a guide-track-crossing signal
representative of the guide track crossing by the light
beam. By counting the generated guide-track-crossing signals
one by one, it is possible to successively recognize a
specific track on which the light beam is being currently
located. This can be used as a feedback value to move the
light beam to the vicinity of the target track. A series of
these operations is collectively called a "track seek"
operation or technique. May examples of the prior art track
seek technique are known from, for example, Japanese Patent
Laid-open Publication Nos. SHO 56-134364 and SHO 62-154273.If some flaw, scratch or dirt exists in or on the
optical information recording medium, however, a light
reception or guide-track-crossing signal of appropriate level
can not be obtained when the light beam crosses the guide
track. This would cause errors in the guide-track-crossing
signals, so that the light beam tends to be wrongly
