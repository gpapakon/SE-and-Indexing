<ABSTRACT>
A dry film lubricant coat is applied by the transfer pad process to a piston (10) to lessen the stresses associated with reciprocating engine parts and method for applying such a coat to the skirt of a piston. Wetted dry film lubricants are diluted with volatile solvents to create a wetted dry film lubricant of liquid consistency in order to make the dry film lubricants adaptable to the transfer pad coating process. Application of the wetted dry film lubricant to the piston (10) by the transfer pad coating process provides for the precise and discriminant application of dry film lubricants to piston skirts (12a and 12b) thereby providing a less costly coated piston by avoiding the time-consuming task of masking the pistons prior to application of a wetted dry film lubricant by the currently used spray method and eliminating the waste and pollution problems associated with the spray method.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a piston having a defined
dry film lubricant coated surface and to a process and
apparatus of coating a defined surface of a piston with a
dry film lubricant.It will be appreciated that during operation of an
engine having reciprocating engine parts which involve
frictionally engaging piston and cylinder members,
surface portions of the pistons are exposed to enormous
stresses and experience high sliding speeds. These
stresses generally result in the wearing of materials and
deterioration during the operation of the piston-cylinder
devices. It has been proposed heretofore that a wear
resistant dry lubricant film be bonded to the piston
skirts to protect against these stresses and improve
engine efficiency.To form the dry lubricant film on the piston skirt,
heretofore a wetted dispersion of the dry film lubricant
has been applied by means of a spraying apparatus using a
suitably dilute solution of the film lubricant. Such a
method, however, requires that all areas of the piston
other than the piston skirt be masked or covered to
prevent them from being contacted by the lubricant
dispersion. Masking of the pistons is quite time-consuming
and, therefore, quite costly. Masking also
does not always avoid coating undesirable portions of the 
piston with lubricant is wasteful and causes pollution
problems. Presently, there are no known methods
available for precisely and discriminately applying dry
film lubricants to piston skirts. The current spray
method for application of dry film lubricants to the
friction bearing surfaces of pistons are time-consuming,
waste lubricant and cause pollution.US-A-4987865 discloses a piston for an internal
combustion engine whose skirt is coated with a
fluorocarbon polymer. The coating can be applied using
conventional methods.US-A-4060031 discloses a decorative ink printing
apparatus in which ink is applied to an intaglio matrix
and then scraped off so that the ink remains in the
matrix depressions. A printing pad of silicon rubber is
pressed on to the matrix so that it takes up ink from the
matrix depressions. The printing pad is then moved by a
support therefor to print the taken-up ink on the
material to be printed which is located at a print
carrier.A Tampoprint Brochure on Tampo-printing Machines,
issued October 1987 discusses a decorative tampo-printing
machine in which an etched cliche is covered with ink by
a spatula, the ink is drawn back off the cliche by a
doctor blade, exposing an etching containing ink, a
silicon rubber tampon picks up
