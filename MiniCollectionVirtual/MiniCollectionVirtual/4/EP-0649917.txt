<ABSTRACT>
This invention is directed to a controlled low profile electrodeposited 
copper foil. In one embodiment this foil has a substantially uniform randomly 

oriented grain structure that is essentially columnar grain free and twin boundary free 
and has an average grain size-of up to about 10 microns. In one embodiment this foil 

has an ultimate tensile strength measured at 23°C in the range of about 87,000 to 
about 120,000 psi and an elongation measured at 180°C of about 15% to about 28%. 

The invention is also directed to a process for making the foregoing foil, the process 
comprising: (A) flowing an electrolyte solution between an anode and a cathode and 

applying an effective amount of voltage across said anode and said cathode to deposit 
copper on said cathode; said electrolyte solution comprising copper ions, sulfate ions 

and at least one organic additive or derivative thereof, the chloride ion concentration 
of said solution being up to about 1 ppm; the current density being in the range of 

about 0.1 to about 5 A/cm²; and (B) removing copper foil from said cathode.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrodeposited copper foils which are useful
in making printed circuit boards (PCBs), and to a process for making such foils.The production of copper foil by electrodeposition involves the use of
an electroforming cell containing an anode, a cathode, an electrolyte solution and a
source of current. The cathode is cylindrical in shape and the anode conforms to the
curvature of the cathode to maintain a constant separation between the two. The
electrolyte solution, which contains copper ions and sulfate ions, flows between the
anode and the cathode. Voltage is applied between the anode and the cathode and
copper deposits on the cathode. The copper feed stock, which is typically copper
shot, copper wire or recycled copper, is dissolved in sulfuric acid to form the 
electrolyte solution. Various types of agents such as animal glue, thiourea and
chloride ions are typically added to the electrolyte solution to control the foil
properties.Electrodeposited copper foil is supplied to PCB manufacturers in the
form of laminates. These laminates are formed by bonding the copper foil to a
polymeric insulating resin. The copper foil portion of the laminate is etched to form
the conductive paths of the PCB using processes known to those skilled in the art.
The etched copper conductive paths provide electrical connection between various
portions of an electronic device.To be acceptable for PCB applications, it is desirable that copper foils
have controlled low profiles to provide etchability and impedance control. It is
preferred that these foils have high ultimate tensile strengths (UTS) to provide desired
handling and surface quality characteristics, and high elongations at elevated
temperatures to resist cracking. Foils having high profiles result in laminates that
exhibit measles and embedded copper. Foils having profiles that are too low result
in laminates with insufficient bond strength. Foils with low elongations at elevated
temperatures crack when temperature stressed. Foils with low UTS's wrinkle during
handling.The prior art suggests copper foils having many of these attributes, but
there is a continuing demand for higher quality copper foils. By virtue of the
inventive process, which involves the use of electrolyte solutions employing organic
additives and critical concentrations of chloride ions below about 1 ppm, higher
quality copper foils of the type that are acceptable for PCB applications are achieved.Lakshmanan et al, "The Effect of Chloride Ion in the Electrowinning
