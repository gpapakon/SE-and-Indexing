<ABSTRACT>
A drive module for electrical medium-voltage switches has motors, magnetic releases and the like as well as means for operating, controlling, signalling and monitoring with the necessary electrical and mechanical connections. In order to ensure a high level of functional reliability with simple design, at least the means for controlling and signalling operating sequences are mounted and wired up on a common equipment support (7), the equipment support (7) being held on the drive support (1) as a structural unit.
