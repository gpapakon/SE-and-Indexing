<ABSTRACT>
The descrition relates to a process for metallising plastics in which the plastic surface is pretreated first in a solution of swelling agent containing compounds of general formula R1-(O-(CH2)n)m-OCO-R2 in which R1, R2 = CkH2k+1, n = 2 or 3 and k, m = 1, 2, 3 or 4, and then in a solution containing permanganate ions. In addition, there is an improved process for coating especially polymers with metal which provides better adhesion of the metal to the polymer substrate and a greater stability of the metal-polymer bond and reduced noble metal consumption in the catalysis/activation of the polymer surface.

Method of coating plastics material parts with
metals, more especially for shielding from electromagnetic

radiation by at least one of the deposited metal layers,
having the method steps:

,

wherein

R

,
n = 2 or 3, and
k, m = 1, 2, 3 or 4,
b. etching with a solution containing permanganate
ions,
c. subsequently coating the plastics material parts
with precious metal powders, in order to activate the

plastics material parts for the subsequent currentless
metallisation,
d. currentlessly depositing a first layer, which is
in contact with the plastics material and formed from

metals selected from the group consisting of nickel,
cobalt, palladium, gold and their alloys,
e. then currentlessly depositing a second metal layer
formed from copper, and
f. currentlessly depositing on the second layer at
least a third layer formed from metals selected from the

group consisting of nickel, cobalt, palladium, gold and
their alloys.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the first currentlessly deposited metal layer is applied

at a deposition speed of less than 5 Âµm/h.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the first currentlessly deposited

metal layer is substantially formed from nickel.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the first currentlessly deposited 

metal layer is formed from a nickel/phosphorus alloy or
nickel/boron alloy.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that, prior to being treated in the

swelling solution, the plastic material parts are initially
cleaned in a solution containing wetting agents in a

separate treatment step.
