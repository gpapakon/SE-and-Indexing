<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thin cast strip 
and a thin steel sheet of a common carbon steel produced 
by using as a raw material molten steel containing large 
amounts of copper and tin obtained by melting and 
refining scrap iron or tin plate scrap generated, for 
example, by dismantling of automobiles or electric 
appliances, and a process for producing the same. In the prior art, in order to reuse scrap iron, tin 
plate scrap, etc., these scrap metals had to be fed in 
suitable amounts into molten steel at the time of 
refining of the molten steel. The molten steel 
containing the scrap iron and the like was then refined 
and subjected to ingot making or continuous casting to 
prepare an ingot or a slab having a thickness of not less 
than 100 mm which was then rolled to prepare a thin sheet 
or the like. Particularly in recent years, however, the amount of 
copper contained in scrap iron has become large. When an 
ingot or a slab containing the scrap iron or tin plate 
scrap is hot-rolled and, if necessary, then cold-rolled 
to prepare a thin steel sheet having a thickness in the 
range of from 0.1 to 15 mm, red-shortness occurs in the 
ingot or cast strip in the course of the hot rolling and 
hot tear frequently occurs, which makes it difficult to 
conduct hot rolling, so that the production of the above-described 
thin steel sheet becomes very difficult. The red-shortness occurs as follows. When a cast 
strip or the like is heated before hot rolling, since 
copper (Cu) and tin (Sn) are less likely to scale, they 
are enriched on the surface layer portion of the cast  
 
strip without being removed as a scale. The enriched Cu 
and Sn form a low-melting liquid film and, at the same 
time, are unevenly distributed at grain boundaries, which 
renders the grain boundaries fragile at a hot rolling 
temperature, so that red shortness occurs. Further, Cu and Sn are ingredients which are 
difficult to remove from molten steel by refining. Therefore, scrap iron and the like containing large 
amounts of Cu and Sn are blended little by little in many 
divided charges for use in lowered Cu and Sn 
concentrations. The above method, however, presents the problem that 
the Cu and Sn concentrations of the steel product 
gradually increase during a use cycle for a long period 
of time. Further, the control and work associated with 
the blending of the scrap iron little by little in many 
divided charges are very troublesome. In order to solve the above problem, as described in 
"Tekko To Gokin Genso"
