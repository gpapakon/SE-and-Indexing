<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to tripeptide compounds which
are novel analogs of glutathione. The invention also concerns
panels of tripeptides that are glutathione analogs which have
diverse properties and are useful for characterizing glutathione
transferases (GSTs) and as solution phase inhibitors of GST.Glutathione (GSH), in its reduced form, is a
tripeptide of the formula: γ-Glu-Cys-Gly. Reduced glutathione
has a central role in maintaining the redox condition in cells
and is also an essential substrate for glutathione S-transferase
(GST) which facilitates the detoxification of foreign substances
by a number of mechanisms, including catalysis of the coupling
of an electrophilic portion of a toxin, for instance, to
glutathione, rendering the toxin more susceptible to clearance.
A second mechanism, which also involves glutathione as
substrate, resides in the reduction of peroxides with the
concomitant oxidation of glutathione.Adang, A.E.P., et al., Biochem J (1990) 269:47-54,
described tripeptide analogs of GSH which interact with various
GST isoenzymes at different concentrations. These analogs are
modified forms of GSH in which at least one of the glycine,
cysteine, or gamma-glutamine residues is replaced by an
alternate amino acid residue.Additional modified forms have been disclosed, for
example, by Principato, G.B., et al., Enzyme (1989) 41:175-180,
who studied the effect of a tripeptide GSH analog on glyoxalase
II enzyme of rat liver. The tripeptide used by this group was
of the formula γ-Glu-ρ-chlorophenylcarbonylmethyl-Cys-Ser.
Morris, D., in Biochem J (1960) 76:349-353, described the
synthesis of γ-Glu-benzyl-Cys-Val. A large number of GSH
tripeptide analogs containing a substitution for only one of the
three GSH amino acids have been reported and are commercially
available. WO-A-92/19767 refers to methods for selecting therapeutic
modulators which affect, preferentially, the glutathione-S-transferase
(GST) complement of normal or unwanted cells or tissues.Sheh et al, Int. J. Peptide Protein Res.35:55-62 (1990) refers to
the synthesis of two cyclic peptide homologues of glutathione, namely
cyclo (Glu [Cys-β-Ala-]-OH) and cyclo (Glu [Cys-Gaba-]-OH).The invention described hereinbelow concerns novel
glutathione tripeptide analogs which are useful as affinity
ligands on chromatographic supports and as members of panels
which are used to characterize the various isoenzymes of
glutathione-S-transferase. Glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs)
are present in the form of a number of isoenzymes which differ
