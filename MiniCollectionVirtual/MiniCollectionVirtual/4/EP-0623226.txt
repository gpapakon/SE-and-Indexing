<DESCRIPTION>
OPTICAL APPARATUS FOR USE WITH LASER PRINTERS AND THE LIKEThe present invention relates to an optical apparatus for use with, for example, laser printers, photocopiers, and other scanning apparatus. One arrangement comprises optical apparatus such as a scanning apparatus of variable focal length. In one arrangement optical apparatus is provided for scanning a beam across an object field (eg, laser printers and photocopiers), usually in the form of a surface eg: a photosensitive drum) and in another arrangement apparatus may be provided for receiving radiation (eg, detection scanning apparatus for detecting, for example, faults in a web material such as paper, or plastic film), the area from which the radiation is received being scanned. Another arrangement comprises optical apparatus for moving a beam so as to track a moveable reflective surface such as a facet of a mirror drum.For convenience, in this specification we will generally refer to optical wavelengths, and in particular will use expressions such as "optical", "beam", "light" and so on but it will be understood that the invention is applicable to radiation of other wavelengths, such as infrared and ult raviol et .Simple laser scanners (shown diagrammat ical 1y in Figure 1 ) 

scan an incident focused laser beam 10A via a polygon mirror drum 11 having a plurality of mirror facets 11A, 11B etc which is rotatable about an axis 12. The reflected laser beam 10B is truly in focus on the arc of a circle centered at the scan origin. We will refer to this arc as the focal line 13. In practice if a flat surface 14 is to be scanned the laser spot diameter is limited to a size where the depth of focus is great enough to cover the excursion of the focal line 13 from the flat surface 14 (a +- b in Figure 1 ) .If greater resolution is required in the scan, ie, a smaller spot size than is allowed in a simple scanner, then a field flattening lens 16 is usually sited between the mirror drum 11 and the scanned surface 14 as shown in Figure 2. A multi element lens system 16 can be designed to produce up to approximately 30,000 spots resolved in a line. However, if the flattening of the field is to be accurate this requires a very expensive special lens system 16 if scanning takes place over a large angle.Another difficulty is that in a confocal laser scanning system 16 in which the reflected beam from the flat surface 14 is collected by the mirror drum 11 both the outgoing scan beam 10B and the returned light 10C are on the same oath so that the returned light
