<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of a fabric softening clay
as an additive in a fabric washing composition comprising an
anionic surfactant, a nonionic surfactant and a proteolytic
enzyme.In GB-A-1 400 898 (Procter & Gamble/STORM
a detergent and softening composition is taught
which includes a smectite clay containing material having a
cation exchange capacity of at least 50 meq/100g, together
with a detergent active material. Enzymes are suggested as a
possible additive to the composition.EP-A-612 841, published on 31.08.94, is a copending application which discloses
compositions comprising a clay to control/prevent pilling of
fabrics made of keratin containing fibres whilst providing a
softening benefit.DE-A-2162177 discloses washing compositions comprising a
proteolytic enzyme and an anionic surfactant including soap.
EP-A-0-277 571 discloses washing compositions comprising low
levels of protease enzymes, anionic surfactants and nonionic
surfactant, used in combinations with clay softeners for the washing of woollen fabrics.Likewise SU-A01606557 discloses detergent compositions
comprising proteolytic enzymes and bentonite for washing woollen fabrics.Recently it has become the practice to incorporate more
enzymes in fabric washing compositions so that the
compositions can be used at lower temperatures to save energy
and reduce the damage to clothes caused by high temperature
washing. There is also a trend towards washing woollen
garments in the washing machine, even if they are marked
'hand wash only'. The damage caused by washing wool in a
fabric washing composition containing high levels of
proteolytic enzyme can be considerable in terms of weight 
loss of the fabric, shrinkage and eventual disintegration of
the garment by formation of holes.According to the present invention there is provided the use
of from 2 to 30% by weight of a fabric softening clay as an
additive to reduce or prevent wash damage other than pilling of woollen articles
in a fabric washing composition comprising an anionic
surfactant, a nonionic surfactant and a proteolytic enzyme.The advantage of such a use of a fabric softening clay is
that the damage to the woollen clothes may be considerably
reduced without a reduction in the detergency of the fabric
washing composition. It might be expected that if the clay
were inhibiting the enzyme activity, then this would result
in reduced detergency, especially of proteinaceous stains.
Surprisingly this does not happen.The clay may be added in the form of a granule comprising 10
to 30%
