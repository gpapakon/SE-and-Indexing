<ABSTRACT>
A needle valve having improved economy of manufacture and assembly 
is disclosed in 

which the tapered end of the needle (32) moves axially with respect to a 
valve seat (16) having 

a cylindrical opening but does not rotate. An adjusting means (48), in 
turn, is rotated to 

cause the axial movement of the needle and an alignment means, 
preferably a sphere (74), 

is interposed between the needle and the adjusting means to provide 
alignment between 

the two components. The needle itself is also spring biased away 
from the valve seat.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to flow control valves and, more particularly, to a needle valve 
having a non-rotating tapered needle that moves axially along its main axis within 
concentric cylindrical bores to control the flow of a fluid. Currently, needle valves are used in a fairly wide variety of applications where precision 
and accuracy are required in controlling the flow of a fluid. One of such uses is in the 
area of medical anesthesia machines, such as is described in Braatz U.S. Patent 
4,226,573. In such present needle valves, the needle is a tapered member that is 
rotated by the user and such rotation causes the needle to move with respect to its seat 
by virtue of a threaded engagement of the needle within a housing. As the needle 
moves with respect to the seat, obviously, the flow of the fluid is controlled. One difficulty with such needle valves, however, is in achieving precise concentricity 
of the needle with respect to its seat which is a torroidal (donut shaped) opening 
through which the fluid passes. Since conventional needles rotate as they are moved 
axially with respect to their seats, if the needle is out of round, a slight turn could cause 
flow to change in an unpredictable manner and an intended decrease of flow could 
actually turn out to increase the flow through the valve. The out of round could be created by a needle that is slightly bent or, alternately, by 
some minute misalignment between the longitudinal axis of the threaded engagement 
between the valve housing and the needle and/or the longitudinal axis of the cylindrical 
seat. In any case, the out of round difficulty raises problems with accurate control of 
the fluid. Correction of the problem can require considerable expense in 
precisemachining, inspection and correction of misalignments during the manufacturing 
process. One solution to the problem was suggested in Braatz U.S. Patent 4,575,043 where the 
needle was deliberately bent so that it physically touched the valve seat at all times in 
the control of the flow. As such, the profile of the passage through which the fluid 
passes remains the same, however, the Braatz needle valve utilized a long flexible 
needle and contact with internal surface of the valve seat was a rather light contact.  In the needle valves of the type herein concerned, however, the needles are more rigid 
and a continual wiping of the internal surface of the valve seat over time can cause 
wear of the seat and enlarge the opening. Accordingly, for the same setting of the 
needle, the

A needle valve comprising a valve housing 10 having an inlet 20 and an outlet 22 
and a flow path formed therebetween, a valve seat 16 in said flow path, 

characterised in that a needle 32 has a distal end within said valve seat 16 and 
a proximal end, said needle 32 being contained within said valve housing 10 and 

adapted to move axially with respect to said valve seat 16 to control the flow of 
fluid passing between said inlet 20 and said outlet 22, an adjusting means 48 

threadedly engaged within said valve housing 10 and rotatable to move axially 
with respect to said valve seat 16, and an alignment means 46, 74 interposed 

between the proximal end of said needle 32 and said adjusting means 48 to align 
said adjusting means 48 and said needle 32 to move axially along the same axis. 
A needle valve for control of the flow of a gas, said needle valve comprising a 

valve housing 10, said valve housing 10 having an inlet 20 and an outlet 22 and 
defining a flow path for the flow of gas between said inlet 20 and said outlet 22, 

a valve seat 16 in said flow path, characterised in that a needle 32 has a distal 
tapered end and a proximal end, said distal end being positioned within said valve 

seat 16 and movable toward and away from said seat 16 to decrease and 
increase, respectively, the flow of gas through said seat 16 passing from said inlet 

20 to said outlet 22, bias means 42 adapted to bias said needle 32 away from 
said valve seat 16, an adjusting means 48 threadedly engaged within said valve 

housing 10, said adjusting means 48 being rotatable with respect to said housing

the proximal end of said needle 32 and said adjusting means 48, said adjusting 

means 48 aligning said adjusting means 48 and said proximal end of said needle 
32 and allowing the lateral movement of said adjusting means 48, but not the 

rotational movement, to laterally move said needle 32 with respect to said valve 
seat 16 to control the flow of the fluid passing therethrough.
