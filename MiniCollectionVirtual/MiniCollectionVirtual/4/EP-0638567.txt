<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drug containing 
a 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,4-dioxoquinazoline derivative or a 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an active 
ingredient, which inhibits nucleoside uptake of the cells to 
increase an extracellular adenosine concentration and is 
therefore useful for the protection of myocardium against 
myocardosis due to anoxemia or hypoxia, such as ischemia and 
reperfusion disorders, and for the prevention or treatment of 
inflammation, such as leg and foot edema. With respect to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,4-dioxoquinazoline 
derivatives having a 1-(6,7-dimethoxy-4-quinazolyl)-4-piperidinyl 
group at the 3-position, those 
having a hydrogen atom, a chlorine atom or a nitro group at 
the 6-position are described in Chem. Pharm. Bull., 38, 1591-1595 
(1990). Further, it is known that a compound having 
adenosine uptake inhibitory activity exhibits myocardium 
protecting activity [Circul., 80, 1400-1411 (1989); Am. J. 
Physiol., H1570-1577 (1991); J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol., 20, 
173-178 (1992)]. The present invention relates to an adenosine 
uptake inhibitor and an agent for the myocardium protection 
or the prevention or treatment of inflammatory edema which 
contain as an active ingredient a 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,4-dioxoquinazoline 
derivative represented by formula (I):  wherein R¹ represents hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted 
lower alkyl, alkenyl, or substituted or unsubstituted 
aralkyl; R², R³, R⁴, and R⁵ independently represent hydrogen, 
halogen, amino, mono- or di(lower alkyl)amino, lower 
alkanoylamino, nitro, cyano, substituted or unsubstituted 
lower alkyl, hydroxy, lower alkoxy, lower alkylthio, carboxy, 
lower alkoxycarbonyl, lower alkanoyl, aralkyloxy, or lower 
alkanoyloxy; R⁶, R⁷, R⁸, and R⁹ independently represent 
hydrogen, hydroxy, substituted or unsubstituted lower alkoxy, 
or aralkyloxy, or any adjoining two of them are combined to 
form methylenedioxy; R¹⁰ represents hydrogen or lower alkyl; 
and Y and Z independently represent N or C-R¹¹ (wherein R¹¹ 
represents hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted lower 
alkyl, or halogen), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt 
thereof. The present invention also relates to a method for 
protecting myocardium or preventing or treating inflammatory 
edema and a method for preventing or treating diseases caused 
by adenosine uptake, which comprise administering an 
effective amount of a 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,4-dioxoquinazoline 
derivative represented by formula (I) or a pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt
