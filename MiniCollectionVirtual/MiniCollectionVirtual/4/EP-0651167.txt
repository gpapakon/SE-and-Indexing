<ABSTRACT>
In a longitudinal guide for machine units, particularly wood-working machines, with at least two guide components (1, 2), which are provided with guide surfaces (4, 7; 4a, 7a) and one of which reaches through the other and one of which is arranged in a fixed manner and the other in a displacement manner, simplicity of production and high accuracy of guidance can be achieved if the inner guide component (1) is designed as a flexurally rigid beam which has two diametrically opposite guide surfaces (4, 4a) with their axes parallel which, transversely to the axial direction, are in positive engagement with associated guide surfaces (7, 7a) of the outer guide component (2), which is designed as a housing which surrounds the inner guide component (1) with a clearance in the areas outside the guide surfaces (4, 7; 4a, 7a) and those areas of which which contain the guide surfaces (4, 7; 4a, 7a) can be clamped together by means of a tightening device (14, 15).
