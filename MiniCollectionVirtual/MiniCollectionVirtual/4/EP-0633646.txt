<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a bearing arrangement (4) for electric motors, particularly external-rotor motors, at least one bearing element (6) being provided in order to bear a rotor such that it can rotate. This bearing element (6) is seated in a receptacle in a bearing retaining part (12) of a stator (2). The receptacle (10) in the bearing retaining part (12) is formed on the one hand by dimensionally stable sections (26) which position the bearing element (6) by resting against at least three circumferentially distributed points, and, on the other hand, by at least one section (28) which can be deformed elastically in the radial direction and holds the bearing element (6) by means of force-fitting contact.

Bearing arrangement (4) for an electric motor, in 
particular of the external rotor type, in which at least 

one bearing element (6; 8) is provided to support and allow 
rotation of a rotor, the said element being seated in a 

mounting (10) of a bearing holder (12; 14) of a stator,
characterized in that
 
the mounting (10) of the bearing holder (12; 14) comprises, 

on the one hand, sections (26) having inherently stable 
shape which hold the bearing element (6; 8) in position by 

resting against it in at least three circumferentially 
distributed places, and on the other hand, at least one 

section (28) which can be elastically deformed in a radial 
direction such as to grip the bearing element (6; 8) by 

force-locking pressure against it. 
Bearing arrangement according to Claim 1,
characterized in that
 
at least two and preferably three elastically deformable 

sections (28) are distributed around the circumference. 
Bearing arrangement according to Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that
 
the two types of sections (26, 28) of the mounting (10) are 

uniformly distributed around the circumference of the 
mounting (10) of the bearing holder (12; 14) in 

alternation, the number of sections (26, 28) of each kind 
being equal and, in particular, six. 
Bearing arrangement according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
3,
characterized in that
 
before fitting of the bearing element (6; 8), the area of 

the elastically deformable section (28), or each of them, 
projects a slight distance in the radial direction inwards 

into a cylindrical contour defined by the inherently stable 
sections (26), such that when the bearing element (6; 8) is  

 
fitted, it will be pressed elastically outwards with the 

result that a holding force directed radially inwards is 
produced. 
Bearing arrangement according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
4,
characterized in that
 
the bearing holder (12; 14) consists of a one-piece tubular 

insert (20) of a stator insulation component (22). 
Bearing arrangement according to Claim 5,
characterized in that
 
at least on the inside, the tubular insert (20) has a 

circumferentially closed and essentially cylindrical 
contour comprising the areas (30) forming the sections (26) 

of the mounting (10) having fixed shape, and thinner wall 
areas (32) forming the elastic sections (28). 
Bearing arrangement according to Claim 6,
characterized in that
 
the thinner wall areas (32) are formed by axial recesses 

(34) in the tubular insert (20), each positioned between 
two areas (30) of fixed shape around the circumference. 
Bearing arrangement according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
7,
characterized in that
 
the bearing holder (12; 14) has a chamfered inner 

circumferential edge (36) on the opening side of the 
mounting (10). 
Bearing arrangement according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
8,
characterized in that
 
to support and allow rotation of the rotor, two similar 

bearing elements (6; 8) are provided, each respectively 
fitted into a bearing holder (12; 14) positioned in the  

 
area of the axially opposite stator end-faces. 
Bearing arrangement according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
9,
characterized in that
 
the bearing holder (12; 14), or at least one of them (14) 

has, in at least part of the areas (30) of the tubular 
insert (20) having fixed shape, axial fastening holes (38) 

to allow attachment of the stator (2) to the flange of a 
motor. 
Bearing arrangement according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
10,
characterized in that
 
the bearing element (6; 8), or each of them, consists of a 

roller bearing with an outer ring (9) clipped force-lockingly 
into its respective bearing holder (12; 14) and 

an inner ring (15) through which the rotor shaft passes.
