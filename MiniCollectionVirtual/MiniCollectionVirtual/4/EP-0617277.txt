<ABSTRACT>
An ion-selective electrode comprises an inner solid 
state electrode (3) in a layer structure of metal/metal salt 

composed of a conductive layer (6) of a metal and a layer (7) 
of a water-insoluble salt of the metal in contact with the 

conductive layer and an ion-selective membrane (4) whose matrix 
membrane is composed of a hydrophobic polymeric material. 

The anion of the water-insoluble salt is selected from 
the group consisting of tetraphenylborate ion, derivatives of 

the tetraphenyl-borate ion, tetraalkylborate ion and derivatives 
of the tetraalkylborate ion. The electrode has a stable 

electrode performance for a prolonged time, especially a remarkable 
stability when the ion-selective membrane (4) is a 

potassium ion-selective membrane or a sodium ion-selective 

membrane and the inner solid state electrode (3) is formed by 
electrodeposition of the layer of the water-insoluble salt of 

the metal onto the surface of the metal in a solution of the 
water-insoluble salt of the metal with the anion in an organic 

solvent having a relative dielectric constant of 20 or 
more.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ion-selective 
electrode suitable for analysis of ion species 
contained in a biological fluid, and more particularly to 
an ion-selective electrode suitable for analysis of 
potassium ion, sodium ion, halide ion or carbonate ion by 
potentiometric determination. The ion-selective electrode is characterized by 
selectively determining concentrations of specific ion 
species in a solution and has been employed in various 
fields including concentration monitoring of specific ion 
species, water analysis, etc. Particularly in the 
medical field it is applied to quantitatively determine 
ion species in blood or biological solutions such as 
urine, etc., for example, chloride ions, potassium ions, 
etc. Since concentrations of specific ion species in a 
biological solution are closely related to metabolic 
reactions of living bodies, diseases for high blood 
pressure, diseases for kidney, diseases for neurosystem, 
etc. are diagnosed by determining concentrations of 
specific ion species. Between an activity a of ion species to be 
determined and an electrode potential E given by an  
 
ion-selective electrode, a correlation that the logarithm 
of activity a is proportional to a change in the 
electrode potential E is established as shown by the 
following equation:

E = E₀ + 2.303(RT/ZF) log a 


 
and the activity a of ion species to be determined can be 
simply calculated from measurements of the electrode 
potential E. In the foregoing equation, R is a gas 
constant, T an absolute temperature, Z a valency, F a 
Faraday constant, E₀ a standard potential of the system 
and log the common logarithm. With the ion selective 
electrode, concentrations of ion species existing in a 
solution can be determined in a broad concentration range 
only by measuring the electrode potential. Generally, an ion-selective electrode comprises 
an electrode body filled with an inner solution, a 
silver/silver chloride inner electrode being dipped in 
the inner solution, an ion-selective membrane being fixed 
to one open end of the electrode body. The ion-selective 
membrane is in contact with a biological fluid as a 
sample on the outside of the electrode body, while an 
aqueous electrolyte solution or an agarose gel containing 
a supporting electrolyte is used as the inner solution 
serving to conduct electricity between the ion-sensitive 
membrane and the inner electrode (Analytical Chemistry, 
Vol. 52, No. 4, pp. 692-700 (1980). An ion-selective electrode of such a type as
