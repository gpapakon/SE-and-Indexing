<ABSTRACT>
A laminate for flexible packaging and a process for 
preparing the same. The laminate for flexible packaging 

is obtained by joining a plurality of flexible blanks via 
layers of an adhesive agent, wherein the layers of said 

adhesive agent are layers of an isocyanate-terminated 
polyurethane type hot-melt resin that is cro
sslinked with 
the moisture, the residual amount of an organic solvent 

in said laminate is 10 µg/m² or smaller per a unit inner 
surface, the peeling strength at 25°C is 250 g/15 mm of 

width or greater, and a peeling strength retentivity at 
80°C is 30% or greater of the peeling strength at 25°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laminate for 
flexible packaging and a process for preparing the same. 
More specifically, the invention relates to a laminate 
for flexible packaging using a reactive hot-melt adhesive 
agent and to a process for preparing the same. Foods have been packaged not only by using rigid 
containers made up of metals, glasses and plastic 
materials but also by using flexible materials. Flexible 
packaging has an advantage in that it is light weight and 
that the packaging container after used can be easily 
disposed of. When used in the form of a laminate by sticking a 
variety of flexible blanks, the flexible packaging, 
despite of its thin film-like or sheet-like form, 
exhibits a variety of functions to a sufficient degree 
such as excellent gas barrier property, sealing 
reliability, strength and heat-sealability. In order to 
accomplish this object, there are used, in combination 
and as flexible blanks, a metal foil or a gas-barrier 
resin that imparts gas-barrier property against oxygen 
and the like, an olefin resin for imparting 
heat-sealability, and a biaxially oriented polyester film 
or a nylon film for imparting mechanical strength. The laminate can be produced by using a variety of 
means such as dry lamination, sandwich lamination, 
extrusion coating and co-extrusion. In the case of a 
packaging laminate that is to be subjected to the 
high-temperature sterilization, good results will be 
obtained when a dry lamination is employed using an  
 
urethane-type or an epoxy-type adhesive agent. Japanese Patent Publication No. 11912/1983 discloses 
an adhesive composition for a plastic-metal foil 
composite packaging material which contains a polyester 
glycol of a particular molecular weight, a 
polyesterpolyurethane polyol or a mixture thereof, a 
silane coupling agent and an organopolyisocyanate, and in 
which the equivalent ratio of an isocyanate group to 
active hydrogen lies within a predetermined range. The urethane-type adhesive agent is applied in the 
form of an organic solvent solution onto the adhesion 
surfaces of the metal foil and the plastic film. During 
the step of adhesion, however, the solvent-type adhesive 
permits the organic solvent to vaporize and contaminates 
the working environment and the air. Moreover, the 
solvent partly remains in the layer of the adhesive agent 
and deteriorates the property for retaining flavor of the 
content. A number of attempts have already been made using a 
solventless-type adhesive agent in order to solve the
