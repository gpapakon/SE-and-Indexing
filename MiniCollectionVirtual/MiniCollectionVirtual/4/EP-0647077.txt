<ABSTRACT>
In order to enable the reception of signals on a moving 
personal station PS within an IVD (Integrated Voice and Data) system 

network which comprises the available PBX and LAN, a first all station CS 
registers the LAN identifier of a first PS in accordance with the first 

PS that is present within its own radio cell, and assigns a PBX telephone 
number to the first PS. Subsequently, a calling information which 

includes a LAN identifier for a second PS and the PBX telephone number 
assigned to the first PS is broadcast via a LAN. Thereafter, a second CS 

which registers the LAN identifier of the second PS receives the calling 
information via a LAN and transfers the information of the second mobile 

station via radio link. The second PS then dials the PBX telephone 
number included in the calling information. Thus, the link between the 

first PS and the second PS is connected when the first PS receives the 
calling.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a local area network (LAN) and
communication network. More specifically, the invention relates to a
method for controlling communication in a mobile Integrated Voice and
Data (IVD) system, the system having a plurality of Cell Stations (CS's)
interconnected through communication networks including a LAN and a PBX
telephone network and Personal Stations (PS's) movable among a plurality
of radio cells, the CS having a particular radio cell which defines a
territory being capable of communicating via a radio link. In
particular, the invention relates to a "method for controlling
communication of the mobile IVD system having a plurality of PS's", the
method enabling the sending of calls to PS's and also enabling automatic
re-connection of link even when the PS moves between radio cells during
telephone calls and the link is disconnected.A PBX system is conventionally known which comprises a plurality of
PBX telephones interconnected with specifically used communication wires
the inside of buildings, schools, and enterprises (or offices in
enterprises). In addition, a recent development of radio technology has
been promoting the development of mobile IVD systems in which the PBX
telephone service is based on a physically separated form of CS's and
PS's that can communicate via radio. The system allows users
(subscribers) to actually exchange information with PS's to one another
while the CS controls the communication link among the PS's.The territory in which CS's are capable of communicating with PS's
is restricted to a predetermined area centering on the CS's owing to the
attenuation of radio waves resulting from the surrounding environment (a
territory in which PS's are communicating with each other is generally
called a radio cell). Then CS's normally accommodate within their own
radio cells one or more PS's so that assigning PBX telephone numbers of
private links to each of the PS's allows to communicate between the PS's. 
On the other hand, PS's are not mechanically constrained and may move
freely between a plurality of radio cells in accordance with the
intention of users. In addition, when mobile IVD systems are not capable
of sending and receiving some information to or from PS's via CS's, the
significance of the mobile IVD system will be decreased.However, a conventional mobile IVD system must be substituted to a
PBX added with the following functions so that the system is to be
connected with a new link so as to constantly enable reception of
information with
