<ABSTRACT>
According to the method according to the invention, the optical inspection of a transparent article (3), in particular the optical inspection of a concave container bottom, the article (3) being positioned between a radiation source (1) and an image-acquisition device (2) and an image of the article being acquired and processed, is improved in that at least one optical correction element (7.1) is interposed in the beam path between the radiation source (1) and the image-acquisition device (2), which correction element corrects the beam paths which lead to undesired dark or black points on the image such that such dark or black points are prevented or brightened, so that an image which is satisfactory for image analysis is produced.
