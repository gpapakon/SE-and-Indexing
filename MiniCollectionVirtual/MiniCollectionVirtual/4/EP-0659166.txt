<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the field of devices for pouring liquid from containers. More precisely, the invention refers to a device constituted by an inferiorly pointed tubular element (1) which is inserted into a second element (2), constituted by a collar, and into a container, in such a way that a striking surface (7) of the pointed end (4) of the tubular element (1) locks against the second element (2), gripping the container between itself and the second element (2). A nearing and distancing of the striking surface (7) to and from the second element (2) can be obtained by means of threads made on the tubular element (1) and the second element (2), or by means of a spring (9) comprised between the tubular element (1) and the second element (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
A Device for Pouring Liquids from Containers.Description.The invention relates to a device for pouring liquids from containers.For some years now there have been available on the market containers for liquids such as soft drinks, fruit juices, wine, tea and milk, made in cardboard or plasticated cardboard for foodstuffs, preferably having a parallelepiped shape. When opened, in order to pour the contents into a beaker, the user must either use a pair of scissors or tear a small triangular tab folded laterally flush to the container. This often leads to an undesired rush of liquid during the said cut or tear operation due to the movement of the container during the cutting phase, where if the container has been packed hermetically air rushes into it and inflates it.A further drawback manifests itself when the liquid is poured into a beaker since the liquid exiting from the container through the opening made manually or with scissors by the user tends 

to drip and flow unevenly, in rushes and with flowbacks. This happens especially when the container is full, where it is already difficult to pour since spillage is even more likely. To overcome the above drawbacks some types of containers have been provided with a circular weakened zone or a membrane in the superior wall of the container, into which a straw can be inserted so that the drink can be consumed directly from the container itself. This solution could not, however, be adapted for pouring purposes since the area around the weakened zone, holed for the introduction of the straw, is not tight against the straw and spillage would certainly ensue.Further, it is difficult to conserve the contents hygienically since air cannot be prevented from entering the container once it has been opened. A principal aim of the present invention is thus to obviate the above drawbacks by providing a device for pouring liquids which eliminates drips and rushes of liquid during the pouring phase, which permits of conserving the product hygienically once the container has been opened, and which is practical to use as well as being 

economical.The stated aims are fully attained by the device in object, for pouring liquids from containers, in particular for cardboard containers or plasticated cardboard containers for drinks, fruit juices, tea and wine, characterised as in the following claims.The above characteristics of the present invention will better emerge from the detailed description that follows, of an embodiment of the invention, herein illustrated purely in the

Claims .
A device for pouring liquids from containers, in particular for containers made of cardboard or plasticated cardboard, for soft drinks, fruit juices, tea and wine, characterised in that it comprises in combination: a first internally hollow tubular element (1), provided with openings (3 and 6) at an upper end and a pointed lower end (4) through which openings (3 and 6) liquid is poured from the container, the pointed end (4) being shaped in such a way as to provide a zone having a greater diameter with repect to a diameter of the overlying tubular element (1), so as to create a striking surface (7) for the tubular element (1), the tubular element (1) being destined to be introduced by means of pressing into a container at least up until it penetrates the striking surface (7) of the container; a second element (2) constituted by a collar or short pipe into which the tubular element (1) is 


introduced up until it projects inferiorly from the second element (2) with its inferior end (4) projecting beyond the striking surface (7); means for nearing and distancing the striking surface (7) and a bottom surface (12) of the second element (2), so as respectively to permit of locking the device on to the container or removing the device from the container.
A device as in claim 1, characterised in that the nearing and distancing means for between the striking surface (7) and a bottom surface of the second element (2) comprise:
- an external thread (5) covering at least a tract of the first tubular element (1);
- a corresponding partial thread internal of the second element (2), ending before the bottom surface (12) of the second element (2) in such a way as to be inferiorly provided with a sort of stop constituting an endrun stop for the screwing of the first tubular element (1).
A device as in claim 2, characterised in that the said threads have a pitch which is comprised between 6 and 12 mm., preferably between 8 and 


 10mm .
4. A device as in claim 1, characterised in that the nearing and distancing means comprise a spring (9) wound about the first tubular element (1) and operating between an internal stop (10) on the second element (2) and an external stop (11) on the tubular element (1) such as to keep the inferior part of the second element (2) pressed against the striking surface (7) associated to the bottom end (12) of the tubular element (1).
5. A device as in any of the preceding claims, characterised in that the pointed end (4) of the tubular element (1) is conical, the base of the cone having a greater diameter with respect to the overlying zone of the tubular element (1), the said conical end being provided with a plurality of holes (6) communicating with the hollow internal part of the tubular element (1).
6. A device as in any of the claims from 1 to 4, characterised in that the pointed bottom end (4) of the tubular element (1) is concial (4a) and is surmounted by a cylindrical part (4b) having a 



diameter equal to the diameter of the conical base and greater than the diameter of the zone overlying the tubular element (1), the cylindrical part (4b) being provided on a lateral surface with a plurality of holes (6) communicating with the internal hollow part of the tubular element (1).
A device as in any of the preceding claims, characterised in that the tubular element (1) is provided with a closing cap (13) of the upper opening (3) of the tubular element (1), the cap (13) being provided with a flexible element (14) for connecting it to the tubular element (1).
A device as in any of the preceding claims, characterised in that the second element (2) is superiorly provided with a drip-collection channel (15).
A device as in any of the preceding claims, characterised in that a superior part of the tubular element (1) destined to remain above the second element (2) forms an angle comprised between 90 and 180 degrees with the axis of the tubular element (1) introduced into the second 


 element ( 2 ) .
10. A device as in any of the preceding claims, characterised in that both the elements (1 and 2) composing the device are made in plastic for foodstuffs.
