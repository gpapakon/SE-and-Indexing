<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for lifting building elements, which elements are comprised of a resilient core portion (8) as well as of a surface layer (9, 9') covering it on both sides. The device is comprised of a frame structure (1), of at least one arm member (2) extending through the frame and movable relative to the frame, of a gripping member arranged at one end of the arm member and insertable under a surface layer on top of a core layer (8), of locking members arranged on the opposite end of the arm member (2) for locking the arm member (2) into a lifting position, as well as of members for supporting the frame structure (1) on a surface layer (9') opposite to the element to be lifted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and a device for lifting
building elements or corresponding panel-like members,
which members are at least partially comprised of a
core portion of a resilient material as well as of a plate-like
surface layer covering this core portion on both
side surfaces, which surface layer on at least one element
edge is bent over a part of the thickness of the
core portion.A building element, to whose lifting the inventive device
is applicable, may be comprised e.g. of a resilient core
portion made of e.g mineral wool fiber, each flat surface
of which is coated with a metal sheet glued onto the surface
of the wool plate. The treatment of such building
elements has to be gentle for preventing the damaging of
the panels, and clamp jaw type lifting devices known per
se cannot be applied to lifting these panels. Different
gripping elements have been developed for lifting said
inherently light panels, which are fixed to the flat surfaces
of the elements by suction pads.In spite of the relative lightness of the elements to be
lifted, the number of the suction pads has to be fairly
large for ensuring a sufficient lifting safety and for
taking into account the effect of factors possibly disturbing
the fixing of the suction pads. Furthermore,
these gripping elements of lifting devices require a sufficient
free space at least in the area of one surface of
the panel for fixing the gripping member to the flat surface
of the panel to be lifted.Said drawbacks may be eliminated by means of the inventive
device and method, which make the gripping on the
panel edge possible, in a certain embodiment even horizontally
in a space essentially required by the panel
thickness. The essential characteristics of the method are described
in the enclosed patent claim 1. The essential characteristics
of the device are in turn described in the enclosed
patent claim 3.The invention is illustrated by means of the accompanying
drawing, wherein
Fig. 1 shows an element to be lifted, on whose upper edge
is placed an inventive device in the initial fixing step;Fig. 2 shows the element to be lifted from the same direction,
when the inventive device is fixed to the lifting
position;Fig. 3 shows the element from the direction of the flat
surface, when the lifting device is fixed to the upper
edge in the lifting position; andFig. 4 shows an inventive application for lifting roof
elements.A panel-like building element, which is of a type that
may be lifted by means of the inventive device, is comprised
of a core portion
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for lifting a panel-like building element at
least partly comprised of a resilient core layer (8) as

well as of surface layers (9, 9') covering it on both
faces, in which element at least one of the surface layers

is extended on one edge of the element and bent over
to cover part of the corresponding edge of the core layer

(8), forming thereby a bead, 
characterized
 in that a
lifting device is used which is provided with elements

to grip from under the bead of the at least one of the
surface layers (9, 9') extending on top of the edge of the

core layer (8), and with elements to secure the gripping.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that
the core layer (8) is compressed in the planar direction

of the element for gripping under the bead of the cover
layers (9, 9').
A device for accomplishing the method of claim 1,
which device is comprised of a frame structure (1), of at

least one arm member (2) extending through the frame structure and
movable relative to said structure, of a gripping member (3)

arranged at one end of the arm member and insertable under
the bead of the at least one surface layer (9) on top

of a core layer (8), of locking members arranged on the
opposite end of the arm member (2) for locking the arm

member (2) into a lifting position, as well as of a lifting
arm (5), 
characterized
 in that the locking members
of the arm member (2) comprise a hinged member (4)

provided with a wedge member (4') for moving the arm (2)
member axially upon rotation of the hinged member, and tighten thereby

the gripping member (3) and the bead of the at least one
surface layer (9) against the frame structure (1).
A device according to claim 3, 
characterized
 in that 
the hinged member (4) is a part of the lifting arm (5)

articulated fixed to the frame (1).
A device according to claim 4, 
characterized
 in that
the lifting arm (5) is lockable to the frame (1) in a

lifting position.
A device according to any of the preceding claims 3
to 5, 
characterized
 in that the frame (1) contains members
for bearing the frame structure on an other surface

layer (9') opposite to the at least one surface layer (9)
of the element to be lifted.
A device according to claim 6, 
characterized
 in that
the members for bearing the frame structure on an other

surface layer (9') are comprised of members gripping under
the bead of said layer (9').
A device according to claim 3, 
characterized
 in that
the arm member (2) is mounted on a gap extending through

the frame structure (1) and is slidable in the gap in a
direction transverse to the lifting direction.
