<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for 
fabricating an ohmic electrode and to a multi-layered 
structure for fabricating an ohmic electrode suitable 
for, in particular, III-V compound semiconductors. Decrease in contact resistance of ohmic 
electrodes and improvement of their thermal stability 
are important issues for implementation of high 
performance and reliability of devices such as FETs 
using compound semiconductors. So far, however, no 
satisfactory ohmic electrodes are available for 
compound semiconductors, in particular, GaAs or other 
III-V compound semiconductors. At present, the most frequently used material 
of ohmic electrodes for GaAs semiconductors is AuGe/Ni. 
The use of AuGe/Ni as the material of ohmic electrodes 
makes it possible to fabricate ohmic electrodes in 
ohmic contact with GaAs semiconductors by annealing at 
400 to 500°C. The most serious problem with the use of 
AuGe/Ni as the material of ohmic electrodes is that the 
thermal instability of the ohmic electrodes fabricated 
with the material. That is, since AuGe/Ni contains a 
great amount of Au (88% of typically used AuGe), Au 
reacts with GaAs at a temperature of or above 400°C,  
 
and makes β-AuGa (of a hexagonal close packed (HCP) 
structure with melting point Tm=375°C), which causes 
deterioration of the thermal stability even though 
contributing to a decrease in contact resistance of the 
ohmic electrode. It results in inviting deterioration 
of device characteristics due to high temperature 
processes such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) 
executed after formation of the ohmic electrode. This problem is explained below by taking a 
specific JFET manufacturing process with reference to 
Fig. 1. That is, in this manufacturing process, an n-type 
channel layer 102 is first formed in a semi-insulating 
GaAs substrate 101 as shown in Fig. 1A by 
selective ion implantation of an n-type impurity and 
subsequent annealing. Then, an insulating film 103, 
such as Si₃N₄ film, is deposited on the entire surface 
of the semi-insulating GaAs substrate 101, and 
selectively removed by etching to form an opening 103a. 
After that, a p-type impurity, Zn, is diffused into the 
n-type channel layer 102 through the opening 103a to 
make a p⁺-type gate region 104. Next, as shown in Fig. 
1B, after the insulating film 103 is selectively 
removed by etching to make openings 103b, 103c, ohmic 
electrodes 105, 106, 107 are fabricated on the n-type 
channel layer 102 accessed through the openings 103a, 
103b, 103c by using AuGe/Ni as
