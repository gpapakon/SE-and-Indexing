<ABSTRACT>
A method and optical system auxiliary input calibration arrangement (10A) accurately and reliably discriminate between a user generated image and a video source generated image, such as one produced by a computer. The calibration arrangement includes amplifier devices (176a) for increasing the strength of a video information signal (178A) indicative of the video generated image, and a user generated auxiliary input signal (179A) indicative of an auxiliary input light image, without increasing spurious ambient light signals. A discrimination circuit (46A) generates a detection signal whenever the amplified information signals are greater than a predetermined reference level signal. The microprocessor (42A) controls the exposure time of the light sensing device and selects an appropriate level of amplification for the output signal from the sensing device to increase light sensitivity between the vieo source generated light images as compared to the user generated auxiliary light images. The optical auxiliary input arrangement (11B) accurately and reliably discriminates between user generated double click information without the need of the user being so steady of hand as to cause the auxiliary light information beam to illuminate the same precise location on the viewing surface during the double click operation.

This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S.
patent application filed February 14, 1991 entitled

OPTICAL COMPUTER INPUT SYSTEM," and a continuation-in-part
application of U.S. patent application Serial

INPUT SYSTEM," both of which are continuation-in-part
applications of U.S. patent application Serial
No. 07/433,029 filed November 7, 1989, entitled "COMPUTER
INPUT SYSTEM AND METHOD OF USING SAME," now abandoned.This invention relates to the general field of an
optical input arrangement and a method of using such an
arrangement. More particularly, the present invention
relates to an optical calibration technique for use with
an optical system auxiliary input for facilitating
accurate communication of user generated optical
information utilized for display purposes. The present
invention also relates to an auxiliary optical computer
input system to facilitate recognition of an auxiliary
optical input in a more precise and accurate manner. The
present invention further relates to an optical auxiliary
input technique for a system, which projects a computer
generated image onto a viewing surface. In one type of optical information system computer
generated images are projected onto a screen for viewing
by a large number of people simultaneously. An important
aspect of such a system is to enable a user to enter
information interactively into the system to modify
images, or generate additional images during
presentation.In one successful arrangement, a user points a light
generating device, such as a flashlight or laser pointer,
at a projected image to provide auxiliary information for
the system. In this regard, such a system generally
includes a video information source, such as a computer,
and a display projection arrangement, such as an overhead
projector, for projecting images of the video information
onto a viewing surface. An image processing arrangement
detects and processes the displayed image reflecting from
the viewing surface. Such a system detects the high
intensity light images produced by the hand-held light
generating device, and discriminates them from background
ambient light as well as the

so that said sensing means (34C) and said light source (40C, 44C) can be

moved adjustably by employing said mounting means until the alignment
image (46C) is positioned generally at a central portion of the viewing area

(25C); whereby said light sensing means (34C) is properly aligned with the
viewing area (25C) to sense optically the entire projected image (24C).
The method of claim 1 further characterized by: a method
(70AC, 80AC) of using an auxiliary optical command arrangement (10C,

26C) for controlling a liquid crystal display system for projection an image
(24C) onto a surface (22C), characterized by:

   receiving (34C, 70AC, 80C) incoming light indicative of a reflected
projected image, a reflected auxiliary command image (24C) having a

narrow band of optical wavelengths, and extraneous light including reflected
and direct ambient light of different intensities and optical wavelengths;

directing an auxiliary light command image (27C) having a narrow
wavelength band onto the surface (22C) and the projected image (24C)

thereon to help discriminate the command image (27C) from all other light;
optically filtering (36C) the incoming light being received to pass only said

narrow band of optical wavelengths to facilitate the detection of said
auxiliary command image (27C); generating (30C, 50C) an electrical output

signal indicative of light only having wavelengths substantially within said
narrow band of optical wavelengths; detecting (50C) when an intensity

value exceeds a positive threshold amount and substantially immediately
thereafter decreases more than a negative threshold amount to discriminate 

against reflected projected image light and extraneous light so that only
auxiliary light command images (27C) can be detected.
The method of claim 19, further characterized by:

   determining a black level reference level to help generate a modified
electrical signal indicative of the received light having said narrow band of

wavelengths and a peak intensity level substantially equal to the
combination of the lowest intensity level of the reflected projected image

from the surface and the highest intensity level of the command image
reflecting from the surface; determining a peak video image reference level,

and a peak control image reference level; establishing a reference level
between said peak video image reference level and said peak control image

reference level; generating (58C) a control signal indicative of a desired
modification of the projected image whenever the electrical signal is greater

than said reference level, said electrical signal being further indicative of
visible light in said narrow band of wavelengths and having a peak intensity

level that is at least grater than the highest intensity level the projected
image reflecting from the viewing surface; and modifying the projected

image (24C) in response to said control signal.
The method of claim 19, further having a calibration method
for the liquid crystal display system, characterized by:

   using the display system to project a calibration video image onto the
surface; detecting a predetermined narrow band of optical wavelengths of

light reflected from the surface; determining the value of the maximum
video intensity of the reflected wavelengths of light; storing the maximum

intensity value thereof; establishing a reference level value at a level
substantially greater than the stored maximum intensity value and

substantially less than the combination of the value of the maximum video
intensity and a maximum value of control light directed onto and reflecting

from the video image; said maximum video intensity value being the
maximum intensity level value of only that portion of light reflecting from 

the surface indicative of a projected video image having wavelengths in only
a narrow band range; said maximum control light value being the

combination of the minimum intensity level value of only that portion of
light reflecting from said surf
ace indicative of said projected video image
having wavelengths in only the narrow band range and the maximum control

light intensity value having wavelengths in only said narrow band range,
where the control light is reflecting from the last mentioned portion of said

projected video image; and generating (58C) a control signal whenever the
value of said detection signal is greater than said reference level value, said

control signal indicative of at least a detected video image coordinate
location for helping to control the display.
The method of claim 19 further characterized by:

   using optical sensing means (34C); sensing optically (34C) a
projected image (24C), said image (24C) having an associated viewing area

(25C) on the surface (22C) to generate electrical command signals for
controlling the display system; using a light source (40C, 44C) for

producing an alignment image (46C); projecting said alignment image (46C)
onto the viewing area (25C) to facilitate adjustment of said optical sensing

means (34C) to an aligned position; activating said light source (40C, 44C)
to project the alignment image (46C) generally toward the viewing area

(22C) so that said sensing means (34C) and said light source (46C) can be
moved adjustably until the alignment image is positioned generally at a

central portion of the viewing area (22C); whereby said optical sensing
means (34C) is properly aligned with the viewing area (22C) to sense

optically the entire projected image (24C).
