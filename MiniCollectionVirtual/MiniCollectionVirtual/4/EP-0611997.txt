<ABSTRACT>
A photopolymerizable composition containing an addition-polymerizable compound having at least one ethylenically unsaturated 
double bond, a free-radical generator and a squarylium compound represented by general formula (I). The composition 

is highly sensitive to visible and near-infrared rays, in particular, a He-Ne laser, a light-emitting diode and a semiconductor laser, 
each having an oscillation wavelength in the range of over 600 nm, thus being useful as the material of hologram, presensitized 

plate for laser direct plate-making, dry film resist, digital proof, photosensitive microcapsule, and so forth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to photopolymerizable
compositions, particularly photopolymerizable compositions
having a high sensitivity to visible and near infrared light
at a wavelength of 600 nm or more.There has been known a photopolymerizable
composition comprising an addition-polymerizable compound
having at least one ethylenically unsaturated double bond; a
squarylium compound represented by the formula:

wherein Ra and Rb each are a substituted or unsubstituted
aminophenyl group or a group Y=CH- where Y is a nitrogen-containing
heterocyclic group; and an s-triazine compound
having at least one halogenated methyl group [Japanese 
Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 306247/90
(EP379200A)].Further, a squarylium compound represented by the
formula:

wherein, R1a and R2a may be the same or different, and each
represent a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, a substituted or
unsubstituted aryl group or a substituted or unsubstituted
aralkyl group; n represents an integer of 0 to 4; R3a may be
the same or different, and represents a halogen atom, an alkyl
group, an alkoxy group, a nitro group or a hydroxy group; p
represents an integer of 0 to 5; R4a may be the same or
different, and represents a halogen atom, an alkyl group, an
alkoxy group, a hydroxy group, a nitro group, a cyano group,
a trifluoromethyl group or a

R5a and R6a
may be the same or different, and each represent an alkyl
group; R7a represents an alkyl group, a substituted or
unsubstituted aryl group or a substituted or unsubstituted
aralkyl group; q represents an integer of 0 to 4; R8a may be 
the same or different, and represents a halogen atom, an alkyl
group, an alkoxy group, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl or
a substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl group or two
neighboring R8a's may be joined together to form an aromatic
ring optionally having (a) substituent(s); and R9a and R10a
have the same meanings as R1a has been disclosed (Japanese Published Unexamined
Patent Application No. 149263/91). There have been filed
applications for squarylium compounds represented by the
formula:

where R1b and R2b may be the same or different and represent
an alkyl group, or R1b and R2b may be joined together to form
a hydrocarbon ring; R3b represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl
group or an aryl group; m represents an integer of 0 to 4; R4b
may be the same or different, and represents a halogen atom,
an alkyl group, an aralkyl group, an aryl group or an alkoxy
group or two neighboring R4b's may be joined together to form
an aromatic ring
