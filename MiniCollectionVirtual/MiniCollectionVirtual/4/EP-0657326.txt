<ABSTRACT>
To release a roll-over bar in the event of a crash, the use of a pyrotechnical fuse composition (15) is proposed. The said fuse composition (15) can be used both as a drive for the extension and for the pivot movement, in that a piston (12) is displaced by the expansion of gas, causing the roll-over bar to be driven. The use of complete pyrotechnical cartridges which eject and/or draw in pins makes it possible to replace crash magnets while leaving the design of the roll-over bar otherwise unchanged.

<CLAIMS>
A roll bar for a motor vehicle, which can be brought into an extended or swivelled-out
end position by at least one pre-loaded compression spring (28) at least when there is a danger

of the vehicle's overturning, 
characterised in that
 the extending or swivelling-out movement
is triggered, when there is a danger of overturning, by releasing the compression spring (28)

by means of a pyrotechnic ignition composition (33).
A roll bar according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the pyrotechnic ignition
composition (33) is arranged in or at a substantially cylindrical chamber (26, 30) which is

delimited at one end by an axially displaceable piston (34) connected to a pin (27) which is in
operative connection with a locking device (27, 12; 27, 29; 31, 32) which, in normal

circumstances, that is to say, in the absence of a danger of overturning, holds the roll bar in a
retracted end position with the compression spring (28) pre-loaded.
A roll bar according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
, in normal circumstances, the
pin (27) is itself in operative engagement with a part (piston 12, member 29) of the roll bar,

and the ignition composition (33) is so arranged in the chamber (26) in relation to the piston
(34) that, when there is a danger of overturning, the pin (27) is retracted, releasing the

operative connection.
A roll bar according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
, in normal circumstances, a
pivoted locking lever (31) is in operative engagement with a part (member 32) of the roll bar,

and the ignition composition (33) is so arranged in the chamber (30) in relation to the piston
(34) that, when there is a danger of overturning, the pin (27) is ejected, swivelling the locking

lever (31) and undoing the operative connection.
