<ABSTRACT>
To reduce the required diffusion depth of impurities in 
manufacturing a protective diode for protecting an insulated gate 

transistor from overvoltage so that the diode can be easily built in 
a chip of the transistor, a plurality of p-type diode layers (32) are 

built in by diffusion through the windows in an insulation film (31) 
disposed on an n-type region (2) into which a depletion layers spread 

when the vertical field effect transistor to be protected is turned 
off, and a diode terminal (A) is led out from an electrode film (34) 

that is in electrical contact with the diode layers (32). This 
configuration prevents depletion layers, spreading from the diode 

layers (32) into the semiconductor region (2) by the applied 
overvoltage, from joining with each other, and sufficiently lowers 

the breakdown voltage of the protective diode (30) with respect to 
the withstand voltage of the transistor (10 or 20) even when the 

diffusion depth of the diode layer (32) is one order of magnitude 
shallower than in the prior art.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a diode built in a chip of a
transistor for protecting the transistor from overvoltage, and in
particular to a protective diode suitable for an insulated gate transistor
such as a field-effect transistor (hereinafter referred to as "FET") or an
insulated gate bipolar transistor (hereinafter referred to as "IGBT").When overvoltage is applied to a transistor from the load side
and a breakdown occurs between the main terminals of the transistor, while
it is driving a load for example, the transistor may be damaged or
destroyed by an excessive avalanche current that flows through the
transistor during the breakdown period. To avoid this, a diode that
breaks down prior to breakdown of the transistor when overvoltage is
applied is often connected to the transistor. A conventional method of
protecting the transistor from such overvoltage is now described, with
reference to Figure 3 of the accompanying drawings, according to a prior
art dynamic clamping protection method suitable for an insulated gate
transistor.In Figure 3(a), an FET 10 is to be protected from overvoltage. A
protective diode 30 is connected between a drain and a gate terminal G in
reverse polarity to a supplementary diode 50. The protective diode 30
breaks down, for example, by overvoltage applied from the load side when a
source terminal S side is wounded (earthed) and a load is connected to a
drain source D. When the FET 10 is turned off and the overvoltage caused
by the induction or the like on the load side reaches the breakdown
voltage of the protective diode 30 (which is lower than the breakdown
voltage value of the FET 10), the protective diode 30 becomes conductive
to increase the gate voltage of the n-channel FET 10, which then remains
in the "ON" state. Consequently, the overvoltage is clamped at the
breakdown voltage of the protective diode 30. When the transient
overvoltage decreases, the protective diode 30 returns to a non-breakdown
state to turn off the FET 10. The supplementary diode 50 is used to
prevent the protective diode 30 from becoming conductive by positive gate
voltage when the FET 10 is turned on. In Figure 3(b), an IGBT 20 is to be protected. In this case, the
protective diode 30 is connected between the base of the IGBT 20 and the
gate terminal G without using the supplementary diode 50 seen in Figure
3(a). When, for example, overvoltage is applied to a collector terminal
C, connected to a load, of the "OFF" state IGBT 20 the emitter terminal of
which is wounded, the protective diode
