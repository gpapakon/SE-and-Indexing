mixture of at least one
 high melting point refractory and 
ion sintered durable substance selected from a group 

consisting of a metal having melting point equal to or 
higher than 2400°C, an alloy containing the metal as a 

main constituent thereof, a carbide of the metal, a boride 
of the metal, zirconium carbide and zirconium boride and 

at least one electron emissive substance having low work 
function, selected from borides or oxides of a metal 

selected from a group consisting of lanthanum, yttrium, 
cerium and cesium, said sintered mixture being prepared

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electron beam apparatus for
melting, bonding, drilling and annealing metal material,
etc., to be machined by irradiating the material with
electron beam in vacuum pressure in which an effect of
ion sputtering is considerable under low vacuum pressure,
which electron beam apparatus
uses a thermoionic emissive cathode.A conventional thermoionic emissive cathode for
electron beam irradiation is usually made of oxide,
lanthanum boride or high melting point metal, etc.
For example, as disclosed in the Japanese Institute
of Electrical Engineers, Technical Report (Section II)
No. 147, pages 1 to 42 (Edited by the Japanese Institute
of Electrical Engineers Corporation, April, 1983), a 
thermoionic emissive cathode in an electron beam apparatus
for melting, bonding, drilling and annealing metal material,
etc., is made of a high melting point metal such as
tungsten or tantalum, or lanthanum boride.It has been known, however, that such high melting
point metal has a large work function. Therefore, when
such high melting point metal is to be used as the
thermoionic emissive cathode material, it is necessary to
heat the high melting point metal to very high temperature.
For example, when tungsten is used as a material of a
thermoionic emissive cathode of direct heating type, it
is necessary to heat it to a temperature as high as 2500
to 2600°C. Therefore, in order to make direct heating
easier, the thermoionic emissive cathode has been made
from a thin tungsten wire shaped to a hair-pin or from
a thin tungsten tape shaped to a ribbon. Alternatively,
a thermoionic emissive cathode has been constituted with
a tungsten rod and a tungsten filament coil arranged around
the rod and the tungsten rod has been heated by electrons
emitted from the tungsten coil.In the direct heating method, however, tungsten
material of the thermoionic emissive cathode in the form
of filament or thin strip is consumed at a relatively high
speed by evaporation thereof during its use. Further, the
thermoionic emissive cathode of tungsten is locally drilled
within relatively short time by ion sputtering of metal 
vapor. etc., coming from a material to be machined thereby
during irradiation of the latter with electron beam. As
a result, it has been necessary to replace the tungsten
thermoionic emissive cathode frequently.In the method of heating the rod type thermoionic
emissive cathode of tungsten by electrons from the
surrounding tungsten coil, on the other hand, there is a
problem that the structure of the
