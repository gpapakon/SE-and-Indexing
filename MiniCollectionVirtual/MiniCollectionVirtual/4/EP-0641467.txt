<ABSTRACT>
A timing and control system for a glassware forming machine includes a shop computer system (20) resident within a control room and a hot end console (35) on the shop floor adjacent a multi-section glassware forming machine (10). The shop computer system executes a number of subroutines which permit configuration of the shop and of each IS machine section (10a-10f), such as routines for identifying on and off angles for the several mechanical devices associated with the sections. The shop computer system implements subroutines which test for and detect potential conflicts or collisions between machine devices due to changes in the event times for the devices. Timing and sequence functions of the system are implemented using a link table (100) associated with the on and off angles of two sub-events for each mechanical device. Linkable records (107-110) are linked to storage locations in the link tables corresponding to 0.1 degree increments in the shop or machine cycle.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTRONIC CONTROLLER FOR A GLASSWARE FORMING MACHINEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention concerns a computer-based system for synchronizing and controlling the operations of a glassware forming machine. The glassware forming machine includes a number of individual sections which receive molten glass from a furnace or forehearth to be molded into a particular glassware article. The article or ware is passed by way of a transfer conveyor to a lehr for annealing the glass. The present invention thus contemplates a computer-based system for scheduling the operation of each section and its mechanical components, and for providing access by the machine operator to modify the glassware forming sequence and timing of events.A typical glassware forming machine includes a plurality of sections which are each capable of manufacturing glassware by itself. The sections are operated in synchronism according to a particular phase relationship between each section in order to permit the plurality of sections to obtain gobs of molten glass from a single source in an ordered sequence. Each section then forms these acquired gobs of molten glass into a number of finished glassware articles which are then delivered to an output conveyor, again in synchronized fashion. While one section is delivering glassware to the conveyor, another section may be engaged in a different step in the formation of the glassware article. When properly timed and phased, wholly formed glassware articles are produced by each section and passed in an orderly fashion onto the conveyor which transports the glassware articles to a stacker, and ultimately to a lehr for annealing. 

 The glassware forming machine, and each section includes a number of functional components or mechanical devices which perform each of the steps in the glassware forming operation. For instance, the machine includes a feeder for acquiring molten glass from the forehearth and passing the molten glass to a gob distributor. A shear cuts the molten glass into measured gobs. The gob distributor includes a number of scoops which are used to convey the measured gobs to one of the number of sections associated with the gob distributor. Separate motors are used to drive the feeder, shear and gob distributor.Each section also includes a number of mechanical devices which can be pneumatically, hydraulically or electrically controlled. For instance, each section receives the molten glass and includes a component for molding the glass, or blowing the glass, into a
