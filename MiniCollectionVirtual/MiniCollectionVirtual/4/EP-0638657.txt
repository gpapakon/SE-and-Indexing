<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a powder forging 
method for producing aluminum (Aℓ) alloy powder of high 
proof stress and toughness that can be applied to 
components such as engine components of cars in which 
toughness is required. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to a powder forging method for producing 
an aluminum alloy superior in dynamic strength. 
Description of the Background Art From the US-A-4,435,213, a method for compacting an aluminum 
alloy powder and shaping the same into a useful article including 
heating the compact rapidly by induction heating 
techniques is known. The maximum heating rate is 45°C/min, 
and the forging is performed at 260 - 454°C.  
 A method of powder forging by subjecting an amorphous 
phase to a heat treatment is proposed in Japanese Patent 
Application No. 4-77650 (filed March 31, 1992) (Japanese 
Patent Laying-Open No. 5-279767) by the inventors of the 
present application. A method of heating atomized powder of Aℓ-Fe-Y type 
to obtain aluminum in a nano structure (a structure of 
grains or precipitates in nm unit) is disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2-274834. Atomized powder of Aℓ-Fe-Si-X type (at least one of 
X=Ti, Co, Ni, Mn, and Cr) is proposed in Japanese Patent 
Application No. 4-113712 (filed May 6, 1992) (U.S. Patent  
 
No. 5,312,494) by the inventors of the present 
application. The above-mentioned Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 
4-77650 proposing a powder forging method provides only 
the description of "at least the glass transition 
temperature (approximately 250-300°C in general) for the 
forging temperature. The highest temperature described in 
the embodiment thereof is 550°C. The inventors of the 
present application carried out various experiments 
according to this description, and found out that, by a 
heating process up to the temperature of 550°C, favorable 
values can be obtained for static strength by a tensile 
test or the like, but not for dynamic strength such as the 
Charpy impact values. The alloy disclosed in the above-mentioned Japanese 
Patent Laying-Open No. 2-274834 and Japanese Patent 
Application No. 4-113712 is noteworthy of having superior 
static strength and dynamic strength. However, this 
strength has been assessed only for an alloy that is 
solidified by extrusion. The inventors of the present 
application have found out that the static strength is 
superior but the dynamic strength is not sufficient when 
this alloy is powder-forged at the general heating 
temperature of 450-550°C. A
