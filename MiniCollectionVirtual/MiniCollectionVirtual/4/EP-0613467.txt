<DESCRIPTION>
 2-PYRIDIN0L DERIVATIVES AND THEIR USE AS MEDICAMENTS.The present invention relates to pyridinol derivatives, processes for their preparation, intermediates in their preparation, their use as medicaments and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising them.The compounds of this invention are agonists of a cyclic AMP- dependent protein kinase (cA-PrK) (see J. Biol. Chem., 1989, 264, 8443 - 8446) and are of use in combatting such conditions where such agonism is thought to be beneficial. They are likely to have anti-proliferative, anti-aggregatory, cholesterol-lowering, smooth muscle relaxant, positive lusitropic, anti-allergic or anti-inflammatory activities. They are likely to be useful in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases where there is a component of diastolic failure, cancer, psoriasis, atheroschlerosis, thrombosis, re-stenosis, chronic reversible lung disease such as asthma and bronchitis, allergic disease such as allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis and urticaria or gut motility disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome.Accordingly the present invention provides compounds of the formula (1) :or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, whereinR0 is OH or a bioprecursor thereof, 

 R1 is A°Cθ2H, P(Z) (OH) (OR2) , SO2H or SO3H or a bioprecursor thereof,A0 is CH2, CHF, CF2, CR3(OR4) , CO or C(OR5) (OR6),R2 is phenyl, C3_5cycloalkyl, C3_5cycloalkylC _ alkyl, or Ci-gal yl optionally substituted by Cχ_4alkoxy,R3 is H, methyl or ethyl,R4 is H or Cχ_3alkyl,R^ and R6 are each Cχ_3alkyl or together form a 1,2- ethanediyl group or 1,3-propanediyl group,Z is 0 or S, andAr is phenyl optionally substituted by one to three groups independently selected from Cx-galkyl, C2-galkenyl, Cχ_galkoxy, C^-galkenyloxy, C3_gcycloalkyl, C3_gcycloalkoxy, Ci-galkylthio, phenyl, phenylthio, benzyloxy, Cι_gpolyfluoroalkylr* C _gpolyfluoroalkoxy, halo, N(R7)2 or NHCOR7 wherein R7 is H or Cχ_galkyl, or -X(CH2)nY- attached to adjacent carbon atoms of the phenyl ring wherein X and Y are independently CH2 or 0 and n is 1 to 3, wherein said Cχ_galkyl, C2-galkenyl or Cχ_galkoxy groups can be independently substituted by OH, Cx-galkoxy, C3_gc cloalkyl, N(R7)2, C02R7 or CON(R7)2.Bioprecursors of the groups R^ and R1 are derivatives thereof which are convertible in vivo into the groups ^ and R1.A suitable bioprecursor of the group R^ is OR5 wherein R^ is C _ al yl, arylCχ_4alkyl (for example phenylCχ_4alkyl such as benzyl) , Cχ_4alkanoyl (for example acetyl) , arylCχ_4alkanoyl (for example phenyl Cχ_4alkanoyl such as benzoyl) ,
