<ABSTRACT>
The device (3,4) for the flexographic-type printing of sheets of a semi-rigid material, of the corrugated cardboard type, includes:   - a plate-carrying cylinder (30, 40) to the periphery of which is fixed a plate (31, 41) of thickness Ec, - a counterpressure system, which is possibly a counterpressure cylinder (35, 45),   - an engraved cylinder (33, 43), - and a transfer system (36, 46) to the entrance of which the sheets (1a) are fed one by one.   Characteristically, it furthermore comprises:   a) three or four motors which are mechanically independent and which drive round respectively the plate-carrying cylinder (30, 40) in the case of the first, the engraved cylinder (33, 43) in the case of the second, the transfer system (36, 46) in the case of the third, and possibly the counterpressure cylinder (35, 45) in the case of the fourth, b) and an electronic circuit (7) which is connected to the second, third and possibly fourth motors, which receives as input a reference signal (6) and which comprises means for entering the operating parameters, including at least the thickness Ec of the plate (31, 41) and the printing speed. The electronic circuit (7) is programmed to control the rotation of the said motors automatically as a function of the thickness Ec and of the printing speed, so as to obtain optimal printing.

peripheral linear speed of the backing cylinder (35, 45) are equal to the linear

controlling the rotation of the first motor in such a manner as to bring the plate-carrier 
cylinder (30, 40) into an initial angular position that depends on a 

predefined setting parameter.
