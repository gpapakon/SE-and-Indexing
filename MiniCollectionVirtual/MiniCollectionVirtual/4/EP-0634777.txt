<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an electrode assembly useful in confined 
plasma assisted chemical etching and, in particular, relates to one such electrode assembly 
having means for providing a D.C. bias voltage to the electrode. As used herein the phrase "confined plasma" is taken to mean a plasma discharge 
that is laterally bounded such that the spatial footprint of the plasma can be controlled. A general theory of the physical factors involved in the plasma assisted chemical 
etching process is provided in the article entitled A Theory of Plasma-Assisted Chemical 
Vapor Transport Processes; by C. B. Zarowin in the Journal of Applied Physics, 57 (3), 
1 February 1985. Therein a set of mathematical equations are developed that describe the 
factors involved in the flow of the plasma. Among other factors discussed therein is the 
effect of the external application of, or self-induced, dc bias are discussed as having 
effects similar to that of temperature differences in that both superpose algebraically in 
the transport rate. Recently, the use of plasma assisted chemical etching has been applied to both the 
thinning and flattening of semiconductor wafers. In such applications a confined plasma 
is established between a relatively small area electrode, or puck, and a larger electrode. 
The semiconductor wafer is disposed between the puck and the larger electrode and is 
then thinned or flattened by creating relative motion between the semiconductor wafer and 
the puck in accordance with a predetermined dwell time map. In order to achieve a 
highly accurate process, the plasma discharge is confined so that the operating plasma 
etching footprint is smaller than the smallest surface variation to be etched. As well known in the semiconductor wafer processing art, it is extremely 
important at each step of the semiconductor wafer processing to avoid the contamination 
of the semiconductor wafer surface. A typical semiconductor industry surface cleanliness 
specification is less than 2 particles greater than 0.1 micrometer in diameter over the 
entire surface of a wafer. Hence, considerable time and expense are used to ensure that 
the surface of the semiconductor wafer is as free of particulates as possible.  Presently, electrode assemblies include an electrode formed from a porous 
electrically conductive material and disposed at one end of an electrode holder. An 
electrically insulating chimney is disposed such that the electrode extends partially 
through a clearance opening in the
