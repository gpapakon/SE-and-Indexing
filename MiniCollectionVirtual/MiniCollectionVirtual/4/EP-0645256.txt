<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a printing machine having a roller platten (3) and a print head (4) which is assigned thereto and has a support (5) and a spring base (6), at least the spring base (6) being rotatably mounted on a bearing pin (2) which is preferably parallel to the roller platten (3). To improve the mounting of the print head (4), it is recommended that the free end of the bearing pin (2) be flattened over a partial length to form two parallel key surfaces (13,14), and that an interlock member (12) which is retained in its interlock position on the spring base (6) have a keyhole-type opening (18) whose circular part (21) has a diameter corresponding approximately to the diameter of the free end of the bearing pin (2), whereas the width of the narrow opening part (22) corresponds approximately to the spacing of the key surfaces (13,14).
