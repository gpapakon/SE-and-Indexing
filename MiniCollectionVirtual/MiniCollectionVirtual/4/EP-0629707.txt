<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for softening an aqueous sugar (sugar cane) juice containing sugars and Ca
<
2+
>
 and/or Mg
<
2+
>
 ions, such as a sugar refinery molasses, by means of a cation-exchange resin, in the Na
<
+
>
 and/or K
<
+
>
 form, and for regenerating the said resin, which comprises:   (a) a softening stage consisting in bringing the said sugar juice into contact with the said cation-exchange resin, in the Na
<
+
>
 and/or K
<
+
>
 form, in order to obtain, on the one hand, a softened sugar juice depleted in Ca
<
2+
>
 and/or Mg
<
2+
>
 ions and loaded with Na
<
+
>
 and/or K
<
+
>
 ions and, on the other hand, a cation-exchange resin loaded with Ca
<
2+
>
 and/or Mg
<
2+
>
 ions, and   (b) a stage for regeneration of the latter resin, characterised in that the regeneration stage (b) consists in bringing the said resin into contact with a liquid effluent produced during the separation by chromatography of the sugars of a softened aqueous sugar juice containing sugars and Na
<
+
>
 and/or K
<
+
>
 ions, this liquid effluent containing the greater part of the Na
<

 and/or K
<

A process for softening an aqueous sugar juice
containing sugars and Ca
2+
 and/or Mg
2+
 ions, such as a
sugar factory molasses by means of a cation exchange

resin, and for regeneration of said resin, comprising:

(a) a softening step wherein the said sugar juice is
brought into contact with the said cation exchange

resin, in the form Na
+
 and/or K
+
, to give, on the
one hand, a softened sugar juice depleted in Ca
2+

and/or Mg
2+
 ions and charged with Na
+
 and/or K
+

ions and, on the other hand, a cation exchange
resin charged with Ca
2+
 and/or Mg
2+
 ions, and
(b) a step for the regeneration of said latter resin,

characterised in that the regeneration step (b)
comprises bringing the said resin into contact with a

liquid effluent produced on separation by
chromatography of the sugars from a softened aqueous

sugar juice containing sugars and Na
+
 and/or K
+
 ions,
said liquid effluent containing the majority of the Na
+

and/or K
+
ions initially present in the softened sugar
juice.
A process according to claim 1, characterised in
that the liquid effluent used in step (b) is the

effluent produced on separation by chromatography of
the sugars from the softened sugar juice obtained in step

(a). 
A process according to claim 1, characterised in
that the liquid effluent is concentrated before being

used in step (b).
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that before the said resin is brought

into contact with the said liquid effluent in step (b),
Na
+
 and/or K
+
 ions are added to the said liquid
effluent.
A process according to claim 1, 2, 3 or 4,
characterised in that the cation exchange resin used in

step (a) is a strong cation resin in the form Na
+

and/or K
+
 and in that the chromatography producing the
liquid effluent used in step (b) is carried out on a

strong cation resin in the form Na
+
 and/or K
+
 with
elution with water.
A process for the recovery of the sugars contained
in an aqueous sugar juice containing essentially

sugars, Ca
2+
 and/or Mg
2+
 ions, and colouring agents,
such as a sugar factory molasses, comprising:


(i) a softening step wherein the said aqueous sugar juice is
brought into contact with a cation exchange resin,

hand, a softened sugar juice depleted in Ca
2+
