<ABSTRACT>
A piezoelectric/electrostrictive actuator including a 
ceramic substrate (64) and piezoelectric/electrostrictive 

elements (70) is disclosed. The ceramic substrate includes: 
a spacer plate (62) having a plurality of windows (68) 

formed in a row in the longitudinal direction of the spacer 
plate, and auxiliary windows (78) formed adjacent to 

respective two outermost windows (68) which are located at 
the opposite ends of the row of the plurality of windows, 

such that the auxiliary windows sandwich the row of the 
plurality of windows; and a closure plate (56) superposed on 

one of opposite major surfaces of the spacer plate, so that 
the plurality of windows and the auxiliary windows of the 

spacer plate are closed by the closure plate to provide 
pressure chambers (36) and enclosed spaces, respectively, 

within the substrate. The spacer plate and the closure plate 
are formed from respective ceramic green sheets which are 

laminated on each other and fired into an integral structure 
as the ceramic substrate. The piezoelectric/electrostrictive 

elements (70) are disposed on respective portions of the 
closure plate (56) which partially define the pressure 

chambers (36), respectively, but are not disposed on 
respective portions of the closure plate (56) which  

 
partially define the enclosed spaces corresponding to the 

auxiliary windows (78).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a 
piezoelectric/electrostrictive actuator, and more 
particularly to a uni-morph, bi-morph or other types of 
piezoelectric/electrostrictive actuator or actuator unit 
which undergoes displacement in the form of bending, 
deflection or flexure and which can be used for ink jet 
print heads, microphones, sounding bodies (such as 
loudspeakers), various resonators and vibrators, and other 
components or devices. As a means for raising a pressure in a pressure 
chamber formed within a substrate of an actuator unit, there 
is recently known a piezoelectric/electrostrictive element 
formed on a wall partially defining the pressure chamber, 
for changing a volume of the pressure chamber due to 
displacement of the piezoelectric/electrostrictive element. 
Such a piezoelectric or electrostrictive actuator unit may 
be used for each of a plurality of ink pumps of a print head 
used in an ink jet printer, for example. To effect printing 
by the print head, an ink material is supplied to the 
pressure chamber to fill the same, and the level of ink  
 
pressure within the pressure chamber is raised due to 
displacement of the piezoelectric/electrostrictive element, 
so that a crowd of the ink particles (a droplet of the ink) 
is jetted through a nozzle which communicates with the 
pressure chamber. Referring to Figs. 5 and 6, there is illustrated 
one of the actuator units used in an ink jet print head, 
wherein the reference numeral 25 denotes an actuator portion 
which includes a substrate 24 consisting of a closure plate 
18 and a spacer plate 20 both made of a metal, synthetic 
resin or ceramic material, and a plurality of 
piezoelectric/electrostrictive elements 28 formed on an 
outer surface of the closure plate 18 of the substrate 24. 
The spacer plate 20 has an array of windows 22 (three 
windows in this example) formed through its thickness. The 
spacer plate 20 and the closure plate 18 are superposed on 
each other and formed integrally into the substrate 24, so 
that one of opposite openings of each window 22 is closed by 
the closure plate 18, to thereby provide, within the 
substrate 24, a plurality of pressure chambers 26 which 
correspond to the respective windows 22. The 
piezoelectric/electrostrictive elements 28 are secured to 
the outer surface of the closure plate 18 of the substrate 
24 such that the piezoelectric/electrostrictive elements 28 
are aligned with the respective pressure chambers 26. In 
operation, the piezoelectric/electrostrictive
