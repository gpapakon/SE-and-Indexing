<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pressure medium-operated brake device for rail vehicle formations with a main air line (according to UIC standard 540), by way of which both the pressure medium reservoirs for individual vehicles are filled and the pneumatic brake signals are transmitted, a control valve device being arranged on each individual vehicle, which in the event of a pressure drop in the main air line causes a delivery of pressure medium proportional to the size of the pressure drop, from the reservoir to the brake cylinder. According to the invention each control valve device (1) has a proportional control valve function and in addition electronic and/or electro-mechanical means (5, 6, 7, ..., 10, ..., 20, 21), by means of which the pressure drop in the main air line (HL) can be measured, and an electrical actuating signal (Sb) can be generated for the delivery of pressure medium to the brake cylinder (3).

A braking means for rail vehicle sets which is 
operated by pressure medium, having a main air line 

(HL) via which both the pressure medium reservoirs (2) 
relating to individual vehicles are filled and the 

pneumatic braking signal transmission is effected, with 
a control valve means (1) being provided on each 

individual vehicle which in the event of a pressure 
loss in the main air line (HL) effects controlled 

supply of the pressure medium from the reservoir (2) to 
the brake cylinder (3) which is proportional to the 

amount of the pressure loss, characterised in that the 
control valve means (1) has in each case a proportional 

valve function and furthermore electronic and/or 
electromechanical means (5, 6, 7, ..., 10, ... 20, 21) 

via which the pressure loss in the main air line (HL) 
can be measured and an electric driving signal (Sb) can 

be generated for controlled supply of the pressure 
medium to the brake cylinder (3). 
A braking means for rail vehicle sets according to 
Claim 1, characterised in that two pressure/voltage 

converters (20, 21) are provided, the first pressure/voltage 
converter (20) effecting the measurement of the 

pressure in the main air line (HL), and the second 
pressure/voltage converter (21) effecting the 

measurement of the pressure in the pressure medium 
reservoir (2). 
A braking means for rail vehicle sets which is 
operated by pressure medium according to Claim 2, 

characterised in that the valve for controlled supply 
of the pressure medium to the brake cylinder (3) is a 

proportional valve (5).  
 
A braking means for rail vehicle sets which is 
operated by pressure medium, having a main air line 

(HL) via which both the supply of pressure medium and 
the pneumatic braking signal transmission is effected, 

with a control valve means (1) being provided on each 
individual vehicle which in the event of a pressure 

loss in the main air line (HL) effects actuation of the 
brake cylinder (3) which is proportional to the amount 

of the pressure loss, characterised in that the control 
valve means comprises in each case an EP converter (6) 

with subsequent pressure converter (7) for controlled 
supply of the pressure medium to the brake cylinder, 

and furthermore has electronic and/or electromechanical 
means via which the pressure loss in the main air line 

can be measured and an electric driving signal for the 
EP converter (6) can be generated. 
A braking means for rail vehicles which is 
operated by pressure medium, according to one or more 

of Claims 1 to 3, or according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that an additional pressure/voltage 

converter (8) is arranged at the exit from the pressure 
converter (7), the pressure of which converter (8) can 

be fed into the electronic equipment (10) as an actual 
value, and can be compared with the desired pressure 

triggered by the main air line. 
A braking means for rail vehicles which is 
operated by pressure medium, according to one or more 

of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
proportional valve characteristic is stored in a 

microelectronic storage medium,
 
that the means recognises or determines the specific 

triggering pressure for each vehicle, and said pressure 
can be taken into account adaptively in the stored 

valve characteristic.  
 
A braking means for rail vehicles which is 
operated by pressure medium, according to one or more 

of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
supply unit (14) for supplying power to the electronic 

equipment (10) can be switched to supply voltage via a 
switch (13) which switches dependent on the pressure in 

the main air line, and that a battery (60) is provided 
in parallel to the entry to the supply unit.
