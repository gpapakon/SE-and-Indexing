<ABSTRACT>
The control device is equipped with at least one two-dimensional jet pipe (nozzle) with pressure reduction/deflection (10a, 10b) comprising a first main profiled wall exhibiting a first part (11a; 11b) substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle and delimiting a combustion chamber (20a; 20b), a second curved part (12a; 12b) delimiting a jet pipe throat, a third part (13a; 13b) essentially rectilinear and inclined by a predetermined angle  theta with respect to the axis of the vehicle and a fourth curved part (14a; 14b), the concavity of which is in the opposite direction to that of the second part (12a; 12b), a second main profiled wall exhibiting a first part (16a; 16b) substantially parallel to the axis of the vehicle and delimiting the said combustion chamber, a second curved part (17a; 17b) delimiting the said jet pipe throat, a third part (18a; 18b) which is essentially rectilinear and an end ridge (19a; 19b) defining a focal point for the jet pipe, and first and second substantially planar side walls joining the first and second main profiled walls together. The device comprises means for selectively altering in flight the position of the end ridge constituting the focal point (19a; 19b) of the jet pipe and creating a non-axial component of thrust of modulus and of direction which have been determined so as to give rise to a pitching or yawing movement.

first part (11; 111) more or less parallel to the longitudinal
axis of the vehicle and delimits a combustion

chamber (20), a curved second part (12; 112) delimiting
the throat (21) of the nozzle, a third part (13; 113)

which is essentially straight and inclined at a predetermined
angle  with respect to the axis of the

vehicle and a curved fourth part (14; 114) which is
curved in the opposite direction to the second part (12;

112), a second shaped main wall which has a first part
(16; 116) more or less parallel to the axis of the

vehicle and delimits said combustion chamber (20), a
curved second part (17; 117) delimiting the said throat

(21) of the nozzle, a third part (18; 141, 142; 241, 242)
which is essentially straight, and an end edge (19; 119;

119', 119") defining a centre of pressure of the nozzle,
and first and second more or less flat side walls (131,

132) connecting the first and second shaped main walls,
the device comprising means (171 to 174; 271) for

selectively altering, in flight, the position of the end
edge forming the centre of pressure (19; 119; 119', 119")

of the nozzle and creating a non-axial thrust component
with a modulus and direction which are determined in

order to bring about a pitching or yawing movement.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the end edge (19; 119; 119', 119") defining the 

centre of pressure of the nozzle is mounted so that it
can pivot about a pin (146) located close to the curved

second part (17; 117) of the second shaped main wall.
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the end edge (119) is split into two parallel

edges (119', 119") each of which can pivot independently
and in that a dividing partition (150) is placed along

the axis of the nozzle at right angles to the two
parallel edges (119', 119") which are themselves situated

one on either side of the dividing partition (150) which
splits the nozzle into two flow regions.
Device according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized
in that the end edge (19; 119; 119', 119") defining the

centre of pressure of the nozzle and the corresponding
pivot pin (146) are connected by a plate (241, 242)

forming a flap.
Device according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized
in that the end edge (19; 119; 119', 119") defining the

centre of pressure of the nozzle and the corresponding
pivot pin (146) belong to a swinging structure in the

shape of a U-shaped trough (141, 143, 151, 152; 142, 144,
153, 154; 141, 143, 151, 154).
Device according to Claims 3 and 5, characterized
in that the dividing partition (150) consists of two

adjacent side walls (152, 153) of two trough-shaped
swinging structures side by side so as to bring about an

independent pivoting of each of the two parallel end
edges (119', 119").
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
