<ABSTRACT>
The recording apparatus of the present invention 
comprises a recording part in which a layer of a heat-fusible 

recording material (12) is formed opposite a recording 
medium (50) with a gap (d) between, the recording part being so 

constructed as to selectively heat said heat-fusible 

recording material (12), thereby vaporizing or ablating it, and 
transfer the vapor to the recording medium through the 

gap (d), the recording material containing a heat energy 
absorber which promotes the heating of the recording 

material. The invention should preferably be modified 
such that the recording material contains uniformly dissolved 

therein a light-heat converting dye which, upon 
irradiation with light, absorbs the light of specific 

wavelength and heats the recording dye. The recording 
apparatus should preferably have a semiconductor (18) to emit 

laser as an energy source to selectively vaporize or 
ablate the recording material, and a means to continuously 

feed the recording medium (50) to the recording part, the 
recording medium having an image receiving layer (50a) which 

faces, with a gap between, the layer of the recording 
material in the recording part. The recording dye should 

preferably contain uniformly dissolved therein a light-heat 
converting polymeric material which has in the main 

chains or side chains, or at the terminals a dye segment 
capable of absorbing the light of specific wavelength 

which is irradiated to heat the recording dye. This 
prevents the vaporization of the dye component capable of 

absorbing light. The invention may be modified such that 
the recording material contains a light-heat converting 

pigment capable of absorbing the light of specific 
wavelength irradiated for heating, said pigment being 

surface-treated for improved dispersion into the recording 
material. According to the present invention, it is 

desirable that at least one of the light-heat converting 
dye, light-heat converting polymeric material, and light-heat 

converting pigment be in the state of uniform segregation 
at the interface between the layer of the recording 

material and the gap. The present invention is embodied 
also in a recording method which comprises transferring 

the recording material to the recording medium by using 
the recording apparatus. The present invention provides a 

recording apparatus and recording method assured of high-quality 
recording with high thermal efficiency, 

facilitating the reduction in size and in weight, freed of 
wastes such as used ink sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording 
apparatus and a recording method, and more particularly, 
to a thermal recording apparatus and a thermal recording 
method using the apparatus. It has recently become more popular than before 
to record in colors the images of video camera, television, 
and computer graphics. This has aroused a sudden 
demand for colored hard copies. To meet this demand there 
have been developed color printers of various types. Among various recording systems is the thermal 
transfer system which employs an ink sheet and a thermal 
recording head. The ink sheet has an ink layer formed 
thereon from an adequate binder resin and a transferable 
dye dispersed therein in high concentrations. In printing 
operation, the ink sheet is pressed under certain pressure 
against a piece of printing paper (or any other proper 
medium) coated with a dyeable resin which receives the 
transferred dye. Dye transfer takes place as the thermal 
recording head on the ink sheet generates heat in response 
to image signals. Thus the dye is transferred from the 
ink sheet to the printing paper in proportion to the 
amount of heat. If the above-mentioned procedure is repeated for  
 
image signals separated into subtractive primaries (i.e., 
yellow, magenta, and cyan), it is possible to produce a 
color image having a continuous gradation. The thermal 
transfer system is attracting attention because it 
provides high-quality images comparable to those of silver 
halide color photography, it simply needs a small-sized, 
easy-to-maintain machine, and it operates on the real-time 
basis. Fig. 1 is a schematic front view showing the 
important parts of a printer of the thermal transfer 
system. There are shown a thermal recording head 61 
(referred to as thermal head hereinafter) and a platen 
roller 63, which face each other. Between them are 
interposed an ink sheet 62 and a sheet of recording paper 
(transfer medium) 70. The ink sheet 62 is composed of a 
base film 62b and an ink layer 62a formed thereon. The 
recording paper 70 is composed of paper 70b and a dyeable 
resin layer 70a formed thereon. They pass over the 
thermal head 61 under pressure exerted by the rotating 
platen roller 63. Upon selective heating by the thermal head 61, 
the ink (transferable dye) in the ink layer 62a is 
transferred to the dyeable resin layer 70a of the transfer 
medium 70. In this way thermal transfer printing in dot 
pattern is accomplished. Thermal transfer printing of  
 
this type is usually based on the
