<ABSTRACT>
An optical fiber which has a hollow in its central part and whose peripheral part is made of plastic. In the cross section of 

the peripheral part, (1) a sea-island structure is adopted, (2) each island is made of a core whose refractivity is at least higher than 
that of the sheath resin, (3) the sea is made of the sheath resin or a third resin, (4) the cores are surrounded by the sheath resin, 

and (5) no air void is included substantially. The optical fiber has continuously the foregoing cross section from its one end to the 
other end in the axial direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multicore hollow optical
fiber and a method for preparation thereof. More particularly,
this invention is concerned with a multicore hollow
optical fiber which can be used for a compact endoscope and an
optical sensor in medical and measuring industries by
arranging, in its hollow, an image optical fiber, a single
optical fiber, optical parts such as a lens, an electric cord,
electric parts such as an electrode and an electron element,
fluid such as gas and liquid, a chemical reaction material and
the like; and also with a method for preparation thereof.U.S. Patent No. 4,806,289 discloses a hollow optical
fiber comprising a hollow central part and a peripheral part
wherein the first layer is a cladding layer; the second layer
is a core layer; and the third layer is a cladding layer, as
shown in Fig. 11 of the present specification. The hollow
optical fiber is stiff and does not have bending properties
because of its layer structure. Accordingly, the hollow optical
fiber easily buckles by bending and it easily breaks by
cracking. Further, a fiber is not easily inserted into the
hollow part of the hollow optical fiber because the hollow
optical fiber has low elasticity.Japanese Patent Publication No. 211761/1969 proposes a
method for preparing a multicore hollow optical fiber wherein 
many optical fibers 20 are arranged around stem 19 in the
layer to form a fiber bundle as shown in Fig. 12 of the present
specification. The fiber bundle is heated to soften the
optical fibers and to fusion-bond the outer layer, and then it
is wound up while drawing. In this specification, there is no
description in regard to the quality of the optical fiber.
However, when a plastic optical fiber is prepared according to
the above-mentioned method, voids remain between each optical
fiber even if the resultant fiber bundle is heated so as to
completely fusion-bond each optical fiber. Therefore, a
multicore hollow optical fiber obtained by this method is
easily taken into pieces by bending. Further, light cannot
easily pass through the fiber since the cladding and core
resins are mixed up. Accordingly, there cannot be obtained a
high quality multicore hollow optical fiber suitable for a
medical endoscope, of which fibers have a high accuracy in a
bore or an outside diameter of the hollow over one to several
meters in length and do not unnaturally bend or break by
bending. Further, this method for preparing the fiber has a
shortcoming in high cost caused by its complicated producing
steps.On
