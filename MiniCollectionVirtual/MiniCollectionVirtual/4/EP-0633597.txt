<ABSTRACT>
A plasma display device is provided with one 
substrate having a plurality of electrode drawing-out 

portions extending up to a side end thereof for 
applying an AC voltage to X side electrodes each 

independently, a second substrate having a plurality of 
electrode terminal portions formed independently on its 

electrode-disposed surface, the plural electrode 
terminal portions being electrically connected 

respectively to the plural electrode drawing-out 
portions by a connector portion. The connection of 

each of the X and Y electrodes with an external power 
source can thus be made on only the Y side electrode-disposed 

surface of the second substrate. Besides, the 
shape of the substrates is simplified. 
In addition, said connector means comprises a spacer member (8) 
having a plurality of through-holes for enabling communication between 

said electrode connector terminals (4) and corresponding electrodes (2) 
of said second substrate (1), sai
d through-holes being filled with 
electrically conductive material (9) for electrically connecting said 

electrode connector terminals (4) to said electrodes (2) of said second 
substrate (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a plasma display device suitable for use as a computer 
terminal display device or a destination display device comprising a first transparent 
substrate having a plurality of linear electrodes arranged thereon in parallel in 
a first direction; a second transparent substrate having a plurality of linear electrodes 
arranged thereon in parallel in a second direction orthogonal to said first 
direction; said first and second substrates being hermetically sealed together to 
form a discharge space therebetween with said electrodes intersecting to form a 
display matrix; a discharge gas sealed within said discharge space for emitting a 
visible plasma discharge when a predetermined driving voltage is applied between 
intersecting electrodes; a plurality of electrode connector terminals arranged along 
peripheral edge portions of said first substrate for connection to an a.c. driving 
voltage; connector means for electrically connecting said plurality of electrodes 
arranged on said second substrate to respective ones of said electrode connector 
terminals; and means for providing a.c. driving voltage to said plurality of electrodes 
on said first substrate. Such a plasma display device is known from the U.S. patent US-A-4,039,882. 
Further, H.A. Whitaker describes in "IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin", Vol. 15, 
no. 9, February 1973, page 2774, a gas discharge panel with built-in cavity. This 
panel being provided with two step surfaces, one carrying a plurality of electrodes 
and another one being sealed to a transparent substrate.  
 In a plasma display device, a plurality of linear 
electrodes are arranged in parallel and closely spaced 
on each of a pair of insulating plates formed by a 
transparent, hard material such as, for example, glass, 
both insulating plates being opposed to each other so 
that the linear electrodes cross perpendicularly in the 
form of a matrix through a thin discharge space, the 
outer peripheral portion being sealed hermetically and 
the interior being evacuated and filled with an inert 
gas such as neon. An AC voltage is applied between 
selected ones of the linear electrodes to cause gas 
discharge between the intersecting points of the 
electrodes, thereby forming a predetermined luminous 
display pattern. Fig. 1 is a sectional view showing a conventional 
plasma display device, in which the numeral 1 denotes a 
front glass as a display surface of a conventional 
plasma display device; numeral 2 represents a row of 
long, thin, strip-like front
