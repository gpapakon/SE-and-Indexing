<ABSTRACT>
The radiation generated by at least one radiation source is controlled so as to generate a constant radiation intensity, thereby to cause the object to be heated, and the radiation intensity from the object at a first wavelength is sensed until it is equal to the present radiation intensity generated by the at least one radiation source, whereby the temperature of the object has a predetermined value. From that time on, the development of the actual temperature of the object is controlled accurately according to a predetermined programme merely be sensing the radiation intensity from the object at a second wavelength larger than the first wavelength, and using the measuring signal representative of the sensed radiation intensity to continuously control the radiation intensity generated by the at least one radiation source.

<DESCRIPTION>
 System for the controlled heating of an objectField of the inventionThe present invention relates to a system for control¬ ling the heating of an object using radiation, in particular a system for controlling the heating of a wafer of semiconductor material for the manufacture of semiconductor components .Background of the inventionWhen heating an object using radiation from a heating source the temperature of the object is currently controlled and measured using pyrometers. Prior art is illustrated e.g. by US-A-4 ,755 , 654 ; US-A-4 ,919 , 542; US-A-4,649,261; DE-A-4012615 and F. Roozeboom, Journal Vac. Sc. Techn., B8 , 1249 (1990). The temperature measurement provided by pyrometers, however, is highly dependent on the emissivity of the object being heated and therefore measurement of the emissivity is desir¬ able when accurate temperature measurement is re¬ quired. However, measurement of the emissivity gener¬ ally cannot be carried out efficiently outside the heating apparatus, i.e. at ambient temperature because under 600°C the emissivity is depending on the temper¬ ature level (P. Vandenabeele et al, Proc. MRS 224, 185, Fig. 4 (1990)). Consequently, it is necessary in practice to provide for in situ measurement of the emissivity above 600°C. 

For that purpose, methods have been provided which use external radiation sources arranged for intermittently projecting radiation onto the object to be heated and provide measurement of the reflected radiation from said object. The following documents are cited as prior art references : US-A-4 ,956 , 538; US-A-4 ,919 ,542 ; US- A-4,979,133; US-A-4 ,890,245 NL-A-8701479; DE-A- 2153077. The drawback of these known methods is that the radiation source when used inside a heating cham- ber has a very narrow angular field of action whereby the emissivity measurement is greatly depending on the roughness of the surface of the object being irradiat¬ ed. This drawback prevents these known methods from being applied generally (Mosledi et al, Proc. MRS 224, 143, (1990)).In another known method an extended black body is heated to the same temperature as the object to be heated (US-A-3,196,690; US-A-3,969,943; GB-A- 2,078,767; DE-A-3 ,422 ,590 ) . The radiation from the black body is directed to the object; when the temper¬ ature of the black body is equal to the temperature of the object, the radiation from the black body is equal to the sum of the radiation from the object and the reflected radiation from the black body, whereby the temperature measurement of the

- using a measuring signal representative of the sensed radiation intensity to further control the radiation intensity generated by the at least one radiation source, thereby to control the development of the temperature of said object as a function of the sensed radiation intensity.

4. A method as claimed in claim 1, further comprising the step of sensing the radiation intensity from the object at a third wavelength lower than the first wavelength and using the measuring signal representa- tive of the sensed radiation intensity to determine the present reflectivity of the object at a particular location of said object.
