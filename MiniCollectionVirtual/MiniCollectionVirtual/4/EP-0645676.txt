<ABSTRACT>
The films are developed and printed continuously and 
automatically even if the film feed direction in the film 

processor and the one in the printer are not in the same 
vertical plane. A film stocking unit is provided 

downstream of the film driving unit. The film stocking 
unit is movable to a position aligned with the film feed 

path extending to the printing unit. This increases the 
freedom or flexibility in arranging the film processor and 

the printer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a photographic processing
machine for automatically developing and drying film,
printing images on films onto photographic paper, and
developing and drying the photographic paper
according to the preamble of claim 1.As shown in Figs. 18 and 19, this type of
photographic processing machine has a film developing unit
A comprising a plurality of treating tanks, a film drying
unit B, a printing unit C, a printed paper developing unit
D having a plurality of treating tanks, and a printed paper
drying unit E. Films F are fed through the units A, B and
C. Web of photographic paper P is fed through the units C,
D and E. While feeding films and photographic paper, the
films are developed and dried and the images thereon are
printed onto the photographic paper. The thus printed
photographic paper is developed and dried. These steps are
all carried out automatically.A photographic processing machine of this type is disclosed
in DE-A-41 10 642.In the photographic art, the film developing unit A
and film drying unit B are usually referred to
comprehensively as a film processor, while the printing
unit C, printed paper developing unit D and printed paper
drying unit E are comprehensively called a printer.In such a photographic processing device, since the
film is in the form of a tape, it can not be turned in the 
same horizontal plane. For this reason, the film feed path
G extending from the film drying unit B to the printing
unit C is located right over the film drying unit B (Fig.
18), or it extends straight ahead from the unit B (Fig.
19).With either of the above arrangements, the device is
inevitably elongated in a vertical direction or in a
longitudinal direction. In recent years, photographic
processing device of this kind are installed in small
places. In view of the restriction resulting therefrom,
there is an increased demand for more compact photographic
processing devices.An object of the present invention is to provide a
photographic processing device in which the films can be
developed and printed continuously and automatically even
if the film feed direction in the film processor and that
in the printer are not in the same vertical plane.In order to solve the above problems, according to
the present invention, the photographic processing machine comprises
the features set out in claim 1. Thus, the film developing
unit and the film drying unit are arranged along a straight line
from a film inlet formed in the film developing unit, a second
film feed path extending to the

<CLAIMS>
A photographic processing machine comprising a film developing unit (A), a film
drying unit (B), a printing unit (C), a photographic paper developing unit (D) and a

photographic paper drying unit (E), wherein a film (F) is fed through the film
developing unit and the film drying unit to develop and dry the film, and wherein

photographic paper (P) is fed through the printing unit, photographic paper
developing unit and photographic paper drying unit to print images on the film

onto the photographic paper and to develop and dry the photographic paper,
characterized in that
a first film feed path through said film developing unit (A) and said film drying unit
(B) is arranged along a straight line from a film inlet (1) formed in said film

developing unit (A), a second film feed path extending to said printing unit (C) is
provided in a direction parallel to said straight line of said first film feed path that

extends through said film developing unit (A) and said film drying unit (B),
and that a film storing unit (Q
2
) is provided downstream of said film drying unit
(B), said film storing unit being slideable between two positions aligned with either said first

or said second film feed path, for shifting a film between said first and second film
feed path.
A photographic processing machine according to claim 1, further comprising
means (41) for separating the leader from the film, said means being provided

upstream of said printing unit (C).
