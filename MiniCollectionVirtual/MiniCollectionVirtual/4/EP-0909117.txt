<ABSTRACT>
An improved method of making a multiple print thick film
circuit wherein the alignment between successive conductor print steps is both

optically inspectable and electrically testable. The first of two or more
successive conductor prints includes a pair of adjacent alignment features (10,12),

and the successive conductor prints include identical alignment features
which are printed in registry with the alignment features of the first conductor

print. The alignment features are defined by a pair of contiguous mutually
perpendicular conductor segments or surfaces resembling a box or an upper

case L. With proper print alignment, there is a non-conductive gap between
adjacent alignment features, and test probes (44,46) brought into contact with

the features (30',32') or associated probe pads (50) will reveal a high or open-circuit
impedance therebetween. However, if the second conductor print is misaligned

relative to the first print, one or more of its alignment feature
segments or surfaces will bridge the gap between the first pair of alignment

features, and test probes brought into contact with the features or associated
probe pads (50) will reveal a low or short-circuit impedance therebetween.

The spacing between adjacent alignment features is less than the smallest
conductor spacing on the circuit. Because the gap between alignment features

is smaller than the circuit spacing, the test equipment can detect alignment
errors large enough to short-circuit the adjacent alignment features, but not so

large as to cause shorting in the actual circuit. Alignment features may be
formed at multiple locations throughout the substrate to detect localized

misalignment, and adjacent alignment features may span individual circuits
formed on the same substrate (60).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the manufacture and testing of thick film circuits having multiple conductor print steps.In the manufacture of thick film circuits, a conductive ink composition is wiped across a print screen by a squeegee to form a conductor pattern on a substrate underlying the print screen. Normally, a layer of dielectric is interposed between successive conductor layers, but it has been proposed to use multiple successive conductor printing steps with no intervening dielectric. In certain cases, multiple printing is used to produce fine pitch features; in other cases, it is used to over-print as a means of improving reliability or producing extra thick or multiple composition conductor systems.In the manufacture of single print thick film circuits, as described for example in US 4,914,829, it is customary to print an alignment or registration feature in the margin of the substrate that can be optically inspected to measure the alignment of the print relative to the substrate or a previous print. Such optical alignment testing is time-consuming and is generally performed off-line on a random basis to detect gross alignment errors. Moreover, such optical alignment testing is fairly limited, as it cannot be used to detect other printing flaws such as excessive line spread, and localized print distortion due to stretching of the print screen, for example. These flaws are particularly significant in multiple print circuits because misalignment, localized print distortion and excessive line spread may result in inadvertent shorting between conductors, especially in fine pitch circuits.The present invention is directed to an improved method of making a multiple print thick film circuit wherein the alignment between successive conductor print steps is both optically inspectable and electrically testable. The first of two or more successive conductor prints includes a pair of adjacent alignment features, and the successive conductor prints include identical pair of adjacent alignment features which are printed in registry with the pair of adjacent alignment features of the first conductor print. The alignment features are defined by a pair of contiguous mutually perpendicular conductor segments or surfaces resembling a box or an upper case L. With proper print alignment, there is a non-conductive gap between the pair of adjacent alignment features, and test probes brought into contact with the features or associated probe pads will reveal a high or open-circuit impedance therebetween.
