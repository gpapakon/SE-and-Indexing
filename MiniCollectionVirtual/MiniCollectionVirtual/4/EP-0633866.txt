<ABSTRACT>
For batchwise biological and eventually chemical purification of soil or waste water there is used a sludge separator tank (3) and a reactor tank (4). The reactor tank (4) comprises a standpipe (9) for draining clear (purified) water (17) through an outlet thereof by means of overpressure provided in the reactor tank (4), preferably an overpressure provided by an air compression means like a side channel fan (19). The overpressure also can be used for removing excess sludge (14) from the reactor tank (4), for instance returning such excess sludge (14) to the sludge separator tank (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for 
intermittently treating soil water and/or waste water by means of a 
biological purification and, upon need, also by a chemical purification. The 
apparatus for this purpose comprises a conventional sludge separator, or 
alternatively a balancing tank, and a reaction apparatus, called reactor. An apparatus for purification of soil water is known from US-A-4,596,658. 
Said apparatus operates by a well known decanting technics, 
whereby the water in the batch reactor is being decanted solely following 
the water level in the reactor tank and without using any pressure means 
for draining the purified water. The purification process according to the invention is built on a 
modern technique which in the litterature is referred to as SBR technolgy, 
which expression stands for Sequencing Batch Reactor Technology. In short the SBR technology functions so that a reaction apparatus 
containing active sludge receives a batch of soil water or waste water for 
treatment thereof according to a predetermined cycle, whereupon the cycle 
is repeated for a new batch of soil water. According to known art the 
operation cycle generally is as follows: 
filling up the apparatus with soil water treating the soil water with air (aeration) sedimentation draining of clear water, and draining of excess sludge (not always in every cycle). According to the present invention the SBR technology has been 
modified in that the sludge separator or any other balancing or levelling tank 
be made cooperating with the reactor, whereby it should be able to put said 
reactor under a certain over pressure. To this end a blowing apparatus is 
used, for instance some type of compressor or a side channel fan. Said 
blowing apparatus is used 
both for treating the active sludge in the reactor tank with air 
(aeration), for creating an over pressure in the reactor tank, which over 
pressure is used for draining clear (purified) water from the tank and also for 
draining active sludge, for instance recycling said sludge to the sludge 
separator, for closing a hose valve between the sludge separator and the  
 
reactor, and finally also for admixing dosed amounts of flocculation and/or 
precipitation chemicals. The said blowing apparatus consequently is the main source of 
energy for the entire system and this is the basis for the simple and safe 
operation of the entire process, and is thereby the reason why the process 
is suitable for small plants which are only rarely supervised.

<CLAIMS>
Method for batchwise purification, by biological and, upon need, 
chemical, treatment of soil or waste water in a reactor tank (4) having a 

tight lid (6) and arranged for making it possible to create an over pressure in 
the reactor tank (4), 
characterized
 in that ready treated water in the reactor 
tank (4) is pressed up through a standpipe (9) and to an outlet (11) of the 

reactor tank (4) and is drained by means of an over pressure provided by a 
blower machine (19), and in that excess sludge is thereafter forced out of 

the reactor tank (4) using a static over pressure, which is the pressure 
remained in the reactor tank (4) after said blower machine has been 

switched off, or provided by a blower machine. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the excess 
sludge (14) is forced out of the reactor tank (4) and into a sludge separator 

tank (3). 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that the soil or 
waste water (18) first enters a sludge separator or a balancing tank (3), in 

which some of the sludge existing in the water sediments, and after a 
predetermined water level has been reached in the reactor tank (4) a valve 

means (V1) of a hose (8) is opened and the soil or waste water flows into 
the reactor tank (4), and in that a portion of the sludge (14) formed in the 

reactor tank (4) is pressed back to the sludge separator (3) through the 
same hose (8) and valve means (V1) through which the water is transmitted 

to the reactor tank (4). 
Method according to claim 3, 
characterized
 in that the hose (8) 
extends between the sludge separator / the balancing tank (3) and the 

reactor tank (4), and in that the valve means (V1) thereof, which is a hose
