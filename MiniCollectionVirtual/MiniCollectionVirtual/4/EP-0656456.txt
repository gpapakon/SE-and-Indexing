Safety closure device for a pivoting member (1), such 
as a vehicle bonnet, which comprises a hook (5), having 

a U-shaped section, pivotally mounted about a pin (4) 
relative to the member (1) and co-operating with a 

hooking part (8) under the action of an elastic return 
member (7),
 
characterised in that the hook (5) comprises means for 

holding the elastic return member (7) in its mounted 

position in the hook, before the pivoting pin (4) is 
positioned. 
Safety device according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the elastic return member (7) is 

constituted by an elastic wire forming a spring and 
comprising a cylindrical central portion (7
a
) with 
contiguous turns through which the pin (4) is intended 

to pass and extended, at one of its ends, by a 
rectilinear portion (7
b
) perpendicular to the axis of 
the portion (7
a
) and, at its other end, by a hairpin-shaped 
portion (7
d
) located in a plane perpendicular to 
said axis of the portion (7
a
). 
Safety device according to Claim 2,
 
characterised in that the means for holding the elastic 

return member (7) inside the hook (5) comprise indexing 
means (5
e
-5
f
) for the spring, a stop (12) for the 
rectilinear portion (7
b
) of the spring, and milled 
areas (5
g
) serving as a housing for the cylindrical 
portion (7
a
) of the spring. 
Safety device according to Claim 3,
 
characterised in that the indexing means for the spring  

 
(7) are constituted by two bosses (5
e
 and 5
f
) provided 
on the inner face of the wings (5
a
 and 5
b
) of the hook 
(5). 
Safety device according to Claim 3 or 4,
 
characterised in that the stop (12) is provided on the 

inner face of the wing (5
a
) of the hook 5. 
Safety device according to one of Claims 3 to 5,
 
characterised in that the milled areas (5
g
) are made in 
two bosses (5
e
 and 5
f
) provided on the inner face of 
the wings (5
a
 and 5
b
). 
Safety device according to one of Claims 3 to 6,
 
characterised in that the pin (4) comprises a groove 

(4
d
 or 4
e
) in which the hairpin branch (7
d
) of the 
spring (7) can be engaged, which immobilises the pin in 

translation. 
Safety device according to Claim 7,
 
characterised in that the pin (4) is generally 

cylindrical in shape and has at one of its ends a 
portion (4
b
) shaped like a truncated cone and, at its 
other end, a shoulder (4
c
), two identical grooves (4
d
 
and 4
e
) being provided between the portion (4
b
) and the 
shoulder (4
c
). 
Safety device according to Claim 8,
 
characterised in that the grooves (4
d
 and 4
e
) are 
arranged so that one of them is facing the hairpin 

branch (7
d
) of the spring (7), whichever side the pin 
(4) is introduced into the hook (5).
