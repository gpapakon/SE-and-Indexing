<ABSTRACT>
A teletext clock synchronisation circuit in which the teletext signal is supplied 
as one input to an XOR gate and a clock signal at half the teletext signal frequency 

is applied to the XOR gate as its other input. The resulting output from the XOR gate 
is applied to an accumulator with a fixed number of teletext signal cycles and the 

accumulated value in the accumulator is used to alter the phase of the signal to be 
used to sample the teletext signal relative to the phase of the teletext signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the synchronisation of clock signals, particularly in 
teletext or programme delivery control decoding systems. Teletext or programme delivery control (PDC) systems operate by sending 
digital data with a television signal, the digital data being transmitted between the lines 
of picture information carried by the television signal. The data is sent as a series of 
digital data lines at a fixed clock rate (generally 6.9375 MHz) and these data lines are 
interleaved between picture signal lines. The data is sampled by a data decoder 
clocked at the same frequency to extract the digital data from the TV signal. A 
problem with these systems is that the data clock rate is not linked in phase to any 
part of the TV picture signal and as a result the clock signal used by the data decoder 
in each television must synchronise itself with the received data signal. PDC is a specialised form of teletext in which the teletext data includes 'labels' 
indicating the start and stop of programmes to control video recorders. In order to allow this synchronisation each data line starts with a clock "run in" 
consisting of 8 bits of alternating ones and zeroes and the data decoder must be able 
to recognise the clock run in and adjust the phase of the clock signal to be used for 
sampling the data line to have the optimum phase relationship with the teletext data 
line. Known systems for teletext clock synchronisation operate by counting the edges 
of the incoming run in signal and after four bits find the next edge, the sampling phase  
 
to be used by the teletext decoder on the teletext data is then taken as starting two 
6.9375 MHz clock cycles following this edge. This phase is then used for sampling 
the full line of teletext data. This technique is not always reliable because it is totally dependent on the 
leading edge of the fifth bit being perfect and the quality and accuracy with which this 
single edge is received determines the effectiveness of data sampling for the whole 
line of teletext data. If any noise or interference or sampling errors corrupt this fifth 
edge the whole line of teletext data can be lost and as a result systems of this type 
are very sensitive to interference and noise. As a result it is quite possible that the 
relative phases of the teletext data clocking rate and the teletext decoder clock cannot 
be arranged to be an optimum for accurate sampling. A further problem with this system is that it can work only on signals having 
an equal mark to space ratio

<CLAIMS>
A clock phase synchronisation circuit comprising an XOR gate to which a data 
signal is supplied as one input and a first clock signal at half the data signal 

frequency is applied as the other input, an accumulator and a clock generator 
in which; the output of the XOR gate is supplied to the accumulator over a fixed 

number of data signal cycles so that the accumulator generates a number 
related to the relative phases of the data and first clock signals, and this 

number is supplied to the clock generator which adjusts the phase of a second 
clock signal at the data signal frequency and used to clock sampling of the data 

signal in dependence on the number. 
A circuit as claimed in Claim 1 in which the data signal is a teletext signal. 
A circuit as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 in which state logging means are 
also provided which compare the data and first clock signals applied to the 

XOR gate and generate an output indicating whether the phase difference 
between them is in the range ± 90° or not. 
A circuit as claimed in Claim 3 in which the phase of the second clock signal 
is adjusted in dependence on the number and the output of the state logging 

means. 
A circuit as claimed in any preceding claim in which the accumulator is supplied 
with a third clock signal and increases its count by one each time it receives a 

 
clock pulse and the signal from the XOR gate is high and decreases its count 

by one each time it receives a clock pulse and the signal from the XOR gate 
is low. 
A circuit as claimed in Claim 5 in which the data signal has a frequency of 
6.9375 MHz and the third clock signal has a frequency of 55.5 MHz.
