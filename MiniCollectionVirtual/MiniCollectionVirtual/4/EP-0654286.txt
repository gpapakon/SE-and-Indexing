<ABSTRACT>
The method consists in interrupting the blood circulation in an area of 
the body to be treated, preferably in one arm, by means of a tourniquet and, 

in this situation of temporary interruption of the blood circulation, proceeding 
to a thermal increase of the latter by application of electromagnetic waves 

(microwaves), laser or capacitive transmission, up to reaching a temperature 
capable of destroying the viruses, while providing simultaneously for a 

continuous agitation of the blood, through percussion or impingement, in order 
to avoid the coagulation of the blood. The equipment comprises an operative 

head (12) provided with means for regulating its position as to the height and the 
orientation so as to adapt the equipment to the patient, the head being provided 

with a bell (13) for application of heat and vibrations, said bell having a wave 
emission device which is associated by means of a transmission line (21) to the 

corresponding generator, whereas the purcusive motion is generated by a motor 
(11) which, through an excentric (19), imparts an alternate motion against a 

spring (20) to a percussion piston terminated by an impinger (25).

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject-matter of the present invention relates 
to a new method for treating virus diseases in general 
based upon the part-destruction of such viruses whereupon 
the immunological system of the patient will be in a 
position to provide a rapid and appropriate response, by 
creating specific antibodies, to eliminate the rest of 
the viruses that shall have invaded the body of the 
patient. The invention also relates to an electromechanical 
apparatus for putting into practice the said method. There is no doubt that viruses causing influenza 
affect the human population most and there are manifold 
varieties of these viruses against which specific 
vaccines are prepared that tend to prevent possible 
epidemics. In particular, the said vaccines are manufactured 
within a laboratory using attenuated viruses that are per 
se incapable of developing the disease albeit stimulating 
organic immunology to create specific antibodies to these 
viruses, and so organism has suitable defences against 
potential influenza infection. And yet viruses other than the expected viruses  
 
often appear, which is extremely frequent given the 
extent to which viruses are capable of genetic mutation 
when they are in an environment that is unfavourable for 
their normal development and proliferation. This means that it is almost impossible to prepare 
a specific vaccine capable of battling against all 
viruses, having regard to their potential states of 
genetic mutation, and moreover it is not possible to 
obtain specific vaccines for certain particular types of 
viruses, as with the HIV virus causing the Acquired 
Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In all of these cases 
where vaccine-based preventive treatment is impossible 
there are frequently endemics or epidemics that have a 
high social cost because of leaves off work and the 
consumption of chemotherapeutic products, that at times 
do not yield the desired results either. It is also a known fact that the first defence the 
organism stages against an infection, be it viral, 
bacterial or originating in another pathogenous germ, 
comprises raising the body temperature in order to 
attenuate or destroy the viruses or germs and thereby put 
into place an appropriate response from the immunological 
system to create specific antibodies. The human organism relies on its own temperature 
adjustment system that maintains blood temperature, 
regardless of room temperature, at around 37°C. In the event of a virus infection, for instance 
influenza, the organism raises

Virus desease treatment method, characterised 
for it consists in the blood flow be cut off in a 

particular area of the body to be treated, preferably on 
one of its extremities, such as an arm, applying a 

tourniquet, subsequently proceeding to raise the blood 
mass temperature contained at the area to be treated, by 

means of direct heat application at the organism bosom, 
through electromagnetic waves, laser, capacitive 

transmission or any other suitable mean, up to reach the 
necessary temperature for the virus cells be destroyed, 

of aroung 56ºC, it having been foreseen that parallel to 
this temperature raising, a blood permanent agitation be 

produced in order to prevent its coagulation by means of 
applying a vibrating movement ot the treated area, 

produced by a knocking. 
Method, as in claim 1, characterised in that 
the percussion or vibration effect is adjustable either 

in intensity as well as in orientation, the applied heat-power 
being also adjustable, it further having been 

foreseen that during the process an arterial pressure 
control be effected to allow to secure the treatment area 

isolation with respect to the rest of the circulatory 
system. 
An electromechanical virus disease treatment 
apparatus, characterised by comprising a fixed frame (1) 

in which a mobile frame (4) can travel vertically, the 
latter having a support (10) that can travel in the same 

direction and carries a head (12) that can be trained in 
any direction, fitted with a bell member (13) for 

adaption to the part of the body of the patient to be 
treated, which bell member (13) is internally fitted with 

 
a percussion rod (18) that is responsible for generating 

permanent blood agitation movement, and a wave emitter 
(22) that is in turn responsible for generating the heat 

required for the blood temperature to be raised to the 
required extent. 
An apparatus as in claim 1, characterised in 
that the fixed frame (1) has vertical slides (3) on its 

base platform (2) along which the mobile frame (4) 
travels, the latter travelling by means of a spindle (6) 

that is driven by a motor (5), the mobile frame (4) being 
also fitted with another motor (7) driving a spindle (8) 

that is responsible for supplying the head support (10) 
with vertical travel along slides (9). 
An apparatus as in claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the head support (10) is fork-shaped, 

and lying between its branches there is a motor 
(11) responsible for driving the percussion rod (18), 

said support (10) being fitted with a control (14) to 
locks its own turning movement, and the motor (11) having 

a turning wheel (15) between the arms of the support 
(10), a control (16) for said motor to be fixed and 

another tightening control (17) to turn the said 
percussion rod (18) chassis relative to the motor (11). 
An apparatus as in claims 1, 2 and 3, 
characterised in that the head (12) is provided with a 

cam or eccentric (19) through which the rotary movement 
of the motor (11) is transmitted as a reciprocating 

movement to the percussion rod (18) against a spring 
(20), the said head (12) also having a tube (21) 

connecting the wave emitter (22) lying in the bell member 
and the respective apparatus generating such waves, and 

the percussion rod (18) ending in a tapper (24) designed 
 

to contact with the body of the patient and which crosses 
a front cover (23) that closes the said bell member (13).
