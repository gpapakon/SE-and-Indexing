<ABSTRACT>
A method for detecting an analyte of 
interest in a sample includes the steps of binding the 

analyte to the surface of a substrate through a biotin-biotin 
binding protein interaction, contacting the 

surface-bound analyte with a quantitatively detectable 
analyte-binding moiety that binds thereto, measuring the 

quantity of detectable moiety bound to the substrate 
surface (11) and deriving therefrom the quantity of analyte 

in solution. A preferred use for the present method is 
in conjunction with a piezoelectric surface transverse 

wave device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method 
for quantitating an analyte of interest in a 
sample, 
to a method for binding an analyte to the surface of a 
substrate,so as to enable detection of the analyte 
thereon, and to a biotin-analyte complex. Many methods are known for detecting analytes of 
various kinds using a reactive solid surface. In many 
hybridization assay formats, for example, a label is 
detected on the surface of a substrate, e.g., on a glass 
or plastic bead, plate, tube or the like, to indicate 
the presence and/or quantity of an analyte of interest. 
There are also many types of chromatographic procedures 
in which reactive surfaces are used to facilitate the 
separation and/or detection of different types of 
analyte molecules. In still another context, mass 
biosensors are used to measure microquantities of 
biological materials, and, as with the aforementioned 
contexts, involve the use of a modified surface which 
selectively binds a particular component. Although the 
present invention is adaptable to a wide variety of 
contexts, it is particularly suited to use in 
conjunction with such mass biosensors. As explained in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 
5,130,257 to Baer et al., European Patent Publication 
No. 416,730, inventors Tom-Moy et al., and co-pending 
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/041,662, filed 
1 April 1993 (entitled "A Mass Sensor for Measuring 
Analytes in a Sample," inventors C.A. Myerholtz et al.),  
 
a preferred type of mass biosensor uses a piezoelectric 
crystal as an acoustic waveguide. Selective mass 
detection with such devices is achieved by coating the 
surface of the device with a chemically reactive layer 
that preferentially reacts with the substance to be 
detected such that the mass present on the reactive 
layer changes proportionately, i.e., relative to the 
amount of the substance to be detected. These devices 
thus function as chemical sensors that can measure the 
concentration of analytes in a solution into which the 
detector is immersed. For example, and as explained in 
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/041,662, cited 
above, piezoelectric surface wave devices have been used 
to measure the concentration of a specific antibody in 
solution using a conventional assay format, as follows. 
The mass-sensitive surface of the device is coated with 
a receptor layer which contains the antigen 
corresponding to the antibody. The device is then 
exposed to a sample solution, and antibody present in 
the solution will bind to the surface of the
