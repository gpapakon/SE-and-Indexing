<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an agent for fiber treatment and, 
more particularly, to an agent for water-repellent treatment of fibers 
(which is abbreviated to a water repellent, hereinafter) which can 
impart highly durable water repellency to fibers and the like under a 
simple process of treatment without exerting any bad influence on the 
environment. As for the method of giving water repellency to natural or 
synthetic fibers, there has so far been known the method of treating the 
fibers with silicone compounds capable of functioning as water 
repellent. In such a method, fibers are treated under high temperature. 
Therefore, that method has a disadvantage in being subject to 
restrictions on the species of fiber to which it is applicable. In 
addition, it has defects that it has low producibility because it 
requires a long treatment time and provides water repellency 
insufficient in durability. For the purpose of diminishing such defects, there have been 
submitted such proposals as to apply heat to certain silicone compounds 
to cause cross-linking reaction therein, thereby enabling them to 
produce water repellency and durability (Japanese Tokko Sho Nos. 51-9440, 
51-27465 and 53-4158). However, those proposals fail to ensure 
satisfactory water repellency and durability if the treatment is 
deficient in temperature and time, and so they are still insufficient 
for the purpose. On the other hand, it has also been known that fluorine-containing 
polymers, including homopolymers of polymerizable monomers containing  
 
perfluoro or fluoroalkyl groups in their individual molecules and 
copolymers of said monomers and other polymerizable monomers, can 
produce an excellent water-repellent effect and an antisoiling effect 
besides upon textile fabrics and the like even when they are used in a 
relatively small amount. Also, they have been utilized as surface 
finishing agent in the fields of the leather processing industry, the 
manufacture of building materials and so on. In giving water repellency or the like to textile goods, leather, 
building materials and so on, it is most convenient for ordinary 
consumers to use an agent for such a treatment in the form of aerosol 
spray. In order to efficiently provide materials as cited above with 
water repellency by the spraying operation of an aerosol, however, 
various restrictions are placed on the water repellent composition. More specifically, it is required of the composition to satisfy 
the following necessary conditions: 
(1) a jet gas for
