<ABSTRACT>
Si₃N₄ having a high thermal conductivity is produced 
from Si by a reaction sintering process. As a ceramic 

comprises Si, Y₂O₃, and Al₂O₃, the proportion of a sum 
weight of Al₂O₃ and Y₂O₃ to the total weight of the ceramic 

is 15% to 28% and the weight ratio of Y₂O₃ to Al₂O₃ is 3:1 
to 10:1. The thermal conductivity of the ceramic is 

increased as compared with a conventional ceramic.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reaction sintered 
ceramics having a higher thermal conductivity and to a 
method of producing the same. It is known in the production of silicon nitride 
(Si₃O₄) from silicon (Si) that during a reaction sintering 
process, an oxide substance is added to a parent material 
for accelerating the nitridation of silicon and increasing 
the mechanical strength of a silicon nitride product. Such 
processes are disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open 
Publications 58-88173 (1983), 59-152271 (1984), 59-207876 
(1984), 59-207877 (1984), 59-217673 (1984), and 60-186470 
(1985), and Japanese Patent Publications 59-34677 (1984) 
and 59-34678 (1984). Reaction sintered silicon products produced by the 
foregoing processes are increased more or less in 
mechanical strength but fail to describe the thermal 
conductivity. It is thus said that none of the 
conventional reaction sintered silicon products is 
favourably high in thermal conductivity. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
reaction sintered ceramic having a higher thermal 
conductivity as produced by a reaction sintering process. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a method of producing a reaction sintered ceramic 
having a higher thermal conductivity.  A reaction sintered ceramic consisting mainly of 
silicon nitride produced from a mixture of silicon (Si), 
yttrium oxide (Y₂O₃), and alumina (Al₂O₃) has a high thermal 
conductivity when its components are mixed in a desired 
ratio. In the production of such a reaction sintered ceramic 
from a mixture of Si, Y₂O₃, and Al₂O₃ in addition of 
titanium (Ti), when the nitridation of Ti to form titanium 
nitride (TiN) is carried out in the atmosphere of high 
temperature, TiN tends to turn to titanium oxide (TiO₂) 
thus decreasing the thermal conductivity. For 
compensation, an organic silicon polymer is added for 
impregnation after the nitridation and the sintering is 
conducted under a non-oxidation atmosphere. As a result, 
the change to TiO₂ which is low in thermal conductivity is 
prevented and the resultant ceramic becomes high in density 
since its porous regions having been closed, thus 
increasing the thermal conductivity. Also, when a reaction sintered ceramic of silicon 
nitride is produced from a mixture of Si, Y₂O₃, Al₂O₃, and 
Ti, it is a good idea to add silicon carbide (SiC) and 
aluminum nitride (AlN) to increase the thermal 
conductivity. In the drawings: Fig. 1 is a flowchart diagram illustrating a method of 
the present
