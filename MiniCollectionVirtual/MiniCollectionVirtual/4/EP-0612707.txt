<ABSTRACT>
An alkyl-aromatic compound is selectively 
photochlorinated in the side chain in a cyclic reaction 

system wherein said compound is continuously circulated 
between a container (1) and photochlorination reactor (2). 
The compound is partially chlorinated after each 
passage through the photochlorination reactor (2), the 

number of passages depending on the degree of 
chlorination required. 
The procedure is particularly useful for the 

preparation of benzyl chloride, benzal chloride and 
benzotrichloride, and the corresponding halogen-substituted 

derivatives of the nucleus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a procedure for the
selective photochlorination in the side chain of alkyl-aromatic
compounds.It is known that the chlorination in the side chain of
alkyl-aromatic compounds is generally favored by raising
the reaction temperature or, more commonly, by
operating in the presence of free radical initiators such
as light radiation or peroxides.Particularly known in the art is the chlorination in
the side chain of toluene, and its chlorine-substituted
derivatives in the nucleus, to benzyl chloride, benzal
chloride and benzotrichloride. These compounds are
useful intermediates which can be transformed into
other chemical products, especially by reactions involving
chlorine substituents in the side chain. In this way
benzyl chloride can be used in the production of benzyl
butyl phthalate, a plasticizer for vinylic resins, benzal
chloride can be hydrolyzed to benzaldehyde and benzotrichloride
can be transformed into benzoyl chloride. In
addition also some chlorine-substituted derivatives in
the nucleus of the above compounds have a commercial
value; for example p-chlorobenzotrichloride is an
important intermediate in the production of dinitroaniline
weed-killers.The basic problem related to procedures for the
thermal and photochemical chlorination of alkyl-aromatic
compounds consists in the limited selectivity of
the desired reaction product. For example in the production
of benzyl chloride there is normally only a partial
conversion of the toluene, in order to minimize the formation
of products with a degree of chlorination which is
higher than that required. The same happens in the production
of benzal chloride. Finally in the preparation of
benzotrichloride, the product with a higher degree of
chlorination in the side chain, the selectivity of the reaction
is reduced by the presence of by-products. All of
this involves difficult operations for the separation and
purification of the useful products and for recycling the
unaltered reagents.With respect to the known photochlorination methods
of organic compounds, either batch or continuous,
basically two types of reactors are used and more specifically:
a vessel reactor with one or more immersed
lamps and a film reactor with an internal lamp. In the traditional
vessel reactors the stirring which is necessary
to allow the chlorine to flow near the lamps and the
organic compound to be effectively exchanged, is provided
by bubbling the chlorine itself and hydrochloric
acid which is developed as a reaction by-product. This
causes a
