<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to provide a new installation for fighting fire, which is effective in restricting damages caused by smoke generation. A sprinkler (6) or a spray head is arranged in or at an air passage (7) in such a way that when the spinkler is activated it creates a suction from the fire space (1) into the air passage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an installation for fighting fire, comprising at
least one sprinkler or spray head in connection with a monitored space, said at least one
sprinkler or spray head being arranged upon activation to create a suction out of the
monitored space by spraying liquid
at a high drive pressure
in the form of small droplets, like a fog, and thereby
suck smoke from the monitored space, wherein said at least one sprinkler or spray head
is arranged in an opening into the monitored space.US-A-5014790 discloses a fire fighting apparatus in which extractors driven by
a compressed air supply are used to suck noxious fumes from the region of the fire. The
extractors are separate from the spray nozzles and exhaust into a common extraction
duct.US-A-4986364 discloses a fine fighting and ventilation apparatus which is
mounted in an opening in a building such as a window or doorway. The apparatus
comprises a conduit having a nozzle at one end which in use is directed to spray a liquid out of the
opening in order to draw smoke and other heated gases from the region of the fine
through the opening. A major problem with this apparatus is that the installation work
must be done at the site of the fire. Time consuming installation is, of course,
disadvantageous when fighting fire. Furthermore, the installation of the apparatus may
be very difficult, if not impossible, to carry out in the event of a fine.US-A-4779801 discloses an apparatus for removing smoke and gases from a
burning building, and operates broadly in the same manner as the apparatus of US-A-4986364.
This apparatus is installed alter a fine has broken out, and installation can -
depending upon the type of building - be very difficult. This is the case especially in
tall buildings such as hotels and the cabins of ships.In most kinds of fine the generation of smoke causes extensive damage and loss
of human life, especially in fines in apartments, hotel rooms and ship cabins.The aim of the invention is to provide a new installation for fighting fine, which
better than earlier known installations is capable of restricting the damage caused by
smoke generation.The installation according to the invention is mainly characterised in that said 
opening is an opening of an air passage which is in communication with at least one
further opening into the monitored space so that said at least one sprinkler or spray head
when activated, produces a suction from the monitored space into said air passage.Such sprinklers or spray heads are presented in

<CLAIMS>
Installation for fighting fine, comprising at least one sprinkler or spray head
(6;33;45;55;62;72;82;92;103;143;153;163;172;182) in connection with a monitored space

(1;30;40;50;60;70;80;90;140;150;160), said at least one sprinkler or spray head being
arranged upon activation to create a suction out of the monitored space by spraying

liquid
at a high drive pressure

in the form of small droplets, like a fog, and thereby suck smoke from the
monitored space, wherein said at least one sprinkler or spray head is arranged in an

opening (8;58) into the monitored space, characterised in that said opening is an opening
of an air passage (7;12;19;34;46;57;63;73;101,102;105,106;142;152;162;173;183) which

is in communication with at least one further opening (9;35;59;64,65;74,75) into the
monitored space so that said at least one sprinkler or spray head

(6;33;45;55;62;72;82;92;103;143;153;163;172;182) when activated, produces a suction
from the monitored space into said air passage.
Installation as claimed in claim 1, wherein said at least one sprinkler or spray
head is governed by a smoke detector.
Installation as claimed in claim 1, comprising at least one sprinkler
(6;33;45;55;62) which is an automatically releasable sprinkler for spraying extinguishing

liquid into the monitored space (1;30;40;50;60).
Installation as claimed in claim 1, wherein said air passage (57;63) is located
between a lower ceiling (56;61) and an upper ceiling.
Installation as claimed in claim 1, wherein said air passage (73) is located under
the floor (71).
Installation as claimed in claim 1, comprising a sprinkler (6) and wherein said
air passage (12) is in communication with a ventilation duct (13) provided with a fire

damper (14) which is arranged to close the ventilation duct when the sprinkler is 
activated.
Installation as claimed in claim 1, wherein said air passage (19) is in
communication with a ventilation duct (20), a guide plate (21) being arranged at the

branching from the ventilation duct to said air passage in order to prevent ventilation air
from flowing into the air passage in a normal state and to allow such a flow upon a fire

in the monitored space (1).
Installation as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, wherein a filter (10) is disposed
in said air passage (12), preferably in said at least one further opening (9).
Installation as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8, in particular for fighting fires in
comparatively restricted spaces, such as hotel rooms and ship cabins, wherein said at

least one further opening (9) of said air passage (7;12;19) is positioned in the ceiling of
the space (1) near a door (3) leading out thereof.
Installation as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in particular for ship cabins and hotel
rooms, wherein a spray head (45) is mounted in a toilet wall (42) to create a suction

from the cabin or room (40) into the toilet (41).
Installation as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, in particular for larger spaces,
such as a car deck (30) in a ship, comprising a plurality of spray heads (33), wherein

each spray head is preferably arranged at an opening of an air passage (34) preferably
common to a number of said plurality of spray heads.
Installation as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein a spray head (92;143;153;163),
is arranged to create a suction from the monitored space (90;140;150;160) into the open

air.
Installation as claimed in claim 1, wherein a spray head (172;182) is arranged to
create a suction from the monitored space into an air passage (173;183) leading to a 

ventilation duct (170;180), the liquid droplets being arranged to hit an air passage
element (175;185) for recovering liquid into a drain pipe (176;186) or the like.
