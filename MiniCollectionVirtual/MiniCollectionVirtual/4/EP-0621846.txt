An apparatus for wrapping meat products with an 
elastic material, the apparatus having a device which 

spreads the elastic wrapping and holds it open and 
further having as a component of the latter device a 

fixed support (4) for the meat product (5) to be 
wrapped, 
characterized in that
 the cross-sectional 
extent of the spreading and holding-open device 

corresponds approximately to the inside extent of the 
slack elastic material (2) and that allocated to said 

support (4) is a spreader (6) which is variable in 
distance from the support from an initial position at 

least in the vicinity of the support (4) to a maximum 
spreading position and is provided with a drive (10). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the support (4) takes the form of a trough-shaped 

pan connected at a narrow end to a mount and 
the spreading element (6) is formed by at least one 

rod, preferably a substantially U-shaped bow closed 
at the free end thereof. 
A device as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that 
the mount is essentially formed by a mounting plate 

(3) arranged substantially vertically, and attached 
approximately at right angles thereto and in spaced 

relationship to the lower supporting side of the 
mounting plate is the trough-shaped pan, and that a 

slide (7) with spreader (6) attached thereto is  
 

provided mounted on the mounting plate so as to be 
vertically slidable. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 3, characterized in 
that the slide (7) is connected to a manual drive, 

preferably a toggle lever system (10) having an 
operating lever (11). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 4, characterized in 
that the toggle lever system (10) has a driving crank 

(12) mounted preferably centrally in the upper end 
zone of the mounting plate (3), the crank end thereof 

being rotatably acted upon, via a crank pin (25), by 
a draw lever (13) whose other end is connected to the 

slide (7). 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 5, 
characterized in that the slide (7) is provided with 

a slot oriented at right angles to the direction of 
movement or is provided with a similar guide element 

for engagement with the crank pin (25). 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 6, 
characterized in that the slide connected to the 

spreader (6) takes the form of a slide plate (7) 
slidably resting on the mounting plate (3) and that 

the plates are interconnected by way of a sliding 
guide. 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 7, 
characterized in that the mounting plate (3) has an 

opening (14) therethrough for a meat product (5) to 
be wrapped, that the trough-shaped pan (4) is fitted 

adjoining the opening on the one side of the mounting 
plate, and that adjoining the opening on the other  

 
side of the mounting plate there may be a preferably 

trough-shaped feed tray (15). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 8, characterized in 
that the slide plate (7) has a cutaway portion in the 

region of the opening through the mounting plate (3). 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 9, 
characterized in that the sliding guide takes the 

form of longitudinal slots (8) oriented in the 
sliding direction provided in one of the two plates 

and flange bolts (9) or the like provided in the 
other plate and engaging with the longitudinal slots. 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 9, 
characterized in that the sliding guide takes the 

form of interlocking formations provided at the edges 
of the slide plate and mounting plate preferably in 

the form of sheet metal plates. 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 11, 
characterized in that at the bottom side the mounting 

plate (3) has a bend (19) as supporting plate and 
that at least one clamp-like fastening bow (21) is 

provided for connecting the mounting plate (3) to a 
base. 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the spreader (6), when 

configured in the shape of a finger or a plurality of 
fingers, is lowerable at least under the upper side 

of the meat product (5) to be wrapped, or, when 
configured in the shape of a U-bow, is lowerable as 

far as or under the supporting level formed by the 
trough-shaped pan (4).  

 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in that the spreader is arranged 

approximately parallel to the fixed support (4) or 
slantwise thereto at a distance diminishing towards 

the free end.
