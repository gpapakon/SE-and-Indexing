<ABSTRACT>
This invention is provided with a furnace 
body (2) having a bottom electrode (1) at a lower 

portion thereof, a furnace cover (3) provided so as to 
close an upper
 portion of the furnace body (2), a raw 
material inlet port (25) formed in the substantially 

central portion of the furnace cover (3), and two 
upper electrodes (26, 27) so as to vertically pass 

through the portions of the furnace cover (3) which 
are laterally on both sides of the raw material inlet 

port (25). A raw material consisting of scrap is fed 
continuously from the raw material inlet port (25), 

and an arc is directed to the scrap in the central 
portion of the furnace body (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a DC arc furnace for melting scrap or pig iron
in cold block form (hereinafter referred to as scrap material).A DC arc furnace for melting scrap material is known which has the
construction illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings which
are a front sectional view and a side sectional view, respectively, of the known
furnace.The furnace comprises a furnace shell 2 with a lower electrode 1 (anode) at its
bottom, a furnace roof 3 adapted to close the upper portion of the furnace shell
2, an upper electrode 4 (cathode) extending vertically through the roof 3 at the
centre thereof a dust collecting duct 5 connected to the roof 3, a device 6 for
opening and closing the roof 3, which supports the roof so as to be vertically
and pivotally movable and a device 7 for raising and lowering the upper
electrode 4, which is mounted on the roof opening and closing device 6.The furnace shell 2 is rockably supported via a rocker 9 by a lower supporting
stand 8. When the roof 3 is released, the furnace shell 2 may be tilted by a
tilting drive 10 to pour molten steel 11 in the furnace shell 2 out through a spout
12 into a ladle 14 on a ladle carriage 13.When melting scrap material 15, the roof opening and closing device 6 lifts up
the roof 3 and swings it outwardly of the furnace shell 2, thereby opening the
top of the furnace shell 2. The scrap material 15, which has been preheated by a
preheating device (not shown), arranged at a separate position, is charged into
the furnace shell 2 by means of a bucket or the like . The top of the furnace
shell 2 is then reclosed with the roof 3. A reduced pressure is then produced in 
the furnace shell 2 by the dust collecting duct 5 and the upper electrode 4 is
lowered to a predetermined position and the electrodes 1 and 4 are energized to
generate and maintain an arc 16 to melt the scrap material 15.However, the weight of the scrap material 15 is small in comparison to the
quantity thereof and a desired quantity of molten cannot be obtained in only one
melting operation. Therefore, after the completion of one melting operation, the
electrodes 1 and 4 are de-energized, the furnace roof 3 is opened and further
scrap material is charged into the furnace shell 2. Thus, the scrap material
melting operation is repeated several times in the manner described above.
Thereafter, the furnace shell 2 is tilted by the drive 10 to pour the molten metal
11 through the spout 12 into the ladle 14.In the DC arc furnace of the type described above,

(3) adapted to close the upper portion of the furnace shell (2), a material
charging port (25) situated substantially at the centre of the furnace roof

(3), two upper electrodes (26,27) situated laterally opposed to one
another on opposite sides of the material charging port (25) and

extending vertically through the furnace roof (3), a material preheating
and charging device (35) which is situated above the material charging

port (25) and communicates with it and in which the material is
preheated, an exhaust system (37) arranged to draw exhaust gas from the

furnace shell (2) through the material charging port (25) and the material
preheating and charging device (35) and a material charging device (40)

for moving the material from the material preheating and charging
device (35) through the material charging port (25) into the furnace shell,

characterised in that the material preheating and charging device (35)
comprises a packed bed type heat exchanger and is situated laterally

offset from the material charging port (25) and that the material charging
device (40) is arranged to push material out of the material preheating

and charging device (35) and through the material charging port (25)
substantially continously.
