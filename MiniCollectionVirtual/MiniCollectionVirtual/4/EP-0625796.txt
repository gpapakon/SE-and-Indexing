<ABSTRACT>
In order to remove oxide film and contamination film on 
members to be bonded by soldering and solder material 

therefor correspondingly to variation of thickness thereof 
by sputter-etching in a fluxless bonding method and 

apparatus therefor, substance emitted from the solder 
material under sputter-etching using atom or ion is detected 

and determined whether it is from the solder material or 
from the oxide film thereon. The sputter-etching is 

controlled on the basis of the determination to remove the 
oxide film. Then, the members are aligned in oxidizing 

atmosphere and soldered in non-oxidizing atmosphere.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an
apparatus for fabricating an electronic circuit device and
particularly, to a fluxless soldering method and apparatus
for soldering at least two different materials or members of
such circuit devices.When two different materials or members are to be
soldered together, it is usual to use flux or cream solder
or solder paste containing flux to remove oxide films formed
on surfaces of such members, maintain these surfaces clean
by preventing oxidation thereof and promote wettability of
solder on these surfaces. However, when such flux or flux-containing
cream solder is used, there is a tendency of void
generation due to evaporation of flux in soldering
operation, which causes strength and hence reliability of
soldered junction to be lowered.Further, in such conventional technique, there is an
environmental pollution problem, particularly, such as
destruction of ozone layer, due to removal of flux since
flux must be washed out by using organic solvent such as
chloric solvent or freon after the soldering is completed. 
Further, it is very difficult to completely wash out flux
although not impossible.In order to solve such problem, various soldering
methods requiring no flux have been proposed. For example,
Japanese Patent Application Laid-open (Kokai) Nos. S58-3238
and H3-171643 with corresponding family member US-A-5 090 609 disclose methods each of which comprises the
steps of setting a member carrying solder bumps or solder
balls and a member having bonding pads or bonding faces,
removing oxide films and/or contamination on surfaces of the
solder balls and the pads by irradiating them with ion beam,
aligning these members and bonding them by heating and
melting the solder balls, all of these steps being performed
in vacuum. In another example disclosed in Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open (Kokai) No. H3-241755, contamination
layers and oxide layers on surfaces of members to be bonded
together and solder balls are removed by sputter-etching
with atom or ion. Then, these members are aligned in an
oxidizing atmosphere and solder bumps are melted by heating
to achieve the bonding.In these conventional methods, since the sputter-etching
step is performed while estimating time necessary to
remove oxide film on solder balls, it is impossible to
remove the oxide films on the surfaces of the solder balls
correspondingly to actual thickness thereof. Further, in the
former two methods in which all of the steps are performed 
in vacuum, the workability and
