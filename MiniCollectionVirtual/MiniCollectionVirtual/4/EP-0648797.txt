<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of a low-corrosive 
poly(arylene sulfide), in which a poly(arylene sulfide) is 

subjected to an organic acid treatment in a liquid mixture 
composed of an organic solvent and water in a weight ratio 

ranging from 4:1 to 1:10, and containing an organic acid in 
a concentration of 0.1-5.0 wt.%, and the thus-treated 

poly(arylene sulfide) is then thoroughly washed, is 
provided. The poly(arylene sulfide) obtained by the process 

of the invention has high crystallization speed and

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
production of a poly(arylene sulfide) high in 
crystallization speed and low in corrosiveness, and more 
particularly to a process for the production of a 
poly(arylene sulfide) which is good in molding and 
processing ability owning to its high crystallization 
speed, and exhibits inhibited corrosiveness to metals 
making up molds, processing machinery, metal parts of 
inserts and the like. Poly(arylene sulfides) (hereinafter abbreviated as 
"PAS resins") such as poly(phenylene sulfide), 
poly(phenylene ketone sulfide) and poly(phenylene sulfone 
sulfide), which have both arylene groups and sulfide 
groups in their molecular chains, are engineering plastics 
excellent in heat resistance, mechanical properties, 
chemical resistance, flame retardance, electrical 
properties, molding and processing ability, and the like, 
and used in wide fields such as electrical and electronic 
equipments and parts, automotive machine parts, and 
chemical equipments and parts.  The PAS resins are resins relatively high in 
crystallization speed among thermoplastic resins and hence 
suitable for use in molding and processing such as 
injection molding. However, it is desired that their 
crystallization speed be more accelerated for the purpose 
of permitting the reduction of a molding cycle, the 
lowering of a mold temperature and the like. On the other 
hand, the PAS resins tend to form corrosive gases such as 
sulfur dioxide when heated to an elevated temperature, and 
hence involve problems that metallic portions of 
processing machines, molds and the like are corroded upon 
their molding and processing, or metal contacts, metal 
parts of inserts and the like in molded products are 
corroded. There is thus a demand for inhibiting their 
corrosiveness. Various methods or processes have heretofore been 
proposed for accelerating the crystallization speed of the 
PAS resins. For example, it has been proposed to add an 
additive such as a plasticizer to a PAS resin (U.S. Patent 
No. 5,057,264). However, this method has involved a 
problem of corrosiveness attributable to the generation of 
gases derived from the additive, or deterioration in the 
mechanical properties and heat resistance of the PAS resin 
due to such an additive. There have also been proposed a 
process in which a high-boiling organic acid or organic 
acid anhydride is added to a PAS resin to heat the  
 
mixture, thereby obtaining a PAS resin composition having 
easy crystallizability (U.S. Patent No.
