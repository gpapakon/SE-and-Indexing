<ABSTRACT>
A formulation for use in the controlled generation of phosphide comprises an intimate mixture of a particulate phosphide and a water-immiscible compound, the mixture having the consistency of an extrudable paste or a thick slurry. The phosphide, which is preferably aluminium phosphide or magnesium phosphide, comprises from 65 to 85 per cent (by weight) of the formulation. The water-immiscible compound is preferably paraffin oil, petroleum jelly, or mixture of these materials. A surfactant may be included in the formulation. Such a formulation (21, 41) can be held in a cartridge (20, 40) and added progressively to water (13, 33) in a reaction chamber (10, 30). Alternatively, the formulation can be packaged in a water-impermeable container from which a region can be removed to expose the formulation to water vapour in a gas flowing past the container. The water (13, 33) or the water vapour removes or diffuses through the water-immiscible compound from the formulation, then reacts with the phosphide to form phosphine. The phosphine, mixed with a carrier gas (usually air), may be fed into a duct (15, 55, 66) connected to a grain silo, for fumigation of grain stored in the silo.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns the controlled production of
phosphine. More particularly, it concerns formulations for
use in the generation of phosphine, and phosphine
generators using such formulations. Such generators are
particularly suited for use in the fumigation of grain and
similar products stored in bulk, but the phosphine
generating method and apparatus of the present invention
are not limited to that purpose.Phosphine (PH3) is a preferred gaseous fumigant for stored
grain and similar particulate foodstuffs because any
residue of the fumigant will be lost or oxidised to a
harmless phosphate when the grain or other foodstuff is
processed to produce a food. Recent examples of the
fumigation of grain with phosphine are described in the
specification of International patent application
No PCT/AU90/00268 (which is WIPO Publication
No WO 91/00017).The phosphine used to fumigate a grain silo or other
storage may be supplied by cylinders which contain
phosphine or (more usually) a mixture of phosphine and
carbon dioxide. Alternatively, the phosphine may be
produced by on-site generators in which phosphine is
produced by the reaction of water or water vapour with a
metal phosphide (typically aluminium phosphide or magnesium 
phosphide). However, the more traditional technique for
disinfacting a grain silo or the like with phosphine
involves the use of a probe to position formulations of
aluminium phosphide or magnesium phosphide within the grain
mass, where moisture in the air circulating through the
grain reacts with the phosphide to generate phosphine. A
modification of this technique involves the placement of
pellets of a metallic phosphide in the head space of a
grain silo. The phosphine produced when the phosphide
reacts with moisture in the atmosphere above the grain is
circulated through the stored grain either by the natural
convection currents that are present in the silo or by
active recirculation of air from the head space through the
grain using recirculation ducts. Examples of this approach
are described in the specifications of US patents
Nos 4,200,657 (to J S Cook) and 4,756,117 (to W Friemel).
Such techniques, however, cannot be guaranteed to supply
phosphine to all regions of the bulk stored grain to
eradicate weevils and other unwanted grain pests. In
addition, when these traditional techniques are used, there
is no control over the concentration of phosphine in the
grain after the phosphide formulation has been added, and
there is no possibility of regulating the phosphine
concentration/tim
