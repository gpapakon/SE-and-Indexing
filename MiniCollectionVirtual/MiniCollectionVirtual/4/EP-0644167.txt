<ABSTRACT>
Match head formulations suitable for the production of 
safety matches in which chromium compounds, sesqui-based 

phosphorus compounds, sulphur compounds and oxides of zinc 
are absent. 

Instead those match head formulations contain amorphous phosphorus in 
combination with potassium chlorate, the balance being made up of a 

binder, a thickener, a filler, and a foaming agent. The amorphous 
phosphorus is present in the range from 0,5 to 2,0 percent dry weight. 

These formulations are environmentally friendly both in 
manufacture and use. 
Environmentally friendly match head formulations which may 
be brightly coloured are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to match head formulations
suitable for the production of safety matches and to matches when
coated with the said formulations.For many years match head formulations have contained
chromium compounds, phosphorus sesquisulphide, sulphur
and/or sulphur compounds and zinc oxide. These compounds
are now widely recognised as having undesirable
environmental properties both in relation to the
manufacture of such formulations and in relation to their
use and it is therefore an object of the present invention
to provide a match head formulation in which these
compounds are substantially absent.One type of match in common use has a match head
formulation which is ignited by an abrasive contact with
any suitable roughened surface. These are referred to as
`strike anywhere' matches. A second type of match in common
use has a match head formulation which is ignited by an
abrasive contact with a surface containing a formulation
for initiating ignition of the match head. These are
referred to as `safety matches'. According to the present invention there
is provided a match head formulation suitable for the
production of safety matches containing potassium chlorate
and red amorphous phosphorus, the balance comprising a
binder, a thickener, a filler, and a foaming agent to the
exclusion of sulphur, zinc oxide and dichromates, said
formulation being dispersed in water forming a wet
composition
characterised in that the amount of red
phosphorous is within the range 0.5 to 2.0 % by weight and
when in the form of a wet composition the formulation has
a density of approximately 1.15 g/cm3. Preferably the proportion of potassium chlorate
present is in the range from 40 to 60 percent dry weight
while the amorphous phosphorus is present in proportions
ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 percent dry weight - too little and
the match is hesitant while too much and the match is able
to be struck anywhere. Gelatine may provide a
suitable binder if present in proportions ranging from 3 to
12 percent dry weight or alternatively the binder may be in
the form of animal glue. The thickener is preferably a
starch present in proportions of up to 5 percent dry weight
while the foaming agent may be Arylan PWS an amine salt of
an alkyl aryl sulphonic acid present in proportions of up
to 0.2 percent dry weight. Felspar may be chosen
as the filler. The formulation may also include an ash
improver such as infusoria in proportions of up to 6
percent dry weight or a cellulose flour such as olivestone
flour in proportions of up
