<ABSTRACT>
A washing machine drain pump has a tubular inlet (13) 
which tapers inwardly in the direction of fluid flow (F) into 

the pump. A plurality of slots (16) extend along the inlet 
(13) in the direction of fluid flow (F) such that any coin 

entrained in the fluid flow, and of a diameter within a 
predetermined range, will become lodged with opposite edge 

portions thereof in spaced-apart slots (16) and in a plane 
which extends substantially in the direction of fluid flow (F), 

so that this coin will not obstruct the flow passage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a trap device, for trapping
coins entrained in the outflow of a washing machine.Coins and other foreign objects can sometimes be
introduced accidentally into washing machines, and can then jam
or block the drain pump of the washing machine if they get
drawn into the outlet pipe. When the drain pump becomes jammed
or blocked in this manner, the owner usually has to call out
an engineer to rectify the fault: this is inconvenient and
expensive, and reflects on the perceived reliability of his
machine.Filters can be fitted to prevent the drain pump
becoming jammed or blocked in this way. However these filters
become clogged and can block the pump unless they are cleaned
regularly. Many washing machine manufacturers therefore prefer
not to fit such filters to their washing machines.British Patent Specification No. 1 346 571 discloses a
washing machine drain pump having a tubular inlet which tapers
inwardly in the direction of flow of water into the pump.
Coins entrained in the flow of water become trapped by the
tapering inlet and will be prevented from entering the pump.
These coins lodge across the tapering inlet, either directly
across or at an angle e.g. greater than 45° to the direction
of flow, and therefore three elongate ribs are provided on the
tapering inlet to hold the coins away from its wall and ensure
that a small passage remains around the coins for the flow of
water. However, the coins still lodge across the inlet and
severely restrict the flow of water out of the washing machine
during the rest of the operating cycle. At the end of that
cycle a small amount of water is arranged to backwash through
the pump, and this usually dislodges any coins trapped in the
inlet. These dislodged coins drop into a small sump provided
in front of the pump: in practice however, the coins do not
always dislodge and those that remain severely restrict the
flow of water on successive cycles of the machine.We have now devised a trap device which alleviates the
above-mentioned problems, and therefore increases the overall 
reliability of the appliance to which it is fitted.In accordance with this invention there is provided a
device for trapping coins entrained in the outflow of a washing
machine, said device comprising a flow duct which tapers in the
direction of fluid flow, said flow duct being formed with a
plurality of slots which extend along the duct in the direction
of fluid flow, characterised in that said flow duct is formed
with at least six said slots such that any coin which

A device for trapping coins entrained in the outflow of
a washing machine, said device comprising a flow duct which

tapers in the direction of fluid flow (F), said flow duct being
formed with a plurality of slots (16) which extend along the

duct in the direction of fluid flow (F), characterised in that
said flow duct is formed with at least six said slots (16) such

that any coin which is entrained in the fluid flow, and is of
a diameter within a predetermined range, will become lodged

with opposite edge portions thereof in spaced-apart said slots
and in a plane which extends substantially in the direction of

fluid flow (F).
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that
it is arranged such that coins at least within a diameter of

20 to 26mm will lodge at an angle of less than 25° to the
direction of fluid flow (F).
A device as claimed in claims 1 or 2, characterised in
that the width of the slots (16) reduces in the direction of

fluid flow (F).
A device as claimed in any preceding claim,
characterised in that the flow duct is frusto-conical for at

least a major part of its length.
A device as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that
the cone angle of said flow duct is in the range of 30 to 45°.
A device as claimed in claims 4 or 5, characterised in
that the flow duct has a diameter in the range of 26 to 40mm

at its wider, upstream end.
A device as claimed in any of claims 4 to 6,
characterised in that the flow duct has a diameter in the range

of 15 to 25mm at its narrower, downstream end.
A device as claimed in any preceding claim, 
characterised in that said flow duct is formed with six to ten

said slots (16).
A device as claimed in any preceding claim,
characterised in that said slots (16) are of a substantially

uniform depth along the length of the flow duct.
A device as claimed in claim 9, characterised in that
said slots (16) are formed by a plurality of elongate ribs (15)

formed on a frusto-conical surface of said flow duct.
A device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that the slots (16) progressively deepen, in

the direction of fluid flow (F), but are closed at their
downstream ends.
A washing machine pump having an inlet which includes
a device for trapping coins entrained in the outflow of the

washing machine, characterised in that said device comprises
a device as claimed in any preceding claim.
