<ABSTRACT>
Method for on-line process control of yarns wound upon reels 
intended for yarn package classification and sorting into 

homogeneous classes of predetermined quality standards. This method 
consists in the determination of the specific weight of the yarn 

bundling on the reel. This value is utilized to check the yarn 
package compliance with preset standard values of the technological 

properties, in particular of the dyeing affinity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method for on-line process control of 
yarns packages i.e. yarn wound upon reels, employing highly 
automated instruments, in which the analytical data storage and 
processing for product evaluation are carried out by a preset 
computer programme. In this description the term "package" means a bundle of yarns 
(plain, twisted, texturized, POY, etc.) wound upon a rigid reel, as 
bobbin, cop, tube, cone. The term "lot" means a product batch obtained from a given raw 
material and through a given production process. The quality control of yarn packages for the selection and sorting 
of same into predetermined classes is at present based on a large 
number of analytical determinations and technological tests, the 
main being the following: 
1) Package weight: determined automatically by mechanical and 
electronic balances;  2) Degree of interlacing (number of knots/metre): obtained by 
automatic (Enka, Microdynamics, Lawson-Hemphill) or manual apparatus 
(vat containing Hâ‚‚O);  3) Gauging: the package external diameter may be determined by 
various methods based on IR, ultrasound laser, or on mechanical or 
manual techniques (gauge and snap gauge);  4) Filament defects and other defects: in general, detected visually 
by the operator; 5) Dyeing affinity: the "sock dyeing" test is largely used. It 
consists in the preparation of a specimen (a sock manufactured from 
various packages by a circular knitting machine) and in the 
subsequent standard dyeing, evaluated by visual control or by 
optical sensors (colorimeter). Another test in use consists in yarn continuous dyeing. The aforesaid tests and analytical determinations require very 
different performance times: in particular, the dyeing affinity test 
("sock dyeing") is time-consuming. It follows that a control 
apparatus for the simultaneous performance of all predetermined 
tests can be hardly implemented. The quality control method envisaged in this invention meant for 
classifying the yarn packages leaving the production plant 
(spinning, texturizing or other) and sorting same into predetermined 
quality classes consists in the analytical determinations and 
technological tests described hereinafter, which are performed by a 
prescribed computer-based operating programme. The computer stores and processes the data detected, and defines the 
classification of the product being examined. The major analytical determinations envisaged by the programme are: 
a) Package weight b) Package external diameter  c) Number of knots/metre

<CLAIMS>
Method for on-line process control of yarns wound upon reels for 
yarn package classification and sorting into homogeneous classes of 

predetermined quality standards characterized by the determination 
of the specific weight of the yarn bundling on the reel and by the 

utilization of the said value to check the yarn package compliance 
with preset standard values of the technological properties, in 

particular the dyeing affinity. 
Method, as per claim 1, envisaging the determination of the 
specific weight from the value of the yarn bundling weight and of 

the package max. external diameter.
