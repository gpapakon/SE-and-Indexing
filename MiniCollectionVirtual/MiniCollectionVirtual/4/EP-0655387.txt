<ABSTRACT>
A working apparatus comprising openings formed as gondola access 
holes in tank web frame of a ship, a rail passed through the openings and 

secured to the tank web frame, a trolley adapted to travel along the rail, a 
hoist mounted on the trolley, and a gondola elevatably suspended from the 

hoist is provided. The working apparatus can transport workers or 
necessary articles to a working place to be inspected or repaired for 

carrying out the inspection and/or repair within tanks of a ship.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a working system for use inside of a bulk of a
ship, which includes a rail system, durably mounted within said ship bulk, and a
working apparatus traveling along said rail system inside of said ship; the
working apparatus comprising a trolley and a drive apparatus.Ships such as a large tanker or a ore carrier for carrying bulk cargo
such as ore or grain are provided with longitudinal bulk head. Fig. 13
shows a left-half cross-section of middle hull portion of a conventional
large tanker. In Fig. 13, a reference numeral "1" denotes a side shell
plating, "2" denotes an upper deck, "3" denotes a longitudinal frame, "4"
denotes a ship's bottom, "5" denotes a longitudinal bulkhead, "6" denotes a
flat, "7" denotes a cargo tank, and "8" denotes a ballast tank.That is, there are provided four longitudinal bulkhead 5 and three
cargo tanks 7 are formed by the four longitudinal bulkhead 5 and both side
shell plating 1. A side shell plating 1 and a longitudinal bulkhead 5
arranged at one side form a ballast tank 8. Each of the side shell plating
1 and the longitudinal bulkhead 5 is provided with longitudinal frames 3
running along a length of the hull for preventing a deflection of the
plating. Flats 6 forming horizontal plating are mounted within the ballast
tanks 8 and used for inspecting the inside of the tanks.In recent years, since damages caused within tanks are increased and 
thus regulations prescribing the detail inspection of inside structures
within tanks are established, it is necessary to provide an inspecting
apparatus not only on newly built ships but on presently working ships.Following methods have been adopted for inspecting inside surfaces
of the side shell plating forming tanks and longitudinal bulkhead.
(1) A first method is a RAFT system wherein the inspection is carried
out by a RAFT (an inflatable boat) floated on water in a tank and
vertically movable by changing the water level; (2) a second method is a
fixed-ladder system wherein the inspection is carried out by using a
ladder secured within a tank; (3) a third method is a temporary scaffold
system wherein the inspection is carried out by using a temporarily
mounted scaffold; and (4) a fourth method is a flat system wherein the
inspection is carried out by using flats 6 (horizontal flats shown in Fig.
13) mounted at a some pitch within each of the starboard side and port
side ballast tanks 8 and ladders permanently or temporarily mounted
between these flats 6.
However, following problems are found in each
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A working system for use inside of a bulk of a ship, which includes a rail system
(11), durably mounted within said ship bulk, and a working apparatus travelling

along said rail system (11) inside of said ship; the working apparatus
comprising a trolley (12) and a drive apparatus (116), 
characterized in that

said working apparatus further comprises a hoist (13, 124) mounted on said
trolley (12), and a gondola (14, 107), elevatably suspended from said hoist (13,

124).
A working system according to claim 1, wherein the drive apparatus (116) of
the trolley (12) comprises a number of wheels (118, 121 and 122) and a

number of pulleys (117, 119) for moving along and parallel to said rail system.
A working system according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said gondola (14, 107) is
detachable from said hoist (13, 124), for enabling the trolley (12) to travel

through small openings (10) inside a bulk frame (9, 16) of a ship.
A working system according to one of the claims 1 to 3, wherein said drive
apparatus (116) is attachable to said rail system (11), which comprises at least

one I-shaped rail, arranged above the traveling way of the working apparatus.
A working system according to one of the claims 1 to 3, wherein said drive
apparatus (116) is attachable to said rail system (3), which comprises two rails

or profiles being arranged vertically above each other and beside the travelling
way of the gondola (107). 
A working system according to claim 5, wherein the rails or profiles of said rail
system (11) are T-shaped or L-shaped.
A working system according to at least one the previous claims 1 through 6,
wherein the working apparatus further comprises a supporting member (112)

for rotatably supporting said traveling wheels (118);

a main member (111) arranged perpendicularly to said supporting member
(112), one end of which is secured to said supporting member (112) and the

other end of which supports a sheave (129);
a vertical member (114), one end of which is secured directly to a bottom
surface of said main member (111) or to a member (113) connected to said

bottom surface near said supporting member (112) and the other end of which
holds a further wheel (122) which can be brought in contact with a rail (3).
