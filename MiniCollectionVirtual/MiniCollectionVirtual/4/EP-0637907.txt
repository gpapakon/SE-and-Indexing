<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an environmentally-friendly and energy-saving animal shed, for instance for pigs. The emission of harmful substances such as ammonia from the shed is considerably reduced by intimately mixing ammonia-containing air from the shed with a washing liquid. The moisture content of the manure can herein also be considerably reduced. Circulation means are further disclosed for feeding and draining washing liquid in a circuit to a manure collection space (4) via an aerating device, in addition to activating means for stimulating the activity of bacteria in the degradation process. Further present is a fresh-air supply and heating system wherein heat exchange takes place between fresh and used air, optionally with interposing of washing liquid. The invention finally provides a processing system for manure with which re-usable manure pellets can be made from the produced manure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for treating discharge air 
from an animal shed and processing washing liquid. The invention further 
relates to an animal shed, for instance  
 
for pigs, comprising at least one accommodation area with at 
least one stall for the animals, which stall communicates 
by means of a grid in the floor of the stall 
with a manure collection space in which a layer of washing 
liquid is contained. The invention thus relates to an 
integrated farm for husbanding animals and for processing 
manure coming from the animals, in addition to a method for 
treating and/or processing manure excreted by animals. In a typical embodiment of an animal shed, for instance 
for pigs, a main or central pathway is usually 
present which gives access via doors to a number of 
accommodation areas for the animals located transversely of 
this pathway. Situated in each of these accommodation areas 
is a substantial number of adjacently located stalls for one 
or a number of animals. Lying along these stalls is usually 
a working passage, for instance for feeding the animals. The excess of manure produced in such often large-scale 
farm buildings for breeding and fattening for instance 
pigs represents a great impact on the environment. The 
manure causes a two-fold problem. On the one hand there is the emission of harmful 
substances such as ammonia from the animal shed itself. 
These substances have an impact on the environment because 
they directly or indirectly cause air pollution and acid 
rain and also disseminate an unpleasant odour. On the other hand the processing of the liquid manure 
is becoming an increasing objection; manure processing 
plants do not have the capacity to process the large 
quantities of liquid manure produced. The processing is 
moreover quite costly. A possible alternative here is the  
 
spreading of liquid manure on farmland. This is however 
subject to legal restrictions intended to prevent 
environmental pollution. The large volume which cannot be 
entirely processed or spread results in a surplus of liquid 
manure with a great environmental impact which no-one knows 
how to deal with, whereas manure in suitable form, for 
instance pellets, can in essence be a useful product, with 
the advantage that it can be transported in suitable manner 
to locations where there is a shortage of manure. It is important to find a method which provides the 
possibility of a substantial, environmentally-friendly 
reduction of the liquid manure volume and thus also of the 
surplus
