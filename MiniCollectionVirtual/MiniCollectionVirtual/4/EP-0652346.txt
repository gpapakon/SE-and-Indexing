<ABSTRACT>
Notches (6, 7), which leave a narrow material web (8, 9) of at least 0.1 mm, are provided, in particular at regular intervals, on the sealing lip of a profiled sealing strip (2) which consists of an elastomeric material and can be inserted, in particular, between a window pane (3) and a frame. According to the invention, said notches make it possible for the sealing strip to be provided around window panes in a continuous progression even in corner regions, without further manipulations, the sealing lip coming to rest smoothly, and without the formation of folds, against the window or door panel, which consists, in particular, of glass.

Extruded seal profile made of elastic or elastomer material
which in particular is insertable between window frame and

window glass (3) and consists of a continuous extrusion
which embraces the window glass in one piece, bears on one

side on the frame shoulder and on the side facing the
window glass (3) exhibits a sealing area extending outwards

and a sealing area extending inwards, the sealing area
extending inwards exhibiting a sealing lip, in particular a

plurality of sealing lips (15a, 15b), or an oval hollow
cross-section (14, 14a), and the sealing area extending

outwards exhibiting at least one sealing lip (1, 2) which
stands at an oblique angle to the window glass and is

provided with incisions at pre-determined, in particular
regular intervals over the entire length of the extrusion,
characterised in that

the incisions are replaced by grooves and notches (6, 7),
respectively, extending into the sealing lip (1, 2) so far

that a continuous material flange (8, 9) remains up to the
free ends (4, 5).
Seal profile according to claim 1,
characterised in that

the remaining material flange (8, 9) is at least 0.1 mm
thick. 
Seal profile according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that

the material flange (9) lies on the side facing the window

glass (3).
Seal profile according to claim 1 or 3,
characterised in that

the material flange (8) lies on the side facing away from
the window glass (3).
Seal profile according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that

the notch (6) ends in a corner (10).
Seal profile according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that

the notch (7) ends running in a curve along an arc (11).
Seal profile according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that

the seal profile is made of an elastomer material with an
IRHD hardness of approximately 40 to 90.
Seal profile according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised by
 production by the co-extrusion or tri-extrusion
method.
