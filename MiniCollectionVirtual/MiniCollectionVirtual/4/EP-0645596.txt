<ABSTRACT>
A gun, i.e. an underwater gun, has a mechanical firing mechanism and 
a trigger safety. The gun fires a harpoon. 
The gun has a trigger (5), a spring (4) operated rocking sear (2), 
and a vertically sliding rod (8) for connecting said trigger (5) with 

said sear (2). The trigger has a screw (11) which is in contact with 
said sliding rod (8). Said screw (11) allows an adjustment of the 

trigger pull. 
INVENTIVE IDEA: create a safety device which condition is made known 
to the user when inserts a finger in the trigger guard. 
SOLUTION: a rocking safety lever (12,112,212) is pivoted on a pin 
(6). In the ON position of said lever is the trigger (5) locked by a 

finger (305) which is in contact with a flat cam surface (212) of the 
safety lever. 
Said safety lever extends into the inner space of the trigger guard 
(7) and can be felt by the trigger finger and moved to the OFF position 

by means of said finger.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a safety catch, in particular 
for underwater guns or the like, comprising moveable means 
for locking the travel of a trigger for activation of means 
of firing a projectile element. In particular, in underwater guns, the conventional 
safety mechanisms which lock the control travel of the 
trigger are produced wuch that activation or de-activation 
thereof must be checked visually by the user. They are 
disposed in the area of the trigger and/or the grip of the 
gun, and thus can only be checked by moving the weapon away 
from the ready-to-fire or aiming position, and by examining 
it. This is a relatively dangerous disadvantage which is a 
potential source of accidents since, depending on the 
circumstances, having initially set the weapon with the 
safety catch activated or deactivated, the user can forget 
this manoeuvre and mistakenly be convinced that the safety 
catch is for example activated when it is not, and vice 
versa. In the first case, obviously it is possible to fire 
accidentally and in a random direction. In the second case 
on the other hand, either it is not possible to shoot the 
spear, or the safety catch is forced and damaged by means of 
violent action of the trigger, also giving rise to ejection 
of the spear.  The object of the invention is to produce a safety catch 
of the type initially described, in particular for 
underwater guns, such that the above-described disadvantages 
can be eliminated by simple, inexpensive and functionally 
safe means. The aforementioned object of the invention is achieved by 
means of a safety catch of the type initially described, 
wich is provided with means for indicating activation 
thereof, and which in the position of locking the travel of 
the trigger, are in a position such that they can be felt 
directly by the hand and/or finger which controls activation 
of the trigger, in the normal position for grasping the grip 
and the trigger. Advantageously, in the position of activating the safety 
catch, the indicating means are superimposed on the side of 
the trigger, and in the area of support of the user's 
control finger. According to a preferred embodiment, the safety catch is 
provided with rotary control means, and it is activated and 
deactivated by means of rotary movement around an axis 
transverse to the direction of travel of the trigger, 
whereas the activation indicating means consist of a 
transverse bar, which is integrally and mechanically 
connected to the means of controlling the safety catch, such

whenever pulled back by a finger of the user of the gun, 
releases the firing device of the gun, said safety catch

catch (12,112,212) is provided with indicating means (14) 
which, whenever said catch (12,112,212) is moved in the said 

first position in which it is locking the travel of the

that they can be felt directly by the finger of the hand of 
the user which controls the activation of the trigger (5), 

in the normal position for grasping the grip of the gun. 
A safety catch (12,112,212) according to Claim 1, 
characterized by the fact that the said indicating means 

(14) consist of an extension piece which is connected 
mechanically to the means (112,212) for locking the trigger 

(5), which extension piece (14) in the said first position 
of the safety catch (12,112,212) is superimposed to the side 

of the trigger (5), and to the area of the trigger (5) 
supporting the finger of the user which controls the trigger 

(5), whereas in the said second inactive position of the 
safety catch (12,112,212) said extension piece (14) is 

disposed in a position in which it does not interfere with 
the access to the trigger (5). 
A safety catch (12,112,212) according to Claim 2, 
characterized by the fact that the means (14) of indicating 

activation of the safety catch (12,112,212) consist of a bar 
transverse to the trigger (5) and to the plane of
