<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for thinning granular starch 
in an aqueous slurry employing a source of peracid without 

using metal catalysts. The thinning process is aimed at 
modifying granular starches by lowering viscosity/increasing 

alkaline fluidity. It can also be employed immediately 
before or during cooking (gelatinization) of starch. Sources 

of peracids are peroxomonosulfuric acid (Caro's acid) or 
organic peracids such as performic, peracetic or perpropionic 

acid. Reaction time and temperature are lower than for 
existing process while product properties are improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
thinning of granular starch. More particularly, the 
invention relates to a process of thinning starch in an 
aqueous slurry employing a source of peracid without using a 
metal catalyst and in obtaining a desired product in a 
shorter reaction time. Native starch, before it can be used in most 
industrial applications, must undergo an extensive chemical 
treatment in order to change its properties for the specific 
use intended. One of the key processes is the degradation of 
starches to obtain a desired viscosity to thereby enable its 
use in a variety of industries, such as wallboard binders, 
paper and board production, textile sizing, production of 
food and food additives, as well as other uses. Degradation of starch is also called conversion or 
thinning of starch. The starch molecules are split into 
smaller molecules by various measures which shift the 
molecular weight distribution to lower molecular weights and 
lower viscosities. Applied to granular starches, the 
viscosity is modified to obtain more easily desintegratable 
granules. The thinning process results in modified hot paste 
viscosity of starches and starch derivatives, but is not 
targeted at obtaining completely water-soluble starches if  
 
the modified starches are to be stored afterwards as dry 
powder or as a slurry. After the thinning process, the starches are 
filtered, washed and dried or further processed in a wet 
stage or as a slurry. The process can be used, however, as an integrated 
step before or during starch cooking (gelatinization) by the 
industrial end user where the gelatinized or solubilized 
starch, after thinning, is immediately used. The industrial methods which are predominantly used 
today to obtain granular starches after thinning are 
oxidative degradation with hypochlorite and acid hydrolysis, 
mostly with sulfuric acid or HCl. Both methods have major 
disadvantages which are well known to the industry: The 
hypochlorite oxidation and the acid hydrolysis cause major 
pollution in the effluents from starch manufacturing plants 
because of the high salt load and, more importantly, the 
large quantities of dissolved organics which are measured as 
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). A reason for the high effluent 
load in both processes is the very long reaction time of 4-15 
hours at elevated temperatures (up to 60°C) which dissolves 
large quantities of organic materials and reduces the yield 
of the process. Many attempts have been made to alleviate these 
prob
