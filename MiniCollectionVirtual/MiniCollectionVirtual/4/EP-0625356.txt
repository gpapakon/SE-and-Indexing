<ABSTRACT>
A suture as provided with a substantially solid spiroid braid 
construction. The suture exhibits greater flexibility, better hand and 

less chatter and drag than tubular braided sutures of known 
construction. For a given overall suture denier, the number of yarns 

and denier of individual filaments comprising a yarn of the spiroid 
braided suture are related to each other as follows:

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a suture possessing a
solid spiroid braid.Sutures intended for the repair of body tissues
must meet certain requirements: they must be substantially
non-toxic, capable of being readily sterilized, they must
have good tensile strength and have acceptable knot-tying
and knot-holding characteristics and if the sutures are of
the bio-absorbable variety, the bio-absorption of the suture
must be closely controlled.Sutures have been constructed from a wide variety
of materials including surgical gut, silk, cotton,
polyolefins such as polypropylene, polyamides, polyesters
such as polyethylene terephthalate, polyglycolic acid,
glycolide-lactide copolymer, etc. Although the optimum
structure of a suture is that of a monofilament, since
certain materials of construction would provide a stiff 
monofilament suture lacking acceptable knot-tying and knot-holding
properties, sutures manufactured from such materials
have been provided as braided structures. Thus, for
example, sutures manufactured from silk, polyamide,
polyester and bio-absorbable glycolide-lactide copolymer are
usually provided as multifilament braids.Currently available braided suture products are
braided on conventional braider-carriers which travel around
the perimeter of the braider deck to result in a tubular
type braid with the yarns crossing over each other on the
surface of the braid. In the larger sizes, e.g., 5/0 and
larger, the tubular braid, or sheath, is constructed about a
core structure which is fed through the center of the
braider. Known tubular braided sutures, including those
possessing cores, are disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Patent Nos.
3,187,752; 3,565,077; 4,014,973; 4,043,344; and, 4,047,533.Spiroid braided structures perse are known, e.g.,
rope, sash cord and the like, but heretofore have not been
known for use as sutures.As removed from the package, the currently
available tubular braided suture products exhibit one or
more deficiencies. Thus, they tend to be stiff and wiry and
retain a "set" or "memory" such that at the time of use, it
is usually necessary for the surgeon or assistant personnel
to flex and stretch the suture to make it more flexible.
Furthermore, the surfaces of these sutures are perceptibly
rough. Thus, if one passes one's hand or fingers along the
braid, surface irregularities will be readily detected. The
result of this rough surface is that the suture will exhibit
drag or chatter as it is drawn through tissue,
characteristics which militate against smooth, neat, 
accurately placed
