<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a brake or locking device (10) for a baby carriage or dolls pram or the like, in which at least one brake rod (14) protrudes out of a housing (12). The housing (12) has two actuating members (38, 50), which are spaced apart from each other and are connected to each other by means of a connecting lever (54). The connecting lever (54) is mounted in the housing (12) in a manner which allows it to pivot about a pivot axis (56). The first actuating member (38) is provided for adjusting the/each brake rod (14) into the braking or locking position whilst, at the same time, mechanically stressing a spring element (28). The second actuating member (50) serves for releasing the fastening, provided in the braking or locking position, between the first actuating member (38) and the/each brake rod (14).

A brake device or a locking device for a child's or doll's 
pram, a tricycle, a child's car or the like,
 
characterized in that
 
at least one brake rod (14) projects from a casing (12) in a 

first spatial direction, that the casing (12) has two actuating 
elements (38, 50) interspaced from each other which are 

orientated in a second spatial direction perpendicular to the 
first spatial direction, that the two actuating elements (38, 

50) are connected to each other by means of a connecting lever 
(54) which is mounted in the casing (12) for pivoting or tilting 

round a pivot pin (56) provided in its central zone, which pivot 
pin is orientated in a third spatial direction perpendicular to 

the first and to the second spatial direction, and that the 
first actuating element (38) is intended for setting at least 

one brake rod (14) into the braking or stopping position, with 
the simultaneous mechanical stressing of a spring element (28) 

provided between the casing (12) and at least one brake rod (14) 
and that the second actuating element (50) is intended for releasing 

the fixed connection provided in the braking or stopping 
position between the first actuating element (38) and at least 

one brake rod (14). 
A device according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
two brake rods (14) project from the casing (12) which, being 

axially aligned, point in opposite directions. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that
 
the/each brake rod (14) has at its inner end section (18) located 

in the casing (12) a slider element (20) which is designed 
with a wedge face (32) and with an engagement recess (34), and 

that the first actuating element (38) is provided with a wedge 
(36) with engagement projections (42) engaging in the corresponding 

engagement recess (34).  
 
A device according to claim 3,
 
characterized in that
 
the slider element (20) and the associated brake rod (14) are 

connected to each other in an elastically sprung mode by means 
of a spring element (72). 
A device according to one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that
 
the/each spring element (28) is a helical compression spring 

through which there extends the corresponding brake rod (14). 
A device according to claim 5,
 
characterized in that
 
the/each helical compression spring is arranged between an 

internal wall (24) of the casing (12) and the corresponding 
slider element (20). 
A device according to one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that
 
the connecting lever (54) has a bent shape and is designed at 

its two end sections (58) with slots (60) and that a securing 
pin (62) extends through each of the two actuating elements (38, 

50) and through the respectively associated slot (60) in the 
connecting lever (54). 
A device according to one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that
 
the/each brake rod (14) is provided at its free end section (66) 

projecting from the casing (12) with a brake element (68). 
A device according to claim 8,
 
characterized in that
 
the/each brake element (68) is a suction cap (70).
