<ABSTRACT>
Improved methods of using an ion trap mass spectrometer (10) whereby AC voltages supplemental to the AC trapping voltage are used for scanning the trap, for conducting chemical ionization experiments, and for conducting MS experiments, are shown. In one embodiment a broadband supplemental AC voltage is applied to rid the trap of ions above or below a preselected cutoff mass. This is particularly useful in conducting chemical ionization (CI) experiments for eliminating high mass sample ions that are formed when the reagent gas is ionized by electron impact ionization (EI). Likewise, this technique may be used to eliminate low mass reagent ions when conducting an electron impact ionization experiment in the presence of a reagent gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED METHODS OF USING ION TRAP MASS SPECTROMETERSField of the Invention The present invention rebates to methods of using ion trap mass spectrometers("ion traps") by applying supplemental voltages to the trap, and is particularly related to methods of operating ion traps in the chemical ionization mode, and for conducting multiple mass spectroscopy experiments ("MS"").Background of the InventionThe quadrupole ion trap, sometimes referred to as an ion store or an ion trap detector, is a well-known device for performing mass spectroscopy. A ion trap comprises a ring electrode and two coaxial end cap electrodes defining an inner trapping volume. Each of the electrodes preferably has a hyperbolic surface, so that when appropriate AC and DC voltages (conventionally designated "V" and "U", respectively) are placed on the electrodes, a quadrupole trapping field is created. This may be simply done by applying a fixed frequency (conventionally designated "f ') AC voltage between the ring electrode and the end caps. The use of an additional DC voltage is optional. Typically, an ion trap is operated by introducing sample molecules into the ion trap where they are ionized. Depending on the operative trapping parameters, ions may be stably contained within the trap for relatively long periods of time. Under certain trapping conditions, a large range of masses may be simultaneously held within the trap. Various means are known for detecting ions that have been so trapped. One known method is to scan one or more of the trapping parameters so that ions become sequentially unstable and leave the trap where they may be detected using an electron multiplier or equivalent detector. Another method is to use a resonance ejection technique whereby ions of consecutive masses can be sequentially scanned out of the trap and detected. 

 The mathematics of the trapping field, although complex, are well developed. Ion trap users are generally familiar with the stability envelop diagram depicted in FIG. 1. For a trap of a given radius r0 and for given values of U, V and f, whether an ion of mass-to-charge ratio (m/e) will be trapped depends on the solution to the following two equations:-QeU a = * mrQ tύ2 Where Z. is equal to 2πf.Solving these equations yields values of a and q for a given m/e. If, for a given ion, the point (a,q) is inside the stability envelop of FIG. 1, the ion will be trapped by the quadrupole field. If the point (a.q) falls outside the stability envelope, the ion will not be trapped and any such ions that
