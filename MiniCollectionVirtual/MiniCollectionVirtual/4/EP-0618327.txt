<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method for the mechanical refining 
of high consistency lignocellulosic feed material in a 

frustoconical refining zone, by facilitating the backflow 
of steam generated in the refining zone through the 

upstream feed zone which, despite the backflow of steam, 
imparts outward force on the feed material sufficient for 

the material to enter the refining zone and pass 
therethrough, without blockage or flow interruption. This 

is accomplished by providing, immediately upstream of the 
frustoconical refining zone (46), a hybrid feed/grinding 

zone (104), which acts on the wood chips with relatively 
high refining intensity at low refining power, so as to 

reduce the size of the material and outwardly convey the 
material by centrifugal force into the frustoconical 

refining zone against the backflowing steam, but without 
generating steam in the hybrid zone. The hybrid zone 

receives chips from a feed screw (84) which preferably 
rotates at the same speed as the rotor (20) portion of the 

frustoconical refining zone and hybrid zone. The feed 
screw is shaped (e.g., as a ribbon screw) so that the chip 

material is easily "handed-off" to the entry of the hybrid 
zone, while establishing an open channel (166) between the 

chip material and the shaft of the feed screw, for 
conveying backflowing steam away from the hybrid zone. 

First pressure control means (136) are provided in fluid 
communication with the backflow steam channel, for removing 

the backflowing steam from the refiner at a controlled 
pressure, thereby controlling the retention time of the 

material in the frustoconical refining zone (146).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the refining of 
lignocellulosic material, and more particularly, to 
so-called high consistency pulp refining. The technology associated with the refining of 
cellulosic material for paper making purposes, has been 
developed to a high degree of effectiveness in so-called 
"flat disc" refiners. In the past, the performance of such 
machines has been improved by increasing the disc diameter 
and speed of rotation. Increase in size has, however, 
reached practical limits with respect to the material 
integrity of the disc, and the adverse effect of high 
centrifugal forces on the retention time of material as it 
passes radially outward along the disc. In particular, the 
high centrifugal forces acting on the steam generated 
during high consistency refining imparts such high radial 
velocities, as to cause the steam to carry the pulp 
material out of the grinding space before full refining 
action has been completed. Various efforts have been made in recent decades 
to overcome some of these problems. Developments 
represented by U.S. Patent Nos. 4,090,672; 4,238,016; and 
4,253,613 provide a combination of a radially extending and 
inclined refining zones, the latter having a retaining 
influence on the steam, thereby inhibiting the "blow-out" 
effect. In other words, substantially the same total 
refining gap length can be achieved without blow-out, 
relative to flat disc refiners. U.S. Patent No. 4,253,613 discloses a single 
conical refining zone following a single radial refining 
zone, which receives wood chips from a single feed screw of 
solid flight construction. Several deficiencies are 
inherent to this configuration. Having a radial, or flat 
refining zone prior to the conical refining zone impedes 
the free flow of steam backward from the conical refining  
 
zone, due to the forward flowing steam generated in the 
flat refining zone. This forces all the steam in the 
conical zone to flow forward. The flat zone acts as a 
pressure seal to prevent steam generated in the conical 
zone from backflowing into the flat zone. As a result, 
retention time of the material in the conical zone cannot 
be controlled by direct adjustment of the steam pressure 
difference across the conical zone (i.e., by steam flow 
valves). Because the nature of the fiber development in 
the conical zone is so dependent on retention time, fine 
control of retention time would be advantageous. Yet, the 
machine disclosed in the '613 experiences the inherent 
reduction in the
