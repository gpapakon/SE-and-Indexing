<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a package which is suitable 
for mess-free handling, easy pouring and secure storage, 

and which additionally can be easily refilled from a 
lightweight container. 
The refillable package (10) of the present invention 
comprises three elements: 


a. a rigid or semi-rigid container (12) having an 
aperture (80) in its surface for refilling said 

package; 
b. a transition collar (14); and 
c. a closure (16). 
The transition collar covers the aperture and is releasably 
attached to the container in the region around the 

aperture. The transition collar further comprising a 
pouring orifice (50), which is covered by the closure the 

closure being releasably attached to the transition collar 
in the region around the pouring orifice.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a refillable package 
comprising a rigid or semi-rigid container, a transition 
collar; and a closure. Plastic bottles are very widely used as a convenient method 
for packaging products of all types in order to transport 
and store the product throughout the distribution chain, 
from the manufacturers factory to the hands of the ultimate 
consumer. However recent environmental concerns have lead 
manufacturers to look for alternative means of packaging 
that require less plastic. One such approach is to provide the customer with 
lightweight packages. Such a package must still be 
sufficiently strong to protect the product during transport 
and storage up to the point were it reaches the ultimate 
consumer. The package is designed to use little or no  
 
plastic. However a package of this type is usually not 
well-suited to the requirements of the consumer. Such a 
lightweight package may be non-rigid which makes it 
difficult to pour from, or it may have only a rudimentary 
pouring spout, or no spout at all, which tends to result in 
messiness after use. Furthermore it may not be possible to 
reseal the lightweight package after a part of its contents 
have been used, which may result both in product 
deterioration due to exposure in the air, and to the 
increased risk of accidental spillage. Consequently it has been suggested that the consumer should 
be able to purchase a lightweight package and then to 
transfer the product from the lightweight package into a 
refillable, reusable container. Some containers which can be refilled are known in the 
prior art:
 
DE2711591, published on 10th November 1977 discloses a 
sauce bottle having a pouring spout and a cap which seals 
off the spout and the opening from the atmosphere. The 
spout is located on a sealing cover which fits around the 
upper periphery of a container. EPA109704, published on 30th May, 1984 discloses a package 
particularly suited to liquid laundry detergents. The  
 
package comprises a bottle; a transition collar with a 
pouring spout and drain-back feature; and a cap. The 
transition collar is fixed on to the bottle by a set of 
locking teeth and cannot be readily removed. The present invention provides a package which is suitable 
for easy handling, mess-free pouring and secure storage, 
and which additionally can be easily refilled from a 
lightweight container. The refillable package of the present invention gives the 
consumer the benefits of good handling characteristics, and 
at the same time

<CLAIMS>
A refillable package (10) comprising: 

a. a rigid or semi-rigid container (12) having an 
aperture (80) in its surface for refilling said 

package (10); 
b. a transition collar (14); 
c. a closure (16); 
 
the transition collar (14) covering the refilling aperture 

(80) and being releasably attached by means of a first 
screw thread connection to the container (12) in the region 

around the refilling aperture (80); the transition collar 
(14) further comprising a pouring orifice (50); 

the closure (16) covering the pouring orifice (50) and 
being releasably attached by means of a second screw thread 

connection to the transition collar (14) in the region 
around the pouring orifice (50); 

the pouring orifice (50) having an cross-sectional area 
which is less than the cross-sectional area of the 

refilling aperture (80). 
A refillable package according to claim 1 wherein the 
pouring orifice (50) is positioned off-centre on the 

transition collar (14), relative to the axis of symmetry 
which is perpendicular to the plane of the refilling 

aperture (80). 
A refillable package according to either of claims 1 or 
2, wherein the torque required to unscrew the first screw 

thread connection is greater than the torque required to 
unscrew the second screw thread connection. 
A refillable package according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
further comprising a means for positive locking between 

transition collar (14) and container (12), said positive 
locking means providing an audible and / or tactile 

indication that the first screw thread has been fully 
engaged. 
A refillable package according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
further comprising a stop means preventing over-tightening 

of the first screw thread, said stop means being positioned 
such that it maintains the correct orientation of the 

pouring orifice (50) to the container (12). 
A refillable package according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
having a bottom surface on which it is free-standing, and a 

vertical plane of symmetry. 
A refillable package according to claim 6, wherein the 
shape of the pouring orifice (50) is a spout (52) extending 

from the transition collar (14), the ratio of the height of 
the spout to its diameter being less than 1:1, the aligned 

 
angle being less than 30° and the pouring angle being at 

least 20° greater than the aligned angle. 
A refillable package according to claim 6, the container 
(12) having a plurality of side walls, and a means for 

gripping and lifting the container (74, 74a) positioned in 
the side walls having a line of symmetry which is 

essentially vertical; the line of symmetry of the gripping 
and lifting means (74a), a centre line of the refilling 

aperture (80) and a centre line of the pouring orifice (50) 
all lying in the vertical plane of symmetry of the package; 

the centre of the pouring orifice (60) and the line of 
symmetry of the lifting and gripping means (74a) lying on 

opposite sides of the centre line of the refilling aperture 
(80). 
A package (10) according to any of the previous claims 
having a granular product contained therein.
