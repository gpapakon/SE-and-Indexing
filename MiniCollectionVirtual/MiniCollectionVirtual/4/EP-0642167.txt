<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device having ferroelectric 
layer or high dielectric layer as capacitor dielectric layer and a 
manufacturing method thereof. Recently, along with the trend of higher speed and lower power consumption 
of semiconductor device such as microcomputer and digital signal processor, 
electronic appliances for consumer use are more and more advanced in 
performance, while an electromagnetic interference which is an electromagnetic 
noise generated from these electronic appliances is posing a serious problem. 
Accordingly, not only in electronic appliances, but also in semiconductor 
devices used in them, measures against electromagnetic interference are 
demanded The most effective measure against electromagnetic interference in 
the semiconductor device is to install a capacitor of a large capacitance 
between the bias line and ground line inside the semiconductor device, hitherto 
the capacitor was placed outside the semiconductor device.  In addition, lately, nonvolatile random access memories in a simple 
construction having a capacitor, using a ferroelectric layer as capacitor 
dielectric layer, and dynamic random access memories having a capacitor using 
dielectric layer of high dielectric constant as storage capacitor have been 
developed. A conventional semiconductor device having capacitor is specifically 
described below. Fig. 1 is a partially sectional view of a representative semiconductor 
device. In Fig. 1, on a silicon substrate 1, an integrated circuit 6 
represented by source/drain active areas 3, a gate oxide 4, and a gate electrode 
5 is formed in a region enclosed by a field oxide area 2. Further on the 
silicon substrate 1, an insulating layer 7 is formed, and in a specific region 
on the insulating layer 7, a capacitor 11 consisting of a bottom electrode 8, a 
capacitor dielectric layer 9, and a top electrode 10 is formed. At least 
covering the capacitor 11, moreover, an interlayer insulating layer 12 is 
formed. There are also formed interconnections 14a connected to the 
source/drain active areas 3 through a first contact hole 13a, interconnecticn 
14b connected to the bottom electrode 8 of the capacitor 11 through a second 
contact hole 13b, and interconnection 14c connected to the top electrode 10 of 
the capacitor 11 through a third contact hole 13c. Furthermore, a passivation  
 
layer 15 is formed in order to protect the interconnections 14a, 14b, 14c. A manufacturing method of the conventional semiconductor device having
