<ABSTRACT>
A display system comprises a set of substantially 
identical, individually actuable display elements (4) 

arranged side by side. Control means (44) selectively and 
simultaneously actuate a block of adjacent display 

elements, and simulate movement of the block by actuating 
the next (leading) display element (22) in the direction of 

movement and deactuating the trailing element (23) while 
maintaining actuation of display element(s) between the 

leading and trailing display element. The display elements 
are typically defined by an LCD.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a display system such as a 
liquid crystal display (LCD) system. A typical display system is of the kind having a 
number of selectively actuable display elements which can 
be actuated individually to generate a number of different 
display patterns. Such systems are hereinafter referred to 
as of the kind described. In some display systems, it is necessary to simulate 
movement and this is usually achieved by providing a number 
of display elements and actuating them in sequence such 
that as a display element is actuated the preceding one is 
deactuated giving the appearance of movement. Such 
techniques are often used with displays on meters and the 
like but where, in a mechanical equivalent, the movement 
would be continuous (for example due to a continuous change 
in a sensed parameter), conventional displays present a 
discontinuous movement which is often undesirable. An alternative method of producing a moving display is 
shown in GB 1331940. Liquid crystal is disposed between 
sheet electrodes, with the area of the overlap of the 
electrodes defining a single display element. The sheet 
resistance of at least one of the electrodes is arranged to 
vary across the display element. This causes a variation 
in the potential difference between the two electrodes 
across the area of the display element, and as a result 
only discrete sectors within the display element are 
actuated. By varying the voltage of the electrodes, the 
actuated sector can be continuously moved across the 
display element. In accordance with the present invention, a display 
system comprises a set of substantially identical, 
individually actuable display elements arranged side by 
side; and control means for selectively and simultaneously 
actuating a block of adjacent display elements, and for 
simulating movement of the block by actuating the next 
(leading) display element in the direction of movement and  
 
deactuating the trailing element while maintaining 
actuation of display element(s) between the leading and 
trailing display elements. Due to the invention, a much smoother movement of the 
block will be achieved since at each actuation/deactuation 
step a number of the display elements will remain actuated. Preferably, the display elements are arranged close 
together in contrast to known systems in which the display 
elements are often substantially spaced apart. A typical 
separation between adjacent display elements is of the 
order of 0.1mm or less. Preferably, the display elements

<CLAIMS>
A display system comprising a set of substantially 
identical, individually actuable display elements (21) 

arranged side by side; and control means for selectively 
and simultaneously actuating a block of adjacent display 

elements, and for simulating movement of the block by 
actuating the next (22) (leading) display element in the 

direction of movement and deactuating the trailing element 
(23) while maintaining actuation of display element(s) 

between the leading and trailing display element. 
A system according to claim 1, wherein the control 
means deactuates at least one central element (24) of the 

block. 
A system according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein each 
block comprises an odd number of display elements, for 

example 5 or 7. 
A system according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein 
the display elements are arranged partially or completely 

around a circular arc. 
A system according to any of claims 1 to 4, further 
comprising indicia (25) arranged alongside the display 

elements, the indicia defining values of a parameter.

claims wherein the set of substantially identical, 

individually actuable display elements (21) are provided in 
a first display member, the system further comprising a 

second display member (31) having a set of individually 
actuable display elements (53), the first member overlying 

the second member with the elements of the second member 
being laterally offset from the display elements of the 

first member and being visible through the first member. 
A system according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein the display elements are defined by a liquid 

crystal display.
