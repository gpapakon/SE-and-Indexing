<ABSTRACT>
A multiplexing valve is provided having a spool (2) axially movable 
within a valve casing (4) under the control of fluid pressure introduced 

into variable volume chambers (6, 18). The spool has passages (50, 68, 
34a, 34b, 36a, 36b......) formed therein such that, with appropriate 

positioning of the spool, fluid flow communication can be selectively 
established or inhibited between fluid sources (46) and/or sinks (28) and 

a given port (34, 36, 38, 40, 42).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multiplexing valve. Such a valve is
suitable for use within the control system of a gas turbine engine.GB 2 174 824 B describes a control system for a gas turbine engine in
which a multiplexing valve is connected in series with a servo valve
having a single input port so as to selectively supply high pressure air to
any one of a plurality of control valves. This arrangement shows a rotary
multiplexing valve and control valves which are operated on receipt of
successive high pressure pulses, the control valve latching after each
movement. Two electrical actuators are required, to operate the servo
valve and the multiplexing valve.EP 329477 shows a similar system with one electrical actuator the
multiplexing valve being operated in rotary motion.GB 2 156 105A discloses an arrangement in which a piston and cylinder
actuator has a plurality of control lines connected thereto such that the
position of the piston can be selected in accordance with a digital word
applied via the control lines. The piston controls the position of a
multiplexing valve. Once the multiplexing valve has reached a selected
position, enable valves are operated to supply fluid at an appropriate
pressure to an input part of the multiplexing valve.According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
multiplexing valve comprising a valve casing defining N ports where N is
an integer greater than or equal to three, and a first valve member axially 
movable within the casing to a plurality of Jth positions, where J is an
integer between 1 and N-1, inclusive, the Jth position connecting the
(J+1)th port to the first port, characterised by: first and second control
ports for supplying fluid to and/or removing fluid from first and second
variable volumes defined between a first end of the first valve member
and the valve casing, and a second end of the first valve member and the
valve casing, respectively; and a pilot valve arranged to control fluid flow
communication with the first and second variable volumes so as to
control the position of the first valve member and further arranged to
isolate the first port from a source/sink until the first valve member has
reached a selected one of the Jth positions.Preferably the valve further has an N+1th port and the valve member is
further movable to a further plurality of Kth positions, where K is an
integer between 1 and N-1, inclusive, the Kth position connecting
(K+1)th port to the N+1th port.In one embodiment, the valve may have a total of

A multiplexing valve (1) comprising a valve casing (4) defining
N ports (32, 34, 36) where N is an integer greater than or equal to three,

and a first valve member (2) axially movable within the casing (4) to a
plurality of Jth positions, where J is an integer between 1 and N-1,

inclusive, the Jth position connecting the (J+1)th port to the first port
(32), characterised by: first and second control ports (10, 14) for

supplying fluid to and/or removing fluid from first and second variable
volumes (6, 18) defined between a first end of the first valve member (2)

and the valve casing (4), and a second end of the first valve member (2)
and the valve casing (4), respectively; and a pilot valve (160) arranged to

control fluid flow communication with the first and second variable
volumes (6, 18) so as to control the position of the first valve member (2)

and further arranged to isolate the first port (32) from a source/sink (190)
until the first valve member (2) has reached a selected one of the Jth

positions.
A valve as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the first
valve has an (N+1)th port (44) and the first valve member (2) is further

movable to a further plurality of Kth positions, where K is an integer
between 1 and N-1, inclusive, the Kth position connecting the (K+1)th

port to the (N+1)th port.
A valve as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the first
valve member (2) is a spool slidable in substantially fluid sealed

engagement within the valve casing (4). 
A valve as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in that the pilot
valve (160) is further arranged to isolate the first and (N+1)th ports (32,

44) from respective sources/sinks (190, 192) until the first valve member
(2) has reached a selected one of the Jth or Kth positions.
A valve as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the pilot valve (160) further comprises a pilot valve

member (170) for controlling fluid flow communication with the first and
second variable volumes (6, 18), the pilot valve member (170) being

movable to a first pilot valve position at which fluid communication with
the first and second variable volumes (6, 17) is inhibited and at which

fluid communication is provided to the first port (32).
A valve as claimed in Claim 5 when dependent on Claim 2,
characterised in that the pilot valve is further arranged to supply fluid to

the (N+1)th port (44) when the pilot valve member (170) is at the first
pilot valve position.
A valve as claimed in Claim 5 or 6, characterised in that the
pilot valve member is movable to a second pilot valve position to allow

supply of fluid at appropriate pressures to the first and second variable
volumes (6, 18) to move the first valve member (2) in a first direction,

member (2) in a second direction.
A valve as claimed in Claim 7, characterised in that the second
and third pilot valve positions encompass respective ranges of positions

allowing control of rate of fluid flow to the variable volumes (6, 18).
