<ABSTRACT>
A disk drive (10) has a stationary frame and at least one storage 
disk (14) rotatably connected to the frame. An actuator arm (26) is operably 

connected to the frame to move relative to the storage disk (14) and radially 
position a read/write head across the storage disk (14). The disk drive (10) 

further includes a position sensor (50) for detecting absolute radial position of 
the actuator arm (26) across the storage disk (14) and outputting an arm 

position signal indicative of the absolute radial position of the actuator arm (26). 

The position sensor (50) is an optical sensor in its preferred form having a light 
source (52) mounted on the actuator arm (26) and a photosensor (54) attached 

to the stationary frame. The disk drive can also be equipped with a 
displacement sensor (60) for detecting lateral movement of the rotating storage 

disk (14) and outputting a disk displacement signal indicative of the disk lateral 
movement. When both sensors are employed, a processor or other control 

circuitry (70) can determine repeatable and non-repeatable runout 
characteristics of the rotating storage disk (14) based upon the arm position 

signal and the disk displacement signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to computer disk drives. Computer hard disk drives can be generally classified into two 
categories: dedicated servo disk drives and embedded servo disk drives. 
Dedicated servo disk drives have one or more magnetic disks wherein one entire 
surface of a disk is dedicated to storing servo information that is useful in 
controlling and synchronizing the operation of the magnetic disk and read/write 
head. In contrast, embedded servo disk drives have one or more magnetic disks 
wherein each disk has thin "pie-shaped" slices reserved for servo information 
interspersed between larger "pie-shaped" regions for data storage. Conventional disk drives employ a closed loop servo control 
system which depends on position information read from the disk surface(s). In 
order to accurately read the required position information, a high precision timing 
system must be created. The timing system must be capable of both acquiring 
a synchronous operating state with the spinning disk(s) and maintaining that 
mode of operation indefinitely. The timing system supplies critical timing and 
status of both the servo system and the read/write system. The servo 
information used by the timing system has been supplied almost exclusively by 
information provided on an entire disk surface (dedicated disk drive) or 
interspersed about the disks in servo gap regions (embedded disk drives). Although the proportion of space available for data to the space 
reserved for servo information has gradually increased, the servo information still 
occupies a significant percentage of available disk space. Current disk drives 
use 10%-20% of the total storage area for tracking information. Ideally, a 
designer would like to make the entire disk space available for data storage, but 
this is unattainable under present disk drive architectures because servo control 
is effectuated through reading the servo information placed on the disks.  
 
Accordingly, it would be desirable to develop a disk drive that did not require 
any disk-located tracking information or at least substantially reduced the 
amount of tracking information below current levels. Embedded servo disk drives have an added drawback in that the 
servo information is provided on a sampled basis and only during read 
operations. This characteristic is inherent in the drive design because the servo 
information is constrained to the "pie-shaped" regions spaced about the disk. 
The dedicated disk drive overcomes this drawback in that its dedicated surface
