<ABSTRACT>
In a transceiver (1) forming part of a digital communications system, there is described a system for data recovery from the demodulated analogue signal, said system comprising a slicer circuit (6) for extracting the digital data from the analogue signal and a low pass filter (9) for generating, from the input analogue signal (5), a threshold signal for use in the operation of said slicer circuit (6). The low pass filter (9) has a variable time constant, selected by a switch (5), to alter the rate of change of the threshold level in accordance with the position of the switch. The switch is itself controlled by a composite control signal (16) output from a gate (10) and indicative of two properties of the received R.F. signal, namely the received signal strength (RSSI) and the state of synchronisation. The arrangement is such that a high rate of change of threshold level is permitted only if the transceiver is not synchronised a

<DESCRIPTION>
 DC tracking circuit for Ginomy data slicerThis invention relates to a system for data recovery and in particular to a system for extracting binary data from an analogue signal containing such data .Such systems are utilised, for example, in digital communications systems in which digital data is transmitted, which data is a mixture of digitised analogue information and control data, such as synchronising data. At the receiver, such data has to be recovered from the demodulated signal which is, of course, an analogue signal. An example of a transceiver which could utilise such a system is described in our European patent application 0333419 which is incorporated herein by this reference. In the receiver chain of this transceiver, the demodulated signal which is output from the frequency discriminator is filtered, and then passed to a data recovery circuit in the form of a data slicer before being applied as digital data to a data processor.The present invention is essentially concerned with data recovery circuits of this and similar type, although we do not wish to be limited to the particular arrangement shown in EP 0333419, which is presented simply by way of example, for the purpose of explanation.The fundamental purpose of a data recovery circuit is to decide what the smoothly varying analogue input signal represents m binary terms.The simplest technique is to base the decision .?■=■ to whether, at any particular instant of time, a binary 0 or 1 is present on whether the input signal is above or below a predetermined threshold level. The circuit element which carries out such a task is the comparator but because in this application the signal 

is constantly crossing and recrossing the threshold level as the 1 's and O's of the data are received, the comparator is often referred to as a slicer. The slicer is thus the basic component of the data recovery circuit, and its output is a binary signal representing either 0 or 1. More complex systems are known, but the simple slicer system is quite effective.The problem with the slicer system is choice of the optimum slicer threshold level. The threshold level must be able to vary in order to quickly adjust to a freshly acquired signal; on the other hand, the threshold level must not be forgotten too quickly in the event that the input signal fades, or becomes unreliable. There are various ways of providing for a variable threshold level:1 ) The slicer input or output signals may be filtered and thence used to generate a variable threshold level based on a
