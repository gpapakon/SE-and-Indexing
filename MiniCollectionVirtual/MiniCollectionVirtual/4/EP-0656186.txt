<ABSTRACT>
- The meal tray according to the invention includes a support capable of housing, in particular, containers and exhibiting hot and cold regions separated by a slot (9) and connected together by a linking beam (10). - According to the invention, the support is arranged so that the linking beam (10):   . is partly hollowed out in order to be delimited by at least two longitudinal walls (23); . and includes a transverse partition (18) extending between the two walls (23) of the beam, substantially in the area of the slot (9), so as to stiffen the support and to provide thermal insulation between the two regions of the tray.

Meal-tray (2) of the type comprising a support (13, 15) adapted to receive in
particular recipients and presenting hot (12) and cold (11) zones separated by a slot

(9) and joined together by a connecting beam (10),

   characterized in that the support is arranged so that the connecting beam (10):

is partially recessed in order to be delined by at least two longitudinal walls (2
3
),
and comprises a transverse partition (18) extending between the two walls (2
3
) of
the beam, substantially at the level of the slot (9), so as to ensure rigidification of the

support and heat insulation between the two zones of the tray.
Meal-tray according to Claim 1, characterized in that the transverse partition
(18) is rigidified by a reinforcing material (18
1
) presenting a continuous character
and extending on either side of and beyond the partition (18).
Meal-tray according to Claim 1, characterized in that the support (13) is
constituted by a single piece in which recesses (14
1
, 14
2
) are made.
Meal-tray according to Claim 1, characterized in that the support (15) is
constituted by a reinforcement (16) adapted to receive removable recipients (17).
Meal-tray according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized in that the support (13, 15)
is intended to be equipped with a trough (17
1
) partially engaged in the slot (9).
Temperature-control apparatus comprising:

an insulating box (3),
at least one insulating partition (4, 4', 20) for separation, intended to deline, inside
the box, on either side, a cold compartment (5) and a hot compartment (6),
at least one door (7, 7') for closing the insulating box,
and support means (8) for maintaining, in superposed position, meal-trays (2)
according to Claim 1, each engaged in the separation partition via a transverse slot

(9) arranged in the tray which presents a beam (10) for connection between the cold 
(11) and hot (12) parts of the tray, respectively placed in the cold and hot

compartments of the box,

characterized in that the insulating partition comprises, for each means
supporting a meal-tray:


a housing (19) made on the front face (4
1
) of the partition and adapted to
receive a transverse section of the connecting beam (10) of the tray,
an obturator (22) mounted to pivot in order automatically to return from a
retracted position to a free position of closure of the housing (19) to ensure heat

insulation between the cold (5) and hot (6) compartments, the obturator being
placed in the retracted position further to its pivoting ensured by the connecting

beam (10) when the latter is engaged in the corresponding housing.
Apparatus according to Claim 6, characterized in that each obturator (22)
comprises two articulated cheeks (22
1
) established on either side of the insulating
partition and connected together by an actuation crosspiece (22
2
).
Apparatus according to Claims 6 and 7, characterized in that it comprises a
second separation partition (4') defining on either side a hot compartment (6') and a

cold compartment (5'), the hot compartment (6') delined by the second partition (4')
being common to the hot compartment (6) defined by the first separation partition

(4).
Apparatus according to Claim 8, characterized in that the hot compartments
(6, 6'), defined by the first and second separation partitions (4, 4'), are placed

opposite each other to constitute a hot chamber, on either side of which are disposed
the cold compartments (5, 5').
Apparatus according to one of Claims 6 to 9, characterized in that each hot
compartment (6, 6') is equipped with a series of heating plates (21) mounted in

overhang, in superposed manner, extending between the meal-trays.
