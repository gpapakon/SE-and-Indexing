<ABSTRACT>
An oral vaccine comprising a complex of an antigen with a lipid, wherein the lipid contains a phospholipid comprising a 
glycolipid and/or phosphatidylserine combined with mannose. The vaccine serves to produce efficiently an antibody against the 

above antigen after being orally administered to living organisms. It makes it possible to administer orally a microbial antigen or 
a weakly virulent microbe which has not been orally absorbable and has been incapable of producing an antibody thereagainst.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oral vaccine capable of 
efficiently producing antibodies after the oral administration. The 
oral vaccine of the present invention efficiently produces antibodies 
to antigens kept therein after the oral administration thereof to 
exhibit an effect of prevention from infection. Most vaccines currently used are in the form of a subcutanesous 
injection. However, the subcutaneous injection has clinical problems 
such as infrequent side effects and a pain caused by the injection. 
Various investigations are made on the administration method for the 
purpose of solving the problems. The development of an oral vaccine is 
the most desirable, since the dosage form thereof is safe and the 
administration thereof is convenient. Although investigations have been hitherto made on the oral 
vaccine with a buffering agent, tablets with enteric coating, 
microparticles, nano-particles and adjuvants, they have not been 
succeeded yet [International Journal of Pharmaceutics, 75, 1 (1991); 
and Journal of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics, 16, 309 (1991)]. In 
the general remarks of them, some examples of the application of 
liposomes having an orthodox membrane composition to the oral vaccine  
 
are reported. However, these techniques are far from the practical 
application, while the antibody titer is elevated to some extent. Thus, no means of efficiently producing the antibodies after the 
oral administration have been developed yet in the prior art. It is known to administer liposomes having a membrane modified 
with phosphatidylserine by intravenous injection [Cancer Research, 40, 
4460 (1980)], and it was reported that liposomes having a membrane 
modified with a mannose derivative or mannan derivative are cumulated 
in the liver and lungs [Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 632, 562 (1980), 
and "Byotai Seiri (Pathophysiology)", 6, 771 (1985)]. The object of the present invention is to provide an oral 
vaccine capable of efficiently producing antibodies to microbial 
antigens kept therein or antigens comprising attenuated microorganisms 
after the oral administration thereof to the living body. The present invention relates to an oral vaccine comprising a 
complex of antigens and lipids. The antibody titer of the complex can 
be elevated even by the oral administration, since it comprises a 
glycolipid having mannose as a lipid and/or a phospholipid which is 
phosphatidylserine. Complexes can be classified into (a) aggregates comprising 
irregularly arranged protein or
