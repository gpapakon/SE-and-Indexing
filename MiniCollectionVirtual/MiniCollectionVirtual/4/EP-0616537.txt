<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of an antibody recognizing
the CDw52 antigen for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment
of multiple sclerosis in a human or animal
subject.The cells and molecules in an animal body do not
normally stimulate an adaptive immune response in that body
as a result of a number of mechanisms which ensure a state
referred to as "self-tolerance". However, in certain
circumstances these mechanisms may fail to prevent the
stimulation of such an immune response and this condition
is referred to as "auto-immunity". A number of diseases in
humans and animals are now thought to result from auto-immunity.Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease of the
central nervous system the onset of which generally occurs
within the age range from about 15 to 45. Myelin is a
fatty substance which forms a sheath around certain nerve
fibres and which conducts nervous impulses at a rate which
enables muscles to make precise and delicate movements.
The disease is characterised by induration of the sheath
substance leading to the formation of plaques of varying
size and location which interfere with the impulses
normally conducted by the sheath. The course of the
disease can be highly variable in individual patients and
may be subject to periods of spontaneous remission.
However, the disease generally results in progressive
deterioration of the control of muscle function with
ultimate paralysis in many cases. The precise cause of
multiple sclerosis is unknown and it may result from a
complex interaction of a number of different factors.
However, it is now generally recognised that there is at
least an autoimmune component in the causation of the
disease.The CDw52 antigen (a 23kDa glycoprotein also referred
to as CAMPATH-1) is strongly expressed on the surface of
all human lymphocytes and most monocytes but is absent from 
other blood cells including stem cells. A number of
antibodies have been developed directed against CDw52 which
is an unusually good target for complement-mediated attack.
Antibodies against CDw52 bind to all lymphocytes and
monocytes but lyse only lymphocytes (T and B) invivo.
Antigens similar to CDw52 are expressed in other mammalian
species.Antibodies which have been developed against CDw52 and
which have been used in therapy include the following:CAMPATH-1M is a rat IgM monoclonal antibody which has
been used extensively invitro for purging bone marrow
harvests in order to deplete the T cell population prior to
bone marrow transplantation. Marked reduction in
