A fluid-actuated pilot valve, in particular pneumatic valve, with a 
switch element arranged in a valve body, the switch element having 

a piston crown arranged transversally to the switching direction and 
on which a control pressure is applicable, the valve body having at 

least one pressure supply port, a distribution port, a bleeder and a 
control pressure port for applying pressure to the switch element, 

as well as valve bores connected with the said ports and with the 
bleeder, the passageway to the distribution port being accomplished 

via a connection bore in the switch element,
 
characterised in that: 


a) the switch element (13) has a central piston portion (27) and an 
external. coaxially arranged piston portion (26); 
b) a control pressure S1 is axially applicable on one side of the 
outer piston portion (26) and a control pressure S2 is axially 

applicable on the other side of the outer piston portion (26) in 
order to achieve two switching positions; and 
c) a pressure supp!v port P or a bleeder port R is sealed off in 
dependance of the switching position by the oppositely arranged 

piston surfaces of the central piston portion (27); 
A switch valve according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the coaxial piston portions (26, 27; 70. 84, 77) of the switch 

element (13, 68) are respectively formed by two equal piston parts 
(28, 29, 30, 31) which are arranged opposite one another, the 

central portion of the switch element (13, 68) arranged 
transversally to the displacement axis forming a piston crown (32) 

common to all the piston parts (28, 29, 30 31). 
A switch valve according to one or more of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that,
 
in case of an embodiment in the form of a 3/2-way valve, the 

centra! piston-/cylinder-unit is correlated to the pressure supply 
bore (15) or a pressure release bore (62) arranged opposite thereto, 

and a coaxially arranged, ring-like shaped outer piston-/cylinder-unit 
is correlated to the control pressure ports (s1, s2). 
A switch valve according to one or more of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that
 
in an embodiment in the form of a 5/2-way valve the central piston/cylinder-unit 

is correlated to distribution bores (69, 76) which are 
arranged opposite one another, and a coaxially arranged, ring-like 

shaped outer piston-/cylinder-unit is correlated to the control 
pressure ports (s1, s2). 
A switch valve according to one or more of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in
 that
 
the valve body (10, 67) comprises a basis part (11, 65) and a lid 

part (12, 66) connected thereto. 
A switch valve according to claim 5
 
characterised in that
 
the basis part (11, 65) is provided with cylinder portions (18, 19;  

 
73, 81, 88) which are correlated to the piston parts (28, 30) which 

are arranged on the side of the switch element (13, 68) facing the 
basis part (11, 65), and that the lid part (12, 66) is provided with 

cylinder portions (59, 60, 74, 70, 89) which are correlated to the 
piston parts (29, 31) on the side of the switch element (13, 68) 

facing the lid part (12, 66). 
A switch valve according to one or more of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that
 
for sealing off the openings of the valve bores (15, 62; 69, 76) 

correlated with the central piston-/cylinder-unit preferably disc-like 
seal elements (49, 50) are provided in a piston crown portion (38) 

of the switch element (13, 68). 
A switch valve according to one or more of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that
 
cylindrical piston walls (33, 34) which border the outer piston parts 

(28, 29) are provided with preferably O-ring-like seal elements (45, 
46, 47, 48) to seal off the outer piston parts (28, 29) of the switch 

element (13, 68). 
A switch valve according to one or more of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that
 
a cylindrical piston wall (33) which borders the central piston parts 

(30, 31) is provided with preferably O-ring-like sealing elements 
(47, 48) to seal off the central piston parts (30, 31) of the switch 

element (13, 68). 
A switch valve according to one or more of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that
 
all valve ports are provided on one side of the valve.
