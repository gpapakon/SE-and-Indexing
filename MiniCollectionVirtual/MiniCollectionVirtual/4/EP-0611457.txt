<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the formation of a radiographic 
image. More specifically this invention relates to improvements 
in radiographic images formed with an intensifying screen. Still 
more specifically, this invention relates to improvements in 
sensitization of radiographic film for use with ultraviolet emitting 
intensifying screens. Radiography has been employed for many years as a 
medical diagnostic tool. A subject to be studied is placed between 
a x-ray radiation source and a detection system which typically 
includes an intensifying screen and a suitable photographic film. 
Intensifying screens have been employed in the art as a 
conversion device wherein x-ray radiation is converted to lower 
energy radiation such as visible radiation. Photographic film 
captures the image emitted by the intensifying screen and with 
subsequent development of the photographic film an image is 
generated which represents the variations in absorption of x-ray 
radiation as it passed through the subject. Subject dosage and image quality are typically directly 
related for a given film/screen combination. There is an ongoing 
need to improve the image quality without increasing overall 
dosage for the subject. The dilemma has been advanced 
substantially by the use of both sensitizing and acutance dyes 
within the photographic element. Sensitizing dyes are known in the art as a means for 
increasing the sensitivity of a silver halide emulsion to a specific 
band of wavelengths. A myriad of dyes have been presented to 
the art field as exemplified in Research Disclosure, No 308, 
December, 1989, Item 308119. In the field of radiography the 
spectral response of the silver halide emulsion preferably  
 
corresponds to the blue or green emission of the intensifying 
screen. Acutance dyes have been presented in the art as a means of 
greatly improving image quality with subsequent minor increase 
in subject dose. This improved image quality is accomplished by 
decreasing the amount of light which scatters within the emulsion 
and more importantly by decreasing the amount of cross-over. 
Cross-over typically refers to screen emission which passes 
through, and is scattered by, the closest emulsion and the 
substrate and is subsequently captured by the emulsion on the 
opposite side of the support. The scattering of the emission as it 
passes through the support decreases the resolution of the 
resulting image. Pyrazolone dyes have shown great utility as 
crossover dyes as exemplified in U. S. Patents 4,900,652;
