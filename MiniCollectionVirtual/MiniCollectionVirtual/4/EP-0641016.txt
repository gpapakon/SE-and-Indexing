<ABSTRACT>
A thin reflective cylindrical baffle [20] in a radiant lamp heater is 

provided in the space below a plurality of heating bulbs [2,4,6] (arranged in a 

center position and around a middle and outer ring) and above a quartz 
window [12]
. The baffle diameter is such that it fits within the annular space 
between the middle [4]
 and outer [6] ring of bulbs. The baffle [20]
 allows 
improved controllability of wafer temperature profile -for a wafer heated by a 

radiant lamp heater.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor wafer lamp
heater.The use of direct radiant lamp heating of silicon wafers in
Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP) equipment is gaining
widespread acceptance. Experimental observations suggest
that the lamp heater is a critical factor in achieving an
acceptable temperature ramp time, and controllable process
uniformity on the wafer. 38 kW lamp modules have been shown
to provide good temperature ramping performance resulting in
fast throughput and short process time. However, the present
uniformity performance of this equipment for high pressure
processing (e.g. 650 torr (1 Torr = 133 Pa)) is unacceptable since typically,
the center of the wafer undergoing processing is heated to
higher temperatures than the edges of the wafer. This
problem shall be explained in more detail with reference to
figures 1a and 1b which represent a top view and a side
cross-sectional view, respectively, of a prior art lamp
heater for optical zone heating of a semiconductor wafer. A
source of light comprising 37 lamps are arranged in an
axisymmetric 3-zone configuration including a central 2 kW
light bulb 2, a middle ring of 12 1 kW light bulbs 4, and an
outer ring of 24 1 kW light bulbs 6. Bulb 2 shall be 
referred to as the central zone lamp. Middle ring of bulbs 4
shall be referred to as the middle zone of lamps and outer
ring 6 shall be referred to the outer zone of lamps. The
bulbs fit into lamp assembly 3. The radiant power emitted
from the bulbs is concentrated by gold plating 8 into
process chamber 9 onto silicon wafer 10 (for instance, a 6
inch diameter wafer), through quartz window 12. Quartz
window 12 can, for instance, be 10 inches in diameter and
1/2 inch (1 inch = 2.54 cm) thick. Radiant power will be directed at wafer 10.
Heating uniformity is attempted through the manipulation of
electrical power supplied to each zone of lamps. Thus
selective heating of the outer rim, 11, of wafer 10 is
intended relative to central portion 13 of wafer 10 by
generating more radiant power from the outer zone of lamps
than from the other zone of lamps. However, this lamp heater
allows significant optical overlap between the three zones
of lamps in terms of incident radiant power on wafer 10.
This overlap is the source of the problem with the
temperature profile and process uniformity control since
central portion 13 of wafer 10 is heated more by the heater
relative to the rest of wafer 10, particularly around edge
11. Even in an attempt to prevent this non uniform heating,
with the outer
