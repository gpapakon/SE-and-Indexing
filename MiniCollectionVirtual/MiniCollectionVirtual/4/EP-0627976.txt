<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to coated, shaped articles 
prepared from a biodegradable material and to processes for 
making and using such articles. It has long been known that disposable articles 
are filling up the solid waste facilities of this country. 
Plastic articles, in particular, pose a difficult disposal 
problem. Such articles usually require many years to decay 
in landfills, and such articles may remain in essentially 
unaltered form for generations. One potential solution for reducing the amount of 
plastic solid waste is recycling. A plastic product may, if 
properly recycled, have several "lives" in different forms 
and shapes. While recycling provides a useful and desirable 
means of reducing the amount of solid waste generated, it 
does not solve the problem of final disposal of the plastic. In our society disposability has become a way of 
life. Sizable segments of the consuming public use products 
that are geared to convenience and these consumers are often 
not motivated to take part in the recycling projects that 
can significantly affect our solid waste landfills. With 
respect to consumer products, such as disposable razors, 
attempts at interesting users in marketing programs designed 
to facilitate recycling have met with failure. Consumers 
are apparently not eager to take the extra time or expend 
the extra effort to make such programs work. It is an 
object of the present invention to provide a shaped article, 
such as, but not limited to, a disposable razor, in a form 
that is acceptable to the disposable product using public  
 
while simultaneously offering an easy, efficient method for 
consumers to activate the degradation process. Another potential solution to the problem of 
disposal of plastic solid wastes is to make plastic articles 
out of "biodegradable" materials. Generally speaking, 
biodegradable materials are those that can readily be broken 
down into constituent elements that are either beneficial 
to, or are at least not adverse to, the biosphere. An 
example of such a "biodegradable" plastic is NOVON brand 
biodegradable polymer, a starch-based polymer described in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,673,438 and U.S. Patent No. 4,738,724. 
Shaped articles 
made from such a material can rapidly be broken down in 
landfills and can even provide nutrients for the soil in the 
landfill in the process. One difficulty with biodegradable plastics such as 
NOVON brand biodegradable polymer is that such materials are 
not well suited for use in wet environments. The very 
factors that

A shaped article for use in a hostile fluid environment, comprising: 

(a) an inner core of a formable biodegradable material; 
(b) an outer coating of a material resistant to said hostile fluid 
environment covering said inner core; and 
(c) exposure means for manual activation to expose said formable 
biodegradable material to at least one degradation agent. 
The article of claim 1, wherein said inner core comprises a 
thermoplastic material derived from starch. 
The article of claim 1, wherein the hostile fluid environment is an 
aqueous environment. 
The article of claim 1, wherein said inner core further comprises 
at least one additional material.

materials comprises a thermoplastic material derived from starch. 
The article of claim 4, wherein at least one of said inner core 
materials comprises a non-thermoplastic, biodegradable material. 
The article of claim 6, wherein said non-thermoplastic 
biodegradable material comprises a material derived from wood or paper. 
The article of claim 1, wherein said inner core comprises a material 
derived from wood.  

 
The article of claim 1, wherein said hostile liquid environment is 
an organic environment. 
The article of claim 4, wherein at least one of said additional 
materials comprises a non-biodegradable material.

thermoplastic material. 
The article of claim 1, wherein said outer coating is selected from 
the group consisting of polyurethane, shellac and lacquer. 
The article of claim 1, further comprising an adhesion means for 
joining said outer coating and said inner core. 
The article of claim 1, wherein said outer coating is applied to said 
inner core by a process selected from the group consisting of co-molding, 

co-extrusion, spraying, painting, dipping, shrink wrapping and dripping. 
The article of claim 1, wherein said exposure means comprises a 
fault in said article. 
The article of claim 1, wherein said exposure means is selected 
from the group consisting of a press fit connection or a screw connection 

between segments of said article, a peelable tab on at least one surface of 

said article, or a removable end plug of said article. 
The article of claim 15, wherein said fault comprises a V-notch or 
groove.  

 
The article of claim 17, wherein said groove is circular. 
The article of claim 17, wherein said groove is on at least one 
surface of said article. 
The article of claim 1, wherein said article comprises a toothbrush. 
The article of claim 4, wherein the percentage of biodegradable 
material in said inner core is between about 25% and about 99.9% by 

weight.

material comprises no more than 25% of the diameter of said article. 
An article according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the 
article comprises a disposable razor. 
A process for producing a shaped article comprising the steps of:

material; 
(b) forming a layer of resistant material in contact with said 
biodegradable inner core; and 
(c) incorporating an exposure means within said article for 
manual activation to expose said biodegradable inner core. 
A process for producing a shaped article comprising the steps of: 

(a) forming a composite inner core of said article from at least 
two materials at least one of said materials being biodegradable; 
(b) forming a layer of resistant material in contact with said 
composite inner core; and

inner core and forming a layer of resistant material are performed 

simultaneously.
