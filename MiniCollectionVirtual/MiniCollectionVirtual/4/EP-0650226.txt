lines and secured to the body by a molding resin. At least 
one connecting portion extends from at least one end of the 

body in a direction parallel to the metal lines. A 
fastening cover is also provided for covering the 

connecting portion whereby a plurality of positioning 
apertures is formed in at least one of the connecting 

portion and the fastening cover. The terminal end also 
including a plurality of fastening pins for engaging the 

connecting portion, the fastening pin penetration apertures

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a molded
circuit component for connecting lead wires of round
cross section to electric wires of flat cross section
in domestic, industrial or motor vehicle internal
wiring.Conventional methods and apparatus are known
for connecting flat angular conductors of a flat
electric cable to lead wires. In one of the methods,
the conductors and the lead wires are connected to each
other through a printed circuit board by soldering. In
another of the methods, the electric cable and the lead
wires are coupled to separate connectors and the
connectors are then mounted on a printed circuit board.FIG. 1 (Prior Art) is a perspective view for
describing a conventional method of connection. FIG. 1
shows a molded body 1, lead wires 2, a flat electric
cable 3, flat angular conductors 4, crimped terminals
5, a comb-shaped spacer 6, and welded joints 7. To
connect the flat electric cable 3 made of the flat
angular conductors 4 to the lead wires 2 fitted with
the crimped terminals 5 at the lead wire ends, the end
portions of the flat angular conductors 4 are overlaid
on those of the crimped terminals 5 and then spot
welded thereto to comprise the welded joints 7 for the
electrical connection. The lead wires 2 are then put
in the spacer 6. The assembly of these members is 
thereafter put in the box-shaped molded body 1 and
sealed with a molding resin.To connect round cross section lead wires to
flat electrical cable or round cross section lead wires
to a printed circuit board, it is necessary that the
connectors are coupled to exposed terminals on the
printed circuit board. The mutual contact surfaces of
the connectors and the terminals are then soldered to
each other in order to maintain reliable electrical
stability of the connector contacts and the terminals
and the mechanical strength of the contacts subject to
vibration, especially in a motor vehicle, for extended
periods of time. If some anxiety remains after the
coupling and the soldering, the mutual contact surfaces
can be spot welded to each other for higher
reliability. In that case, the electrodes of a spot
welder are set at the mutually overlaid portions of the
terminals and the flat conductors of the cable and
these portions are then vertically pressed together by
the electrodes. However, the terminals and the flat
conductors can shift rightward or leftward relative to
each other. In other words, it is difficult to
accurately position the terminals and the conductors
with respect to each other. Furthermore, there is a
possibility
