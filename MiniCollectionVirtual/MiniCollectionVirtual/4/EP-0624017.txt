<ABSTRACT>
The network comprises a transport plane (2) consisting of switching micronodes (6) linked together by highways. The transport plane (2) is suitable for allowing communication and routing of data packets or cells of between equipment items (4) of the network and with other equipment items external to the network. Each micronode (6) is controlled on the basis of instructions included in each cell header which is presented to it on a highway of the network in order to allow routing of the cell onto another highway of the network, the transmission of the number and of the states of adjacent micronodes to a unit of a centralised management plane (1) so as to keep the management unit informed at all times of the configuration of the network. Application: Local business networks.
