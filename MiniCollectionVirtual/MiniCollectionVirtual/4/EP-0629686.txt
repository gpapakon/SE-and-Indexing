<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to lead compound free high-octane
fuel compositions for internal combustion engines with
spark ignition, prepared by using hydrocarbon fuels and anti-knock
additive.There are known fuel compositions based on hydrocarbon
fuels containing ferrocene derivatives as anti-knock additive
such as m-nitrocinnamoyl ferrocene

and o-chlorocinnamoyl ferrocene

(Toma,P.Eleko, V.Vesely and M.Saliova: Derivaty ferocenu
ako prisady do benzinov. Acta Facultatis rerum naturalium
universitatis comenianae-formatio et protectio naturae 1981 No.
7, 187-192 (Ref Journal CHEMISTRY, 12, II 224 (1982))In addition, US-A-2810737 describes alpha-hydroxyalkyl 
ferrocene derivatives and their use as anti-knock agents in
spark ignition fuels.A considerable obstacle for using ferrocene and its
derivatives as an anti-knock additive to the engine fuels is
that in the combustion chamber, more specifically on sparking
plugs some deposits of iron oxides are formed, causing some
failures in the operation of an engine (E.G. Perevalova, M.D.
Reshetova, K.I. Granberg, "Methods of Elementorganic
Chemistry", Moscow, Publishing House NAUKA, 1983, p. 439
(Russian edition)).In addition said m-nitrocinnamoylferrocene and o-chlorocinnamoylferocene
are produced from ferrocene in a
number of stages with a low yield and all characterized with
a low solubility rate in the fuel composition.It is an object of the present invention to create a
high octane fuel composition for internal combustion engines
eliminating said drawbacks.Accordingly, the present invention provides a
hydrocarbon based fuel composition suitable for spark
ignition internal combustion engines, which comprises 0.001% -
0.02% by weight of 
Typically the hydrocarbon composition comprises:
aromatic hydrocarbone54 to 56 percent by weight.normal alkanes12 to 13 percent by weight.isoalkanes29 to 31 percent by weight.naphtheness1 to 2 percent by weight.Such a composition has fractions as follows:
initial boiling point:60 grad.C   distillationfraction of 10 percent;83 grad.C   distillationfraction of 50 percent:114 grad.C   distillationfraction of 90 percent:156 grad.C   distillationfraction of 96 percent:190 grad.C
density p20/4 being 0.7687 g/cm3 and motor octane number
being 80.The present invention further provides the use of
 
as an anti-knock additive suitable for fuels.The fuel composition octane number was determined on the
plant UIT-85 by a motor method according to OMEA Standard
2243-80. The plug operation-to-failure time was determined
on the single
