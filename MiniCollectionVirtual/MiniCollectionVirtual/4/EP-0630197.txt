<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a brush element (10) for the care of the hair, the element being intended in particular for a hair-care appliance producing a hot-air jet. The brush element comprises a main body (12) and several bristles (14 to 25) disposed on the main body at an angle (a) to the normal (38) to the surface of the brush element (10). The angle made by the bristles (14 to 25) to the normal (38) lies between 35 DEG  and 75 DEG  and the bristles (14 to 25) are disposed in a row (26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36) extending along the longitudinal axis (13) of the element, adjacent bristles (14, 15, 16, 17; 18, 19, 20, 21; 22, 23, 24, 25) in each row (26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36) being disposed in V-shaped pairs (37).

<CLAIMS>
A brush element (10) for hair care, in particular 
for a heat-emitting and/or air-moving hair care 

appliance, comprising a body (12) and a plurality of 
bristles (14 to 25) arranged on the body (12) at an angle 

of inclination (a) to a surface normal (38) of the brush 
element (10), with the angle of inclination of the 

bristles (14 to 25) to the surface normal (38) being between 
15° and 75°, and the bristles (14 to 25) being 

arranged in several rows (26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36) extending 
in the direction of a brush element longitudinal axis 

(13), with adjacent bristles (14 to 25) of a row (26, 28, 
30, 32, 34, 36) forming V-shaped bristle pairs (37), 


characterized in that
 in that at least two rows (26, 28; 
30, 32; 34, 36) combine to form a pair of rows (40, 42, 

44), and that the rows (26, 28; 30, 32; 34, 36) of a pair 
of rows (40, 42, 44) are spaced at such a relative distance 

that the bristles (15, 16; 19, 20; 23, 24) intersect 
in a region (52). 
The brush element as claimed in claim 1, 

characterized in that
 adjacent bristles (14, 16, 15, 17; 
18, 20, 19, 21; 22, 24, 23, 25) of a pair of rows (40, 

42, 44) are arranged in relative parallel orientation. 
The brush element as claimed in any one of the 
claims 1 to 2, 
characterized in that
 adjacent bristles 
(14 to 25) of a pair of rows (40, 42, 44) are arranged on 

the body (12) so their forward ends (46) are oriented towards 
and away from each other alternately.  

 
The brush element as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the adjacent 
bristles (14, 16, 15, 17; 18, 20, 19, 21; 22, 24, 23, 25) 

of a pair of rows (40, 42, 44) are arranged on the body 
(12) on a line extending normal to the brush element longitudinal 

axis (13). 
The brush element as claimed in any one of the 
claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the adjacent 
bristles (14, 16, 15, 17; 18, 20, 19, 21; 22, 24, 23, 25) 

of a pair of rows (40, 42, 44) are arranged in an offset 
orientation to each other. 
The brush element as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the bristles (14 
to 17; 18 to 21; 22 to 25) of adjacent pairs of rows (42, 

44, 46) are arranged on the body (12) so as to be inclined 
in opposite direction relative to the surface 

normal (38) (FIG. 3). 
The brush element as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the pairs of rows 
(42, 44, 46) are arranged on strips (50) which are 

attached to the body (12) by a wedging or welding operation. 
The brush element as claimed in any one of the 
claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the bristles (14, 
15; 16, 17; 18, 19; 20, 21; 22, 23; 24, 25) of each row 

(26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36) are configured as an integrally 
formed bristle strip (54). 
The brush element as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the body (12) is 
of a concave configuration.  

 
The brush element as claimed in any one of the 
claims 1 to 7 and in claim 9, 
characterized in that
 apertures 
(56) are provided in the body (12) for receiving 

the bristles (14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24), and that adjacent 
apertures (56) of a row (26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36) are at 

approximately right angles to each other.
