<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel light duty liquid 
detergent compositions with high foaming properties, containing a 
nonionic surfactant, a sulfonate surfactant, an alcohol sulfate, 
an ethoxylated alkyl ether sulfate surfactant, and an alkylpolyglucoside 
surfactant, wherein the surfactants are dissolved in an aqueous medium. Nonionic surfactants are in general chemically inert and 
stable toward pH change and are therefore well suited for mixing 
and formulation with other materials. The superior performance of 
nonionic surfactants on the removal of oily soil is well 
recognized. Nonionic surfactants are also known to be mild to 
human skin. However, as a class, nonionic surfactants are known to 
be low or moderate foamers. Consequently, for detergents which 
require copious and stable foam, the application of nonionic 
surfactants is limited. There have been substantial interest and 
efforts to develop a high foaming detergent with nonionic 
surfactants as the major active ingredient. Yet, little has been 
achieved. The prior art is replete with light duty liquid detergent 
compositions containing nonionic surfactants in combination with 
anionic and/or betaine surfactants wherein the nonionic detergent 
is not the major active surfactant, as shown in U.S. Patent No. 
3,658,985 wherein an anionic based shampoo contains a minor amount 
of a fatty acid alkanolamide. U.S. Patent No. 3,769,398 discloses  
 
a betaine-based shampoo containing minor amounts of nonionic 
surfactants. This patent states that the low foaming properties of 
nonionic detergents renders its use in shampoo compositions nonpreferred. 
U.S. Patent No. 4,329,335 also discloses a shampoo 
containing a betaine surfactant as the major ingredient and minor 
amounts of a nonionic surfactant and of a fatty acid mono- or diethanolamide. 
U.S. Patent No. 4,259,204 discloses a shampoo 
comprising 0.8-20% by weight of an anionic phosphoric acid ester 
and one additional surfactant which may be either anionic, 
amphoteric, or nonionic. U.S. Patent No. 4,329,334 discloses an 
anionic-amphoteric based shampoo containing a major amount of 
anionic surfactant and lesser amounts of a betaine and nonionic 
surfactants. U.S. Patent No. 3,935,129 discloses a liquid cleaning 
composition based on the alkali metal silicate content and 
containing five basic ingredients, namely, urea, glycerin, 
triethanolamine, an anionic detergent and a nonionic detergent. 
The silicate content determines the amount of anionic and/or 
nonionic detergent in the
