<ABSTRACT>
On an apparatus (10) for laser processing workpieces (18), and whereby a laser beam (11) is directed on to a portion (13) of a substantially perpendicular work surface (14), a jet (21) of shielding gas is fed over the work surface portion (13) crosswise in relation to the laser beam (11) and at such high speed as to substantially prevent any alteration of the physical and/or chemical properties of the gas. The jet (21) is supplied along a solid-walled conduit (26) comprising two transverse openings (29, 31) for the passage of the beam (11) onto the work surface portion (13); an d a nozzle (32) for producing a gas jet (21) of appropriate speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and device for 
gas shielding laser processed workpieces, e.g. laser 
welded metal parts. Some laser processes, such as welding, require an inert 
gas atmosphere, such as helium, argon, etc., about the 
area subjected to the laser beam, to prevent a chemical 
reaction of the material caused by the combined action 
of heat and atmospheric gases, of which oxygen is the 
most reactive. In certain cases in which the material is not negatively 
affected by nitriding, dry nitrogen may also be used 
successfully. On known devices for feeding such gas over the 
workpieces, the laser beam is directed and focused 
inside a conical nozzle together with a jet of inert 
shielding gas, usually with no separation of the two, 
and the inert gas is directed freely on to the work  
 
area. Devices of the aforementioned type present numerous 
drawbacks. One of these is that the gas remains 
contacting a frequently excessive portion of the laser 
beam over what is usually an excessive length of time. 
In this respect, it is important to bear in mind that a 
gaseous mixture is heated by a laser beam in proportion 
to its capacity to absorb radiation at the laser beam 
wave length; in proportion to the length of time it is 
subjected to such radiation; and in inverse proportion 
to its heat capacity. The first undesired effect of such 
heating is that it results in an irregular alteration of 
the refraction coefficient of the gas, thus distorting 
and impairing the focus of the laser beam, which is 
further impaired by the convective motion produced in 
the heated mixture. Should heating persist long enough for the gas to reach 
first the thermal excitation and then the thermal 
ionization threshold, this results in highly dissipative 
phenomena, which absorb the energy of the laser beam. In 
extreme cases of almost total or predominant ionization, 
the energy of the beam may be almost totally absorbed by 
the gas, thus giving rise to what is known as 
"blanketing", whereby the laser beam is practically 
prevented from reaching the workpiece. The shielding gas must therefore present a definite 
number of properties: 
1) low radiation absorption coefficient at the laser  
 
beam wave length; 2) high heat capacity; 3) high thermal ionization threshold or ionization 
potential; 4) minimum interaction or transit time (the length of 
time it is subjected to the laser beam); 5) for shielding against thermochemical reactions, the 
gas must be immune to such reactions. For this, noble 
gases
