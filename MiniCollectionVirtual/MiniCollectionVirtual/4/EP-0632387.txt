<ABSTRACT>
A scannable logic unit includes one or more storage 
registers that maintain copies of data communicated from the 

scannable unit to registers in a nonscannable unit. When the 
scannable unit is subjected to a scan test, the registers will 

contain state information respecting that transfer to the 
nonscannable unit. When the scannable and nonscannable units 

are placed into a run condition, the registers supply to the 
nonscannable unit state information for continuing operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed generally to 
digital apparatus, and more particularly, to apparatus that 
incorporates in the scan chain of a scannable circuit the 
state information conveyed to a nonscannable unit. Today's state of the art in digital design often 
will require the incorporation of features that will allow the 
design to be tested - both during production and when in the 
field in the hands of the end user. One of the more popular 
test techniques used in digital designs for test 
implementation is what is termed a "scan based design." This 
involves adding logic to the design of conventional digital 
circuitry so that, in response to test signals, the elemental 
storage units (e.g., latches, register stages, flip flops, and 
the like) of the digital circuitry can be configured into one 
or more extended shift registers ("scan chains"). Test 
patterns ("vectors") may then be introduced ("scanned") into 
the scan chains so formed, and the digital circuitry returned 
to its standard configuration and allowed to run normally for 
one or more of its operating cycles. The scan chains are then 
reformed so that the resultant registered state of the digital 
system removed and examined.  Alternatively, the digital circuit under test can be 
allowed to run normally until it reaches a point in time when 
the scan test halts the circuitry. The scan chain 
configurations are then formed, and the registered state of 
the circuitry is removed, observed, reinstated, and the unit 
allowed to proceed after being returned to its standard 
configuration. Scan designs provide an effective and efficient 
method of establishing controllability and observability over 
the "registered state" of the digital circuitry (i.e., the 
states assumed the elemental memory units at any moment in 
time) in that operation of the unit under test can be stopped 
at any point in time, the unit reconfigured to its scan 
configuration, and that state retrieved, observed, and 
replaced. The digital circuitry under test may then be 
returned to the normal operating mode and continue until it is 
again stopped and its registered state observed as described. Often, designs of digital units in the current art 
will combine such scannable components with standard, off-the-shelf 
components (e.g., microprocessors, random access 
memories (RAMs), and the like) that are not designed to be 
scannable. Thus, the registered state of these standard 
components are, therefore, outside the controllable and 
observable domains of a scan

Apparatus for including state information of a 
nonscannable digital device in a scan of a scannable device, 

the state being transferred by the scannable device to the 
nonscannable, the apparatus comprising; 

   register means in the scannable device for receiving 
the state information communicated by the scannable device to 

the nonscannable device; and 
   means for selecting the register means for 

communication to the nonscannable device at the conclusion of 
a scan test. 
In a digital system including a scannable logic 
unit having a plurality of elemental storage units 

configurable from an operating mode to respond to a first test 
signal to form at least one extended shift register, certain 

of the plurality of elemental state elements forming a first 
register means, and a non-scannable logic unit having a second 

register means coupled to receive data from the first register 
means, the scannable logic unit having apparatus comprising: 

   third register means formed from other of the 
plurality of the elemental storage units, the third register 

means being coupled to receive the data coupled to the second 
register means; and 

   selection means coupled to the first and the third 
register means for selectively communicating data from the 

first register means or the third register means to the second 
register means in response to a one of the test signals. 
The apparatus of claim 2, wherein the selection 
means is a multiplexer.
