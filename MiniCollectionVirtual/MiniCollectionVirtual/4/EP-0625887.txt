<ABSTRACT>
Polymeric preferably bioabsorbable, interference screws (30, 70, 90) having increased helical thread thickness (TT) and decreased thread depth (TD) relative to corresponding metal insertion screws (10, 50) to provide increased wall thicknesses, which enhances overall rigidity and strength of the absorbable interference screw (30, 70, 90). A proximal region (PR) of the screw (30, 70, 90) increases gradually in diameter (MA, MI) proximally to increase the bite and holding power of the screw (30, 70, 90) as well as to increase wall thickness. The proximal region (PR) increases proximally in at least one of a proximal region minor diameter (PRMI) and a proximal region major diameter (PRMA). Also featured are screws (90) having an absorbable coating (92).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polymeric screws
and absorbable screw coatings, and more particularly to
improved absorbable screws and coated screws for
surgical use.There are a number of surgical procedures in
which a fastener such as a screw or nail is inserted
into a tissue of a patient. One surgical use involves
insertion of an interference screw into a bone tunnel
to secure a bone plug in place to attach an end of an
anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) replacement. ACL
reconstruction procedures and interference screws are
disclosed for example in WO 90/08510 U.S. Patent Nos. 5,062,843,
4,950,270 and 4,927,421 and in the following articles:
Matthews et al., "Pitfalls in the Use of Interference
Screws for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction:
Brief Report", J. Arthroscopic and Related Surgery
5(3):225-226 (1989) and Kurosaka et al., "A Biomechanical
Comparison of Different Surgical Techniques
of Graft Fixation in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction",
Am. J. Sports Medicine 15:225-9 (1987).Surgeons and patients desire absorbable
implants which will be partially or completely absorbed 
by the body. An absorbable lag screw for fracture
fixation and having a rounded head, for example, is
disclosed in German Patent DE 3,811,345.A relatively large amount of torque must be
applied to an interference screw during insertion. A
screw formed from a bioabsorbable material is likely to
have a significantly lower strength, however, and
therefore should not be subjected to high torque during
insertion. It would be desirable to improve the
configuration of the screw or to lower the amount of
torque which must be applied to the screw.Coatings having a low coefficient of friction
have been applied to a number of surgical devices
including suture needles and hypodermic needles (U.S.
Patent No. 2,814,296), and surgical staples (U.S.
Patent No. 4,655,222). Typically, most or all of the
exterior surface of these devices are coated with a low
coefficient of friction material such as Teflon,
available from E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.Other uses of a Teflon-type material include
incorporation into surgical sutures (U.S. Patent No.
4,362,162), on razor blades (U.S. Patent No. 4,012,551)
and on screws to provide self-sealing fasteners (U.S.
Patent No. 3,494,243). Other uses include application
of absorbable or nonabsorbable plastics (including
polytetrafluoroethylene) to staples as disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 4,275,813. Use of Teflon and other
resins for resisting corrosion has been disclosed for
dental implants in U.S.

<CLAIMS>
An interference screw insertable into a
tunnel drilled in a bone to secure a graft anchor plug

in place, comprising an elongated, substantially
cylindrical screw body having a distal end and a

proximal end, said proximal end defining means for
engaging a driver and lacking a head member, said

elongated body formed of a polymeric material, said
elongated body defining a helical thread about its

exterior and having a body major diameter and a body
minor diameter, and said elongated body further defining

a distal region which decreases in diameter advancing
distally and terminates in said distal end, and

defining a proximal region which, advancing proximally
toward said proximal end, increases to at least one of

(a) a proximal region major diameter greater than said
body major diameter, and (b) a proximal region minor

diameter greater than said body minor diameter.
The interference screw of Claim 1 in
which said elongated body is formed of a bioabsorbable

material and said helical thread extends over said
distal region with a substantially narrower thread

width, for at least one revolution of said thread, than
the thread width of the proximal remainder of said

helical thread.
The interference screw of Claim 2 in
which said elongated body terminates in a substantially

rounded distal tip at its distal end. 
The interference screw of Claim 1 in
which said elongated body is formed of a bioabsorbable

material and further including a bioabsorbable coating
disposed about the exterior surface of said elongated

body, said coating having a coefficient of friction
which is lower than that of the exterior surface of

said elongated body.
The interference screw of Claim 4 in
which said coating is a polycaprolate-type material.
The interference screw of Claim 5 in
which said polycaprolate-type material is a random

copolymer of 85 weight percent epsilon-caprolactone and
15 weight percent glycolide.
The interference screw of Claim 1 in
which said proximal region major diameter tapers

outwardly at an angle of up to ten degrees.
The interference screw of Claim 1 in
which said proximal region major diameter tapers

outwardly at an angle of about three to five degrees.
