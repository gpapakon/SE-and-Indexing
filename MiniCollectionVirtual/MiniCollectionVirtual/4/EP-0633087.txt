<ABSTRACT>
A saw blade has a basic body (12) to which boron nitride particles (14) are applied in the cutting area (18). The boron nitride particles (14) are bonded by a metallic bonding layer (16) which preferably consists of nickel or a nickel alloy with a Vickers hardness of at least 600 HV. The bonding layer (16) is preferably deposited electrolytically. The boron nitride particles (14) advantageously have a particle size of about 0.5 to 0.8 mm, preferably of about 0.6 to 0.7 mm. The saw blade (10) exhibits special advantages when used as a jigsaw blade during the sawing of spheroidal-graphite cast-iron pipes with cement lining and fibre-reinforced outer cement casing, in which case a considerably improved cutting capacity and tool life result.

onto which boron nitride particles (14, 24) are bonded by
means of a metallic bonding layer (16, 26).
The method of claim 1, characterized in that a saw blade
is utilized, wherein the bonding layer (16, 26) is made of

nickel or a nickel alloy.
The method of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that a saw
blade is utilized, wherein the bonding layer (16, 26) is

galvanically deposited.
