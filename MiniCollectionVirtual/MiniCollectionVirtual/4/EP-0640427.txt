<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for balancing an aluminum drive shaft 
32 uses a transition material 10 to attach steel 

counterweights 28 to the aluminum drive shaft 32. The 
transition material 10 is disposed between an outer 

surface of the aluminum drive shaft 32 and an inner 
surface of the steel counterweights 28. A resistance 

welding process is then applied to the aluminum drive 
shaft 32, the steel counterweights 28, and the 

transition material 10 to resistance weld the inner 
surface of the steel counterweights to the outer 

surface of the aluminum drive shaft. The transition 
material 10 has a first surface 12 adjacent to the 

aluminum drive shaft 32 and a second surface 14 
adjacent to the steel counterweights 28, with the first 

surface 12 being aluminum and the second surface 14 
being steel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to use of transition
materials to attach steel to aluminium. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a method for attaching a steel
counterweight to an aluminium shaft by projection welding using
transition materials components. While the invention is subject to a wide
range of applications, it is especially suited for use in
balancing an aluminium drive shaft for rotation about an axis and
will be particularly described in that connection.Often, it is desirable to employ combinations of materials
in order to obtain benefits of the properties of each material.
For example, drive shafts for vehicles may be developed of
aluminium, which offers substantial weight reduction and reduced
rotational inertia over steel drive shafts. However,
counterweights must be attachable to the shafts in order to
properly balance the shafts. The preferred material for these
counterweights is steel, since steel has a significantly greater
mass density than aluminium and a much larger piece of aluminium
would be required to perform as a counterweight if aluminium were 
used. Hence, it is desired to combine the light weight, heat
conductivity, electrical conductivity, and corrosion resistance
properties of aluminium with the greater mass density, high
strength, and hardness, of steel. However, joining these two
materials presents many problems.One method of joining aluminium and steel is resistance
projection welding. The typical resistance projection welding
method of joining aluminium to steel, however, is generally
considered infeasible due to formation of undesirable
discontinuities or defects along the bond line or weld zone.Another method of joining aluminium to steel is fusion
welding. However, steel and aluminium are of considerably
different melting points, making fusion welding difficult. In
particular, steel and aluminium form a series of brittle
intermetallics. As a result, many problems occur in trying to
fusion weld steel to aluminium including discontinuities in the
weld line, weak welds between two incompatible materials such as
steel and aluminium, breakage due to differential expansion and
contraction, diffusion forming brittle intermetallic compounds
at the interface between the two materials, high stresses due to
residual strains from the welding operation, and galvanic
couples that cause corrosion.It is seen then that there exists a need for a process of
attaching steel to aluminium which overcomes the aforementioned
problems, including reducing the amount of heat
