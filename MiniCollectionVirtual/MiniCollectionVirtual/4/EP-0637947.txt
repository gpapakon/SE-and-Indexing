<ABSTRACT>
A radially expandable tubular prosthesis (16) which allows for controlled expansion in a circumferential direction following implantation while limiting expansion in a longitudinal direction. The prosthesis (16) is particularly suited to intraluminal implantation via a catheter and is also particularly suited for percutaneous implantation in children.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tubular prosthesis
and, more particularly, to a radially expandable tubular
prosthesis which allows controlled expansion in a
circumferential direction following implantation while
limiting expansion in a longitudinal direction.The typical prosthesis of the prior art is
manufactured with a predetermined diameter, that is,
prostheses are manufactured in various sizes so that the
physician may choose the most appropriate-sized prosthesis
to replace or repair the damaged lumen in the patient. As
far as length is concerned, the physician merely cuts the
chosen prosthesis to size, the prosthesis typically being
oversized in the longitudinal direction.The commonly-employed prosthesis mentioned above is
suitable for use in many situations. However, several
applications may demand that the prosthesis be expandable
in the radial direction. For example, one such
application involves intraluminal implant procedures in
which the prosthesis is delivered to a damaged lumen via a
catheter. The technique requires that the implant be
stored within the catheter (e.g., it may be rolled or
bunched) prior to insertion of the catheter into the
patient. Upon advancement of the catheter to the site of
the damage, the implant is expelled from the catheter,
unrolled (or unfolded) and thereafter secured to the
lumen. Because of the procedure, it is difficult, if not
impossible, for the physician to correct any mismatch in
sizing that may occur between the implant and the host
lumen. For example, if the physician miscalculates the
size of the lumen receiving the implant or should the
lumen prove to be larger or smaller than anticipated by
the physician, the physician may not be able to securely
fix the implant to the host lumen. An endo-prosthesis of the stent type is disclosed in US-A-4,922,905.
This stent is a tubular structure of a fabric of
loosely interlocked loops of filament material which can be
introduced and locally expanded by an expandible catheter
which after placement of the stent can be removed. Another application in which it would be desirable to
employ an expandable prosthesis involves the area of
pediatrics. A common disadvantage encountered in
conventional pediatric prostheses is the inability of the
device to accommodate growth changes in the surrounding
tissue as the child ages. Consequently, it is often
necessary to perform several surgical procedures on a
child to implant ever increasingly circumferentially-larger
prostheses. It has traditionally been necessary to
entirely

<CLAIMS>
A radially expandable tubular artificial graft for
replacing or repairing a damaged lumen, made of a polymeric

fabric 
characterized in that
 the fabric has yarns (14) which
extend around its circumference and are sufficiently undrawn

in the pre-use state to allow for circumferential streching of
said yarns beyond their yield point of plastic deformation

upon the application of a preselected radial force thereto in
order to achieve a controlled inelastic radial expansion of

the tubular graft (10).
The prosthesis of claim 1, wherein said yield point of
said yarns exceeds natural physiological pressures experienced

in a human body.
The prosthesis of claim 2, wherein said fabric is woven
and includes substantially drawn warp yarns which limit

expansion of said prosthesis in the longitudinal direction and
fill yarns which are at most partially drawn to allow

expansion of said prosthesis in the radial direction.
The prosthesis of the claims 2 or 3, wherein said yield
point of said undrawn fill yarns occurs at a pressure

approximately 10 times the pressure of natural physiological
pressures.
The prosthesis of any one of the claims 1 to 4, wherein
the molecular structure of said yarns is directionally

oriented.
The prosthesis of any one of the claims 1 to 5, further
comprising means for securing said prosthesis to a host

vessel.
