<ABSTRACT>
A construction for automatically milking animals, 
such as cows, with with a milking parlour (1) equipped with a 

milking robot (11). For optimum use, the construction comprises 
a movable detector (36, 98) capable of being utilized at 

least in two compartments (2, 3). In a first compartment (2) 
the detector may be utilized for connecting a cluster to the 

teats and, upon completion of this operation, in a second 
compartment (3) it may be utilized for positioning a cleaning/massaging 

device (12, 107).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a construction for
automatically milking animals, such as cows, provided with a
milking parlour and a milking robot with a detector for
detecting the teats of an animal, which detector is pivotable
about at least one vertical shaft and capable of being
utilized in at least two compartments.Such a construction is known from GB - 2 218 888.In this construction the milking robot rolls on a
support rail which is located behind a herringbone milking
parlour. The milking robot is further provided with a
detector for detecting the teats of an animal. In order to be
able to detect the teats of the animal, without that the
hind legs of the animal form an obstacle or get hit by the
robot arm, the milking robot is provided with a robot arm
construction which has two vertical pivot shafts. The
disadvantage of this construction is that the animal's
hind legs can be hit by the robot arm construction which can
result in that the animal kicks against the robot arm
construction or the detector as a result of which the milking
robot gets damaged.It is an object of the invention to prevent the
above-mentioned disadvantage.In accordance with the invention, this is achieved
in that the pivotable shaft is disposed in an interspace in
between the two compartments. Due to the fact that the
vertical pivot shaft is arranged in between the two
compartments the detector can be moved towards the teats by
pivoting the detector around only one pivot axis, while
furthermore the pivot axis can be arranged in such a way in
between the two compartments that it is prevented that the
animal's legs get hit by the robot arm construction. A further
advantage of the robot arm construction of the present
invention is that when the teats of the animal in the other 
compartment have to be detected, the detector can very simple
be positioned by only pivoting it around the vertical axis,
contrary to the state of the art document, no complex
positioning movements are necessary with the robot arm
construction according to the invention.According to a feature of the invention, the
detector is pivotable through a parallelogram construction.
To enable the detector to be moved in the longitudinal
direction of the milking parlour, according to another
feature of the invention, the parallelogram construction is
connected 
with a frame movable in the longitudinal direction of the
milking parlour. According to another feature of the
invention, for this purpose the movable frame is disposed in
an interspace provided in between
