<ABSTRACT>
An antenna lattice for use in a magnetically based electronic article 
surveillance system. The lattice includes a field-producing coil assembly which 

includes a pair of trapezoidal-shaped segments, each having a diagonally 
extending lower portion, the segments being juxtaposed in a mirror image so 

that the diagonal portions are opposite each other. The segments are connected 
so that vertical components of the currents in the diagonal sections at least 

partially cancel. Preferably, top horizontal sections of each segment are located 
at different levels, thereby extending the upper coverage, and a detector coil 

preferably also juxtaposed extends above the top horizontal section of the 
field-producing coil to further extend the range of detection.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electronic article surveillance systems and, in
particular, to coil/lattice configurations for producing and detecting magnetic
fields in interrogation zones associated with such systems.The initial commercial introduction of magnetically based electronic
article surveillance (EAS) systems over twenty years ago included the use of a
marker formed of a strip of permalloy about seven inches long, adopted to be
concealed within the spine of a book, adhered between pages, etc. The strip
was basically detectable only in one direction, hence various techniques were
developed to overcome that limitation. Some were directed to the markers
themselves, such as the use of more than one marker, positioned at right
angles, L or X shaped markers, etc.Still other techniques were directed to providing interrogation fields
extending in various directions such that the markers could be detected
regardless of their orientation. Thus, for example, US-A-3,665,449
and US-A-3,697,996 disclose the use of three coils positioned to
generate fields in three orthogonal directions, together with electronic circuitry
to sequentially energize each of the coils, thereby generating spatially separated
fields, each of which extended primarily in one direction so as to enhance the
detection of markers oriented so as to be detectable in that direction.US-A-4,135,183 is directed to a different way of
providing multidirectional detection. In that reference, it is proposed that
complex, hence expensive, systems requiring sequential energization be avoided
by providing a pair of coils, each of which is substantially planar, positioned on
opposite sides of a corridor defining an interrogation zone therebetween. Both
coils have substantially the same overall shape, and are wound in either a
Figure-8 or hour-glass configuration. Such coils are said to produce fields that
vary significantly in different regions and, thereby, enhance the detectability of
markers regardless of orientation in the zone. Other techniques for providing fields extending in different directions
throughout the interrogation zone to enhance the detection of unidirectionally
responsive markers regardless of orientation in the zone discussed in
US-A-4,309,697; US-A-4,326,198; and US-A-4,623,877.US-A-4,309,697 proposes the use of a pair of lattice assemblies
positioned parallel with each other, on opposite sides of an interrogation zone
extending therebetween. A rhomboid-shaped transmitting, i.e., field-producing,
coil is to be positioned within each

124,132,134,144) which includes at least a pair of

substantially similarly configured coil segments
(38,40,84,86) juxtaposed in substantially a

coplanar orientation, each segment (38,40,84,86)
having


i) a pair of spaced apart and substantially
vertical arms (42,44,92,94,96,98),
ii) a top section, substantially horizontal
(48,50,88,90,126,128,130,136,138,140,142) and

detectability of electronic article surveillance
markers (18) located proximate thereto while the

field resulting from current in the diagonally

least partially cancels and thus minimizes
interference from electromagnetically active

objects proximate a surface on which said
electronic article surveillance system may be
