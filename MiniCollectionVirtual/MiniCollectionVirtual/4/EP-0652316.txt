<ABSTRACT>
The adjusting device provided especially for an oppositely directed adjustment of the two draw-off cam parts of a cam system of the machine carriage of a flat knitting machine has a plurality of first control slides (15/1, 15/2, 15/3) which are drive-coupled to a single stepping motor (20) and are adjustable in the carriage running direction and a plurality of which in each case act via a corresponding plurality of control cams (25.1, 26.1; 25.2, 26.2) on second control slides (16/1, 16/2) which are coupled to the cam parts to be adjusted.

Adjusting device for cam parts of flat knitting machines, in particular for adjusting
the two take-down cam parts of a cam system of the machine carriage in opposite

directions, comprising a common stepping motor (20) which is moved together with
the machine carriage and the rotational movement of which is converted into a

longitudinal movement in the direction of movement of the carriage and transmitted
via at least one control cam to the cam parts (12, 13) to be adjusted, characterised

in that an output pinion (19) of the stepping motor (20) acts simultaneously and in
opposite directions direction directly on two first control slide valves (15) adjustable

in the direction of movement of the carriage and provided with a toothed slat (17),
both operatively coupled in sections via a control cam (25, 26) to at least two

second control slide valves (16) each connected to a cam part (12) to be adjusted.
Adjusting device according to claim 1, characterised in that at least one of the two
first control slide valves (15/1, 15/2) driven directly by the stepping motor (20) is

operatively coupled via at least one coupling pinion (18) to at least one further
adjustable first control slide valve (15/1) parallel to the other two.
Adjusting device according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that at least one
of the first control slide valves (15/1, 15/2) has at least one guide roller (21, 22)

which cooperates at least in sections with a control cam (25.1, 26.1; 25.2, 26.2) of a
second control slide valve (16/1; 16/2).
Adjusting device according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that at least one
of the first control slide valves (15/3) is provided with at least one guideway (24) in

or on which a guide roller (23) arranged on a second control slide valve (16/3) is
guided at least in sections.
Adjusting device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the second
control slide valve (16/1, 16/2) is provided with at least two control cams (25.1,

26.1; 25.2, 26.2) formed at a mutual distance from two first control slide valves 
(15/1, 15/2)
 and having cam portions (27, 28) deviating from the direction of
movement of the carriage.
Adjusting device according to one of claims 1 to 5, comprising two second control
slide valves (16/1, 16/2) mounted so that they can be displaced in mirror image at an

incline relative to the direction of movement of the carriage and each carrying one
of the two take-down cam parts (12) of a cam system, characterised in that the two

second control slide valves (16/1, 16/2) are each provided at a distance from two
first control slide valves (15/1, 15/2) driven in opposite directions with two

transversely extending control cams (25, 26) open at either end for the entry and
exit of a guide roller (21, 22) and forming two inclined feed surfaces (27, 28) for

the guide rollers (21, 22) completely offset relative to one another in the direction
of movement of the carriage.
