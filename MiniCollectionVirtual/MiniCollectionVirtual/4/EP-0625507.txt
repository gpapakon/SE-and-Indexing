<ABSTRACT>
Urea derivatives of formula (I) 

wherein the valuable groups are as defined in the 
specification, which possess both an ACAT inhibitory 

activity and an antioxidative activity. Those derivatives 
are useful in the prophylaxis and treatment of 

hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new urea derivatives, 
processes for their preparation and their use in medicine. 
More particularly, the invention relates to compounds having 
an inhibitory activity against an acyl coenzyme A 
cholesterol acyltransferase (called hereafter ACAT) and 
having a protective ability against an oxidative 
modification of low density lipoprotein (called hereafter 
LDL). In recent years, interest has been directed to 
the relationship between increase in the level of 
cholesterol in the serum and human health. It 
has been pointed out that the level of cholesterol in the 
serum is associated with the amount of cholesterol deposited 
in the blood vessel system and the deposition of cholesterol 
in the blood vessel system brings about e.g. 
coronary artery lesion, which is responsible for ischemic heart 
disease. Drugs for reducing the level of cholesterol in the 
serum have been developed. These drugs, however, were 
effective in controlling blood cholesterol to an appropriate 
level, but ineffective in inhibiting absorption of  
 
cholesterol from the digestive tracts and deposition of 
cholesterol on the wall of blood vessels. ACAT is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of 
cholesteryl esters from acyl coenzyme A and cholesterol and 
plays an important role in cholesterol 
metabolism 
and its 
absorption from the digestive tracts. It is believed that 
ACAT occurs in the site of mucosa cells of intestinal 
tracts and is active in esterification and incorporation of 
cholesterol derived from the diet. On the other hand, the 
cholesterol deposited on the wall of blood vessels is the 
esterified cholesterol. The cholesterol accumulated in the 
foam cells which plays in important role in the formation of 
atherosclerosis lesion is also esterified cholesterol. The 
enzyme that catalyzes the esterification of cholesterol in 
these sites is also ACAT. Accordingly, the inhibition of ACAT activity 
can result in inhibiting the incorporation in vivo of 
cholesterol derived from the diet and further the formation 
of cholesteryl ester in specified cell sites. Compounds having an ACAT inhibitory activity are 
disclosed in EP 0450660 A1 and EP 0477778 A2. However, 
those known compounds have only an ACAT inhibitory activity 
and give no effect on the oxidative modification of LDL 
causing the foam cell transformation of macrophage which is 
an important phenomenon for the formation of atherosclerosis 
lesion.
