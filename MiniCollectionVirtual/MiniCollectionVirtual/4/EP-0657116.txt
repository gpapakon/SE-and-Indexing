<ABSTRACT>
The inner boot (bootee) is equipped with an outer lining (covering) (8) which is at least partially elastic and the inner face of which is intended to receive correcting pieces (23) for individual adaptation of the volume of the boot to the wearer's foot. The elasticity of the lining is provided, for example, by two elastic strips (13, 14) and the lining preferably has cutouts and notches (10, 11, 12) facilitating positioning and removal of the correcting pieces.
