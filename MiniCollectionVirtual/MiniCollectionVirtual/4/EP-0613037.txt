<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal display apparatus having a 
pair of substrates with a liquid crystal layer interposed 

therebetween is disclosed. Also, a method for 
producing the same and a substrate are disclosed. In 

the liquid crystal display apparatus, an aligning film 
is formed on at least one of the pair of substrates, 

the surface of the aligning film is made rough, 
e.g. by making an underlying layer rough, for 

controlling pretilt angles of liquid crystal molecules 
in the liquid crystal layer which are in contact with 

the surface of the aligning film, and the degrees of 
roughness are different among a plurality of prescribed 

regions. 
In another embodiment, the properties of the aligning film are locally 
set by irradiating the film with light for controlling the pretilt 

angles. 
In still another embodiment, only a portion of the electrode is 
covered with an aligning film, the other portion having no aligning 

film.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing a liquid
crystal display apparatus with a wide viewing angle and
a method for producing the same, and also relates to a
substrate.In a liquid crystal display (LCD), a liquid
crystal layer including liquid crystal molecules is
provided between a pair of substrates. When the
alignment of the liquid crystal molecules is changed,
the optical refractive index of the liquid crystal
layer is also changed. By utilizing the change in the
refractive index, the LCD performs the display. Accordingly,
it is important that the liquid crystal
molecules are arranged as regularly as possible in the
initial state. In order to regularly arrange the
liquid crystal molecules in the initial state, the
surface conditions of the substrates which sandwich the
liquid crystal layer should regulate the interactions
between the liquid crystal molecules and the surfaces.In the method for performing such a regulation
which is currently the most widely used, material
for a liquid crystal aligning film is applied to each
of the surfaces of the substrates which face the liquid
crystal layer. The applied material is dried and
cured, so as to form the aligning film. Thereafter,
the surface of the aligning film is rubbed. There are two types of aligning films for
regulating the alignment of the liquid crystal, i.e.,
an inorganic aligning film and an organic aligning
film. Materials for the inorganic aligning film include
oxides, inorganic silane, metals, and metal
complexes, whereas materials for the organic aligning
film include polyimides. A typical material for the
liquid crystal aligning film which is currently employed
is a polyimide resin. The polyimide resin is
produced in the following manner. A polyamic acid,
which is a precursor for all aromatic polyimides (all
aromatic PI), is first applied to a substrate. Then,
the substrate with the polyamic acid is heated so that
an imidization reaction is caused to occur. As a
result, the polyamic acid is converted into a polyimide
resin. The reasons why the polyimide resin is widely
used for the liquid crystal aligning film material are
the concentration and the viscosity thereof can easily
be adjusted since the polyamic acid has a good solubility,
the polyimide resin has a good applicability, and
that the thickness of the polyimide resin film can be
easily controlled. The produced polyimide resin is
more stable in terms of energy than the polyamic acid.
Accordingly, when the substrate with the polyimide
resin is cleaned by water, the
