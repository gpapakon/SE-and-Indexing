<ABSTRACT>
A feedback circuit (10) for use with a feedback arrangement includes an input 
terminal (12) for receiving a feedback signal from an output of the feedback 

arrangement. An output terminal (14) is coupled to a regulating arrangement 
of the feedback arrangement. A sampling arrangement (16) is coupled to the 

input terminal for providing a delayed feedback signal. A further arrangement 
(18,20,22,24,26,28) is coupled to the output terminal (14) for comparing the 

feedback signal with the delayed feedback signal and with a predetermined 
reference signal, such that the further arrangement (18,20,22,24,26,28) 

disables the regulating arrangement if a certain relationship exists between 
the compared signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to circuits for use with feedback arrangements.In a typical feedback arrangement, a regulator uses an error signal derived from a
feedback loop to control an output of the arrangement by sending a control signal to
control a source generating the output.There is typically a time constant associated with the feedback arrangement, a delay
occurring between the adjustment of the control signal and an associated change in the
output. Thus a transient response may be generated.A problem with this arrangement is that whilst achieving good regulation, the transient
response of the control signal may cause the output to repeatedly overshoot and
undershoot the desired level.Furthermore, a transient control signal may generate a very sharp output change,
producing instabilities in the arrangement.EP-A-447637 discloses a power supply control circuit which has a feedback
arrangement whereby constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) modes of
operation are provided.This invention seeks to provide a feedback arrangement in which the above mentioned
disadvantages are mitigated.According to the present invention there is provided a feedback circuit for use with a
feedback arrangement as claimed in claim 1. In this way, good regulation of the output may be achieved, preventing repeated
overshoot and undershoot of the desired output level and reducing instabilities in the
arrangement.An exemplary embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the
drawings in which:
FIG. 1
shows in block diagram form a feedback arrangement incorporating the
invention; FIG. 2
shows a preferred embodiment of a circuit for use with the feedback arrangement
of FIG. 1;FIG. 3
shows a graph of a typical response of a prior art feedback arrangement; and,FIG. 4
shows a graph of a typical response of the feedback arrangement of FIG. 1.Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a feedback arrangement 5 comprising a voltage
regulator 30, coupled to receive a predetermined reference voltage from a reference
voltage terminal 35. A voltage source 40 is coupled to receive a control signal from the
voltage regulator 30 for providing a regulated voltage to an output terminal 50. A first
feedback path 60 is coupled to the output terminal 50 for providing a fed back output
voltage to the voltage regulator 30. A circuit 10 is also coupled to the output terminal
50 for providing a control signal to the voltage regulator 30. Referring now also to FIG. 2, an input terminal 12 of the circuit 10 provides a
coupling to the
