<ABSTRACT>
A process for converting black-and-white color 
separation information contained in PostScript software 

to color separation information which can drive a color 
output device to print at least two different colors, 

which process comprises determining the position of 
commands in the black-and-white software which define 

the color output for the information on one color 
separation, and changing the command to indicate that a 

color other than black is to be produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to software for use 
with the PostScript language in the production of 
multicolor images for prepress color proofing. Black-and 
White PostScript files are used to generate 
multicolor images useful for printing. One of the most difficult aspects of simulating a 
printed image in a prepress color proof which does not 
actually print images from plates is the reproduction 
of mechanical phenomena or events that occur on press 
and which affect visible characteristics of the printed 
image. One of the more traditional phenomena which 
must be simulated is "dot gain," in which the half tone 
dots are physically spread out during printing, so that 
the size of the dot on the receptor sheet is not the 
same size as the dot on the plate. Dot gain varies 
according to the size of the dot, the type of press 
used, and the inks used, so that a proofing system must 
attempt to adjust for each of these variables which 
affect dot gain. That is no easy task. Another event which takes place during printing is 
color trapping. Color trapping is necessary in the 
design of almost all full color pages. Trapping is a 
method used in the printing industry to allow for the 
slight misregistration of colors that occurs on the 
printing press. When two dissimilar colors are printed 
side by side, a thin area of one color is extended into 
the other color. If the printing press-were to 
misplace the one color slightly away from the other,  
 
the trapping will prevent the white paper from showing 
through the gap. Printing inks are transparent, so the small area 
where the two colors overlap will result in a darker 
color. The human eye is much less sensitive to this 
darker area than to a white gap. The PostScript language is conventionally used to 
draw the text, line work, and color areas describing a 
printed page in many black and white, and color 
printers used in the graphic arts industry as well as 
imagesetters which create film for printing plates or 
proofs to check the accuracy of the page designs. When making film for printing plates, PostScript 
is quite able to reproduce the color trapping needed 
for high quality pages. Since a separate printing 
plate is needed for each color, the PostScript file 
will draw a complete and separate page for each color 
separation. Each color would be represented by a 
single separation page. When making a color proof, PostScript presently is 
not able to reproduce the color trapping on the proof. 
This is because PostScript considers all colors

A process for converting black-and-white color 
separation information in PostScript software of at 

least four different colors to color separation 
information which can drive a color output device to 

print at least four different colors, which process 
comprises determining the position of commands in the 

black-and-white software which define the color output 
for the information, and changing at least three of the 

commands to indicate that a color other than black is 
to be produced. 
The process of claims 1 or 2 in which the at least 
three commands are for the colors cyan, magenta and 

yellow to be produced. 
The process of claim 2 wherein at least one of the 
commands is for a color selected from the group 

consisting of fluorescent color, metallic color, and 
white to be produced. 
The process of claims 1, 2 or 3 wherein said color 
other than black is produced by a thermal transfer 

imaging system. 
The process of claims 1, 2 or 3 wherein at least 
one of said colors other than black is produced by a 

thermal transfer imaging process. 
The process of claim 4 wherein at least one of 
said colors other than black is produced by a thermal 

transfer imaging process.
