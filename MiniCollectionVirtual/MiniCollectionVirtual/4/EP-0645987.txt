<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a suction hood assembly (30) that is attachable to an ultrasonic handpiece (10), as well as to a source of suction (56). The suction hood assembly (30) includes a portion thereof that opens in an area adjacent the ultrasonic tip (16) to provide an area of influence of the suction and thereby recover microdroplets of body fluids, matter and water mist. The suction can be used to control the size of the aerosol envelope (20) generated when the water stream from the ultrasonic device (10) is directed toward the ultrasonic-moving tip (16). The size of the aerosol envelope (20) can be substantially reduced to a small area of operation, thereby minimizing the dispersion of germs, viruses and body fluids for the patient to the surgeon. The suction tube assembly (30) is easily attached or removed from the ultrasonic handpiece (10), is easily manufactured, cost effective and thus is disposable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to medical
and dental ultrasonic devices that generate an aerosol
cloud or envelope, and more particularly to attachments
utilized with ultrasonic devices for recovering the
aerosol cloud generated thereby, and for controlling the
size thereof. Ultrasonic devices are well known in the medical
and dental field for use in tissue removal, or removal
of organic and other types of deposits. When employed
in the practice of periodontics, ultrasonic scalers are
fitted with a pointed tip or end adapted for scraping
calculus or tartar deposits. The ultrasonic vibrations
of the tip facilitate the removal of such deposits on
hard tissue, such as bone or teeth. In this type of
application, the ultrasonic scaler includes a handpiece
with a "pile" housed therein for generating the
ultrasonic vibrations. A replaceable ultrasonic insert,
fitted with the tip, is inserted into the end of the
handpiece and connected to the pile for transferring the
ultrasonic vibrations to the tip. A flow of water is
also directed through the handpiece to cool the
ultrasonic pile as it converts high frequency electrical
energy to the mechanical vibrations. The water absorbs
the heat generated by the pile, thereby maintaining the
pile at an appropriate operating temperature. The water
exits the insert via an orifice, is directed to the tip
and, because of the ultrasonic vibrations of the tip,
generates an aerosol cloud or mist. The water stream
particles that are directed toward the tip, are broken
into microdroplets which can create a large globe-shaped
envelope, ranging in size up to 122 cm (48 inches)in diameter.The aerosol cloud of microdroplets can also include
small tissue fragments and droplets of body fluids,
including blood, which become airborne and, unless
specific precautions are taken by the surgeon or doctor,
can be inhaled. It can be appreciated that various
contagious viruses and other organisms can be
transferred from the patient, via the aerosol cloud, to 
the surgeon. In addition, the aerosol cloud is
disadvantageous for both the patient and the surgeon, in
that after several minutes of utilization of the
ultrasonic device, both the patient and the doctor can
become wet or soaked.Insofar as the water flow through the ultrasonic
device is necessary for cooling, it cannot be
interrupted during the operation of the device without
overheating and potentially damaging the device. It is
also believed that there may be a beneficial result of
the ultrasonic water jet in the area of

An
ultrasonic device (10) comprising an elongate

handpiece (12), an insert
(14), having

a tip (16), an orifice (140) in the end
of the insert (14) through which water spray (18) is jetted

toward the tip and generates an aerosol (20),

a rigid cylinder body (32) insertable on at least a
portion of the handpiece (12), said cylinder body (32) having

opposing first and second open ends (34, 36) said first end (36)
being radially spaced from the insert (14) to define an

annulus (44), said second end (34) fitting securely to the
handpiece (12) for supporting and sealing the cylinder body (32)

to the ultrasonic device (10);
a suction tube (38) arranged between
a source of suction (56) and

a sidewall of the
cylinder body (32) and sealed around an opening (40) in the

sidewall so that when said source of suction (56) is activated
at least a portion of the aerosol (20)

is drawn in via the annulus (44) between the ultrasonic
insert (14) and the cylinder body (32) and extracted via the

suction tube (38); and
control means (58) to vary the amount of suction such that an
envelope (20) of the aerosol surrounding the tip (16) of the

ultrasonic device can be controlled as to size as a
function of the amount of suction applied to the

suction tube (38).
Ultrasonic device of Claim 1,
wherein the first end (36) of the cylinder body (32) has a

different diameter than said second end (34). 
Ultrasonic device of Claim 1, wherein said cylinder body (32)
has a length so that the second end (34) thereof engages the handpiece (12) and the first end (36) of

said cylinder body (32)
is spaced from the end of the insert about 3 millimeters.
Ultrasonic device of Claim 1, wherein said cylinder body (32) is
constructed of a rigid plastic and is removably attachable to the ultrasonic device (10) and is

thus disposable.
