<ABSTRACT>
A silver halide photographic material comprising a 
support having thereon at least one silver halide emulsion 

layer, wherein the emulsion of the silver halide emulsion 
layer comprises a silver halide having a silver chloride 

content of 90 mol% or more containing a transition metal 
of 1×10⁻⁶ mol or more per mol of silver; the material has 

a layer containing a dye subjected to a fine crystalline 
solid dispersion between the silver halide emulsion layer 

and the support; the material has an interlayer comprising 
a hydrophilic colloid and an uppermost layer comprising a 

hydrophilic colloid and solid grains having a mean grain 
size of from 1 to 5 µm, above the emulsion layer; and the 

thickness of the interlayer is at least 0.8 times the 
thickness of the uppermost layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide
photographic material favorably processable in a so-called
"dot-to-dot work" step in a photomechanical process and,
more precisely, to a silver halide photographic material
having improved photographic properties for daylight dot-to-dot
work processing.In the field of printing and duplicating
technology, improvements in the processability of photographic
materials in the photomechanical process or
processing them have been desired for the purpose of
satisfactorily dealing with diversified and complicated
print forms in these days.In particular, the efficiency of processing such
photographic materials has been planned to be improved by
conducting assembly processes and dot-to-dot working
operations in the process in lighter environments. For
this, developments in silver halide photographic materials
for photomechanical process that may be handled in
environments substantially comparable to illuminated rooms
and also developments in exposure printers have been
promoted. Silver halide photographic materials for
illuminated rooms as referred to herein mean photographic
materials to which a light having a wavelength of 400 nm
or more and containing no ultraviolet light components is
applicable as a safelight.Recently, global interests in environmental
problems are increasing, greatly requiring the reduction
in the amounts of replenishers to developers and fixers to
be used in the systems of processing photographic
materials. As one means for reducing the amount of such
replenishers, there is known a method of reducing the
amount of silver to be coated in the photographic
materials, which, however, causes a problem of lowering
the maximum density (Dmax) in the processed photographic
materials. To obtain a high Dmax, while using a small
amount of silver in preparing the photographic materials,
there is known a method of reducing the grain size of the
grains in photographic silver halide emulsions to thereby
increase the covering power of the photographic materials
having such emulsions. Since high-silver chloride
emulsions for dot-to-dot-working photographic materials
for illuminated rooms are not needed to have a high
sensitivity, various studies for planning fine silver
halide grains for these materials have heretofore been
made. For instance, emulsions of fine silver chloride 
grains are disclosed in JP-A-63-183438 (the term "JP-A" as
used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent
application"), JP-A-63-296034, JP-A-63-306436, JP-A-1-108123
and
