<ABSTRACT>
An information system for providing services including traffic and navigation services, as well as other information services to a driver. One version of the system makes use of existing components of a wireless telephone system, for example, by using the input and output capabilities of a telephone handset. Another version is a portable system that includes multiple switches for initiating access to a remote server in one of a number of operating modes. For instance the system has switches for initiating traffic information, roadside assistance, personal information, or emergency modes. The system includes a positioning system for generating position data related to a geographic location of the system, and a wireless communication device. The system also includes an audio output device, such as a speaker for presenting the received information. The system can also include a storage for a unique identification of the information system. This identification is passed to the remote server through the wireless communication device. Another version of the system provides both autonomous and client-server based navigation services in which a removable database supports route planning in a limited area and a remote server supports route planning outside that area.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an information system for
motor vehicles.Vehicle information systems have been developed that
provide various types of information to operators of
those vehicles. In particular, navigation systems have
been developed. One type of navigation system, an
autonomous navigation system, uses an on-board map,
typically stored on a removable medium such as a compact
optical disk (e.g., CD-ROM). The navigation system uses
the on-board map to plan a route from a starting point to
a destination, which is specified by the operator of the
vehicle. Updating an autonomous system's map, for
example to add or correct information, typically involves
replacing the removable medium.In some navigation systems the operator inputs the
desired destination (and the current location, if
required by the system) by entering a spelling of the
destination. Some systems also allow an operator to
select from a stored list of "points of interest," such 
as a list of gas stations or restaurants. Once the
operator inputs the destination, the system plans a route
along the road network to the destination. The route is
typically planned to provide a shortest distance or to
try to provide the shortest travel time. Once the route
is planned, the operator is guided by the system along
the route.Various approaches to route guidance have been used.
A particularly simple approach is to provide the operator
with a sequence of discrete instructions, for instance,
at intersections where the operator must turn from one
street onto another. The operator indicates when he or
she is ready for the next instruction. For example, the
instructions are provided as an audio output, and the
operator says "next" when ready for another instruction.Another approach to route guidance uses a displayed
map on which the planned route and the vehicle's location
are dynamically displayed. The operator uses the map to
decide when and where to turn in order to follow the
planned route.Some guidance approaches are aided by in-vehicle
sensors that are used to estimate the location of the
vehicle. For instance, a magnetic compass is used to
estimate the direction of travel, and a velocity sensor
is used to estimate the distance traveled. In addition,
the location of the vehicle can be estimated using the
Global Positioning System (GPS). In GPS, multiple
satellites emit signals that allow an in-vehicle GPS
receiver to estimate its absolute location.Other types of vehicle information systems have also
been developed. In some systems, traffic related

<CLAIMS>
An in-vehicle navigation system for providing route information
through a road network comprising:


a first stored database including information related to roads in the road
network within a first geographic area; and
an onboard computer programmed to perform the functions of

(a) accepting a specification of a starting and an ending location
in the road network,
(b) if the starting and the ending locations are within the first
geographic area, planning a route through the road network from the starting

to the ending locations without communicating with a remote server computer; and
(c) only if the starting or the ending locations are not within the first
geographic area, communicating with a remote server computer to retrieve a

information related to a route through the road network from the starting to
the ending locations.
The in-vehicle navigation system of claim 1 wherein the first stored
database is stored on a removable storage medium.
The in-vehicle navigation system of claim 1 further comprising a
second stored database including information related to major roads in the

road network within a second geographic area, wherein the first geographic
area includes a common area within the second geographic area, and the first

stored database includes information about roads in the common area that is
not included in the second stored database. 
A method of providing navigation information comprising:

accepting a specification of starting and an ending location in a
roadway network;
accessing a second stored database that includes information related to
major roads in the road network within a second geographic area;
accessing a first stored database that includes information related to
roads in the road network within a first geographic area, wherein the first

geographic area includes a common area within the second geographic area,
and the first stored database includes information about roads in the common

area that is not included in the second stored database;
if the starting and the ending locations are within the first geographic
area, planning a route through the road network from the starting to the

ending locations without communicating with a remote server computer; and
only if the starting or the ending locations are not within the first geographic
area, communicating with a remote server computer to retrieve a information

related to a route through the road network from the starting to the ending
locations.
The method of claim 4 further comprising accepting the first stored
database from a removable storage medium.
