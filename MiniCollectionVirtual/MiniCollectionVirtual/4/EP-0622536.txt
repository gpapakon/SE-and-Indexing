<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
electronic fuel injector systems for internal combustion 
engines, and more particularly, to an electronic fuel 
injector driver circuit for controlling electromagnetic 
fuel injector valves for use on internal combustion 
engines. With the recent interest placed on efficient use 
of space in automotive vehicles, automotive vehicle 
manufacturers have asked designers to give-up more engine 
compartment space for interior passenger compartment space. 
This is known as "cab forward" design and is quickly 
becoming commonplace in the automotive industry today. The 
cab forward design puts a premium on space in the engine 
compartment, while the customer puts a premium on 
performance and power. Styling has also played a role in 
the decay of engine compartment space. Lower hood lines 
with non-existent front grills are very common. All of 
these factors have led to the recent renewed interest of 
applying two-stroke internal combustion engine technology 
to the automotive vehicle. One major hurdle in applying two-stroke internal 
combustion engine technology to the automotive vehicle is 
the air/fuel delivery into combustion chambers of the  
 
engine. The conventional two-stroke internal combustion 
engine has a crankcase which receives the air/fuel/oil 
mixture that is then transferred to the combustion chamber 
during the "power" stroke. This fuel delivery scenario is 
deemed unacceptable in automotive applications where 
governmental regulations are getting increasingly more 
stringent. Clearly, a solution must be derived whereby the 
air/fuel delivery and the crankcase lubrication system are 
separated in a manner similar to four-stroke internal 
combustion engine technology. Recently, a new "external-breathing-direct-fuel-injected" 
two-stroke internal 
combustion engine has been developed specifically for 
automotive vehicles. The engine "breathes" or receives 
fresh air via an external blower and fuel is injected 
directly into the combustion chambers during the 
compression portion of the power stroke. This new fuel delivery system presents challenges 
in the area of fuel injection and control. New fuel 
injectors have been developed to meet the physical 
requirements of injecting pressurized fuel into pressurized 
cylinders, achieving proper atomization, and the like. 
However, these fuel injectors, in order to complete their 
task, must be controlled in a manner which deviates from 
the typical control systems present today. In light of present day
