<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of designing
a pneumatic tire, and more particularly to a method of
designing a pneumatic tire which makes it possible to
efficiently and easily design and develop the structure and
shape of a tire for attaining single-purpose
performance or mutually incompatible performances
of the tire, as well as to determine the best
structure and shape of the tire and design a tire having
improved cost performance.Conventional methods of designing a tire have been
based on experiential rules obtained through repeated
numerical experiments using experiments and computers. For
this reason, the number of trial manufactures and tests
required for development has been enormously large,
resulting in increased development cost and making it
impossible to readily reduce a development period.In general, methods of designing a tire carcass
configuration are broadly classified into the following two
design methods. Presently most tires are designed,
developed, and marketed in accordance with either one of the
two methods.One method of designing a tire carcass configuration is
called a natural equilibrated configuration design method,
in which the cross-sectional shape of a carcass (a cross-sectional
shape of a tire cut in a plane including the
rotational axis of the tire) is determined in such a manner
that tension in tire carcass cords becomes constant
particularly when the tire is fitted onto a rim and is
inflated with air so as to bring the internal pressure of
the tire to a standard level of internal pressure. Namely,
the cross-sectional shape of the carcass at a time when the
tire is vulcanized and cured in a mold is made substantially
identical to the cross-sectional shape of the carcass which
is under the standard internal pressure, so as to prevent
the occurrence of a failure due to internal strains or the
like occurring locally between laminates or in laminated
layers of various reinforcing layers of the tire when the
tire is inflated with air.The other method is called a non-natural equilibrated
configuration design method. As a typical method of
designing a non-natural equilibrated configuration, a 
designing method is known which has already been marketed
under a trade mark called "R COT" proposed earlier by the
present applicant and has been commercially successful.
Unlike the above-mentioned method of designing a natural
equilibrated configuration, this method of designing a non-natural
equilibrated configuration is a designing method
which, conversely, controls the

of the tire and a tire structure, and a constraint other than the design

variable for constraining at least one of the cross-sectional shape of the
tire, the tire structure, a physical amount for evaluating performance,

and a tire size;

objective function to an amount of unit change of the design variable,

and a sensitivity of the constraint, which is a ratio of an amount of
change of the constraint to an amount of unit change of the design 

variable; calculating a value of the objective function when the design
variable is changed by an amount corresponding to the estimated

amount and a value of the constraint when the design variable is

each other at a predetermined probability and of generating a new basic
model of the tire by changing a portion of the design variable of at least 

one of the basic models of the tire; determining the objective function,
the constraint, and the fitness function of the basic model of the tire

with the design variable changed; preserving said basic model of the

predetermined number of the preserved basic models of the tire satisfies

a predetermined convergence criterion; if the convergence criterion is

variable changed, the amount of change of the design variable which
gives the optimum value of the objective function is estimated while

taking the constraint into consideration on the basis of the sensitivity of
the objective function, which is the ratio of the amount of change of the

objective function to the amount of unit change of the design variable,
and on the basis of the sensitivity of the constraint, which is the ratio of

the amount of change of the constraint to the amount of unit change of
the design variable, the value of the objective function when the design 

variable is changed by the amount corresponding to the estimated
amount and the value of the constraint when the design variable is

changed by the amount corresponding to the estimated amount are
calculated, the fitness function is determined from the value of the

objective function and the value of the constraint, said basic model of
the tire and the basic model of the tire with the design variable not
