<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to psyllium husk-containing drink 
mix compositions comprising the divalent cation salt of strong inorganic 
acids selected from the group consisting of magnesium sulfate, 
calcium sulfate, calcium chloride, Zinc sulfate, Zinc chloride and 
mixtures thereof. These salts provide the benefit of reducing the 
gellation rate of the psyllium husk when dispersed in an aqueous 
solution. Products containing psyllium seed husk are known (for example, 
MetamucilÂ®, sold by The Procter & Gamble Company). Such products are 
useful for the benefit of normalizing bowel function and laxation. In 
addition, recent research has demonstrated the effectiveness of 
psyllium seed husk fiber in reducing human serum cholesterol levels 
and in controlling blood glucose levels in diabetics. Psyllium seed husk contains natural mucillage. It forms a 
gellatinous mass on contact with water, and it exhibits poor dispersibility 
and mixability in water. Dispersibility and mixability of 
psyllium husk in aqueous solutions have been shown to be improved by 
utilizing higher levels of sugar, and by coating the husk with 
materials such as maltodextrin. Once dispersed in the aqueous solution, the psyllium husk begins 
to gel with an accompanying increase in the viscosity of the drink 
solution. Typically, the consumer of the psyllium husk suspension 
drinks the liquid suspension in a relatively short period of time 
(less than about two minutes) in order to avoid having to drink an 
aesthetically unacceptable high viscosity liquid (i.e., the solution 
is considered too thick to enjoy drinking or difficult to drink). By 
reducing the psyllium husk particle size it is possible to eliminate 
the gritty texture of the psyllium husk yet maintain efficacy. 
However, the smaller the particle size of the psyllium husk, the more 
the rapid gellation rate is a consumer noticeable concern. It is possible in one way to control the rate of gellation by 
using acids to reduce the pH of the drink mix solution. However, 
typical acids can impart too strong a flavor (e.g., a sour or bitter 
flavor, especially at higher levels which may be desired to maximize 
the reduction in gellation rate) to the solution, and this must be  
 
consistent with the flavor system being used. Obviously, such an 
acidic medium is not suitable for flavor systems which require neutral 
or basic conditions. Also, except in certain controlled circumstances, 
acids are not suited for use in unflavored systems. For these reasons, there continues to
