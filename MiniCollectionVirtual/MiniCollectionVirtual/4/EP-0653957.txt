<ABSTRACT>
A device for mixing two fluids having different temperatures comprises a connecting branch (6) extending into a main pipe (1) from a secondary pipe (2), said connecting branch having at its end positioned in the main pipe a distribution casing (7) with double annular walls, of which an inner wall (9) defines a channel (10) extending axially and centrally in the main pipe (1), and having apertures which allow a fluid (B) to be conducted into and mixed with the fluid (A) passing through the main pipe. The apertures consist of a plurality of small apertures (11) which are formed in the inner wall (9) of the distribution casing (9) and provide intermixing of the two fluids directly in the channel (10) positioned centrally in the main pipe (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device designed 
according to the preamble of the claim and intended for 
mixing two fluids, especially liquids, having different 
temperatures. In the systems of water pipes included in nuclear 
power plants and serving to conduct water to and from, 
inter alia, the reactor and the condenser, there are a 
plurality of points at which water having a certain temperature 
is to be mixed with water having a different temperature. 
This took previously place in simple T-piece 
connections or branch pipe points at which an open branch 
pipe opens directly into an aperture in the circumferential 
wall of a main pipe. At such branch points, the two 
water flows meet in an uncontrolled manner during rather 
intensive vorticity which, inter alia, implies that vortices 
or streaks of water having a certain, e.g. higher 
temperature than other streaks of water move back and 
forth both axially and sideways along the inside of the 
pipe wall of the main in the area downstream of the branch 
point. This means that at least the inside of the main 
pipe is subjected to intermittently repeated variations in 
temperature, leading to the pipe material, which in practice 
in most cases is acid-proof steel, alternately being 
subjected to compressive and tensile stress. This phenomenon, 
so-called thermal fatigue, shows itself in crack formations 
in the pipe material. If the differences in temperature 
between the two intermixed fluids are great, for 
example 50Â°C or more, and the fatigue continues for a long 
time, the crack formation may advance so far as to jeopardise 
security. The inclination to form cracks will be 
especially pronounced in the area of welds which are  
 
frequently to be found in the vicinity of the branch point 
downstream thereof. For the purpose of at least reducing the above-mentioned 
problems, attempts have recently been made to mount 
in the branch point between main and secondary pipes a 
special mixing device serving to control the mixing process 
in such a manner that the number of variations in 
temperature per unit of time along the internal surfaces 
of the pipe walls is reduced. For such mixing, use has 
been made of a connecting branch which extends essentially 
radially into the main pipe from the secondary pipe and in 
whose cylindrical circumferential surface there are formed 
a plurality of small perforations through which the water 
from the secondary pipe flows radially outwards in the 
form of a corresponding number of jets. In one embodiment,

<CLAIMS>
A device for mixing two fluids, especially liquids, 
having different temperatures, comprising a connecting 

branch (6) extending essentially radially into a main pipe 
(1) - through which a first fluid (A) is supplied - from 

a secondary pipe (2) - through which a second fluid (B) is 
supplied, the connecting branch having, at its end positioned 

in said main pipe, a distribution casing (7) with 
double annular walls (8, 9), of which an inner wall (9) 

defines a channel (10) which extends axially and substantially 
centrally in said main pipe, said distribution casing 

being formed with apertures allowing the second fluid 
(B) to be conducted into and mixed with the first fluid 

(A) which passes through the main pipe and the channel, 

characterised
 in that said apertures consist 
of a plurality of small apertures (11) formed in the inner 

wall (9) of said distribution casing (7) and providing 
mixing of the second fluid (B) in the first fluid (A) 

directly in the channel (10) positioned centrally in said 
main pipe (1).
