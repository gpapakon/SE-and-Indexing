<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a Bowden-type cable control having an inner 
core cable (1) movable axially within an outer conduit (2), the outer conduit 

being adapted to extend between two fixed end abutments, and the control 
having a device (3) whereby the effective length of the outer conduit as it 

extends between said end abutments may be adjusted. The adjuster device 
essentially comprises an externally threaded hollow stem (4) which can be 

screwed into and out of a hollow internally threaded sleeve (5), said stem and 
said sleeve forming part of the length of said conduit extending between said 

end abutments, and the core cable passing through and being movable within 
both said sleeve and said stem, the screwing of the stem (5) into or out of the 

sleeve (4) being effective to alter the length of the conduit (2). The external 
thread of the stem (5) is formed with at least one flat extending axially along the 

external surface of the threaded part of the stem. A latching member (6) is 
non-rotably connected to the sleeve (4), the latching member being movable into 

and out of a position in which it engages the flattened portion of the threaded 
stem in such a way as to lock the stem against rotation relative to the sleeve.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cable control of the Bowden type.Such a Bowden type cable control comprising an inner core cable
moving co-axially within an outer conduit has been known for very many years.
They have been employed in a variety of applications, for example in an
automobile, to control the fuel/air supply or to control the gearbox, the brakes or
the clutch. And it is well known that such controls need means whereby
adjustment may be made, for example to compensate for wear of a clutch plate
or a brake pad.Such a Bowden-type of cable control has a substantially inextensible
inner core cable interconnecting a master lever with a slave lever. This inner
core cable is usually pulled against a spring force. The master lever may be for
example, a driver's foot pedal and a slave lever may be for example, a clutch
release lever and one of the advantageous features of a Bowden type cable
control is that it enables the cable to follow an indirect or even tortuous path
between the master and slave levers.In order to enable the inner core cable to function when it follows an
indirect path between the master lever and the slave lever, the substantially
inextensible inner core cable is movable coaxially within an outer conduit which
is longitudinally compressed between two end abutments, one fixed near the
master lever and the other fixed near the slave lever, when the inner core cable
is placed under tension. The outer conduit is constituted essentially in the form
of an elongate tubular member which coaxially surrounds the inner core cable
over a major part of its length. The outer conduit, while being flexible, is
constructed and arranged so that it is capable of sustaining the force imposed by
such tension of the core cable without significant reduction in its length.
Various constructions of such outer conduit are well known in the art.It is well known also (DE-A-3 500 734) that such Bowden-type cable controls can be
adjusted by altering the effective operating length either of the inner core cable
or of the outer conduit. For example, a shortening of the effective length of the
inner core cable has a similar effect to a corresponding increase of the effective
length of the outer conduit; and per contra, the lengthening of the effective
length of the inner core cable has a similar effect to a corresponding decrease of
the effective length of the outer conduit. The present invention relates in particular to a device whereby the
effective length of the outer conduit of a Bowden-type cable control can

<CLAIMS>
A Bowden-type cable control having an inner core cable (1) movable
axially within an outer conduit (2), the outer conduit being adapted to extend

between two fixed end abutments, and the control having an adjuster device (3) whereby
the effective length of the outer conduit as it extends between said end

abutments may be adjusted, and wherein the adjuster device essentially
comprises an externally threaded hollow stem (5) which can be screwed into and

out of a hollow internally threaded sleeve (4), said stem and said sleeve forming
part of the length of said conduit extending between said end abutments, and

the core cable passing through and being movable within both said sleeve and
said stem, the screwing of the stem (5) into or out of the sleeve (4) being

effective to alter the length of the conduit (2); characterised in that the external thread
of the stem (5) is formed with at least one flat extending axially along the

external surface of the threaded part of the stem, and wherein a latching
member (6) is non-rotatably connected to the sleeve (4), the latching member

being movable into and out of a position in which it engages the flattened
portion of the threaded stem in such a way as to lock the stem against rotation

relative to the sleeve.
A control according to claim 1 and in which when the latch (6) is
moved out of its locking position engaging the flattened portion of the stem (5),

the stem can be rotated relative to the sleeve (4), in or out, to adjust the
effective length of the conduit (2).
A control according to either of claims 1 or 2 and wherein the adjuster
device (3) is located mid cable, that is between two lengths or sections (2a and

2b) of the outer conduit as it extends between the two end abutments.
A control according to claim 3 and wherein the sleeve (4) is connected,
and non-rotatably secured, to one length or section (2b) of said conduit and the

stem (5) is rotatably secured by a swivel joint (15) to the second conduit length
or section (2a).
A control according to claim 1, and wherein the adjuster device is
provided at one end of the conduit of the Bowden-type cable control, the sleeve

being connected, and non-rotatably secured, to one of the end abutments, and
the stem being rotatably connected to the conduit at one end thereof. 
A control according to any one of the preceding claims and wherein the
stem (5) and the sleeve (4) with its integral latch (6) are plastics mouldings.
A control according to claim 6 and wherein such mouldings have end
fittings which can receive, or be swaged or otherwise fixed to, the ends of outer

conduit sections of the Bowden-type control cable.
A control according to any one of the preceding claims and wherein the
latch (6) is connected to the sleeve (4) by an integral strip (17) constituting a

bending hinge.
A control according to any one of the preceding claims and wherein the
threaded part of the stem (5) is foursquare in cross-section, with four flats each

running axially along its threaded portion; and when embracing the stem, the
latch (6) lockably engages three of the four flats being a press fit and clipping

over the threaded part of the stem (5).
