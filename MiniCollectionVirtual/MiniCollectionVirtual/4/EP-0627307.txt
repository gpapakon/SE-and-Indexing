<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a substructure for a rotary web-fed printing machine and to a method for installing a rotary web-fed printing machine on such a substructure, which is designed with a foundation (18), with supporting elements (2) standing vertically on the foundation and forming a lower storey, with horizontal longitudinal members (9) resting on the vertical supporting elements, and with modular table-top elements (1) which form a table top and which are supported on both sides on the horizontal longitudinal members and carry printing and/or folding units (20,21), according to the invention the underside of each table-top element being provided with at least one vertical guide face (10) which serves as a vertical guide on the vertical walls of the longitudinal members for placing the table-top elements onto the longitudinal members.
