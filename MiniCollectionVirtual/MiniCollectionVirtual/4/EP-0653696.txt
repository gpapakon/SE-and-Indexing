<ABSTRACT>
A method of touch control of cursor position for a display device 
[30]
 having 
a touch sensitive screen 
[26]
 determines, upon contact of the screen by a pointer 

[34]
, whether cursor data exists within a display memory 
[24]
 at addresses related 
to the contact point. If cursor data exists, a cursor mode is initiated so that all 

movement of the pointer across the touch sensitive screen results in the cursor 
apparently moving with the pointer on the display device. Once contact is broken 

with the touch sensitive screen, the cursor mode is controlled conventionally with 
a knob.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cursors for waveform/graphics displays, 
and more particularly to touch control of cursor position for a display device using 
a touch sensitive display screen. Currently cursors are positioned on displays by using buttons and knobs at 
a control panel. In this manner a cursor, which is a pointer to a particular point 
on a display identifying a feature of interest, may be moved to any point on the 
display screen. For waveform display devices this means that the cursor may be 
positioned at a particular point on a waveform so that certain information about 
that point, such as magnitude, or in reference to that point, such as duration, may 
be determined. Touch screens are commonly used in display devices to select items from 
a menu displayed on the screen, or to select a region of a display for further 
processing. An example of further processing is a zoom function which may be 
implemented about a contact point on a touch screen, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,755,811 issued July 5, 1988 to Keith R. Slavin entitled "Touch Controlled 
Zoom of Waveform Displays" and incorporated in the VM700 Video 
Measurement Set manufactured by Tektronix, Inc. of Wilsonville, Oregon, United 
States of America.  
 JP-A-1125612 (Abstract) discloses a cursor at one 
point on the screen that can be replaced by a "touch" mark 
where the screen is touched, which may be an entirely 
different position on the screen from the cursor mark. The 
"touch" mark can be dragged to a desired position and when 
contact is removed from the screen, the "touch" mark 
reverts to a cursor mark. What is desired is touch control of cursor positions 
so that an operator may interact intuitively with the 
display without the need for using buttons and knobs. According to this invention there is provided a method 
of touch control of cursor position on a display device as 
claimed in claim 1 herein.  
 Accordingly the present invention provides a method for touch control of 
cursor position for a display device using a touch sensitive screen. With a cursor 
being displayed on a display screen, an operator touches the screen at the current 
position of the cursor with an appropriate pointer, such as a finger. Contact with 
the screen initiates a search to determine what is at the contact point on the 
display within a tolerance range. If the cursor is determined to be at the point 
of contact, then the display device enters a cursor mode so that further activities 
are related to the cursor. As the pointer

<CLAIMS>
A method of touch control of cursor 
(32)
 position on a display device 
(30)
 
having a touch sensitive screen 
(26)
 comprising the steps of: 

determining from an initial contact point 
(1)
 by a pointer 
(34)
 on the 
touch sensitive screen 
(26)
 whether a cursor 
(32)
 is positioned at the initial contact 
point; and if the cursor is positioned at said initial contact point 
updating the cursor position, as the pointer moves from the initial contact 
point in contact across the touch sensitive screen, to correspond to an instantaneous 

point of contact during the movement so that the cursor appears to move on the 
display device with the pointer. 
The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the determining step comprises the 
steps of: 


determining whether the pointer is in contact with the touch sensitive screen; 
identifying the contact point as the initial contact point and converting the 
initial contact point to a cursor position datum; and 
comparing the cursor position datum with a current known cursor position 
to determine whether the initial position includes the cursor. 
The method as recited in claim 2 wherein the updating step comprises the 
steps of: 


determining whether the pointer has moved to a new contact point on the  
 

touch sensitive screen; 
identifying cursor addresses for the display memory 
(24)
 based upon the new 
contact point; 
writing the cursor into the cursor addresses for the new contact point when 
the display memory is updated; and 
repeating the determining, identifying and writing steps immediately above, 
with the new contact point becoming the initial contact point, so long as the pointer 

is in contact with the touch sensitive screen.
