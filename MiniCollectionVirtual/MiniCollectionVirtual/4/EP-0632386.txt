<ABSTRACT>
A digital system includes a number of digital 
subsystems interconnected by a shared bus structure that is 

mutually exclusively accessible for communicating data between 
the subsystems. The system is structured to be tested by 

pseudo-random scan test methodology. Each subsystem includes 
a counter that, during scan test periods, provides an enable 

signal to the bus access or driver circuitry of the associated 
subsystem. A scan test operation is preceded by pre-loading 

each counter with a predetermined state so that, initially, 
and throughout the test period, one and only one digital 

subsystem will drive the shared data bus. Each scan sequence 
(comprising a scan in, an execution cycle, and a scan out of 

the pseudo-random test strings) will result in the counters 
being clocked once so that a new subsystem will be enable to 

drive the bus the next sequence, permitting the bus access 

circuitry of each subsystem, and the bus itself, to be tested.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed generally to 
testing digital apparatus such as is found in data processing 
systems. The invention relates more particularly to test 
techniques in which sequences of pseudo-random test patterns 
are shifted ("scanned") into and out of digital apparatus, 
producing resultant signatures from which can be determined 
whether or not the apparatus under test will function without 
fault. In particular, the invention provides a method, an 
apparatus implementing that method, for functionally scan 
testing a digital system of the type including a bus structure 
that is accessible by individual units on a mutually exclusive 
basis. The advent of large scale and very large scale 
integration (LSI and VLSI) produced a variety of techniques of 
for testing the very large amounts of digital circuitry that 
can found in integrated circuits (ICs) and combinations of ICs 
(e.g., as may be found on printed circuit or other types of 
boards and systems). One such technique involves application 
of a variety of known test signals to the IC or combination of 
ICs (hereinafter "digital system") and observing the output 
signals produced in response to determine if what was expected 
was produced by the digital system. An offshoot of this 
approach, and one that is becoming increasingly popular, 
involves designing the elemental memory stages of the system 
(i.e., single bit storage such as flip flops, latches, and the 
like) to be capable of functioning in one of two modes: a 
first or "run" mode in which the memory stage operates in its 
capacity for which it was incorporated in the digital system 
(e.g., a component of the system, operating to receive, store,  
 
and pass on system information bits in response to normal 
logic system control signals); and a second or "scan" mode in 
which a number of the memory stages are intercoupled in series 
to form one or more extended shift registers or, as more 
commonly referred to in the art, "scan strings" or "scan 
chains." One method of using these scan strings involves 
forming known test patterns ("vectors") that are put in place 
in the digital system by shifting (scanning") them into the 
system using the scan chains. The system is then allowed to 
run for a period of time (e.g., one or more clock periods), 
and the state of the system (i.e., the content of each memory 
stage) removed for observation, again using the scan chains. There are a number of variations on this approach, one of 
which involves using the scan chains to place the
