<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a control apparatus (20) for use 
in an automotive air conditioning system which includes a variable 

capacity-type refrigerant compressor (11). The automotive air 
conditioning system comprises a refrigerant circuit (10) including a 

refrigerant compressor (11) with an externally controlled, variable 
capacity control mechanism; an evaporator (14) connected to a suction 

chamber of the compressor (11); and a control apparatus (20) which 
controls refrigerant circuit operation. The control apparatus (20) 

includes an adjusting device for adjusting a control point of the 
compressor (11) suction chamber pressure. During operation of the 

automotive air conditioning system, the control point of the compressor 
(11) suction chamber pressure is adjusted to effectively maintain the 

temperature of air immediately downstream from the evaporator (14) at 
the set temperature. In one situation in which the automotive air 

conditioning system is operated in a static thermodynamic condition of 
the evaporator (14) the control point of the compressor (11) suction 

chamber pressure is adjusted to effectively converge the temperature of 
air immediately downstream from the evaporator (14) to the set 

temperature. In another situation in which the automotive air 
conditioning system is operated in a dynamic thermodynamic condition of 

the evaporator (14), the control point of the compressor (11) suction 
chamber is also adjusted to effectively converge the temperature of air 

immediately downstream from the set temperature. Accordingly, the 
passenger compartment of the automobile can be more effectively air 

conditioned during operation of the automotive air conditioning system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automotive air conditioning system. 
More particularly, it relates to a control apparatus for controlling operation of an 
automotive air conditioning system which includes an externally controlled, variable 
capacity-type refrigerant compressor. Control apparatus for controlling operation of an automotive air 
conditioning system, which include an externally controlled, variable capacity-type 
refrigerant compressor, are well known in the art (US-A-4 934 157). 
In prior art embodiment, the capacity 
of a refrigerant compressor is adjusted to control air temperature Te immediately 
downstream from an evaporator during operation of an automotive air conditioning 
system. Te is maintained at the set temperature Tset by sending an electric signal having 
an amperage, which is determined by the proportional-plus-integral-plus-derivative 
control action (hereinafter "PID control action") of a conventional control apparatus, to 
an externally controlled, variable capacity control mechanism of the compressor. In general, the operation of the automotive air conditioning system is 
divided into a first situation in which the automotive air conditioning system is operated 
in a static thermodynamic condition of the evaporator and a second situation in which 
the automotive air conditioning system is operated in a dynamic thermodynamic 
condition of the evaporator. In the first situation, heat load on the evaporator is slightly 
increased or decreased in response, for example, to the slight changes in the rotational 
speed of an evaporator fan caused by slight changes in electric load on the automobile's 
battery, or by slight changes in air temperature immediately upstream from the 
evaporator. On the other hand, in the second situation, heat load on evaporator is 
quickly increased or decreased by large amounts in response, for example, to changes 
in the rotational speed of the evaporator fan, e.g., changes in the amount of air flow 
which passes through an exterior surface of the evaporator, or a change in the 
automotive air conditioning mode, such as a switch from a passenger compartment air 
circulation mode to an outside air intake mode or vice versa. In the conventional automotive air conditioning system described above, 
a coefficient of the PID control action of the control apparatus is fixed at one constant  
 
value during operation of the automotive air conditioning system. If, however, the 
coefficient of the PID control action of the control apparatus is selected
