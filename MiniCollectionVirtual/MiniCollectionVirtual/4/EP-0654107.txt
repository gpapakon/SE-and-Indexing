<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein is a tub apparatus (10) comprising a foamed, resiliently compressible, plastic tub wall (12) having an inner side and an outer side, the tub having an interior (34) to receive liquid, and ports (30a, 31a) extending through the wall (12). The tub apparatus (10) further includes a plastic pack (60) having a cavity formed therein for receiving, and protectively enclosing, a pump unit (45). A water circulation system comprising a tubular duct structure (43, 36) connects the pump unit (45) with the ports (30a, 31a) for circulating water between the tub interior (34) and the pump unit (45).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to hot tubs
or spas, and more particularly to a low-cost,
lightweight, insulated, semi-rigid plastic spa, which
is easily portable, and hot water supply means
therefor.Conventional hot tubs are heavy, non-portable,
and expensive in their construction; also,
excessive electrical and heat energy is required for
their operation. There is need for a greatly improved
spa structure with the unusual advantages in
construction, modes of operation, use and transport,
and results, as are now made possible by the present
invention, as will appear.There is also need for pump units, and
housings for same, to be used in combination with such
hot tubs or spas.It is a major object of the invention to
provide a pump unit for hot tub or spa metting the
above needs.In US-A-4,981,543, there is disclosed tub apparatus comprising:
a) a foamed, resiliently compressible,
plastic tub wall having an inner side and an outer
side, the tub having an interior to receive liquid, and
ports extending through the side wall,b) a plastic pack having a cavity formed
therein, c) a pump unit received in the cavity and protectively enclosed by the
plastic pack;d) and tubular duct means connected with the pump unit and
extending from the cavity to the ports for circulating liquid between the tub interior
and the pump unit.
In accordance with the present invention there is provided such a tub
apparatus characterised in thate) said pack includes a plastic base and a plastic cover received on
said base, said base and cover consist of foamed plastic material, and the cavity
is formed between said base and said cover;
   and further characterised byf) a control means received in said cover and connected with said
pump unit, said control means being accessible from the exterior of the cover for
controlling the operation of the pump unit;
   and further characterised byg) a flexible jacket closely fitting about said base and cover, said
ducting extending through said jacket, said jacket having an opening via which
said control means is accessible from the exterior of the pack.As will be seen, the plastic pack is
typically located at the exterior of the tub wall, the
ports being at upper and lower elevations in the tub
side wall; the pack preferably including a plastic base
and a plastic cover received on the base, the pump
received in the cavity in the base.It is another object to provide the base and
cover of the pack to consist of lightweight, foamed
plastic material, with a flexible jacket fitted closely
about the
