<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a diffuser (5) for a turbojet engine, the latter comprising a compressor intended to deliver compressed air F and an annular combustion chamber (6) comprising an external shell (4) and an internal shell (3), connected by a chamber bottom (8) and by a cap (10) equipped with orifices (11) for feeding air to the chamber bottom (8), said diffuser (5) being interposed between said compressor and said chamber (6), at a distance from the latter, said cap (10) separating the air flow F delivered by said diffuser (5) into a flow Fo feeding the chamber bottom (8), a bypass flow Fe on the external shell (4) and a bypass flow Fi on the internal shell (3), characterised in that said diffuser (5) comprises a non-circular outlet, in which a plurality of conduits (18) separated by radial partitions (17) open, said conduits (18) being distributed radially in three groups of conduits (18i, 18a, 18e) delivering the elementary flows of air, distributed circumferentially and directed towards the zones to be fed (11, 12, 13) of the combustion chamber (6).

<CLAIMS>
Turbojet comprising, in succession along its
longitudinal axis of symmetry, a compressor intended for

supplying compressed air F and an annular combustion
chamber (1) comprising an outer shroud (7) and an inner

shroud (6) which are connected by means of a chamber
bottom (8) in which fuel injectors (9a, 9b) are mounted,

and by means of a cap (10) provided with orifices (11)
for feeding air to the chamber bottom (8), a diffuser (5)

being interposed between the said compressor and the said
chamber (1) at a distance from the latter and being

intended for reducing the flow velocity of the airstream
F coming from the compressor, the said cap (10) separating

the airstream F supplied by the said diffuser (5)
into a stream Fo feeding the chamber bottom (8), a stream

Fe passing by on the outer shroud (7) and a stream Fi
passing by on the inner shroud (6), the said diffuser (5)

comprising a non-circular outlet, into which open a
plurality of ducts (18) separated by radial partitions

(17), the said ducts (18) being distributed in three duct
groups (18i, 18a, 18e) supplying substantially equal

airstreams to the streams Fi, Fo and Fe respectively, the
ducts of each group supplying elementary streams distributed

circumferentially and directed towards the zones
(11, 12, 13) of the combustion chamber (1) which are to

be fed, characterized in that some of the said partitions
(17) are integrated into the guide blades of the

compressor.
Turbojet according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the diffuser (5) comprises ducts distributed 

radially in three duct groups (18i, 18a, 18e) separated
by radial partitions (17).
Turbojet according to Claim 1, characterized in
that one duct (18a) feeding the chamber bottom alternates

with two ducts (18e, 18i) divergent radially between two
successive partitions, the said two ducts being separated

by a guide wedge (20).
Diffuser according to Claim 1, characterized in
that it comprises alternately, between two successive

partitions, one duct (18a) of a first duct group and two
divergent ducts
 (18e, 18i) separated by a separating
wedge (20) and belonging respectively to the second and

third duct groups.
Diffuser according to Claim 1, comprising an
outlet which is of substantially sinusoidal shape and is

delimited by an inner wall (19a) and an outer wall (19b)
which are connected by the radial partitions (17),

characterized in that it is produced in one piece by
injection moulding.
