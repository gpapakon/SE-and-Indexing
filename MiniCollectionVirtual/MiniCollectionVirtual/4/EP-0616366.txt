<ABSTRACT>
A structure for mounting a heat sink (50) onto an 
integrated circuit package (20) mounted on a printed circuit 

board (10) is constructed such that a guide member (30) having a 
frame portion (30A) and 
support post portions (30B) is fixed to the 
printed circuit board (10), and the heat sink (50) is seated on an 

inner periphery of the guide member (30) such that the heat 
sink may be closely contacted with the integrated circuit 

package (20), and then a cover (60) is fixed to the guide member (30) 
such that it covers over outer peripheral edge portions 

of an upper face of the heat sinks (50). This structure is 
high in cooling efficiency and is easy to mount.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a mounting structure
for a heat sink onto an integrated circuit package mounted
on a printed circuit board.In recent years, portable electronic apparatus
such as, for example, lap-top personal computers appear
widely on the market as electronic apparatus for which
miniaturization and high reliability are required. In
order to achieve a high performance of electronic apparatus
of the type mentioned, it is necessary to use one or
more integrated circuit packages having a great amount of
heat generation. Therefore, in order to assure a heat
radiation property of an integrated circuit package
having a great amount of heat generation, a heat sink is
used when an integrated circuit package is to be mounted
onto a printed circuit board. A heat sink is required to
be mounted such that it is closely contacted with certainty
with a heat radiation face of an integrated circuit
package in order to prevent an increase of the heat
resistance by contact, and it is desired to optimize the 
mounting structure for a heat sink onto an integrated
circuit package.FIG. 17A is a top plan view of a conventional
mounting structure for a heat sink onto an integrated
circuit package, and FIG. 17B is a side elevational view
of the same. In the present conventional example, an
integrated circuit package 101 is mounted in a little
floating condition on a printed circuit board 103 by
soldering pins 102 of the integrated circuit package 101
to a conductor pattern not shown of the printed circuit
board 103 while depressions 106 are provided at upper
face edge portions of a heat sink 105 having heat radiation
fins 104, and the heat sink 105 and the integrated
circuit package 101 are held at the depressions 106 of
the sink 105 and lower face edge portions of the integrated
circuit package 101 by clips 107 having a substantially
C-shaped section and made of a resin or the like
(refer to, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,099,550).FIG. 18A is a top plan view of another conventional
mounting structure for a heat sink onto an integrated
circuit package, and FIG. 18B is a side elevational
view of the same. In the present conventional example,
pins 112 of an integrated circuit package 111 are
mounted on a printed circuit board 114 by way of a frame 
113 made of an insulator such as a resin. The frame 113
having a substantially rectangular shape as viewed in
plan has a pair of projections 115 which project sidewardly
at locations in the proximity of a diagonal line
of an upper face thereof. A heat sink 117 having heat

An assembly of an integrated circuit package,
a heat sink for the integrated circuit package, and a

mounting structure for mounting said heat sink onto the
integrated circuit package when the integrated circuit

package is mounted on a printed circuit board, said
mounting structure comprising:


a guide member having a frame portion and a
plurality of support post portions, said frame portion

having an inner periphery corresponding to an outer
periphery of said integrated circuit package and

support post portions protruding from said frame
portion in a direction perpendicular to said printed

circuit board, said guide member being fixable to said
printed circuit board, said heat sink being non-adhesively

seated on said integrated circuit package
such that a side surface of said heat sink is closely

contacted with an inner face of each of said support
post portions;

   
characterised in that
 said guide member is made of
aluminum.
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein 
said support post portions of the guide member protrude

in upward and downward directions of said guide member;
and

   lower faces of said support post portions are
fixable directly to said printed circuit board.
An assembly according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein said support post portions are integrated with

said frame portion.
An assembly according to claim 2, wherein the
portions of said support post portions which protrude

in the upward direction are integrated with said frame
portion while the other portions of said support post

portions which protrude in the downward direction are
formed as separate members from said frame portion.
An assembly according to any preceding claim,
further comprising a cover fixed to said guide member

at said support post portions such that said cover
covers over outer peripheral edge portions of an upper

face of said heat sink. 
An assembly according to claim 5, wherein
said cover is formed from a resilient plate member

whose portions between portions thereof corresponding
to said support post portions have a shape curved

toward said heat sink side.
An assembly according to claim 5 or 6,
wherein said cover is screwed to upper faces of said

support post portions.
An assembly according to claim 5, 6 or 7,
wherein said cover has pawls at portions thereof

corresponding to said support post portions; and

   said support post portions have a shape by which
they are engaged by said pawls.
An assembly according to any of claims 5 to
8, further comprising means for mounting an end of said

cover for pivotal motion on said support post portions;
and

   means for removably engaging the other end of said
cover at said support post portions. 
An assembly according to any preceding claim,
