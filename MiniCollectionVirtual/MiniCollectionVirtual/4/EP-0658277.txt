<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a flexible, conducting plastic electrode and a process for
the preparation of the same. The electrodes have application in redox flow batteries, particularly
vanadium redox flow batteries, as well as in other electrochemical applications such as
electrodepositing and electrowinning.The desired characteristics for electrode materials which are to be used in redox cells and other
electrolytic processes include: low electrical resistivity, good mechanical properties and chemical
stability and optionally low weight and low volume. The electrode material should not be attacked by
reactants or products during cell operation. Thus there is a need for an electrode material which has
good mechanical properties to withstand the hydraulic pressure and cell assembling operation without
cracking and which is solution impermeable so that penetration and attack of the metal current
collector (in end-electrodes) and loss in current efficiency (due to electrolytes crossing the bipolar
electrodes) is low.Objects of the present invention are to provide a flexible, conducting plastic electrode and a
process for the preparation of the same.The present inventors have surprisingly found that by combining a thermo-plastic polymer, an
elastomeric polymer and a conductive filler material, a superior flexible, conducting plastic electrode
is produced which has good physical strength, chemical stability and electrical conductivity. In
particular, the inventors have found that by combining, for example, high density polyethylene
(HDPE) resin, an elastomeric polymer such as, for example, styrene-ethene/butene-styrene (SEBS)
block copolymer and conductive filler material such as carbon black particles or a mixture of carbon
black particles and graphite fibres, a commercially useable plastic electrode is produced.According to a first embodiment of this invention there is provided a conducting electrode
comprising a flexible conducting plastic material and a further electrode component which is a metal
mesh, a metal sheet, a metal foil, or a graphite felt; wherein the plastic material comprises:
a. a conductive filler material;b. a thermoplastic polymer which has moderate to high crystallinity or a glass temperature
(Tg) above the operating conditions of the electrode; andc. an elastomeric polymer;
wherein the amount of a. is such that the plastic material has a resistivity of no more than 3.991
ohm.cm and the degree of crosslinking of b. with c. is such that the electrode is flexible and has high
