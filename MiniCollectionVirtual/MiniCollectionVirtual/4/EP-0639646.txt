<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel method
for the quantitative determination of glucose-6-phosphate
utilizing an enzymatic cycling reaction. The
present invention also relates to a novel analytical
reagent for use in the above-mentioned quantitative
determination.In recent years, in the analysis of biological
samples for the purpose of clinical diagnosis, an
enzymatic method has increasingly been adopted in place
of a chemical method because the enzymatic method is
superior to the chemical method in specificity for
chemical substances to be detected. Among the enzymes
which are widely used in the enzymatic analysis is
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49), which
catalyzes the following reversible reaction.
D-glucose-6-phosphate + NAD(P)+ ⇄
D-glucono-δ-lactone-6-phosphate + NAD(P)H + H+This enzyme is used in combination with other
enzymes for the quantitative determination of ATP, 
glucose and the like and for the coupling assay of
enzymes, such as creatine kinase and the like. For
example, in the quantitative determination of glucose,
glucose is reacted with hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) in the
presence of ATP to thereby produce D-glucose-6-phosphate,
and the produced D-glucose-6-phosphate is then
reacted with D-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in the
presence of NAD(P) to produce D-glucono-δ-lactone-6-phosphate
and reduced NAD(P). In this case, the amount
of the reduced NAD(P) produced by the above reaction
is, generally, spectrophotometrically measured in terms
of an increase in absorbance at 340 nm. Alternatively,
it has been proposed to measure the amount of the
reduced NAD(P) by a method in which the reduced NAD(P)
is reacted with diaphorase or nitroblue tetrazolium to
thereby produce a formazan pigment and the amount of
the produced formazan pigment is then analyzed. This
pigment, however, is insoluble and, therefore, this
method in which the reduced NAD(P) is converted to a
pigment is unsuitable for use in automatic analysis.
Another method has also been reported in which thio-NADP
is employed in place of NADP (Extra-edition of
Journal of Medical Technology, Vol. 22, p. 1232, Japan,
1978). This method using thio-NADP has a sensitivity
which is about twice those of the conventional methods. In addition to the above applications, the glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase, which has a wide variety
of applications in the field of clinical diagnosis,
is used for such applications as the measurement of the
activity of α-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1), phosphoglucomutase
or phosphohexose isomerase (EC
