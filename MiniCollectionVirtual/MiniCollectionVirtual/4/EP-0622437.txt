<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polyurethane adhesive 
composition excellent in acid resistance and hot water 
resistance. More specifically, it relates to a 
polyurethane adhesive composition in the manufacture of 
composite films by lamination of various plastic films, 
metal foils and so forth, which is excellent in 
adhesive properties, acid resistance and hot water 
resistance. In recent years, multilayer composite films having 
two, three or four layers have been developed for use 
as packaging materials for foods and so forth by 
laminating one or more plastic films such as 
polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, polyester and 
polyvinyl chloride films, and a metal foil, such as an 
aluminum foil, and are in wide use. For the adhesion of such plastic films or metal 
foils, use of an adhesive agent prepared by 
incorporating an oxy acid of phosphorus or a derivative 
thereof, epoxy resin and a silane coupling agent into a 
composition containing an organic polyisocyanate and an 
organic polyol has already been proposed [JPB 
S61(1986)-4864). And, use of an adhesive agent prepared by 
incorporating a polybasic acid anhydride having at 
least two acid anhydride groups in the molecule into a 
mixture of an organic polyisocyanate and an organic 
polymer polyol has also been proposed [JPA S61(1986)-47775]. Further, use of an adhesive agent prepared by 
incorporating an oxy acid of phosphorus or a derivative 
thereof, a carboxylic acid compound or its anhydride 
and epoxy resin into a mixture of an organic  
 
polyisocyanate and an organic polyol has also proposed 
[JPA H2(1990)-84482). However, packaging materials produced by using 
such adhesive agents as mentioned above are not fully 
satisfactory in bond strength and are disadvantageously 
insufficient in heat resistance, or chemical resistance 
such as acid resistance and alkali resistance. For 
instance, when a package containing a free fatty acid-containing 
food showing high acidity retort-sterilized 
with hot water of a high temperature of at least 135Â°C 
was subjected to a long-term preservation test, it was 
found that the metal foil-plastic film bond strength 
decreased and, at the same time, the strength of the 
packaging material itself decreased, and, in extreme 
cases, complete delamination take place and cause the 
metal foil to have pinholes, which in turn decrease the 
air barrier property intrinsic to the metal, thus the 
intended long-term preservation of foods cannot be 
achieved. Furthermore, when vinegar or a highly acidic food 
with a
