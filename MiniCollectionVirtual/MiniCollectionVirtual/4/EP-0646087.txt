<CLAIMS>
Biodegradable collagen-based collecting or transporting containers in the form of
a sack or bag for refuse, agricultural products, fertilisers and soil conditioners as

well as animal feed, characterised in that they contain at least 50%, related to the
dry weight, collagen fibres and the material has a tear resistance of at least 10 N

at 70% relative moisture.
Collecting or transporting containers according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the material additionally contains other proteins, hydrocolloids, starches,

celluloses, polysaccharides or hydrophilic, synthetic environmentally-friendly
polymers.
Collecting or transporting containers according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the collagen fibre material is present in sheet form.
Collecting or transporting containers according to Claim 1 to 3, characterised in
that the germ content of the material is below 10,000 cfu/g [colony-forming

units/g].
Collecting or transporting containers according to Claim 1 to 4, characterised in
that the material is totally convertible into gelatine in the event of thermal

hydrolysis in an aqueous medium. 
Collecting or transporting containers according to Claim 1 to 5, characterised in
that at least one open end of the container is sewn up, bonded, stuck together or

closed by means of a clip.
Collecting or transporting containers according to Claim 1 to 6, characterised in
that at least one open end of the container is provided with a quick acting

closure.
Collecting or transporting containers according to Claim 1 to 7, characterised in
that it has an inner covering or coating with an environmentally-friendly

polymer.
Utilisation of the collecting or transporting containers according to Claim 1 to 8
for storing or transporting agricultural products, fertilisers or soil conditioners,

household or industrial waste or animal feed.
Utilisation according to Claim 9 as a transporting container for animal feed,
consumable by the animal together with the feed.
