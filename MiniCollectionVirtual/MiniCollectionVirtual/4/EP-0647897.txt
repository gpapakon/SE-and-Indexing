<ABSTRACT>
A personal computer includes a frame unit and a top cover mounted 
to pivot on the frame unit. In one version of the computer, the top 

cover pivots upward and outward to the rear of the system as it is 
opened. In another version, the top cover pivots upward to the side. 

One or more DASD storage devices may be mounted to extend downward from 
the top cover. A planar board is attached atop the lower side of the 

frame unit, where flexible mounting hardware allows the attachment of one 
of several types of planar boards. A central support structure includes 

a riser card plugged into a connector of the planar board, and a number 
of card connectors into which option cards can be plugged for electrical 

connection with the planar board. The central support structure also 
includes a bracket extending along the rear of the computer, having slots 

through which port connectors of the option cards can extend. The 
central support structure is held in engagement with the connector of the 

planar board by the top cover when this cover is closed. When the top 
cover is open, the DASD storage devices may be easily replaced, the 

central support structure may be unplugged from the planar board, and the 
planar board can be easily replaced or serviced. A front surface of the 

computer includes a door, which is opened by rotation outward and 
downward, to be slid inward, providing access for the replacement of 

media in the storage devices. This door and the top cover are separately 
lockable using a multi-function lock.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the mechanical structure of a personal
computer and, more particularly, to providing configurational flexibility
and/or improved access to media and components within a personal
computer.Personal computer systems typically include electronic circuits
mounted on a planar board, with various other circuits mounted on option,
or feature, cards plugged into the planar board by means of connectors.
This method allows the variation of features of the computer system by
varying the option cards installed within the system. In some personal
computer systems, the processor chip is also mounted on a card plugged
into the planar board. In a desk-top type of system, the planar board is
fastened in place to the system frame near the bottom of the system. The
option cards extend upward from the planar board, being plugged directly
into the planar board, or being plugged into an upward-extending riser
card that is in turn plugged into the planar board. Various
electromechanical devices within the system, such as diskette drives and
hardfiles are typically also installed above the planar board.A typical personal computer system also includes a number of other
subassemblies installed above the planar board. Such devices may include
the direct access storage devices (DASD devices) used to provide data and
program storage in most personal computers. These devices include both
devices with removable media, called floppy drives, and devices with
fixed media, called hardfiles. A typical personal computer includes one
or two such devices with removable media, each of which has a slot to
which access must be available for the removal and replacement of
magnetic media.As a result of such configurations, desk-top personal computer
systems must be almost completely disassembled before the planar board
can be removed and replaced. This requirement causes particular
difficulties because the planar board typically has the highest failure 
rate among system components. Particular problems are associated with
the removal of option cards connected to peripheral devices, since the
cables to such devices must be disconnected before the cards can be
removed. Thus, much time is wasted in disassembly and reassembly of
components in the event of a planar problem, which may occur during the
process of building and testing the computer in a factory, or during the
subsequent operation of the computer in the user's office. Furthermore,
in the user's office the additional desk space, required for the
placement of various
