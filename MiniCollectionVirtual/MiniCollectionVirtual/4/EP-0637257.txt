<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a respiratory support system (10) which includes a suction catheter device (41), a suction control valve (79), and a ventilator manifold (11). The catheter device (41) includes a proximal end connector (72) having a valve (75) therein which prevents air flow through the catheter (54) until the suction control valve (79) is attached thereto, and a distal end connector (40). The suction control valve (79) includes an actuator (113) which is linearly movable between a first position to a second position. The valve also includes a rotatable valve core (135) which can be rotated by the actuator (113) to a third position to disable its linear movement and to open an ancillary access port. When the actuator (113) is in the first position, atmospheric air can pass through the valve (79) and into the suction pressure source in such a manner that a "hissing" auditory signal is generated, indicative of the presence of suction pressure within the valve (79). The ventilator (11) includes an access port (15) for attachment and detachment of the suction catheter device (41) thereto. The access port (15) has a normally closed valve (16) therein. The placement of the specially designed connector (40) of the suctioning device (41) in the access port (15) forces the normally closed valve (16) to an open position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to
a respiratory support system according to the
preamble of claim 1.Respiratory support systems used for the ventilation of
critically ill patients are now commonly used in medical
facilities. Typically, a prior art respiratory support
system includes a tracheal tube positioned either directly,
or through the nose or mouth, into the trachea of a patient,
a manifold connected to the tracheal tube at one port
position thereof, and a source of breathable gas connected
at a second port thereof. The purpose of the respiratory
support system is to assist the patient in maintaining
adequate blood oxygenation levels without overtaxing the
patient's heart and lungs.While a patient is attached to the respiratory support
system, it is periodically necessary to aspirate fluid from
the patient's trachea or lungs. In the past, in order to
accomplish aspiration, it has been necessary to disassemble
part of the respiratory support system, either by removing
the ventilator manifold therefrom or by opening a port of
the manifold and inserting a small diameter suction tube
down the tracheal tube and into the patient's trachea and
lungs. The fluid was then suctioned from the patient and 
the suction catheter was removed and the respiratory support
system reassembled. However, due to the interruption of
respiratory support during this procedure, a patient's blood
oxygen often dropped to an unacceptably low level, even when
other previously known breathing assistance efforts were
simultaneously provided.One solution to the above problem, which is generally
exemplary of the prior art, is shown in U.S. Patent No.
5,073,164 to Hollister et al., which includes a ventilator
manifold having an access port therethrough which is adapted
to receive a connector of the suction catheter device. The
suction catheter device positions a catheter within the
ventilator manifold without substantial manifold pressure
loss. The suction catheter device includes an envelope
which is positioned around the catheter portion thereof in
order to prevent contamination of catheter surfaces intended
to be inserted into the patient's trachea and lungs.Although this type of ventilator manifold and suction
catheter device connection allows continuous respiratory
support of the patient during suctioning of fluid from the
patient's trachea and lungs, it nevertheless has several
drawbacks associated with its use. For example, removal of
the suction catheter device from the manifold, such as for
the purpose of replacing the
