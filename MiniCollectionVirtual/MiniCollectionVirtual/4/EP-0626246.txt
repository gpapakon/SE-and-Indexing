<ABSTRACT>
A polymer resin extrusion head is provided for molding 
multilayer tubular articles with resins of unequal 

viscosities wherein such resins are not combined into a 
multilayer structure until a point near the outlet of the 

extrusion head to minimize unstable flows. In some 
embodiments, the inner layer of the multilayer structure is 

added last to help minimize unstable flows. In preferred 
embodiments, unstable flows are minimized by combining all 

components of the multilayer structure within 4'' of the 
extrusion head outlet.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to resin extrusion apparatus 
and particularly to extrusion heads for producing tubular 
articles such as parisons. Parisons, tubular extrusions of resin and plastic 
which are subsequently blow molded to form bottles, are 
formed in the prior art by various apparatus, some 
including extrusion heads which extrude successive layers 
of plastic resin onto a mandrel. Such devices must be of 
a size which allows insertion into a blow molding apparatus 
for bottles. A typical multilayer parison extrusion head 
has separate inlets for receiving heated and plasticized 
resin from individual screw heaters and extruders and has 
separate channels for distributing and expressing the 
respective plastic resins in successive layers on the 
mandrel. Each channel includes an annular equalization and 
distribution chamber surrounding and spaced from the 
mandrel for receiving the plastic resin from the 
corresponding inlet. From the equalization chamber, the 
plastic resin is fed through a frustoconical transfer 
passage downward and inward into a tubular extrusion 
channel formed around the mandrel. This annular extrusion 
channel exits through an inwardly or outwardly flaring 
annular die, which includes a conical core member which may 
be moved longitudinally relative to the outer member of the  
 
die to vary the thickness of the wall of the extruded 
tubular article. One particularly useful and successful extrusion head 
for forming tubular articles, such as parisons, is 
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,798,526. This head includes 
one or more individual annular extrusion modules surrounding 
respective successive portions of a step or tapered 
mandrel to form the annular extrusion channel, which 
receives one or more successively extruded plastic resin 
layers from the modules. Each module has a pair of members 
with mating surfaces, wherein the equalization and distribution 
chamber and frustoconical transfer passage are 
formed. The die modules are separated from each other by 
annular air spaces to prevent heat transfer that can 
degrade low temperature resins. While the prior art apparatus is generally efficient 
and effective in the extrusion of multilayer parisons, 
improvements are desired. Conventional extrusion heads have considerable annular 
flow lengths for the multilayer structure, with annular 
flow lengths as long as 7.62cm-12.7cm (3-5") between the addition of each 
subsequent layer. This creates a severe restriction when 
materials of unequal viscosity are used. Depending

<CLAIMS>
A polymer resin extrusion head for extruding 
tubular articles, comprising: 


a longitudinally extending mandrel assembly (24), 
said mandrel assembly terminating in a bottom portion; 
a plurality of coaxial annular extrusion modules 
(6,11,16) positioned longitudinally and successively 

along the mandrel assembly so as to define an annular 
channel between the mandrel assembly and the modules, 

wherein said annular channel terminates at an extrusion 
head outlet from which the tubular article is extruded, 

wherein each annular extrusion module has a resin inlet, 
an annular outlet for extrusion of a tubular resin layer 

into the annular channel and a passage from the resin 
inlet to the annular outlet for receiving and 

distributing resin; and characterized in that 
 
   the annular outlets (47,48,49) are 

longitudinally and radially spaced apart from each other 
and longitudinally spaced apart from the extrusion head 

outlet so as to sequentially combine the extruded resin 
layers into a tubular multilayer structure within the 

annular channel and within a longitudinal distance of 
10.16 cm (four inches) of the extrusion head outlet, with 

a last extruded tubular resin layer being added to the 
tubular multilayer structure within a longitudinal 

distance of 2.54 cm (one inch) of the extrusion head 
outlet. 
An extrusion head as in claim 1, wherein the 
passages within the annular extrusion modules extend 

spirally from the resin inlet gradually opening into an 
annular space which leads to the annular outlet. 
An extrusion head as in claim 1, wherein the 
annular outlets are configured so that the last tubular 

resin layer is the innermost layer of the tubular 
multilayer structure.  

 
An extrusion head as in claim 1, 2 or 3, 

wherein the annular extrusion modules are each 
frustoconical in configuration and the respective 

passages within the annular extrusion modules each extend 
spirally from a respective resin inlet and gradually 

opens into an annular space that leads to the annular 
outlet. 
An extrusion head as in any of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein the annular extrusion modules are spaced 

longitudinally along the mandrel assembly so as to form 
air spaces between adjacent modules that are sufficient 

to avoid direct heat transfer between the adjacent 
modules.
