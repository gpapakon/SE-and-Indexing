<ABSTRACT>
The profile of the valve stop (22) of a 
discharge valve (20) is configured such that the portion 

facing the free length of the valve member (21) has an 
increasing radius portion and a decreasing radius 

portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a discharge valve assembly
including a valve stop and a valve member having a tip and
a root and having a clamped length at said root and a free
length extending from said clamped length to said tip. A
discharge valve assembly of this type is disclosed in JP-A-60-8577.In positive displacement compressors employing
valves, the valve members may cycle hundreds of times per
minute. Valve stops are commonly employed to protect the
valve member from being overstressed by limited movement of
the valve member. For example, under liquid slugging
conditions, the mass flow during a cycle is such that the
valve member would be excessively displaced if a valve stop
was not present. Engagement of the valve stop by the valve
member can be a significant source of noise. Specifically,
a discharge valve stop in a rolling piston rotary
compressor has been identified as one of the major noise
sources through the impact kinetic energy transmission of a
discharge valve member. The impact between the valve and
valve stop generates significant noise radiation at the
natural frequency of the valve stop due to transmission of
valve kinetic energy to the valve stop and the compressor
shell, where the valve stop is excited at its natural
frequency.A discharge valve stop in a rotary compressor has
been identified as a major noise source through the impact
kinetic energy transmission of a discharge valve. A primary
reason for the intensity of the noise in conventional valve
stop designs is that the tip of the valve member impacts
the valve stop before the root does and because total
valve/valve stop contact occurs, typically during the last
tenth of a millisecond of a one millisecond opening stroke.As disclosed in JP-A-60-8577 compressor discharge
valve noise is reduced by the valve which is provided with
a soft spring characteristic at the beginning of the
opening stroke and a stronger spring characteristic at the 
end of the opening stroke. This is achieved in JP-A-60-8577
by a deformable retaining plate interposed between the
valve and the valve stop. The retaining plate has a sharper
curvature than the flexion curve of the valve from its
support point to its free end, and sharper than the valve
stop to create a void between the retaining plate and the
valve stop. The spring characteristic of the valve is soft
before it contacts the retaining plate and then stronger
when the retaining plate deforms to reduce the size of the
void.The object of the invention is to provide an
improved reduced noise

<CLAIMS>
A discharge valve assembly (20) including a
valve stop (22) and a valve member (21) having a tip and a

root and having a clamped length at said root and a free
length extending from said clamped length to said tip,

characterized in that said valve stop has along said
free length a profile which, as compared to a standard constant radius stop profile, has a first portion which is of

an increasing radius relative to a fixed center point (E) and
which transitions into a second portion which is of a

decreasing radius relative to said center point.
The valve assembly according to claim 1,
characterized in that said second portion has a radius less

than said first portion beyond a point generally
corresponding to 90 % of said free length.
The valve assembly according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that

engagement between said valve member and said stop takes
place over essentially an entire opening movement of said

valve member thereby maximizing the duration of, and
minimizing the amount of, kinetic energy transfer from said

valve member to said stop.
The valve assembly according to any one of
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the valve stop (22)

has a natural frequency and
engagement between the valve member (21) of the valve

stop (22) avoids exciting said natural frequency.
