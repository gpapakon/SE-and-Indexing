<ABSTRACT>
A thrust washer and retainer ring combination is provided for a vehicular 
transmission (100) of the type having adjacent mainshaft gears (12) and (18) floating 

about a mainshaft (2) that have respective flanges (40) and (42) extending radially 
inwardly theretowards. A thrust washer (32) is disposed in a groove (38) between 

flanges (40) and (42) and a pair of retainer rings (28) and (30) are respectively disposed 
in grooves (34) and (36) adjacent a side of flanges (40) and (42) facing away from each 

other to prevent gears (12) and (18) from moving axially away from each other. 
Retainer rings (28) and (30) have an axial width "X" that is greater than the axial width 

"Y" of thrust washer (32) such that thrust washer (32) cannot be inadvertently received 
into retainer ring grooves (34) and (36) and the radial height of thrust washer (32) is 

preferably high enough to prevent it from being received into retainer ring grooves (34) 
and (36).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a improved combination of a thrust washer
ad a pair of retainer rings operative to transmit axial thrust to the mainshaft of a
vehicular transmission that has been selectively imparted to one of a pair of adjacent
gears during the process of clutching the gear to the mainshaft.Transmissions featuring floating transmission mainshaft gears such as associated
with twin countershaft transmissions are well known and examples of which can be
found in U.S. Patents Number 3,237,472; 3 283 613; 3,425,290; ad 3,885,446.Such transmissions generally feature a plurality of floating mainshaft gears that
encircle the mainshaft and are supported and driven by countershaft gears, typically two
countershaft gears, that are mounted on a pair of countershafts disposed spaced-apart
parallel relationship on opposite sides of the mainshaft.The mainshaft gears are characteristically clutched to the mainshaft by means of a
clutch mechanism that slides along external splines extending axially along the mainshaft
and has radially outwardly extending teeth or splines that meshingly engage internal teeth
or splines on the mainshaft gear so as to cause rotation of the mainshaft when the
mainshaft gear is clutched thereto.A problem, long ago recognized, has been the potential for transfer of axial thrust
to a floating mainshaft gear closely adjacent to the floating mainshaft gear being clutched
to a mainshaft by a axially moving clutch assembly. In view of such, a variety of
solutions have been devised over past years for transmitting axial thrust to the mainshaft
that has been imparted to a mainshaft gear by an axially moving clutch mechanism rather
than the mainshaft gear adjacent the gear being clutched to the mainshaft.Such solutions have generally been in the form of gear retainer(s) of one type or
another that characteristically limit axial movement of the mainshaft gears to prevent 
them from engaging each other whether or not one of them is being clutched to the
mainshaft.One example of a retainer assembly for limiting axial movement of a transmission
gear is disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,397,905.
Here however, a costly and expensive pivotable woodruff key is
required to lock a thrust collar onto external splines of the mainshaft to prevent a gear
from moving axially.An example of a splined thrust washer for transmitting axial thrust from a gear
set to a propeller drive shaft is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,894,621.
Here, a splined thrust washer (52) is slid
along the shaft splines to a

<CLAIMS>
In a transmission mainshaft thrust washer (32) and retainer ring (28, 30) combination of the
type wherein radially inward extending flanges of a pair of adjacent mainshaft gears (12, 18)

selectively clutchable with the mainshaft (2) are prevented from moving axially away from each
other by first and second retainer rings (28, 30) respectively disposed in annular grooves (34, 36) adjacent

the sides of the respective gear flanges (40, 42) facing away from each other and are prevented
from moving axially towards each other by a thrust washer (32) disposed in an annular groove (38)

in the mainshaft between the sides of the respective gear flanges (40, 42) facing towards each
other and operative to transmit axial thrust to the mainshaft (2) that is created during the

process of clutching the respective gears (12, 18) thereto, wherein the improvement is
characterized by;

the first and second retainer rings (28, 30) being interchangeable with each other but not
with the thrust washer (32) as a result of both retainer ring grooves (34, 36) having respective axial

widths that are substantially the same and wider than the axial width of the thrust washer
groove (38) so as to accommodate an offset in the side of the respective rings facing towards

the mainshaft gear flanges (40, 42) resulting in a portion each retainer ring having an axial width
within the retainer ring groove (34, 36) that is larger than both the axial width of the thrust

washer groove (38) and the remaining portion of the retainer ring.
The retainer ring and thrust washer combination of claim 1 wherein the thrust
washer (32) is further prevented from interchangability with the retainer rings (28, 30) by having an

outer diameter that is larger than the diameter of the retainer ring by an amount effective
to create an interference with internal teeth on the mainshaft gears operative to be

meshingly engaged with teeth of a clutch mechanism operative to clutchingly engage the
gear (12, 18) with the mainshaft (2) for rotation therewith.
