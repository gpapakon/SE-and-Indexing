<ABSTRACT>
A process for heating at low pressure a mass (10), according to which this mass is placed in a closed heating chamber (3) and a first wall zone of this heating chamber is connected (5) to a suction source (6), characterised in that, at a distance from this first wall zone (3A), a second wall zone (13) is formed as a grille or perforated plate having orifices of a size smaller than 3 mm approximately, and in that flames (19) are generated which lick this grille or perforated plate on the opposite side of this heating chamber. The invention applies for example to the heating of insulated chambers of a system for treatment by thermolysis.
