<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel coating 
compositions containing hydrolyzed cellulose esters and 
acrylic resins. More particularly the present invention 
relates to aqueous dispersions that are stable over long 
periods of time containing a hydrolyzed cellulose ester 
and an acrylic resin that has free acid functionalities 
that are at least partially neutralized. Cellulose esters are valuable polymers which are 
useful in many plastic, film, coating and fiber 
applications. In coatings applications, cellulose 
esters are generally applied from organic solvent 
solutions. Because of health and environmental concerns 
from volatile organic content (VOC) of solvent based 
coatings, water based coatings are becoming more in 
demand. There are waterborne coating formulation 
available containing polyesters and acrylics, but few 
contain cellulose esters due to their hydrophobic nature 
making them difficult to disperse or emulsify. When 
applied from organic solvent solutions as wood, leather, 
and metal coatings, cellulose esters impart desired 
properties such as, improved pigment dispersions, 
improved metallic flake orientation, improved solvent 
release, and higher gloss coatings. Cellulose esters 
also function as an excellent rheology control agent in 
solvent coating formulations. It would be very 
desirable to incorporate these excellent properties of 
cellulose esters into waterborne coating systems.  
 Previous attempts to produce a water dispersible 
cellulose ester coatings system have involved oxidation 
of cellulose ester, grafting of acrylic acid to 
cellulose esters, and reaction of anhydrides such as 
phthalic anhydride or succinic anhydride with the 
hydrolyzed cellulose esters to provide modified 
cellulose esters containing free carboxyl groups such as 
disclosed in the following U.S. Patents; U.S. 4,435,531; 
U.S. 4,590,265; U.S. 4,960,814; U.S. 4,252,697. 
However, these processes are complicated resulting in 
expensive aqueous dispersion. It would, therefore, be 
very desirable to be able to easily produce aqueous 
dispersions containing unmodified cellulose esters. Other cellulose ester systems used in water based 
coating are disclosed in U.S. 3,318,714 (describing 
pigment dispersions in a cellulose acetate butyrate 
lacquer systems) and U.S. 3,220,865 (describing an 
emulsion coating composition based on cellulose acetate 
butyrate, and plasticizers). In addition to low VOC, stability of the dispersion 
is an important feature for these aqueous dispersions to 
be useful
