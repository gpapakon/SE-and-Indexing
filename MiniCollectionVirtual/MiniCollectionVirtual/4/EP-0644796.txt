<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an ion trap
sampling device comprising a vacuum chamber, an inlet
sampling nozzle for said vacuum chamber, and an outlet
from said vacuum chamber.The present invention relates, in general, to
atmospheric pressure ionization techniques, and
more particularly to an interface structure which
utilizes atmospheric pressure ionization
techniques such as electrospray, ion spray, and
corona discharge ionization in combination with a
mass analyzer.The development of various spray
techniques for forming ions from analytes was a
significant advance in the field of mass
spectrometry, for these techniques, and
particularly those that employ electric fields to
impart charges to droplets in the spray, permit
the formation of highly charged ions (particles)
from high molecular weight species. These highly
charged ions are characterized by mass/charge
ratios that are well within the range of values
accessible to most modern mass analyzers.In addition, the combination of mass
analyzers with on-line separation methods, such as
liquid chromatography, for mixtures in solution is
becoming increasingly important. Mass
spectrometry has long been recognized for its high
sensitivity, but its use as a detector in
combination with on-line separators of condensed-phase
analytes has been limited at least in part
because of the incompatibility of mass
spectrometry to commonly used reversed-phase high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC). The 
incompatibility arises, in part, from the use of
a wide variety of buffer additives in the
conventional HPLC eluent, high percentages of
water in the eluent, and flow rates that are
typically maintained at 1 cm3/min.,with standard
4.6 mm inner diameter HPLC columns. The HPLC
eluent composition and its flow rate into the mass
spectrometer have challenged the development of a
routine and analytically rugged interface between
the HPLC column and the mass spectrometer (LC/MS
interface).Historically, electron ionization (EI)
mass spectra were produced from solutions
introduced into a mass spectrometer at less than
one mm3 per minute. Later, chemical
ionization (CI) mass spectra were generated by the
introduction of aqueous solutions at 1-5 mm3/min.
into a CI mass spectrometer ion source. For this
early work, the direct liquid introduction LC/MS
interface was developed and commercially marketed
through the early 1980's. This approach produced
a modest beginning for LC/MS problem solving in
several areas, but its limitation was the need for
a 100-1 post column split, as
