An accelerator-pedal apparatus for a motor vehicle with a pedal plate, pivotably mounted 
on a pedal mounting in the form of a housing, and an adjustment device connected to the 

pedal plate, 
characterized in that
 the pedal mounting comprises an elongate housing 
which comprises two half shells (2, 3) and in which components of the adjustment device 

(4) are held on bearing points (5, 6) formed integrally on the inside and catching tabs (9, 
10) extending transversely on the outside of the half shells (2, 3) and common centring 

domes (11, 12) formed integrally on an undersurface (
F
) of the half shells (2, 3) facing 
the vehicle body are provided for fastening and for fixing the position. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the components of the adjustment 
device (4) are arranged mounted beforehand on the bearing points (5, 6) of a half 

shell (2 or 3) and can be secured by means of the second mounted half shell (2 or 3), 
wherein the half shells (2, 3) are fixed in position by positioning pins (7, 8) and sleeves 

(7a, 8a) corresponding thereto. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the accelerator pedal (21) 
is held pivotably in bearing lugs (23, 24) - provided on each half shell (2, 3) outside the 

housing - by way of pins (22) formed integrally at the side. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that
 the assembled half 
shells (2, 3) form chambers (25, 26 and 27), wherein a transmission member, cooperating 

directly with the pedal (21) by way of a thrust rod (18) and comprising a deflecting lever 
(13) and an optionally used entrainment disc (14), is held on the bearing point (5) in a 

middle chamber (26) between end chambers (25 and 27). 
An apparatus according to Claim 1 or one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in
 
that a kick-down switch (
K
) is arranged between receiving means in one upper end 
chamber (25), and a deflecting pulley (16) for a suspended throttle cable (17) is arranged 

on the further bearing point (6) in the further lower end chamber (27). 
An apparatus according to Claim 1 or one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in, 
that
 the chambers (25 to 27) are partially separated from one another by way of transverse 
walls (28, 29) reinforcing the housing, and apertures for a cable line (34) of a 

cruise-control device and for a pull rod (15) connecting the components (13 and 16) are  
 

provided in the transverse walls. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1 or one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in 
that
 the two half shells (2, 3) have two integrally formed half shells (30, 30a), between 
which a sheathing (17a) of the throttle cable (17) can be secured in an annular groove 

(31) by way of a bead ring (32). 
An apparatus according to Claim 1 or one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in 
that
 the half shells (2, 3) have a flange (33) extending on the outside in the longitudinal 
direction of the housing and following a contour of the base area of the vehicle body and 

forming a flush termination for a floor carpet.
