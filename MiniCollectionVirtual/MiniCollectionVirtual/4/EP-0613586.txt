<ABSTRACT>
A piezorotary motor with a stator (4) and a rotor (9) has a first expanding element (1) and two second expanding elements (1', 1'') mounted on the rotor (9) between two legs (13, 14) of the stator (4). Rows of advance elements (3) are mounted on the rotor (9) on both sides of the first expanding element (1). These rows bear against the first expanding element (1) and are linked to the rotor (9). A deformable ring (5) is secured against rotation to one leg (14). When the first expanding element (1) is driven, it deforms the ring (5) and is thus held between the legs (13, 14). At the same time, one row of advance elements (3) is expanded and the other row is contracted, rotating the rotor (9) with both expanding elements (1', 1''). Both expanding elements (1', 1'') which deform the ring (5) are then driven, the first expanding element (1) is no longer driven and the rows of advance elements (3) are driven in counterphase to the preceding drive, moving the first expanding element (1) away from the advance elements (3).
