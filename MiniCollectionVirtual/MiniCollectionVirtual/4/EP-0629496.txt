<ABSTRACT>
A tool set type powder compacting press is proposed 
which is simple in construction and reliable. The driving 

shafts coupled through coupling shafts with the tool 
holding plates, that is, the punch plates are provided at 

the press side. Further, coupling means having removable 
joints is provided between the driving shafts and the punch 

plates. No driving means is provided at the tool set side. 
Since the driving mechanisms are integrated at the press 

side, the whole arrangement will have a simple 
construction. This will also increase the reliability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a powder compacting press 
which uses tool sets to manufacture powder compacts such as 
sintered parts. With a powder compacting press, a plurality of tools 
(including a die, a core and punches) are used to make a 
compact with a complicated shape having two or more steps. 
In the tool sets, a plurality of tools are mounted on 
respective tool holding plates. The tool holding plates 
are guided by guide rods to keep parallel to one another. 
Some of the tools are operated by driving mechanisms such 
as a cylinder attached to the tool holding plates or by 
mechanical interlocking mechanisms.  
 From GB-A-2 025 834 there is known a powder compaction press 
which comprises a matrix holder plate, one or more punch holder 
plates and a core holder rod. This press further comprises 
a system of upper punch holder and means for the controlled 
displacement of said elements during the phases of compression, 
extraction of the moulding and return to the position 
for filling of the die cavity.  
 In order to increase the rate of operation of the 
press, it is a general practice to provide a plurality of 
tool sets on a single press. Therefor, driving mechanisms 
have to be provided as many as the tool sets. When 
changing the setup, it is necessary to couple the driving 
mechanisms to a hydraulic, pneumatic or electric power 
source and connect signals. Also, the operation control 
mechanism and the tool position adjusting mechanism have to 
be attached to each tool set. This will increase the cost 
of tool sets and the time used to couple the driving source 
and the signals. Further, there is a problem that between  
 
a plurality of tool sets there is a difference in function 
with respect to one another. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
tool set type powder compacting press which obviates this 
problem. According to the present invention, there is provided 
a tool set type powder compacting press with the features of claim 1. No adjusting mechanism for operation or positioning 
is provided at the tool set side. Therefore, controls of 
speed, position and power by means of electric or hydraulic 
servo control, by hydraulic/pneumatic pressure control or 
by other control are carried out only for the driving 
shafts. If there is a play or rattling at the connection  
 
between the tool holding plate of the tool set and the 
driving shaft in the press, it may unduly affect the 
quality of the products. Clamp mechanisms may be provided 
so that the joint portions

<CLAIMS>
A tool set type powder compacting press for use with a 
tool set including an upper punch (1a - 1c), a lower punch 

(1d - 1f) and a die (4), at least one of said upper punch 
(1a - 1c) and said lower punch (1d - 1f) comprising a 

plurality of tools, said tool set further comprising tool 
holding plates which are as many as said tools and hold 

said respective tools, wherein said press is provided with 
driving shafts (5a - 5g) for operating said respective 

tool holding plates, said driving shafts (5a - 5g) being 
provided with means for controlling the operation and 

position of said tool holding plates and wherein coupling 
means for coupling said driving shafts (5a - 5g) with said 

tool holding plates is provided, 
characterized
 in that 
said driving shaft (5a - 5g) comprises a numerical servo 

control system. 
A tool set type powder compacting press as claimed in 
claim 1 wherein said coupling means comprises a clamp (9) 

which imparts an axial force to said joint to eliminate 
any gap between said driving shaft (5a - 5g) and said tool 

holding plate. 
A tool set type powder compacting press as claimed in 
claim 1 or 2 wherein said joint comprises a T-joint (7) 

adapted to fit in a T-groove (6).
