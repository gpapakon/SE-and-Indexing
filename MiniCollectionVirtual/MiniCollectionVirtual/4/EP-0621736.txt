<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for transmitting digital information by cable between an exchange of a telecommunication network and subscribers connected to this exchange is specified. The digital transmission path is conducted for each subscriber to a transfer point accessible to the subscriber, at which the subscriber can optionally connect his devices by means of corresponding adaptors for the utilization of a maximum transmission rate available at the transfer point. For switching through the respective transmission rate, channel schedulers which can be controlled from the exchange are inserted into the digital transmission paths.

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for the digital transmission of messages by cable between an
exchange (EXCH) belonging to a telecommunications network and users (US)

connected to the exchange, in which there are channel allocators (CA) inserted in
the digital transmission paths to switch through or enable a transmission rate, which

rate can be altered if required, between the exchange (EXCH) and a given user
(US), which allocators can be controlled from the exchange (EXCH) by means of

suitable control commands, 
characterised in that
the digital transmission path for each user (US) is run to the user's own,
dedicated handover point (P) which is accessible to the user concerned,
optical fibre cables are used as the transmission medium between the
exchange (EXCH) and the handover points (P) of all the users (US),
extending from the handover point (P) of each user (US) is a bus cable (B) to
which the different units belonging to a user (US) can be connected, with

adapters (AA, SU) inserted, in parallel with one another, which adapters
provide interfacing signals intended for the individual units,
each user (US) can connect in, as desired and separately from one another,
different units which use the same allocated transmission rate which may be

anything up to the maximum transmission rate available at the handover
point (P),
the channel allocators (CA) are situated at the handover points (P).
