<ABSTRACT>
A two-stage electrostatic filter includes an ionization section which is arranged in an upstream part of a throughflow passage (28) and includes a wire-like corona electrode (31) which is disposed in an ionization chamber (29) and connected to one pole of an electric high voltage source (16). The filter further includes a target electrode (21; 37) which is spaced from the corona electrode (31) and connected to another pole of the high voltage source. A capacitor separator (30) is located in a downstream part of the throughflow passage (28) and includes a first and a second group of electrode elements (32, 33) which are placed side-by-side in spaced-apart relationship. The electrode elements (32) of the first group are placed alternately with the electrode elements (33) of the second group and are adapted to lie on a potential which is different from the potential on which the electrode elements (33) of the second group lie. The ionization chamber (29) has a target electrode surface (37; 21) which is disposed both upstream and downstream of the corona electrode (31). When measured perpendicularly to the upstream-downstream direction of the throughflow passage (28) and to the longitudinal axis of the corona electrode, the distance of the corona electrode (31) from the target electrode surface is at least four times the distance between neighbouring electrode elements (32, 33). The capacitor separator (30) and the ionization chamber (29) form a disposable unit made of a non-metallic material, preferably a cellulose fibre material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a two-stage electrostatic 
filter (electrostatic precipitator), and more specifically 
to a two-stage electrostatic filter of the kind defined 
in the preamble of claim 1. Electrostatic filters, also called electrostatic dust 
separators, are used both in industrial production plants, in 
which case the electrostatic filters are in the form of large 
and expensive apparatus, and in apparatus in which air is 
cleansed for comfort purposes, such as air-conditioning 
apparatus and other apparatus for use in domestic dwellings, 
offices and other places of work, schools, hospital care 
facilities, motor vehicles and other places in which the air 
can be cleansed with comparatively much smaller apparatus. In this latter case, in which it is mostly the air 
present in occupied places or the air entering such places 
that is to be cleansed, the filters used have hitherto 
essentially comprised mechanical filters provided with fibre 
filter cloths, textile or paper-based fibre-filter mats or 
electret filter mats. Electrostatic filters have also been used to a certain 
extent in this latter case. These electrostatic filters have 
normally been two-stage electrostatic filters by which is 
meant electrostatic filters in which the solid or liquid 
particles, aerosols, which are carried by the airflow and 
which are to be extracted therefrom are electrically charged 
in a separate ionization section while the actual separation 
process takes place in a capacitor separator positioned 
downstream of the ionization section. The present description 
is concerned with two-stage electrostatic filters, unless 
stated otherwise. Mechanical air filters almost exclusively use disposable 
or exchangeable filter elements. Thus, those parts of the 
filter which primarily capture the separated material and 
which are therefore the filter components that are most subjected 
to dirt and clogging constitute units which can be 
readily exchanged. These elements, or units, are used until 
they can no longer fulfil their intended function in a satisfactory  
 
manner and are then replaced with a new unit and 
scrapped. Hitherto, disposable units have not been used in electrostatic 
filters; at most, the capacitor separators 
typically comprised of aluminium plates and high-grade 
insulating material have been given the form of cassettes 
which can be removed readily from the filter apparatus for 
cleaning purposes. The task of cleaning these cassettes, 
however, is both time-consuming and expensive and
