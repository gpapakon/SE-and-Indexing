<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical recording 
medium for recording and reproducing information at a high 
density using a light beam. Optical recording mediums are capable of high-density 
recording in a non-contact and random-access manner and may 
find promising use as a large-capacity digital memory. An optical recording medium of this kind has a 
structure in which a recording layer is formed directly on a 
substrate or on a dielectric layer previously formed on the 
substrate. The substrate is formed of polycarbonate (PC), 
polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), epoxy resin, amorphous 
polyorefine, or glass or glass/2P. Alternatively, grooves 
of glass/2P substrate may be formed in a glass substrate 
surface by a 2-P (photo-polymer) method. As the recording layer, an amorphous magnetic thin film  
 
formed of a rare earth-transition metal, a chalcogen 
compound thin film formed by utilizing phase change of an 
amorphous phase and a crystal phase, or a heat-mode 
recording film is used. In an optical recording medium having the above-described 
structure, various undesirable effects may result 
with respect to the interface between the substrate and the 
dielectric layer based on the use of a certain material, 
such as a resin, for the substrate. For example, if the optical recording medium is 
constituted of a substrate made of an organic material, an 
intermediate layer formed of an inorganic dielectric 
material, or the like, and a recording layer, then a 
reduction in the adherence between the bonding surfaces of 
these materials or separation of these surfaces can easily 
be caused in a temperature and/or humidity cycling 
condition, since organic materials and inorganic materials 
in general differ greatly from each other in physical 
properties (e.g., heat conductivity and thermal expansion 
coefficient). This may be because a stress is caused in the 
bonding surfaces during cycles of expansion and contraction 
of the substrate and the dielectric layer. From a portion 
of the recording medium deteriorated for the above-described 
reason, a chemical change, such as oxidation or corrosion of 
the recording layer, or hydrolysis of the substrate, may  
 
occur, resulting in failure to record or reproduce a signal. 
Particularly under a high-humidity high-temperature 
condition, such a phenomenon can occur easily, and the long-time 
reliability of the medium is not satisfactorily high. To solve this problem, the following method may be 
used. As shown in Fig. 6, in an optical recording medium in
