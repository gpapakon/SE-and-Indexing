<ABSTRACT>
A method for synchronously operating two or more rotary head digital audio tape recorders without having to dedicate a separate timing track. The present invention synchronizes the machines in three steps. First, the slave unit reads the time code (111) value from the data stream and compares this time code (111) to the master's time code (111) examining the difference in time code (111) values and adjusting the transport speed so that the values are approximately equal. Next, the slave's capstan motors are slowed down (or sped up) so that the slave and master units are within one drum revolution of each other. Finally, the slave's microprocessor adjusts the speed of the entire system to skip individual samples until the master and slave units are synchronized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for synchronously operating a digital master
recorder and a digital slave recorder.In professional digital audio applications, it is often desirable to be
able to operate two or more rotary head digital audio recording machines
synchronously. During synchronous operation, each recorder is precisely
lined up on an exact sample per sample basis. Synchronous operation of
multiple rotary head digital audio recorders permit a user to increase the
number of available recording tracks by combining the multi-track capability
of several recorders. Instead of requiring a more expensive sixteen track
recorder, for instance, a user could synchronously operate two eight track
rotary head recorders.During synchronous operation, it is convenient to be able to operate
the digital audio recorders in a variety of different modes of operation, such
as playback, record, and high-speed scanning (both forward and backward).
During normal operation, the rotary head is capable of detecting all of the
information stored on the magnetic tape. However, in a high-speed scan, or
"shuttle" mode, the linear tape speed is increased while the rotational speed
of the rotary head is kept constant. Thus, not all information can be detected.It is desirable to provide synchronous operation of the rotary head
recorders during normal operation to within single sample accuracy. This
allows the master and slave recorders to operate with a precise timing
relationship to one another at normal operating speeds.In the prior art, when multitrack recorders are "ganged" together to
operate synchronously, one track of the master recorder is dedicated to
providing synchronizing information to the slave recorders. Track
dedication eliminates a potential recording track that could be used to record 
a digital audio information. Using the prior art, if two eight track digital
audio recorders are operated synchronously, one track is dedicated to
synchronizing information, leaving only fifteen digitai audio recording
tracks. Thus, to provide sixteen track capability in the prior art, three eight
track digital audio recorders have to be used. This is both inconvenient and
inefficient.In the publication "A Professional DAT System" by Takafumi Ueno et al., in
SMPTE Journal, July 1990, pp. 542-553, a time code recording method for a digital audio
tape is described. To synchronize a master recorder and a slave recorder a master time
code is supplied to the slave recorder. Then the slave recorder chases to the master time
code by

A method for synchronously operating a digital master re-corder

(a) transmitting a master data sample clock signal (401) of said
master recorder to said slave recorder;
(b) adjusting (701) a data sample clock rate (138) of said slave recorder
so that said data sample clock is phase locked to said

master data sample clock;
(c) transmitting a current master time code (402) from said master
recorder to said slave recorder to derive (709) an absolute sample
