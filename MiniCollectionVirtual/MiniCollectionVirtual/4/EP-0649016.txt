<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with an electrical 
testing process suitable, for example for determining 
surface characteristics of a coating on an electrically 
conductive surface. Anodised aluminium is a material used for many 
purposes. It is made by connecting aluminium as the anode 
in an electrolytic bath of ionised water with a nickel 
cathode. During electrolysis a film of aluminium oxide 
builds on the aluminium. The film generally contains a 
regular pattern of pores or pits having a hemispherical 
portion and a greater or lesser cylindrical wall. The 
material may be subjected to a colouring operation in which 
a colorant or reflectant is deposited in the pits. Subsequently 
the aluminium so treated is subjected to a treatment 
to produce a layer of crystalline monohydrate on the 
aluminium oxide film, which enters the pores and overcoats 
the film. The precise materials and procedures employed to 
produce the anodised aluminium govern the thickness and 
mutual adhesion of the layers to the aluminium and 
generally determines the surface characteristics of the 
product Anodised aluminium is frequently used in buildings, 
for example in the construction of windows and in surface 
cladding. It is one practice to bond or seal glass to 
aluminium by adhesive techniques. In some applications the 
extent to which the pores are filled, and thus the nature 
of the surface of the anodised aluminium, is of critical 
interest with regard to adhesion of adhesives and sealants 
thereto and the durability of adhesive bonds to the 
aluminium. Various techniques are available for preparing 
anodised aluminium to accept adhesives and sealants, but  
 
the most appropriate one to use is determined by the nature 
of the surface to be treated. Techniques are known for 
determining the characteristics of surfaces but we have 
found them unsuitable for simple and rapid determination of 
detailed information about surface characteristics for 
various reasons. Thus, determination of porosity of an 
anodised aluminium surface by measuring the darkness of the 
trace left by a drop of colouring matter laid on the 
surface is not appropriate for coloured aluminium; 
prolonged immersion of the anodised aluminium in a 
sulphuric acid bath, followed by determination of the 
weight loss of the aluminium, requires 20 hours immersion 
and in any event gives a poor guide because the degree of 
porosity of the surface is not directly proportional to the 
weight loss; the test method under ISO 2931 based on 
analogy between the
