<ABSTRACT>
The phase-locked loop includes means (3) for generating an internal signal (SIN) drawn from the output signal from the voltage-controlled oscillator (2), and a phase comparator (4) able to compare the phase of the internal signal (SIN) with that of an external signal received (SSY) and the output of which is looped back onto the voltage-controlled oscillator (2). It further comprises a device (6) for accelerating synchronisation of the internal and external signals, including processing means able to receive from the phase comparator (4) a predetermined indication representative of the non-coincidence of the internal and external signals, and to deliver, in response to this predetermined indication, control information in response to which the generation means (3) alter the phase of the internal signal in order to force the latter substantially into phase with the external signal (SSY).
