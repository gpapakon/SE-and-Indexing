<ABSTRACT>
A self contained hand held fetal detector comprises an 
ultrasonic receiver and transmitter (23). Selectively 

actuable ultrasonic receiving and transmitting circuits 
(25,21) are connected to the ultrasonic receiver and 

transmitter (23) with a controller (24) for actuating 
either the ultrasonic receiving circuit (25) or the 

ultrasonic transmitting circuit and a loudspeaker (29) 
connected to the ultrasonic receiving circuit (25) for 

generating an audio output signal. The detector comprises 
a single unit (13) and the controller (24) modifies at 

least one of the transmitted and received signals, to 
prevent interference in the received ultrasound.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fetal heart detector, in 
particular to a hand held detector. Conventional fetal heart detectors include hand held, 
audible detectors which are formed in two parts connected 
via cabling. The first part is an ultrasonic probe having 
two angled ultrasonic crystals, one for transmission and 
one for reception. An ultrasonic signal is continuously 
transmitted typically at a frequency of 2 MHz and this 
causes reflections from surfaces in the medium through 
which it passes. The receiving crystal continuously senses 
reflected signals. If an object, off which the signals are reflected, 
moves this causes a doppler shift in the frequency which is 
detected. This doppler shift is typically in the audio 
range when caused by movement of a fetal heart wall and the 
signal can be amplified and output directly through an 
audio loudspeaker in the second part. The main advantage 
of an audio output to a pocket monitor is that it enables 
the mother to hear the fetal heartbeat, thus reassuring the 
mother. Additionally in view of its focused ultrasonic 
beam it allows earlier detection of the fetal heart beat 
than a bedside monitor where a larger transducer having a 
divergent beam is used. A hand held detector may be used by a mid-wife in the 
home or in a hospital, or by consultants to give the heart 
rate of the fetus. The heart rate may be displayed 
directly on the monitor. It is desirable that the cost of manufacture of such 
detectors should be kept as low as possible and that they 
should be easy to use and to carry. Conventional hand held 
detectors rely on continuous wave transmissions of 
ultrasonic signals. A continuous wave system has no limit 
on the distance of travel of a wave before its reflected 
wave can be detected in the receiving crystal. This means 
that movement of the loudspeaker in the output section will 
be detected by the receiving crystal unless there is some  
 
form of separation between the transducer and the output 
section. Typically, this is achieved by housing the 
transducer in a probe and using a separate audio unit 
connected to the probe by means of a cable. Other proposed solutions to this problem include 
providing the probe with a transmitter to transmit 
information via telemetry to a completely separate audio 
unit such as described in EP-A-0367251, or using infrared 
transmission. An alternative is to use headphones rather 
than a loudspeaker but this does not overcome the 
disadvantages inherent in two piece units which require 
addition
