<ABSTRACT>
A method of measuring the inner diameter of a 
pipe, includes the steps of continuously transmitting 

electric waves in a predetermined frequency band from an 
antenna of a transmitter located inside of the pipe to be 

inspected, receiving the electric waves by an antenna of 
a receiver located inside the pipe, the antenna of the 

reciver being spaced apart from the antenna of the 
transmitter by a predetermined distance, detecting a 

frequency at a change point where an intensity of the 
received electric wave changes greatly, substituting the 

frequency at the change point into a formula: 

d=c/1.706f 
 
(where 
d
 is the inner diameter of the pipe, 
c
 is the 
velocity of light, and 
f
 is the frequency of the change 
point) which shows the relation between the inner 

diameter of the pipe and the frequency to obtain a 
minimum inner diameter of the pipe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
easily measuring the inner diameter of a pipe such as a
gas pipe buried underground within a short period of time.Known conventional methods of measuring the inner
diameter of a gas pipe buried underground and inspecting
whether a foreign substance such as earth and sand enters
into piping include a method of inserting an inspection
camera into the pipe to pick up the internal state of the
pipe and observe the resultant image, thereby determining
the internal state, or using an elastically deformable
probe and inserting the probe into the pipe to detect the
deformed state of the probe, thereby measuring the inner
diameter of the pipe (Japanese Patent Publication No. SHO
57-34482) and a method of radiating a laser beam on the
inner wall surface of a pipe and receiving a beam
reflected by the inner wall surface to measure the inner
diameter (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. HEI 3-261806).In the above methods, it is difficult to insert
the camera, the probe, and an apparatus for radiating the
laser beam and receiving the reflected beam in the pipe 
so as to conform to the complicated bent shape of the
pipe, and the internal state of the pipe cannot be
properly inspected. In addition, an insertion hole is
required to insert the above inspecting means. To inspect
the buried pipe, cumbersome, time-consuming construction
works such as digging must be involved. In addition, the
inspection distance per cycle is limited to the length of
a cable or the like connected to the camera or probe.
When inspection is required for a long distance, the
number of inspection cycles are undesirably increased,
requiring much labor and high cost.The present invention has been made in consideration
of the above situation, and has as its object to
provide a method of measuring the inner diameter of a
pipe, which is capable of easily, properly measuring the
inner diameter of the pipe such as a gas pipe buried
underground within a short period of time.In order to achieve the above object, according to
the main aspect of the present invention, there is
provided a method of measuring an inner diameter of a
pipe, including the steps of continuously transmitting
electric waves in a predetermined frequency band from an
antenna of a transmitter located inside of the pipe to be
inspected, receiving the electric waves by an antenna of 
a receiver located inside the pipe, the antenna of the
receiver being spaced apart from the antenna of the
transmitter by a predetermined distance, detecting a

electric waves in a predetermined frequency band from an
antenna of a transmitter located inside of the pipe to be

inspected, receiving the electric waves by an antenna of
a receiver located inside the pipe, said antenna of the

receiver being spaced apart from said antenna of the
transmitter by a predetermined distance, detecting a

comprising the step of comparing the frequency of the

change point with predetermined frequency ranges 
determined for gas pipes having different diameters,

thereby estimating the inner diameter of the pipe.
A method according to claim 1, further
comprising the step of shifting the predetermined

frequency band of the electric waves transmitted from the
transmitter to a higher-frequency band side.
