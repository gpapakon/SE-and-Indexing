<ABSTRACT>
Method for moulding a ski in a single stage, consisting:   . in depositing at least one layer of inner reinforcement (13, 14) in the bottom of a mould; . in positioning an upper reinforcement layer (22) composed of mechanisation elements over this lower assembly (10); . in placing a protective and decorative layer (21) over this upper reinforcement layer (22);   . in closing the cover (lid) of the mould; . in injecting a fluid intended to expand the various elements against the walls, between the lower assembly (10) and upper assembly (22); characterised in that at least one additional element (30) intended to vary the relative position of the mechanisation elements of the said reinforcement layer (22) with respect to the faces of the ski is positioned at the level of the upper reinforcement layer (22).

A process for the manufacture of a shaped ski in a single step, securing
simultaneously forming and molding, which consists:


in laying down into the bottom part of a mold in two parts, respectively a
bottom (1) and a cover (2), a lower assembly (10) comprising a sliding

surface (11), edges (12,12') and at least one lower reinforcing element
(13,14);
in positioning on this lower assembly (10) a upper reinforcing layer (22)
composed of mechanization fibrous layers;
in placing on this upper fibrous reinforcing layer (22) a protective and
decorative layer (21), intended to form the three other faces of the ski,

namely at least part of the sides and the top, while at the same time
forming a cavity (50);
in closing the cover (2) onto the bottom (1) of the mold;
in injecting into the cavity (50) formed between the lower assembly (10)
and the upper reinforcing layer (22), a fluid intended to expand the

various elements against the walls (3,4,5) of the mold;
and finally, in cooling and opening the mold in order to remove the ski
obtained;
characterized
 in that, in the region located between the protective and decorative
layer (21) and one at least of the fibrous mechanization layers constituting the

upper reinforcing layer (22), at least one additional element (30) is positioned, the
main face of which intended to be directed towards the lower assembly (10) is

rounded and convex, the said additional element (30) being intended, after fluid
expansion, to modify the relative position of the upper reinforcing layer (22) with

respect to the faces of the ski, and to prevent a rough deformation of the fibrous
layers of the upper reinforcing layer (22).
A process according to claim 1, wherein the additional element (30) is
laid down between the fibrous mechanization layers of the upper reinforcing layer

(22). 
A process according to claim 1, wherein the additional element (30) is
laid down onto the mechanization layers of the fibrous upper reinforcing layer (22).
A process according to claim 1, wherein the protective and decorative
layer is a single thermoplastic shell (21) fitting exactly with the shape of the ski.
A process according to claim 1, wherein the top face of the shell of the
ski exhibits a relief (40) defining a cavity (6) on the inner face of the protective

layer (21), said additional element (30) filling up this cavity (6) by modifying the
relative position of the upper fibrous reinforcing element (22) with respect to the

top of the ski, without breakage of the fibers of this element (22).
A process according to claim 5, wherein the cavity (6) is provided on the
inner wall (3) of the cover (2) intended to define the top of the ski, just downstream

of the position forming the tip of the ski and just upstream the tail, to wit in the
portion where the vibration-damping system is generally positioned.
A process according to claim 1, wherein the additional element (30) is
made of a material selected from the group of materials commonly used in the

manufacture of skis, comprising plastic materials, wood, metal, composite
materials and visco-elastic materials.
