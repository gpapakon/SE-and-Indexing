<CLAIMS>
A method for the catalytic treatment of aqueous 
liquids containing germs, in which the aqueous liquid 

is passed through a catalyst, characterised in that 
particulate catalysts having a particle size of 0.1 to 

10 mm are used and the catalytic treatment is effected 
in the fluidised bed in the absence of hydrazine, 

hydrazide or hydrazone, with the liquid to be treated 
flowing through a reactor. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that spherical catalysts having a diameter of 0.3 to 

0.8 mm are used. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the catalytic treatment is the reductive 

removal of oxygen. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the catalytic treatment is the reductive 

removal of nitrite and/or nitrate with selective 
nitrogen formation.
