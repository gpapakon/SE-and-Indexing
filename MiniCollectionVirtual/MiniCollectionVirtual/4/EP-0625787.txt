An electric double layer capacitor having a rectangular 
cross-section for an excellent volumetric efficiency and a low 

internal resistance is disclosed. The capacitor comprises a 
plurality of sheet-like current collectors (11, 12) in one 

polarity and in the other polarity; the surfaces of the both 

collectors are formed into polarizable electrodes (13, 14) 
composed mainly of activated carbon with a binder; a plurality 

of separators (15, 16) interposed between the current 
collectors of the one polarity and those of the other polarity 

being provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electric double
layer capacitors and, in particular, to such capacitors
that employ activated carbon in their polarizable
electrodes.The electric double layer capacitor is a
capacitor that utilizes a phenomenon wherein electric energy
is stored, in the form of electric charge, in an electric
double layer formed at an interface between the
polarizable electrode and an electrolyte.The electric double layer capacitor has a large
capacitance for its size and has a wide application as a
back-up power source for electronic devices such as
microprocessors, electronic memory devices, electronic
timers and the like.Representative arrangements of the conventional
electric double layer capacitors are those of cylindrical
type as shown in, for instance, United States Patent
No. 5,150,283. In a typical arrangement, a sheet-like
current collector of one polarity, whose surfaces are 
formed into the polarizable electrode composed of
activated carbon and a binder, and another sheet-like current
collector of the other polarity are wound into a roll by
interlaying a separator therebetween. The wound roll is
then impregnated with the electrolyte solution, and
thereafter housed in a cylindrical container whose open
end is sealed with a rubber packing. Lead wires connected
to the respective current collectors are drawn out of the
container by piercing through the rubber packing.The above-mentioned cylindrical electric double
layer capacitor has a high capacitance density, i.e., a
large capacitance for its unit volume. However,
the cylindrical capacitor sometimes has an insufficient
volumetric efficiency when it is installed in certain
electronic appliances. When arranging a plurality
of the cylindrical capacitors in serial or parallel
connection for securing a large capacitance or a high
working voltage a plurality of dead spaces
are inevitably created between the laterally aligned
capacitors, thereby resulting a large total dead space and
considerably deteriorating volumetric efficiency.In addition, in the above-discussed conventional
electric double layer capacitor, the lead wires are
electrically connected to only small spots of the current
collectors in a long belt shape. Therefore, the
conventional electric double layer capacitor has a 
disadvantage that an impedance at the lead wire part is
large. Usually, the electric double layer capacitor
comprising activated carbon is employed where
a large current such as from 100 A to 1,000 A is required
for a period of time lasting from several
