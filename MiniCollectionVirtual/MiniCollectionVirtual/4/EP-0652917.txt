<ABSTRACT>
An improved abrasive grain comprising the sintered product of a porous non-sintered particle having a coating of inorganic material thereon is provided. A preferred method of making such abrasive grains comprises coating the porous base particles with inorganic particles. The preferred step of coating comprises a step of mixing the base particles with a suspension containing the inorganic particles in a carrier fluid. The porous base particles having the coating of inorganic particles thereon are sintered, to generate the ceramic abrasive grain product. The abrasive grains may be incorporated, to advantage, in a variety of abrasive products including, for example, bonded abrasives, nonwoven abrasive products and coated abrasive products.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improved abrasive grains, in
particular, improved alpha alumina-based ceramic abrasive grains. The invention
further concerns methods of preparing improved abrasive grains and abrasive
products which contain improved grains.The abrasives industry generally concerns abrasive products
comprising a binder and a plurality of abrasive grains. During abrasion, the
abrasive grains are brought into contact with a work surface generally at a
considerable pressure and with development of a substantial amount of heat. It is
important for such operations that the abrasive products appropriately retain the
abrasive grains. That is, generally, premature release of the abrasive grains from
the abrasive products is to be avoided.A variety of abrasive products are known, including coated abrasive
products, bonded abrasives and nonwoven abrasives. In general, coated abrasive
products comprise a substrate or backing having a layer of abrasive grains secured
thereto by means of adhesive or binder. A bonded abrasive generally comprises
a solid mass formed from abrasive grains and binder, for example a grinding
wheel or a cutoff wheel. Nonwoven abrasives generally comprise abrasive grains
bound onto and in a nonwoven fibrous substrate by means of binder or adhesive.Generally, premature release of abrasive grains has been a problem
with respect to all of the various types of abrasive products even those from which
a controlled rate of release is desired. The problem is particularly significant
when the abrasive product is used for high stock removal applications. During
such uses, the abrasive product must be able to withstand high pressures and
rotative speeds, while still providing a good, sufficient abrasive cut. For example,
a coated abrasive disk may traverse 12,000 revolutions per minute (rpm) and be
subjected to an interface pressure as high as 15 kg/cm2. Such severe conditions 
may be preferred for certain applications as they result in increased cut rates.
However, they severely tax the integrity of the bond between the abrasive grain
and the binder (adhesive) system. If the bond at this interface fails, the abrasive
grains are rejected (or shelled) from the abrasive product.In the coated abrasive industry, the term "shelling" is sometimes
utilized to refer to the phenomenon of abrasive grain release from binder, in use.
Generally, the term "shelling" is applied whether the product involved is a coated
abrasive or some other form of abrasive product, such as a bonded abrasive or
nonwov
