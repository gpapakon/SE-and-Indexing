<ABSTRACT>
An ignition system is provided that marries a free-running discharge circuit with a fast-charging, high voltage converter without resulting in an excessive rate of discharge. To this end, the free-running discharge circuit employs a passive switch embodied either as a spark-gap device or a passive network of semiconductor elements. A feedback circuit detects discharge events at the discharge circuit and, in response thereto, selectively enables and disables the fast-charging converter. A spark rate clock is integrated into the feedback circuit for the purpose of setting the average discharge rate to a predetermined value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to ignition systems for 
turbine engines and more particularly relates to an ignition 
system according to the preamble of claim 1 and to the method 
according to claim 8, respectively. An ignition system and a corresponding method of this type 
are known from US-A-4,983,886 already disclosing an ignition 
system being characterized by short-circuiting means 
including at least one semi-conductor switching device 
controlled by comparator means comparing the voltage at the 
terminals of the storage capacitor with a reference voltage. Further, US-A-3,569,727 discloses a control means for 
automatically disabling an electrical pulse or spark 
generating apparatus after a predetermined operating 
interval. To this end, the known system includes a circuit 
comprising an induction transformer, a bridge rectifier, a 
spark-gap switch and a solenoid including two coils.  
 Generally, conventional spark ignition systems for aircraft 
turbines use a spark-gap device to control the flow of 
energy to igniter plugs by way of charge/discharge 
cycles, which produce sparks at one or more of the plugs 
for igniting fuel in the combustor of the turbine engine. 
In such systems, a high voltage power source charges a 
storage capacitor at a predetermined rate. As the 
capacitor is charged, the DC voltage at the terminal of 
the capacitor rises, but the spark-gap device keeps it 
disconnected from the igniter plug by acting like an open 
switch. The spark-gap device has a preset breakdown 
voltage. When the voltage of the capacitor rises to that 
preset value, the spark-gap device fires (i.e., becomes a 
closed switch) and discharges the capacitor through an 
output circuit to the one or more igniter plugs. The discharge event is relatively instantaneous 
compared to the time taken to charge the storage 
capacitor. When the discharge event occurs, the storage 
capacitor begins a new cycle by recharging at the same 
predetermined rate as in the previous cycle. This rate 
is determined by the design of the high-voltage power 
source. The charge/discharge cycle is thus repetitive 
and repeats at a rate which is inversely related to the 
time required to charge the storage capacitor to the 
breakdown voltage of the spark-gap device. This mode of 
operation is continuous and free-running - i.e., it is 
not controlled by a clock or timing device.  
 Spark-gap devices are very good at switching the 
high voltage and current of an ignition system from a 
storage device to an output igniter plug.
