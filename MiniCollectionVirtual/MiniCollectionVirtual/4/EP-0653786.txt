<ABSTRACT>
A manufacturing method for the DMOS in a BiCMOS semiconductor apparatus is comprised of 
steps of forming an ion-implanted layer (8) in a surface of a P-type well (5); forming a gate 

electrode (10); self-aligning a P-type base region (21) by employing the P-type base formation 
process of the bipolar transistor of the BiCMOS semiconductor apparatus and by using the gate 

electrode (10) as a mask; forming a side wall (25) on a side face of the gate electrode (10) by 
employing the process for forming the LDD structure of the CMOS of the BiCMOS 

semiconductor apparatus ; and self-aligning an N⁺-type source region (26
NS
) by employing the 
process for forming the N⁺-type source and the drain of the CMOS and by using the side wall 

(25) as a mask. The effective channel length becomes longer by the side wall length and the 
rate of heavily doped channel portion to the total channel length becomes high. The present 

manufacturing method effectively suppresses surface punching through by the high rate of the 
heavily doped channel portion and facilitates increasing withstand voltage and current capacity 

of the DMOS portion even when the total acceptor amount in the ion-implanted layer is 
insufficient.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a low withstand voltage BiCMOS processing technique for 
mounting a power DMOS transistor, a bipolar transistor and a CMOS transistor on a common 
chip (the same base plate) and, more specifically, the present invention relates to a 
manufacturing method for the power DMOS transistor. Figure 18 shows a typical CMOS portion (a complementary insulated-gate field effect 
transistor) of a BiCMOS semiconductor apparatus which has a double-well (twin-tub) structure. 
In Fig. 18, the CMOS portion is comprised of an N⁺-type buried layer 2 formed on a P-type 
substrate 1; N-type epitaxial layer 3 grown over the buried layer 2; an isolated element island 
isolated by a P⁺-type isolation layer 4 which reaches the P-type substrate 1; and double wells 
(a P-type well 5 and an N-type well 6) formed in the isolated element island by ion-implantation 
and subsequent diffusion. After the double-well formation, a CMOS transistor is formed in the 
CMOS portion through the following steps. An active region is covered, for example, by a 
nitride film, and then element-isolating insulative film (local oxidation film : LOCOS) 7 is formed 
on the P⁺-type isolation layer 4 and the non-well portions between the P- and N-type wells 5 
and 6 by selectively oxidizing the nitride film 7. An ion-implanted layer 8 is formed by 
implanting acceptor type (P-type) impurities such as BF₂ shallowly from the major faces of the 
wells 5 and 6. Poly-silicon gate electrodes 10 are formed on the gate insulation film 9 
deposited on the wells 5 and 6. An N⁺-type source region 11NS and an N⁺-type drain region 
11ND are formed by self-alignment using the gate electrode 10 on the P-type well 5 as a mask. 
Through this step, an N⁺-type well-contact region 11NCON is formed simultaneously on the 
source side in the N-type well 6. Then, a P⁺-type source region 11PS and a P⁺-type drain 
region 11PD are formed by the self-alignment technique using the gate electrode 10 on the N-type 
well 6 as a mask. Through this step, a P⁺-type well-contact region 11PCON is formed 
simultaneously on the source side in the P-type well 5. Then, inter-layer insulation film 12 is 
formed, and, finally, source electrodes 13NS, 13PS and drain electrodes 13ND, 13PD, which fill 
contact holes punched through the insulation film 12 are deposited. Figures 19 and 20 show structures of a high-withstand voltage DMOS portion (double-diffusion 
type insulated gate field effect transistor) as a power MOS portion of the BiCMOS 
semiconductor apparatus.
