<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing a superplastic aluminum alloy capable of being 

used for plastic working such as extrusion, forging and 
rolling. An object of the present invention is to provide 

an ingot-made high speed superplastic aluminum alloy in 
which superplasticity is developed at a strain rate higher 

than that of conventional static recrystallization type 
superplastic aluminum alloys, and a process for producing 

the same. The superplastic aluminum alloy of the invention 
has structure which is obtained by adding to a basic alloy 

containing from at least 4.0 to 15% by weight of Mg and 
from 0.1 to 1.0% by weight of one or more elements selected 

from the group consisting of Mm, Zr, V, W, Ti, Ni, Nb, Ca, 
Co, Mo and Ta, and further selective elements of Sc, Cu, 

Li, Sn, In and Cd, which contains from 0.1 to 4.0% by 
volume fraction of spheroidal precipitates of intermetallic 

compounds having a particle size from 10 to 200 nm, and 
which has a mean grain size from 0.1 to 10 µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a superplastic
material, and particularly to an ingot-made high-speed
superplastic aluminum alloy capable of being subjected to
plastic working such as extruding, forging and rolling, and
a process for producing the same.Aluminum alloys are known to have
superplasticity, and they include Al-Cu alloys, Al-Mg-Zn-Cu
alloys, Al-Li alloys, Al-Mg-Si alloys, Al-Ca alloys, Al-Ni
alloys, and the like (e.g., refer to "Basis and Industrial
Technology for Aluminum Materials," p387, Table 1, Japan
Light Metal Association (1985)).Ordinary superplastic materials are
superplastically deformed as a common practice by
statically recrystallizing them prior to deformation to
achieve grain refining, and applying a load at a high
temperature at a low strain rate to effect boundary
sliding. There is also known a dynamic recrystallization
type aluminum alloy, which is dynamically recrystallized to
form fine and uniform grain structure in the initial stage
of high temperature deformation, and which is subsequently
superplastically deformed (e.g., refer to K. Higashi,
"Superplasticity in commercial aluminum alloys, "Journal of
Japan institute of Light Metals, 39, No. 11, 751-764
(1989)).Moreover, KOKAI (Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication) No. 50-155410 discloses a process, for
producing a product, comprising non-superplastically
deforming a material and superplastically deforming the
deformed material while recrystallized grains having fine
structure are being successively formed. Moreover, KOKAI 
(Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication) No. 60-5865
discloses a process, for superplastically deforming a
material, comprising deforming the material at a first
strain rate to induce dynamic recrystallization, and then
deforming at a second strain rate. Furthermore, KOKAI
(Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication) No. 60-238460
discloses a process for producing a fine grain superplastic
material having a superplastic elongation as a process for
producing a superplastic Al-Mg alloy, wherein warm working,
heating and cooling, and cold working are carried out in
combination. Still furthermore, KOKAI (Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publication) No. 4-504141 discloses a process for
producing an intermediately elongated product which can be
superplastically deformed only after non-superplastically
deforming for the purpose of dynamic recrystallization.Representative of the prior art is Hales and Nc Nelley, 'Microstructural evolution by continuous recrystallization in a superplastic Al-Mg alloy', Acta. Metall.,
