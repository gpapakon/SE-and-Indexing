material of increased resistance to moisture, and a method of producing such a 

composite, which comprises a mixture of the following components: a matrix material 
comprised of at least one organic thermoplastic or thermosetting polymer; at least one 

phosphate glass; and, an amount of a phosphoric acid ester stabilizer component 
sufficient to improve the moisture resistance of the composite. Preferably, the 

mixture is comprised of three basic components in the approximate indicated weight 
proportions: 1-99.5% of the matrix material; 0.1-95% of the phosphate glass; and, 1

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a more durable glass/polymer composite and a 
method for increasing the durability of the composite. In general, it involves the 
addition of a third component phosphoric acid ester to the glass/polymer composite, 
resulting in a glass/polymer composite with decreased glass agglomeration and 
increased glass/polymer interaction. Composite bodies containing organic polymers are well known to the art. 
Generally speaking, polymer composites, which may be regarded as multi-phase 
materials of two or more components in which the polymer comprises the continuous 
phase, can be considered as containing fillers or reinforcing agents, the function of 
the two frequently overlapping. Thus, polymer composites have conventionally 
consisted of a base polymer containing additives such as plasticisers, colorants, flame 
retardants, reinforcing fibers and/or whiskers, fillers and stabilizers against heat 
and/or sunlight.  Such filled plastic products are commercially available and customarily consist 
of organic polymers enveloping discrete organic or inorganic particles, flakes, fibers, 
whiskers, or other configurations of materials. These filler materials may be 
incorporated principally for the purpose of reducing the overall cost of the product 
without seriously undermining the properties of the polymer. For example, clays and 
talc have been added as inexpensive fillers. On the other hand, the filler materials 
may have been included to impart some improvement to a particular physical property 
exhibited by the polymer. For example, ceramic or glass fibers have been entrained 
in polymer bodies to provide reinforcement thereto. The higher strength 
demonstrated by those products is primarily dependent upon strong bonding between 
the inorganic fibers and the organic polymers. Within the past two decades some research has been conducted to investigate 
the possibility of forming composite bodies consisting of inorganic glasses exhibiting 
low transition temperatures and organic polymers, which bodies would, desirably, 
demonstrate the combined properties of glass ad plastic. Illustrative of that research 
is U.S. Pat. No. 3,732,181 (Ray et al.). As is observed there, the decomposition 
temperatures of known thermoplastic and thermosetting resins are so low that glass 
compositions where SiO₂ is the principal network or glass former cannot be 
employed. Hence, to be operable the Tg of the glass will be below 450°C and 
preferably below 350°C. (As customarily defined, the Tg of a
