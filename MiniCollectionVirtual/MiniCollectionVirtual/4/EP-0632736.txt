<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to breathing apparatus for respiratory
protection of civilians and combatants.Early types of breathing apparatus include a flexible hood with a
visor for aviators (F741127) and a rigid helmet with a glass
window for divers (GB426962), both with a remote breathable gas
supply. More recently, various types of portable breathing
apparatus have been described. A simple transparent bag with a
neck seal and a filter is known (GB 2129670A) but the design is
defective due to a large effective dead space. The deficiency
may be overcome by incorporation of an oro nasal mask (ONM) or
other conveyance means in the breathing circuit. It is well
known in the art to have such an ONM supported by a strap harness
and to have inlet and outlet valves, both for a breathable gas
system (WO82/02492) and for a filter system (EPO275934A2).
However, problems may arise from a poorly fitting ONM which
allows outward leakage of exhaled gas with effective increase of
dead space. Also, moisture in the exhaled gas condenses on a
visor, if fitted, to cause misting and impairment of vision. In
the present invention a close fitting elasticated fabric helmet
is used as a harness to exert even traction all round the rim of
the ONM and pulls it onto the face to secure a good fit. The
neck seal of the hood, which forms an integral part of the
breathing apparatus, may be sealed by a draw string (W082/02492,
EPO275934A2) but much inward leakage of the noxious external
atmosphere takes place past this type of seal. An elasticated
septal neck seal (GB2129670A) allows less leakage but the leakage
may be further reduced by having a positive pressure inside the
hood. A positive pressure may be achieved by passing exhaled gas
to the hood space (GB2211098A, GB2164570A) but such designs are
defective because the moisture in the exhaled gas impairs vision.
In EP-A-0 301 732 exhaled gas is passed into a chamber between a hood and an inner
flexible membrane attached to the hood.
Positive pressure breathing apparatus is well known (GB 1587121,
GB 2074456A). In the present invention, unlike GB 1587121, a
reservoir is described between two hoods and it differs from GB
2074456A in that complex pressure reducing valves are not
required. In the present invention a positive pressure is
achieved by passing dry gas under pressure and at constant flow
directly into the hood space reservoir. There is virtually no
inward leakage past the neck seal if the hood space remains at
positive pressure and this is ensured if the volume of the
reservoir

<CLAIMS>
Breathing apparatus to provide respiratory protection having
an outer hood (1), an inner hood (7), a reservoir (8) at positive pressure, a

breathable gas source (11) and a mask (4) with one way valves (9, 10)
in a circuit system such that:


A) the outer hood is:

(i) made from impermeable gas proof material,
(ii) transparent at least in part,
(iii) completed by an elastic neck seal;
B) the inner hood is:

(i) close fitting to the head,
(ii) made from elasticated material,
(iii) attached to the outer hood,
(iv) attached to the rim of the mask to support it
and pull the rim onto the face;
C) the reservoir is:

(i) positioned in the space between the inner and outer hoods,
(ii) constructed with a volume which is in excess of the
breathing volume of the user;
D) the breathable gas source discharges dry breathable gas
directly into the reservoir to raise it to positive pressure and
E) the mask covers the mouth of the user and
has:


(i) a one way inlet valve (9) which allows breathable gas to
pass from the reservoir to the cavity of the mask,

and
(ii) a one way outlet valve (10) which allows breathable gas to
pass from the mask cavity to the ambient

atmosphere.
Breathing apparatus according to claim 1 in which the
breathable gas source is compressed air.
Breathing apparatus according to claim 1 or 2 in which the
opening pressures of the inlet and outlet valves are set to

maintain a positive pressure in the reservoir.
Breathing apparatus according to any preceding claim in which
a demand valve is provided.
