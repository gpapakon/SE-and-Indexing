<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus serves for introducing carbon dioxide in solid form into vessels such as cans or into liquid or solid substances which are charged in vessels. For this purpose a carbon dioxide storage vessel (1) is connected to a metering unit (2), this metering unit containing a pressure-reduction nozzle (3) which is mounted inside a cylinder (4) which exhibits, on its peripheral and/or end surface, outlet orifices for carbon dioxide gas (5,6) and carbon dioxide snow (7). The apparatus according to the invention utilises the unpressurised introduction of carbon dioxide in solid form (dry snow or dry ice) into a liquid or solid substance, the gas formed on depressurisation being removed by suction and the carbon dioxide snow being able to be compacted before it passes into the vessel. Higher amounts of carbon dioxide than hitherto can be introduced into the substance in the vessel with precise metering and dissolve well there in the substance without the aid of mechanical means. This is especially expedient for introducing carbon dioxide as a propellant.

Process for the unpressurized introduction of a
precisely measurable amount of carbon dioxide in solid

form into containers such as cans or into liquid or solid
substances which are packed in containers, characterized

in that liquid carbon dioxide is passed into a metering
unit which includes an expansion nozzle, and the liquid

carbon dioxide is expanded in the expansion nozzle which
is mounted within a cylinder, in which case resulting

gaseous carbon dioxide is removed by suction through
outlet orifices situated in the vicinity of the expansion

nozzle in the curved surface of the cylinder, and the
resulting carbon dioxide in solid form is introduced into

the container or the substance through outlet orifices
provided further downstream in the cylinder, the amount

of the solid carbon dioxide being determined by weighing
or via the injection period.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that first the solid carbon dioxide and then the liquid

or solid substance are packed in the container.
Process according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the resulting carbon dioxide in

solid form is compressed by a baffle plate mounted at the
expansion nozzle.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the resulting carbon dioxide in

solid form is compressed by one or more baffle plates

mounted within the cylinder surrounding the expansion
nozzle and/or baffle plates mounted at the downstream end

of the cylinder. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the expansion nozzle is opened

pneumatically.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the metering unit is pneumatically

moved in the direction towards the container for the
liquid or solid substance.
