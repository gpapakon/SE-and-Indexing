<ABSTRACT>
Disposable garments of the training pants variety include a cuff 
(80) which is rolled inwardly from the plane of each leg opening (56). 

The rolled cuff feature (80) is obtained during production by 
stretching a unitary elastic sheet (40) across the machine web (34) in 

a direction lateral to the direction of manufacture, and then cutting 
leg openings (56) through the elastic sheet (40) and an adjacent outer 

web (34). The machinery for manufacturing the garments includes 
various features which facilitate the manufacture of this garment, 

including a reciprocating cutting knife and an associated accumulating 
conveyor for providing a reciprocal motion into the reciprocal knife. 

The manufacturing apparatus also includes features for maintaining core 
pads in the desired alignment, and various other features.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to disposable garments and 
methods and apparatus for making such garments. The prior art teaches a wide variety of disposable diaper 
configurations, in which the finished diaper is a flat panel 
having adhesive tabs or the like, permitting the joinder of 
one end of the panel to the other, to fit the diaper panel 
from the infant's back, under the crotch and to the front of 
the waist. Examples of such arrangements are shown in the 
following U.S. Patents: 3,081,772 to Brooks et al; 3,417,751 
to Murdoch; 4,892,528 to Suzuki et al; and 5,064,489 to 
Ujimoto et al. There have also been developed in the prior art a 
variation of finished disposable training pants for infants, 
in which the finished product has opposing side seams joining 
the front and back panels of the garment assembly. Examples 
of these arrangements are shown in the following U.S. Patents: 
4,743,239 to Cole; 4,743,241 to Igaue et al; 4,646,362 to 
Heran et al; 4,938,757 to Van Gompel et al; and 5,055,103 to 
Nomura et al; and 5,064,421 to Tracy.  The aforementioned U.S. Patent 4,743,241 to Igaue et al 
discloses an elastic sheet adhered across the panel adjacent 
to the opposing leg openings, which serves as a liquid barrier 
for body fluids leaking from the center absorbent pad. A 
similar arrangement is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,417,751 to 
Murdoch. The present invention is directed to disposable garments, 
particularly of the training pants variety, which include a 
rolled cuff inwardly from the plane of each leg opening, at 
least about the lower portion of the leg opening. Further, 
the present invention is directed to methods and apparatus for 
achieving this rolled cuff feature in a low cost and easy 
manner. The present invention also has the objective of 
providing methods and apparatus for achieving improvements and 
efficiencies in the manufacture of disposable garments of all 
types, including both disposable diapers, training pants, and 
incontinent garments for those who are elderly or infirmed. In one form, a disposable garment in accordance with the 
present invention includes a panel of a material at least a 
portion of which is liquid impervious, the panel defining leg 
openings. The garment is provided with elastic means 
extending continuously about the peripheral edge of each leg 
opening with the elastic means including a sheet of an elastic  
 
material stretched along an inside surface of the panel and 
about a substantial portion of the periphery of the 
corresponding leg
