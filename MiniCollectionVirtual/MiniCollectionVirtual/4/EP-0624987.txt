<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a communication system between 
patient surveillance units. The selection of a 

communication between monitors is at the same adapted to 
establish a vocal link between monitors (1, 6). A 

microphone (4) and a loudspeaker (5) are located in the 
vicinity of or in contact with user interface equipment (2, 

3; 7, 8) and the vocal message travels in the same closed-circuit 
network (11) as the rest of monitored information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a communication system 
between patient surveillance units, comprising at least 
two surveillance monitors, each monitor having its own 
information processing electronics, including its 
operating and control devices which together provide user 
interface equipment, electrodes or transducers to be 
attached to a patient and linked with the information 
processing electronics of at least one monitor, as well as 
a closed-circuit network for establishing a data 
transmission link between the monitors. In surgical or intensive care environment, it is often 
necessary to visually display the information monitored by 
a patient surveillance unit on another surveillance unit. 
This is particularly necessary in teaching hospitals, 
wherein a more experienced physician (often an 
anesthesiologist) is responsible not only for his or her 
own patient but also for a patient of a younger, 
specializing physician. Another necessity is the post-surveillance 
of patient already transferred to a recovery 
room and the consulting of nursing staff as the physician 
in charge is already in the process of anesthetizing the 
next patient in the operating theatre. There are several surveillance units on the market 
facilitating the visualization of graphic, e.g. ECG, 
numeric information and trends through a closed-circuit 
network. In problem situations, a physician in charge must 
either resort to the use of telephone for consulting 
advice or go there personally. In each case, this 
represents a significant break in the surveillance of his 
or her own patient.  In view of eliminating the above drawback or problem, a 
system of the invention is characterized in that the 
selection of a communication between the monitors is at 
the same time adapted to establish a vocal communication 
between the monitors. Thus, when operating a surveillance 
unit to select the (distant) patient whose information is 
to be inspected, the physician in charge establishes at 
the same time a vocal communication with a monitor serving 
as the source of information. The vocal communication can 
be established by means of the same closed-circuit network 
used for the transmission of other information. It is 
preferred that both a microphone and a loudspeaker be 
located in the immediate vicinity of a display monitor. An advantage of the invention is the speed of selection 
and the fact that a physician in charge need not turn his 
or her eyes away from a monitor screen showing the 
information for both his or her

<CLAIMS>
A communication system between patient surveillance 
units, comprising at least two surveillance monitors (1, 

6), information processing electronics (2, 7) associated 
with a monitor, operating and control equipment (3, 8) 

which, together with the information processing 
electronics, provides user interface equipment, electrodes 

or transducers (12, 13) to be attached to a patient and 
included in the information processing electronics (2) of 

at least one monitor (1), as well as a closed-circuit 
network (11) for establishing a data transmission link 

between the monitors (1, 6), characterized in 
that the selection of a communication between the monitors 

(1, 6) is adapted at the same time to establish a vocal 
communication between the monitors. 
A system as set forth in claim 1, characterized 
in that a microphone (4) or a loudspeaker (5) are 

located in the vicinity of or in contact with the user 
interface equipment (2, 3; 7, 8). 
A system as set forth in claim 1, characterized 
in that the vocal message travels in the same 

closed-circuit network (11) along with the rest of 
monitored information.
