<DESCRIPTION>
 HEMOSTATIC COMPOSITION FOR LOCAL HEMOSTASISFIELD OF INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a method for arresting local bleedings by topical use of FVIIa and a hemostatic composition containing FVIIa.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONWhen blood vessels are injured by physical traumas including surgical interventions bleeding will occur. If bleedings are left alone they will eventually be arrested by a normally occurring physiological process characterized by a chain of events involving the combined activity of vascular, platelet, and plasma factors, leading to the formation of a blood clot. This process is referred to as physiological hemostasis (blood coagulation), which is described in details below. In the case of a minor superficial bleeding this physiological hemostasis is adequate for the arrest.There are two separate systems which can promote blood coagulation. These systems are referred to as the intrinsic and the extrinsic coagulation pathways.In the intrinsic pathway, only blood clotting factors present in plasma are utilized. An intermediate event in the intrinsic pathway is the activation of Factor IX to Factor IXa, a reaction catalyzed by Factor Xla and calcium ions. Factor IXa then participates in the activation of Factor X to Factor Xa in the presence of Factor Villa, phospholipid and calcium ions.The extrinsic pathway involves plasma factors as well as components present in tissue extracts. Factor VII, a proenzyme present in plasma, participates also in the 

 extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation by converting (upon its activation to Vila) Factor X to Xa in the presence of tissue factor and calcium ions.Factor Xa in turn then converts prothrombin to thrombin in the presence of Factor Va, calcium ions and phospholipid. Finally, thrombin converts the plasma fibrinogen into fibrin, which in the presence of Factor XHIa and calcium ions is cross-linked and thus forming the blood clotBlood factors such as Factor VIII:C (see US Patents 4,831 ,119; 4,868,112; 4,886,876; 4,657,894; Re. 32,011 and 4,649,132) and Factor Vila (see US Patents 4,784,950; 4,382,083; 4,479,938 and 4,357,321) purified from natural sources or made via recombinant techniques have been used for treating patients, such as hemophiliacs, having blood-clotting deficiencies or inhibitors to blood-clotting factors. These blood-clotting factors have been delivered to the patient needing treatment as an aqueous solution by infusion or bolus injection depending on the blood factor to be delivered and the condition of the patient.
