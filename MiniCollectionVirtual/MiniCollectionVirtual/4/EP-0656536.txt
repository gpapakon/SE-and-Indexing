<ABSTRACT>
Light having a predetermined wavelength and 
various incident angle components is incident on a 

surface of a scattering medium and light diffused during 
propagation in the scattering medium is detected 

outside. With the help of a mathematical model for photon 
diffusion the optically detected signal is processed to detect a 

predetermined parameter which is processed to 
measure internal information in the scattering medium with high 

accuracy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of measuring a
characteristic of a scattering medium and apparatus for
the same.Embodiments of the invention relate to the
measurement of internal information in a scattering
medium by making light having various incident angle
components to be incident on the scattering medium, and
detecting light diffused during propagation in the
scattering medium and more particularly, to a method
for measuring internal information in a scattering
medium and an apparatus for the same, which are capable
of measuring absolute values of an absorption
coefficient and a transport scattering coefficient of
the scattering medium, absolute quantities of a
specific absorptive constituent and a specific
scattering constituent, degree of oxygen saturation of
hemoglobin, their time changes, their spatial
distributions etc. and which are capable of improving
measurement accuracy.Demands for precise measurement of an absorption
coefficient, a scattering coefficient and a transport
scattering coefficient in a scattering medium such as a
living body, the concentration of a specific absorptive 
constituent, an absolute quantity of a specific
absorptive constituent, their time changes, and their
spacial distributions are very strong. There are
several attempts therefore such as a method using
continuous light, or modulated light (e.g., pulsed
light, square wave light, sinusoidal wave modulated
light etc.), and a method using lights having different
wavelengths (e.g., dual wavelength spectroscopy). It
has been known that the behavior of light diffused
during propagation in the scattering medium can be
analyzed, experimented and examined in accordance with
Monte Carlo calculation with use of a computer, and can
be described and analyzed with a photon diffusion
theory. Present conditions with regard to measurement
of a scattering medium are described in detail, e.g.,
in the following references 1)-5) (note that

reference number X) or a superscript in sentences).1) B. C. Wilson and S. L. Jacques: Optical Reflectance
