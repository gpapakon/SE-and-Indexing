<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing an abrasive compact, particularly a diamond 
abrasive compact, is provided. The method uses conventional compact 

manufacture conditions and is characterised by the mass of abrasive 
particles which is used. This mass has an average particle size of less 

than 20 and consists of particles having at least three different average 
particle sizes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of making an abrasive compact. Abrasive compacts are used extensively in cutting, milling, grinding, 
drilling and other abrasive operations. Abrasive compacts consist of a 
mass of diamond or cubic boron nitride particles bonded into a 
coherent, polycrystalline conglomerate. The abrasive particle content of 
abrasive compacts is high and there is generally an extensive amount of 
direct particle-to-particle bonding. Abrasive compacts are generally 
made under elevated temperature and pressure conditions at which the 
abrasive particle, be it diamond or cubic boron nitride, is 
crystallographically stable. Abrasive compacts tend to be brittle and in use they are frequently 
supported by being bonded to a cemented carbide substrate or support. 
Such supported abrasive compacts are known in the art as composite 
abrasive compacts. Composite abrasive compacts may be used as such 
in a working surface of an abrasive tool. Examples of composite abrasive compacts can be found described in 
United States Patent Specifications Nos. 3,745,623, 3,767,371 and 
3,743,489.  
 Composite abrasive compacts are generally produced by placing the 
components, in particulate form, necessary to form an abrasive compact 
on a cemented carbide substrate. This unbonded assembly is placed in 
a reaction capsule which is then placed in the reaction zone of a 
conventional high pressure/high temperature apparatus. The contents 
of the reaction capsule are subjected to suitable conditions of elevated 
temperature and pressure. United States Patent No. 4,861,350 describes a tool component 
comprising an abrasive compact bonded to a cemented carbide support 
in which the abrasive compact has two zones which are joined by an 
interlocking, common boundary. The one zone provides the cutting edge 
or point for the tool component, while the other zone is bonded to the 
cemented carbide support. In one embodiment of the tool component, 
the zone which provides the cutting edge or point has ultra-hard abrasive 
particles which are finer than the ultra-hard abrasive particles in the 
other zone. There is no disclosure of using a mixture of ultra-hard 
abrasive particles of different particle size. United States Patent No. 4,311,490 describes an abrasive compact 
wherein the bonded abrasive particles comprise a coarse layer and a fine 
layer. Again, the use of a mixture of abrasive particles of different 
particle size is not disclosed. United States Patent No. 4,604,106 describes a composite diamond 
abra
