<DESCRIPTION>
 IndoHzines as herbicidesThe present invention relates to herbicidal compositions containing bicyclic compounds to novel herbicidal bicyclic compounds and to processes for their preparation.Certain indolizine-5,8-diones are known in the chemical literature (see Tet. Lett. 33, pp 7811-7814 1992 and J. Chem. Soc Perkin Trans 1 1990, pp 1463-1467) .The applicants have found that such compounds and related compounds are useful as herbicides.According to the present invention there is provided a herbicidal composition comprising a compound of formula (I), or a tautomer or a1 2 quaternised derivative thereof where Y is a group of formula -CR =CR -C0- and R , R , R , R and R are independently selected from hydrogen; optionally substituted alkyl; optionally substituted alkenyl; optionally substituted alkynyl; optionally substituted aryl; optionally substituted aromatic heterocyclic; halo; nitro; cyano; a group OR where R is hydrogen or a salt thereof, carboxy or an ester thereof, optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted alkenyl, optionally substituted alkynyl, or optionally substituted aryl; carboxy or a salt, ester or amide derivative thereof; S(0) R where n is 0, 1 or 2 and R is optionally alkyl, optionally substituted alkenyl, optionally substituted alkynyl or8 9 8 9 optionally substituted aryl; NR R where R and R are independently selected from hydrogen, optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted alkenyl, optionally substituted alkynyl or optionally9 8 9 substituted aryl and R may additionally be acyl, or R and R together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a heterocyclic ring; or R and R and/or any adjacent two of R , R and R together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached form an optionally substituted fused saturated or unsaturated carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring; in combination with a carrier or diluent.Examples of such compositions are those compositions comprising a1 2 3 4 5 compound of formula (I), where R , R , R , R and R are independently selected from hydrogen; optionally substituted alkyl; optionally substituted alkenyl; optionally substituted alkynyl; optionally substituted aryl; optionally substituted aromatic heterocyclic; halo; nitro; cyano; a group OR where R is hydrogen, optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted alkenyl, optionally substituted alkynyl, or optionally 

substituted aryl; carboxy or a salt, ester or amide derivative thereof; S(0) R where n is 0, 1 or 2 and R is optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted
