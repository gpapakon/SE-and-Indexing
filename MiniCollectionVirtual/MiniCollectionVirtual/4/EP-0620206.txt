<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method for inhibiting polymerizable 
(meth)acrylic acid and esters thereof from polymerizing 

during their production, transportation and storage by using 
as the inhibitor (A) at least one N-oxyl compound, (B) at 

least one phenol compound, and (C) at least one 
phenothiazine compound in combination with one another. (A) 

is selected from 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinooxyl, 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinooxyl, 
and 4,4',4''-tris-(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinooxyl)phosphite, 

and 
combinations thereof and the phenol compound is hydroquinone 

and/or methoquinone. The combined use of the three 
inhibitors provides an inhibiting effect which is superior 

to their use alone or in pairs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for inhibiting the
polymerization of (meth)acrylic acid monomers and (meth)acrylate
monomers (referred to as (meth)acrylic acid and esters thereof
hereinafter) that will otherwise take place during their production.
In the present invention the term "(meth)acrylic acid" means
"acrylic acid or methacrylic acid".It is well-known that (meth)acrylic acid and esters thereof
have a strong tendency to spontaneous polymerization by light or
heat. Hence, it is common practice to add one inhibitor or more
in combination to inhibit polymerization during their storage.An example of the inhibitors which have so far been tried is
N-oxyl compounds, such as di-tert-butyl nitroxide and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-hydroxypiperidinooxyl(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-hydroxypiperidine-1-oxyl),
as disclosed in British Patent No.
1,127,127. According to the disclosure, they are more effective
than known inhibitors such as hydroquinone, phenothiazine, and
cupric chloride, when they are used alone. The N-oxyl compound 
is also used as an inhibitor in the production of methacrylic
acid from methacrolein by the aid of an oxygen-containing gas in
an organic solvent. It includes 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-hydroxypiperidinooxyl
and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinooxyl as disclosed
in U.S. Patent No. 4,127,603. It also includes 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-oxopyrrolidinooxyl
and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-acetoxypiperidinooxyl
as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication
No. 46496/1983. In addition, it is shown in Chinese Patent
Laid-Open No. 1,052,847A that 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-hydroxypiperidinooxyl
effectively inhibits the polymerization of acrylic acid
and acrylate when used alone or in combination with hydroquinone
and that this(or these) inhibitor(s) is(are) more effective than
copper dibutyldithiocarbamate and hydroquinone used in combination.Contrary to the foregoing, the present inventors have found
that the N-oxyl compound used alone or in combination with hydroquinone
does not work satisfactorily under specific conditions.
In other words, the above-mentioned inhibitor used in an ordinary
amount does not work in the production of (meth)acrylic acid by
catalytic gas phase reaction, because polymerization of
(meth)acrylic acid easily occurs while it is separated by azeotropic
distillation from its aqueous solution containing acetic
acid and aldehydes. Thus, there was a problem of the formation
of popcorn polymers and sticky polymers in the distillation
column during distillation, which prevents the continuous
