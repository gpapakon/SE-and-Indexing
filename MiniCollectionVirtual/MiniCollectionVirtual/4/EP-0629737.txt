<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for producing a pitch cable which has a wire rope (1), a pitch helix (2) wound helically around the wire rope (1) and an insulating layer (5), for example a flocked thread, wound in between the turns of the pitch cable. In order to ensure that the insulating layer (5) is fixed effectively to the pitch cable, provision is made for first coating an adhesive onto the wire rope (1), then applying the pitch helix (2) to the wire rope (1) and finally winding in the insulating layer (5) between the turns of the pitch cable.
