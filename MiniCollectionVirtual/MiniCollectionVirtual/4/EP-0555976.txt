<ABSTRACT>
A metal mold cooling device capable of employing a 
cooling pipe (5) having a small diameter insertable into a 

cooling hole (4) having a small diameter, and capable of performing 
fine supply control of a cooling liquid to the metal 

mold (1,2) for fine temperature control thereto. A cooling pipe 
is connected to a compressed air source (19) through a pipe and 

a first change-over valve (8). Further, the pipe is connected to 
a branch pipe t
o which a second change-over valve (9) is connected. 
A hermetic cooling liquid tank (15) connected to a water 

source is connected to the second change-over valve (9). A third 
change-over valve (10) is provided between the compressed air 

source (19) and the cooling liquid tank (15) so as to apply pneumatic 
pressure onto a surface of the cooling liquid in the 

cooling liquid tank (15). Since the cooling liquid tank (15) is 
provided in addition to the water source, pneumatic pressure 

from the compressed air source (19) can be utilized. The 
cooling liquid in the cooling liquid tank is compressed and 

is supplied to the cooling pipe. Therefore, spraying is 
achievable even by a cooling pipe (5) having a small diameter. 

Further, supply of the cooling liquid can be finely controlled 
by controlling valve opening timing of each of the 

change-over valves.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metal mold cooling
device, and more particularly, to such device capable of
introducing sufficient amount of a cooling liquid into a
cooling hole of the metal mold, the hole having relatively
small diameter.Cooling to the metal mold at every predetermined cycle
is required so as to produce desirable casted products. To
this effect, conventionally, a cooling liquid such as a
water is ejected into a cooling hole formed in the metal
mold so as to remove evaporation heat therefrom. For example,
according to the metal mold cooling technique disclosed
in Japanese Patent Application Kokai Nos. 61-108462 and 63-299848,
a pipe connected to an air source is inserted into
the cooling hole drilled into the metal mold, and a water
supplying pipe branched from the pipe is connected to a
water tank. Water in the water tank is introduced into the
pipe through the water supplying pipe by making use of a
negative pressure generated within the pipe for ejecting the
water at a tip end of the pipe.Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 60-72641 discloses
improvement in a metal mold temperature control in 
which a cooling passage is provided in the metal mold for
selectively ejecting one of liquid, gas(air) and liquid/gas
mixture into the passage. To this effect, a cooling pipe is
connected to an inlet opening of the cooling passage, and
the cooling pipe is branched into first branch pipe to which
a liquid tank is connected and a second branch pipe to which
a an air tank is connected. The first and second branch
pipes have first and second change-over valves, respectively.
By controlling valve opening timing of these change-over
valves by means of a timer, one of the liquid, gas and
liquid/gas mixture is selectively introduced into the cooling
passage.However, in the device disclosed in the Japanese
patent application Kokai Nos. 61-108462 and 63-299848,
cooling liquid ejection from the ejection opening of the
pipe is only achievable in a case where a cross-sectional
area of the pipe is greater than that of the water supplying
pipe. It is impossible to perform water ejection if the
cross-sectional area of the pipe is smaller than that of the
water supplying pipe. Therefore, if the pipe has a small
cross-sectional area, the cross-sectional area of the water
supplying pipe must be designed to be further smaller than
that of the pipe. As a result, insufficient cooling water
supply results. Particularly, if the cooling hole has an
extremely small diameter to such extent of a tip end portion 
of a
