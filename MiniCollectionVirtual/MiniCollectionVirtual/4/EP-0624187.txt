<ABSTRACT>
Use of polyethylene imine or imines for cleaning equipment of amino resins. The polyethylene imine or imines are preferably utilised in the form of an aqueous solution. The amount of polyethylene imine or imines used lies within a range of from about 0.005 % by weight to about 10 % by weight of pure polyethylene imine, based on the amount of resin to be washed away. The polyethylene imine or imines may be used for cleaning different sorts of glue spreading equipment of glue.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CLEANING OF EQUIPMENT WITH RESPECT TO AMINO RESINSThe present invention relates to the cleaning of equipment of amino resins. More precisely, the invention concerns the use of polyethylene imine or imines for Ξ cleaning equipment of amino resins.In the woodworking industry, large amounts cf a ino- resin-based glues are used for making e.g. furniture, parquet floors, laminates and particle boards. These glues are based on formaldehyde and amino-containing compounds, 0 such as urea, melamine and benzoguanamine. The urea-formal¬ dehyde resins (commonly referred to as urea glues) are the most common. The glues are applied by means cf different; sorts of glue spreading equipment, such as roller spreaders and ribbon spreaders, or by spraying. Further, amino resms 5 are used also in other fields, e.g. in lacquers and paper additives.Cleaning equipment of amino resins may pose serious problems. The situation has been aggravated in recent years, since the formaldehyde content of the amino resins 0 has been significantly reduced. The synthesis of amino resins having a high molar ratio of formaldehyde to amino compound yields a product with a high concentration cf hydrophilic methylolic compounds. These compounds are relatively easy to disperse and dilute in water, which 5 facilitates the cleaning of the resins. However, the dilution of amino resins having a low molar ratio may result in a rubber- or latex-like sticky mass which iε difficult to wash away. The structure of this mass is not known, but may consist of a mixture of oligomers or other C small molecules and crystalline compounds of amino-resir: type which, when diluted, form floes or gel-like states.The cleaning problems are also linked with the waste disposal of amino-resin residues. Basically, there are three feasible ways of taking care of the amino-re-sin- 5 containing wash water. Thus, one may resort to acid curing, 'combustion or simply discharge into the municipal sewage syεtem. Acid curing yields a hard, essentially insoluble ammo elastic which has to be treated as solid waste wmcr- 

releases formaldehyde. The combustion of wash water essen¬ tially requires that the resin residues are readily dis¬ persed in water to obtain a manageable dispersion. Normal¬ ly, it is not allowed to dump the resin residues directly in the municipal sewage system. Dumping requires that the resin concentration be brought to an acceptably low level by dilution.DE 39 01 328 discloses a washing solution for clean¬ ing containers and glue spreading equipment of
