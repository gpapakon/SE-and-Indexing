<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an elastic hinge for glasses 
of the type which comprises, at the end of a temple, an 

elongated hollow body which has a flat end; the body 
contains an elastic means which is arranged between the head 

of a pin that passes axially through it and a contrast 
element which is locked therein. The pin passes through the 

contrast element and engages a first hinge part to which a 
second hinge part is pivoted; the second hinge part is fixed 

to the front of the glasses and has a polygonal profile in 
which one side rests on the flat end of the hollow body. The 

hinge is characterized in that the contrast element has at 
least one external seat that accommodates and locks at least 

one portion of the hollow body which is deformed plastically 
by calking or by means of an equivalent operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an elastic hinge for 
glasses. Currently commercially available elastic hinges for 
glasses substantially comprise, at the end of a temple, an 
elongated hollow body which has a flat end and contains a 
spring arranged between the head of a pin, which passes 
axially through said spring, and a contrast element, which 
is locked inside said body. The pin passes through the contrast element and engages 
a first hinge part to which a second hinge part is pivoted; 
said second hinge part is fixed to the front of the glasses 
and has a polygonal profile in which one side rests on the 
flat end of the hollow body. All the parts contained in the hollow body are pre-assembled 
externally and then inserted in said body. The various hinge types differ essentially in the way 
in which the contrast element is locked inside the hollow 
body. A first type has a cylindrical contrast element 
provided with an external annular groove; a ball is inserted 
through an appropriate hole of the hollow body and is seated 
in a portion of said groove. The diameter of the ball is such that once it is 
inserted in the hollow body, the thrust of the spring locks 
it between one edge of the annular groove of the contrast 
element and the inner edge of the insertion hole. However, this locking action is not reliable, since any 
movements of the contrast element that compress the spring 
can reduce the pressure of the contact edges on the ball and  
 
may allow it to leave its seat, consequently disassembling 
the hinge. In a second type of locking, the contrast element is 
again cylindrical in shape, with an external annular groove 
to be placed at a bore formed inside the hollow body. Locking occurs by inserting a snap ring between the 
seat of the contrast element and the bore. In practice, after pre-assembling the various hinge 
parts, the snap ring is placed in the annular seat of the 
contrast element and is deformed elastically, by means of an 
appropriate tool, so that it enters the hollow body. When it reaches the bore, the snap ring expands and 
locks the contrast element inside the body. As regards this type of execution, it should be noted 
that the formation of the bore is a rather complicated 
operation in view of the small size of the parts; the need 
to use a tool to insert the hinge parts in the hollow body 
has furthermore limited the success of this solution. Another type of locking includes a screw, or an elastic 
pin, which passes through the hollow body and arranges 
itself in a

Elastic hinge for glasses of the type which 
comprises, at the end of a temple, an elongated hollow body 

which has a flat end, said body containing an elastic means 
which is arranged between the head of a pin that passes 

axially through it and a contrast element which is locked 
therein, said pin passing through said contrast element and 

engaging a first hinge part to which a second hinge part is 
pivoted, said second hinge part being fixed to the front of 

the glasses and having a polygonal profile in which one side 
rests on the flat end of said hollow body, said hinge being 

characterized in that said contrast element has at least one 
external seat that accommodates and locks at least one 

portion of said hollow body which is deformed plastically by 
calking or by means of an equivalent operation. 
Elastic hinge according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said at least one external seat of said contrast 

element is constituted by an annular groove. 
Elastic hinge according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said contrast 

element is substantially cylindrical, has an axial through 
hole for said pin, and has a diametrical slot for the 

insertion of said first hinge part.

preced
ing claims, characterized in that said contrast 
element is made of stainless steel or equivalent material 

which is not subjected to deformation by the calking of said 
body.
