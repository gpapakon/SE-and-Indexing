<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a novel micro-capsule 
toner, having a constitution and features absolutely 

differing the conventional counterpart, that has fully 
solved the conventional problem that the pattern may 

vanish. The toner is a novel thermal micro-capsule 
toner in which the micro-capsule is composed of two or 

more types of compositions, and in which a component 
that will be thermally decomposed to generate a gas 

has been added to the shell or core of the microcapsule 
of the compositions, or to the interface 

between the shell and the core. The toner is added to 
a paint or an adhesive, or applied onto a carrier, or 

added to a moldable resin. By directly or indirectly 
heating, the toner allows a nonvolatile pattern to be 

developed. The micro-capsule will rupture by simple 
heating so that a nonvolatile pattern is obtained. It 

becomes possible to print characters and images on 
various materials such as paper, synthetic resins, 

woods, and metals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel 
nonvolatile thermal micro-capsule toner applicable to 
various fields, for drawing on paintings nonvolatile 
patterns that will not vanish, or for providing 
nonvolatile storage media by applying the toner onto 
paper or other carriers and heating it to print 
characters and images or by applying the toner onto a 
disk and impressing it with a laser beam, or for 
giving printed characters and images and the like that 
will not vanish by adding the toner to a moldable 
resin and, after molding, heating it. Conventionally, there have been available 
toners, for example, a thermally fixing use toner, 
with which a developed image of toner formed by the 
electrophotography, electrostatic printing, electric 
charge recording, and the like is fixed to a recording 
member by heating (Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
Publication No. HEI 3-139663); a thermal roller fixing 
use micro-capsule type toner in similar use (Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open Publication No. SHO 61-56352); and a 
toner composition and the like which comprises toner  
 
particles composed of binder resin and coloring agent, and 
an additive smaller in mean particle size than the toner 
particles adhering onto the surface of the toner particles, 
the additive being composed of inorganic particles, the 
additive comprising an inorganic fine powder and a silicon 
oxide film chemically bonded onto the surface of the 
inorganic fine powder (Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
Publication No. HEI 3-150574). Furthermore, there has been 
proposed an invention of micro-capsule toner in which its 
core material containing an abrasive material is coated 
with a shell material (Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
Publication No. SHO 61-99154). All of the above-described conventional toners, 
including thermal fixing use toners, thermal roller fixing 
use micro-capsule type toners or press-fixing use micro-capsule 
toners and moreover color toners, have been 
energetically investigated for the purpose of providing a 
toner good at fixing property when the toner is to be fixed 
by heating on recording paper or the like, or providing a 
color toner having a high image density and an excellent 
thin-line reproducibility in the case of color toners. 
However, conventional thermal toners have been mainly of 
the type that their chemical structure thermally varies and 
therefore, although high in thermal sensitivity, they are  
 
poor in environmental resistance, so that the pattern may vanish 
disadvantageously. It is therefore an object of the

<CLAIMS>
Microcapsules for use as a thermal toner having a core 
comprising a first component and a shell comprising a second 

component, the first and second components being inorganic pigments 
of different colours, and a third component, added to the shell or the 

core or to an interface between the shell and the core, capable of being 
thermally decomposed to generate a gas, wherein the colour of the first 

component is concealed by the second component in each microcapsule 
and the colour of the first component becomes visible when the second 

component is removed by the generation of the gas. 
A composition comprising microcapsules according to claim 1 
which is a paint, an adhesive, a carrier or a moldable resin. 
A method for developing a non-volatile pattern comprising 
heating, directly or indirectly, microcapsules according to claim 1.
