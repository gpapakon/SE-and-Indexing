<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a blend of cellulose acetate and starch acetate for fibers, 
filaments, yarns, plastic materials, and other uses. More particularly, this invention relates 
to a blend of 50 to 99% cellulose acetate with 1-50% starch acetate for the production of 
fibers, filaments, yarns, fabrics, plastic materials, and other uses. Additionally, this 
invention relates to the process of making said blend, cigarette filters made from tow made 
of said blend, cigarettes made with filters made from tow of said blend, filaments and 
fabrics containing said blend, acetate flake containing said blend and other compositions 
containing the blend. Both cellulose acetate and starch acetate have been known since the 19th century. 
However, a blend of these two common materials has not before been available due to 
processing problems. Cellulose acetate of certain acetylation degrees is commonly used to manufacture 
cigarette tow, textile fibers, films, plastics and other materials. However, cellulose acetate 
as derived from wood pulp is expensive and requires the use of large amounts of acetone 
in processing resulting in high acetone recovery costs and possibly harmful acetone 
emissions. Starch acetate, depending on the degree of substitution (DS) of the free 
hydroxyl groups, may be used in a number of commercially important ways. Low DS 
acetates are important in food applications while highly derivatized starches with a DS of 
2-3 are useful because of their solubility in organic solvents and ability to form films and 
fibers. Starch, to be used as a raw material for the preparation of starch acetate, is low 
cost and produces higher solids concentration in the acetylation process as compared with 
wood pulp acetylation. A blend of cellulose acetate with starch acetate offers the possibility to combine a 
cheap raw material, starch, with the production of a fiber of the same or better quality and  
 
enhanced properties as compared with fibers made of cellulose acetate alone. The 
improved quality results from the molecular structure of starch as compared to wood pulp. 
Dry starch is generally a 25/75% mix of linear amylose and branched amylopectin 
polymer of Î±-D-glucopyranosyl units. Amylose has an average molecular weight of 
17,000-225,000 with a degree of polymerization (DP) of about 100-1400. Amylopectin 
has an average molecular weight of 200,000 - greater than 1,000,000. Dry wood pulp, the 
raw material used in the production of cellulose acetate, consists of 100% cellulose with 
an
