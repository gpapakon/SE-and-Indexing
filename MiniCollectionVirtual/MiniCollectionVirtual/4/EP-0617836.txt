<ABSTRACT>
The automatic cutout switch has inside its housing (1) an arc chamber (2) containing a stack of quenching plates (3) which communicates behind a slotted (2b) separating wall (2a) with an outwardly open blow-off chamber (4). In order to reduce considerably the ejection of hot conductive arc gases and also largely to prevent the exit of flames from the housing at breaking capacity, the blow-off chamber (4), consisting of two half shells (1a, 1b) of the housing (1), has several staggered walls (4a) transversely to the main direction of flow, like a labyrinthe which considerably lengthen the gas flow path. In addition, the walls (4a) have, on their facing upper sides substantially parallel to the separating plane of the half-shell (1a, 1b), comb-like projecting pegs (4a') which cool the arc gases and cause them to eddy. The walls (4a) are preferably arranged at least partially to inter-engage at a short distance from each other alternately at each half-section (1a, 1b).

Circuit breaker with an arcing chamber (2), which is arranged 
within the housing (1) of the circuit breaker, receives a metal 

quenching plate stack (3) and which behind a partition (2a) provided 
with slots (2b) passes over into an outwardly open blow-out chamber 

(4, 4′), which in its turn displays walls (4a) shaped on transversely 
to the main flow direction at two half shells (1a, 1b) of the housing 

(1), characterised thereby, that the blow-out chamber (4, 4′) is 
provided with several walls (4a), which each rise up from the base of 

the half shells (1a, 1b) to at least over the centre of the housing 
(1), are arranged displaced in alternation and appreciably prolong 

the gas flow path and of which at least some display spigots (4a′), 
which project in comblike manner on their mutually facing upper sides 

situated about parallelly to the plane of separation of the half 
shells (1a, 1b) and cause a turbulence and additional cooling of the 

arc gases. 
Switch according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the 
walls (4a) are arranged to be at least partially interengaging at a 

slight mutual spacing in such a manner that the running speed of the 
arc from the contact place (5) into the metal quenching plate stack 

(3) is hardly impaired in spite of high cooling of the arc and low 
ejection of conductive arc gases. 
Switch according to claim 1 and 2, characterised thereby, that 
only the walls (4a) of one half shell (1a) display spigots (4a′) on 

their upper side, whilst the walls (4a) of the opposite half shell 
(1b) are formed to have a smooth surface. 
Switch according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised 
thereby, that the blow-out chamber (4, 4′) is subdivided into two 

almost equally large half spaces, which are each separated from the 
other, by means of a rib (4d), which starts out from about the centre 

of the partition (2a) and extends in part obliquely to the walls 
(4a).  

 
Switch according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised 
thereby, that the blow-out chamber (4′) is provided at its outwardly 

open side wall (1d) with blow-out nozzles (4c) arranged obliquely to 
the direction of the walls (4a). 
Switch according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterised 
thereby, that the blow-out nozzles (4c) in both the half shells (1a, 

1b) display different angles of direction of up to 90° and are 
arranged to be displaced in meander shape in cross-section.
