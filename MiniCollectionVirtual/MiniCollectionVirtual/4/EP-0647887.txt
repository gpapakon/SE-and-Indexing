<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electrophotographic carrier particles coating composition.As is well known, developers for two-component type dry copying machines contain two main particulate components: fine particulate toners and larger sized carrier particles. By mixing and stirring these two components together, each toner and carrier becomes electrostatically charged with different signs from each other.
The visible image is formed by electrostatically depositing the charged toner on an electrostatic latent image formed on a photosensitive substance. The copying is completed by transferring this image to a transfer sheet and fixing it.In this case, oxidized or unoxidized iron powders are typically used as carriers. However, when these carriers are mixed with the toner particles, their triboelectric properties toward the toner are insufficient. In addition, during use, the toner particles tend to stick to the surface of the carrier particles forming a toner film thereon (which is called spent phenomenon). As a result, the charge characteristics of the carrier disadvantageously vary with time and the lifetime of the developer becomes shortened.In order to prevent such disadvantages, there is a popular trend to cover the surface of the carrier with resins such as fluorine resins, acrylic resins, styrene-acryl copolymers, silicone resins, and polyester resins. However, in the cases where polyester resins having hydroxyl groups and acrylic resins are used as the coating, crosslinking is performed through the use of, for example, isocyanates and melamines [Japanese Patent applications Kokai (laid open) 59-53875 and 60-59369]. If incomplete crosslinking occurs, residual hydroxyl groups and isocyanate groups will be present, which worsen the charge characteristics.When acrylic resins and styrene-acrylic copolymers are used as the coating, the initial charge characteristics are superior. However, the fragile coating films have the disadvantage of low endurance. The fluorine resins and silicone resins, on the other hand, possess a low surface energy. Therefore, these coatings are receiving attention from the viewpoint of reduced spent phenomenon [Japanese Patent applications Kokai 54-21730 and 58-40557, and Japanese Patent applications Kokoku (examined) 59-26945 and 59-131944].particularly in the case of silicone resins, the selection of monomers leads to a variety of molecular structures. Therefore, their selection enables one to prepare carriers with various levels in the amount of charge. In addition, the
