<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an asymmetrical, electro-mechanical 
device which may act as a motor or a generator. In 
particular, the invention relates to an improved and efficient 
generator/motor. Of course, electro-mechanical devices which act as motors 
and generators are known. However, it is always important to 
improve upon the prior electro-mechanical devices and, in 
particular, to improve the efficiency of those devices. It is known from FR-A-2603433 to have a generator/motor with 
two rotors magnetically connected to each other, and two 
discontinuous stators magnetically connected to each other. The 
two rotors and two stators define a continuous magnetic flux path 
from a first discontinuous stator, through the first rotor to the 
second rotor to the second discontinuous stator. At all times, 
a part of the first rotor is adjacent a part of the first stator 
and a part of the second rotor is adjacent a part of the second 
stator completing the magnetic circuit. It is also known from FR-A-2616980 to have generator/motor 
with a rotor having three pole faces. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to at least 
partially improve upon the prior art devices, particularly by  
 
improving the efficiency of the prior art devices. Also, it is 
an object of this invention to provide an alternative type of 
electro-mechanical device, namely an asymmetrical electro-mechanical 
device. Accordingly, in one of its broad aspects, this invention 
resides in providing an asymmetrical, electro-mechanical device 
comprising: 
(a) a geometrically-magnetically-asymmetrical stator means 
comprising: 
a non-continuous stator magnetic flux path extending from a 
first stator portion to a second stator portion; stator air gap extending from the second stator portion to 
the first stator portion; and  
 a stator face having a plurality of armature 
conductors extending substantially transversely across the 
stator face; (b) a rotor means having a rotor face and moving 
along a rotor movement path; (c) a rotor/stator air gap between the rotor face and 
the stator face when the rotor face and the stator face 
are adjacent each other; (d) a continuous magnetic flux path extending along 
at least a portion of the stator magnetic flux path, 
through the stator face, through the rotor/stator air gap, 
into or out of the rotor face, through the rotor means, 
and through at least one magnetic flux connecting means 
which enables the magnetic flux path to be continuous; (e) magnetic flux generating means for generating
