<DESCRIPTION>
 RHENIUM-BOUND TUNGSTEN CARBIDE COMPOSITESThis invention generally concerns cemented refractory metal matrix composites. This invention particularly concerns rhenium-bound tungsten carbide, rhenium-bound hafnium carbide and rhenium-bound titanium carbide metal matrix composites. This invention more particularly concerns the use of substantially pure rhenium metal as a binder for tungsten carbide, hafnium carbide or titanium carbide.Cemented carbides, also known as "hard metals", conventionally include a basic carbide, such as tungsten carbide, and an iron group metal, such as cobalt, as a binder. U.S.-A 4,432,794 discloses binder metal alloys that comprise a solid alloy of a transition metal of Group IVb, Vb or VIb with Re, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir or Pt. Lisovsky et al., in "Structure of a Binding Phase in Re- -Alloyed WC-Co Cemented Carbides", Refractory Metals & Hard Materials , Volume 10 (1991), pages 33-36, discuss the effects of alloying WC-Co cemented carbides with rhenium.Tools made of cemented carbide, including WC-Co (tungsten carbide-cobalt) as a typical composition, are widely used in the machining field. The alloy compositions, characteristics, uses and applications of 

such cemented carbide materials are summarized in Cemented Carbides for Engineers and Tool Users, International Carbide Data (1983).Summary of the InventionThe present invention is a dense refractory composition consisting essentially of rhenium in an amount within a range of from 1 to 25 percent by weight of composition and a refractory metal carbide selected from tungsten carbide, hafnium carbide and titanium carbide in an amount within a range of from 75 to 99 percent by weight of composition.The dense refractory compositions can be used in any one of a number of conventional applications for hard metals. One such application is as a cutting tool used in machining or cutting a variety of materials such as metals, plastics and wood products. Cutting tools include indexable inserts, end mills, router bits, reamers, drills, saw blades and knives.Description of Preferred EmbodimentsThe refractory metal carbide is suitably tungsten carbide, hafnium carbide or titanium carbide. Tungsten carbide yields particularly desirable results. The tungsten carbide has an average grain size that is suitably about ten micrometers or less, beneficially about five micrometers or less, desirably about one micrometer or less, and preferably from 0.4 to 0.8 micrometer. Acceptable grain sizes for other carbides approximate those for tungsten carbide
