<ABSTRACT>
An improvement in a bin-type, bulk fluid 
container (10). The container (10) comprises a rigid carton (12) 

containing a plastic bag (20). The bag (20) has an evacuation 
element (21) in its bottom. The bag (20) rests on an insert (30) in 

the carton (12). The insert (30) comprises a body molded in one 
piece from relatively dense, expanded plastic. The 

insert (30) includes an upper panel (33) supported by walls and 
partitions (44) between the walls (43). The upper panel (33) has an 

aperture (55) through it for the evacuation element (21) and forms 
a generally funnel-shaped surface inclined downwardly to 

the aperture (55).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to bin-type, bulk fluid 
containers. It relates particularly to a bin-type bulk 
fluid container with an evacuation orifice at the bottom 
of the bin. Bin-Type bulk liquid containers are generally 
used for the storage and transportation of large 
quantities of liquids. The containers comprise a rigid 
carton, usually constructed of corrugated cardboard or 
other lightweight fiber or paper materials, and are 
manufactured in standard sizes: 55 gallon, 110 gallon, 
220 gallon, 275 gallon, 300 gallon, and 330 gallon 
capacities. The dimensions of the containers allow for 
mounting on standard-sized, rectangular loading pallets. 
These bulk containers offer substantial economic 
advantages over traditional metal drums or barrels 
because the bulk containers weigh less and are made from 
recyclable materials. Furthermore, the containers are 
manufactured in interlocking geometric sizes and shapes 
which simplify storage and minimize wasted storage 
space. For instance, intermediate size bulk containers 
may be stacked several units high. These advantages 
lead to lower freight rates, manufacturing ease, ease of 
operation, lower overall costs, and substantial space 
savings. A bulk container for storing or transporting 
liquids also conventionally comprises a polyethylene bag 
placed within the rigid carton to hold the liquid 
product. The bag normally has a spigot, valve, or 
sealed tube molded into it to permit evacuation of the 
liquid from the filled bag. When the bag is positioned  
 
inside the carton, this evacuation element projects 
through a small opening or orifice in the side of the 
carton, near the bottom. The carton effectively causes the liquid-filled 
polyethylene bag to conform to the shape of the 
carton. The bag is susceptible to rupture during 
transport, however, due to inertial movement or 
"splashing" of the liquid within the bag. The hydraulic 
energy of the liquid during movement sometimes causes 
the bag to stretch and crack. This problem is more 
significant when the bag is filled with liquids that are 
not too viscous. The polyethylene bag is subject 
to increased stretching and an increased possibility of 
rupture if an air space is left between the filled bag 
and the top of the carton. The fluid transport and 
storage industry deals with this problem by filling this 
air space with dunnage to absorb some of the hydraulic 
energy of the liquid. The dunnage used is lightweight 
and compressible, and prevents the fluid-filled bag from 
shifting

<CLAIMS>
In a bin-type, bulk fluid container where the 
container includes a carton having a bottom wall, side 

walls and a top wall, with an orifice formed in the 
bottom wall between said side walls and a bag for 

holding fluid disposed within said carton and having a 
drainage element adapted to fit through the orifice, the 

improvement comprising: 

a) a removable insert mounted in said carton 
underneath said bag; 
b) an aperture through said insert in 
registry with said orifice; 
c) said insert having a support surface on 
which said bag rests; 
d) a plurality of inclined partition panels 
disposed beneath said support surface, 

said support surface having two side 
panels and a plurality of inclined 

partition panels extending parallel to 

the side panels; 
e) said support surface having a shape 
effective to deform said bag so as to 

cause liquid in said bag to flow by 
gravity toward said drainage element. 
The improvement in a bulk fluid container of 
Claim 1, further characterized in that: 


a) said bag support surface includes a 
surface section inclined downwardly 

toward said orifice. 
The improvement in a bulk fluid container of 
Claim 2, further characterized in that: 
a) said bag support surface includes a 
plurality of surface sections each 

inclined downwardly toward said orifice. 
The improvement in a bulk fluid container of 
Claim 3, further characterized in that: 


a) said insert is formed in one piece of 
molded plastic. 
The improvement in a bulk fluid container of 
Claim 3, further characterized in that: 


a) said insert is made from a foam polymer 
selected from the group including 

polyethylene and polypropylene. 
The improvement in a bulk fluid container of 
Claim 1, further characterized in that: 


a) said carton has an octagonal shape; 
b) said insert is octagonal in plan 
configuration so as to fit 

complementarily in said carton.
