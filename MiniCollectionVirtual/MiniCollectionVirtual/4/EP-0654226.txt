<ABSTRACT>
An article of men's underwear provided with a front aperture 
bounded by two edges (2,2') and characterised by comprising 

in correspondence with the front portion of a waistband (4) 
two strips for independently supporting said edges (2,2'), at 

least one of which is slidable along its respective strip 
between a position in which the two edges are at least partly 

superposed and a position in which they are spaced apart.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an article of men's underwear. Known articles of men's underwear, of the briefs or 
boxer shorts type, are generally provided with a front 
aperture used for satisfying the usual physiological needs 
without having to completely lower the article of underwear. Two basic types of aperture currently exist, 
distinguished respectively by having their edges side by side 
or their edges superposed. In the first case it is 
preferable, for evident reasons of hygiene and comfort, that 
said edges be provided with suitable means for retaining them 
in their side-by-side state, whereas in the second case the 
fact that they are superposed makes such retention means superfluous. 
One example of wearing apparel having a front aperture with superposed 
edges is described in GB-A-397 224. Apertures with superposed edges have proved rather 
inconvenient in use, whereas apertures with side-by-side 
edges do not suffer from this inconvenience if not provided 
with systems for retaining the edges side by side, however in 
that case there are obvious hygiene and comfort problems, 
whereas they are rather complicated to use if provided with 
retention means whether of zip or button type. The main object of the invention is to obviate these 
drawbacks by providing an article of men's underwear 
comprising a front aperture bounded by two edges which are  
 
superposed only when said aperture is not to be used. A further object of the invention is to provide an 
article of men's underwear which can be either of briefs type 
or of boxer shorts type. These and further objects which will be apparent from 
the description given hereinafter are attained according to 
the invention by an article of men's underwear as described 
in claim 1. A preferred embodiment of the present invention is 
described in detail hereinafter with reference to the 
accompanying drawing, in which: 
Figure 1is a front schematic view of an article of underwear 
according to the invention in its closed state; Figure 2shows the same view thereof but in its open state; 
and Figure 3is a schematic plan view showing the arrangement of 
the elastic waistband. As can be seen from the figures, the article of 
underwear according to the invention, in the form of boxer 
shorts, comprises a front aperture bounded by two 
superposable edges 2, 2' and is provided with an elastic 
waistband 4 which in correspondence with said aperture is 
split into two portions 6, 6', each of which is used for  
 
guiding one of said edges 2,2' which can
