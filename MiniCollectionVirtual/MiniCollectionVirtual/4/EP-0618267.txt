<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a resin composition
that contains a polyamide resin (referred to below as
"PA") and a polyphenylene ether resin (referred to below
as "PPE"), and in additional detail, concerns a
thermoplastic resin composition where yellowing due to
light is suppressed.EP-A-0375177 discloses a thermoplastic resin
composition with well balanced dimensional stability,
rigidity, heat resistance and impact strength, comprising
100 parts by weight of a resin comprising 5-95% by weight
of (a) a polyphenylene ether resin, (b) a mixture of a
polyphenylene ether resin and a styrene resin or (c) a
graft polymer of a polyphenylene ether resin and styrene
and 95-5% by weight of polyamide resin, 0-50 parts by
weight of a rubber-like material, 2.0-50 parts by weight
of an inorganic filler and/or glass fibres and a
compatibilizing agent which improves compatibility
between the polyphenylene resin and the polyamide resin.Resin compositions composed of a polyphenylene ether
resins and polyamide resins have excellent heat
resistance, molding properties, oil resistance and
organic solvent resistance. Because resin compositions
produced by adding an elastomer to such compositions have
excellent impact resistance as well, these compositions
can be used as automobile parts, electrical and
electronic parts and machine parts, and in particular,
because such materials can be painted on-line, they are
especially advantageous for use as external parts for
automobiles. For example, such compositions may be used
as external parts such as foil covers, bumpers and
spoilers, and external plate panels such as fenders. However, because PPE, which is the primary component in
PPE/PA resin compositions, has the characteristic of yellowing
when exposed to light, it is necessary to paint the composition
when it is to be used as an external part. In order to
completely prevent this yellowing phenomenon, a paint film must
be thickly and uniformly applied, but this is uneconomical and
inefficient. In addition, it is not easy to achieve uniform
application of the paint film, and there are cases where the
paint film is thin in areas, so that partial yellowing readily
occurs. In particular, an undesirable state of affairs occurs by
yellowing due to oily, cover materials, etc.The present invention offers a resin composition appropriate
for use in external parts for automobiles which has suppressed
yellowing due to light, while maintaining the superior
characteristics of PPE/PA resins.The present inventors, as a result of painstaking
