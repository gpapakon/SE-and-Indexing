<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a solid lavatory cleansing block 
comprising hydrogen peroxide or a source thereof, an acid and a 

surfactant. Said lavatory cleansing blocks are environmentally 
compatible, provide improved cleansing and disinfecting as well 

as limescale, odour and stain removal. Additionally, the blocks 
of the present invention prevent the formation of limescale. 

Also disclosed is the possible incorporation of an enzyme into 
said lavatory cleansing block.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid lavatory cleansing 
block. The blocks are environmentally safe and provide multiple 
benefits. The object of the present invention is to provide an 
environmentally safe lavatory cleansing block for use as in-rim 
and in-cistern type lavatory blocks. The lavatory block should 
have good bactericidal activity and sanitizing and cleansing 
performance. Additionally, the block should provide limescale 
removal and improved odor and stain removal. It has now been found that these objectives can be achieved 
by combining a source of active oxygen together with an acid in 
a solid lavatory block. Thus, as said lavatory blocks 
progressively dissolve in water, a permanent aqueous solution 
containing active oxygen and an acid is provided in the 
lavatory bowl.  An advantage of the present invention is that the ingredients 
remain permanently active in the water of the lavatory bowl in 
between flushes. In particular, the blocks according to the 
present invention thus provide the unexpected benefit that said 
blocks prevent the formation of limescale in said lavatory 
bowl. Lavatory blocks are well known in the art. EP-A-234 626 
discloses a solid lavatory cleansing block which contains an 
oxygen-type bleaching agent as in the present invention, but 
contains no acid. Similarly DE 3407 456 A1 discloses a solid 
bleaching block for in-cistern use. There is no acid component 
in this block. EP-A-462 643 discloses a rim-type solid 
lavatory cleansing block. The preferred water soluble bleaching 
agent therein is potassium dichloro cyanurate. Potassium 
dichloro cyanurate is not completely environmentally compatible 
whereas the sources of active oxygen as in the present 
invention are completely environmentally safe. The present invention is a solid lavatory cleansing block 
comprising a source of active oxygen, an acid and a surfactant, 
whereby said lavatory block provides a permanent aqueous 
solution having a pH below 7 and comprising from 1ppm to 500ppm 
active oxygen as said block is progressively dissolved in the 
lavatory bowl water. All ratios, percentages and parts given herein are "by 
weight" unless otherwise specified. The present invention relates to a solid lavatory cleansing 
block. There are two types of blocks available on the market at 
present, in-cistern and in-rim type lavatory blocks. The in-rim 
type blocks are distinct from in-cistern type blocks in that 
they are designed to be hung from the rim of the lavatory bowl, 
in a conventional type rim
