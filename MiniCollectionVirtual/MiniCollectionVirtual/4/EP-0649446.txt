<ABSTRACT>
A method for curing a composition and a curable composition, using at least one novolak resin; at least one resin curing agent selected from the group which consists of substituted melamines; at least one compound comprising at least one grouping (a), said compound having no methylol grouping and no ether grouping corresponding to the methylol; and/or at least one reagent which can yield such a compound under curing conditions. Resin curing is caused by the effects of heat.

A process according to Claim 1, characterised

weight of the novolac resin or of all the novolac

resins.
A process according to Claim 2, characterised

weight of the novolac resin or of all the novolac

resins.
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to

of all the compounds b) is between 0.5 and 200 parts by
weight, to 100 parts by weight of the novolac resin or

of all the novolac resins, the compound or compounds b)
being present in the composition or capable of

appearing in the composition after reaction of the
reagent or reagents producing this or these compounds

b).
A process according to Claim 4, characterised
in that the content of compound b) or of all the

compounds b) is between 10 and 100 parts by weight to
100 parts by weight of the novolac resin or of all the

least one or more rubbers.

in that the content of novolac resin or of all the

novolac resins is between 1 and 50 parts by weight to
100 parts by weight of the rubber or of all the

rubbers. 
A process according to Claim 7, characterised
in that the content of novolac resin or of all the

novolac resins is between 2 and 20 parts by weight to
100 parts by weight of the rubber or of all the

rubbers.
A process according to any one of Claims 6 to
8, characterised in that the composition comprises at

least one agent causing the cross-linking of the rubber
or rubbers, and in that the stiffening of the

composition is effected by heat as a result of both the
hardening of the resin or resins and the cross-linking

of the rubber or rubbers.
A process according to Claim 9, characterised
in that said agent is sulphur.
A process according to Claim 9, characterised
in 
that said agent is a peroxide.
A process according to any one of Claims 9 to
11, characterised in that two rubber compositions are

used, one, so-called "receiving", composition, which is
without at least one of the constituents defined by the

novolac resin, the hardener a), the compound b) or the
reagent(s) capable of producing the compound b), and

one, so-called "emitting", composition, comprising the
constituent(s) absent in the receiving composition, by

causing the migration of this constituent or these
constituents, from the emitting composition, into the

receiving composition, and in that the stiffening of
said receiving composition is then brought about.
