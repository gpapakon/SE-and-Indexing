<ABSTRACT>
A device (7) for testing the operation of smoke detectors (3) consists of a housing (1) open on one side which can be everted over the smoke detector (3) and in which there is a test light source (5) which can radiate pulsed light inside a smoke detector (3) to be tested. In a preferred embodiment there is also a test light receiver (4) which receives the light emitted by the smoke detection light source (15) of the smoke detector (3) and controls the test light source (5) dependently upon the light received. The light pulse from the test light source (5) is received by the smoke detection light receiver (14) of the smoke detector (3). It is possible to discover whether the smoke detector is in working order by checking whether it goes into its alarm mode.

Device for testing the operation of optical smoke
detectors employing the scattered-light principle, which

have a smoke-indicating light source (15) and a smoke-indicating
light detector (14), with a housing (1) open at

one end, which can be placed over the smoke detector (3)
under test, in which means are provided, with which the

occurrence of fire parameters is simulated inside the smoke
detector (3), 
characterised by
 a test light source (5)
provided inside the housing (1) and arranged so that light

emitted from it can be received by the smoke-indicating
light detector (14) of the smoke detector (3).
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised by
 a test
light detector (4) provided inside the housing (1) and

arranged so that it can receive light emitted by the smoke-indicating
light source (15) of the smoke detector (3).
Device according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 in
the housing (1), at its upper edge, positioning means

(8, 9) are provided and distributed over its periphery, by
which the device when placed over a smoke detector (3)

under test, in conjunction with guide means (11) provided
on the smoke detector, is aligned so that the test light

source (5) is in the same position with respect to the
smoke-indicating light detector (14) and the test light

detector (4) is in the same position with respect to the
smoke indicating light-source (15).
Device according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the
guide means provided on the smoke detector (3) are formed

by a guide lug (11) arranged on its outer side, and that
the positioning means are formed by projections (8) and

guide slots (9) making contact with this guide lug (11).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 at the closed end of the housing (1) 
an axial extension (2) is formed, onto which a rod can be

plugged.
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 4,

characterised in that
 an electronic control unit (12) is
provided for triggering the test light source (5) and for

evaluating the signals of the test light detector (4),
wherein on receipt of light emitted by the smoke-indicating

light source (15) a signal is generated by the test light
detector (4), which triggers a light pulse when a

predetermined value in the test light source (5) is
exceeded, and that the electronic control unit contains

blocking means for preventing the triggering of a further
light pulse of the test light source by the light pulse

emitted by the test light source itself.
Device according to Claim 6 
characterised in that
 said
blocking means produce a blocking of the output signal of

the test light detector (4) for a certain time after the
first triggering of the test light source (5).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 ventilation means are arranged in or
on the housing (1) by which an air-stream can be blown into

the smoke detector under test, and that means for heating
the air-stream are provided.
