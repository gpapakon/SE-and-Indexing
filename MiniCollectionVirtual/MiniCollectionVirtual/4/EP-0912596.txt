 PLANT PLASTID DIVISION GENESCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority from provisional patent application Serial No. 60/020,959 filed June 28, 1996.STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not applicable.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The agriculture industry has devoted considerable resources toward the development of phenotypically distinct plants with economically advantageous qualities. Valuable features in food crops include increased vigor, disease resistance, greater yields, extended shelf-life, and enhanced nutritional content .The development of high yielding food crops is particularly important. Each year, the tillable land available for agricultural production is reduced as more acreage is devoted to alternative uses. At the same time, the human population is rapidly increasing. Therefore, it is essential to increase agricultural productivity in order to meet the nutritional needs of the world's burgeoning population. Efforts to develop crop plants that produce higher yields have been directed toward pest control, or toward the selection and breeding of varieties that bear greater numbers of fruit, or that produce larger fruit. These crop breeding endeavors are very time-consuming and labor-intensive, but have historically increased crop yields incrementally over time.Modern techniques of recombinant DNA manipulation and genetic engineering offer the prospect of the more rapid creation of new plant varieties with novel traits. 

 Photosynthesis in plants is a critically important biosynthetic process upon which virtually all living organisms depend for our very existence. Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells. In the process of photosynthesis, energy in the form of light is converted to ATP, which fuels a series of enzymatic reactions that catalyze the synthesis of carbohydrates. Molecular oxygen (02) is an essential byproduct of photosynthesis. Since photosynthesis is the source of metabolic energy in plants, photosynthetic efficiency is a significant factor associated with general plant growth and vigor .It is known that photosynthetic activity is positively correlated with chloroplast number (Leech and Baker, "The development of photosynthetic capacity in leaves. In: J.E. Dale and F. L. Milthorpe (eds) , The Growth and Functioning ofLeaves. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp 271-307, 1983) . Despite the centrality of the photosynthetic function of chloroplasts to life, relatively little is known about the manner

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS I claim:
1. A transgenic plant comprising in its genome a genetic construct comprising a sense or antisense plastid division sequence and a promoter, not natively associated with the sequence, which promotes expression of the sequence in the plant, wherein expression of the sequence in the plant causes alterations in the number and size of plastids in plant cells of the plant as compared to nontransgenic plants of the species.
2. The plant of Claim 1, wherein the sequence comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID N0:l and SEQ ID NO: 3.
3. The plant of Claim 1, wherein the construct comprises in 5' to 3' order a CaMV 35S promoter, a plastid division sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID N0:1 and SEQ ID NO: 3, and an OCS terminator.
4. The plant of Claim 1, wherein the plastids are chloroplasts .
5. A DNA sequence comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO:l
6. A DNA sequence comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2
Seed of the plant of Claim 1. 

8. A plant comprising in its genome a transgene comprising a sense or antisense FtsZ gene which causes the plant to have an altered number of plastids as compared to plants of the same species without the transgene.
Seeds of the plant of Claim 8.
10. A plant as claimed in Claim 8 wherein the coding sequence of the FtsZ gene is selected from the group consisting of cpFtsZ and AtFtsZ.
11. A plant seed comprising in its genome a genetic construct comprising a sense or antisense plastid division sequence and a promoter, not natively associated with the sequence, which promotes expression of the sequence in a plant, wherein expression of the sequence in the plant causes alterations in the number and size of plastids in plant cells of the plant.
12. A genetic construct comprising a plastid division sequence in either a sense or antisense orientation and a promoter that promotes expression of the sequence in plants, the promoter not being natively associated with the plastid division sequence.
13. The genetic construct of Claim 12, wherein the chloroplast division sequence is chosen from the group consisting of SEQ ID N0:1 and SEQ ID NO: 3.
14. The genetic construct of Claim 12, wherein the promoter is the CaMV 35S promoter. 

15. The genetic construct of Claim 12, additionally comprising a kanamycin resistance marker.
16. A method for altering the number and size of plastids in plant cells of a plant comprising the steps of constructing a genetic construct comprising a plant division sequence in either a sense or antisense orientation and a promoter, not natively associated with the sequence, which promotes expression of the sequence in plants, introducing the genetic construct into a plant, selecting a plant that has received a copy of the genetic construct, and growing the plant under conditions that allow expression of the gene.
17. A DNA sequence isolated from its native genome comprising a plant FtsZ gene.
18. The DNA sequence of Claim 17 wherein the DNA sequence is SEQ ID N0:1.
19. The DNA sequence of Claim 17 wherein the DNA sequence is SEQ ID NO: 3.
