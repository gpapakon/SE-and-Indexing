<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a concentrated lubricant based on fatty amines and possibly conventional diluents or auxiliary agents or additives, which contains at least one polyamine derivative of a fatty amine and/or a salt of such an amine, the proportion of said polyamine derivatives of fatty amines amounting to 1 to 100 wt% of the entire formulation. The invention also relates to a process for producing said concentrated lubricant and its use as a chain lubricant in the foodstuffs industry, especially in automatic chain and belt lubricating installations. In addition, an aqueous lubricant solution based on fatty amines containing at least one linear polyamine derivative of a fatty amine and the use of the lubricant solution as a chain lubricant in the foodstuffs industry is disclosed.
