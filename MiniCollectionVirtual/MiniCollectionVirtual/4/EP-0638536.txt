<ABSTRACT>
A phenol is produced by reacting an aromatic compound 
with oxygen and hydrogen in the liquid phase in the presence 

of a catalyst comprising a noble metal of group VIII of the 
periodic table, which is supported on a carrier, and in the 

co-presence of a vanadium compound. The reaction is carried 
out either (i) by using as the catalyst a catalyst 

containing 0% to 0.15% by weight, based on the weight of the 
catalyst, of halogens, or (ii) further in the co-presence of 

a specific diketone compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing
phenols which are useful as a raw material for a phenol
resin, a bisphenol resin, alkyl phenols and aniline and
other compounds.Phenol is the most typical example of phenols having
a hydroxyl group in the aromatic ring, and the most typical
process for producing phenol is a cumene process. The
cumene process has problems in that it comprises many steps
such as alkylation, oxidation and decomposition, and acetone
is produced undesirably in an amount equimolar to phenol.As other processes for the production of phenol,
there are a Raschig process wherein benzene is chlorinated
to chlorobenzene which is converted to phenol, and a
toluene-oxidizing process wherein toluene is oxidized to
benzoic acid which is converted to phenol. These processes
have problems in that the apparatus is liable to corrode, an
equipment cost is high because the processes comprise many
production steps, and the processes are troublesome because
handling of a solid and a slurry is needed.With regard to polycyclic aromatic compounds having
a hydroxyl group in the aromatic ring, a process is
industrially established wherein a non-condensed ring
compound such as diphenyl or a condensed ring compound such
as naphthalene is sulfonated and the sulfonated product is
converted to phenylphenol or naphthol, respectively. This
process also has a problem such that the apparatus is liable
to corrode due to an alkali or an acid.To solve the problems arising in the above-mentioned
processes for producing aromatic compounds having a hydroxyl 
group, a process has been proposed wherein a corresponding
aromatic compound is directly oxidized to an intended
phenol. For example, a process for producing phenol which
is the most typical example of phenols has been proposed
wherein benzene is oxidized at a high temperature of
approximately 600Â°C or under mild conditions including about
room temperature. More specifically, a Drocess has been
proposed in JP-A-56-87527
in which benzene is directly oxidized to phenol in the
presence of a catalyst comprising, for example, phosphorus
oxide, zinc oxide and silver oxide, or phosphorus oxide,
titanium oxide and siver oxide, and in the co-presence of
methanol. Further, a process has been proposed in Japanese
JP-A- 61-85338 in which benzene
is reacted with oxygen to produce phenol in the presence of
a metal porphyrin, imidazole, platinum and hydrogen.In the conventional processes for directly oxidizing
an aromatic compound to produce a phenol, the conversion of
