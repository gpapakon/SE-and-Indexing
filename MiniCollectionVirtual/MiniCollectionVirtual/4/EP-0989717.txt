<ABSTRACT>
A power feed for a submarine communications system includes a plurality of power
converters (11) each of which has at least 2 step-up transformer stages (16, 18, 19,

20, 21) in which at least one of the windings (17) of at least one of the transformer
stages of at least one of the plurality of power converters (11) is wound using a high

voltage insulating wire to insulate against a high DC voltage appearing at an output
of an adjacent power converter (11). The use of high voltage insulating wire removes

the need for expensive custom built DC blocking capacitors.

<DESCRIPTION>
Power feed equipment is required to provide electrical power to the cables of
submarine communications systems. An example of a conventional power feed is
shown schematically in Figure 1. The power feed 1 is constructed using a stack of
four identical power converters 21 to 24 connected in series which together convert a
50V DC supply at the input terminals of the power feed to provide a 10kV DC power
feed voltage across the output terminals. The first power converter 21 in the stack
provides a 2.5kV DC output, but it is elevated from earth by an additional 7.5kV DC
due to the effect of the adjacent power converters 22 to 24 in the stack. The centre-tapped
transformer secondary winding 3 of the transformer 4 in the first power
converter 21 must therefore be insulated to 10kV DC from earth to prevent Corona
discharge and ultimately flash-over. Accordingly, blocking capacitors 5 and 6 are
provided in this circuit which are designed to block the high DC voltage relative to
earth and thereby insulate the secondary winding. Due to the magnitude of the DC
voltage, the required blocking capacitors are large, bulky and expensive, and are not
available as off-the-shelf components. Indeed, each capacitor typically has a
capacitance of 0.5ÂµF and a DC voltage breakdown greater than 15kV. The use of
such components is clearly undesirable.Furthermore, although typically a nominal 2.5kV DC output is produced by each
power converter the corresponding AC pulse voltage from the high voltage secondary
winding 3 is about 4kV to allow for pulse width voltage control. Accordingly,
rectifying and smoothing circuits 7 associated with each power converter must be 
designed and built using electrical components which can withstand these high AC
voltages. Again, as with the DC blocking capacitors, such components are expensive
and not generally available off-the-shelf.According to a first aspect of the present invention, a power feed for a submarine
communications system comprises a plurality of power converters connected together
in series to convert a low voltage received at an input to the power feed to a high
voltage at an output of the power feed, in which each power converter has at least two
step-up transformer stages, and wherein at least one of the windings of the or each
transformer in at least one of the transformer stages of at least one of the plurality of
power converters is wound using a high voltage insulating wire to insulate against a
DC voltage appearing at an output of an adjacent power converter.According to
