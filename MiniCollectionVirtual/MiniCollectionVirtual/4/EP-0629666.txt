 which are useful as dyes having fibre-reactive properties for producing strong, red, fast dyeings and prints on hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing material, including fibre-material, in particular wool and synthetic polyamide fibres and especially cellulose fibres such as cotton. In the formula (1): M is hydrogen or an alkali metal; R

<CLAIMS>
A monoazo compound conforming to the formula (1)


where

M
is hydrogen or an alkali metal;
R
1
is hydrogen or sulfo;
R
2
is hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, alkoxy
of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, sulfo, hydroxyl, halogen

or carboxyl;
R
3
is hydrogen, halogen, alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon
atoms or alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon atoms;
Y
is vinyl or is ethyl which contains in the
Î²-position a substituent which is eliminable with

alkali to form a vinyl group;
p
is 1 or 2;

the one -SO
3
M group is attached to the naphthalene
ring para or meta to the amino group.
A monoazo compound as claimed in claim 1, conforming
to the formula 



where M is as defined in claim 1.
A process for preparing a monoazo compound of the
formula (1) of claim 1, which comprises diazotizing

a compound of the formula (3)


where Y, R
1
, R
2
, R
3
 and p are each as defined in
claim 1, and coupling the resulting diazonium compound

with a compound of the formula (4)


where M is as defined in claim 1. 
The use of a monoazo compound of claim 1 or of a
monoazo compound prepared as claimed in claim 3 for

dyeing (including printing) hydroxyl- and/or
carboxamido-containing material, in particular fiber

material.
A process for dyeing (including printing) hydroxyl-
and/or carboxamido-containing material, in particular

fiber material, by applying a dye to the
material and fixing the dye on the material by means

of heat or with the aid of an alkaline agent or by
means of both measures, which comprises using a dye

that is a monoazo compound of claim 1 or a monoazo
compound prepared as claimed in claim 3.
