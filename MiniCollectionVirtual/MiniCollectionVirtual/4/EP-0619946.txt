<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a herbicidal 
composition for upland farming which contains as active 
ingredients a 3-substituted phenylpyrazole derivative 
represented by the general formula (I): 
(wherein R is a hydrogen atom, a C₁₋₆ alkyl group, a C₃₋₆ 
cycloalkyl group, a C₁₋₆ haloalkyl group, a C₂₋₆ alkenyl 
group or a C₂₋₆ alkynyl group, R¹ is a C₁₋₆ alkyl group, 
X¹ and X², which may be the same or different, are 
halogen atoms, and Y is an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom) 
and at least one compound selected from the group 
consisting of sulfonylurea derivatives, phenylurea 
derivatives and phenoxy fatty acid derivatives; and a 
weeding method.  
 At present, various herbicides are used for 
controlling weeds in cultivation of crops (e.g. wheat, 
barley, soybean and corn) by upland farming. The weeds 
to be controlled in the upland farming are various in 
kind and their emergence period is long. Therefore, it 
is necessary to use a herbicide which has a wide weed 
control spectrum, is harmless to the crops, and exhibits 
a marked herbicidal effect even at a low dosage. JP-A-04059706 discloses a herbicidal composition for 
agricultural use containing (A) a 3-substituted 
phenylpyrazole derivative of formula 
and (B) one or more of sulfonylurea, phenylurea and 
phenoxy fatty acid compounds. JP-A-03246204 discloses a herbicidal composition for dry 
fields comprising a 3-substituted phenylpyrazole derivative 
of formula 
and a sulfonylurea compound as active ingredients.  
 EP-A-0361114 discloses a 3-substituted phenylpyrazole 
derivative represented by the general formula 
wherein R¹, R², R³, R⁴ and X are various substituents 
and a salt thereof, and its production process. Said 
pyrazole derivative or its salt is useful as a herbicide 
for controlling various injurious weeds. The present 
inventors earnestly investigated in order to develop a 
herbicide which has a wide weed control spectrum, 
prevents the emergence of weeds for a long period of 
time, is harmless to crops, and exhibits a herbicidal 
effect even at a low dosage. Consequently, the present 
inventors found that the combination of 3-substituted 
phenylpyrazole derivative of the above general formula 
(I) and at least one compound selected from the group 
consisting of sulfonylurea derivatives, phenylurea 
derivatives and phenoxy fatty acid derivatives brings 
about a synergistic effect unexpectedly larger than that 
obtained by using each of the derivative and the 
compounds alone, and hence permits reduction of the 
dosage and expansion of
