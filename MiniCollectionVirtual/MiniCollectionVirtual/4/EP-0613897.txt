<ABSTRACT>
A piperadine derivative of formula (1): 

a salt thereof and a drug containing the derivative as an 
effective component. 
This compound has excellent antihistamine activity 
and antileukotriene activity, which are well balanced, and 

thus they are useful for the prevention and treatment of 
asthma or other allergic diseases such as allergic 

rhinitis, allergic dermatosis and urticaria.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a piperidine 
derivative or a salt thereof, which has excellent 
antihistamine activity and antileukotriene activity, and 
is useful as a drug for the prevention and treatment of 
various allergic diseases. Histamine produces various complex biological actions 
via interaction with specific receptors in the membranes 
of cell surfaces. Action of histamine on H1-receptors 
stimulates many smooth muscles to contract such as those 
in the bronchi. Contraction of the bronchi leads to 
restriction of the air passage into and out of the lungs 
as in asthma. Histamine also increases the permeability 
of the capillary walls so that more of the constituents of 
the plasma can escape into the tissue spaces, leading to 
an increase in the flow of lymph and its protein content, 
and formation of edema. Histamine H1-receptor antagonists 
have been proven to be successful for the treatment of 
many allergic diseases, e.g., allergic rhinitis, 
dermatosis, urticaria, etc. However for the treatment of  
 
some severe allergic diseases such as asthma, histamine 
H1-receptor antagonists have been found to be less 
effective. Leukotrienes are a group of arachidonic acid 
metabolites,which are collectively long-known 'slow-reacting 
substance of anaphylaxis' (SRS-A). The 
biological action of leukotrienes include 
bronchoconstriction, mucus hypersecretion and pulmonary 
edema which all contribute to airway obstruction 
characteristic of asthma. Leukotrienes also possess 
chemotactic properties that attract leukocyte to sites 
chemotactic properties that attract leukocyte to sites 
of cellular injury and thus contribute to inflammation. 
In contrast to histamine, leukotrienes induce prolonged 
bronchoconstriction. Clinical trials of the compounds 
known to have capability to block leuokotriene 
D4 (LTD4) action on its receptors have shown that these 
compounds are effective for the treatment of asthma 
(Manning, P.J. et al: N. Engl. J. Med. 1990, 323, 1736-1739 
and Taylor, I.K. et al: Lancer 1991, 337, 690-694). Accordingly, compounds with antagonistic activity on 
both histamine H1-receptors and leukotriene LTD4-receptors 
are potentially useful therapeutics for the prevention and 
treatment of allergic diseases in general and asthma in 
particular. Many piperidine derivatives have been reported to 
exhibit both antihistamine activity and antileukotriene 
activity (Foxwell, M.H. et al: J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 
1988, 81, 250; European patent publication No. 0399414A1; 
Japanese patent
