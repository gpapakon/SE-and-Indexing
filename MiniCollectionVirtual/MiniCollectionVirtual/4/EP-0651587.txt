<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for inter-cell transfer between two cells, called old and new cells, for a cellular mobile radio communications system using the TDMA principle, according to which method communication between a mobile station and the system, initially set up, in connection with the old cell, on a first channel defined by a first time interval on the air and a first set of frequencies comprising at least one frequency, is transferred so as to be carried out, in connection with the new cell, on a second channel, defined by a second time interval on the air and a second set of sequences comprising at least one frequency, characterised in that the first and second time intervals on the air are identical, in that the first and second sets of frequencies are different from one another, and in that the method consists in transmitting, after having verified that the second time interval identical to the first time interval is available within the new cell, a message called frequency indication message indicating the second set of frequencies to the mobile station, so that the latter carries on the communication by using the same time interval and the second set of frequencies.
