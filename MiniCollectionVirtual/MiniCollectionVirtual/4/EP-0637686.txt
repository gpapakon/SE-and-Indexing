<ABSTRACT>
A fuel injection nozzle for internal combustion engines has a nozzle body (11), fixed on a nozzle holder (14) with the insertion of an intermediate washer, and a valve needle (15) axially displaceable in the said body, which needle is raised from a valve seat (16) by the fuel pressure against a closing spring arrangement (31, 33; 51) for the injection of fuel. In order to give the injection nozzle a slender shape, the chamber in the nozzle holder accommodating the closing spring arrangement is arranged eccentrically in relation to the nozzle axis and the fuel feed duct (22) in the thicker wall part of the nozzle holder thereby produced. In order moreover to transmit the closing force of the closing spring arrangement to the valve needle as far as possible without any lateral forces, a pressure stud (37, 53, 63) transmitting the closing force is guided in a through hole (40) running eccentrically to the nozzle axis (b). The stud is integrally connected to a thrust piece (37) or to the valve needle (15).

Fuel injection nozzle for an internal combustion
engine, in particular for a direct-injection diesel

internal combustion engine, with a nozzle body (11), in
which a valve needle (15), cooperating with a valve seat

(16) and loaded in the closing direction by a helical
compression spring (31, 32) and in the opening direction

by the fuel pressure, is guided displaceably in the
longitudinal axis (b) of the nozzle body (11), with a

nozzle holder (14) which is connected coaxially to the
nozzle body (11) and in which are arranged, offset

axially to the longitudinal axis (b) of the nozzle body
(11), a cylindrical spring chamber (28, 29) open towards

the nozzle body (11) and, in the said spring chamber, the
closing spring (31, 32) as well as, parallel thereto, a

fuel inflow duct (22) in the thicker wall part of the
nozzle holder (14), the said wall part resulting from the

eccentricity of the spring chamber (28, 29), and with an
intermediate disc (12) which is clamped coaxially and

sealingly between the nozzle body (11) and the nozzle
holder (14) and on which the valve needle (15) butts with

an abutment face (44) at the maximum stroke and which has
a perforation (40, 55, 65) for a stud (38, 33, 63), via

the free end face (39, 54, 66) of which the closing force
of the helical compression spring (31, 32) is transmitted

to the valve needle (15), characterized in that the
perforation (40, 55, 65) and the stud (38, 53, 63) are

arranged in the intermediate disc (12) so as to be
axially offset to the longitudinal axis (b) of the nozzle

body (11) and of the valve needle (15) and essentially 
coaxial to the axis (c) of the closing spring (31, 32;

46, 47; 51).
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the end face (39, 54, 64) of the

stud (38, 53, 63) receives with part of its outer edge
region the longitudinal axis (b) of the nozzle body (11).
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the stud (38, 53) is connected

integrally to a pressure member (37) and is guided
displaceably in the perforation (40, 55) in the intermediate

disc (12).
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 3,
characterized in that the pressure member (37) on the

stud (38) has a head (41) and is arranged in the correspondingly
designed perforation (40) of the intermediate

disc (12).
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the stud (63) is connected

integrally to the valve needle (15) so as to leave an
abutment shoulder (67) .
Fuel injection nozzle according to Claim 5,
characterized in that the stud (63) is formed by lateral

erosion on the valve needle (15).
Fuel injection nozzle according to one of Claims
1 to 6, characterized in that the nozzle holder (14) has

arranged in it two closing springs (31, 32; 46, 47)
which, during the stroke of the valve needle (15), act in

succession on the valve needle (15) via the pressure
member (37) .
