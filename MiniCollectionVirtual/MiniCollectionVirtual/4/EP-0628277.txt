<ABSTRACT>
A food-warming arrangement for maintaining the food at a desired 
temperature for consuming, in a food-delivery motorized vehicle 

(1) having a box (3) for carrying 
the food and an engine cooling system (4), the arrangement comprising 

an isolating case (10) with 
a heat exchanger (24) therein, the hot coolant coming from the engine is 

circulated trough the 
heat exchanger (24) by a food-heating circuit and at least one fan (25) 

is provided to remove heat 
from the heat exchanger (24) and spread it within the case so as to be 

capable of keeping a 
desired temperature within the case, the food-heating circuit being 

connected to the engine cooling system (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the maintenance of food and meals in warm 
conditions for consuming purposes, and particularly refers to a food-warming arrangement 
for keeping the food at a desired temperature in a food-delivering motorized vehicle, the 
arrangement taking profit of the heat contained in the coolant circulating within a cooling 
system of an engine of the vehicle. It is well known for any person that an internal combustion engine generates 
high temperatures as a result of the explosion of the fuel within the combustion chamber. 
To keep the temperatures at reasonable levels in the engine block, it is neccessary to 
remove part of such a heat which removal is made by circulating a coolant through a 
cooling system generally comprising a cooling circuit, a heat exchanger, and pumping 
means for circulating the coolant through the circuit and the exchanger. Part of the cooling 
circuit is formed within the engine block for removing heat therefrom, particularly from an 
upper portion thereof where the cylinders are located. A part of this energy in the form of heat is conveyed in the exhaust gas and 
exhausted through the exhaust pipe and another part, the most important one, is conveyed 
in the coolant, generally cooling water, and lost into the environment through the heat 
exchanger. In all circumstances the heat is lost and no saving thereof is made. Few attempts to save the heat energy have been done, for example by taking 
profit thereof in a heater for heating the car cockpit. Another application to save the heat  
 
energy has been the fact of preheating the fuel at the inlet to the carburetor by taking heat 
either from the cooling water or from the exhaust combustion gas. No application has been 
made, however, of the engine cooling system in a heating arrangement for heating the 
goods which are carried in a motorized vehicle, perticularly food or meals which are being 
delivered for immediate consuming purposes. It is an object of the invention to save the energy in the form of heat usually 
lost from a combustion engine of a vehicle and take profit of it by means of a food-warming 
arrangement for maintaining food at a desired temperature, for consuming or 
eating purposes, in a box of a food-delivering motorized vehicle such as the body of a car, 
truck or wagon. It is another object of the present invention to provide a food-warming 
arrangement for keeping the food such as any kind of meals, pizza, and the like at a 
desired temperature in a food-delivering motorized

<CLAIMS>
A food-warming arrangement for keeping the food at a desired temperature 
in a food-delivering motorized vehicle, by taking profit of the heat generated by 

combustion engine means of the vehicle, the vehicle having a food-carrying box and an 
engine-cooling system comprising a cooling circuit containing a coolant, at least one heat 

exchanger, and pumping means for circulating the coolant through the circuit and through 
the exchanger, the arrangement comprising: 

   at least one isolating case defining an isolating warm chamber with supporting 
means within thereof for accommodating the food; 

   heat exchanging means within said case; 
   fan means adjacent said heat exchanging means for removing heat from the 

heat exchanging means and spreading the heat within the chamber, for keeping said 
desired temperature in the chamber; 

   a food heating circuit for circulating said coolant from a hot-coolant outlet of 
the engine means, through the heat exchanging means within the case and back into the 

engine cooling system upstream a coolant inlet in the engine means. 
The food-warming arrangement of claim 1, wherein control means are 
provided for turning off the fan means upon the temperature in the heat exchanging means 

reaches a predetermined threshold above said desired temperature. 
The food-warming arrangement of claim 2, wherein the case comprises a 
frame and walls fixed thereto, the walls defining the isolating warm chamber, each wall 

comprising, from outside to inside the case, an outer plate, an air chamber and a plastic 
isolating foam fixed to an inner plate. 
The food-warming arrangement of claim 3, wherein the supporting means 
comprise a plurality of guiding L- profile bars for supporting food trays, the bars being 

fixed to the frame. 
The food-warming arrangement of claim 3, wherein the case has at least one 
door defining an access to the warm chamber, the door having wheather strips to keep the 

chamber isolated when closed. 
The food-warming arrangement of claim 1, wherein the heat exchanging 
means comprise a heat radiator. 
The food warming arrangement of claim 1, wherein the case comprises a 
heating-means-carrying compartment adjacent said warm chamber and separated thereof 

by a foraminous plate extending across the case. 
The food warming arrangement of claim 6, wherein the heat radiator has an 
inlet and an outlet, the inlet being connected to the coolant outlet of the engine means and 

the radiator outlet supplies the coolant to an inlet of the engine heat exchanger, the engine 
heat exchanger having a cold-coolant outlet connected to a coolant inlet in said engine 

means.
