Two axis rate gyroscope (30) with two articulated parts (10, 11, 
50, 51) arranged axially behind each other, of which the first 

articulated part (10, 50) is connected to a driveshaft (33) of the 
gyroscope (30), and the second articulated part (11, 51) is 

connected to a gyro rotor (34), and both articulated parts (10, 
11, 50, 51) are joined by two narrow webs (12) arranged at the 

side of a centre bore (14) and vertically to the centre axis of the 
articulated parts (10, 11, 50, 51) and tensioned towards each 

other by means of spring elements (21, 22, 52) which act on 
pretensioned load measuring elements (17, 54), and the spring 

elements (21, 22, 52) elastically deform symmetrically around 
the webs (12) under the effect of a sinusoidally changing torque, 

and the load measuring elements (17, 54) are alternatedly 
loaded and unloaded and produce proportional measuring 

signals to correspond with the effective loads. 
Gyroscope according to Claim 1, with the articulated parts (10, 
11, 50, 51) being round and provided with two diametrical spring 

elements (21, 22, 52) and load measuring elements (17, 54). 
Gyroscope according to one of Claims 1 or 2, with spring 
elements composed of cup springs (21). 
Gyroscope according to one of Claims 1 or 2, with spring 
elements composed of pressure springs (22). 
Gyroscope according to one of Claims 1 or 2, with spring 
elements composed of expansion bolts (52). 
Gyroscope according to one of Claims 1 or 2, with load 
measuring elements composed of quartzes (17, 54). 
Gyroscope according to one of Claims 1 or 2, with load 
measuring elements composed of piezo ceramics (17, 54). 
Gyroscope according to one of Claims 2 or 3, with cup springs 
(21) or pressure springs (22) as well as the load measuring 

elements (17, 54) arranged one behind the other in bores (15, 
15a, 16, 16a) of both articulated parts (10, 11), and the cup  

 
springs (21) or pressure springs (22) are mounted in the first 

articulated part (10) and the load measuring elements (17, 54) 
are mounted between the articulated parts (10, 11) in the area 

of slots (13) located between the articulated parts (10, 11). 
Gyroscope according to Claim 5, with expansion bolts (52) 
seated with their heads (52a) in the second articulated part (51) 

and their shafts (52b) passed through the first articulated part 
(50), and the load measuring elements (17, 54) are arranged 

externally on the shafts (52b) and abut under pretension with 
nuts (55) against the first articulated part (50). 
Gyroscope according to Claim 9, with two load measuring 
elements (54). which are electrically connected by a contact 

plate (53) and switched in parallel, are seated on the expansion 
bolts (52), and the contact plates (52) are connected by means 

of conductors (19) to a slip ring transmitter (3). 
Gyroscope according to one of Claims 1 to 10, with soldering 
points (18) applied externally on the load measuring elements 

(17, 54) which connect the load measuring elements (17, 54) 
and a slip ring transmitter (38) by means of conductors (19). 
Gyroscope according to Claim 1, with an angle reference signal 
for a downstream evaluation electronics being generated by 

means of an pulse disc (39), which is provided with a slot (40), 
and a light barrier (41).
