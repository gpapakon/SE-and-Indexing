<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed for mechanically and electrically 
bonding metallic materials and semiconductor materials. The 

method according to the invention may be used, for example, in 
forming a semiconductor electrical heater, particularly for use in 

electrical smoking articles. A metallic element 2, such as a 
copper alloy power supply tab, is laser welded to a semiconductor 

element 1, such as a doped silicon resistive heater element. A 
laser beam L is directed through a hole 3 in the copper alloy tab 

to melt some silicon material 5, which flows into the hole in the 
copper tab, reacts and intermixes with the copper and solidifies 

to form a slug containing copper silicide. A protective material 
such as nickel may be applied to protect the copper silicide from 

oxidation if desired. An ohmic, low resistance contact and high 
strength bond is provided between the parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for
bonding a metallic element to a semiconductor
element, and to a semiconductor electrical
heater. More particularly, the invention relates to an electrical smoking article
comprising a semiconductor electrical heater.It has been shown that semiconductor material, such as
silicon doped with impurities, can be used to form resistive
heating elements having a relatively large, preselectable,
electrical resistivity. Such heating elements can be used in
compact, lightweight heaters that can be repeatedly cycled from
room temperature to temperatures in excess of 800Â°C without
substantial thermal degradation or changes in operating
characteristics.EP-A-0 615 411, which forms part of the state of the art
only by virtue of Article 54(3) EPC, discloses an electrically
heated smoking article 
in which electrical power is applied to several heater elements
of the type described above through respective ohmic contacts.
The ohmic contacts must have a low electrical resistance in
order to concentrate the generation of heat in the bulk of the
semiconductor material and thereby avoid excess power
consumption and thermal degradation of the contact area.
Furthermore, the contacts must be mechanically and chemically
robust in order to withstand thermal stresses and oxidation
caused by repeated heating cycles, and mechanical stresses
caused during use by the mechanical contact of tobacco smoking
material against the heating elements. Ideally, the contacts
should be easy and inexpensive to make.In electrically heated smoking articles of this type,
(a) mechanical clips that clamp against ohmic contact pads,(b) metallic leads bonded to ohmic contacts or (c)metallic
"tabs" that make direct ohmic contact with the semiconductor
heating element can be employed in order to apply power from a
metallic conductor through the ohmic contacts.The present invention relates to an improved method for
providing metallic "tabs" that make direct ohmic contact with a
semiconductor element. The method can be used in forming a
semiconductor electrical heater for use in an electrical
smoking article. In view of the above background, it has been desired to
form a low-resistance ohmic contact directly between a metallic
element and a semiconductor element;
to provide a mechanically and chemically robust bond
between a metallic element and a semiconductor element that
withstands mechanical stresses that can be caused by physical
contact with the semiconductor element during use and that
withstands repeated
