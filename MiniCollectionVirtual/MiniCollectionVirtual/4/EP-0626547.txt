<ABSTRACT>
Process for the production of liquid steel, according to which melting of ferrous substances rich in carbonaceous substances is carried out so as to obtain a carbide-containing liquid metal and then decarbonisation of the said liquid metal is carried out so as to convert it into liquid steel, characterised in that melting of the said ferrous substances is carried out in a first vessel (1) of an electrical furnace, a pretreatment of the said carbide-containing liquid metal thus obtained is then carried out in a separate pretreatment plant, and, finally, decarbonisation of the said carbide-containing liquid metal is carried out in a second vessel (10) of an electrical furnace. Another subject of the invention is a plant for the production of liquid steel for making use of this process. The first and second vessels preferably consist of the two vessels of a double-vessel electrical furnace with single electrical supply.

<CLAIMS>
Process for producing liquid steel, in which
process ferrous materials consisting of prereduced ores

containing more than 4% carbon and more than 0.06%
sulphur are melted so as to obtain a carburized liquid

metal and then the said liquid metal is decarburized so
as to convert it into liquid steel, characterized in

that the said ferrous materials are melted in a first
vessel of an electric furnace, then the carburized

liquid metal thus obtained undergoes a pretreatment in
a separate pretreatment plant and finally, the said

carburized liquid metal is decarburized in a second
vessel of an electric furnace, the said pretreatment of

the liquid metal comprising desulphurization of the
said metal.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, before and/or during the said decarburization,

ferrous materials having a low sulphur content are
added to the said second vessel.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the said ferrous materials having a low sulphur

content consist of prereduced iron ore that has been
depleted beforehand of carbonaceous matter.
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the said prereduced iron ore has been depleted of

carbonaceous matter by magnetic separation.
Process according to Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the said first and second vessels 

consist of the two vessels of a twin-vessel electric
arc furnace with a single electrical supply.
