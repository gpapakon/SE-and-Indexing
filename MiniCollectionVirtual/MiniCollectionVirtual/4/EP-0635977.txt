<ABSTRACT>
High definition television coder/decoder a high definition coder 
or decoder includes a number of parallel sub-decoders or coders. 

The image to be coded or decoded is divided into a number of 
stripes, a given stripe being coded or decoded by a single sub-coder 

or sub-decoder. Every Nth stripe is coded or decoded by the 
same sub-coder/sub-decoder, where N is the number of sub-coders 

or sub-decoders. The number of sub-coders is independent of the 
number of sub-decoders whereby a reduction in the number of sub-coders 

with increasing bit-rate capacity does not necessitate a 
change in decoder.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to high definition television (HDTV) and in particular to the
synchronisation of receiver and transmitter decoders and coders.There has been proposed an HDTV coder/decoder (usually referred to as a codec) which
consists of six parallel conventional definition (CDTV) bit-rate reduction codecs in parallel
(i.e. six sub-codecs). Each codec operates on an appropriate block of picture area and the
HDTV codec can operate at 140 Mbit/S. Although this proposal is attractive, it has the
disadvantage that if it were to be adopted as a standard, any future implementation would
have to consist of six parallel codecs. This standard may not be efficient when the speed of
single codecs is increased to the point where an HDTV codec could be implemented with
fewer parallel paths.US-A-4 675 722 discloses the synchronisation of a video signal decoder in which during
a C-MAC coding process a timing reference signal is inserted in the signal for
transmission to the decoder.A coder/decoder which overcomes the problem is claimed in our co-pending patent
application EP 91902131.1 (published as EP-A-0 464 166 on 08 January 1992) to which reference is directed.According to the present invention there is provided a method of synchronising a video signal
decoder having a decoder buffer, comprising the steps of coding a digital video signal for
transmission in a coder having a coder buffer, generating an explicit timing reference signal,
inserting the timing reference signal into the coded video signal after the coder buffer and prior
to transmission, transmitting the video signal including the timing reference signal, receiving
the video signal at a receiver, detecting the timing reference signal in the received coded video
signal before the decoder buffer, and setting a decoder time base in accordance with the
detected reference signal.The invention also provides a video signal receiver comprising means for receiving a
transmitted coded digital video signal including an timing reference signal, a decoder
for decoding the coded video signal including a decoder buffer, means for detecting the timing
reference signal in the received video signal before the decoder buffer, means for setting the
time base of the decoder in accordance with the detected timing reference signal, and means
for displaying the decoded video signal.  The invention further provides a receiver wherein the means for detecting the timing reference
signal in the received video signal comprises means for stripping a time reference from the
vi
