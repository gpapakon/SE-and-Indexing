<ABSTRACT>
In order to avoid ergonomic problems such as carpel tunnel syndrome 
while improving productivity, an apparatus for feeding signatures to a 

patent bound 
binding line is disclosed. The apparatus includes a pocket (16) adjacent 

a binding line for 
receiving signatures to be delivered to the binding line (14). It also 

includes a signature 
feeder (18,20) for feeding signatures from a source in a generally 

vertical direction to a 
signature receiving and transferring mechanism (22). The signature 

receiving and 
transferring mechanism has a signature receiving end positioned in 

generally vertically 
spaced relation to the source and a signature transferring end 

positioned generally 
adjacent to the pocket. The signature receiving and transferring 

mechanism has a 
signature conveyor (24) for conveying signatures in a continuous stream 

from the signature 
receiving end to the signature transferring end for delivery into the 

pocket. There 
also is provided a signature invertor for inverting the signatures from 

a first up 
position to a first down position as the signatures are being conveyed 

to the pocket. 
Advantageously, the signature invertor includes a double belt having a 

twist which 
is carried on sets of rollers each at an angle to the next in order to 

invert the 
signatures during travel from the signature feeder to the pocket.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to a signature feeder and, 
more particularly, an apparatus for feeding signatures to a binding line. In recent years, many large circulation periodicals have appeared which 
require rapid handling of portions of the periodicals consisting of signatures which 
are gathered for binding, trimmed, bundled for minimum shipping costs, and shipped. 
A typical operation utilizes a multitude of inserter pockets, each of which receives 
signatures seriatim from a signature supply means and causes the signatures to be 
positioned on a binding line, whether of the saddlewire type or a patent bound line, 
which runs in front of the inserter pockets and carries the complete collection of 
gathered signatures to a location for further processing to complete the binding 
process. Moreover, because of the need for highly efficient plant operations, there 
has been a constant effort to increase the speed at which machines operate which has 
required the development of new techniques for handling the signatures at all stages 
of the binding process. In addition to high speed operation, it will be appreciated that any 
apparatus necessarily has to be compatible with the limit on the space that is available 
in a binding line facility. In development of the present invention, it was established 
as a goal for the signature feeding apparatus to address the concerns in terms of 
ergonomic problems such as carpel tunnel syndrome and the like. This was 
successfully addressed in commonly owned U.S. Patent No. 5,114,129 of Chang et 
al. which issued on May 19, 1992 for: "Signature Feeding Apparatus" and which 
was directed to saddlewire binding lines. In the case of the present invention, it was 
recognized as important to also be able to rotate a signature stream from a first up 
position to a first down position while hopefully at the same time increasing capacity 
for stacked signatures within the same or a similar amount of floor space as 
conventional inserter pockets in a manner accommodating signatures in a variety of 
different widths. Still additionally, it was also important for any such apparatus was  
 
to be capable of operation at high speed so as to fully satisfy the demand for such a 
device for patent bound binding lines. The present invention is thus directed to overcoming the foregoing 
problems and achieving the resulting objects as established by the development of the 
unique signature feeding apparatus described herein. It is a principal object of the present
