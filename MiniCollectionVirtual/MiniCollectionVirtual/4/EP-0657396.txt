<ABSTRACT>
Process for the manufacture of continuous glass filaments. The process consists in depositing on the glass filaments being drawn a size consisting of a solution whose solvent content is lower than 5 % by weight, the said solution including a mixture of components that are polymerisable and/or crosslinkable by heat treatment, the said components being, in the case of at least 60 % by weight thereof, components whose molecular mass is lower than 750, less than 10 % by weight of film-forming agents and from 0 to 25 % by weight of bridging agents, lubricating agents, stabilising agents and initiators and/or catalysts, the said agents being optionally polymerisable and/or crosslinkable by heat treatment, in reeling the filament(s) formed by bringing together the said filaments onto a rotating support to form a winding consisting of turns of filament coated with an unpolymerised size. The filaments are intended for the reinforcement of thermoplastic or heat-curable organic substances or of substances of inorganic origin.

Process for manufacturing glass
fibres consisting in mechanically drawing a large

number of continuous filaments from thin streams of
molten glass flowing from a large number of

apertures provided in the base of a die plate, then
in collecting the previously sized filaments to form

one or more fibres which is/are collected on a
support, according to which process there is

deposited on the surface of the filaments in the
process of being drawn a size consisting of a

mixture of which the solvent content is zero or less
than 5 weight %, the solution comprising a mixture

of constituents which can be polymerized and/or
crosslinked by heat treatment, at least 60 weight %

of the constituents being constituents of which the
molecular weight is less than 750, possibly less

than 10 weight % being film-forming agents and 0 to
25 weight % being coupling agents, lubricants,

stabilizers and initiators and/or catalysts for
polymerization by heat treatment, it being possible

if necessary for the agents and initiators to be
polymerized and/or crosslinked by heat treatment,

the viscosity of said solution being equal to or
less than approximately 400 cP, the process then 

consisting in winding the fibre or fibres, formed by
the collection of the filaments, on a rotating

support so as to form a wound package consisting of
turns of fibre coated with a non-polymerized size,

the amount of size deposited being less than 5
weight % of the total weight of the wound package.
Process according to Claim 1,
characterized in that at least 60 weight % of the

mixture of constituents which can be polymerized
and/or crosslinked is formed of constituents of

which the molecular weight is less than
approximately 500.
Process according to either of Claims
1 and 2, characterized in that the constituents

forming at least 60 weight % of the mixture are
monomers.
Process according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that a size

comprising at least 70 weight % of constituents
which can be polymerized and/or crosslinked is

deposited on the filaments. 
Process according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the size

deposited on the filaments comprises between 75 and
100 weight % of constituents which can be

polymerized and/or crosslinked.
Process according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that a size

depleted of solvent is deposited on the filaments.
Process according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the size

deposited on the filaments can comprise up to 5
weight % of film-forming agents selected from the

derivatives of silicones and/or siloxanes.
Process according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the size

deposited on the filaments can comprise up to 15
weight % of coupling agents in the form of

organosilanes.
Process according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the size

deposited on the filaments can comprise up to 8 
weight % of lubricants such as fatty esters or

glycol esters.
Process according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the size

deposited on the filaments can comprise up to 4
weight % of polymerization catalysts
 and/or
initiators.
Process according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the size

deposited on the filaments can comprise up to 3
weight % of stabilizers.
Process according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the wound

package is formed by observing an angle of
intersection of at least 1.5°.
Process according to Claim 12,
characterized in that the wound package thus

produced is subjected to a heat treatment so as to
cause the size to polymerize.
Wound package produced according to
any one of Claims 1 to 13, characterized in that it 

is formed of turns of glass fibre of which the
melting loss is less than 5 weight %.
Wound package according to Claim 14,
characterized in that it is formed of turns of glass

fibre coated with a polymerized size.
Wound package according to either of
Claims 14 and 15, characterized in that it is formed

of turns of glass fibre consisting of filaments of
