<ABSTRACT>
Especially for use in disinfecting water by bubbling 
in a gas such as ozone, novel apparatus comprises an inlet 

(1) and an outlet (2) for liquid and which defines a flow 

path therebetween, the path including, in succession, a 
downward flow zone (5) and an upward flow zone (6), the 

zones being separated by a wall (8) beneath which there is 
a gap (12) for the flow between the zones, wherein the 

upward flow zone includes a perforate baffle (14), adjacent 
to the gap, such that there is substantially laminar flow 

throughout that zone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for improving flow 
conditions in a tank, and to apparatus adapted for such 
improvement. Many systems are known, which involve gas/liquid 
contact, e.g. for the aerobic digestion of biomass, using 
oxygen or air, and for the disinfection of water, using 
chlorine or, increasingly, ozone. These systems are 
generally based on the principle of introducing bubbles of 
the gas into the liquid, e.g. in counter-current, with a 
view to maximising the degree of contact between the active 
gas and the liquid. A known water disinfection tank comprises an inlet and 
an outlet for liquid and defines a flow path including, in 
succession, a downward flow or diffuser zone including a 
gas bubble inlet (e.g. for chlorine or ozone gas) and an 
upward flow or decay zone, the zones being separated by a 
wall beneath which there is a gap for the flow between 
these zones. The final decay zone is a relatively large 
chamber, in which it is intended that all residual 
disinfectant should stay in contact with the liquid for a 
specified time, before passing to the outlet of the 
apparatus. Prolonged contact is necessary, in order 
effectively to kill organisms such as Giardia. It has now been discovered that the efficiency of such 
apparatus can be improved, with consequent savings in the 
cost of expensive materials such as ozone, if the apparatus 
is modified by introducing a perforate baffle into the 
decay zone. In particular, it has been found that the final decay 
chamber in a water disinfection tank is usually dominated 
by a large recirculating flow. The chamber is therefore 
not fully utilised, and indeed there may be the quite 
unsatisfactory combination of liquid circulating for an  
 
extended period in the chamber while other liquid and ozone 
or other disinfectant pass almost immediately to the 
outlet. This problem is overcome by the use of a perforate 
baffle, that ensures substantially laminar flow throughout 
the chamber. The invention will now be described by way of example 
only with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:

embodying the invention more particularly described in our 
copending European Patent Application No.          ,

Apparatus for Gas/Liquid Contact"; and Fig. 2 shows schematically liquid flow vectors between 
an inlet at the bottom left and an outlet at the top right,
