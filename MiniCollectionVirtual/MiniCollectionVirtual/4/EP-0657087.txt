<ABSTRACT>
Cooking ranges using heating by eddy currents caused by induction of high frequency energy are known, but they have losses caused by leakage fields. The invention provides heating unit in which the magnet coils are integrated into magnetic circuit where the field is collected due to the disposition of the core. A preferred embodiment utilizes magnetic concrete for core parts (9, 11a,b,c) with chambers (10a,b,c) for the coils. There may advantageously be cast a covering layer (16) which is thin and wear resistant but still strong, because it is everywhere supported by the material (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
 AN APPARATUS FOR HEATING OF VESSELS FOR PREPARATION OF FOODThe invention concerns an apparatus for the heating of cooking vessels for food by means of high frequency energy, also termed an induction heating cooker. For heating and cooking of food in pots and frying on pans many different heat sources are used, e.g. burning gas, incandescent spirals which may be built into steel plates or give off heat radiation, comprising halogen lamps, the light radiation of which is reflected from below against the bottom of the cooking pot. It is desired to have a source of heat which may be regulated as quickly as possible in order to obtain the most direct influence on the heating of the content in function of the instantaneous energy supply. It has become common to supply the top of a hotplate or an assembly of hotplates with a coating which will endure the sliding of pots along its surface as well as resisting strong cleansing agents and consequently heat resistant glass is often used. The strong cleansing agents are necessary because a large part of the surface of an assembly becomes so hot that spilt food burns on easily. Furthermore it is essential that the sheet of glass has a considerable thickness because it must resist the sudden placement of heavy pots on the hotplate. The glass plate itself is carried by heavy brackets.It has become usual to require that a unit for heating food shall have a low profile and a low temperature on the outside of the enclosure because the cooking range and oven are installed independently of each other and are built-in in separate locations. Furthermore it has become more and more common to use electronics for control of power and such electronic components are not durable at too elevated temperatures. For industrial use induction heating is known in which the primary of a transformer is supplied with high frequency energy from a generator or transmitter and 

where the secondary wholly or in part consists of metal in a crucible. Since the content of the crucible is almost solid most of the high frequency energy will be dispersed as current losses by the eddy currents generated in the contents of the crucible which cannot run whithout the generation of heat because of the resistivity of the material. The penetration depth in the crucible is a.o. dependent on the frequency. When the term high frequency energy is used in this text it means energy transmitted at a frequency which exceeds ordinary power frequencies, in particular ultrasonic frequencies, i.e. above 20 kHz,
