<ABSTRACT>
A condylar replacement knee prosthesis has a tibial 
platform (1) adapted for attachment to a resected tibia, a 

femoral component adapted for attachment to a resected 
femur and a plastics meniscal component (20) interposed between 

the femoral and tibial components. The upper surface of 
the meniscal component (20) is shaped to correspond with 

bearing surfaces of the femoral component. The meniscal 
component (20) is guided for sliding movement in an anterior-posterior 

direction on the tibial component and for 
limited rotational movement, the rotational movement being 

centred about an axis which is displaced medially from the 
anterior-posterior centre line of the tibial component.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to prostheses for knee
replacement, particularly those for total knee replacement
operations.Most of the knee replacement prostheses in common use
are of the condylar replacement type where the arthritic
joint surfaces are resected and replaced with cooperating
metal and plastic surfaces. In designing a satisfactory
prosthesis, the aim is to replicate as far as possible the
natural movements of the knee. However, the knee is a
complex joint and the transverse axis of pivoting moves
backwards and forwards as the knee pivots. There is
also a limited degree of axial rotation; such rotation
being biassed to the medial side of the knee. One of the
difficulties, however, in providing freedom of movement to
allow such motion is to ensure, at the same time, that the
artificial joint does not jam or dislocate in use.The features
of the preamble of Claim 1 are known from the document EP-A-0519872.The present invention provides a number of different
approaches to the solution to the above problem.
According to the present invention, there is
provided a prosthesis for knee replacement which
comprises:-
(a) a femoral component having a pair of condylar
bearing surfaces and a patella bearing surface;(b) a tibial component having a tibial platform; (c) a meniscal component located between the
condylar bearing surfaces and the tibial platform; and(d) guide means arranged to guide the meniscal
component for movement in an arc about an axis medially
displaced from a centre line (PQ)
which extends substantially at right angles to the surface
of the tibial platform.The prostheses of this invention are of the condylar
replacement type. In prostheses of this type, some or
all of the natural collateral and cruciate ligaments are
retained to give stability to the artificial joint.
Often, because of the difficulty in resecting the natural
joint surfaces without damaging the cruciate ligaments, it
is the practice to resect at least the posterior cruciate
ligament. However, the collateral ligaments are
generally retained.Preferably, the guide means comprises a curved track
which is upstanding on the tibial platform and cooperates
with a recess in the meniscal component.The tibial platform may include a stud extending
upwardly from the tibial platform, which engages in a slot
in the meniscal component. Preferably, such stud has a
head which is larger than the cross section of the stud
and engages in a corresponding groove in the meniscal
component, thereby restraining lifting off of the meniscal
component

<CLAIMS>
A prosthesis for knee replacement which comprises:-

(a) a femoral component (141) having a pair of condylar bearing surfaces
(146) and a patella bearing surface (144);
(b) a tibial component (150) having a tibial platform (41);
(c) a meniscal component (44,142) located between the condylar bearing
surfaces and the tibial platform; characterised by
(d) guide means arranged to guide the meniscal component for movement
in an arc about an axis medially displaced from a centre line (PQ) which extends

substantially at right angles to the surface of the tibial platform.
A prosthesis according to claim 1 wherein the guide means comprises a
curved track (9,10) on the tibial platform which co-operates with a recess (26,27) in

the meniscal component.
A prosthesis according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the tibial platform
includes a stud (5,42) which engages in a slot (21,45) in the meniscal component.
A prosthesis according to claim 3 wherein the stud includes a head
which engages in a corresponding groove in the meniscal component and restrains

fitting off of the meniscal component from the tibial platform. 
A prosthesis as claimed in claim 3 wherein the slot is closed at one or
both ends (28,47), thereby providing a stop limiting the extent of sliding movement of

the meniscal component on the tibial platform in the anterior-posterior direction.
A prosthesis as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein said
medially displaced axis is located at the edge or beyond the physical extent of the tibial

platform.
A prosthesis as claimed in claim 1 wherein the guide means comprises
an abutment (50) on one of the tibial platforms (41) or the meniscal component (44)

which engages with a recess (51) on the other component.
A prosthesis as claimed in claim 7 wherein said the guide means
comprise an abutment which is upstanding from the tibial platform (41) and medially

displaced from the anterior-posterior centre line and engages with a recess in the
meniscal component (44).
A prosthesis as claimed in claim 8 wherein the abutment (50) is located
at the medial edge of the platform (41) and engages with a notch (51) at the

corresponding edge of the meniscal component (44).
A prosthesis as claimed in claim 8 or 9 wherein the recess (51) in the
meniscal component (44) is curved. 
A prosthesis as claimed in claim 1 which includes a stop (107) arranged
to limit the extent of rotational movement of the meniscal component on the tibial

platform.
A prosthesis according to claim 11 wherein the stop comprises an
abutment (107) upstanding from an edge of the tibial platform.
A prosthesis as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the
condylar bearing surfaces have a radius (R
3
) which substantially corresponds with
bearing surfaces in the meniscal component and the condylar surfaces being cut away

anteriorly (143) without affecting the patella bearing surface (144), whereby close conformity
between the condylar surfaces and the meniscal component is maintained while

maintaining a normal patella lever arm.
