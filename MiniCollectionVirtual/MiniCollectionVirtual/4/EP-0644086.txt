<ABSTRACT>
An extruded motor vehicle airbag restraint module 
housing (22) including a cover (18) which is integral with 

one or both sides (14, 16) of the housing (22) and forms 
one or two release doors which may be defined by tear lines 

of reduced thickness. The housing (22) may be incorporated 
into a module in which an airbag (38) is attached inside 

the housing (22) by means of rods (40, 44) sewn into the 
bag (38) around a substantially rectangular mouth being 

received in semi-cylindrical channels (34, 36) on opposed 
sides of the housing. The cover (18) may be integral with 

one side (14) and adherable or weldable to an upper edge of 
the other side (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vehicle airbag modules. More
particularly, it relates to a passenger side airbag module
comprising an extruded canister and novel airbag retention means.Conventional passenger side airbag modules comprise a
reaction canister of steel or aluminum. The canister is trough-shaped
and has an open top. A collapsed airbag is retained and
supported within and near the top of the canister by a retainer
or diffuser. The ends of the canister are closed by end plates.
The end plates include openings for receiving and supporting a
cylindrical gas generating inflator below the folded airbag. The
canister includes means for retaining thereon a separate cover
which may form a portion of the vehicle's instrument panel.
Examples of prior art modules may be found in U.S. Patent
4,941,678 of Lauritzen el al. (on which the pre-characterising
part of claim 1 is based) and the patents and applications
referenced therein. In the airbag module including the
Lauritzen canister the cover is formed separately from the
canister sidewalls and engages them by ribs which snap into
longitudinal channels in the sidewalls.It would be desirable to reduce both the weight and
complexity of the passenger side airbag module assembly. It
would also be desirable to provide such an assembly wherein the
reaction canister has a closed top to both retain the airbag 
within the module and prevent foreign objects from entering the
module prior to its installation in a vehicle.The primary object of the present invention is to
provide a passenger side airbag module assembly which has an
integral cover for protecting the folded airbag prior to
installation. A preferred object is to provide such a reaction
canister having improved means for assembling and retaining the
folded airbag within the canister. Another object is to provide
such an assembly which is lightweight and has substantially fewer
parts than prior art modules. Other objects, features and
advantages will become apparent from the following description
and appended claims.The foregoing objects are achieved by providing a
reaction canister with a body and integral cover extruded from
a high strength thermoplastic. The extrusion includes a pair of
semi-cylindrical channels on the inner sidewalls of the canister
for securing, by means of rods or dowels, the open mouth of the
airbag.FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an airbag module in
accordance with the invention, partially broken away to illustrate
its construction;  FIG. 2 is an enlarged detail of a portion of the

<CLAIMS>
A motor vehicle airbag restraint module housing
comprising a trough-shaped housing (22) having a bottom

portion connected to first and second sidewalls (14, 16)
defining a top therebetween and first and second open ends and

a cover (18) extending between said first and second ends for
closing said top, characterised in that said cover (18) is

integral with said housing.
The housing of claim 1 wherein said cover (18) is
integral with both of said first and second sidewalls (14, 16)

to form a tube.
The housing (22) of claim 1 wherein said cover (18) is
integral with one sidewall (14, 16) and confrontable with the

other sidewall (14, 16) so as to be weldable or adherable
thereto.
The housing of claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein said cover (18)
defines a tearline (30) along its length between said first

and second ends.
The housing of any preceding claim wherein inner surfaces
of said first and second sidewalls (14, 16) carry respective

first and second substantially parallel, semi-cylindrical,
channels (34, 36) extending between said first and second

ends.
An airbag assembly for use in a motor vehicle comprising
a rigid trough-shaped housing (22) and cover (18) combination

as claimed in any preceding claim, first and second end plates
(24, 26) closing the respective first and second ends of said

housing (22), an airbag (38) within said housing (22) having
an open mouth, and an inflator (46) within said housing (22)

connected to inflate the airbag (38) through its open mouth. 
The airbag assembly of claim 6
wherein said first and second channels (34, 36) extend along

the length of the housing on respectively opposite sides of
said inflator (46) and wherein said mouth of said airbag (38)

is substantially rectangular and is secured to said channels
(34, 36) by first and second rods (40, 44) carried by opposite

sides of said rectangular mouth and retained within said first
and second channels (34, 36) respectively.
The airbag assembly of Claim 7 wherein said rods (40, 44)
are sewn into said mouth of said airbag (38).
A method of manufacturing an airbag restraint module
assembly as claimed in Claim 6, 7 or 8 which comprises:


(a) extruding a trough-shaped housing (22) and integral
cover (18);
(b) cutting said housing (22) and cover (18) to a desired
length to form first and second open ends;
(c) inserting into said housing a collapsed airbag (38)
having an open, substantially rectangular, mouth;
(d) inserting into said housing and between said open
ends, a substantially cylindrical inflator (46), and
(e) closing the first and second open ends with
respective first and second end plates (24, 26).
A method of manufacturing an airbag restraint module
assembly as claimed in claim 9 wherein:


(i) step a involves extruding a trough-shaped housing
(22) with sides (14, 16) having inner surfaces defining first

and second parallel semi-cylindrical channels (34, 36); and 
(ii) in step c the airbag (38) has first and second rods
(40, 44) carried by opposite sides of said mouth and said

airbag insertion involves inserting said collapsed airbag (38)
into said housing (22) by sliding said first and second rods

(40, 44) into the respective first and second channels (34,
36).
