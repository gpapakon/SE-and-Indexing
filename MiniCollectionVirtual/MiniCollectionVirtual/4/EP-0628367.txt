<ABSTRACT>
Used foundry sand is fed in batches to a rubbing apparatus which detaches the binder shell from the sand grain, is removed from the rubbing apparatus (19) by means of a conveying device into an intermediate container with a dust-removal device and is recirculated several times between the latter and the rubbing apparatus by means of a conveying device. To optimise process management, the rubbing (R), dust removal (E) and recirculation (U) steps of the process are combined to form a control module M and a plurality of control modules M1 to Mn are formed, these differing in the percentage of the nominal output of the individual stages (R), (E) and (U) of the process. The control modules M1 to Mn are stored in a control unit and the rubbing apparatus, the conveying device and the dust-removal device are driven by the control unit with a sequence of control modules selected in accordance with the quality of the used sand.

Process for regenerating used foundry sands, in that the used sand is
supplied batchwise to a friction apparatus (19) for mechanically detaching

the binder covering from the sand grain, is removed by means of a conveyor
(20, 21) from the friction apparatus (19), dedusted and returned to the

friction apparatus (19) and optionally following several cycles is removed
as regenerated sand, characterized in that


the used sand is conveyed from the friction apparatus into an intermediate
vessel (16) having a dedusting device and is circulated several

times between the latter and the friction apparatus (19),
the process stages "friction" (R), "dedusting" (E) and "circulating" (U)
are combined into a control module M,
a plurality of control modules M
1
 to M
n
 is formed, which differ in the
percentage of the effective capacity of the individual process stages

(R), (E) and (U), based on their nominal capacity,
the control modules M
1
 to M
n
 are stored in a control device and
the friction apparatus (19), conveyor (20, 21) and dedusting device are
controlled by the control device with a sequence of control modules

selected in accordance with the used sand quality defined in a preceding
process stage.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the used sand is
firstly dried in a drier (11), is passed from the later into the intermediate

vessel (16) and is then circulated between the latter and the friction
apparatus (19), and that the process stage "drying" (T) is incorporated

into the control modules M
1
 to M
n
 with a different percentage of the effective
capacity of the drier, based on its nominal capacity, and that the friction

apparatus (19), conveyor (20, 21), dedusting device and drier (11) are
controlled with a sequence of control modules selected in accordance with

the used sand quality.
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the duration of
the treatment of the used sand is set for each control module M
1
 to M
n
.
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that
the quality of the used sand is determined on a sample, which is much

smaller than the batch, in an analyzing regenerator, comprising a friction 
apparatus and a dedusting device, by measuring a selection of the physical

characteristics of the used sand, and that by means of the measured values
obtained and which are associated by means of a program with specific control

modules M
1
 to M
n
 and a specific sequence of control modules, the control
modules and their sequence are controlled on the control device.
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in that a
sample of the used sand is filled into a sample vessel which is open at the

top up to a given level, is subject one or more times to the action from
above of a constant fall weight and the time pressure pattern on the bottom

of the sample vessel is recorded, and that the pressure pattern curve
qualifying the used sand is used for controlling the control modules and

their sequence.
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in that a
sample of the used sand with a predetermined weight is dried in a microwave

drier, the time temperature pattern in the sample is measured and the
temperature pattern curve qualifying the used sand is used for controlling

the control modules and their sequence.
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in that a
sample of the used sand is filled into a sample vessel which is open at the

top and is subject from below to the action of compressed air, whose pressure
is set in such a way that all the pa
rticles below a specific particle
size float and are discharged and the dust quantity occurring per unit of

time is determined gravimetrically or volumetrically, the thus obtained time
dust quantity gradient is recorded and the level of the dust quantity

gradient and its configuration is used for adjusting the duration of the
treatment in the friction apparatus.
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the
dust discharged during the dedusting of the used sand treated in the friction

apparatus is collected and the dust quantity obtained per time unit is gravimetrically
or volumetrically determined, the thus obtained time dust quantity

gradient is recorded and the dust quantity gradient level and its pattern are
used for adjusting the duration of the treatment in the friction apparatus. 
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 8, characterized in that,
prior to treatment, the used sand undergoes a preliminary dedusting and the

dust quantity gradient during preliminary dedusting is recorded, and that
in the case of a significant drop in the configuration of the dust quantity

gradient during preliminary dedusting, used sand is supplied to the drier or
friction apparatus and the treatment is started.
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 9, characterized in that
after dropping below a lower limit of the dust quantity gradient during

preliminary dedusting the dust obtained is discarded, whereas above said
limit the dust is collected for reuse.
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 10, characterized in that
an electrically operated friction apparatus is used, the power consumption

of the friction apparatus measured and the measured value is used as a
manipulated variable for the duration of the used sand treatment.
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 11, characterized in that
for determining the quality of the regenerated sand removed from the friction

apparatus one or more of the processes according to one of the claims
5 to 7 is used.
