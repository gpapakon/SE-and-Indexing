<ABSTRACT>
An elongated sheet metal terminal (10) is adapted 
to be crimped onto an exposed conductor (12) of an 

electrical wire (14), the conductor having a given cross-sectional 
area (12a). The terminal defines a longitudinal 

axis (18) and includes a mating end (20), a terminating end 
(22) and a transition section (24) therebetween. The 

terminating end (22) has a pair of spaced crimped walls 
(32), and the transition section has a pair of spaced 

transition walls (34) joining the crimp walls to the mating 
end. The transition section has a minimum cross-sectional 

area at any given axial location (A) of at least sixty-five 
percent of the given cross-sectional area of the conductor. 

The crimp walls (32) are adapted to be completely curled 
into generally semi-cylindrical configurations into 

crimping engagement with the conductor (12). The 
transition walls (34) are adapted to be partially curled 

into generally semi-frusto-conical configurations toward 
the conductor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of
electrical connectors and, particularly, to a connector
terminal which has walls for crimping onto the conductor of
an electrical wire.One type of terminal for terminating an
electrical wire within a connector, generally, is an
elongated sheet metal terminal adapted to be crimped onto
an exposed conductor of the electrical wire. The terminal
includes a mating end, a terminating end and a body or
transition section therebetween. The terminating end
usually includes two pairs of crimp walls. One pair of
walls crimps onto the outer cladding or insulation of the
electrical wire, and the other pair of walls crimps onto
the exposed conductor of the wire. The transition section
includes a base wall which is common to a bottom wall
between the crimp walls to define a generally U-shaped
configuration. The transition section may include side
walls coplanar with the conductor crimp walls, but the side
walls of the transition section are relatively short and
not as extensive as the crimp walls, because the sheet
metal material would tear during crimping of the crimp
walls onto the conductor. In essence, the side walls of
the transition section define a cut-out in the sides of the
terminal between the terminating end and the mating end.
In fact, a cut-out normally is formed between the
insulation crimp walls and the conductor crimp walls so
that the two pairs of walls can be crimped independently or 
at two different stages without tearing the sheet metal
material therebetween.One of the problems with electrical terminals as
described above concerns the electrical current carrying
capacity or the current flow characteristics of such
terminals. Specifically, when the side walls of the
terminal are cut-out or otherwise reduced in dimensions
between the conductor crimp walls and the mating end of the
terminal, the overall cross-sectional area of the terminal
is reduced in the transition section thereof. This, in
turn, reduces the current carrying capabilities of the
terminal. In addition, such reduced sections of the
terminal decrease the structural integrity of the terminal
at that point. In fact, such terminals have a tendency to
bend or deform at such transition sections.Such a terminal has been disclosed within US-Patent No. 5
145 422.The present invention is directed to solving
these problems and satisfying a need for an electrical
terminal as described above, with improved current flow
characteristics.An object, therefore, of the invention is to
provide a new and
