<ABSTRACT>
The combination solenoid valve and sump assembly comprises a solenoid valve (40, 140, 240, 340, 440) located within a stepped bore (16) of a modulator body (15) of an adaptative braking system (10). The solenoid valve (40, 140, 240, 340, 440) includes a slidable shuttle valve (50) disposed sealingly at an end thereof, and the sump (80, 180, 280, 380, 480) is disposed coaxially relative to the solenoid valve. A movable piston (70) engages sealingly both the solenoid valve (40) and a portion of the stepped bore (16) in a first embodiment, and is biased by a spring (73, 74) located concentrally relative to the windings (41) of the solenoid valve (40). The stepped bore (16) communicates with a pump (14) which, along with a master cylinder (20), provides fluid pressure to appropriate portions of the stepped bore (16). The movable piston (70), solenoid valve (40), and stepped bore (16) define a sump chamber (80) which receives fluid decayed away from a brake connection line (24) communicating with the stepped bore (16), and retains the fluid for communication to the pump (14) of the system (10). Other embodiments provide the movable piston (170, 242, 370, 470) at the rear of the solenoid valve (140, 340) and as a movable housing pole part (242), and located sealingly and slidably about a movable solenoid rod (443) of the solenoid valve (440).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a solenoid 
valve and sump for an adaptive braking system, and in 
particular to a concentric solenoid valve and sump assembly. Numerous adaptive braking systems have been proposed 
previously. Adaptive braking systems can typically include 
several solenoid valves, check valves, flow restrictions, 
shuttle valves, and various types of pressure sources and fluid 
retention mechanisms. In adaptive braking systems which 
comprise pumpback adaptive braking systems, it is typical to 
utilize a small low pressure displacement chamber or sump to 
receive fluid pressure from the brakes during the decay mode 
of operation. The sump permits the storage of low pressure 
fluid and communicates this fluid with the inlet side of the 
pressure source which usually comprises a pump. Typically, one 
sump is provided for each pumping circuit. It is highly 
desirable to integrate the sump with another portion of the 
adaptive braking system in order to eliminate communication 
ports, plugs and piping associated therewith. Previously, 
sumps have been combined with adaptive braking system devices 
such as an accumulator. U. S. Patent Nos. 4,738,595 and 
4,769,990 illustrate combined accumulator and sump 
constructions. JP-A-58-49548 and JP-A-58-61053 disclose sumps 
located within housing chambers located behind solenoid valves. 
Pumpback types of adaptive braking systems may now be provided 
without the necessity of an accumulator, which further 
simplifies and reduces the cost of the entire system. 
Therefore, it is highly desirable to combine the sump with a 
part of the system that is directly in the path of fluid 
flowing to the pump. It would be very advantageous if the sump 
could be combined with a solenoid valve utilized in a pumping 
circuit. The present invention provides solutions to the above 
problems by a combination solenoid valve and sump, comprising 
a body having therein a stepped bore, a solenoid valve disposed 
within the bore and operable to open a valve associated 
therewith in order to communicate one portion of the stepped  
 
bore with another portion thereof, the bore communicating with 
a source of pressurized fluid and with means for supplying 
fluid, and a movable piston and a spring, characterized in that 
the movable piston and spring are disposed concentrically 
around said solenoid valve, the movable piston sealingly 
engaging both the bore and the solenoid valve to define 
therewith the variable volume sump chamber communicating with 
the fluid
