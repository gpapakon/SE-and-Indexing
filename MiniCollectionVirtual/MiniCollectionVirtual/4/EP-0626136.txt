<ABSTRACT>
Methods of making shelf stable condensed sweetened dairy 
concentrates, and thereby preserving the dairy fat while 

retaining the flavor and texture characteristics of fresh dairy 
products, involve mixing together fat and non fat milk solids 

including a fresh dairy component, and sugar, to make a blend, 
evaporating the blend to at least 70% total solids, and 

recovering the product as the dairy concentrate. The 
concentrates so made comprise, in combinations, about 15% to 

about 37% fat, 4% to about 17% non fat milk solids, and enough 
sugar to avoid deleterious effects related to growth of 

pathogenic organisms based on activity internal to the 

concentrate. Sandiness due to lactose crystallization at above 
7% non fat milk solids can be avoided by seeding the evaporated 

blend. The concentrate can be used in a variety of applications, 
including the production of frozen dairy desert mixes made by 

adding sugar and non fat milk solids as desired to the 
concentrate. Typically, all the fat is provided by the 

concentrate, such that no other fat is added in making the mix, 
the mix being the formula ultimately consumed by a consumer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to condensed sweetened dairy 
concentrates and methods for making such concentrates. As used herein, "fresh non fat milk solids" includes any 
source, or combination of sources, of non fat milk solids in which 
the milk protein has not been degraded by drying. Thus, the 
"fresh" designation includes, but is not exhausted by, fresh whole 
milk, fresh skim milk, condensed skim milk, and condensed whole 
milk. It does not include non fat dry milk. As used herein, "fresh dairy fat" means any dairy fat whose 
flavor and texture have not been degraded by previous processing. 
Thus, fresh dairy fat includes fresh cream and sweetened condensed 
whole milk. As used herein "fresh dairy components" includes any milk 
product or extract whose flavor and/or texture properties have not 
been degraded through previous processing. It includes either 
dairy fat or non fat milk solids, or both. As used herein "fresh dairy products" means fresh whole milk 
and products extracted from fresh whole milk without going through 
an evaporative or other process that extracts large quantities of 
water. We do include herein pasteurized products. As used herein, "fresh whole milk" means fresh milk as 
received from the dairy farm. As used herein, "fresh milk" means either fresh whole milk or 
such milk after the cream has been separated as by a centrifuge, 
namely the product commonly known as fresh skim milk. As used herein, "fresh cream" means the cream as separated 
from fresh whole milk. As used herein, "shelf stable," means that the product has an 
extended shelf life of at least 90 days at ambient conditions with 
no deleterious growth of organisms based on activity internal to 
the product. "Shelf stable" thus makes no statement with respect 
to mold or yeast growth, which depend on e.g. air as an external 
input. As used herein, all percents are percent by weight, unless 
otherwise indicated.  The food industry, especially in baking, in candy making, and 
in making frozen dairy desert mixes, uses a large amount of fat in 
combinations with non fat milk solids (NFMS). The food industry 
thus requires a large quantity of dairy products such as milk and 
preferably cream, as raw materials, to be available at a uniform 
rate of supply. The requirement for a uniform rate of supply of dairy products 
as raw materials for use in the food industry is contrasted with 
a rate of supply coming from the farm that varies seasonally 
according to farm output of dairy products. Supply of fresh dairy products as
