<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coated stent,
in particular to a biocompatible polymer-coated stent
and to a process for the manufacturing thereof.Stenosis resolution of cylindrically-shaped hollow
biological structures, such as circulatory system vessels,
esophagus, bile ducts, intestine, urinary tracts
and respiratory tract, at present have several possibilities
offered by surgery, endoscopy, radiology.Sometimes the pathological entity does not allow
surgical practice, in this case endoscopic operation or
radiologic intervention are practised for palliative
and/or curative purpose.The use of stents, namely expandable devices which
have the purpose to maintain the stenotic lumen patent,
is a technique always in progress (K.C. Wright et al.;
Radiology, 156:69-72,1985; J.C. Palmaz et al.; ibid.,
164:705-708, 1987; G.K. McLean et al., ibid., 170:961-967,
1989).Present uses of stents refer to the treatment of
stenosis of bile ducts, arterial vessels, esophagus,
urinary tracts and respiratory tract. Stents are also
used in repair of aneurysms.The mesh structure of stents, whilst on one hand
allows their percutaneous application through catheters
and ensures the mechanical characteristics that maintain
the lumen patency, on the other hand puts some
problems according to specific cases. In the event of a
stent implant in a blood vessel, the stent structure may
perturb haemodynamics, therefore increasing the risk of 
thrombus formation. If the stenosis is caused by neoplastic
proliferation, ristenosis may occur after stent
implant because of tumour cell infiltration through the
meshes of the stent itself (Severini, Cozzi, Bellomi,
Cigada, Tanzi; Biomateriali, 3/4 (1990) 79-84).In most cases, stents are made of metallic materials,
particularly stainless steel, titanium, or shape-memory
alloys (Ni-Ti alloys). Said materials meet
the structural and mechanical requirements, but involve
some problems of biocompatibility and allergy, particularly
when they come in contact with blood.EP 0 480 667, in the name of Cook Inc., discloses
a self-expanding percutaneous stent (Gianturco stent)
covered by a flexible sleeve which is open at both
ends. The flexible sleeve is welded or pinched at the
ends of the stent. In the same reference, the possibility
to coat the stent with plastic material is mentioned,
but no specific teaching about the material nor
the coating technique is provided.Song et al., Radiology, 1991,; 180:349-354, describe
a Gianturco stent wrapped with a nylon mesh coated
by silicon rubber, for the

is coated with a thermoplastic polycarbonate urethane, and

in that the inner surface of the polymer-coated stent is
totally smooth, whilst the outer surface perfectly fits to

the stent mesh structure.
