<ABSTRACT>
A titanium aluminide is composed of 31 to 34 mass % of Al, 1.5 
to 3.0 mass % of Fe, 0.5 to 2.0 mass % of V, 0.18 to 0.35 mass 

% of B with remainder being Ti and inevitable impurities. The 
0.5 to 2.0 mass % of V may be replaced with a 1.0 to 3.0 mass 

% of Mo or a 0.3 to 1.5 mass % of Cr. By precision casting 
this alloy, can be obtained a novel titanium aluminide alloy 

in which numerous whisker-like Ti-B compound are uniformly 
dispersed. The titanium aluminide alloy does not possess 

coarse lamellar structure which would cause crackings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to titanium aluminide, i. e., an
intermetallic compound known by a chemical formula of TiAl, as
an advanced material for precision casting. It relates in
particular to that species of titanium aluminide whose
fluidity is excellent, the precision cast articles made
therefrom will have a high strength as cast state and will not
crack even when their thickness is small.Titanium aluminide
(this substance will be referred to
as "TiAl" hereinafter) is drawing attention as an advanced
material for its higher specific strength at high temperature
than those of the nickel-base superalloys and better oxidation
resistance than those of the titanium alloys. Since TiAl has
other admirable properties in addition such as low density,
the strength which becomes greater with elevating temperature
and good creep resistance, there are demands to make aircraft 
jet engine parts such as blades and vanes out of this material
in the form of thin and intricately configured precision cast
articles.On the other hand, however, TiAl is known to have a low
ductility at ambient temperature and have a strong dependency
on the deforming speed even at high temperatures where
sufficient toughness develops. To overcome these difficulties,
researches are being conducted from crystal structural and
physical metallurgical viewpoints. For example, methods of
improving the low ductility by strengthening the grain
boundaries have been proposed in Japanese Patent Applications
JP-A-61-41740 (1986), JP-A-1-255632 (1989), JP-A-1-287243 (1989) and JP-A-1-298127 (1989) and
in US Patent No. 4,294,615.From the JP-A-129 8127 (Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 14, No.
80 (C-689) February 15, 1990) a light-weight heat-resisting
alloy is known, containing by weight 30 -36 % Al, one or more
kinds among 0.01 to 0.5 % B, C and Si, and 0.1 to 8 % V and the
balance consisting of Ti. This results in Al-to-Ti mass %
content ratio from 0.44 to 0.61. With such a composition, the
cold ductility of the alloy is to be improved without impairing
the excellent high temperature strength of TiAl.Despite these efforts, however, the reality is that precision
cast articles made of binary Ti-Al alloy remain so liable to
cracking that they cannot be called an industrial product. Even
with addition of a third element, e. g., V, which the above-mentioned
US Patent has found effective to improve a ductility,
ternary Ti-Al-V alloys containing appreciable amounts of the
third element, e. g. , V as much as 1.5 mass %, cannot make
castings, such as
