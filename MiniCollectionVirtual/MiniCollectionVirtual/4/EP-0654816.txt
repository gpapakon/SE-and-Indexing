<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a method of planarizing microstructures 
and, in particular, relates to one such method including the step of subjecting a 
microstructure having a planarization layer thereon to a plasma assisted chemical etching 
step. During the present manufacture of microstructures, such as integrated circuits, it is 
customary to form a structure in, or on, a surface and subsequently, usually in 
anticipation of another fabrication step, form a plane layer of material over the structure 
so that the following fabrication step can be performed on a smooth flat surface. Further, 
the planarization layer of material serves as an electrical, and or thermal, insulation 
between the structures. Typically, the process can be repeated a number of times 
throughout the fabrication of an integrated circuit. Currently, the final planarization step is performed by the physical and or 
chemical, polishing of a self-leveling coating. That is, the microstructure is covered by a 
planarization layer of material such that the microstructure is completely covered and the 
exposed surface of the material is relatively smooth. The planarization layer of material 
is then physically and/or chemically polished by use of conventional and commercially 
available equipment. This conventional method has numerous drawbacks. For example, 
the actual polishing, regardless of whether it is performed by physical polishing, 
conventional chemical etching or reactive ion etching, generally leaves defects in the 
surface of the self-leveling layer of material that reduce the accuracy of subsequent 
processing steps, thereby reducing the overall yield of the manufacturing process. 
Further, conventional chemical and mechanical techniques result in non-uniform thickness 
in the final film. In addition, particularly in the field of modern integrated circuit 
fabrication, these conventional processes can be a source of particulate contamination that 
can significantly reduce the yield of the integrated circuit manufacturing process. 
Clearly, the common detraction of conventional polishing processes is that physical  
 
contact with the self-leveling material is required. Further, the material of the self-leveling 
layer must be chosen with great care to ensure its compatibility with the requisite 
temperatures and materials to which it is exposed during the subsequent processes. Hence, a method of planarizing microstructures that is accurate and clean is highly 
desirable in the general industry of
