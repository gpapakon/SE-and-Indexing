<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to surgical instruments 
used to perform circular anastomosis of tubular tissue sections 
and, more particularly, to a surgical instrument suitable for 
installation of multi-ring compression devices for circular 
anastomosis of tubular tissue sections. The disclosure of 
EP-A-595 094 
(document under Art.54(3) EPC) 
includes drawings corresponding to accompanying 
drawings Figures 1 to 23. EP-A-324 858 discloses the 
technical features of the pre-characterising part of claim 1 
below. Some surgical procedures, such as repair of the 
colon, require the joining of two rather large sections of 
tubular tissue. During these procedures, a diseased area of 
tissue is excised leaving two free ends of healthy tissue to be 
joined. Some known methods of joining the tissues include 
stapling or suturing the ends together. A more recent 
advancement in the art, called a multi-ring compression device, 
is used to clamp the free ends of the tissue between a series 
of interlocking rings whose centers are then cut away. Typically, a multi-ring compression device consists 
of an outer ring assembly which fits over an intermediary ring. 
The two rings are then locked together by inserting an inner 
ring in the intermediary ring which locks in place. In use the free open ends of tissue are captured 
between the outer ring assembly and the intermediary ring. The 
entire assembly is then locked together by insertion of the 
inner ring. The inner core of the ring assembly is then cut 
away along with any excess tissue. The clamped tissue within 
the rings is deprived of blood causing necrosis to take place.  
 
The outer tissue heals while the necrosised inner tissues and 
clamps are detached and expelled by the body. Newer clamps or 
compression rings, such as those shown in U.S. Patent No. 
4,966,602, have a fragmentable structure which enhances the 
bodies ability to expel the device. Various surgical instruments have been developed to 
install the multi-ring compression devices. One known surgical 
instrument used to install the compression rings is shown in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,681,108 to Rosati et al. This instrument 
generally comprises a cylindrical housing having means for 
aligning the rings within the tubular tissue sections, driving 
means for clamping the rings together in locking arrangement 
around the tissue sections and cutting means for removing 
excess tissue ends and detaching the instrument from the rings. 
In the Rosati et al. instrument, the cutting means consists of 
an

<CLAIMS>
A surgical instrument (300) for application of surgical 
fasteners to a first hollow organ tissue section and a 

second hollow organ tissue section for anastomosis 
thereof, said surgical instrument comprising: 


(a) a frame portion (302); 
(b) retraction means (306) slidingly disposed within 
said frame portion for collecting a first tissue section 

and a second tissue section to be fastened; 
(c) pushing means (346) slidingly disposed within 
said frame portion for application of surgical fasteners 

to the collected first and second tissue sections; 
(d) coring means (350, 352) slidingly disposed 
within said frame portion, and engageable with said 

pushing means for advancement thereof, for coring excess 
tissue captured between the collected first and second 

tissue sections; and 
(e) resilient means (348) associated with said 
pushing means for alternately engaging and disengaging 

said pushing means with said coring means, wherein said 
resilient means engages said pushing means with said 

coring means during application of the surgical fasteners 
and said resilient means disengages said pushing means 

from said coring means during coring; and wherein: 
(f) said coring means includes a knife assembly 
(350), having a blade member (352) at a distalmost end 

for cutting said excess tissue, said knife assembly 
having engagement means (396) for engaging said resilient 

means; and the instrument being characterised by: 
(g) a knife shield (376) affixed to said frame 
portion (302) and extending distally of said blade member 

(352) when said blade member is in a proximalmost 
position.

disengages from said engagement means during coring of 

the excess tissue. 
The surgical instrument as recited in claim 2 wherein 
said engagement means comprises a recess (396) in said 

knife assembly (350) and wherein said frame portion 
includes a chamber at a distal end thereof having an 

enlarged area portion (368) and a reduced area portion 
(370) proximal of said enlarged area portion, said at 

least one shifter member being resiliently biased away 
from said recess such that when said at least one shifter 

member and said recess are within said reduced area 
portion of said frame portion said shifter member is 

urged into engagement with said recess thereby engaging 
said pushing means with said coring means, and when said 

at least one shifter member and said recess are advanced 
into said enlarged area portion of said frame portion 

said at least one shifter member is biased out of 
engagement with said recess thereby disengaging said 

pushing means from said coring means. 
The surgical instrument as recited in claim 3 wherein the 
surgical fasteners (52, 72, 94) include at least a first 

ring (94) and a second ring (72) for fastening the first 
and second tissue sections therebetween. 
The surgical instrument as recited in claim 4 wherein 
said retraction means comprises: 


(a) support means (414) located distally of said 
frame portion for holding said first ring;  

 
(b) a tail member (418) rotatably mounted at a 
proximal end of said frame portion; and 
(c) a retraction transmission assembly (98) affixed 
at a distal end to said support means and engageable at a 

proximal end with said tail member such that rotation of 
said tail member causes axial movement of said retraction 

transmission assembly, and thus of said support means; 
 
   wherein said pushing means includes a pusher member 

(346) having a circumferential flange (386) adapted to 
support said second ring (72) during coring of the first 

and second tissue sections after fastening, whereby, 

(a) rotating said tail member (418) draws said first 
ring (94) proximally adjacent said frame portion 

collecting the first and second tissue section 
therebetween;
