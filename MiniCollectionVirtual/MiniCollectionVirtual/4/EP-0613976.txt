<CLAIMS>
Use of an acrylamide homopolymer or copolymer
consisting of 70 to 100% by weight of acrylamide and 0

to 30% by weight of acrylic acid, in each case based on
the weight of the monomers, in an amount of 
<
0.04 g per
litre of dye liquor as anticrease agent in exhaust

dyeing processes.
Use according to claim 1, wherein the
acrylamide homopolymer or copolymer is in the form of

an aqueous formulation.
Use according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the
acrylamide homopolymer or copolymer has a molecular

weight of 800 000 to 15 million.
Use according to any one of claims to 1 to 3,
wherein the acrylamide homopolymer or copolymer is an

acrylamide/acrylic acid copolymer containing 
>
70% by
weight of acylamide, based on the weight of the

monomers.
Use according to claim 4, wherein the
acrylamide/acrylic acid copolymer consists of 75 to 90%

by weight of acrylamide and 10 to 25% by weight of
acylic acid, based in each case on the weight of the

monomers.
Use according to claim 4 or 5, wherein the
acrylamide/acylic acid homopolymer or copolymer has a

molecular weight of 800 000 to 15 million.
Use according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
wherein 0.0005 to 0.03 g/l liquor of the acrylamide

homopolymer or copolymer is used. 
Use according to any one of claims 1 to 6 for
dyeing textile fibre material comprising cellulosic

fibres, synthetic polyamide fibres or polyester fibres.
Use according to claim 8, wherein the textile
fibre material is textile fibre material comprising

polyester fibres and is dyed with disperse dyes at a
temperature from 80 to 135Â°C.
Use according to any one of claims 1 to 6 for
dyeing polyacrylonitrile fibres with cationic dyes.
