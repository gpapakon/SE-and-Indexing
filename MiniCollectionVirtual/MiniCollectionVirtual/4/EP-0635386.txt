Wind deflector in a roof opening of a motor vehicle, comprising a 
frame which edges the roof opening and in which a sliding roof or a roof 

viewing window is mounted to be longitudinally displaceable, which wind 
deflector is provided extending transversely in the roof opening at the 

front and is mounted at the frame to be pivotably movable in such a 
manner that the wind deflecting par
t during sliding back of the sliding 
roof or of the roof viewing window in or out of the roof opening is 

raised so far under the effect of spring forces that the travel wind 
deflects by the deflecting surface extending obliquely upwardly in travel 

direction, characterised thereby that the wind deflector (1, 2, 3; Fig. 
1) consists of a metal die casting and is produced in the die casting 

process, that the wind deflecting part (1) of the wind deflector has a 
cross-sectional shape which extends in the shape of a triangle and the 

apex of which is disposed at the upper side, and that chambers with 
reinforcing ribs are worked into the body from the underside. 
Wind deflector according to claim 1, characterised thereby that it 
consists of magnesium or a magnesium alloy. 
Wind deflector according to claim 1, characterised thereby that it 
consists of aluminium or aluminium alloys. 
Wind deflector according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby that the wind deflector (middle part 1) has lateral 

limbs (2 and 3), which extend rearwardly and at the ends of which are 
fastened bearing elements (pins 8 and 9) which are mounted in the frame 

of the sliding roof or of the roof viewing window to be pivotably 
movable, and that leaf springs (6 and 7) extending downwardly in the 

direction of the pivot bearing are provided at the underside of the limbs 
(2 and 3) and are supported at a side wall of the frame, the wind 

deflector being pressable down against the force of the leaf springs 
during pushing forward of the roof window or of the sliding roof when 

closing.  
 
Wind deflector according to claim 4, characterised thereby that 
bearing chambers (13) for reception of the leaf springs (6) in the 

pressed-down state of the wind deflector in the frame of the roof window 
are provided in the lateral limbs (2 and 3). 
Wind deflector according to claim 4 or 5, characterised thereby that 
the spring (6) is cast into the metal of the wind deflector by an 

anchoring end and the resilient limb protrudes out of the plane of the 
lateral limb (2 or 3). 
Wind deflector according to one of claims 4 to 6, characterised 
thereby that the leaf spring (6) is constructed to be relatively narrow 

and has a slightly curved lower slide surface (projection 10), which on 
the pressing down engages on a slide counter-surface of the frame, and/or 

that a synthetic material slide cushion (12) is mounted or injection 
moulded on at the end. 
Wind deflector according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby that two or more synthetic material damping 

cushions are mounted or injection moulded on at the underside and 
distributed over the length. 
Method of manufacturing a wind deflector according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised thereby that the wind deflector is 

produced in the hot chamber process or in the cold chamber process from 
magnesium or aluminium or alloys thereof as a die cast part and that 

prior to the die casting the spring is placed by its anchoring end, which 
is to be embedded, into the mould. 
Method according to claim 9, characterised thereby that in a further 
working step the synthetic material slide cushion is injection moulded at 

the spring and/or the synthetic material damping cushion is injection 
moulded onto the underside of the wind deflector. 
Method according to claim 10, characterised thereby that the 
synthetic material damping cushion is anchored by injection moulding in a 

recess.
