<ABSTRACT>
In the instrumental analysis of liquid samples, so-called titer plates are used which are usually made of transparent material. Depending on the sample and type of the material, these form a concave or convex liquid surface and often falsify the results of measurement in the analysis. By means of a multi-well arrangement (11; 2) composed of two materials of different physical properties, the surface tension may be adjusted at the liquid surface (20) so that this is at least approximately flat. The bases (2) are preferably fabricated from a transparent material so that the analyses and observations may be made by transmission. The principle use of such titer plates is considered to be in electrooptical instrumental analysis.

<CLAIMS>
A multiwell arrangement for instrumental analysis of at least temporarily liquid samples, 
wherein at least the well bottoms consist of a transparent material and are situated in one 

plane, characterised in that materials of different physical properties are provided for the 
well walls (1) and for the well bottoms (2), wherein the material of the well walls (1) is 

chosen in such a manner that, depending on the sample to be analysed, the interfacial 
tension resulting between the sample and the well wall (1) forms at least approximately a 

planar sample surface (20), and the well bottom (1) is chosen from a material suitable for 
the observation and/or analysis of the sample. 
A multiwell arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in that the well walls (1) 
consist of an apolar thermoplastic, and at least the well bottoms (2) consist of a 

transparent thermoplastic. 
A multiwell arrangement according to Claim 2, characterised in that the individual well 
bottoms (2) are combined in a plate-like manner and are in the form of elevations (2'). 
A multiwell arrangement according to Claim 3, characterised in that the well walls (1) 
surround the elevations (2') so as to form a non-positive and tight connection, and form 

individual wells (11) with the said elevations. 
A multiwell arrangement according to Claim 2, characterised in that the thermoplastic of 
the well walls (1) is a polyolefine or a polytetrafluoroethylene, and the thermoplastic of 

the well bottoms (2) consists of a polystyrene, a polystyrene copolymer, 
polymethylmethacrylate, polycarbonate, polyethersulphone, polysulphone, 

polymethylpentene, styreneacrylonitrile, amorphous polyamide or a 
polyethyleneterephthalate. 
A multiwell arrangement according to Claim 1 or 6, characterised in that the well 
walls (1) and/ or well bottoms (2) have at least a partial sample-adsorbing surface. 
A multiwell arrangement according to Claim 4, characterised in that connecting webs (4) 
provided between the wells (11) and/ or the wells (11) and/ or a common protective 

cover (15) mounted on the wells (11) have colour markers which label the samples and 
enable the said probes to be distinguished from each other.  

 
A multiwell arrangement according to Claim 4, characterised in that at least two 
wells (11) are combined to form individual sub-assembly units. 
A multiwell arrangement according to Claim 8, characterised in that the individual sub-assemblies 
extend via spigot holes (5) on spigot shafts/ distance elements (6) which are 

positioned perpendicular to the well bottoms (2). 
Use of the multiwell arrangement according to any one of Claims 1 to 9 for electro-optical 
instrumental analysis.
