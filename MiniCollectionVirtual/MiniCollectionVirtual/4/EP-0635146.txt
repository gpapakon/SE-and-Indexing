<ABSTRACT>
An electrophotographic printing device for the simultneous printing of both sides of a substrate contains two printing modules (10/1 and 10/2) with appropriate electrophotographic processing means (11 to 15) which are secured opposite each other in the printing device in such a way that a conveyor channel (25) for the substrate (21) is opened between the printing modules (10/1 and 10/2). The substrate (21) is guided over conveyors in the form of pairs of rollers to that its front and/or back can be brought into contact with the appropriate intermediate substrate (14) of the appropriate printing module (10/1 and 10/2). The pairs of rollers used are the reversing rollers for the intermediate substrate (14) co-operating with a counter-roller (23) or the opposed reversing rollers (22) for the intermediate substrate (14).

Electrophotographic printing device for printing 
both sides of a recording medium (21), having 


a first printing module (10/1) with electrophotographic 
processing means (11 to 13, 15) for generating 

a rear side toner image assigned to a rear side of the 
recording medium (21) on a photoconductor (11) and a 

continuous belt-shaped intermediate carrier (14) which 
takes over the toner image from the photoconductor 

(11) and is intended for transferring and fixing the 
rear side toner image on the rear side of the 

recording medium (21) ; 
a second printing module (10/2) with electrophotographic 

processing means (11 to 13, 15) for generating 
a front side toner image assigned to a front side of 

the recording medium (21) on a photoconductor (11) and 
a continuous belt-shaped intermediate carrier (14) 

which takes over the toner image from the 
photoconductor (11) and is intended for transferring 

the front side toner image onto a front side of the 
recording medium (21), 
 
wherein the printing modules (10/1, 10/2) are secured 

opposite one another in the printing device in such a 
way that a conveyor channel (25) for the recording 

medium (21) is opened between the printing modules, in 
which channel the recording medium (21) is guided over 

guide means (22, 23) in such a way that it can be 
brought into contact with its rear side and/or front 

side with the corresponding associated intermediate 
carrier (14) of the printing modules (10/1, 10/2).  

 
Electrophotographic printing device according to 
Claim 1, having a pair of rollers (22, 23) as guide 

means, which has a guide roller (22) around which the 
respective intermediate carrier (14) is wound and a 

counter roller (23) which presses the recording medium 
(14) against the guide roller (22). 
Electrophotographic printing device according to 
Claim 1, having a pair of rollers as guide means, which 

has, arranged in opposition in the conveyor channel (25), 
guide rollers (22) around which the respective intermediate 

carrier (14) is wound, between which the 
recording medium is passed in a print transfer and fixing 

gap formed by the rollers (22). 
Electrophotographic printing device according to 
one of Claims 2 or 3, wherein the design of at least one 

of the rollers (22, 23) of the pair of rollers is such 
that it can be swung in and out. 
Electrophotographic printing device according to 
one of Claims 2 to 4, wherein the design of at least one 

of the rollers (22, 23) of the pair of rollers is such 
that it can be heated. 
Electrophotographic printing device according to 
one of Claims 1 to 5, having an electromotor device (18) 

which can swing the intermediate carrier into and away 
from the photoconductor when required. 
Electrophotographic printing device according to 
one of Claims 1 to 6, having a thermal transfer belt as 

intermediate carrier (14).
