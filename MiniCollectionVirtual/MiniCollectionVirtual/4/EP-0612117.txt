<ABSTRACT>
A nonaqueous secondary battery comprising a cathode, an 
anode and a nonaqueous electrolyte disposed and sealed 

between the cathode and the anode wherein the anode is made 
of a carbon material as its active material, in which the 

carbon material comprises a fine core particle of a metal or 
an alloy thereof, and a carbon layer which is arranged and 

stacked in an onion-like shell configuration centering on 
the fine core particle, at least part of the carbon layer 

having a crystal structure in which graphite-like layers are 
stacked and the fine core particle having an average diameter 

of about 10 to 150nm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to nonaqueous secondary
batteries. More particularly it relates to a nonaqueous
secondary battery using a carbon material as an anode.Along with the reduction in the size of electronic
apparatus and conservation of electric power, a stronger
demand is made on creating a secondary battery of an alkali
metal type having a high energy density in which an alkali
metal such as lithium or the like is used. However, when an
alkali metal is used in an anode, batteries using a lithium
metal, for example, have a drawback that a repetition of
charging and discharging cycles produces a dendrite on the
lithium metal thereby causing an internal short circuit in
batteries. On the other hand, a lithium/aluminum alloy is
proposed as a substitute for the lithium metal. Use of the
alloy suppresses the generation of a dendrite. However such
batteries using the alloy as an anode have a short cycle
life in the deep discharge depth. Thus no essential improvement
is made on such batteries. Consequently an attention is
paid to a carbon material excellent in cycle properties and
safety, which material permits lithium to be intercalated
and deintercalated in the form of an ion. A certain kind of 
carbon material in which lithium is intercalated to form an
interlayer compound is accompanied by an electrochemical
reaction such as intercalation and deintercalation of lithium
ions in an organic electrolyte including a lithium salt
thus enabling a reversible oxidation-reduction reaction.
Carbon materials are quite promising as an anode of lithium
secondary batteries. Thus a brisk study is performed on
secondary batteries using carbon materials.Carbon has various forms because graphite-like planes
are expanded in two dimensions and stacked in various ways.
Thus it is possible to obtain various carbons depending on
starting materials and production methods. Carbons can be
classified into several groups from the viewpoint of an
orientation state or fine structure therein. They include
random orientation microtexture in which graphite-like layer
stacked at random, a planar orientation microtexture in
which graphite-like layers are oriented along a reference
plane, an axial orientation microtexture in which graphite-like
layers are oriented along an axis (including coaxial
cylindrical structure in which graphite-like layers are
cylindrically oriented relative to a reference axis, and
radial structure in which graphite-like layers are radially
oriented relative to a reference axis), a point orientation
