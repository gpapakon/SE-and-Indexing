<ABSTRACT>
A process for the cross-linking of a polymer composition which comprises a thermoplastic crystalline or amorphous (co)polymer comprising repeating units containing at least one amide group and 10-90 parts by weight, based on the amount of amide (co)polymer, of an unsaturated natural or synthetic rubber, is disclosed. The process is characterized by the choice of a specific, high temperature C-C initiator which leads to improved properties in the cross-linked polymer blend. In addition, the use of a high temperature C-C initiator to cross-link a polymer composition which comprises a thermoplastic crystalline or amorphous (co)polymer comprising repeating units containing at least one amide group and 10-90 parts by weight, based on the amount of amide (co)polymer, of an unsaturated natural or synthetic rubber, is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Crosslinking of Rubbers with Engineering PlasticsThe present invention relates to a process for the crosslinking of rubbers blended with engineering plastics and the products of that process. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the crosslinking of blends comprising at least one amide- containing polymer and at least one unsaturated rubber.Thermoplastic elastomeric blends which comprise a continuous thermoplastic polymer and a dispersed crosslinked rubber can be prepared by the so-called dynamic crosslinking process, wherein the rubber is crosslinked during mixing with the thermoplastic polymer. The temoerature used in the dynamic crosslinking process must be above the melting temperature of the thermoplastic polymer to ensure sufficient mixing. Conventional crosslinking agents known to be effective for the rubber employed in the blend, may be used in such a process. Several examples of such processes can be found in the prior art.J5 9109-539 discloses the vulcanization of a blend of polyamide resin, diene or olefin rubber, liquid diene rubber and a vulcanizing agent. As vulcanizing agents are disclosed organic peroxides and sulfur. Similarly, J5 9049-246 discloses blends of polyamide and acrylonitrile/butadiene rubber which are crosslinked with sulfur, organic peroxides or maleimides. Further, DE 3409414 relates to the same blends of polyamide with acrylonitrile/butadiene rubber which are crosslinked with sulfur or maleimides.J5 8206-667 relates to polyamide blends with ethylene/proplyene/diene (EPDM) which are crosslinked with organic peroxides. Similarly, 00 2115-264 relates to blends of polyamide with nitrile rubber which can be crosslinked with sulfur, organic peroxides or maleimides. Finally, GB 2,208,868 relates to blends of polyamide with nitrile rubber and 

 acrylic rubber wherein sulfur or organic peroxides may be used as the crosslinking agents.However, when engineering plastics having a high melting point are employed in blends with rubbers, conventional crosslinking systems such as sulfur and peroxide curing systems are often unsuitable because at such temperatures the crosslinking reaction will be too rapid, thus impairing the mixing of the rubber and engineering plastic. In this case, other curing systems may be used.For example, U.S. Patent 4,173,556 suggests the use of phenolic resin, peroxide, azide, quinoid or accelerated sulfur vulcanization systems for crosslinking blends of polyamides with rubbers. The use of a phenylene bismaleimide coagent is also
