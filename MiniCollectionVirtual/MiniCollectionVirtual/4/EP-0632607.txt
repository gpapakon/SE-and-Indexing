<ABSTRACT>
To protect operating personnel in the case of optical transmission paths fed by a laser, automatic laser shut-off - ALS - is provided, which can be activated via monitoring circuits. For measuring purposes, an activation facility is also required for the laser transmitter, even when the ALS function is active. However, this reconnection must not occur unintentionally, as a result of error. For this reason, the monitoring circuits are terminated according to the invention on the output side together with a timer which is to be regularly reset by a module computer, via a logic circuit which generates the actual activation command for the laser transmitter.
