<ABSTRACT>
An epitaxial cobalt silicide film is formed using a thin metal 
underlayer, which is placed underneath a cobalt layer prior to 

a heating step which forms the silicide film. More 
specifically, a refractory metal layer comprising tungsten, 

chromium, molybdenum, or a silicide thereof, is formed 
overlying a silicon substrate on a semiconductor wafer. A 

cobalt layer is formed overlying the refractory metal layer. 

Next, the wafer is annealed at a temperature sufficiently high 
to form an epitaxial cobalt silicide film overlying the 

silicon substrate. Following this annealing step, a cobalt-silicon-refractory 
metal alloy remains overlying the epitaxial 

cobalt silicide film. This silicide is then used to form a 
shallow P-N junction by dopant out-diffusion. First, either a 

P or N-type dopant is implanted into the silicide film so that 
substantially none of the dopant is implanted into the 

underlying silicon substrate. After implanting, the dopant is 
out-diffused from the silicide film into the underlying 

silicon substrate at a drive temperature sufficiently high to 
form the desired P-N junction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the formation of
cobalt silicide films for use in semiconductor devices and, in
particular, to the formation of epitaxial cobalt silicide
films using a thin metal underlayer.Cobalt silicide films are often used in CMOS integrated
circuits as a low resistance source for the out-diffusion of
dopants used to form shallow P-N junctions in source and drain
regions. Out-diffusion of these dopants typically requires
that the cobalt silicide film being used as a dopant source be
heated to a relatively high-temperature for an extended time
period in order to achieve a sufficient drive of the dopant
into an underlying silicon substrate. A significant
limitation on the use of these silicide films is that this
heating often causes agglomeration of the cobalt silicide
film. Agglomeration is disadvantageous because it produces
very thin points or opens at pre-existing grain boundaries in
the polycrystalline silicide and also results in a large
variation in the grain size and depth of the cobalt silicide
film. As a result, an agglomerated film exhibits large
variations in contact resistance, poor contact etch stopping,
and increased shallow junction leakage. Further, because
agglomeration is strongly correlated to decreasing silicide
thickness, prior cobalt silicide films have a practical lower
limit on their thickness when used as out-diffusion sources.
As the silicide film becomes thinner, agglomeration becomes
more pronounced for a given out-diffusion cycle. A method for
forming a silicide more resistant to agglomeration would
permit a thinner silicide to be used and a shallower junction
to be obtained (for a given out-diffusion drive cycle). Previous attempts have been made to reduce agglomeration and
thus improve the thermal stability of cobalt silicide films.
For example, it has been found that the formation of an
epitaxial cobalt silicide film exhibits improved thermal
stability relative to prior polycrystalline films. One prior
approach has formed an epitaxial cobalt silicide film by first
sputtering a 10-30 nm Ti layer and then sputtering a Co layer
over the Ti layer prior to the annealing step that forms the
epitaxial cobalt silicide film (such a process is disclosed in Materials Letters, vol. 17(1993), pages 383-387). However, this approach does
not provide a useful out-diffusion source because residual Ti
in the cobalt silicide and at the silicide surface forms
stable compounds with certain dopant atoms such as B, which is
used as a dopant in PMOS devices. The
