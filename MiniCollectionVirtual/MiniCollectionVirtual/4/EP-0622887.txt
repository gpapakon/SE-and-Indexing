<ABSTRACT>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
linear pulse motor capable of being configured even if the 

number of salient poles of a stator is odd and having 
increased ampere-conductors of a winding and large driving 

force. 
The linear pulse motor includes a stator having a 
plurality of salient poles 11, 12, ... 15 disposed at equal 

pitch angle and having an inner peripheral surface on which 
teeth 16 are formed in the direction of a shaft 16, and a 

mover 2 disposed movably in the shaft direction. A stator 
core 10 includes stator iron plates 30 laminated while 

rotated successively by the equal pitch angle of the salient 
poles. When k is an integer equal to or larger than 1, m is 

the number of phases, and n is equal to or smaller than m/2 
and nearest to m/2, the stator iron plates 30 has km salient 

poles P1, P2, ... P5. The stator iron plates 30 include k 
sets of salient poles each set including n salient poles 

having a small inner radius and (m-n) salient poles having a 
large inner radius arranged in order of the description being 

formed in top ends of the salient poles opposite to the mover 
as viewed from the side of the mover.

<DESCRIPTION>
A linear motor as mentioned in the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in EP-A-0 319 096. 
Said document shows a stator having a stator core provided with a plurality of salient 
poles disposed at equal pitch angle to be directed inward radially and a plurality of teeth 
disposed in a direction of a shaft in inner peripheral surfaces of said salient poles.Further 
there is provided a mover and a permanent magnet held intermediate of said stator core 
or the mover core and which is magnetised in the shaft direction. The present invention relates to a linear pulse motor. Fig. 7 is a longitudinal sectional view of a cylinder 
type linear pulse motor. The cylinder type linear pulse motor shown in Fig. 7 
includes a stator 100 composed of cores 101, 102, 103 and 104 
each formed into a stepped ring having an outer peripheral 
portion which is thick in the thickness direction thereof and 
a plurality of stator teeth 105 are formed on an inner 
peripheral surface of the core at equal pitch in the 
direction of a shaft of the motor. The cores 101, 102, 103 
and 104 are supported by a frame 116 and housed therein. A ring winding 106 is held in a ring groove formed by 
combining the stator cores 101 and 102 so that the outer 
peripheral portions thereof come into contact with each 
other. Similarly, a ring winding 107 is also held in a ring 
groove formed between the stator cores 103 and 104. The cylinder type linear pulse motor has two phases in 
total with one phase being constituted by the stator cores 
101 and 102 and the ring winding 106 and the other phase  
  
 
being constituted by the stator cores 103 and 104 and the 
ring winding 107. A ring permanent magnet 108 is held between the stator 
cores 101, 102 and 103, 104 constituting the two phases and 
is magnetized in the direction of the shaft of a mover 109. A core 110 of the mover 109 is cylindrical and includes 
a plurality of mover teeth 111 disposed on an outer periphery 
thereof at equal pitch in the shaft direction. The mover 109 
is supported by brackets 112 and 113 through bearings 114 and 
115. The stator teeth 105 and the mover teeth 111 have the 
following positional relation. That is, when the stator teeth 105 disposed in the 
stator core 104 is just opposite to the mover teeth 111, the 
stator teeth 105 disposed in the stator core 103 are shifted 
by 2/4 of a tooth pitch in the shaft direction relative to 
the stator core 104. Further, the stator teeth 105 disposed 
in the stator core 102 are shifted by 1/4 of the tooth pitch 
in the shaft
