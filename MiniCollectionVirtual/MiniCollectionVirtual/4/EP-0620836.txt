<ABSTRACT>
A concrete fluid structure deteriorated to the condition of removal of substance of the concrete by sulfuric acids and like corrosive material in contact therewith is restored by a substratum of epoxy foam, polyurethane foam, or a combination thereof having a relatively thin layer of polyvinyl chloride or polyethylene bonded to the outward facing surface of the foam and bonding the layer to the structure. A method for forming the substratum in the location of the deteriorated structure is described.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DETERIORATED STRUCTURE REPAIR METHOD AND SUBSTRATUM FOR RESTORING AND LINING CORRODED STRUCTURETO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:BE IT KNOWN THAT I, Richard L. Bertram, a resident of the County of Los Angeles, State of California and a citizen of the United States of America, have invented a new and useful 

Deteriorated Structure Repair Method and Substratum for Restoring and Lining Corroded Structure, of which the following is a specification:BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention:The present invention relates to the art of restoring deteriorated concrete or metal structures to resist corrosion, and more particularly to the application of polymer substances to restore substratum removed by corrosive deterioration and lining the restoration to resist corrosion.2. Description of the Prior Art:Waste water and sewerage are frequently conducted through fluid conduits made of concrete. In some applications, the conduits are made of metal. Sewer systems frequently have reservoirs, containers and ponds, such as settling ponds which also are made of concrete and sometimes of metal. Sewerage and waste water often contains highly corrosive material, especially with respect to concrete and metal. The closed system which constitutes most sewerage systems in use presently, creates anaerobic conditions ideal for the proliferation of anaerobic bacteria which result in hydrogen sulfide. Consequently, waste water pipes, sewage pipes, reservoirs, containers and ponds frequently are the subject of substantial corrosion and deteri¬ oration. In addition, corrosive material resulting from the 

digestive by-products of organisms existing within the waste water and sewer systems cause substantial deterioration of the concrete and metal conduits.Here in this specification for simplicity of explana¬ tion, reference will often be made to "conduits," by which term I intend to include not only conduits and pipes, but also reser¬ voirs, containers and ponds as discussed above. Such "con¬ duits," as that term is used herein, includes, for example, settling or processing "ponds" at sewerage processing plants, back-up reservoirs and building structures involved with such processing, unless the text specifies otherwise.The deterioration frequently takes the form of physi¬ cal decay of the walls of the conduits so that the thickness of the walls is reduced. Actual amounts of the concrete or metal are literally removed or worn away over the years. In many instances, sewer and waste water conduits and like structures have walls so
