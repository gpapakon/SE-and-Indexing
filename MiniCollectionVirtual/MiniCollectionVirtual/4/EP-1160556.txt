<ABSTRACT>
A first stationary electronic circuit exchanges information with a sensor coupled to a rotating shaft or similar. Information exchange is using electromagnetic waves or wave trains. The information relates to physical values being measured by the sensor. Both sensor and electronic circuit have antennae for transmission and receipt of data. An intermediate element, e.g. a cartridge, is placed between sensor and rotating shaft. An Independent claim is made for a system where the sensor used is an OFW sensor based on a quartz measurement sensor that emits a quasi-digital output signal, obviating the need for additional rotating electronics. An Independent claim is made for a method for producing, driving and delivering of drives with a sensor system, gears, rectifiers and or electric motors.
