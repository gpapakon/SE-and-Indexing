<ABSTRACT>
Seat belt anchoring device which carries two locking casings (18) mounted with articulation on a plate (20) rigidly joined to a strong element of the floor (1) of the vehicle via a fastening member (21), characterised in that the said plate (20) extends symmetrically in two wings from a central fastening region, the ends of which respectively bear a retaining tongue (41) folded towards the said central region and engaged in an oblong opening (43) bounded by a bearing edge which opposes extraction of the said tongue (41) under the effect of a tensile force exerted on the locking casing (18).

<CLAIMS>
An anchorage arrangement for safety belts which carries two 
locking casings (18) mounted pivotably on a plate (20) rigidly connected 

to a strong element of the floor (1) of the vehicle by way of a fixing 
member (21), said plate (20) extending symmetrically by way of two limbs 

(40) from a central fixing zone, the ends of which respectively bear a 
retaining tongue portion (41), characterised in that each retaining 

tongue portion (41) is bent in the direction of said central zone and 
engaged in a slot (43) provided in said plate and delimited by a support 

edge (44) which resists extraction of said tongue portion (41) under the 
effect of a pulling force applied to the locking casing (18). 
An anchorage arrangement according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the retaining tongue portions (41) of the plate (20) extend through 

the slots (43) and bear against a spacer piece (23) for the purposes of 
locking said tongue portions in contact with the respective support edges 

(44) of said slots.
