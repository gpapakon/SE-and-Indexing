<ABSTRACT>
A toothbrush having a handle (71) and a bristle-bearing head (74). 
Between the 

handle (71) and the head (74) is a space (76) which crosses the 
boundary between the 

handle (71) and the head (74), and which contains an elastomeric 
material. The head or carrier (74) hence becomes resiliently and 

flexibly mounted relative to the handle (71).

<DESCRIPTION>
This patent application is a divisional application from PCT/EP 92/00645 -
92906554.8.The present invention relates to a novel article, being a toothbrush, and in
particular to a toothbrush having a flexibly linked zone in its head.When brushing one's teeth, particularly with a conventional toothbrush
having a rigid head, it can be difficult to reach all parts of the teeth in order to
brush the teeth satisfactorily. It is also difficult with such brushes to maintain an
optimum angle between the teeth and the head of the toothbrush for effective
brushing and cleaning, necessitating continual repositioning of the brush in the hand
throughout the brushing process. Consequently, there is a tendency to apply excess
brushing pressure to some teeth and insufficient pressure to other teeth. The
resultant combination of excess brushing pressure and inadequate cleaning or bad
cleaning technique can result in damage to both teeth and gums.Although angled-head toothbrushes have been suggested as an attempt to
overcome some of these difficulties, they do not satisfactorily meet all the
requirements.Proposals have also been made for toothbrushes having flexible handles or
flexible zones in their handles to assist in accommodating the orientation of the
bristle-bearing head of the brush to the profile of a user's teeth and gums. Such
toothbrushes are disclosed for example in EP-A-0336641 which discloses a
toothbrush having "S" folds in its handle, US 4520526, DE-OL-3640898 which
discloses a toothbrush having a thinned resilient neck, DE-OL-3612108,
CH-0155730 which discloses a toothbrush having cut-outs in its neck, and
IT-485123. DE 3923495 (=US 5054154) discloses a toothbrush having a handle in
which there are slots filled with an elastomeric material, these slots being in a part
of the handle distant from the head. US 4488328 discloses a toothbrush having its
head pivotally mounted between the arms of a yoke structure. US 4575894 discloses
a toothbrush in which a rubber pad is included in the head. US 4520526 discloses a
toothbrush in which the neck region is made more flexible by cut outs. US 759490
discloses a toothbrush with a flexible link between its head and handle.In some circumstances it is desirable to further improve the flexibility of the
head relative to the direction of the handle of the toothbrush.According to the present invention a toothbrush is provided according to
claim 1.The toothbrush head of this invention can move, particularly in a rocking
movement, relative to the handle and can thereby
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A toothbrush made of plastics material and having a handle (11) and a
bristle-bearing head (14) integrally joined thereto, the head (14) havin
g a base end
immediately adjacent to the handle (11), there being an aperture in the plastics

material of the head immediately adjacent to the handle (11), the head (14) and the
handle (11) being linked by a flexible resilient link between the head (14) and

handle (11); 
characterised
 in that the flexible link (13, 16) is in the form of a thin
spine (12) of plastics material integrally made with the head (14) and the handle

(11) and being located in the aperture (13) formed in the bristle bearing head (14)
and an elastomeric material fills the space between the spine (12) and the sides of

the aperture (13).
A toothbrush according to claim 1; 
characterised
 in that the flexible resilient
link (13, 16) is positioned at the junction between the end of the head (14) which

faces the handle (14) and the immediately adjacent part of the handle (11) such that
the head (14) is caused to rock relative to the immediately adjacent part of the

handle (14) upon application of pressure to the head (14).
A toothbrush according to claim 1 or 2 
characterised
 in that the aperture (13)
in the plastics material of the toothbrush, extends from the head (14) to the

immediately adjacent part of the handle (11).
A toothbrush according to claim 3, 
characterised
 in that the aperture (13)
extends across the whole width of the toothbrush handle (11) over at least part of

the length of the aperture (13).
A toothbrush according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised
 in
that the elastomeric material in the aperture (13) is a natural or synthetic latex type

elastomer.
