<ABSTRACT>
An awning (1, 100, 130) comprises an outer sheet (3, 101) of flexible material supported on a rigid translucent support (17, 102). The awning (1, 100, 130) is illuminated by strip lights (5) mounted on a support framework (2, 105), which is stepped back from the rigid translucent support (15, 102). An even illumination is achieved with no shadow lines on the flexible sheet (3, 101). The sheet (3, 101) may have advertising indicia or logos.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to canopies and in particular to an 
awning for positioning above retail and/or service 
locations such as shop fronts, automated bank teller 
machines and the like. Various awnings of this type are known, however, they are 
costly to install and maintain and in general are not 
particularly effective as advertising locations and in 
assisting and protecting customers. In particular the 
illumination of conventional awnings is generally uneven. The invention is directed towards providing an awning 
which will overcome at least some of these problems and in 
particular to providing an awning in which the 
illumination is substantially even. EP-A-0210872 describes an awning comprising sheet 
material, a support means for the sheet material and 
illumination means for illuminating the sheet material. According to the invention there is provided an awning 
comprising: 
a sheet material; a support means for the sheet material; and illumination means for illuminating the sheet 
material, wherein the support means is translucent. In one embodiment of the invention the illumination means 
is spaced rearwardly from the sheet material. Preferably 
the translucent support means comprises a substantially 
rigid support sheet of translucent material. The 
translucent support preferably conforms to at least 
portion of the desired shape of the sheet material. 
Typically the translucent support sheet is of at least 
partially arcuate shape.  
 In one embodiment of the invention the sheet support means 
is mounted to a framework. Preferably the framework 
comprises a lower support member and an upper support 
member to which the sheet support means is mounted. In a particularly preferred arrangement the illumination 
means is mounted to the framework. Preferably the 
framework includes illuminating support means extending 
between upper and lower support members. Typically the 
illuminating support means comprises at least two spaced-apart 
illuminating means support members which are stepped 
back from the sheet support means. In a preferred 
arrangement each illumination means support member extends 
from an upper support member to a lower support member. Preferably the upper support member is a rearward support 
member and the lower support member is a forward support 
member. In one arrangement the illuminating means is (are) 
supported on mounting clips provided on the illuminating 
means support members. Preferably the illuminating means comprises strip lights. Typically the awning includes
