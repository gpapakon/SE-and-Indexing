<ABSTRACT>
A moulded article, especially in the form of a fibreboard, based on wood and/or cellulose fibres, is characterised in that it contains  99 to 50% by weight of fibres and  1 to 50% by weight of a pretreated potato pulp, where the data in % by weight are based on dry matter, and the potato pulp is pretreated by the action of enzymes which influence the fibrous structure of the potato pulp, or the particles of the potato pulp have been reduced to an average size of less than 350  mu m by the pretreatment.

Moulded article, especially in the form of a fibre board, on the basis of wood 

and/or cellulose fibres,
characterized in that
 
it contains 


99 to 50 % by weight of fibres, and 
1 to 50 % by weight of a pre-treated potato pulp, 
with these weight percentages being related to the dry matter, and 
that the potato pulp is subjected to pre-treatment under the action of enzymes 
taking an influence on the fibrous structure of the potato pulp, or 
that the particles of the potato pulp were subjected to pre-treatment for comminution 
to a mean particle size of less than 350 µm. 
Moulded article according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
 that said enzymes consist 
of pectinases, hemicellulases and/or cellulases. 
Moulded article according to at least one of Claims 1 to 2, 
characterised in
 that 
the potato pulp in an aqueous suspension at a concentration of dry matter in the 

range from 2 to 25 % by weight was subjected to enzymatic treatment. 
Moulded article according to at least one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in
 that 
pectinase of 0.1 to 1000 U/g of potato pulp (TS) is used as enzyme. 
Moulded article according to at least one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in
 that it 
contains 


97 to 70 % by weight of fibres, and 
3 to 30 % by weight of pre-treated potato pulp. 
Moulded article according to at least one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in
 that it 
contains  

 

90 to 80 % by weight of fibres, and 
10 to 20 % by weight of pre-treated potato pulp. 
Moulded article according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
 that the potato pulp particles 
are previously subjected to comminution to a mean particle size of less than 

300 µm. 
Process for producing a moulded article according to at least one of Claims 1 to 
7, 
characterised in
 that 

the fibre is contacted with the pre-treated pulp by known methods such as dipping 
or spraying, 
a pre-drying step is performed, if necessary, to reduce the residual moisture down 
to less than 100 % by weight, 
the material is spread so as to form a mat, combed and subjected to pre-compression, 
if necessary, and 
is compressed under the action of heat and pressure so as to form a moulded article. 
Process according to Claim 8, 
characterised
 in that compression is performed at 
temperatures of 160 to 200 °C and under a pressure of 2.94 x 10
7
 Pa (30 kp/cm
2
). 
Process for pre-treating the utilised potato pulp, 
characterised in
 that a mechanical 
comminution is performed before and/or after the enzymatic treatment. 
Process according to Claim 10, 
characterised in
 that the mechanical comminution 
is performed in a mill or in a homogenizer. 
Process according to Claim 8, 
characterised in
 that pre-drying is performed for a 
reduction of the residual moisture down to less than 50 % by weight.
