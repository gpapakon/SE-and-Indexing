The dye-providing compounds are capable of releasing the coupler dye upon cleavage in the presence of silver ions or a soluble silver complex. The dye-providing compounds are useful as image-forming materials in color thermographic, photothermographic and other photographic processes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to image-forming
materials, specifically to dye-providing compounds
which, in the presence of silver ions and/or a soluble
silver complex, undergo a cleavage reaction to liberate
a diffusible coupler dye.U.S. Patent No. 3,719,489 discloses silver ion
assisted cleavage reactions useful in photographic
systems. As disclosed therein, photographically inert
compounds are capable of undergoing cleavage in the
presence of silver ions made available imagewise during
processing of a silver halide emulsion to liberate a
reagent, such as, a photographically active reagent or a
dye in an imagewise distribution corresponding to that
of said silver ions. In one embodiment disclosed
therein, color images are produced by using as the
photographically inert compounds, color-providing
compounds which are substantially non-diffusible in the
photographic processing composition but capable of
undergoing cleavage in the presence of the imagewise 
distribution of silver ions and/or soluble silver
complex made available in the undeveloped and partially
developed areas of a silver halide emulsion as a
function of development to liberate a more mobile and
diffusible color-providing moiety in an imagewise
distribution corresponding to the imagewise distribution
of said ions and/or said complex. The subsequent
formation of a color image is the result of the
differential in diffusibility between the parent
compound and liberated color-providing moiety whereby
the imagewise distribution of the more diffusible
color-providing moiety released in the undeveloped and
partially developed areas is free to transfer.Color-providing compounds useful in the above
process form the subject matter of U.S. Patent No.
4,098,783, a continuation in part of said U.S. Patent
No. 3,719,489. The color-providing compounds disclosed
therein may comprise one or more dye radicals and one or
more 1,3-sulfur-nitrogen moieties. For example, they
may comprise one complete dye or dye intermediate and
one cyclic 1,3-sulfur-nitrogen moiety. Alternatively,
the color-providing compounds may comprise two or more
cyclic moieties for each dye radical or dye intermediate
and vice versa. Particularly useful dye-providing
compounds disclosed therein comprise a dye containing
from 1 to 4 and preferably 1 or 2 cyclic 1,3-sulfur-nitrogen
groups and may be represented by the
formula
D-[(L)m-1-Y]n
wherein D represents a dye radical, i.e., the radical of
an organic dye possessing at least one carbon atom, L is
a divalent organic linking group containing
