<ABSTRACT>
A stick-shaped material propelling container (10) is comprised 
of a tubular body (12) provided with a spiral groove (18) in the inside 

thereof, a guide sleeve (14) inserted into the tubular body (12) that is 
not movable in an axial direction, but rotatable relative to the 

tubular body, and which is provided with guide grooves (20) extending 
in the axial direction. A holder (16) for holding stick-shaped 

material, is provided with projections (32) to engage the spiral 
groove, so that a stick-shaped material held in the holder can be 

selectively extended from or retracted into the stick-shaped 
material propelling container. The stick-shaped material 

propelling container further includes a slit (34) formed in the axial 
direction through a side wall portion of the holder where there 

are no projections.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stick-shaped material
propelling container in which a stick-shaped material
such as a stick-shaped eraser, a lip stick, a retouching
stick, a pencil lead, a fluorescent lead, stick-shaped
adhesive, an pastel and the like can be selectively
extended from and retracted into the stick-shaped material
propelling container by a turning operation, and in
particular to a stick-shaped material propelling container
which can be simply formed and can be easily and quickly
assembled.One example of a stick-shaped material propelling container
wherein a stick-shaped material can be selectively extended
from and retracted into the container, is a stick-shaped
material propelling container described in utility model
application laid open 19093 of 1991 (Heisei 3), corresponding
to U.S.Patent No.5,193,927 assigned to the same assignee
as this application.In the prior art example described in utility model
application laid open 19093 of 1991 (Heisei 3), short
slits are provided on a holder for holding a stick-shaped
material in order to make a projection of a holder 
easily engage with a guide groove on a guide sleeve
of the container. To assemble the stick-shaped material
propelling container, the holder projection engages
the guide groove by inserting the holder into the guide
sleeve from a head portion of the guide sleeve while
the holder is bent inward.However since the slits extend only over a part of the
holder, bending the holder is not sufficient to allow
the holder to be easily inserted into the guide sleeve.
Particularly in case of a holder with a small diameter,
insertion of the holder into the guide sleeve is very
difficult.Another example of a stick-shaped material propelling
container is disclosed in EP 0 321 581. As described
with respect to 19093 the slits to be found in
EP 0 321 581 only extend over part of the length of
the holder therefor not allowing the holder to easily bend
enough inwardly for insertion. Moreover purpose of these
slits is only to allow bending slightly inwardly for
protection of the device against further rotation and
thereby damaging of the holder when alreacy in one of
its end positions.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
stick-shaped material propelling container in which a holder can
bend sufficiently to allow assembly thereof to be carried out
easily and quickly.In order to achieve the object, a stick-shaped material
propelling container according to the present invention comprises
a tubular body provided with a spiral groove

<CLAIMS>
A stick-shaped material (36) propelling container (10)
comprising


a tubular body (12) provided with a spiral groove (18)
in an inside thereof,
a guide sleeve (14) having a guide groove (20) extending
in an axial direction, said guide sleeve (14) being

inserted into the tubular body (12), and being not movable
in an axial direction, but being rotatable relative

to the tubular body (12), and
a holder (16) for holding a stick-shaped material (36),
having at least one projection (32) to engage the spiral

groove (18);
so that the stick-shaped material (36) held in the holder
(16) being selectively extended from or retracted into

the stick-shaped material (36) propelling container
(10), said stick-shaped material (36) propelling container

(10) further comprising a slit (34) formed in the axial
direction through a side wall portion of the holder

(16) where there are no projections (32), the slit (34)
extending along the whole length of the side wall portion from a front

end to a rear end of the holder (16).
A stick-shaped material (36) propelling container (10)
as claimed in claim 1, including a ring (22) for covering

the top of the guide sleeve (14) provided at the top
of the guide sleeve (14).
A stick-shaped material (36) propelling container (10)
comprising


a tubular body (12) having a spiral groove (18) on an
interior surface thereof, 
a guide sleeve (14) inserted into said tubular body
(12), said guide sleeve (14) having an axially extending

guide groove (20) means;
means (22,24') preventing said guide sleeve (14) from
axial movement while allowing rotational movement in

said tubular body (12);
holding means (16,30,40) for holding a stick-shaped
material (36); said holding means (16;40) having at

least one projection (32,46) for engaging said spiral
groove (18) through said guide groove (20) in said guide

sleeve (14);
said holding means (16;40) having a tubular body (28,30;42,44)
with an axial slit (34;48) extending along the whole length of the

tubular body from a front end
to a rear end of the body (28,30;42,44) to allow said

holding means (16,30) to bend radially inward;
whereby said holding means (16,30) may bend inwardly
to fit into said guide means (20) with said at least

one projection (32;46) engaging said spiral groove
(18) so that a stick-shaped material (36) in said holding

means (16) may be selectively extended from or retracted
into said tubular body (12).
The propelling container according to claim 3 including
a ring shaped cap means (22) secured at the top end

of said guide sleeve (14).
The propelling container according to claim 3, wherein
said axial slit (34) in said holding means (16) has 

a width (W) that at least equals the height of said
at least one projection (32).
The propelling container according to claim 5 in which
said at least one projection (32) comprises two projections

(32) on opposite sides of said holding means (16).
