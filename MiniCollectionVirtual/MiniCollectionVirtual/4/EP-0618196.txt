<DESCRIPTION>
Stereoselective and stereospecific routes for the 
synthesis of pharmaceutically-active compounds are 
continually in demand. The pharmaceutical activity of a 
particular chemical compound often resides in one isomer. 
See Laird, Chem. Ind (London), 366 (1989); Powel, Ambre, 
and Ruo, Drug Chemistry, 245-270 (1988); Borman, Chem,Eng. News,68, 9 (July 9, 1990); and Camp, Chirality,1, 2 
(1989). An efficient synthesis of the active isomer, 
therefore, requires a route that is stereoselective or 
stereospecific. Natural products are frequently used in the synthesis 
of pharmaceutically-active compounds. Hanessian, Total 
Synthesis of Natural Product: The "Chiron" 
Approach, ix (1983); Asymmetric Synthesis, Vol. 4, 
Chapter 1 (1984); and Coppola and Schuster, Asymmetric 
Synthesis (1987). Generally, natural products have a 
defined stereochemical configuration that can be used in 
the synthesis of complex compounds, or that can be used to 
influence the stereochemical outcome of synthetic 
transformations. Morrison and Mosher, Asymmetric 
Organic Reactions (1976). One group of natural products that have demonstrated a 
utility in organic synthesis is the cinchona alkaloids. 
This group includes such compounds as quinine, quinidine, 
cinchonidine, and cinchonine. Uskokovic et al. has 
described a process for the conversion of cinchonine into a 
1:2.4 mixture of cis and trans-hexahydroisoquinolones, 
respectively. Uskokovic et al., Helv. Chim. Acta, 56, 
2834-2844 (1973). This mixture of cis and trans isomers 
was separated and reduced to prepare optically pure  
 
(4aS,8aR) and (4aS,8aS)-octahydroisoquinolones. A 
stereospecific or a more stereoselective route for the 
synthesis of hexahydroisoquinolones would be useful for the 
synthesis of pharmaceutically-active compounds. A recent report shows that a series of 6-substituted 
decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acids act as 
competitive NMDA receptor antagonists and are suitable for 
use as neuroprotective agents in a variety of acute and 
chronic neurodegenerative disorders. Ornstein et al., J.Med. Chem.,35, 3547-3560 (1992). One compound from this 
series, (±)-(3SR,4aRS,6SR,8aRS)-6-(phosphonomethyl)-decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic 
acid, is a very potent 
and selective neuroprotective agent against excessive NMDA 
receptor activation in vivo in rats and in mice. Schoepp, 
Ornstein, Salhoff, and Leander, J. Neural Transm.,85, 
131-143 (1991). This compound effectively blocks NMDA-induced 
convulsions in neonatal rats. This compound also 
provides
