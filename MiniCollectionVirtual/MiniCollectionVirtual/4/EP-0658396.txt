<ABSTRACT>
A welding austenitic steel material is selected from 
among 18 Cr-8 Ni austenitic stainless steel, Mo containing 18 

Cr-8 Ni austenitic stainless steel and 18 Cr-8 Ni austenitic 
stainless steel containing either Nb or Ti or both, 

characterized in that the permissible content of Si as an 
incidental impurity is restricted to no more than 0.1%.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to welding austenitic 
stainless steel materials that are sufficiently resistant to 
hydrogen embrittlement so that they will undergo only limited 
hydrogen embrittlement even if they are used in oil refining 
and other sectors of chemical industry where exposure to 
hydrogen occurs very frequently. Weld overlay metals comprising austenitic stainless 
steels that are used in oil refining and other sectors of 
chemical industry are so set for composition and welding 
conditions that δ-ferrite is deliberately contained in amounts 
of 3 to 10% with a view to preventing hot cracking. The upper 
limit is specified at 10% in consideration of two facts: the 
ductility of the austenitic stainless steels decrease with the 
increasing content of the δ-ferrite, and it drops further in 
the presence of hydrogen absorbed during the operation ofe 
equipment. After the weld overlay of the δ-ferrite containing 
austenitic stainless steels, a heat treatment is given in order 
to soften the heat-affected zone of the base metal and to  
 
reduce the residual stress in it. However, if 3% or more of 
the δ-ferrite content transforms to the sigma-phase during the 
post heat treatment, the ductility of the austenitic stainless 
steel with hydrogen retained in it will drop so markedly as to 
cause hydrogen embrittlement and cracking is initiated in 
internal attachments, gasket grooves and other areas where the 
stress is concentrated. To deal with this problem, various methods have been 
attempted, such as by increasing the radii of corners in the 
stress-concentrated areas so as to disperse the latter or by 
omitting the heat treatment that is conventionally conducted 
after overlay the final weld metal layer. However, these prior 
art methods have a serious limitation in that the working 
schedule is prolonged to lower the operational efficiency. The present invention has been accomplished under these 
circumstances and has as the primary object providing a welding 
austenitic stainless steel material that has its resistance to 
hydrogen embrittlement improved by suppressing the 
transformation to the sigma-phase in the steel material. The present invention attains the above-stated object 
by welding austenitic stainless steel material that contains, 
on a weight basis, up to 0.12% C, 1 to 2.5 % Mn, 9 to 15% Ni 
and 18 to 25% Cr, with the balance being Fe and incidental  
 
impurities. The permissible content of Si as an incidental 
impurity is restricted to no more than 0.1%. In one
