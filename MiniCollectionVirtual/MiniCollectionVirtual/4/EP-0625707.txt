<ABSTRACT>
Method for lysing erythrocytes and for protecting the leucocytes in a blood sample, characterised in that a blood sample previously treated with an anticoagulant is treated with an aqueous composition having an essentially physiological ionic value comprising a mixture of     - an aliphatic aldehyde,   - a polyhydric alcohol and, - a salt of a strong acid and of an alkali or alkaline-earth metal, composition for lysing erythrocytes, blood composition treated and method for analysing leucocyte populations.

Method of lysing erythrocytes and of protecting leukocytes of a blood
sample characterized in that a sample of blood which has been pretreated with an

anticoagulant, is treated with an aqueous composition having an ionic strength which is
approximately physiological containing a mixture


of an aliphatic aldehyde,
of a polyhydric alcohol and,
of a salt of a strong acid and an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the sample is
treated with an antibody specific for at least one subpopulation of lymphocytes before

the treatment with the aqueous preparation having an ionic strength which is
approximately physiological.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the aqueous
preparation having an ionic strength which is approximately physiological also contains

an aliphatic alcohol.
A composition for lysing erythrocytes, characterized in that it is an
aqueous preparation having an ionic strength which is approximately physiological

containing a mixture

of an aliphatic aldehyde,
of a polyhydric alcohol and,
of a salt of a strong acid and an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal.
A composition according to claim 4, characterized in that:

the aliphatic aldehyde is formaldehyde,
the polyhydric alcohol is glycerol
A composition according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the salt
of a strong acid and of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal is a perchlorate.
A composition according to any one of claims 4 to 6, characterized in
that it also contains an aliphatic alcohol.
A composition according to any one of claims 4 to 7, characterized in
that it contains a small quantity of at least one alkaline earth metal chosen form

magnesium and calcium. 
A composition of blood treated with an anticoagulant and lysed,
characterized in that it contains a mixture of a sample of blood treated with an

anticoagulant and with an aqueous composition having an ionic strength which is
approximately physiological containing a mixture


of an aliphatic aldehyde,
of a polyhydric alcohol and,
of a salt of a strong acid and an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal.
A method of analyzing leukocyte populations of a blood sample in
which a blood sample is treated with an anticoagulant, then, if desired, using at least

one antibody specific for a leukocyte population or subpopulation, then using an
erythrocyte lysing agent characterized in that after treatment using the anticoagulant

and, if desired, using at least one labelled antibody, the sample is treated using an
aqueous preparation having an ionic strength which is approximately physiological

containing:

an aliphatic aldehyde,
a polyhydric alcohol and,
a salt of a strong acid and an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal then cytometric
analysis of said sample is carried out.
