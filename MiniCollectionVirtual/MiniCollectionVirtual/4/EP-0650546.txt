<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a lead-through structure for a wall, said structure comprising two frame like parts interconnecting from each side of said wall, a first male part (10) comprising a set of locking tongues (11, 11A) extending from a circumferential plane oriented in the general direction of said wall towards said wall and extending in the direction of corresponding edges of said frame, said locking tongues (11, 11A) interacting with counter slots located, recessed against said wall, in a female second part (1) and being directed in the direction of said edge of said frame. Each locking tongue (11, 11A) comprises at least one locking claw (17) extending essentially in the direction of a corresponding edging (3) of said frame, said claw (17) extending from the side surface of said tongue. Each counter slot (6) comprises at least one counter shoulder (7) co-operating with said locking claw (17), said counter shoulder (7) also extending in the direction of said corresponding edging (3) of said frame. The invention is especially useful as a window framing in walls or the like having a sandwich structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lead-through structure for 
a wall, 
according to the preamble of claim 1. Such lead-through structures are known especially in integrated 
window and door structures, where two part frame like 
edge structures manufactured from metal or plastic are pushed 
against each other during installation at an opening made in 
said wall, and frame parts located on opposite sides of said 
wall 1 becoming interlocked by respective locking elements, to 
form a lead-through structure, at least to one of said frames 
often being associated with an integral window or the like 
structure to be mounted in said wall. The advantage of integral structures to be interconnected by 
pushing from both sides of a wall primarily resides in providing 
a simple and quick installation. Same parts will often 
fit, with respect to their locking mechanism, to walls, the 
thickness of which may sometimes vary. International patent application WO 90/12187 discloses a structure 
of the kind described, said structure having a tooth 
system on the short sides of longish flat locking tongues. 
Such a structure may be preferable to manufacture, but the  
 
grip of locking toothing engaging at a very narrow area is 
weak, and thus the structure may be easily broken up, so that 
a burglar may have access through said wall via said opening. The above mentioned problems are solved by the characterizing features stated in claim 1. In order to improve the security against burglary and the 
versatility of the structure the inventive structure has been 
developed, the characterizing features of which will be evident 
from the appended claims. Thus the invention is characterized 
by each locking tongue comprising at least one locking 
claw extending essentially in the direction of the corresponding 
edging of said frame, said claw extending from the 
side surface of said tongue and generally in the direction of 
the plane of said wall, and by each counteracting slot or 
notch comprising a counter shoulder co-operating with said 
locking claw, said counter shoulder also extending in the 
direction of said corresponding edging of said frame. The invention will now be described in more detail and with 
reference to the appended drawing, where 
Figure 1shows the general arrangement of a structure 
according to the invention, and Figure 2shows, in an enlarged scale, details of Figure 1 and 
partially in section how a tongue according to the 
invention will co-operate with a corresponding oblong 
slot or notch. In Fig 1

<CLAIMS>
A lead-through structure for a wall, which 
arrangement comprises two integral frame like parts (1, 10) 

manufactured in one piece, respectively, and interconnecting 
from both sides of said wall structure, a first male part (10) 

of said arrangement comprising, at each frame section 
respectively, a set of successively arranged separate locking 

tongues (11, 11A) extending in a mutually spaced relationship 
in the direction of the respective corresponding one of said 

frame sections and generally directed towards correspondingly 
arranged respective counter slots (6) located at a generally 

female second part (1) of said arrangement, said counter slots 
(6) being defined within a beam like supporting structure (5) 

arranged at the outermost portion of an edging (3) arranged at 
said female second part (1) and extending into an opening made 

in said wall structure, said counter slots (6) comprising a 
counter shoulder (7) arranged for co-operation with a locking 

claw (17) arranged at the side surface of a respective locking 
tongue (11, 11A), said beam like supporting structure (5) 

comprising beam edge skirts (4, 8) extending generally in the 
direction of said edging (3) as well as reinforcing 

intermediate walls interconnecting said beam edge skirts (4, 
8), said skirts and walls together defining between them said 

counter slots (6), 
characterized
 in that each 
separate counter shoulder (7) is arranged at that beam edge 

skirt (4) of said beam like supporting structure (5), which 
skirt (4) is located towards the center of said opening made 

in the wall structure and simultaneously towards said edging 
(3) of said female second part (1), and the opposite beam edge 

skirt (8) is arranged, at the location of said counter slot 
(6), to resiliently support the opposite side surface of a 

locking tongue (11, 11A) pressed into said counter slot 
(6), with respect to said locking claw (17).  

 
A structure according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that several locking claws (17) are arranged successively, 

as seen in an attachment direction extending from the flange 
plane of said frame part (10) in a direction towards the edge 

(21) of said tongue (11, 11A). 
A structure according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that the flank surface (20) of said locking claw 
(17) at each locking tongue (11, 11A) of a first frame like 

part (10), which flank surface during installation is movable 
against a second frame like part (1), and/or a flank surface 

of a counter shoulder (7) correspondingly co-operating therewith, 
is inclined, preferably so that each locking tongue (11,

A structure according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized
 in that the section of said locking tongue 
(11, 11A) in a transverse direction, with respect to the 

edging (3) of said frame, is at least to some portions slightly 
wedge-like so that a tongue (11, 11A) entering, with its  

 
narrower front tip (21), into said counter slot (6) will be 

wedged with its locking claw (17) against a counter shoulder 
(7) or shoulders of said counter slot (6), and correspondingly 

against a suitably slightly resilient outer exaction surface
