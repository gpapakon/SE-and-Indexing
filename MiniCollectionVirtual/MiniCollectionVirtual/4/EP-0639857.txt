<ABSTRACT>
An easily reworkable circuit module is provided that allows 
unusable electronic components that have been encapsulated to be removed 

from a printed circuit board. Direct chip attach methods (DCA), such as 
C4 or SBC techniques, used to attach a chip or MCM to a carrier leave a 

space between the chip/MCM and carrier, due to the height of the solder 
balls, connection pads and the like. In preferred embodiments of the 

present invention a non-stick release coating (9) is placed on all 
surfaces 

intermediate of the chip (1) and carrier (3). That is, the release 
coating (9) of 

the present invention is placed by spraying, or the like, 
between the 

chip (1) and carrier (3) to form a thin film which inhibits the 
adhesion of a 

subsequently applied and cured rigid polymer encapsulant (11). 
Thus, when a 

chip or MCM tests as "bad", rework is a relatively simple matter. The 
solder connections (7) between the chip and carrier of the module are 

reflowed and the chip (1) is lifted off. The solder reflow temperature 
will 

be below the melting point of the encapsulant (11), and since the 
encapsulant (11) 

did not stick to the chip (1) or carrier (3), it can be merely wiped 
away with a 

dry cloth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to techniques for reworking carriers 
such as printed circuit boards (PCB) having either individual 
semiconductor devices (chips or ICs) or modules, including single chip or 
multichip, soldered thereon. Encapsulation of chips and multichip modules (MCMs) using a polymer 
type material is currently known in the art. One reason for 
encapsulating integrated circuit devices is to seal the input/output 
points of the chips from external contaminants. Additionally, a rigid 
polymer material will provide support to the chip or module relative to 
the substrate, or PWB that is the carrier. Generally, chips and MCMs 
have a different coefficient of thermal expansion when compared to the 
carrier on which they are affixed. Therefore, these materials will not 
exhibit the same characteristics when they are heated to operating 
temperatures inside a computer system. Thus, mismatch in the thermal 
coefficient of expansion (TCE) normally exists between chips and/or MCMs 
and the carrier substrate on which they are placed. This inconsistent 
TCE means that the chip and/or MCM will expand at a different rate per 
degree increase in temperature than the carrier, thereby causing stress 
on the I/Os connecting the chips and carrier. Conventional solutions to 
this problem include placing an encapsulant material between the chip 
and/or carrier which mechanically bonds the chip to the carrier, which 
relieves some of the stress caused by the expansion. Those skilled in the art will understand that a substantial number 
of chips, MCMs, and other electronic components that are placed on 
substrate carriers for use in computer systems, or the like, do not pass 
the test phase of manufacturing. In these cases the chips must be 
removed from the carrier and replaced with other ICs that were tested as 
good. This replacement is commonly referred to as "rework" wherein the 
bad chips are replaced with good ones and the system is tested again. It 
is cost effective and efficient, from a manufacturing standpoint, to test 
the chips and/or MCMs prior to their encapsulation to avoid rework 
whenever possible, since it is a costly and time consuming process. 
However, even with testing, a substantial number of components must still 
be reworked. Therefore, minimizing the amount of time and effort  
 
required to rework a carrier is a serious consideration to the computer 
industry. Conventional systems place a single material intermediate of the 
chip and carrier. For example, U.S. 5,086,558 places an
