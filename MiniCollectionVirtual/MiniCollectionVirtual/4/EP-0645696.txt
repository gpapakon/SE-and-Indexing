<ABSTRACT>
A FIFO memory device using a serial pointer consists of first and second 
memory cell arrays (MCA1, MCA2), a row decoder (RD) for selecting a word line, 

first and second write registers (WR1, WR2) for storing data, each write register 
consisting of registers, and a serial write pointer (SWP1, SWP2) for serially 

selecting each register. The serial write pointer (SWP1, SWP2) consists of pointers 
corresopnding to the first and second write registers. The row decoder (RD) is 

located between the first memory cell array and the second memory cell array. In 
the device, in adjacent registers in each write register, the shift direction of one 

register indicated by said serial write pointer is opposed to the shift direction of the 
other register.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device using a 
serial pointer such as a First In First Out (FIFO) semiconductor memory 
device, a field memory and the like, and, in particular, to a semiconductor 
memory device being capable of asynchronous high speed write-in and 
read-out during serial input and output of data to memory elements of the 
semiconductor memory device using a serial pointer. Among memories in which data is write in to and read out from a 
memory cell serially, such as First In First Out (FIFO) memories and field 
memories, a serial pointer is used to count column addresses, one address at a 
time, in synchronism with an external serial clock signal, to select a column. FIG.1 is a configuration drawing of a conventional First In First Out 
(FIFO) semiconductor memory device provided with a column of N bits. FIG.2 is a diagram for explaining the operation of a conventional serial 
pointer including a required number of pointers used for the conventional 
FIFO memory device shown in Fig.1. First, an operation for writing data into memory cells will be explained. Each of data input transferred from an external device has a value of 
digital "1" ("H" level) or digital "0" ("L" level) in an input buffer (not shown). 
These data are transferred to write-data lines (not shown), and data from a 
column address 1 to a column address N/2 are serially received in sequence to 
a first write register WR1 based on the serial write pointers. When data have been received to all the bits of the first write register 
WR1, a word line for selecting the row direction of a memory cell array is 
selected by a row decoder RD controlled by an internal circuit in the FIFO 
semiconductor memory device (chip), and the data in the first write register 
WR1 is written into a first memory cell array MCA1 through a first write 
transfer gate WT1.  Simultaneously, data from an address (N/2) + 1 to an address N are 
serially transferred in sequence to a second write register WR2. When the 
data have been received to all the bits of the second write register WR2, the 
data in the second write register WR2 are written into a second memory cell 
array MCA2 through a second write transfer gate WT2, and the word line 
selection is completed. The position of a serial write pointer (SWP) for selecting the N address 
register bit returns back to the position for selecting the first address register 
bit, and the above-mentioned operation is repeated so that the operation of 
writing to the memory cell is
