<ABSTRACT>
Silver halide color photographic light-sensitive material which comprises a 
support having thereon at least one silver halide emulsion layer containing a) an 

alkoxybenzoylacetanilide DIR coupler having bonded to the coupling active position 
a group which provides a compound having a development inhibiting property 

when the group is released from the coupler active position upon the color 
development reaction, wherein said group is a 4,7-dihalogen-2-benzotriazolyl 

group 
and b) an alkoxybenzoylacetanilide yellow dye forming coupler having a 3-hydantoinyl 

leaving group bonded to the coupling active position to provide, upon 
exposure and development, color images of improved image sensitivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide color photographic
light-sensitive material containing a DIR (Development Inhibitor Releasing) coupler
and a yellow dye forming coupler.It is well known that color photographic light-sensitive materials using the
substractive process for color reproduction comprise silver halide emulsion layers
selectively sensitive to blue, green and red light and associated with yellow, magenta
and cyan dye forming couplers which form (upon reaction with an oxidized
primary amine type color developing agent) the complementary color thereof. For
example, an acylacetanilide or a pivaloylacetanilide type coupler is used to form a
yellow color image; a pyrazolone, pyrazolotriazole, cyanacetophenone or indazolone
type coupler is used to form a magenta color image; and a phenol type coupler,
such as a phenol or naphthol coupler, is used to form a cyan color image.In general, yellow color forming couplers have chemical structures in which
one hydrogen atom of the active methylene group is substituted with a releasable
atom or group. Examples of such releasable atoms or groups are a fluorine atom
as described in US Patent No. 3,277,155, a phenoxy group as described in US
Patent No. 3,408,194, an acyloxy group as described in US Patent No. 3,447,928,
a sulfoxy group as described in US Patent No. 3,415,652, a group having a
saccharin structure as described in US Patent No. 3,730,722 and a hydantoinyl
group as described in US Patent Nos. 3,973,968; 4,022,620; 4,404,274; 4,777,123.It is also known to incorporate into a light sensitive color photographic
material a compound capable of releasing a development inhibitor during development
upon reaction with the oxidation product of a color developing agent. Typical
examples of said compounds are the DIR (Development Inhibitor Releasing) couplers
having a group having a development inhibiting property when released from
the coupler introduced at the coupling position of the coupler. Examples of DIR 
couplers are described by C.R. Barr, J.R. Thirtle and P.W. Wittum, Photographic
Science and Eng., vol. 13. pp 74-80(1969) and ibid. pp 214-217 (1969) or in US
Pat. Nos. 3,227,554, 3,615,506, 3,617,291, 3,701,783, 3,933,500, and 4,149,886.The purpose of DIR couplers is to reduce graininess and improve sharpness
of the image due to intralayer or intraimage effects (that is in the same layers
or the same dye image) and improve color reproduction due to interlayer or interimage
effects (that is in different layers or different dye images).Among
