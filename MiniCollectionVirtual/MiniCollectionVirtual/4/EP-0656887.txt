<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to retroviral
protease inhibitors and, more particularly, relates to
novel compounds and a composition and method for
inhibiting retroviral proteases. This invention, in
particular, relates to sulfonamide-containing
hydroxyethylamine protease inhibitor compounds, a
composition and method for inhibiting retroviral
proteases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
protease and for treating a retroviral infection, e.g.,
an HIV infection. The subject invention also relates to
processes for making such compounds as well as to
intermediates useful in such processes.During the replication cycle of retroviruses,
gag and gag-pol gene products are translated as proteins.
These proteins are subsequently processed by a virally
encoded protease (or proteinase) to yield viral enzymes
and structural proteins of the virus core. Most
commonly, the gag precursor proteins are processed into
the core proteins and the pol precursor proteins are
processed into the viral enzymes, e.g., reverse
transcriptase and retroviral protease. It has been shown
that correct processing of the precursor proteins by the
retroviral protease is necessary for assembly of
infectious virons. For example, it has been shown that
frameshift mutations in the protease region of the pol 
gene of HIV prevents processing of the gag precursor
protein. It has also been shown through site-directed
mutagenesis of an aspartic acid residue in the HIV
protease that processing of the gag precursor protein is
prevented. Thus, attempts have been made to inhibit
viral replication by inhibiting the action of retroviral
proteases.Retroviral protease inhibition may involve a
transition-state mimetic whereby the retroviral protease
is exposed to a mimetic compound which binds to the
enzyme in competition with the gag and gag-pol proteins
to thereby inhibit replication of structural proteins
and, more importantly, the retroviral protease itself.
In this manner, retroviral replication proteases can be
effectively inhibited.Several classes of compounds have been
proposed, particularly for inhibition of proteases, such
as for inhibition of HIV protease. Such compounds
include hydroxyethylamine isosteres and reduced amide
isosteres. See, for example, EP O 346 847; EP O 342,541;

Proteinase Inhibitors, "Science, 248, 358 (1990); and
