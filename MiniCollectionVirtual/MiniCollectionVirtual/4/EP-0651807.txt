<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to new sequences of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes and their use as therapeutic and diagnostic agents.The present invention relates to new nucleotide and amino acid sequences corresponding to the coding region of type-specific sequences corresponding to HCV type 3a, a process for preparing them, and their use for diagnosis, prophylaxis and therapy.The technical problem underlying the present invention is to provide new type-specific sequences of the Core and the E1 regions of HCV type 3a. These new HCV sequences are useful to diagnose the presence of type 3a HCV genotypes in a biological sample. Moreover, the availability of these new type-specific sequences can increase the overall sensitivity of HCV detection and should also prove to be useful for therapeutic purposes.Hepatitis C viruses (HCV) have been found to be the major cause of non-A, non-B-hepatitis. The sequences of cDNA clones covering the complete genome of several prototype isolates have been determined (Kato et al., 1990; Choo et al., 1991; Okamoto et al., 1991; Okamoto et al., 1992). Comparison of these isolates shows that the variability in nucleotide sequences can be used to distinguish at least 2 different genotypes, type 1 (HCV-1 and HCV-J) and type 2 (HC-J6 and HC-J8), with an average homology of about 68%. Within each type, at least two subtypes exist (e.g. represented by HCV-1 and HCV-J), having an average homology of about 79%. HCV genomes belonging to the same subtype show average homologies of more than 90% (Okamoto et al., 1992). However, the partial nucleotide sequence of the NS5 region of the HCV-T isolates showed at most 67% homology with the previously published sequences, indicating the existence of a yet another HCV type (Mori et al., 1992). Parts of the 5' untranslated region (UR), core, NS3, and NS5 regions of this type 3 have been published, further establishing the similar evolutionary distances between the 3 major genotypes and their subtypes (Chan et al., 1992).The identification of type 3a genotypes in clinical samples can be achieved by means of PCR with type-specific primers for the NS5 region. However, the degree to which this will be successful is largely dependent on sequence variability and on the virus titer present in the serum. Therefore, routine PCR in the open reading frame, especially for type 3a described in the present invention and/or group V (Cha et al., 1992) genotypes can be predicted to be unsuccessful. A new typing system (LiPA), based on variation in the highly
