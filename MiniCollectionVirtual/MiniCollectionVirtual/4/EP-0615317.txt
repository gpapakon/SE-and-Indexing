<ABSTRACT>
An electric cable guiding device comprises a 
fixed guide block (21) and a movable guide block (22). 

A projected rounded surface (211a) is formed on the 
fixed guide block (21), and an indented or recessed 

rounded surface (221) is formed in the movable guide 
block (22). In addition, a groove (221a) is formed in 

the indented rounded surface (221). At the time of 
guiding an electric cable, the movable guide block 

(22) is fitted in the fixed guide block (21). In this 
state, the indented rounded surface (211a) and the 

groove (221a) constitute an electric cable guide path 
(R1). The electric cable (W) is fed into the electric 

cable guide path (R1) by rollers (331,332,341 and 
342). Consequently, the electric cable (W) is guided 

in a U shape along the electric cable guide path (R1). 
The front end of the electric cable drawn out of the 

electric cable guide path (R1) is clamped by a clamp 
(42). Thereafter, the movable guide block (22) is 

moved to an electric cable measuring position spaced 
apart from the fixed guide block (21) by a 

predetermined distance. In this state, the electric 
cable (W) is fed by a required length. The rear end 

of the electric cable is clamped by a guide clamp (41) 
and then is cut.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to-an electric cable
guiding device for guiding an electric cable in a U shape in
measuring the electric cable and cutting the same to
predetermined lengths in the manufacturing processes of a
wiring harness.A wiring harness mounted on an automobile or the like
is characterized in that it is constructed by assembling a
plurality of electric cables cut to predetermined lengths,
has flexibility, has a long narrow shape and has a
complicatedly branched structure. The manufacturing
processes of the wiring harness include a measuring and
cutting process for measuring the length of the electric
cable and cutting the electric cable to predetermined
lengths, a stripping process for stripping an end of the
electric cable cut to predetermined lengths, a terminal
crimping process for crimping a terminal on a conductor at
the end of the electric cable exposed by the stripping process, a
terminal inserting process for inserting the terminal
crimped on the conductor at the end of the electric cable
into a connector housing, an assembling process for
assembling a plurality of electric cables mounted on the 
connector housing, and the like.The respective manufacturing processes of the wiring
harness have been automated due to rationalization such as
decreases in manufacturing time and manufacturing cost of
the wiring harness. Therefore, each electric cable
processing station for performing measuring and cutting,
stripping and terminal crimping operations is provided with
a measuring and cutting apparatus 1, a stripping apparatus 2
and terminal crimping apparatuses 3, 4 and 5 for
automatically performing the operations, as shown in Fig. 4 of the accompanying drawings.In the measuring and cutting apparatus 1, the electric
cable W must be guided in a U shape, measured and cut to
predetermined lengths, and sent to the subsequent stripping
apparatus 2 after clamping both ends of the electric cable W,
measured and cut. Accordingly, the measuring and cutting
apparatus has been conventionally provided with an electric
cable guiding device for guiding the electric cable W in a U
shape.This type of electric cable guiding device is disclosed
in, for example, Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 5424/1989
and 5425/1989. In this electric cable guiding device, the
front end of the electric cable W fed from a nozzle 13 is
clamped by one clamp 14, as shown in Fig.5 of the accompanying drawings. Thereafter, a
reversely rotating member 15 is rotated through an angle of
180° in a direction indicated by an arrow
