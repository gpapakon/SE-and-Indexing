<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for 
evaluating speech quality in speech synthesizers with the 

aid of a speech recognition system. The recognition 
system is programmed using a number of persons. It then 

receives synthetic or natural speech from speech synthesizers 
or persons respectively, displaying differing 

speech quality. The speech recognition system determines 
a level of recognition for each received speech quality. 

In order to evaluate the speech quality in a speech 
synthesizer, speech is received from the synthesizer by 

the speech recognition system, is allocated a level of 
recognition and is ranked in comparison to the levels of 

recognition for previously received speech.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
evaluating speech quality in speech synthesis. More
specifically, the invention is intended for use in
equipment which is capable of receiving and analyzing
speech messages, especially from speech synthesizers,
i.e. text-to-speech converters. With the aid of the
invention, the level of recognition of received speech in
a speech recognition system can be ranked in terms of
quality.Speech recognition and text-to-speech conversion
are techniques which are known per se.U.S. 5.127.055 relates to speech recognition. A
large number of references, representing vocal expression,
are stored. Each reference has an associated
quality value representing the effectiveness with which
an incoming vocal expression is recognized. The user can
make corrections, which represent the accuracy in the
speech recognition. The quality values are updated.U.S. 4.692.941 describes a known technique for
text-to-speech conversion.The present invention solves, in a new way, the
problem of analyzing speech quality in a speech synthesizer.Present invention is defined of patent Claim 1.The present invention thus provides a synthezised speech quality evaluation process for
analyzing speech quality in speech synthesis. According
to the invention, a speech recognition system is trained using speech from
a number of persons. The speech recognition
system then receives synthetic or natural speech from
speech synthesizers and persons respectively, displaying
differing speech quality, and determines a level of
recognition for each received speech quality. The speech
quality for the speech synthesizer to be evaluated is
determined by receiving speech from the speech
synthesizer, determining its level of recognition and 
ranking the synthesizer in comparison with the levels of
recognition for previously received speech speech syntesizers and persons.The invention is defined in the following patent
claims.The invention is intended for application in
speech recognition systems which are to receive and
analyze speech messages, especially from speech synthesizers.A speech recognition system must first be programmed
to be able to recognize speech. Speech from a
number of persons is used to teach the speech recognition
system to recognize speech. The level of recognition for
the speech from the programming group is consequently
100 %. When the speech recognition system is then used
with general speech, it is able to understand the
received speech to a very high degree.In order to assign a quality measure

<CLAIMS>
Synthesized speech quality evaluation process, characterized
in that a speech recognition system is trained

using speech from a number of persons, in that the
speech recognition system receives synthetic or natural

speech from speech synthesizers and persons respectively,
displaying differing speech quality, in that the

speech recognition system determines a level of recognition
for each received speech quality, in that speech

from a speech synthesizer to be evaluated is received by
the speech recognition system, is allocated a level of

recognition and is ranked in comparison with the levels
of recognition of previously received speech from said

speech synthesizers and persons.
