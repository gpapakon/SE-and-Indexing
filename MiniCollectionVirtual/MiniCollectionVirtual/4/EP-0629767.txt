<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a wooden door and window frame, having a leaf-frame/sash-frame member (10) from whose end surface (10'), directed towards the outer-frame member (11), there projects a frame overhang (13) which covers the gap between the two frames. In order to improve the secureness of such wooden frames against break-in, they are designed such that a member (10) of a wooden door leaf or window sash is provided, in the hinge region, on both sides with in each case one hinge reinforcement plate (33, 34), said plates being screwed together from the inner side of the leaf/sash.

<CLAIMS>
Wooden door or window leaf frame, comprising a leaf frame spar (10) which
in a hinge region adjacent to a blind frame spar (11) is provided on both sides

with a respective hinge reinforcement plate (33, 34) which are screwed together
from the inner side of the leaf, characterised in that a frame cover (13) which

covers a gap (64) with respect to the blind frame spar (11) protrudes from an end
face (10') of the leaf frame spar (10) and is covered by the one hinge

reinforcement plate (34) as far as the end face (10') of the leaf frame spar (10), in
that the second hinge reinforcement plate (33) extends as far as the end face

(10') of the leaf frame spar (10), and in that the screw connection of the hinge

reinforcement plates (33, 34) cannot be actuated from the outer side of the leaf.
Frame according to claim 1, characterised in that one of the hinge
reinforcement plates (34) is provided with a single-piece bearing eye (34') for a

hinge pin (35).
Frame according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that two screw-in hinges
(25) are connected to a hinge reinforcement plate (34) and engage each end of a

hinge pin (35).
Frame according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, combined with a blind frame,
characterised in that a metal stiffening profile (14) is disposed on the end face

(12) of the blind frame spar (11) over the entire length of the spar and lies with
one edge (15) flush with the spar surface (16) adjacent to the frame cover (13)

and comprises all necessary fittings engagement recesses (17).
Frame according to claim 4, characterised in that the metal stiffening profile
(14) engages with a planar insert strip (18) into a slot (19) of the blind frame spar

(11) and is attached at this site.
Frame according to claim 5, characterised in that the insert strip (18) is 
disposed at an angle with respect to the stiffening profile (14) and engages on

the strip and/or closure side into the blind frame spar (11) of a window frame.
Frame according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in that a threaded hinge (24)
for a window is screwed into the insert strip (18) of the stiffening profile (14), or in

that a threaded hinge (25) for a door is screwed into the support strip (21) of the
stiffening profile (14).
Frame according to any one of the claims 5 to 7, characterised in that the
insert strip (18) together with a stiffening profile (14) formed as a planar strip

forms a single piece reinforcement strip and engages into a fill plate (20) of the
blind frame spar (11) on the strip and/or closure side.
Frame according to any one of the claims 4 to 8, characterised in that a
support strip (21) is attached to the stiffening profile (14) at an angle and is

connected on the strip and/or closure side to the rear side (22) of a lateral cover
strip (23) of the blind frame spar (11).
Frame according to any one of the claims 4 to 9, characterised in that a
threaded hinge (25) for a door is screwed into a securing bracket (26) of the

masonry (27) and/or into a reinforcement block (28) disposed between the said
masonry and the fill plate (20).
Frame according to any one of the claims 4 to 10, characterised in that the
fittings engagement recesses (17) for a lock bar (29), for a lock latch, for fittings

locking pins or for unhinging securing pins (30) are disposed out from the frame
cover (13) in front of the support strip (21) of the stiffening profile (14) and/or that

an unhinging securing pin (30) is attached to a circular strip sleeve (31) of the
window or door leaf or attached to a reinforcement strip (32), parallel with the

stiffening profile (14), of the end face (10') of the window or door leaf and / or that
the support strip (21) of the stiffening profile (14) is provided with undercut

recesses (36) for insert hooks (37) of lateral cover strips (23) or with press fit 
recesses (38) of attachment projections (39) of the lateral cover strips (23).
Frame according to any one of the claims 1 to 11, characterised in that a
spar (10, 11) of a wooden door or window leaf is provided outside and/or inside

in the closure region with a closure reinforcement plate (40) which irrespective of
the formation of the leaf closure device protrudes almost as far as the leaf end

face (10').
