<ABSTRACT>
The steam generator for an iron comprises a water tank (1) having in its upper part a steam-outlet port (2), intended to be connected to the iron, and a water-filling orifice (3). The generator comprises, upstream of the outlet port (2), a filter (4, 4a) intended for retaining the particles of scale which are formed during the heating of the water and which are capable of being carried along by the steam towards the steam-outlet port (2).

A steam generator for hand iron comprising a water tank (1), means to heat
the said water, whereas this tank (1) contains at its upper section a steam output

orifice (2) designed for connection to the hand iron, a water fill-up opening (3) and,
upstream of the output orifice (2), at least one filter (4, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d) designed for

retaining the scale particles formed during water heating and liable to be driven by
the steam towards the steam output orifice (2), whereas the steam generator is

characterised in that the filter (4, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d) is placed in the water fill-up opening
(3) under the plug (5) closing this opening.
A steam generator according to claim 1, characterised in that the filter (4,
4a, 4b, 4c, 4d) is arranged upstream of the solenoid valve (6) controlling the passage

of steam towards the hand iron.
A steam generator according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterised in that
the filter (4, 4a, 4d) is carried by the said plug (5).
A steam generator according to claim 3, characterised in that the plug (5)
comprises a coupling (7) screwed in the water fill-up opening (3) and comprises an

axial passage (8) communicating with the inside of the tank (1), whereas the lower
section of the coupling (7) comprises at least one filter (4, 4a, 4d) extending

perpendicular to the axis of passage (8) and the outer surface of the coupling (7)
comprises an annular groove (9) communicating with the passage (8) through one or

several openings (10) and with the steam output conduit (2).
A steam generator according to claim 4, characterised in that the said
passage (8) comprises two filters (4, 4a) arranged on top of one another.
A steam generator according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterised in
that the filter (4b, 4c) is spaced from the (5) and is fixed removable at the lower end

of the water fill-up opening (3).
A steam generator according to claim 6, characterised in that the filter (4b, 
4c) comprises a pick-up handle (11, 11a) protruding upwards into the fill-up opening

(3).
A steam generator according to claim 7, characterised in that the plug (5)
comprises a hollow coupling (7a) screwed into the said opening (3), whereas the

handle (11) of the filter (4b) protrudes into the hollow section (10a) of the coupling
(7).
A steam generator according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that
the filter (4, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d) is a grid or a drilled sheet, made of metal or of a plastic

material.
