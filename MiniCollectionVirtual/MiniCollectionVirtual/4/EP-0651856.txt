<ABSTRACT>
A valve-closed-orifice (VCO) spray tip (14) having an internal tip seat (18) and one or more fuel spray orifices (20). The thickness of the tip (14) in the wall portion defining the internal tip seat (18) and upstream entrance of each orifice is made less than that of previously known VCO tips. The length to diameter ratio of each orifice (20) is also relatively smaller than that of previously known VCO tips. Advantages of the thinner wall portion include improved fuel injection spray characteristics as well as reduced cost of forming orifices (20) through the tip (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
fuel injectors and, more particularly to spray tips
for injection nozzles.Closed type inwardly-opening fuel injection
nozzle assemblies typically include a hollow spray tip
or housing and a flow check positioned in the tip.
The tip has one or more fuel spray orifices and an
internal tip seat upon which the movable check
selectively seats.One category of such nozzle assemblies,
known as sac-type nozzle assemblies, generally
describes a tip configuration wherein the orifices are
located through a sac projecting from the apex of the
tip. Thus, in a sac-type tip, the orifices are
remotely spaced from the tip seat such that the check
does not cover, or even partially cover, the upstream
entrances of the orifices when the check is seated on
the tip seat. Examples of known sac-type nozzle
assemblies are shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,391,871
issued to Fleischer et al. on July 9, 1968 and
U.S. Patent No. 4,527,738 issued to Martin on July 9,
1985. Sac-type nozzle assemblies having a relatively
small sac volume are known as mini-sac nozzle
assemblies. An example of a mini-sac nozzle assembly
is shown in U.S. Patent No. 5,037,031 issued to
Campbell et al. on August 6, 1991. Typically, the sac of a sac-type tip has a
wall thickness in the range of about 0.60 to 0.80 mm
or millimeters (about 0.024 to 0.031 inches) in the
region where the orifices pass through. The ratio of
the axial length of an orifice to its cross-sectional
diameter helps determine its spray characteristics.
Generally, a relatively shorter length orifice
produces a bushier fuel spray having relatively lower
penetration capability through air in a combustion
chamber compared to a relatively longer length orifice
of the same cross-sectional area. Sac-type tips
generally produce well-atomized fuel sprays or plumes
which effectively disperse fuel over a wide region to
facilitate good mixing with air present in the engine
combustion chamber.However, sac-type tips are becoming
undesirable for currently-produced engines because
such tips help produce particulates that may prevent
the engines from meeting current and/or future
stringent emissions standards. The main culprit is
existence of the relatively large volume sac which
contains fuel after the check has seated on the tip
seat to end injection. Such fuel remaining in the
sac, after the check is seated, may continue flowing
at a reduced pressure towards the uncovered entrances
of each orifice due to fluid momentum and/or thermal
expansion caused by heat
