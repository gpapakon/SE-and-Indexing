<ABSTRACT>
An automatic machine for filling containers with loose 
products, in particular fruit and vegetable products, 

including: at least one product feeder (37) which is guided 
substantially horizontally; elements (30a, 31-34) for 

actuating the feeder with a reciprocating motion parallel 
to the product advancement direction; at least one 

supporting frame (11) for a container oscillatably 
articulated to the outlet of the feeder; and elements (48-52) 

for actuating the frame from a raised parking position, 
in which the container is inclined so that its mouth is 

directed towards the feeder at a preset maximum angle, to 
successive parking positions in which the container assumes 

progressively decreasing angles; in which the feeder, in 
the parking positions, performs an advancement stroke 

inside the container and a return stroke during which 
products are unloaded into the crate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic machine 
for filling containers, for example boxes or crates, with 
loose products, in particular with fruit and vegetable 
products. Various machines for loading loose products into 
crates currently exist. One of these machines includes a conveyor for the 
crates, which arrive at a duct for feeding the loose 
products which is substantially constituted by an undulated 
duct entering from above each crate, rotated about a 
vertical axis. The products leave the duct without 
suffering bruises since the duct is undulated, are arranged 
circumferentially about the outlet of the duct during the 
rotation of the crate. As the crate fills in layers, the feed duct rises 
until the crate is completely filled. This type of automatic machine has a rather low yield 
and furthermore has the drawback that the crates are not 
filled completely, especially at their corners. Another type of automatic machine includes a 
continuous conveyor for the crates, which in this case, 
too, are placed at a feed duct loading into the crate a row 
of loose products at a time along the entire length or 
width of the crate and then moving parallel to the 
deposited row, and so on until a first layer is formed on 
the bottom of the crate. Further rows of loose products are 
laid above the layer thus formed, so as to form a second 
layer superimposed on the preceding one, and so forth.  However, although this automatic machine has the 
advantage, with respect to the preceding one, of allowing 
higher operating speeds, it too has the drawback of 
defective crate filling: the sensors which determine a 
forward (or backward) movement of the feed duct "feel" the 
level of each deposited layer but cannot take into account 
possible empty spaces between the individual products along 
the same row; essentially, when the duct deposits a row of 
products, the row is likely to be discontinuous, with empty 
spaces located also and especially at the ends of the row; 
each layer deposited inside the crate thus has a non-uniform 
arrangement of products, and this ultimately leads 
to failure to completely fill each crate. There are other dry automatic machines which use 
methods entailing the use of a feed duct substantially 
similar to those described above, and there are also other 
wet systems which are in any case very expensive and 
currently virtually abandoned. A principal aim of the present invention is to provide 
an automatic machine for loading loose products into 
containers such as boxes

<CLAIMS>
Automatic machine for filling containers with loose 
products, in particular fruit and vegetable products, 

comprising: at least one product feeder (37) which is 
guided substantially horizontally; means (30a, 31-34) for 

actuating said feeder with a reciprocating motion parallel 
to the product advancement direction; at least one 

supporting frame (11) for a container (55) oscillatably 
articulated to the outlet of said feeder; and means (48-52) 

for actuating said frame (11) from a raised parking 
position, in which said container (55) is inclined so that 

its mouth is directed towards said feeder (37) at a preset 
maximum angle, to successive parking positions in which the 

container (55) assumes progressively decreasing angles; in 
which said feeder (37), in said parking positions, is able 

to perform an advancement stroke inside said container (55) 
and a return stroke during which products are unloaded into 

the crate. 
Filling machine according to claim 1, characterized 
in that it comprises a feeder (37) horizontally guided in a 

framework (1) and provided with longitudinal racks (33, 34) 
which are engaged by pinions (31, 32) actuated with 

reciprocating movement in order to impart said advancement 
and return strokes to said feeder (37). 
Filling machine according to claim 2, characterized 
in that said frame (11) comprises a platform (12-15) from 

which two uprights (16, 17) rise, the ends of said uprights 
being articulated in said framework (1) about an axis which 

is at right angles to the advancement direction of said 
 

feeder, said uprights (16, 17) being provided with wings 
(26, 27) suitable to allow the passage of the containers 

(55) on the platform (12-15) and provide a support for them 
during the filling process. 
Filling machine according to claim 3, characterized 
in that said platform comprises two strips (12, 13) along 

which two chains (23, 24) slide, said chains being closed 
in a loop around respective gears which are keyed on two 

shafts (21, 22) supported at the opposite ends of said 
strips, one of said shafts being actuated by a gearmotor 

(25) which is mounted on said platform. 
Filling machine according to claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that said means for the actuation of the 

frame (11) comprise a lifting device which is composed of a 
shaft (47) supported on said framework (1) and actuated by 

a gearmotor (48), two pulleys (49, 50) being keyed on said 
shaft to wind two cables (51, 52) the ends of which are 

connected to said platform (12, 15). 
Filling machine according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said framework (1) comprises 

a base (2-5) from which two posts (6, 7) rise, said posts 
supporting said lifting device (47-50) at their top ends 

and being provided with rollers (41) protruding in a 
cantilever manner for the sliding support of said feeder 

(37). 
Filling machine according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said feeder (37) comprises 

two parallel lateral panels (35, 36) in which two rollers 
are supported for the winding of a product conveyor belt 

(38) having a chute (40) at its outlet.
