<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of microstructures on a substrate by forming a resist film on the substrate and exposing the resist film through a mask, characterised in that the resist film contains an etch barrier-forming substance which, on exposure, results in the production of a metal gradient in the exposed zones of the resist film, and in that the exposed resist film is subsequently developed using an oxygen plasma, where the unexposed areas of the resist film are etched out, and a resist solution containing   a) a matrix polymer containing at least one aromatic structural unit,   b) a compound which liberates acid or free radicals under actinic radiation,   c) a retardable etch barrier-forming substance,   d) a solvent, and   e) optionally further additives, and the use of the resist solution for the production of semiconductor components in microelectronics. The process enables the etch barrier-forming substance to be introduced with the resist solution and gives an accurate reproduction of the mask on the substrate.
