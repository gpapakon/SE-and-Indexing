<ABSTRACT>
A tyre former for use in a tyre building apparatus, 
the tyre former includes a centre ring (54) provided 

coaxially around a drum shaft (52) and a pair of 
side rings (56a, 56b) provided coaxially around the 

drum shaft and on opposite sides of the centre ring. 
The centre ring (54) consists of a plurality of 

circumferentially separatable ring segments (55). 
The side rings (56a, 56b) are movable closer to and 

away from each other along the shaft to selectively 
provide an axially expanded state where the side 

rings are positioned on opposite sides of the centre 
ring and an outer circumferential surface of the 

side rings is flush with an outer circumferential of 
the centre ring; and an axially contracted state 

where the side rings are positioned radially inside 
of the centre ring.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tyre former for use in a
tyre building apparatus.There has been known a tyre building apparatus as
shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4, a tyre building
apparatus 10 is provided with a tyre former 12, a
tread ring forming drum 14, and a transfer device
16 for transferring a tread ring to the tyre former
12 from the tread ring forming drum 14.
Specifically, cylindrical carcass plies are
assembled onto the tyre former 12 and bead cores of
wire are put on each side of the carcass plies on
the tyre former 12. On the other hand, a tread ring
is formed on the drum 14, and then transferred to
the tyre former 12 by the transfer device 16. When
the tread ring is positioned around the carcass
plies on the tyre former 12, the tyre former 12 is
axially expanded to deform the carcass plies into a
toroidal shape. The outer surface of the toroidal
carcass plies adheres to the inner surface of the
tread ring. In this way, a green tyre is formed. As shown in Fig. 5, the tyre former 12
conventionally comprises a centre ring 20 and a pair
of side rings 22 which are provided at opposite
sides of the centre ring 20. The side rings 22 are
mounted on a drum shaft 18 and movable closer to and
away from each other in the axial direction of the
drum shaft 18.The outer diameter of each side ring 22 is set such
that the outer circumferential surface of the side
ring 22 comes slidably in contact with the inner
circumferential surface of the centre ring 20. When
the side rings 22 move closer to each other from the
positions shown in Fig. 5, i.e., in directions of
the arrow in Fig. 5, they are consequently located
inside the centre ring 20. In this way, the tyre
former 12 may change from the wide drum stage shown
in Fig. 5 to a narrow drum stage in which the side
rings 22 are located inside the centre ring 20.More specifically, a green tyre is built with the
above tyre building apparatus as follows. First,
after the carcass plies 26 are wrapped around the
outer circumferential surface of the tyre former 12
set in its wide drum stage. Bead cores 30 including
a bead apex 28 are placed at opposite outer ends of 
the carcass plies 26. Subsequently, an
unillustrated bladder of a bead locking device 24
provided at the outer end of each side ring 22 is
inflated, and opposite ends 32 of the carcass plies
26 are, as shown in Fig. 5, turned up to cover the
bead wires 30. Thereafter, the side rings 22 are
moved closer to each other to change the tyre former
12 into the narrow drum stage, and air is supplied
between the centre

A tyre former for use in a tyre building
apparatus, the tyre former comprising a shaft (52),

a radially expandable centre ring (54) provided
coaxially around the shaft, including a plurality of

centre plates (55) separable from one another in the
circumferential direction of the centre ring (54)

and movable in the radial direction and biasing
means for biasing the plurality of centre plates

(55) inwardly of the centre ring (54), a pair of
side rings (56a,56b) mounted coaxially on the shaft

(52), the side rings (56a,56b) being movable closer
to and away from each other along the shaft to

selectively provide an axially expanded state where
the side rings (56a,56b) are positioned on opposite

sides of the centre ring (54) and an outer
circumferential surface of the side rings is flush

with an outer circumferential surface of the centre
ring and an axially contracted state where the side

rings are positioned radially inside the centre
ring, a pair of sliders slidably mounted on the

shaft for supporting the pair of side rings
respectively, characterised in that guide means is

provided for each centre plate (55) between the pair
of sliders for guiding the axial movement of the

pair of slide rings (56a,56b), the guide means 
includes a stationary rod (86) extending in parallel

with the shaft (52) and having a first block (84)
