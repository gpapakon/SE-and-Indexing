<ABSTRACT>
There is a fire wall in the case of which upright profiles 1 consisting of sheet metal are provided on at least one side with a wall shell 3 which exhibits an inner gypsum board 5, resting against the upright profiles, and an outer gypsum board 4, of which the inner side bears against an intermediate steel plate 6, and in the case of which the inner gypsum board 5 is screwed onto the upright profiles 1 by means of inner screws 12 and the outer gypsum board 4 is retained by outer bolt means 11 which project through the outer gypsum board and the steel plate into the inner gypsum board 5. In this arrangement, it is desired for the fire wall to comprise gypsum boards of lower relative density, as fibrous gypsum boards, and nevertheless to have the impact strength in the event of a fire which is required of a fire wall and to possess stable fastening for the outer gypsum boards and the steel plate. This is achieved in that the gypsum boards are of the type of gypsum boards 4, 5 provided on both sides with cover layers 8, and the outer bolt means are screws 11 which are screwed through the inner gypsum board 5 and onto the upright profiles 1. In order to fasten the outer gypsum board, provided with cover layers, and the steel plate on the upright profiles in a sufficiently secure manner, use is made of screws, and said screws are also screwed into the upright profiles.

A fire wall with gypsum wallboards, wherein support sections 
(1) of sheet metal are provided with a wall shell (3) at at 

least one side, this wall shell (3) having an inner gypsum 
wallboard (5) which is in contact with the support sections 

and an outer gypsum wallboard (4) whose inner side is in 
contact with an intercalated steel plate (6), and wherein the 

inner gypsum wallboard (5) is screwed to the support sections 
(1) by means of inner screws (12) and the outer gypsum 

wallboard (4) is secured by outer bolts (11) which project into 
the inner gypsum wallboard through the outer gypsum wallboard 

and the steel plate, characterised in that the gypsum 
wallboards are the type of gypsum wallboards (4, 5, 9) provided 

with covering layers (8) at either side and the outer bolts are 
dry wall screws (11) which are screwed to the support sections 

(1) through the outer gypsum wallboard (4), the steel plate (6) 
and the inner gypsum wallboard (5). 
A fire wall in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that 
the intercalated steel plate (6) contacts with the inner 

gypsum wallboard (5) to the interior and the covering layers 
(8) of the gypsum wallboards (5, 6) are in each case formed from 

glass fibre non-woven material or from a layer of glass fibre 
non-woven material. 
A fire wall in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that at least two adjacent strips of steel plate (6) are 

provided over the length of each support section (1) and these 
two steel-plate strips overlap one another (10) when viewed in 

the longitudinal direction. 
A fire wall in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the distance between two adjacent outer 

screws (11) is considerably less than the distance between two  
 

adjacent inner screws (12). 
A fire wall in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the space between two adjacent support 

sections (1) is provided with an incombustible or flame-resistant 
filler mat (2).
