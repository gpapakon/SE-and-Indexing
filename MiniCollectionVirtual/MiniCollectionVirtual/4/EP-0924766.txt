The memory cell device has a semiconductor substrate incorporating a memory cell matrix, each memory cell having at least one selection transistor coupled to a memory element and controlled via a pair of intersecting word lines (214,218). Each group of memory cells may be arranged in a cell block associated with a common bit line (22). The word lines may be coupled to the gate electrodes of respective vertical selection transistors.
