<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrophotographic toner having a
deformed spherical shape of substantially a same
particle size, an easy method for obtaining same, and the use
of the resulting toner particles in an electrophotographic developing apparatus. The term "deformed" here
means "processed for having a shape of other than a
substantially exact sphere", and the same hereinafter.Solid ink called toner is widely used in image
forming methods such as electronic photograph, and
electrostatic recording method etc. As for a general
method for manufacturing the toner, a method has been
used in which resin and additives such as coloring
agents are mixed together, the mixture is pulverized
into particles having small diameters, and subsequently 
the particles are classified in order to obtain
particles having adequate diameters.Currently, so-called polymerized toner capable of
being manufactured without the pulverization and the
classification has widely been studied (JP-A-57-154253
(1982)). The polymerized toner is manufactured without
the pulverizing operation after polymerization of the
resin by controlling a particle size distribution to an
adequate one for toner particles when the resin is
produced by a suspension polymerization method or an
emulsion polymerization method.
The toner particles obtained by the above methods have a
narrower particle size distribution than that of the
particles obtained by the pulverization method, and
accordingly, the classification of the particles is not
necessary.Further, the toner particle obtained by the above
method has a smaller surface area than that of the toner
particle obtained by the prior art, and accordingly, the
toner particle has an advantage of being small
hygroscopic.When the toner is manufactured by a polymerization
method, the process has the steps of polymerizing the
resin, settling the particles by centrifuging, removing
dispersing agents by repeating the settling and
decanting after adding water to the particles, and
drying the particles. The above described process is
complex in its operation, and is more disadvantageous in 
necessary time and cost than the conventional
pulverization method.Further, the particles obtained by the
polymerization method have a problem that the particle
is substantially an exact spherical shape, although the
particles have a relatively same diameter. When the
particle is an exact sphere, the particle has a small
surface area, and has had a problem for being used as a
toner such as a poor charging property
