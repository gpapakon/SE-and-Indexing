<ABSTRACT>
A bi-metal gauge includes a bi-metal element 
(112) deflectable on application of heat thereto, a 

base plate (116) supporting the bi-metal element 
(112), a pointer carrier (150) rotatable on deflection 

of the bi-metal element (112), a pointer (160) 
connected to and rotatable with the pointer carrier 

(150), and a gauge case including guide means 
(118,120;126,127) for guiding the base plate (116) 

substantially in a single direction relative to the 
pointer carrier (150). The pointer (160) includes a 

shaft (156) having a bore therein of substantially 
circular axial cross-section and the pointer carrier 

comprises a link pin of substantially circular axial 
cross-section receivable in the bore of the pointer 

shaft (156) such that the pointer (160) can be fitted 
to the pointer carrier (150) in any orientation. 

Calibration includes a first step in which the support 
member is moved until a link pin (154) of the bi-metal 

element (112) is a predetermined distance of the axis 
of rotation of the pointer (160) and a second step in 

which the pointer (160) is placed in the correct 
orientation on the pointer carrier (150).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bi-metal 
gauge and to a method of calibrating a bi-metal gauge. A known bi-metal gauge includes a bi-metal 
element fixed to a support member and having a 
cantilevered portion over which an electrical coil is 
wound. When current is passed through the coil, the 
cantilevered portion is heated and deflects from its 
rest position due to the imbalance in the composition 
thereof. The free end of the cantilevered portion cooperates 
with a pointer carrier such that deflection 
of the cantilevered portion causes rotation of a 
pointer carried by the pointer carrier. On assembly of the gauge, the position of 
the bi-metal element must be adjusted relative to the 
pointer carrier to ensure (a) that deflection of the 
bi-metal element will cause rotation of the pointer 
through the whole of its intended range and (b) that 
deflection of the bi-metal element causes the correct 
amount of rotation of the pointer. In a known bi-metal gauge, this calibration 
is carried out in two steps, the first of which 
involves rotating the bi-metal element relative to the 
pointer carrier so as to adjust rest position of the 
pointer and thereby the amount of rotation of the 
pointer for any predetermined gauge reading. The 
second stage involves moving the support member in a 
direction towards or away from the pointer carrier so 
as to adjust the range of rotation of the pointer. The first stage of this calibration is 
achieved by mounting the pointer carrier and an end of 
the support member adjacent the pointer carrier to a 
cam in such a manner that rotation of the cam rotates 
the bi-metal element relative to the pointer carrier. 
The pointer carrier is provided with a pointer pin 
which is D-shaped in axial cross-section and fits into  
 
a bore of the pointer shaft, which is also D-shaped in 
axial cross-section, such that rotation of the pointer 
carrier results in adjustment of the rest position of 
the pointer. A problem with this type of gauge is that 
the calibration stage is time consuming and expensive. The present invention seeks to provide an 
improved bi-metal gauge and method of calibrating a 
bi-metal gauge. According to an aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a bi-metal gauge as 
specified in claim 1. Giving a support member of the gauge a 
single direction of movement means that only one 
calibration step must be carried out on the support 
member, namely the step of adjusting the range of 
movement of the gauge pointer caused by deflection of 
the
