<ABSTRACT>
Devices built to design rules ≦0.25µm are pattern delineated by use of 
synchrotron-emitted x-ray radiation using a condenser which collects over a 

collection arc of at least 100 mrad. Condenser designs provide for processing of 
collected radiation to tailor characteristics such as direction and divergence. Pattern 

delineation by proximity printing as well as by projection printing is described. 
Forms of projection printing include reduction ringfield projection as by 5:1 

mask:image reduction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to fabrication of devices built to submicron design 
rules. Synchrotron-derived x-ray radiation serves for pattern delineation for small 
features considered unattainable by use of longer wavelength electromagnetic 
radiation. Pattern delineation may be 1:1 as in proximity patterning, or may be 
reduction as in favored forms of projection patterning. Very Large Scale Integration 
("VLSI") is a prime device objective. State-of-the-art VLSI is a 16 megabit chip with circuitry built to design 
rules of 0.5µm. Effort directed to further miniaturization takes the initial form of 
more fully utilizing resolution capability of presently-used ultraviolet ("UV") 
delineating radiation. "Deep" UV (λ = 0.3 µm -0.1 µm), with techniques such as 
phase masking, off-axis illumination, and step-and-repeat may permit design rules 
(minimum feature or space dimension) of 0. 25µm or slightly smaller. At still smaller design rules, a different form of delineating radiation is 
required to avoid wavelength-related resolution limits. An extensive effort depends 
on electron or other charged-particle radiation. Use of electromagnetic radiation for 
this purpose will require x-ray wavelengths. One approach to x-ray delineation is proximity printing. In this 
approach, which resembles photographic contact printing, the x-ray mask is placed 
on top of the wafer. (To protect the fragile, costly, fine-featured mask, it is placed 
close to but out of contact with the wafer - thus the term "proximity"). The 
arrangement certainly avoids complex (reflecting) optics required for projection 
imaging, but is restricted to 1:1, object:image size. Projection imaging reduces likelihood of mask damage. Reduction 
capability reduces cost of the now larger-feature mask. A promising version is 
ringfield projection with object-to-image reduction of perhaps 5:1. Ringfield makes 
use of an arcuate slit of high aspect ratio with all portions of the slit at constant 
distance from the optical axis of the lens system to avoid radially-dependent 
aberrations. See, co-pending U.S. application SN 07/732,559, filed July 19, 1991.  Advancement in both proximity and projection x-ray lithography have 
been impressive. A variety of design parameters have been optimized. In proximity 
printing, techniques have been developed for avoiding mask damage while providing 
for needed close mask-to-wafer spacing. Step-and-scan is expected to yield 
acceptable patterns in ringfield projection. Both are believed capable of 0.1 µm 
resolution in
