<ABSTRACT>
This invention is directed to a panel-fixed connector 
which can be readily secured to a panel P and can maintain a 

stable attached position on the panel P. In the connector, 
when a lock member 5 is inserted into a clearance 16, a base 

plate 21 and an attaching piece 22 are inserted into the 
clearance 16 and an engaging protrusion 19 is engaged with 

an engaging aperture 30. When the connector is pushed into 
an attaching hole W in the panel P, a pawl 32 on a locking 

arm 25 is engaged with the hole W. Then, a slant face 33 of 
the pawl 32 is not injured by an edge E. Even if the 

locking arm 25 is deflected, a contacting piece 26 abuts on 
the base plate 21 thereby restraining a deflection of the 

arm 25 and preventing the lock member 5 from loosening in 
the clearance 16.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a panel-fixed type
connector which is secured to an attaching hole formed in a
panel.For convenience of explanation, a conventional panel-fixed
type connector will be explained below by referring to
FIGURES 9 and 10. FIGURE 9 is a longitudinal sectional view
of a part of the prior panel-fixed type connector and FIGURE
10 is an explanatory view illustrating a problem in the
prior connector. As shown in FIGURE 9, some of the prior
panel-fixed type connectors are made of a plastic material.A connector 50 shown in the drawings is a male
connector or a so-called door-waiting connector which is
secured to a panel P on a car body side or a door side in an
automobile. The connector 50 is provided with a hood 51
which receives a female connector 60. The hood 51 is
provided around a mouth edge with a flange 52. When an end
of the hood 51 is inserted into an attaching hole W in the
panel P, the flange 52 contacts with a peripheral edge of
the hole W.Also, the hood 51 is provided on an upper portion and
a lower portion with a resilient locking arm 53 which has a
pawl 54 at its distal end. When the end of the hood 51 is
inserted into the attaching hole W, the locking arm 53 is
inserted into the hole W while being deflected and the pawl
54 engages with the peripheral edge of the hole W. Thus,
the connector 50 is secured to the panel P by a clamping
action of the pawl 54 and flange 52. The pawl 54 has a
slant face 55 which raises outwardly and rearwardly and a
vertical face 56 which extends in parallel with the flange
52.However, since the attaching hole W in the panel P is
formed by a punching work, the mouth edge will become sharp
and be provided with a burr. Consequently, upon attaching
the connector to the panel, as shown in FIGURE 10, the slant 
face 55 on the pawl 54 is damaged by the sharp edge E and the pawl 54
cannot be readily engaged with the hole W.Although the attaching hole W may be smoothly worked in order to
overcome the problem, a working cost will be high. Further, in the case
of forming the slant face 55 of the connector from a hard material such as
a metal, the connector will become complicated in construction, large in
size, and high in cost.We are aware of US Patent No. US-A-4 609 119 which discloses a
connector which has been used to form the pre-characterising portion of
the independent claim.An object of the present invention is to provide a panel-fixed type
connector which can overcome various problems caused by a slant face
thereof made of a hard material.In order
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A panel-fixed type connector which mounts a hood (2) of a
connector body (1) on an attaching hole W in a panel, in which


said hood (2) is provided around a mouth edge thereof with an
attaching portion (13) for supporting a lock member (5) made of a hard

material; and
said lock member (5) includes a base plate (21), an attaching
piece (22) provided on an end of said base plate (21) and adapted to be

secured to said attaching portion (13), and a resilient locking arm (25)
having a pawl to be engaged with said attaching hole W, characterised in

that
said attaching portion (13) on said hood (2) is formed by a
clearance (16) for receiving said base plate (21) of said lock member (5)

and a lock protrusion in said clearance, wherein said attaching piece (22)
of said lock member (5) is folded on said base plate so as to be inserted

into said clearance (16), and wherein an engaging aperture (30) is formed
in said attaching piece (22) to receive said lock protrusion, and the

lock member (5) is secured to the attaching portion (13) in the hood (2)
so that the locking arm can be elastically deflected.
A panel-fixed type connector according to Claim 1, wherein said
attaching piece (22) is provided with a contacting end (26) which is

directed to said base plate (21) so that said end contacts with said plate.
A panel-fixed type connector according to Claim 1, wherein a first
bend portion (23) which is folded inwardly at an obtuse angle and a

second bend portion (24) which is folded outwardly at an obtuse angle are
formed between said base plate (21) of said lock member (5) and said 

locking arm (25), and wherein said locking arm (25) is arranged in
parallel with said base plate (21).
A panel-fixed type connector according to Claim 1, wherein said
locking arm (25) of said lock member (5) is provided with an outer limit

piece (35) which contacts with said attaching portion (13) so that said
outer limit piece (35) restrains said arm from inclining outwardly, and

said outer limit piece (35) contacts an outer wall (15) of the attaching
portion (13).
