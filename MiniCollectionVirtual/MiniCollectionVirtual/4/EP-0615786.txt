<ABSTRACT>
A separator for separating two or 
more materials of which one or more 

consist(s) of a particulate, 
fluidisable material such as 

aluminium oxide, from a material 
which cannot be fluidised such as 

nails, tools, coke, pieces of wood, 
lumps of oxide. The separator 

comprises a chamber (1
) in which 
are located one or more screens (7, 

9) and one or more fluidising/transport 
channels (8, 10) underneath, 

at angles established in 
advance.

 
The separator has no movable parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a separator for separating two or
more materials, of which one consists of a particulate,
fluidisable powder material, such as aluminium oxide, Al2O3
(hereinafter called oxide), from a material which cannot be
fluidised, such as, for example, nails, tools, coke, pieces of
wood, lumps of oxide.Oxide is used as the main component when producing aluminium in
a Hall-Heroult electrolysis process and is forwarded by bulk
carrier ship from the supplier to the aluminium works. At works
which produce anodes and/or cathodes, the oxide is unloaded in
most cases using the same equipment as is used for unloading
coke/anthracite. Undesired material components in the oxide can
be transported and added during the various transport phases from
an oxide works to the electrolysis cells. Furthermore, the oxide
may become lumpy, which is not desirable from an operational
point of view.If undesired, non-fluidisable materials are introduced into the
electrolysis cells' bath, this may cause operating problems in
the electrolysis cells and a significant reduction in quality of
the aluminium product.In order to avoid the above-mentioned problems, a separator is
usually inserted ahead of the electrolysis cells so that only
fluidisable, i.e. purified, oxide is fed into the cells.A number of procedures are known for separating oxide. Most of
them have too little capacity on the one hand and the separating 
effect is too low on the other. Norwegian patent no. 167263
describes a device for separating fluidisable material from non-fluidisable
material. An eddy layer apparatus and screens are
used in a chamber which is placed on spiral springs. Furthermore,
the chamber is vibrated mechanically and periodically to avoid
the chamber becoming overfilled, as well as to increase the
capacity. A disadvantage of this procedure is the wear caused to
the chamber, the sleeves and the screens during vibration and
eddies; in the long term this can be expensive on account of
maintenance, repairs and production disturbances. Moreover, it is
generally known that productivity is low with mechanical
vibration screening. GB-A-2 116 064 relates to a fluidised bed system in a combustor where particulate material
periodically is removed from the fluidised bed in order to effect size regradings. The fine
particles are recycled to the bed, whereas the larger, oversized particles are removed from
the system by a separator. The separator comprises an inclined screen for separating
particles into fine and coarse fractions, where

<CLAIMS>
A separator for separating two or more materials of which one consists of a particulate,
fluidisable powder material, such as, for example, aluminium oxide, Al2O3 into

components with different particle size and/or separating such materials, from an
undesired material which cannot be fluidised such as nails, tools, coke, pieces of wood,

lumps of oxide, gloves etc., comprising a chamber with a separating device that
comprises one or more screens (7,9) through which the fluidisable particle fractions are

designed to fall down into a ducting device for the transport to a lower outlet (12), and
where the non-fluidisable material is designed to be fed down the screens (7,9) to an

upper outlet (13),
characterised in that

the raw material is fed into the separator by means of fluidising/transport channel (1)
and that the ducting device comprises one or more fluidising/transport channels (8, 10)

arranged underneath the screen and provided with supply devices for a fluidising fluid,
for ex. air.
A separator in accordance with claim 1,
characterised in that

the screens (7, 9) consist of a number of longitudinal sections (22) with intermediate slit
openings (25), which sections are made of a durable material, for example steel.
A separator in accordance with claim 2,
characterised in that

the sections (22) have tapering cross-sections so that the width of the slit openings (25)
increases downwards.
A separator in accordance with claims 1-3,
characterised in that

separation takes place in two phases with two fluidising/transport channels (8, 1 0) and
two screens (7,9) and in that the angles of inclination of the fluidising/transport channel

and the screen in the first separation phase are preferably α
1
=8° and α
2
=4° and in the
second separation phase preferably α
4
=36° and α
3
=30°. 
A separator in accordance with claims 1-4,
characterised in that

variations in the supply of raw materials can be eliminated in two stages by inserting an
angle-shaped vertical transport channel (1'') into the raw material inlet (1) and inserting a

steel plate (4) with a mounted distribution plate (5) downstream above the screen (9).
A separator in accordance with claims 1-5,
characterised in that

the screens and the fluidising/transport channels are integrated in one chamber (1').
A separator in accordance with claim 6,
characterised in that

one or more transparent, removable hatches (3) are placed on the upper side of the
chamber.
A separator in accordance with claims 1-7,
characterised in that

the chamber (1') is provided with a extraction device (6) for dust particles.
A separator in accordance with claim 1-8,
characterised in that

the screens (7, 9) have different openings to separate the fluidisable materials into
components with different particle sizes.
