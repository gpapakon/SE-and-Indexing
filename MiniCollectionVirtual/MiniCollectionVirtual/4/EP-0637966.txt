<ABSTRACT>
A method for treating a tumor involves the initial identification of the tumor as one displaying a "bystander effect", whereby in vivo transfer of a gene conferring sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agent affects both transformed and non-transformed tumor cells. Into a tumor thus characterized is introduced in situ a retroviral vector containing the sensitizing gene. The retroviral vector, which may be a replication-defective or a replication-competent, can be introduced directly (if it is replication-competent) or can be provided by means of a packaging cell line. Treatment of the patient with the chemotherapeutic agent thereafter effects tumor regression when as few as 10 % of tumor cells are transformed, while normal tissue is not damaged. The anti-tumor impact of the treatment can be increased when the transducing vector also encodes an immune response-enhance substance such as IL-2 or another cytokine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an approach to 
cancer therapy which entails gene transfer in vivo. Gene transfer has been recognized for some time as 
a promising avenue to therapies for cancers, among other 
diseases. The earliest applications of gene transfer for 
cancer treatment have been indirect approaches focusing 
on enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. Thus, for 
instance, attempts have been made to increase the 
cytotoxicity of immune cells, or to enhance their 
proliferation. In one such approach, the gene for tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF) was inserted into tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TIL) in an attempt to use the homing 
properties of TIL to deliver the toxic gene product 
preferentially to the tumor in situ. Initiation of this 
protocol has been difficult, however, because transduced 
T-cells shut down vector cytokine expression. Rosenberg 
et al., Human Gene Therapy1: 443 (1990). By another approach, tumor cells have been modified 
in vitro with cytokine genes and reintroduced into 
patients in an attempt to immunize the patient to their 
own cancer. In animal studies, the IL-4 gene was 
introduced to tumors by Tepper et al., Cell57: 503 
(1989); the IL-2 gene by Fearon et al., Cell60: 397 
(1990), and by Gansbacher et al., J. Exp. Med. 172: 1217 
(1990); the interferon-gamma gene by Gansbacher et al., 
Cancer Res. 50: 7820 (1990); and TNF gene by Asher et 
al., J. Immunol. 146: 3227 (1991). Each of the animal 
studies demonstrated rejection of genetically altered 
tumors upon reimplantation, and the mice in these studies 
were immune to subsequent rechallenge with the same 
tumor. Rosenberg and co-workers have carried out similar 
experiments in humans using the TNF gene and the IL-2  
 
gene, respectively, with encouraging results. See 
Rosenberg et al., Human Gene Therapy3: 57, 75 (1992). These early investigations of the clinical use of 
gene transfer required that the tumor be excised and TIL 
or tumor cell lines established in culture which then 
could be gene-transduced in vitro and subsequently 
reimplanted into the patient. This approach is 
complicated, expensive, and limited by the fact that TIL 
and tumor lines cannot be regrown in vitro from the 
tumors of all patients and by the necessity to perform ex 
vivo transduction. Retroviral vectors currently provide the most 
efficient means for ex vivo gene transfer in the clinical 
setting, but their usefulness has been seen as limited 
because retroviruses stably integrate only in target 
cells that are actively

Use of: 

a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence which, 
when expressed in cells of a tumor that exhibits a 

bystander effect, confers sensitivity to a 
chemotherapeutic agent,
 
in the preparation of a medicament for 
in situ
 treatment 
of a tumor that exhibits a bystander effect, by the 

delivery of said polynucleotide to a tumor 
in situ
 to 
express said polynucleotide in cells of said tumor 
in 
situ
, whereby said polynucleotide renders said cells 
sensitive to the toxic effects of said chemotherapeutic 

agent and, in the presence of said chemotherapeutic 
agent, engenders a bystander effect that also is toxic 

to cells of said tumor that do not express said 
polynucleotide. 
A use according to claim 1, wherein said 
polynucleotide is in the form of a retroviral vector in 

a retroviral producer cell line. 
A use according to claim 2, wherein said cell line 
is injected into said tumor.

said polynucleotide is in the form of a replication-competent 

retroviral vector.

chemotherapeutic agent is activated by said thymidine 

kinase. 
A use according to any one of claims 1-6, wherein
