<ABSTRACT>
A device for preparing a medicinal solution from two components of which one is powdered, freeze-dried or liquid while the other is a diluent or liquid solvent. The components are held in a sealed distal container (11) and a proximal container (13) respectively, and each container has an opening sealed by an axially slidable valve plug. The slidable valve plugs (19, 24) are interconnected by a transfer rod (15) providing a rigid, sealed and sterile coupling therebetween when the device (10) is in a storage position, and defining a sealed and sterile communicating channel between the two containers (11, 13) when the device is in an operative position. Said valve plugs (19, 24) have a central region provided with a slot (31, 33) which is tightly closed and sealed when the device is in the storage position, and open when one end of the transfer rod (15) is inserted therein with the device in the operative position.

Device for the preparation of a solution, suspension or emulsion from
an active medicinal substance by using two components, one of which is in

powder form, a lyophilisate, a liquid or a paste, and the second is a dilutant or
a liquid solvent, and which respectively are stored in two elongated

containers, the one container being a rear container (11), closed at the
bottom (17), and the other container a front container (13), each of which has

at one of its ends an opening closed by a stopper-piston-valve, axially
movable in the corresponding container, these two stopper-piston-valves (19,

24) being connected together by a transfer shaft (15), this transfer shaft being
arranged to ensure a rigid, tight and sterile coupling between the two stopper-piston-valves

(19, 24) when the device (10) is in a first position, namely a
storage position, and to define a channel (16) of tight and sterile

communication between the two containers (11, 13) when the device is in a
second position, namely the use position, the two stopper-piston-valves (19,

24) being respectively provided with a central groove (25, 26) in which a
ferrule (27, 28) integral with the transfer shaft (15) is fitted, this transfer shaft

being equipped with a first stop (34) and a second stop (35) which, except for
storage, are respectively in support of the surfaces in regard to stopper-piston-valves

(24) and (19), and in which the rear container (11) contains said
component in powder form, as a lyophilisate, as a liquid or a paste, and the

front container (13) contains said dilutant or liquid solvent (14), in which the
rear container has a transverse section which is greater than that of the front

container, the stopper-piston-valve (19) of the rear container (11) having a
transverse section which is greater than that of the stopper-piston-valve (24)

of the front container (13), in which the ends of the transfer shaft (15) are
shaped according to a plane substantially perpendicular to its longitudinal

axis, and in which these stopper-piston-valves have a central zone provided
with a slit (31, 33), which is strongly compressed and closed tightly when the

device is in a storage position, and which is open when one end of the
transfer shaft (15) is introduced into it when the device is in said second

position.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that it comprises a
sleeve (60) in which is located the front container (13) and at least partially 

the rear container (11).
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the sleeve (60) is
linked to a cup (70) and to a mechanism (71) for the application of multiple

dosages.
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that said sleeve (60) is
made integrally to the front container (13).
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that said sleeve (60) is
provided with a ferrule (54) consisting of an ophthalmic drops applicator or a

nasal vaporizer, integrated in the front container (13).
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that said sleeve includes
a first tubular element (40) and a second tubular element (42) to be fitted into

one another, the first tubular element containing said front container (13) and
said second element containing said rear container (11).
Device according to claim 6, characterized in that said first tubular
element has catches (43) and in that said second tubular element has at least

two tongue-shaped strips (44) arranged to co-operate with said catches.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said stopper-piston-valves
(19, 24) are adapted to ensure a tight and sterile closure of the

corresponding containers (11, 13), by supporting the inner sides of these
containers, in such a way that these containers may be stored and handled

independently.
