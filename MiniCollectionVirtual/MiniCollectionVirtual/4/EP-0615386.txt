<ABSTRACT>
A video signal compressor includes apparatus (11-17) 
for generating motion vectors for respective blocks of video data. 

Ones of the motion vectors (other than those which provide (18) 
direction to co-located blocks in other frames) are determined to 

be candidates to conversion to vectors which do provide direction 
to co-located blocks. However, conversion is precluded (100,102) 

if the vector is determined to be correlated with one of the 
neighboring motion vectors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to motion compensated
compression apparatus for processing video data on a block by
block basis and more particularly for processing motion vectors
associated with respective blocks.Current trends in video signal recording and
transmission are leaning toward the use of digital compression
techniques. Toward this end the International Organisation for
Standardisation has been developing a series of compression
signal protocols designated MPEG1, MPEG2, etc. These protocols
require that the video signal be compressed according to motion
compensated prediction techniques in which the video signal is
divided into matrices or blocks of contiguous pixels and thereafter
the signal is processed on a block basis.In typical motion compensated predictive compression
successive images are predicted from prior compressed images.
The current image is subtracted, on a pixel by pixel basis, from its
associated predicted image, and the differences or residues are
encoded for storage or transmission. In generating the predicted
images, blocks of the current image are compared with like sized
blocks of the predicted image until the closest block match is
found. A set of motion vectors is generated which indicate the
block of the predicted image which most nearly matches the real
image. The differences between the two blocks and the motion
vectors form, in major part, the compressed information. The
residues may however undergo transform processing and variable
length and statistical encoding. For detailed information on
motion compensated predictive compression see Peter A. Ruetz
et.al. "A High-Performance Full-Motion Video Compression Set", or
Hiroshi Fujiwara, et.al "An All-ASIC Implementation of a Low Bit-Rate
Video Codec" and Chaur-Heh Hsieh, et.al. "VLSI Architecture
for Block-Matching Motion Estimation Algorithm" all of which are
to be found in IEEE TRANS. ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO
TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 2, No. 2, JUNE 1992. 
In certain systems such as the MPEG 1 system, a decision is made
whether to code a set of motion vectors or not. This is called a
MC/no-MC decision.The purpose of the MC/no-MC decision is to determine
for each block of compressed data whether to select the motion
vector(s) resulting from the motion estimation search (MC), or to
select (0,0) motion vectors (no-MC) instead. The MC/no-MC
decision is applied to each block of the Picture. If the particular
system performs both forward and backward prediction as in the
MPEG systems a MC/no-MC decision is made independently
