<CLAIMS>
A roller device for a second rail part (12) adjustable relative to a first rail part (10) and
supportable on a roller element (14), said second rail part resting in a non-contacting

and in a contacting position on a sole-plate (18) such as a slide chair and preferably
being at a distance from said sole-plate between these positions,
wherein

the roller element (14) is supported on at least two spring elements (77, 76) that are
mechanically connected to one another such that in the non-contacting and contacting

positions of the second rail part (12) only one of the spring elements (74) acts with a
tension spring function and in the intermediate position only the other spring element

(76) acts with a compression spring function.
A roller device for a second rail part (114) adjustable relative to a first rail part (108)
and supportable on a roller element (107, 109, 111, 113), said second rail part resting

at least in the contacting first position on a sole-plate such as a slide chair and being at
a distance from said sole-plate when not in said first position,
wherein

the roller element (107, 109, 111, 113) is supported on at least two spring elements
(120, 122) of differing characteristics, wherein the one spring element (122) has a

substantially constant stiffness and the other spring element (120) a variable stiffness,
and wherein the spring elements are mechanically connected to one another such that

when the roller element (107, 109, 111) is subjected to loading by the second rail part
(114) each spring element has a spring-capable state.
Roller device according to Claim 2,
wherein

the spring elements (120, 122) extend on opposite sides of a carrier element (128) and
are adjustable with variable distance to one another using a connecting element (130),

wherein the one spring element (120) having a damping effect and variable stiffness
runs on that side of the carrier element facing away from the second rail part such as a

tongue (114), wherein the spring element with the variable stiffness is drawn against 
the carrier element by the connecting element when the roller element (107, 109, 111)

is not subjected to loading such that a spring effect is ruled out or substantially ruled
out, and wherein when the roller element is subjected to loading each of the spring

elements has spring travel lengths accommodating usual additional loads and load
reliefs of the roller element.
Roller device according to at least one of the preceding claims,
wherein

the first rail part is a stock rail (10) or a wing rail and the second rail part is a switch
tongue (12) or a frog tip.
Roller device according to at least one of the preceding claims,
wherein

the roller element (107, 109, 111, 113) extends from a receptacle (115) inside which
the second rail part (114) can be immobilized in the non-contacting position, said

receptacle preferably extending indirectly or directly from the support, such as a
sleeper (110).
Roller device according to at least one of the preceding claims,
wherein

the spring elements (120, 122) are elastomer springs.
Roller device according to at least one of the preceding claims,
wherein

the spring elements (74, 76) extend from a carrier plate (78) movable inside a
receptacle (84) and positionable against a stop (100, 102), wherein the first spring

element (76) exercising a compression spring function runs between the carrier plate
and that bottom area (86) of the receptacle facing said carrier plate, wherein the second

spring element (74) substantially exercising a tension spring function runs between the
carrier plate and an element (88) that can be at a distance to the receptacle and

incorporates the guideway (56, 58), said second rail part (12) being capable of being
held down by the second spring element (74) in its contacting and non-contacting

positions and being supported by the spring element (76) in the intermediate position. 
Roller device according to at least one of the preceding claims,
wherein

the tension spring (74) has stored a potential energy in the clamped state that is equal
to or greater than the kinetic energy that can be introduced into the second rail part

(12) under normal conditions.
Roller device according to at least one of the preceding claims,
wherein

the second rail part (12) is held down on the sole-plate (18) by the roller element in its
contacting and non-contacting positions.
Roller device according to at least one of the preceding claims,
wherein

the roller element (14) extends from a holder that is connected to a support such as a
sleeper.
