<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel substituted
benzylamino nitrogen containing non-aromatic heterocycles,
pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and
the use of such compounds in the treatment and prevention of
inflammatory and central nervous system disorders, as well
as several other disorders. The pharmaceutically active
compounds of this invention are substance P receptor
antagonists. This invention also relates to novel
intermediates used in the synthesis of such substance P
receptor antagonists.Substance P is a naturally occurring undecapeptide
belonging to the tachykinin family of peptides, the latter
being named because of their prompt stimulatory action on
smooth muscle tissue. More specifically, substance P is a
pharmacologically active neuropeptide that is produced in
mammals and possesses a characteristic amino acid sequence
that is illustrated by D. F. Veber etal. in U.S. Patent No.
4,680,283. The wide involvement of substance P and other
tachykinins in the pathophysiology of numerous diseases has
been amply demonstrated in the art. For instance, substance
P has been shown to be involved in the transmission of pain
or migraine (see B.E.B. Sandberg etal., Journal of
Medicinal Chemistry, 25, 1009 (1982)), as well as in central
nervous system disorders such as anxiety and schizophrenia,
in respiratory and inflammatory diseases such as asthma and
rheumatoid arthritis, respectively, in rheumatic diseases
such as fibrositis, and in gastrointestinal disorders and
diseases of the GI tract such as ulcerative colitis and
Crohn's disease, etc. (see D. Regoli in "Trends in Cluster 
Headache," edited by F. Sicuteri etal., Elsevier Scientific
Publishers, Amsterdam, pp. 85-95 (1987)).Quinuclidine, piperidine, and azanorbornane derivatives
and related compounds that exhibit activity as substance P
receptor antagonists are referred to in United States Patent
