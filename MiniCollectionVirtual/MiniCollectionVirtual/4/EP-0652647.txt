<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of constructing a spreading code associated with a user of a direct-sequence code division multiple access digital transmission system. According to the invention, this method comprises at least one step of concatenation of several different subcodes (4), namely:   - at least two basic subcodes (1) which are different, particularly cyclically, and belong to the same family of basic subcodes; and - at least one secondary subcode (2) obtained by circular permutation of one of the said basic subcodes (1).
