<CLAIMS>
An organically bound mixture for friction linings for brake and clutch linings cooperating
with a friction partner of steel, comprising


aramide fibers,
organic and/or inorganic fillers,
lubricants,
organic binders, and/or
metals or metal compounds,

characterized in

that the mixture includes tin sulfides (SnS, SnS
2
) to reduce the susceptibility to rupture
of the friction partner, the tin sulfides being present in 0.5 to 10 percent by weight,

preferably 2 to 8 percent by weight.
The mixture for friction linings of claim 1, characterized in that the percentage

of metals is 0 to 70 percent by weight,
of fillers is 3 to 50 percent by weight,
of lubricants is 10 to 45 percent by weight, and
of organic additives is 3 to 25 percent by weight.
The mixture for friction linings, characterized in that the metal contained is steel
wool and/or copper wool. 
The mixture for friction linings according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the fillers contained are, either individually or in combination with other fillers,

metal oxides, metal silicates, and/or metal sulfates.
The mixture for friction linings according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that the lubricants contained are, either individually or in combination with other

lubricants, are graphite and/or coco powder, besides the tin sulfides (SnS, SnS
2
).
The mixture for friction linings according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that the organic additives contained are, either individually or in combination, resin

filler powders and/or binding resins.
The mixture for friction linings according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that


30 to 40 percent by weight are metals,
20 to 35 percent by weight are fillers,
20 to 30 percent by weight are solid lubricants, and
5 to 15 percent by weight are organic parts.
The mixture for friction linings according to claim 7, characterized in that

steel wool is present in a percentage of 15 to 25 percent by weight and copper wool
or copper powder is present in a percentage of 10 to 20 percent by weight,
aluminum oxide is present in a percentage of 0.5 to 2 percent by weight,
mica powder is present in a percentage of 5 to 8 percent by weight,
barite is present in a percentage of 5 to 15 percent by weight, 
iron oxide is present in a percentage of 5 to 15 percent by weight,
tin sulfides are present in a percentage of 2 to 8 percent by weight,
graphite is present in a percentage of 2 to 6 percent by weight,
coco powder is present in a percentage of 10 to 20 percent by weight,
aramide fibers are present in a percentage of 1 to 2 percent by weight,
resin filler powder is present in a percentage of 2 to 6 percent by weight, and
binding resin is present in a percentage of 3 to 7 percent by weight.
