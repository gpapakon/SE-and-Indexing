<ABSTRACT>
A recording and/or reproducing apparatus for a magneto-optical recording medium 
includes a semiconductor laser device (11) for radiating a laser beam to the magneto-optical 

recording medium, a driving circuit (12) for supplying a driving signal to the 
semiconductor laser device, a first oscillating circuit (13) for generating first high-frequency 

signals superposed on the driving signal from the driving circuit during 
recording on the magneto-optical recording medium, and a second oscillating circuit 

(18) for generating second high-frequency signals superposed on the driving signal from 
the driving circuit during reproduction from the magneto-optical recording medium. 

The first high-frequency signals are of a frequency twice the maximum recording 
frequency or higher, and the second high-frequency signals are of a frequency different 

from that of the first high-frequency signals. The semiconductor laser device is fed 
during recording and during reproduction with signals which are the driving signals 

from the driving circuit superposed on by the first high frequency signals from the first 
oscillating circuit and with signals which are the driving signals from the driving circuit 

superposed on by the second high frequency signals from the second oscillating circuit, 
respectively. During recording, a perpendicular magnetic field modulated in 

accordance with recording data is applied to the magneto-optical recording medium and 
simultaneously a light beam is radiated on the recording medium for recording data on 

the recording medium. During reproduction, as a light beam is radiated to the magneto-optical 
recording medium, data recorded on the magneto-optical recording medium are 

read out based on the return light from the recording medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a recording and/or reproducing apparatus for
recording desired information signals on a magneto-optical
recording medium by applying a magnetic field and simultaneously
radiating a light beam to the magneto-optical recording medium,
using a semiconductor laser device as a light source radiating
the light beam.As a recording medium for recording the information signals,
a magneto-optical disc has hitherto been employed, in which the
magneto-optical effects are utilized for recording the
information signals. The information signal recording system,
employing such magneto-optical disc as the recording medium, is
the magnetic field modulation system in which the direction of
the magnetic field to be applied to the disc is modulated in
accordance with the information signals desired to be recorded
on the disc.With the information signal recording system, employing the
magnetic field modulation system, a light beam emanated from a
semiconductor laser is continuously radiated on the magneto-optical
disc for heating a magnetic film area of the magneto-disc 
in which to record the information signals in order
to decrease the coercivity of the magnetic film area in which to
record the signals. An external magnetic field, having the
direction of the magnetic field modulated in accordance with the
information signals desired to be recorded, is applied to the
magnetic film area of the magneto-optical disc decreased in
coercivity with the aid of an electro-magnet. The direction of
the magnetic film of the magneto-optical disc area with decreased
coercivity is changed for recording desired information signals.For reproducing the information signals, thus recorded on
the magneto-optical disc as changes in the direction of
magnetization, the Kerr effect or the Faraday effect, relating
to the interaction between the light and the magnetism, is
utilized. When a light beam is incident on a magnetized member
in a direction parallel to its direction of magnetization, the
plane of polarization of the reflected light and that of the
transmitted light are rotated by angles of rotation which are the
Kerr rotation angle and the Faraday angle of rotation,
respectively. If the direction of the magnetic domains differs
with respect to the light incident direction, the difference in
the direction of rotation is produced. The difference in the
direction of the Kerr rotation angle of the reflected light is
read for reproducing the information signals.For such reproduction, there is induced a phenomenon in
which
