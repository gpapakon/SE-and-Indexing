<ABSTRACT>
To provide a resonant switching power supply switch 
with a simple structure and little noise, a push-pull 

resonant switching power supply circuit includes a 
transformer (104), a capacitor (105), two transistors 

(106a) and (106b) (bi-polar transistors or field effect 
transistors), and a bias circuit (201). The transformer 

(104) has a rectification circuit (340) connected to its 
secondary winding. The capacitor (105) forms a parallel 

resonant circuit in combination with the transformer (104). 
The transistors (106a) and (106b) are push-pull connected 

to the primary winding (104a, 104b) of the transformer 
(104) and their bases are connected to a feedback winding 

(104d) of the transformer. The bias circuit (201) applies 
a variable bias voltage to the base of the transistors 

(106).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a push-pull, resonant
type switching power supply circuit.An example of a conventional regulated power supply
circuit is the dropper type power supply circuit shown in
Fig. 1. The circuit is structured to obtain a high voltage.
An oscillator 320 converts d.c. input into a.c. output. A
transformer 330 boosts a.c. voltage and then a rectifying
circuit 340 converts the a.c. voltage into d.c. voltage and
outputs the latter. A constant-voltage control circuit 350
is connected between the output of the rectifying circuit
340 and a d.c. limiting element 310, wherein the d.c.
voltage output from the rectifying circuit 340 is compared
with a reference voltage supplied from a reference voltage
source 360. A current flowing from the d.c. limiting
element 310 to the oscillator 320 is controlled according
to the difference between the output of the rectifying
circuit 340 and the reference voltage. In this manner, an
output voltage dependent on the reference voltage can be
obtained.Fig. 2 shows an arrangement of another conventional
switching power supply circuit according to pulse-width
modulation (PWM) control. The inputted voltage is converted
into an a.c. voltage by repeatedly turning the switching
element 410 on and off. The a.c. voltage is boosted by the
main transformer. Afterward, the rectifying circuit 340
converts the a.c. voltage into a d.c. voltage and outputs
the latter. The constant-voltage control circuit 350
compares the output d.c. voltage with the reference voltage
supplied from a reference voltage source 360. The PWM
control 420, powered by an auxiliary power supply 430,
changes the switching pulse width in the switching element
10 in accordance with the difference between the d.c.
voltage from the rectifying circuit 340 and the reference
voltage. In this way, the a.c. voltage applied to a main 
transformer is controlled so that an output voltage
dependent on the reference voltage is obtained.Fig. 3 shows a specific example of a circuit structure.
In this example, a special-purpose IC chip is used on
the control and drives circuits 420, 350, and 360, and a
switching section 410 is constructed with a half bridge
circuit. Further, the power supply on the input side
converts an a.c. 100V into a d.c. voltage by a rectifying
and smoothing circuit 400. Another example is described in
reference 1: Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.
SHO-69-5353, which describes a circuit for suppressing
surge currents that occur during light loads and for
increasing conversion
