<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a DNA fragment, and
more particularly, it relates to a DNA fragment coding for a
thermostability-improved enzyme capable of converting D-N-carbamoyl-α-amino
acids into the corresponding D-α-amino
acids (hereinafter referred to as decarbamylase). The present
invention also relates to a process for preparing the DNA
fragment, a vector comprising the DNA fragment, a transformant
obtained by transformation with the vector, a decarbamylase
improved in thermostability and its production
process, and an improved process for producing amino acids
using the decarbamylase. The present invention further
relates to a method for increasing, by one or more, the
number of mutations in amino acids related to the thermostability
of a decarbamylase.Optically active D-α-amino acids are important compounds
as intermediates of medicaments, and in particular,
D-phenylglycine, D-parahydroxyphenylglycine and the like,
which are intermediates for the production of semi-synthetic
penicillins and semisynthetic sepharospolines, are useful
compounds from an industrial point of view. As the production
process for such D-α-amino acids, a process is known in
which these compounds are obtained by the removal of carbamoyl 
groups of the corresponding D-N-carbamoyl-α-amino acids,
wherein the removal of carbamoyl groups is effected by a
chemical method (the specification of the Japanese Patent
Publication No. 58-4707) or by the utilization of enzyme
reactions of microorganisms (the specifications of the Japanese
Patent Publication Nos. 57-18793, 63-20520 and 1-48758,
and the Japanese Patent Application No. 2-407922).However, because a mineral acid such as sulfuric acid
is used at great amounts in the chemical method employed for
the removal of carbamoyl groups, serious problems on the
environment may occur in relation to the treatment thereof
and the like. On the other hand, the method utilizing an
enzyme reaction has disadvantages that the amount of enzyme
produced is not satisfactory and there are some difficulties
in its properties even if mass production is made possible,
so that enzymes with reactivity to substrates and enzyme
stability have not yet been found.In general, some enzymes have poor stability, and when
such an enzyme is prepared, a stabilizing agent is added or a
means of preventing inactivation such as treatment at low
temperatures is employed. When an enzyme is used in an
actual reaction at ordinary or high temperatures, attention
will be directed to the stability of the enzyme. In
