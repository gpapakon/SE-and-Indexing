<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a machine room 
module for an elevator and to a procedure 

for installing it above the elevator 
shaft. According to the invention, the 

various pieces of equipment carried by 
the base (2) of the machine room module 

are fixedly mounted in their proper positions 
as required by the elevator construction, 

and the base (2) is provided 
at least with supporting elements (20,26, 

36) to support the base and to fix it on 
top of the elevator shaft (40). The 

module as a whole is positioned in the 
correct place in a horizontal plane above 

the shaft by means of positioning devices 
(38).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement for the
installation of the machine room of an elevator as defined
in the preamble of claim 1 and to a procedure for installing
the machine room as defined in the preamble of claim 8.In the case of traction sheave elevators, the machine room
is conventionally placed in a separate space above the elevator
shaft. The elevator ropes are passed into the shaft
via traction and diverting pulleys provided in the machine
room. The machine room contains a drive motor, possibly a
gear system connected to it, and the equipment for the supply
of power and control of the motor. During installation,
the various pieces of equipment are mounted in specific
locations in the machine room according to the requirements
of the elevator construction. Alternatively, the elevator
machinery is pre-installed on a base which is then placed on
top of the elevator shaft, whereupon the positions of the
various parts of the machinery are adjusted more accurately.The installation of the machine room equipment in the machine
room comprises several operations which are laborious
and time-consuming to carry out on site. The base of the
hoisting motor and the traction sheave have to be mounted in
place and their positions adjusted using a plumb line. The
vibration dampers and insulations have to be mounted and
adjusted. In addition, an overspeed governor and a control
unit are installed in the machine room. The hoisting motor
and the overspeed governor are connected to the control
unit. The cabling for the elevator car and shaft are installed
and passed into the shaft. A wooden locator is made for
the plumb lines of the shaft. Furthermore, the ropes are
mounted and the functions of the elevator are adjusted. Due
to the circumstances, it is difficult to achieve a good
installation result. Moreover, skilled persons of several
different specialties are needed for the installation of the
various components. Various elevator shafts of modular construction are also
known in the art. In these solutions, the machine room
consists of a shaft module mounted on top of the elevator
shaft. Such modules are not suited for elevator shafts built
separately on site, because the shaft wall dimensions are
not sufficiently accurate. US 3,519,101 shows a base for the components of an elevator
drive machinery. This base can be lifted stepwise according to
the construction progress of very high buildings. However,
after mounting this base in a working position the components
supported by said base have to be

<CLAIMS>
Method for installing the machine room module of an elevator,
said machine room comprising at least a base (2) and an

elevator drive machinery including at least a hoisting apparatus
with traction sheave (12) and a motor (8),characterized in

that the various components of the drive machinery carried by
the base (2) are fixedly mounted on the base (2) in their final

positions according to the requirements of the elevator construction,

that the base (2) is subsequently lifted onto the shaft (40),
and that the base (2) is positioned on the top of the shaft to

correct positions relative to the shaft (40) by use of positioning
devices in the kind of plumb lines (38).
Installation procedure according to claim 1, characterized
in that the base (2) is attached to the shaft walls

(44) so as to keep it in place in a horizontal plane.
Installation procedure according to claim 1, characterized
in that an elevator car and/or counterweight linked to

the drive machinery by a hoisting rope (13) is lifted
simultaneously with the base (2).
