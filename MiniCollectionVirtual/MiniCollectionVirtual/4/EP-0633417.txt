Throttling device for pulp slurries, with the following features:

1.1 a feed pipe is provided;
1.2 a discharge pipe is provided;
1.3 a spatially changeable hollow space is provided which
interconnects the feed pipe and the discharge pipe;
characterised by
 the following feature:

1.4 the hollow space is provided with a plurality of walls which
are displaceable into each other and which cause a

lengthening of the flow path when pushed into each other.
