<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drug material suitable for micronisation. In 
particular, the invention relates to a novel readily micronisable form of the 1-hydroxy-2-naphthalenecarboxylate 
(hereinafter hydroxy naphthoate) salt of 4-hydroxy-α1-[[[6-(4-phenylbutoxy)hexyl]amino]methyl]-1,3-benzenedimethanol 
(hereinafter compound A) and to processes for the preparation of this novel form. United Kingdom Patent Specification No. 2140800A (GB2140800A) relates 
to phenethanolamine derivatives having a selective stimulant action at beta-2 
adrenoreceptors. The compounds may be used inter alia in the treatment of 
respiratory diseases associated with reversible airways obstruction, such as asthma 
and chronic bronchitis. In particular, GB2140800A describes compound A and its 
physiologically acceptable salts, especially (at Example 20) its hydroxy naphthoate 
salt. Compound A and its hydroxy naphthoate salt have been found to be particularly 
advantageous in the treatment of such respiratory diseases. When treating patients suffering from respiratory conditions, it has been found 
most convenient to deliver the appropriate beta-2 stimulant directly to the site of 
action, either by inhalation or insufflation. In order to administer a drug via these 
routes, it is first necessary to provide the active ingredient as a fine powder having 
an appropriate particle size range. Material meeting the required particle size 
specification is generally obtained by micronisation of the drug substance, using, for 
example, a mill, such as a fluid-energy mill. The present inventors have found that when the hydroxy naphthoate salt of 
compound A is prepared as described in GB2140800A, Example 20, crystals are 
obtained that are extremely difficult to micronise to the required particle size range. 
These crystals are seen to adhere to the feed system (in the fluid energy mill) causing 
accumulation and ultimately blockage. This accumulation and blockage (of crystals) 
prevents efficient micronisation.  
 It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel, readily micronisable 
form of the hydroxy naphthoate salt of compound A that overcomes the 
disadvantage (in terms of micronisation) associated with the specific crystalline form 
described above. According to the present invention, there is provided the hydroxy naphthoate 
salt of compound A in the form of spherical accretions of microcrystals, the 
spherical accretions being free-flowing, friable and micronisable. The present inventors have surprisingly found
