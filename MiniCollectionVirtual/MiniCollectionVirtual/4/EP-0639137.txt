<ABSTRACT>
An improved package labeling apparatus of the type in which labeling information for a package (73) which is moving to a labeling station (51) is transmitted to the labeling station to control the application of the required label (191). The improvement comprises a carriage mounted printer-applicator assembly which responds to the labeling transmission, prints the label, moves to intercept the moving package and applies the label.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a movable label 
printer-applicator. More particularly, it relates to a label 
printer-applicator which is used in conjunction with a package 
conveyor system to print and apply labels to packages. Most 
particularly, the present application finds use in the 
application of bar coded shipping labels having one face 
coated with a pressure sensitive adhesive. Label applicators for applying labels to conveyor borne 
packages while they are in motion are known in the shipping 
industry. Known applicator systems remove a printed label 
from its backing strip and retain it against an applicator 
grid until the article to be labeled reaches an appropriate 
position on the conveyor. At that point, a blast of gas, such 
as air, is used to transfer the label from the grid to the 
surface of the article. A variation on the known systems is disclosed in U.S. 
Patent 4,255,220. This patent discloses a label applicator 
in which a label receiver is mounted for movement on a 
supporting structure. A printed label received from a label 
dispenser is releasably retained on the label receiver. This 
receiver moves from a retracted position to an extended 
position in close proximity to the article to be labeled. A 
blast of air is used to transfer the label to the package. 
The label receiver returns to the retracted or home position 
where it receives the next label from the label dispensing 
means and the sequence is repeated. Another labeling system is described in U.S. patent 
4,615,757. 
The preamble of claims 1 and 10 is based on this prior art. 
This patent discloses two labelers mounted over 
a conveyor for applying two labels to an article at the same 
time. Sensors detect the article width and both labelers are 
moved either toward or away from each other in the lateral, 
cross conveyor direction to position the label applicators  
 
along the sides of the article. Once positioned laterally, 
the first labeler utilizes a vertical, gravity biased 
applicator head which receives the label from a transfer 
nozzle and drops vertically to apply the label to the article 
by contact. The applicator is then raised to the home label 
receiving position to await the next label. The second 
labeler utilizes a pivotally mounted applicator arm which is 
gravity biased to a lowermost position and applies the label 
to the article by contact. While the systems described above are dependable and 
satisfactory for many labeling operations they have several 
problems. First, packages have to be

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (1) that applies labels to successive packages 
which are moving on a conveyor (3) past a labelling station (50) on the 

basis of a labelling information signal generated for each package, the 
apparatus (1) comprising a printer-applicator assembly (200) having a label 

application means (207,221), a sensor means (21,31,41) for determining 
package location and configuration data and a controller (13,160) for 

co-ordinating the package location and configuration data with labelling 
information to generate each labelling information signal, the apparatus (1) 

being characterised in that the printer-applicator assembly (200) also has a 
printing means (202,204) and in that the apparatus (1) further comprises a 

position sensor or sensors (157,179) by which the position of the printer-applicator 
assembly (200) may be ascertained, and driving means 

(150,178) to move the printer-applicator assembly (200) vertically and 
laterally, as required, whereby in response to the labelling information 

signal for a first package the printer-applicator assembly (200) moves to a 
first location and intercepts the first package as it travels on the conveyor 

past the labelling station (50), prints a first label, and applies the first label 
thereto, and in response to the labelling information for a next package the 

printer-applicator assembly (200) moves vertically and laterally, as 
required, directly from the first location as defined by the position sensor or 

sensors (157,179) to a next location, and intercepts and labels the next 
package as it travels on the conveyor. 
The system of claim 1, wherein the printer-applicator 
assembly (200) is mounted on a carriage assembly (170) and moves both 

vertically and laterally in a fixed plane normal to the conveyor (3) path. 
The system of claim 2 wherein linear actuators (146,147,172) 
move the carriage (170) mounted printer-applicator assembly (200) into 

position to intercept the packages.  
 
The system of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the 
printer-applicator assembly (200) prints the package label as it moves into 

position to intercept the packages. 
The system of any one of the preceding claims and claim 2, 
wherein a label supply reel (184), mounted on the carriage assembly (170), 

supplies blank labels to the printer-applicator assembly (200) and a take-up 

spool (185), mounted on the carriage assembly (170), collects the spent 
backing ribbon.

rotary encoded drive motor (150,157) powers vertically mounted linear 

actuators (146,147) and a rotary encoded drive motor (178,179) powers a 
horizontally mounted linear actuator (172); the encoded motors provide 

tracking data to the controller (13,160) which receives and correlates the 
data, and outputs control signals to accurately position the printer-applicator 

assembly (200) as it moves from a first label applying position 
directly to a next label applying position wherein the linear actuators
