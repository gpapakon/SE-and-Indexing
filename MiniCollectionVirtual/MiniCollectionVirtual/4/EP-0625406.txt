A method for the cutting surface working of a rotationally 
symmetrical body the outer layer of which consists of 

elastomers having a Shore hardness of 10 Shore A to 100 
Shore D wherein said rotationally symmetrical body is 

clamped in a machine tool and a high cycle motor spindle 
with a high speed cutter head is adjusted to the body, 

followed by treating the body by cutting with the indexable 
inserts of the rotating cutter head. 
The method according to claim 1, characterized in that said 
cutter head rotates at from 500 to 120,000 rpm around its 

longitudinal axis. 
The method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
said elastomer having a Shore hardness according to claim 

1 is the outer layer of a coated rotationally symmetrical 
body. 
The method according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the revolutions per minute of the body in the 

machine tool, the advance, the adjustment and the revolutions 
per minute of the cutter head are set independently 

of one another. 
The method according to claim 4, characterized in that a 
defined and reproducible geometry and surface roughness is 

adjusted.  
 
The method according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that 
the surface has approximately rhombic cups. 
The method according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the chips are sucked off centrally.
