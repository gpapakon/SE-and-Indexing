<DESCRIPTION>
 METHANESULPHONATEThis invention relates to a novel salt of 6-fluoro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-5-methyl-2- [(5-methyl-1M-imidazol-4-yl)methyl]-1 -pyrido[4,3-b]indol-1-one, to solvates of this salt, to pharmaceutical compositions containing it and to its use in medicine.6-Fluoro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-5-methyl-2-[(5-methyl-1Jd-imidazol-4-yl)methyl]-1 H- pyrido[4,3-b]indol-1-one, which may be represented by the formula (I)and its physiologically acceptable salts and solvates are described in European Patent Application publication No. 0353983. The compound of formula (I) is a potent and selective antagonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) at 5-HT3 receptors and is useful in the treatment of, for example, emesis (i.e. nausea and vomiting), irritable bowel syndrome and gastrointestinal dysfunction such as dyspepsia. Physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I) specifically disclosed in European Patent Application publication No. 0353983 are the male ate, benzoate and hydrochloride salts.We have now found, surprisingly, that a novel salt of the compound of formula (I), and solvates, particularly hydrates of this salt, more particularly its dihydrate, is advantageous for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions by virtue of its solubility and stability.The present invention therefore provides in a first aspect 6-fluoro-2, 3,4,5- tetrahydro-5-methyl-2-[(5-methyl-1JH[-iιnidazol-4-yl)methyl]-1]i-pyrido[4,3-b]indol- 1-one methanesulphonate and physiologically acceptable solvates thereof.Preferred solvates of the methanesulphonate salt of the compound of formula (I) are hydrates, in particular the dihydrate. 

 IThe preferred compound of the invention is 6-fluoro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-5- methyl-2-[(5-methyl-1JH-imidazol-4-yl)methyl]-1JH-pyrido[4,3-b]indol-1 -one methanesulphonate dihydrate.The potent and selective antagonism of 5-HT at 5-HT3 receptors by the compound of formula (I) has been demonstrated by its ability to inhibit 3-(5- methyl-1Jd-imidazol-4-yl)-1-[1-(methyl-t3)-1JH-indol-3-yl]-1-propanone binding in rat entorhinal cortex homogenates (following the general procedure described by G. Kilpatrick et al. in Nature, 1987, 330, 746).In view of its 5-HT3 antagonist activity, 6-fluoro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-5-methyl-2- [(5-methyl-1 -i idazol-4yl)methyl]-1ll-pyrido[4,3-b]indol-1 -one methane¬ sulphonate or a physiologically acceptable solvate is useful in the treatment of conditions ameliorated by antagonism of 5-HT at 5-HT3 receptors, such as emesis (i.e. nausea and vomiting), particularly that
