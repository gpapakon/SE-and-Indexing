<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a spray head (10) for processing liquid paints, having a housing with a longitudinally displaceable, rotating spray dome (12) with an end face (13), having a stationary protective casing which is described as a shroud and has an annular channel (16) which is at least partially open towards the spray dome (12) and is connected to a flushing-agent line (20), through which flushing agent can be fed to the spray dome (12) to clean the end face (13), at least one spray nozzle (22) being provided in the annular channel (16) for acting on the end face (13) of the spray dome (12) with flushing agent, and an orifice plate (26) being inserted in the annular channel.

Spray head (10) for the processing of liquid 
paints, with a housing possessing a rotating spray bell 

(12) having an end face (13), and with a rotationally 
fixed, longitudinally displaceable protective casing (14) 

designated as a shroud and having an annular duct (16) 
which is at least partially open towards the spray bell 

(12) and which has at least one spray nozzle (22) for 
acting on the end face (13) of the spray bell (12), the 

said spray nozzle being connected to a scavenging conduit 
(20), through which scavenging medium can be supplied in 

order to clean the end face (13), the protective casing 
(14) being retracted at least level with the end face 

(13) in the working position and being displaced into a 
position in front of the end face (13) in the cleaning 

position, characterized in that there is inserted into 
the annular duct a perforated diaphragm (26) which serves 

for distributing the scavenging medium, supplied to the 
annular duct, as uniformly as possible radially inwards 

towards the end face of the spray bell. 
Spray head according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the at least one spray nozzle (22) has an outlet 

orifice (24) which is arranged laterally in the nozzle 
body and the central axis of which is set at an angle to 

the longitudinal axis of the nozzle body. 
Spray head according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that a plurality of spray nozzles (22) are 

provided. 
Spray head according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the perforated diaphragm 

(26) inserted in the annular duct (16) is designed as a 
ring-shaped circular disc. 
Spray head according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the perforated diaphragm 

(26) is inserted into the annular duct (16) in such a way 
that the orifice (18) facing the spray bell (12), of the 

annular duct (16) is arranged above a radially inner 
annular bead (19) surrounding the perforated disc (26).  

 
Spray head (10) for the processing of liquid 
paints, with a housing possessing a rotating spray bell 

(12) having an end face (13), and with a rotationally 
fixed protective casing (14) designated as a shroud, 

which surrounds the spray bell (12) and which has an 
annular duct (16) which is at least partially open 

towards the spray bell (12) and has at least one spray 
nozzle (22) for acting on the end face (13) of the spray 

bell, the said spray nozzle being connected to a scavenging-medium 
conduit (20), through which scavenging medium 

can be supplied in order to clean the end face (13) of 
the spray bell (12), the protective casing (14) being 

retracted at least level with the end face (13) in the 
working position and being displaced into a position in 

front of the end face in the cleaning position, characterized 
in that the spray bell (12) is designed to be 

longitudinally displaceable relative to the protective 
casing (14), and in that a perforated diaphragm (26) is 

inserted into the annular duct.
