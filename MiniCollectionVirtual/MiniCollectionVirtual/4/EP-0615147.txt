<ABSTRACT>
It is possible to use an oriented monolayer to limit the Van der Waals forces 
between two elements by passiva
tion. The invention disclosed here details how to do 
so by building the device to be passivated (22), cleaning the surface to be passivated 

(24), activating the surface (26), heating it along with the material to be used as the 
monolayer (78), exposing a vapor of the material (30) to the surface and evacuating 

the excess material (32), leaving only the monolayer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention deals with micromechanical devices, more particularly with a
micromechanical device as defined in the precharacterizing
part of claim 2. Further, the invention relates to a method of forming protective coating on such a device.A micromechanical device as mentioned above is known from EP-A-0 510 629.
This document describes a micromechanical shutter device, wherein the deflectable
element has a vertical shutter attached to its underside. When the electrode is
addressed the movement of the deflectable element causes the shutter to raise
or lower. The device has no protective coating on it.There are many different types of micromechanical devices, three of which are
micro-motors, micro-gears, and micromechanical deformable mirror devices (DMD).
Micromechanical DMDs contain an activation or addressing electrode, a support post
or posts, underneath a hinge or hinges, which in turn supports a deflection element
suspended over the electrode. The DMDs are primarily used in the direction of light
in optical systems, with a mirrored deflection element.The operation of such devices involves activating the electrode which builds up
electrostatic charge in the gap between electrode and deflection element. The
deflection element then flexes on its hinge or hinges and moves towards the electrode.
When the charge is removed, the deflection element returns to its undeflected
position.Contact between the operating and supporting pieces of micromechanical
devices such as micro-gears and micro-motors may result in sticking. Likewise, if the
deflection element of a DMD comes into contact with the electrode, it may possibly
stick in the deflected position. One method of freeing the deflection element of a 
DMD is by the application of a voltage pulse train with a frequency around the
resonant frequency of the hinge. When the pulse train ceases, the deflection element
returns to its undeflected position.This method of reset works very well. However, after many contacts between
electrode and deflection element, the wear increases the effective contact area. This
requires higher and higher voltages for reset.The article "Formation of Highly Ordered Thin Films of Perfluorinated
Carboxylic Acids and Azobenzenes by Thermal Evaporation" of R. Jones
et al. in Thin Solid Films, Vol. 200, No. 2, 1991, pages 375-384,
reports that good-quality multilayers of perfluordecanoic acid can
be obtained by thermal evaporation. It is further mentioned that
monolayers of fluorocarbons have been formed by evaporation.

A method of forming protective coating on a micromechanical
device, comprising the steps of: manufacturing a

micromechanical device having a deflectable element (12)
suspended on hinges (14) over at least one address electrode

(10) and at least one landing electrode (18), such that when
said address electrode (10) is activated, said deflectable

element (12) deflects and comes to rest on said landing
electrode (18); depositing said protective coating on said

landing electrode (38) and said deflectable element (36) of
said micromechanical device to prevent sticking between said

landing electrode (38) and said deflectable element (36) of
said device, wherein before the step of depositing the surface to be coated is activated by placing the device into an oxygen plasma and then heated and

   said protective coating is formed by vapor depositing
of perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) to form an oriented

monolayer that prevents sticking and has high wear and
abrasion resistance.
A micromechanical device comprising: at least one address
electrode (10) on a substrate (20); at least on landing

electrode (18) on said substrate (20) adjacent said address
electrode (10); a support layer formed upon said substrate

(20) such that at least on gap exists in said layer exposing
said address electrode (10) and said landing electrode (18); 

at least one hinge (14) formed on said support layer such
that said hinge (14) is suspended over said gap; at least

one deflection element (12) formed upon said at least one
hinge (14), wherein said deflection element (12) is

positioned to be suspended over said gap; said device
further characterized by:

   an oriented monolayer of perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA)
formed upon said landing electrode (38) and said deflectable

element (36), such that when said address electrode is
activated and said deflection element twists about said

hinge and touches said landing electrode, said landing
electrode and said deflection element do not stick together,

and said monolayer does not wear or scratch off of said
landing electrode and said deflectable element.
