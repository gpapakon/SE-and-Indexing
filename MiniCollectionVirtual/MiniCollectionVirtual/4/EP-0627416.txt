<ABSTRACT>
To produce a prostaglandin E in a short time and in a high yield while minimizing the formation of isomers. A process for 
producing a prostaglandin E represented by general formula (I) wherein A represents an arbitrary group not participating in the 

reaction; B represents vinylene or ethynylene; R⁴ and R⁵ may be the same or different from each other and each represents 
hydrogen or a protective group for a hydroxyl group; and R⁶ and R⁷ represent each an arbitrary group not participating in 

the reaction, which comprises reacting an allyl ester of a prostaglandin E represented by general formula (II) wherein R¹ 
and R² may be the same or different from each other and each represents hydrogen or lower alkyl; R³ represents hydrogen, 

lower alkyl, alkenyl or aryl; and R⁴, R⁵, R⁶, R⁷, A and B are each as defined above, with one or two compounds selected 
from the group consisting of bases and formic acid in the presence of a complex compound or a complex salt of 0-valent 

or 
divalent palladium atom.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
preparing E-prostaglandins through the deallylation
reaction of allyl esters of E-prostaglandins.For the preparation of E-prostaglandins, a
method is commonly used in which E-prostaglandins
are extracted from the lower alkyl esters of E-prostaglandins.
However, since E-prostaglandins are
chemically labile and subject to dehydration reaction as
they have β-hydroxy-ketone in the skeleton, it is hardly
possible to apply the ordinary chemical techniques for
their preparation. Hydrolysis by use of an enzyme is
known as a most effective method for the preparation of
E-prostaglandins (JP-A-52-21392 and A. Hazato et al:
Hydrolysis of E-Prostaglandin Methyl Esters Using
Esterase, Bul. of Japan Chemical Society, Vol. 9, pp.
1390-1392, 1983).However, this hydrolytic method using an
enzyme has the disadvantage in that a great deal of time
is required for the reaction in the case of certain
types of E-prostaglandins. Further, in the preparation
of E-prostaglandins having the triple bonds at the 13-and
14-positions (the compounds of the formula (II) 
in which B is ethynylene group), which are among
prostagtandings E1, there would be produced the isomers
of the objective compound, such as 8-β compounds.As a result of intensive studies for solving
said problems, the present inventors found that when the
allyl esters of E-prostaglandins are subjected to a
deallylation reaction using a zero- or divalent palladium
complex or its salt as catalyst, it is possible
to produce the objective E-prostaglandins in a high
yield and in a short time with minimized formation of
isomers. The present invention has been attained on the
basis of this finding.The present invention provides a process for
preparing E-prostaglandins represented by the following
formula:

(wherein A, R6 and R7 are each an arbitrary group which
does not participate in the reaction; B is a vinylene or
ethynylene group; and R4 and R5 may be the same or 
different from each other and each represents a hydrogen
atom or a protective group of the hydroxyl group) which
comprises reacting the allyl esters of E-prostaglandins
represented by the following formula:

(wherein R1 and R2 may be the same or different from each
other and each represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl
group; R3 represents a hydrogen atom, a methyl
group, an alkenyl group or an aryl group; and A,
B, R4, R5, R6 and R7 are as defined above) with at least
one substance selected from the group consisting of organic
amines and ammonia and formic acid in the
