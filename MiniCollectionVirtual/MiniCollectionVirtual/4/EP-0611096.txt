<ABSTRACT>
When a lighter is not in use, a push-down member (41) is kept positioned on one 
end side of a lift-up lever (27) and has a lower end abutting against a lighter body (1) to 

set a locked state to restrict a push-down action. As the push-down member (41) is 
moved along the lift-up lever (27) toward the other end thereof, the locked state is 

released and the position of that movement of the push-down member (41) toward the 
other end of the lift-up lever (27) is maintained by its relationship with respect to the 

lighter body (1) or the lift-up lever (27). When the push-down member (41) is then 
pushed down, the lift-up lever (27) is rotated to open the valve means (9,15) and ignition 

means (17, 21, 25) is activated at a same time to ignite the fuel injected through the valve 
means (9,15). When that downward action of the push-down member (41) is released, the 

push-down member (41) moves upward to the original state while moving toward the one 
end of the lift-up lever (27) returning by the urging force of an elastic member (13) along 

the lift-up lever (27). Therefore, releasing of the locked state and ignition can both be 
accomplished merely by manipulating a single operating member, namely, the push-down 

member (41), and after the ignition, the push-down member (41) automatically returns to 
the locked state. It is therefore possible to significantly improve the operability of the 

lighter without deteriorating the safety function of its safety device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lighter for lighting cigarettes or like, for 
example, and, more particularly, to an improvement of a lighter which is equipped with a 
safety device to prevent small children from carelessly or accidentally igniting the lighter. Lighters for lighting cigarettes or the like are equipped with a so-called safety 
device. This measure is taken to prevent small children from easily igniting the lighter 
even through careless or accidental manipulation. Japanese Examined Patent Publication 
No. hei 3-501050 (U.S.P. Serial No. 5002482) discloses a lighter equipped with such a 
safety device. This lighter has a safety latch member attached under a push-down 
member, which is manipulated at the time of ignition, in such a way that the pressing 
action of the push-down member is selectively permitted by rotating this safety latch 
member in the proper direction. As the pressing action of the push-down member is 
restricted by the safety latch member, therefore, a small child cannot easily ignite the 
lighter even the child tries to do so. Another conventional lighter is disclosed in Japanese 
Unexamined Publication No. hei 4-363515. The conventional structure has the following shortcoming. The safety device of 
the above-described lighter is a manipulator provided separately from the push-down 
member that is manipulated to ignite the lighter in such a way that the separate 
manipulator should be manipulated to unlock the push-down member before manipulating 
the push-down member for ignition. In other words, once the lighter is locked, two 
different operating members must be operated separately to ignite the lighter. This  
 
demands the user of a troublesome manipulation, thus lowering the operability of the 
lighter. It is therefore an objective of the present invention to provide a lighter equipped 
with a safety device which can ensure sufficient safety without reducing the operability in 
actual use of the lighter. To achieve the foregoing object, the lighter of the present invention comprises a 
lighter body for storing fuel; valve means, attached to an upper portion of the lighter 
body, for stopping injection of the fuel when closed and permitting injection of the fuel 
when open; ignition means, provided at the upper portion of the lighter body and 
activatable as needed to ignite the fuel injected by opening of the valve means; lift-up 
means, arranged rotatable via a rotary shaft at the upper portion of the lighter body and 
having one end connected to the valve
