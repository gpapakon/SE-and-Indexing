<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a unitary wheel system for road vehicles, in particular passenger cars. In order to reduce the production outlay and stock holding for the wide variety of vehicle wheels of different diameters and widths which are still required today, a building block system is proposed which permits a single wheel with a small number of supplementary elements to be used on practically any passenger car which has a pitch circle diameter of 98 to 120 mm, specifically irrespective of whether it is a four-hole or five-hole connection and whether the wheel or its rim is screwed on with wheel bolts or a central blocking nut.

end of which is conically enlarged to enclose the grease fat cap (9) of the axle hub (8) of 

the vehicle and is provided with an attachment flange (16), the front end of which having 
an outer diameter corresponding generally to the inner diameter of the centric bore (48) 

of the wheel rim through which the hub adapter extends. 
Unitary wheel system according to one of the claims 1 - 4, characterized in that the 
cylindrical part (20) of the hub adapter (15) extending through the wheel rim is provided 

at its front end with a conical tap onto which the central closing nut (21) may be screwed 
located on a disc (23) inserted into the opening of the bore (48) of the wheel rim and that 

said front tapering end is a continuation in the direction of the rear end of the hub 
adapter (15) in form of an expanding cone (19) enclosing the grease cap (9) carrying an 

attachment flange (18).
