<ABSTRACT>
A low concentration (0.1 to 0.5 mM) of aluminum ions is 
added to an organic waste water to selectively raise specific 

bacteria which can grow without producing unpleasant odors. 
The bacteria is used for treating the organic waste water of 

high density without producing odors thus contributing to the 
minimum size of a waste water treatment system. Then, 

increase of the aluminum ions to a high concentration (more 
than 4 mM) accelerates flocculation and precipitation of the 

bacteria for disposal. When a proper mineral is added to the 
waste water, a lower concentration (more than 1 mM) of the 

aluminum ions can encourage the flocculation and 
precipitation of the bacteria and also, a resultant sludge 

will be reduced in amount for ease of maintenance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of decomposing
organic matter in waste water by means of the action of
specific microorganisms and more specifically, a biological
process for treating organic waste water with the use of
aluminum hydroxide films.For treating a particular waste water, e.g. domestic or
sanitary sewage, livestock waste, and industrial runoff,
which contains a substantial amount of organic matter (and
thus referred to as organic waste water), a variety of
methods have been proposed including physico-chemical
treatment and biological treatment. The activated sludge
process is more widely used as the most common biological
treatment than any physico-chemical treatment for treating
such organic waste water having high BOD (Biochemical Oxygen
Demand).The activated sludge process comprises raising bacteria
in an organic waste water, decomposing organic matter by the
action of the bacteria, and settling the bacteria to a form
of adhesive floc for obtaining a clear supernatant water.Although the activated sludge process is effective for
treating the organic waste water, it requires a sizable
system or facility for real operation. Also, highly condensed
waste water (more than 2,000 ppm of BOD) has to be diluted
with a large amount of water before the treatment. The
removal of sludge produced by the treatment has to be
repeated a considerable number of times thus increasing the
overall cost. Furthermore, the activated sludge process
produces unpleasant odors which may cause a public nuisance.It is an object of the present invention, for solving
the foregoing drawbacks of the conventional biological method
such as activated sludge process, to provide a novel 
biodegradation process of treating organic waste water in
which the organic waste water is treated without producing
unpleasant odors, even if the organic waste water is highly
condensed, it is treated without dilution, a resultant sludge
of biotic flocs is minimized in amount, and a large amount of
the waste water is treated with a relatively smaller size of
the system.For achievement of the above object of the present invention,
a biodegradation process of treating an organic
waste water is characterized by the features of independent
claim 1. More and particular features derive from the
dependent claims.The specific bacteria are used for decomposing the
organic matter in the waste water without producing
unpleasant odors. The specific bacteria unlike the known
bacteria increased in the conventional activated sludge
process can be

tank (1, 14) and including the steps of:

loading the first treatment tank (1, 14) with organic
waste water;
eliminating odor producing bacteria within the first
treatment tank (1, 14) through flocculation and

precipitation by adding aluminum ions to the organic
waste water so that their concentration is from 0.1 to

0.5 mM;
selecting, selectively raising and activating specific
