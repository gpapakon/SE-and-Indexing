<ABSTRACT>
The method for controlling frost formation on an evaporator (3) of 
a refrigerator (7) is based on the use of at least one sensor of 

capacitive type (10, 11) positioned at the evaporator (3), and 
comprises measuring and memorizing, subsequent to initial starting 

of the refrigerator and after each defrosting cycle (42) of the 
evaporator (3), an electrical signal (V
d
) generated by said 
capacitive sensor (10, 11) and comparing this memorized signal 

(V
d
) with actual electrical signals (V
F
) generated during the 
normal refrigeration cycle (41) following said defrosting (42), 

said cycle (41) being halted for subsequent defrosting (42) 
whenever the actual signals (V
F
) differ from the memorized signals 
(V
d
) by a predetermined percentage. The method is implemented by 
a control circuit comprising capacitive sensor means (10, 11) 

connected to control means (1) connected to means (15, 16) for 
measuring the temperature in the refrigerator compartments.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for controlling frost formation
on a refrigerator evaporator, with said evaporator there being
associated capacitive sensor means connected to evaporator
defrosting control means which activate a usual electrical
resistance element associated with said evaporator.From EP-A-0 563 751 in the name of the present applicant a
method and device are known for controlling frost formation on the
evaporator of a refrigerator (upright refrigerator, freezer or the
like) using capacitive sensor means associated with the
evaporator. Specifically, this method comprises measuring the
variation of an electrical signal generated by at least one
electrically powered capacitive conductor (8) associated with the
evaporator, and on the basis of this variation operating the usual
heating element associated with the evaporator for its defrosting.This method is implemented by a device comprising at least one
electrical conductor associated with the evaporator, means for
powering this conductor and means for controlling an electrical
signal generated by said conductor, said signal varying on the
basis of the frost present on the evaporator, said control means
comparing said signal with a reference value and acting on the
heating element on the basis of this comparison.With this method, the known device operates by comparing the
signal from the conductor or capacitive sensor with a
predetermined reference signal. This reference signal is chosen
on the basis of a particular distance between the sensor plates.Although this device operates substantially well, it has proved 
too sensitive to even minimum variations in the distance between
said plates, even though contained within tolerance limits. In
particular it has been found that during the use of the
refrigerator, even small differences between the distance between
plates and an optimum value result in mistaken intervention of the
defrosting control means on the heating element, this intervention
occurring either when there is no need or only after the formation
of a relatively thick layer of frost on the evaporator, according
to the particular circumstances.Another similar device is known from US-A-4 347 709, in which a high resistive epoxy resin hermetically seals a capacitive sensor plate disposed adjacent a surface of the evaporator.There has therefore arisen the need to preset the control means
for each particular refrigerator so as to regulate its operation
according to the actual distance between the plates of the
capacitive sensor

A method for controlling frost formation on a refrigerator
evaporator, with said evaporator there being associated capacitive

sensor means positioned at the evaporator of the refrigerator and connected to evaporator defrosting control means

with said evaporator following stoppage of the usual compressor,
characterised by measuring and memorizing, subsequent to initial

starting of the refrigerator (7) and after each defrosting cycle
(42) of the evaporator (3), an electrical signal (V
d

the capacitive sensor (10, 11) and comparing this memorized signal

(V
d
) with actual electrical signals (V
F

means (10, 11) during the use of the refrigerator (7) following

each defrosting cycle (42) or the initial starting, the
refrigerator (7) being halted for a subsequent defrosting cycle

during the starting cycle (40) of the refrigerator (7) the

evaporator temperature is measured and compared with a
predetermined temperature at which the frost on said evaporator

has at least largely melted, and if the measured temperature is
found to be greater than or equal to the predetermined

temperature, the electrical signal (V

latter.
method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
during the starting cycle (40) the evaporator temperature is

checked for minimum and maximum acceptable value, and when this
latter is achieved and exceeded the temperature in the freezer

compartment (8) is measured in order to decide whether or not to
start the operating cycle (41) of the refrigerator (7), ie its

refrigeration cycle.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that

checked for minimum acceptable value, and if this is attained the
temperature of the freezer compartment (8) is measured following

stoppage of the compressor (4), and if this is less than a minimum
acceptable value the evaporator heating element (2) is activated

predetermined value.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 4, characterised in that

numerical multiplier.
