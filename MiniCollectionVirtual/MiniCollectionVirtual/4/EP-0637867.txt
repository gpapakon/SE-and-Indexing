<ABSTRACT>
A cage rotor (10) 
includes a plurality of slots 

(16) for accommodating 
secondary conductors (18) 

along the periphery of a 
laminated core (14) fixed 

to a rotor shaft (12). The 
slots (16) pass through 

the core (14) in parallel 
with the rotor shaft, and 

their cross sections in 
a plane perpendicular 

to the rotor shaft are 
shaped substantially like 

an ellipse elongated along 
the periphery of the core, 

of which the major axis is 
D and the minor is d. To 

avoid stress concentration, 
the profile of the slot 

(16) has a shape such 
that tangential lines at 

given two adjacent points 
closest to the center of 

the core do not make an 
acute angle on the section 

perpendicular to the axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a squirrel-cage rotor for an
induction motor.A rotor for a high speed induction motor wherein an end ring
made of aluminium is cast by die casting on the outside of
each of both ends of a laminated rotor core is e.g. disclosed
in EP 0 341 317 A1. In a squirrel-cage rotor for an induction motor, a
laminated core made by stacking magnetic materials, such
as silicon steel plates, is provided with a plurality of
slots for disposing secondary conductors therein. These
slots axially extend along the outer circumferential
surface of the laminated core, and are arranged at
generally equal intervals in a circumferential direction.
Particularly, in a high-speed induction motor used as,
e.g., a spindle motor of a machine tool, the slots of a
rotor are formed as axial through holes which do not open
at the outer circumferential surface of a laminated core.
The slots shaped as through holes in a conventional
squirrel-cage rotor are generally provided with a
circular profile, or a generally elliptical profile of
which a major axis is oriented in the radial direction of
the laminated core, in a section orthogonal to the axis
of the rotor.When the squirrel-cage rotor rotates at high speed,
stress due to centrifugal force is caused in the
laminated core. This stress is concentrated particularly
on the minimum radius portions in relation to a center of
rotation, i.e., the innermost radial portions, of the
walls of the slots of the laminated core. If such a
stress concentration exceeds the elastic limit of the
material forming the laminated core, a permanent set or a
crazing arises on the radial innermost portions of the
slot walls of the laminated core. The degree of the
stress concentration becomes larger when the crossing
angle of the tangents on two given points adjacent to the 
radial innermost portion of each slot wall becomes
smaller in a section orthogonal to the axis.Even if the slots have sectional shapes which easily
lead to stress concentration on the radial innermost
portions of the slot walls, the stress concentration
caused on the slot walls during the high-speed rotation
of the rotor does not become very problematic, as long as
the diameter of the laminated core is relatively small.
However, in the case of a squirrel-cage rotor of a high-power
induction motor, having a laminated core with a
larger diameter, is rotated at high speed, the problem
arises in the slots having a circular section or a
generally elliptical section of which a major axis is
oriented in the radial
