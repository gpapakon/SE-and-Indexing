<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for controlling the execution of image 
processing operations carried out on an array of image signals, the specific 

operations having been identified by a plurality of predefined windows. 
The windows are divided into a plurality of regions, the boundaries of 

which correspond to transitions from one window region to another. Each 
region defines an exclusive region within the array of image signals, and 

the image processing operations to be applied to the signals within the 
boundaries of that region. The image processing operations are selected by 

decoding an effect data word that is assigned to each pixel and which 
follows the pixel along the image processing path. The bits within the 

effect data word are not assigned individual significance which allows the 
effect data word, in most cases, to maintain the same bit length even 

though additional image processing procedures or modules have been 
added to the image processing path. The apparatus is designed to 

efficiently manage the identification of regions while minimizing the bit 
length of the effect data word used to identify the image processing steps. 

The apparatus also provides flexibility of architecture design resulting in 
more efficient expansion of functions and easier modifications to existing 

functions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital signal processing apparatus to control digital
image processing operations.The features of the present invention may be used in the
printing arts, and more particularly, in digital image processing and
electrophotographic printing. In digital image processing, it is commonly
known that various image processing operations may be applied to specific
areas, windows, or pixels of an image. It is also known that the image
processing operations to be applied to individual pixels of the image may
be controlled or managed by a pixel location comparison scheme. in other
words, comparing the coordinate location of each pixel with a series of
window coordinate boundaries to determine within which window a pixel
lies. Once the window is determined, the appropriate processing operation
can be defined for the digital signal at that pixel location.Previously, various approaches have been devised for the control
of digital image processing and window management. These approaches
will be discussed in more detail below.US-A-4,760,463 to Nonoyama et al. discloses an image scanner
including an area designating section for designating a rectangular area on
an original and a scanning mode designating section for designating an
image scanning mode within and outside the rectangular area designated
by the area designating section. Rectangular areas are defined by
designating the coordinates of an upper left corner and a lower right
corner. Subsequently, counters are used for each area boundary, to
determine when the pixel being processed is within a specific area.US-A-4,780,709 to Randall discloses a display processor, suitable
for the display of multiple windows, in which a screen may be divided into a 
plurality of horizontal strips which may be a single pixel in height. Each
horizontal strip is divided into one or more rectangular tiles. The tiles and
strips are combined to form the viewing windows. Since the tiles may be a
single pixel in width, the viewing window may be arbitrarily shaped. The
individual strips are defined by a linked list of descriptors in memory, and
the descriptors are updated only when the the viewing windows on the
display are changed. During generation of the display, the display
processor reads the descriptors and fetches and displays the data in each
tile without the need to store it intermediately in bit map form.US-A-4,887,163 to Maeshima discloses an image processing
apparatus having a digitizing unit capable of designating desired areas in
an original
