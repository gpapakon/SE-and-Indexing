<ABSTRACT>
Applicant's invention includes an apparatus (10, 110, 210, 310) and associated method for treating or managing spinal deformities. For purely thoracic scoliosis, the apparatus is attachable to either first and second ribs (12) (for treatment of thoracic scoliosis) and a distal thoracic rib, or to a distal thoracic rib and an attachment point on the sacrum (212) for treatment of lumbar scoliosis.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for the treatment of diseases and symptoms
evidenced as deformities in the human skeletal systems and particularly for the treatment
of scoliosis.The human spine is a system which consists of a succession of vertebral bodies
which, in its normal state, extends within and defines a single sagittal plane. Ideally,
there should be substantially no deviation in the frontal plane (perpendicular to the sagittal
plane from a straight line. Within the sagittal plane, a certain degree of lumbar lordosis
and thoracic kyphosis is normal and desirable. An excess degree of lumbar curvature
is known as hyperlordosis, while an abnormally flat lumbar succession of vertebral
bodies is known as hypolordosis. In like manner, hyperkyphosis (most commonly seen
in Scheuermann's disease) is that condition evidenced by a greater-than-normal degree
of curvature in the thoracic spine which gives a hump-back type appearance.Scoliosis may be defined as lateral deviation and rotation of a series of vertebrae
from the midline anatomic position of the normal spine axis. The deformity occurs in
three planes - frontal, sagittal and transverse. Scoliosis, in its more severe embodiments,
is a debilitating, if not deadly disease. With the progression of the curve, structural
changes occur in the vertebrae and in the formation and contour of the rib cage.
This, in turn, often threatens respiratory function and capacity. The curvature of the
spine itself can pose danger to the spinal cord. Still further, the interrelationships between
other thoracic and abdominal organs are changes and the normal function
thereof is imperilled. Fully 80% of all scoliosis cases are idiopathic, i.e. the cause is cause
unknown.There is no present "cure" for scoliosis as such, but treatments of the symptoms
have been known for some time - treatments with often-times questionable effectiveness,
inherent intra-surgical danger to the patient, frequent patient discomfort and/or
substantial inconvenience, and substantial likelihood of post-operative complication.Non-surgical control of scoliosis (as distinguished from correction) is available.
Such non-surgical treatments include physical therapy, biofeedback, electrical stimulation 
and orthosis (the Sayre cast, the Hibbs and Risser casts, the Milwaukee brace, the
Boston brace and the Wilmington brace, for example). Reportedly, however, these
non-surgical methods can collectively boast, at most, only a 70% success rate in arresting
further progression of scoliosis in cases of

Apparatus for attachment between human ribs comprising a first element
(14, 18, 312) having a first attachment means (20, 110) for attachment to a first

human rib (12) and a second element (16, 218, 318) which is telescopically received
within a portion (18, 312) of the first element (14, 18, 312) and has a second attachment

means (20, 110, 214) for attachment to a second human rib (12) 
characterised in
that
 the apparatus is a thoracodorsal distractor (10, 210, 310) in which the first attachment
means (20, 110) is for attachment to a upper thoracic human rib (12) immediately

adjacent to the spine and the second attachment means (20, 110, 214) is for
attachment to a lower human rib (12) adjacent to the spine, a first upper length (14) of

the distractor (10) is contoured to define a first radius of curvature, and a second lower
length (16a) of the distractor (10) is contoured to define a second radius of curvature

which is larger than the first radius of curvature.
Apparatus, as in Claim 1, wherein each attachment means (20) comprises
at least one rod (20) affixed at the outer end of the respective element (14, 18,

312 or 16, 218, 318), each rod (20) being made of malleable material and being of a
length whereby it may be manipulated to loosely encircle a human rib (12).
Apparatus, as in Claim 1, wherein each attachment means (20) comprises
a pair of rods (20) affixed at the outer end of the respective element (14, 18,

312 or 16, 218, 318), each pair of rods being made of a malleable material and being
of a length whereby they may be manipulated to loosely encircle a human rib (12).
Apparatus, as in Claim 1, wherein the first attachment means (110)
comprises first and second members (112, 114) which are relatively movable between

a first position in which they define a closed circle of a size for loosely encircling the
human rib and a second position in which they define a broken circle having a breach of

sufficient size to admit the upper human rib (12).
Apparatus, as in any preceding claim, further comprising locking means
(32, 334, 342) for selectively arresting telescopic movement between the first element

(14, 18, 312) and the second element (16, 218, 318) at each of a plurality of post-operatively
selectable positions (26, 324). 
Apparatus, as in any preceding claim, further comprising at least one rib
sling (217) for attaching a medial portion of the apparatus to a third human rib underlying

the medial portion and for forcibly drawing a portion of the third rib to a position
adjacent to the apparatus.
Apparatus, as in any preceding claim, in which a rack and pinion system
(314, 320, 324) is operatively arranged to react between the first element (312) and

the second element (318) to adjust the spacing between the first attachment means
(20, 110) and the second attachment means (20, 110, 214).
Apparatus, as in Claim 7, in which the pinion (320) is removable after
the spacing has been adjusted.
Apparatus, as in Claim 7 or 8 including a locking means (334, 342) arranged
to lock the first element (312) and the second element (318) together after the

spacing between the first adjustment means (20, 110) and the second attachment
means (20, 110, 214) has been adjusted.
Apparatus, as in Claim 9, in which the locking means (334) is a ratchet
mechanism (334) which inhibits contraction of the distractor (10, 210, 310) whilst allowing

its extension.
Apparatus, as in Claim 9, in which the locking means (342) is a locking
disc (340) arranged to lock the first element (312) to the second element (318) at each

of a plurality of post-operatively selectable positions.
