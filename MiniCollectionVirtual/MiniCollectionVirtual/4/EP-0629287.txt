<ABSTRACT>
A leak detector for a plastics injection moulding machine comprises a small diameter conduit (20) located adjacent to a potential leak site on or associated with the machine, through which a regulated supply of air is emitted. When the conduit outlet (26) is blocked with leaked molten plastics, a sensor (45) in the conduit instantly detects a change in air flow or back pressure and triggers an alarm (65), and optionally cuts off the machine automatically to avoid damage to machine components and with the object of reducing machine down time. Changes in incoming primary air supply pressure may be detected to provide a fail-safe system. Alternatively, air pressure in the conduit (20) may be below zero, i.e. a vacuum, so that air is sucked into the conduit at its outlet (26). Several potential leak sites may be monitored simultaneously from a single sensor arrangement.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to 
a plastics injection moulding machine with a leak detektor and a system therefor, in particular, for 
leaks due to misalignment or wear of the nozzle and the mould in 
injection moulding of plastics, but also in hot runner injection 
systems or leaks of molten plastics material at any location or 
locations where rapid detection of leaking material is necessary to 
avoid machine down time. A problem arises in injection moulding with leakage at the interface of 
the mould and the nozzle of the injection moulding machine. Leakage 
arises if the nozzle and the sprue bush where the nozzle makes contact 
with the mould are misaligned or if wear has occurred to the nozzle or 
the sprue bush opening up an unacceptable clearance gap. The leakage of molten plastics material under pressure has many harmful 
effects and may occur as a slow creep or "drool" or as a rapid 
ballooning of sprue from the nozzle region. A decrease in the level of 
pressure inside the mould reduces the quality of the product being 
moulded by causing shrinkage. The leaking drool can short out heater 
bands, damage wires and terminals and destroy insulation blankets 
around the injection nozzle. The cost of spare parts and down time 
during repair is very high. There is also the increased risk to 
personal safety of machine operators. The solidified drool has an 
irregular surface and may have to be burnt off with a blow-lamp giving 
rise to smoke and poisonous fumes. It will be appreciated that the hot 
plastics material solidifies very quickly. There have been previous attempts to deal with the problem. One prior 
device supplied by Insul-Vest Inc. comprises a protective jacket which  
 
covers the nozzle and heater bands of the injection moulding machine 
such that when leakage occurs the drool spreads over the jacket and is 
prevented from spreading onto the rest of the machine. The jacket is 
made from material which allows the leaked drool to be removed easily. 
This device only seeks to limit the damage caused by the leakage. It 
ignores problems of material wastage and loss of pressure inside the 
mould causing subsequent deterioration in quality. Another approach, disclosed in US - 4,921,416, is to use a thermocouple 
which is positioned adjacent to the sprue bush and nozzle interface to 
detect abnormal changes in temperature caused by leakage. An 
electronic control unit linked to the thermocouple is adapted to give 
an alarm when a level of temperature outside the normal operating range 
is sensed.
