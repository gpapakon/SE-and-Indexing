<CLAIMS>
A triphendioxazine compound of the formula (1)


in which:

M
is hydrogen or an alkali metal; and
Z
is a radical of the formula (2)


in which

R
is hydrogen, sulfo, alkyl having 1 to 4
carbon atoms, alkoxy having 1 to 4

carbon atoms, nitro or cyano,
W
is alkylene having 3 to 6 carbon atoms
and
Y
is vinyl, or is ethyl which is
substituted in the β-position by a

substituent which can be eliminated 
under the action of alkali to form the

vinyl group.
A compound as claimed in claim 1, in which R is
hydrogen or sulfo.
A compound as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which W
is 1,3-propylene or 2-methyl-1,2-ethylene.
A compound as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 3, in which Y is vinyl, β-chloroethyl or

β-sulfatoethyl.
A compound as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 3, in which Y is β-sulfatoethyl.
A compound as claimed in claim 1 of the formula


in which M and Y have the meanings given in claim
1.
A compound as claimed in claim 6, in which Y is
β-sulfatoethyl.
A process for the preparation of a
triphendioxazine compound of the formula (1) of

claim 1, which comprises reacting a compound of
the formula (3) 



where M has the meaning given in claim 1, with an
amino compound of the formula (4)



in which R, W and Y have the meanings given in
claim 1, in an aqueous or aqueous-organic medium

at a pH of between 3 and 9 and at a temperature of
between 25 and 100°C.
A mixture of one or more triphendioxazine
compounds of the formula (1) of claim 1 with one

or more blue-dyeing compounds of different
structure from the disazo, copper formazan,

triphendioxazine and anthraquinone series.
The use of a triphendioxazine compound of the
formula (1) of claim 1 or of a mixture of claim 9

for dyeing material, in particular fiber material,
containing hydroxyl and/or carboxamide groups.
A process for dyeing material, preferably fiber
material, containing hydroxyl and/or carboxamide

groups, in which a dyestuff or a dyestuff mixture
is brought into contact with the material in an 

aqueous medium and fixing of the dyestuff or
dyestuffs on the material is carried out by means

of heat or with the aid of an agent having an
alkaline action or with the aid of both measures,

wherein the dyestuff or the mixture of dyestuffs
is a triphendioxazine compound of the formula (1)

of claim 1 or a mixture as claimed in claim 9.
The process as claimed in claim 11, wherein the
process for dyeing is an exhaustion dyeing process

and the dye liquor has a total electrolyte salt
content of 20 to 40 g/l of dye liquor.
