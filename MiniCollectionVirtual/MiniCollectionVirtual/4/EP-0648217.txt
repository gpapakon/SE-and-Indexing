<DESCRIPTION>
 NOVEL SUCROSE LIGANDS, METHODS FOR THEIR PREPARATION,PLATINUM COMPLEXES DERIVED THEREFROM,AND METHODS FOR THEIR USAGERelated Applications There are no related applications.Field of the Invention The subject invention relates to novel sucrose ligands, methods for their preparation and the use thereof for co plexation with metals or metal bearing compounds such as cisplatinum. The invention also relates to the use of these novel sucrose ligands as food bulking agents and to make acrylamide and methacrylamide crosslinking agents. The subject invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing mono(platinum) , bis(platinum) , and tris(platinum) complexes derived from these sucrose ligands and the use thereof in the treatment of cancers including testicular cancer, or as sensitizers for radiation therapy and during imaging of pathological tissues.Background of the Invention The synthesis of sucrose derivatives and improved methods for synthesizing sucrose derivatives is an area of significant research given the abundance and inexpense of sucrose and its suitability as a starting material for making many different biologically and industrially useful compounds. 

 For example, amino sugars are well known components of antibiotics and antibacterial polysaccharides. Additionally, sucrose derivatives have recently been used to make monomers and polymers from sucrose. See, e.g-., Fritschela et al., European Patent 0218150 (1987); Khan et al.. Carbohydrate Research (1980), pp. 185-189; and commonly assigned United States Patent Application No. 07/877,813, filed on May 4, 1992, Docket No. 011370-008.Thus, given the known biological and industrial applicability of sucrose derivatives, methods for providing novel sucrose derivatives and methods for their usage would be highly desirable.Cis-diaminedichloroplatinum (II) , cis-DDP, or cisplatin as it is commonly known in the art, is a platinum complex which was first prepared by Alfred Werner in 1893 fz Anorq. Chem.. 1893, 3,267). However, this compound was only of interest to inorganic chemists until Rosenberg and colleagues discovered in 1965 that this complex and several related complexes, specifically cis, cis-diamine-dichloro- trans-dihydroxoplatinum (IV) and cis-cis-trans-dia ine- tetrachloroplatinum (IV) have the ability to prevent DNA replication in Ej_ coli and that such complexes may be used as antineoplastic agents. (It was found, however, that transplatin or trans-diamine-dichloroplatinum (II) , a related complex, does not comprise this
