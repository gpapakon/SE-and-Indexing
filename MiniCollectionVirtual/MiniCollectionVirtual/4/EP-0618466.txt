<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for imparting an angle 
cleave to a plurality of optical fibers. The cleaving 

device comprises a base having a support surface, the 
support surface having two lower pads which are aligned 

with two upper pads on a hinged cover, so that the fibers 
may be clamped between the respective pairs of lower and 

upper pads. One of the upper pads is designed to shift 
with respect to its corresponding lower pad; when a fiber 

is clamped between these pads and the upper pad moves, 
the fibers twist as a result of the induced torsional 

load. When the fibers are scored and cleaved while in 
the twisted state, the resulting end faces are at an 

oblique angle with respect to the fiber axes, which is 
beneficial since this reduces signal reflections at the 

fiber-to-fiber interfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the
interconnection of optical fibers, and more particularly
to a device for simultaneously cleaving the
end portions of a plurality of optical fibers, and
imparting an oblique angled finish to the end portions.In recent years, fiber optic cables have
replaced traditional copper wire as the preferred medium
for telecommunications. As with copper wires, it is
necessary to provide cross-connections and
interconnections between optical fibers at various
locations in the distribution system. This is typically
accomplished with the use of an optical fiber connector
or splice, but it is first necessary to prepare the
terminal ends of the fibers being spliced. The prior art
techniques for fiber preparation include cleaving the end
of the fiber to provide a planar finish perpendicular to
the fiber axis, which minimizes insertion losses
associated with irregularities on the fiber end face.
Early prior art cleaving devices were designed to cleave
a single (discrete) fiber; later devices allow for the
simultaneous cleaving of multiple fibers, for example,
fibers which have been formed into a fiber ribbon. One
such exemplary prior art cleaving device 1 is shown in
Figure 1, and is described in further detail in
US-A-5,024,363.The prior art multi-fiber cleaver 1 is
generally comprised of a base 2 having a support surface
3 for receiving the fibers, and a scribing wheel 4 which
moves transversely with respect to the fiber axes.
Support surface 3 includes a guide ramp 5 for receiving a
fiber holder, and a pair of clamping pads 6. Pads 6 are
aligned with another pair of pads 7 on a lid or clamp
cover 8 which is hinged to an edge of support surface 3.
The fibers to be cleaved are set on support surface 3, 
with their terminal ends overlying pads 6; the fibers are
securely held in place between pads 6 and 7 when cover 8
is pushed against surface 3. Then, as scribing wheel 4
slides transversly along base 2, it produces a score line
on each of the fibers. The cleaving operation is
completed by pivoting an arm 9 downward, causing a
pushing member or anvil 10 at the end of arm 9 to break
the fibers at the score lines.The prior art cleaver 1 simplifies the cleaving
operation by making it possible to simultaneously cleave
all of the fibers at once, and also ensures that each of
the fibers is cleaved at the same relative location,
i.e., the terminal portions of the fibers have the same
length. It may be noted that this cleaver may be used
for both fusion splicing and mechanical

<CLAIMS>
Device for forming an oblique cleaved end face through
an end portion of at least one optical fiber, comprising


a base (22) having a support surface (24), said
support surface (24) having first and second

pads (36, 38) spaced apart along a predetermined longitudinal
direction,
a cover member (26) attached to said base (22),
said cover member (26) being movable between

open and closed positions and including third
and fourth pads (40, 42) also spaced apart along said longitudinal direction so as to forcibly abut said

first and second pads (36,38), respectively,
when said cover member (26) is in said closed

position, in order to clamp any fiber end portion longitudinally
disposed therebetween,
a carriage (48) tranversally slidably attached to said cover
member (26), said fourth pad (42) being affixed

to said carriage (48),
means for transversally sliding said carriage so as to correspondingly shift said fourth pad with respect
to said second pad such that the fiber end portion clamped

therebetween will be placed under a torsional
load, and
means (28), attached to said base (22) and
located between said first and second pads

(36, 38), for scoring the clamped und torsioned fiber end portion in order to form
an oblique cleaved end face therethrough,
wherein said carriage sliding means comprises a screw
(56) and a biasing spring (54) arranged at

opposite ends of said carriage (48), wherein a
tip (58) of said screw (56) and said biasing

spring (54) both contact said carriage (48) so
that rotation of said screw (56) in a first

rotational direction causes movement of said
carriage (48) against said biasing spring (54)

and rotation of said screw (56) in a second
rotational direction causes the biasing spring

(54) to move said carriage (48) against the tip
(58) of said screw (56).
Device according to claim 1 wherein
said screw (56) is provided with a handle (60)

arranged at its end opposite the tip (58) for
facilitating rotation of said screw (56).
Device according to claim 1 or 2 wherein
that said cover member (26) has a transverse slot (50) therein

for receiving said carriage (48), said slot (50)
and said carriage (48) forming a dovetail joint.
