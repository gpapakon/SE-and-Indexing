<ABSTRACT>
A sampling probe is provided for sampling the exhaust gases of internal combustion engines, particularly commercial vehicles. The probe includes a sampling tube (11) having an inlet (12) at one end for receiving the gaseous products. The tube (11) is pivoted to an arm (17) at an outer end of the arm so that the sampling tube (11) can move relative to the arm (17) and manipulate the position of the inlet (12) and insert the inlet (12) into a gas outlet tube (30). The arm may be clamped to the gas outlet tube by a clamping arrangement (26-29) operated from the end of the arm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sampling probes for 
use for gaseous products, for example, in sampling the exhaust gases of engines. Road vehicle exhaust gases need to be sampled to establish whether they comply with 
requirements that they be clean, but to gain access to the exhaust outlet for such gases is not 
always easy. This is particularly the case with goods vehicles. There has been proposed in US-A-3,481,200 an exhaust gas sampler which includes a 
sampling tube having an inlet for gaseous products, the inlet being located towards the outer 
end of the tube. The tube also includes a flexible portion. The tube may be clamped in 
position in an exhaust pipe for sampling purposes but must be manually inserted from close 
to the exhaust pipe. In DE-A-2833340 there is described a suction device for extracting exhaust gases from 
exhaust pipes having a rigid pipe with a valve and with a clamp for clamping the pipe onto 
an exhaust pipe. The pipe through which the exhaust gases are taken is flexible and is 
suspended from an arm which takes the weight of the tube during operation. It is an object of the invention to provide a sampling probe by which samples of gaseous 
products may be taken from relatively inaccessible outlet positions. According to the present invention there is provided pivot means connecting the tube and the 
arm and located towards the outer end of the arm. A handle is provided towards the inner 
end of the arm and the tube is pivotable relative to the arm about said pivot means to 
manipulate the position of the sampling tube inlet by relative movement between the arm and 
the tube, said sampling tube having a portion extending outwardly of the pivot means and 
containing the inlet. The flexible portion of the tube is located inwardly of the pivot means 
and the arrangement enables the outer end of the tube to be moved relative to the arm. This 
arrangement enables the inlet for gaseous products to be manipulated remotely from the inlet  
 
end by the use of the arm whilst grasping its handle. Preferably the probe includes clamping means located towards the outer end of the arm 
whereby the probe is clamped to an outlet for gaseous products to be sampled. Conveniently the clamping means is operable remotely from said outer end of the arm by 
operating means and said operating means is located adjacent a handle at said inner end of 
said arm. The clamping means may include clamping surfaces resiliently urged towards one another, 
the surfaces being movable apart by said operating

<CLAIMS>
A sampling probe for gaseous products comprising a sampling tube (11) having an 
inlet (12) for gaseous products, said inlet being located towards an outer end of the tube and 

the sampling tube (11) having a flexible portion (14), an arm (17) for supporting the tube (11) 

and having an inner end and an outer end, characterised by pivot means (21) connecting the 
tube (11) and the arm (17) and located towards the outer end of the arm, and a handle (18) 

located towards the inner end of the arm, the tube being pivotable relative to the arm about 
said pivot means (21) to manipulate the position of the sampling tube inlet (12) by relative 

movement between the arm and the tube, said sampling tube having a portion (13) extending 
outwardly of said pivot means and containing said inlet (12), the flexible portion (14) of the 

tube being located inwardly of the pivot means (21), the arrangement enabling the outer end 
of the tube (11) to be movable relative to the arm (17). 
A sampling probe according to claim 1 comprising clamping means (20) located 
towards the outer end of the arm (17) whereby the probe is clamped to an outlet (30) for gaseous 

products to be sampled. 
A sampling probe according to claim 2 wherein the clamping means (20) is operable 
remotely from said outer end of the arm by operating means (24), and said operating means 

is located adjacent the handle (18) at said inner end of said arm. 
A sampling probe according to claim 2 or 3 wherein said clamping means (20) 
includes clamping surfaces (28,29) resiliently urged towards one another, the surfaces being 

movable apart by said operating means (24). 
A sampling probe according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the sampling 
tube (11) is connected to measuring means whereby the smoke content of the gaseous 

products is measurable.  
 
A sampling probe according to any one of the preceding claims comprising a rigid 
portion (13) of the sampling tube (11) associated with the pivot means (21). 
A sampling probe according to claim 6 wherein the length of said rigid portion (13), 
the location of said tube inlet (12), the position of said pivot means (21) and the length of the 

arm (17) are arranged to enable the inlet end (12) to be inserted into a tubular member 
through which the gaseous products are discharged and in which said products are sampled 

by admission of the products into said inlet end (12) for passage along the tube (11) to 
measuring means, the tubular member being clampable to said arm (17).
