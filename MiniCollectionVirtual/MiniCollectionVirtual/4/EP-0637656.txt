<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to trusses, and more
particularly to trusses fabricated of cold rolled sheet
metal structural members.EP-A-0446158 discloses a sheet metal frame structure
comprising a central bore and two lateral supporting wings
on either side of the bore. The lateral supporting wings
are symmetrical with respect to the bore.US-A-4389829,
which represents the closest prior art
discloses a roof system wherein an upper and
a lower chord member
are connected by sheet metal web members. The web
members contain a pair of channel-shaped mounting flanges,
one of which is adapted to pass over and be sealed upon the
upper chord member, the other passes over the lower chord member.Among the several objects of the invention may be
noted the provision of a truss fabricated of cold rolled
sheet metal structural members having an upper chord, a
lower chord and web members extending between the chords,
wherein the upper chord and the lower chord comprise chord
members which are adapted to lie flat for facilitating the
fabrication of the truss; the provision of such a truss
wherein the upper chord comprises two chord members and the
lower chord comprises at least one chord member, with two of
the upper chord members inclined upwardly from the heels or
lower outer ends of the truss, and with each of the upper
and lower chord members being formed of sheet metal and
having a cross-sectional shape that significantly reduces
the effect of torsional buckling under dead load, reduces
eccentricity at the joints, and reduces lateral and
torsional buckling from live loads during and after erection
of the truss; the provision of a truss construction that
allows for a plurality of trusses to be stacked flatwise one
upon another and bundled for transportation and delivery in
an 
efficient and safe manner without special spacer blocks
or wasted space between trusses in the stack, similar to
the manner and in bundles of comparable size to those in
which present wood trusses may be stacked; the provision
of such a construction for a truss which may be referred
to as an "in plane" construction, allowing for easy and
efficient fabrication of gable trusses (trusses with a
peak such as king-post and scissors trusses), and
parallel chord trusses (trusses with a top chord member
extending substantially parallel to the bottom chord),
and for easy and efficient attachment of sheathing or
decking to the trusses as erected; the provision of such
a truss which has a pleasing appearance, having a "clean
look"; the provision of such a
