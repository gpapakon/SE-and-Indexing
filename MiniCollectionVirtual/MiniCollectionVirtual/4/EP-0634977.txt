<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for looseleaf 
binding of papers and documents. Hitherto, page materials requiring to be 
looseleaf bound have, after suitable drilling or punching, 
been held together using an openable multi-ring device 
attached to a pre-formed spine and cover assembly. The 
disadvantage of the existing arrangement is that the device 
is usually manufactured from metal and includes a spring 
device which is riveted to the spine and covers, making the 
total cost of this binding device relatively expensive. It 
is also normal for the covers of this binding means to be 
titled to match the intended contents, making the binder 
redundant should a different content be required. It is an object of this invention to provide a 
relatively low cost looseleaf binding system which permits 
the rapid and secure binding of prepared pages, and the 
easy subsequent removal or addition of pages. A secondary 
object of this invention is to provide flexibility of use 
by permitting the binding of covers as well as pages, so 
that the covers and not the binding means relate to the 
content of the assembled document, allowing the use of 
one looseleaf binding means for a range of documents.  
 Looseleaf binding devices are shown in US-A-3057357 
and US-A-3183913. Several embodiments of device 
are shown in US-A-3057357 but all are either complex 
integral mouldings or are assembled from separate 
components utilizing ball-and-socket type joints. Whilst 
the ball-and-socket embodiments avoid the problems of the 
relatively complex tooling necessary to produce the moulded 
embodiments, the ball-and-socket arrangements are not well 
adapted to resisting shock loading as would occur if a 
sheaf of bound documents is dropped. Under such loading 
conditions the ball will tend to pop out of the 
corresponding socket with the resultant failure of the 
device. The device of US-A-3183913 requires, in addition 
to two separate spine members, a base member which holds 
the spine members and controls movement thereof. This 
additional component adds to the cost and weight of the 
device. Also, the device illustrated is liable to snap 
over-centre into its release configuration in the event of 
shock loading of the type referred to above. The present invention provides a looseleaf 
binding device of the type referred to in the pre-characterising 
portion of claim 1 which is characterised in 
that the interengaging components comprise a plurality of 
tongue-like projections formed integrally with one of the 
elongate
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A looseleaf binding device comprising: first and 
second separately formed elongate spine members (14a,14b) 

hingeable relative to each other and connected to each 
other by respective interengaging components (24,26) of the 

spine members, a plurality of first finger members (4) 
extending forwardly from the first spine member (14a) on 

one side of the hinge (25); a plurality of cooperating 
second finger members (4a) extending forwardly from the 

second spine member (14b) on the other side of the hinge 
(25); first and second extensions (7,7a) projecting 

rearwardly respectively from the first and second spine 
members (14a,14b) on either side of the hinge (25), the 

device being hingeably movable between an open 
configuration in which the free ends of the finger members 

(4,4a) are spaced apart and a closed configuration in which 
the fre
e ends of the cooperating first and second finger 
members (4,4a) meet to form a plurality of closed loops 

through holes in a sheaf of looseleaf papers to be bound 
and in which the connection formed by the interengaging 

components (24,26) is loaded in tension; and a locking 
member (18) positionable to lock the first and second 

extensions (7,7a) in the position corresponding to the 
closed configuration of the device to hold the device in 

the closed configuration; 
characterised in that
 said 
interengaging components comprise a plurality of tongue-like 

projections (24) formed integrally with one of the 
elongate members (14a) and a plurality of apertures defined 

by the other of the elongate members (14b) for receiving 
said tongue-like projections (24) to secure the elongate 

members (14a,14b) together, said tongue-like projections 
(24) each being connected to the remainder of the elongate 

member (14a) with which they are formed by means of a hinge 
portion (25), the hinge portions of the tongue-like  

 
projections (24) cooperating to form said hinge; and said 

tongue-like projections (24) each have a tapered lead-in 
region and a barb so that the tongue-like projections (24) 

may readily be inserted into the corresponding apertures 
until the barbs snap behind means (26) defining the 

apertures thereby inhibiting removal of the tongue-like 
projection (24) from the apertures.  

 
A binding device according to claim 1 

characterised in that
 each of said apertures is formed in a 
generally U-shaped bar (26) moulded integrally with a spine 

portion (14b) of its associated elongate member (23). 
A binding device according to claim 1 or 
claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the locking member (18) is 
pivotably attached to one (7a) of said first and second 

extensions along one longitudinal edge thereof, the locking 
member being pivotable between a first, free position, and 

a second locking position in which the locking member 
engages with the other (7) of said first and second 

extensions to hold the device in the closed configuration. 
A binding device according to claim 3, 

characterised in that
 said locking member (18) is formed 
integrally with the extension (7a) and is connected to the 

extension by an integral hinge which provides the pivotal 
attachment. 
A binding device according to any preceding claim 

characterised in that
 said locking member (18) is 
releasable from its operative position to permit the 

elongate members (22,23) to be hinged about said hinge 
thereby moving the free ends of the fingers (4,4a) away 

from each other to facilitate removal of or insertion of 
papers to said binding device.
