<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to machines used 
in performing railway right-of-way maintenance, and 
specifically to a machine for driving railroad rail 
fasteners such as lag screws or nuts into or onto railroad 
track ties using an axially rotatable motion. Conventional railroad rails are secured to the 
ties by so-called cut spikes which are driven by vertically 
directed forces through tie plate apertures into the wooden 
railroad ties. However, it has been found that certain 
portions of track, such as those bearing high tonnage 
traffic, as well as curved track sections, wear out faster 
than others, and require more frequent replacement. A side 
effect of frequent rail replacement is that the spikes have 
a tendency to loosen in the ties, especially in high 
tonnage sections of track. As a result of these conditions, maintenance 
directors of railroads have determined that alternate 
fastening technologies to cut spikes should be explored. 
One alternative is to use so-called hairpin spikes, which 
have depending prongs designed to spread apart within the 
tie. Although hairpin spikes are used in some high traffic 
portions of track, they are somewhat limited in their 
application, in that such spikes are more difficult to 
drive into and pull from the ties using automatic 
equipment. Another type of fastener which is being 
considered is the rail lag screw, which is similar in 
dimension to a cut spike, with the major difference being 
that the lag screw is designed to be axially rotated in the 
tie. As such the lag screw has a threaded shank and a 
polygonal head for engagement by driving tools. Yet another type of alternate rail fastening 
system employs relatively permanent concrete ties having 
threaded studs embedded therein for securing the rails.  
 
Upon placement of a rail on the concrete ties, nuts are 
threaded onto the studs to secure the rail. One other type 
of fastener is a releasable clip, which is also preferably 
used with concrete ties. A conventional technique for driving rail lag 
screws employs a hand-held rotary impact wrench which 
engages the head of the spike and can either drive or 
remove the lag screw at the direction of the operator. 
However, a major drawback of this technique is that during 
placement, either two operators are required, e.g. one to 
place the screws and one to operate the impact wrench, or 
a single operator must perform both tasks at an appreciably 
slower pace. Either way, this technique is inefficient and 
labor intensive. Designers of

characterized by said drive means including an extension 

member (108) depending from a drive unit (106) and disposed 
relative to said retaining means for engaging the at least 

one fastener, and upon engagement of the at least one 
fastener, said extension member being permitted a specified 

amount of radial deflection relative to said retaining 
means for locating the fastener relative to the track 

support member.
