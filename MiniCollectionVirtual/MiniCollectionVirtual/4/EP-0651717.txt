<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to a merchandise container formed from folded flexible sheet material to provide a box form having side/end walls (10, 11) and a top closure (13), in which the top closure comprises integral flaps (17, 19) on the side/end walls which fold with respect to each other and the walls. The end walls (13-17) being pre-formed to bow inwardly such that when the side wall flaps (17a, 17b) are folded in overlapping relation to form the top closure, the end wall flaps (19) form outwardly extending triangular wings which fold downwardly against an increasing resistance until a certain downwardly inclined angle below the horizontal is reached when the end walls bow inwardly allowing the side walls to converge to relieve the resistance and create a force tending to bias the wings downwardly into engagement with the end walls to hold the wings against the end walls and the side wall flaps of the top closure in the closed condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to merchandise containers 
and is applicable to both pre-packed containers and to 
containers intended to receive goods at "point of 
sale". French Patent No. 2601332 discloses a container 
having side and end wall flaps integral with each 
other. The side wall flaps can be folded to form a top 
closure for the container and the end wall flaps form 
triangular wings which can be tucked into slits in the 
end walls of the container to retain the side wall 
flaps in the closure position. This invention provides a merchandise container 
formed from folded flexible sheet material to provide a 
box having side walls , end walls and a top closure, 
the top closure comprising flaps on the side walls 
which overlap to close the container and end wall flaps 
which are integral with the side wall flaps and form 
triangular wings on the end walls which can be folded 
downwardly to lie against the end walls, characterised 
in that the end walls of the container are formed with 
central crease lines extending lengthwise of the end 
walls from the upper edges of said flaps down the end 
walls to allow the end walls to bow inwardly into a concave 
formation so that, as the wings are folded downwardly 
past the horizontal towards the end walls, the end 
walls can bow inwardly allowing side walls to converge 
towards one another and thereby causing the wings to be 
biased downwardly against the inwardly bowed end walls 
of the container to hold the side wall flaps in closed, 
overlapping condition at the top of the container.  
 It is preferred that said central crease lines 
extend to the bottoms of the end walls. It is also preferred that said central crease 
lines are perforated at least through the top flaps of 
the end walls. More specifically the central crease 
lines may be perforated at least part-way down the end 
walls. In accordance with a further feature of the 
invention the end walls of the container may have 
further crease lines extending from the lower corners 
thereof upwardly and inwardly to meet said central 
crease lines at an apex. For example said further 
crease lines extend at 45o to the bottom edges of 
the end walls. The central crease lines may be perforated down 
to said apex with the further crease lines. 
Alternatively the central crease lines may be 
perforated down to a location above the apex with said 
further crease lines. In any of the above arrangements cut/score lines 
may be formed between the top flaps and end walls to 
weaken substantially the resistance

<CLAIMS>
A merchandise container formed from folded 
flexible sheet material to provide a box having side 

walls (10), end walls (11) and a top closure (13), the 
top closure (13) comprising flaps (17) on the side 

walls (10) which overlap to close the container and 
end wall flaps which are integral with the side wall 

flaps (17) and form triangular wings (19) on the end 
walls (11) which can be folded downwardly to lie 

against the end walls (11), characterised in that the 
end walls (11) of the container are formed with 

central crease lines (23) extending lengthwise of the 
end walls (11) from the upper edges of said flaps down 

the end walls (11) to allow the end walls (11) to bow 
inwardly into a concave formation so that, as the 

wings (19) are folded downwardly past the horizontal 
towards the end walls (11), the end walls can bow 

inwardly allowing side walls (10) to converge towards 
one another and thereby causing the wings (19) to be 

biased downwardly against the inwardly bowed end walls 
(11) of the container to hold the side wall flaps (17) 

in closed, overlapping condition at the top of the 
container. 
A container as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
said central crease lines (23) extend to the bottoms 

of the end walls (11). 
A container as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
the end walls (11) of the container have further 

crease lines (24) extending from the lower corners 
thereof upwardly and inwardly to meet said central 

crease lines (23) at an apex.  
 
A container as claimed in claim 3, wherein 
said central crease lines (23) are perforated down to  

 
said apex with said further crease lines (24). 
A container as claimed in claim 3, wherein 
said central crease lines (23) are perforated down to a 

location above the apex with the further crease lines 
(24). 
A container as claimed in any of claims 1 to 
5, wherein said central crease lines (23) are also 

perforated at least through the top flaps of the end 
walls (11). 
A container as claimed in any of claims 1 to 
6, wherein the central crease lines (23) are perforated 

at least part way down the end walls (11). 
A container as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
cut/score lines are formed between the top flaps and 

end walls (11) to weaken substantially the resistance 
to folding of the top flaps. 
A container as claimed in any of claims 1 to 
8, wherein the end wall flaps are each formed with a 

triangle of pre-creased fold lines to facilitate 
formation of said triangular shaped wing portions (19) 

when the side wall flaps (17) are folded together. 
A container as claimed in claim 9, wherein 
notches are cut at the corners between the upper of the 

overlapping side wall flaps (17) and end wall flap 
adjacent to it to facilitate sliding of said upper side 

wall flap (17) over the lower side wall flap for 
movement of the sides of the container towards each 

other as the end walls (11) of the container bow 
inwardly when the wing portions (19) are folded 

downwardly.  
 
A container as claimed in any of claims 1 to 
10, wherein the side wall flaps (17) have integral 

tongues which project above the edges of the adjacent 
end wall flaps prior to folding of the flaps the 

tongues overlapping one another when the side wall 
flaps are folded downwardly and inwardly to create the 

top closure (13) of the container. 
A container as claimed in any of the 
preceding claims, wherein the sheet material of the 

container is a stiff paper, card or plastic sheet.
