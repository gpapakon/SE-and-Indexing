<ABSTRACT>
Described are moulded bodies, in particular pellets, containing one or more plant extracts and made from a dispersion of one or more plant extracts in a matrix consisting mainly of a structure-forming agent, i.e. collagen, gelatin, fractionated gelatin, a collagen hydrolysate, a gelatin derivative, a plant protein or a plant-protein hydrolysate. Such pellets have a long storage life and their pharmacological and cosmetic properties are essentially the same as those of the natural extract. They are prepared by a simple method in which one or more liquid plant extracts are mixed or emulsified, or solid extracts dissolved or suspended, in a solution of the structure-forming agent, the dispersion of structure-forming agent and plant extract(s) is added dropwise to an inert low-temperature liquified gas, preferably liquid nitrogen, thus forming the pellets, and the pellets thus formed are dried. The preferred plant extract is Aloe vera juice.
