<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an unit 
including therein several controls of a motor 
vehicle, said unit being designed for replacing 
a conventional handle of a control lever of a 
motor vehicle. As is generally known in the motor vehicles 
provided with a direct transmission, the 
control lever for controlling the vehicle transmission 
is provided with a handle, or knob, 
which is affixed to the top portion of said control 
lever. During the running of the vehicle, a 
driver will engage with his/her left hand the 
vehicle steering wheel and, by his/her right 
hand the transmission control lever. Thus, if the driver desires to actuate for 
example his radio or compact disc player, or the 
windshield wiper, he is compelled to disengage 
the right hand from the steering wheel in order 
to perform such an operation. Moreover very frequently the driver drives 
his vehicle by holding his right hand on the 
handle of the control lever, even as the control 
lever must not be operated.  This means that, in addition to the steering 
wheel, the control lever is the preferred position 
in which a driver will put his right hand. For selecting a control to be operated, 
furthermore, the driver is usually compelled to 
divert his attention from the road in order to 
find the control to be actuated (for example the 
radio or windshield wiper control), which is 
rather dangerous from a safety standpoint. Accordingly, the main object of the present 
invention is to render more easy and quick 
the accesses by a driver to the several controls 
of a motor vehicle, without compelling the 
driver to divert his attention from the road in 
order to select the control to be actuated. Another object of the present invention is 
to provide such a control lever handle which is 
very comfortable. According to one aspect of the present invention 
the above mentioned objects, as well as 
yet other objects, which will become more apparent 
herein after, are achieved by a control 
lever handle comprising a handle element and a 
connecting element for connecting said handle  
 
element to a top portion of said control lever, 
characterized in that on said handle element 
there are arranged a plurality of controls of 
the motor vehicle and/or controls for controlling 
auxiliary means and/or signaling means of 
said motor vehicle. The above handle unit will allow the 
driver (if he does not already engage the control 
lever handle) to quickly displace his right 
hand to engage the handle, without diverting his 
attention from the
