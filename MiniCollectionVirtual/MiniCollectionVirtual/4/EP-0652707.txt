<ABSTRACT>
Microcrystalline chitosan is used in seed encrusting in the form of liquid dispersion containing 0.0001-10 wt % of polymer characterized by average molecular weight not lower than 1000, preferably 10 000-100 000, water retention value ranging from 200 to 5000 % deacetylation degree not lower than 35 %, particle size in the range of 0.1-100 (my)m and energy of hydrogen bonds in a form of film of 10-25 kJ/mol, preferably 10-20 kJ/mol. Said liquid dispersion is introduced by spraying or mixing for 1-30 minutes with a content of polymer not lower than 0.01 wt %, whereafter the excess of solvent is removed and polymer film covering the seed is formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for seed encrusting using chitosan.One of the most important parameters that affect the
quantity of crops is the optimal amount of plants on a
given sown area unit and keeping this amount unchanged
until harvest time. This results above all from the
quality of the sowable material and the protection of
this material from diseases and pests. The most profitable
and effective method to protect the plant against
diseases and pests is the seed dressing or coating
applied before sowing. The dressed sowable material
ensures the high percentage of germinated plants, the
plants grow quickly and are healthy and uniform, which
results in more effective crops. The efficiency of the
seed dressing depends on the properly choosed chemicals
for seed dressing, the dosage of seed dressing chemicals
and the method of applications.There are well-known dry, semi-dry and wet seed dressing,
coating and encrusting methods. The well-known
method of encrusting seeds consists of mixing of the
seed dressing chemicals formulated with a liquid or
solid products for encrusting and subsequent coating on
the seed. A coating is obtained where, after drying, the
dressing chemicals bind with the seed. The seed is
coated with the dressing chemicals in a uniform and firm
way, dosage is precise and dosage of the dressing
chemicals is optimized. Also dusting during dressing,
packing, transporting and sowing is avoided which
increases the work safety. The encrusting preparations
should be characterized by high adhesion and should form
up a solid film on the seed surface that is water-permeable
or swells in water as well as is capable of
biodegrading. At the same time the use of an encrusting 
agent should reduce the dosage of dressing chemicals as
well as their losses into the environment.There is known a way of seed treatment described in the
PL-A-124871 that consists of coating of the
seed with a water-insoluble and moisture-permeable film
containing the encrusting preparations as well as the
plant pesticides. The encrusting agent is composed of
3.5 - 22.5 % w/v of synthetic resins and 67-87 % w/v of
organic solvents such as alcohol or acetone.There is also known a process for the preparation of
coated seed described in US-A-4344979 that
consists of coating of the seed with a coating agent
containing hydrophilic synthetic polymers having hydroxyl,
carboxyl, ester or carbamyl groups with combination
with a peroxide compound such as calcium peroxide or
magnesium peroxide.object of the WO 85/01736 is a

the microcrystalline chitosan dispersion contains inorganic

and/or organic volatile solvents, such as water and/or
alcohols or ketones, such as ethyl alcohol or acetone, as the

liquid.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the microcrystalline chitosan dispersion contains 0.001-0.1
