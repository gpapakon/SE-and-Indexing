<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel compounds which inhibit 
microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, and to pharmaceutical compositions 
decreasing serum lipids and treating atherosclerosis comprising 
such compounds. The microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) 
catalyzes the transport of triglyceride (TG), cholesteryl ester (CE), 
and phosphatidylcholine (PC) between small unilamellar vesicles 
(SUV). Wetterau & Zilversmit, Chem. Phys. Lipids38, 205-22 
(1985). When transfer rates are expressed as the percent of the 
donor lipid transferred per time, MTP expresses a distinct 
preference for neutral lipid transport (TG and CE), relative to 
phospholipid transport. The protein from bovine liver has been 
isolated and characterized. Wetterau & Zilversmit, Chem. Phys. 
Lipids38, 205-22 (1985). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
(PAGE) analysis of the purified protein suggests that the transfer 
protein is a complex of two subunits of apparent molecular weights 
58,000 and 88,000, since a single band was present when purified 
MTP was electrophoresed under nondenaturing condition, while  
 
two bands of apparent molecular weights 58,000 and 88,000 were 
identified when electrophoresis was performed in the presence of 
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). These two polypeptides are 
hereinafter referred to as 58 kDa and 88 kDa, respectively, or the 
58 kDa and the 88 kDa component of MTP, respectively, or the low 
molecular weight subunit and the high molecular weight subunit of 
MTP, respectively. Characterization of the 58,000 molecular weight 
component of bovine MTP indicates that it is the previously 
characterized multifunctional protein, protein disulfide isomerase 
(PDI). Wetterau et al., J. Biol. Chem.265, 9800-7 (1990). The 
presence of PDI in the transfer protein is supported by evidence 
showing that (1) the amino terminal 25 amino acids of the bovine 
58,000 kDa component of MTP is identical to that of bovine PDI, 
and (2) disulfide isomerase activity was expressed by bovine MTP 
following the dissociation of the 58 kDa - 88 kDa protein complex. 
In addition, antibodies raised against bovine PDI, a protein which by 
itself has no TG transfer activity, were able to immunoprecipitate 
bovine TG transfer activity from a solution containing purified 
bovine MTP. PDI normally plays a role in the folding and assembly of 
newly synthesized disulfide bonded proteins within the lumen of the 
endoplasmic reticulum. Bulleid & Freedman, Nature335, 649-51 
(1988). It catalyzes the proper pairing of cysteine
