<ABSTRACT>
The invention refers to a closed operative plant consists of a cylindrical 
rotary kiln (6-7) with upper filtering unit (34) for the smokes to 

be used for producing bituminous conglomerate. Said cylindrical kiln 
with initial part of smaller diameter (6), forming the drying chamber 

(16), and subsequent part of larger diameter (7), forming the combustion 
chamber (17), foresees in its inner a cylindrical structure (21) with 

fixed duct, brought on header (22), which lets in the heat flow from 
the burner (32) to the combustion chamber (17) countercurrent compared 

to the direction of advancement of the inert product. Inside the cylindrical 
kiln is then foreseen a mixing chamber (23) formed by a closed 

unit lying behind the wall where is placed the inlet of the heat flow. 
Moreover it is foreseen the unloading of the product ready to be used 
from the mixing chamber (23) by means of three hydraulic cylinder (28) 

which open a set of equidistant portholes (29). The filtering unit 
consists of a closed cycle realizing the blasting of the smokes purified 

by means of fabric filters (37). The purifies air is then unloaded 
outdoor passing through a stack 40 using an intake manifolt (38) with 

air propeller (39). Moreover it is foreseen the coming into che mixing 
chamber (23) of the recovery fine dust of cement together with nonasphaltic 

road oil at 140°, coming from a feeder by means of a duct (25), 
and with other material made by fine dust of cement acting as binder 

coming from a screw conveyor (26) coaxially placed around the duct 
(25).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a plant consists of a cylindrical rotary furnace 
and of a filter for the smokes to be used for producing bituminous 
conglomerate in continuous cycle. Said cylindrical furnace consists of 
an initial part of smaller diameter, forming the drying chamber, and 
of an other part of larger diameter and it provides in its inner a 
cylindrical structure with fixed duct, brought on head, which lets 
in the heat flow from the burner to the combustion chamber countercurrent 
compared to the way of advancement of the inert product. Inside the 
cylindrical furnace a mixing chamber is then provided. It consists 
of a closed unit lying behind the wall where is placed the inlet of 
the heat flow. Moreover the unloading of the product ready to be used 
from the mixing chamber of the furnace to a programmed time is provided. 
The filter realizes the blasting of the smokes with continuous unloading 
towards outside of the purified air. Said filter makes the total recovery 
and dosing of the fine dust of the cement suspended in the air flow 
for its prompt use into the mixing chamber. Moreover the filter permits 
the complete use of the heat flow acting into a closed cycle. According 
to the prior art is know the plant described and shown in the Italian 
Patent Application BO91A 000487. In comparison with said plant the 
invented plant providing the heat flow countercurrent compared to the 
direction of advancement of the inert product into the drying and  
 
and combustion chmbers permits, for contact, to increase the heat exchan 
ge effect so assuring a better yield of the furnace. Being the combustion 
chamber provides in a closed unit, thanks to the different placing 
of the unit generating the heat flow, it is avoided the product volatization 
in particular of the fine dust of the cement and it is permitted 
to keep the product mixing to a right dosing. The invented cylindrical 
furnace with its inital part of smaller diameter, contrary to the 
furnace described in the italian document BO91A 000487 with an unchanged 
diameter, permits to actuate the widths of the drying and combustion 
chambers related to the use necessities; this considering that into 
the drying chamber is prevalent necessary to move the product onto 
the wall to increase the licking up effect while into the combustion 
chamber is prevalent the necessity to bring the product onto the heat 
source. In the plant described in the Italian document BO91A 000487 
the unloading of the product ready to be used from the mixing

Plant for producing bituminous conglomerate in continuous work 
cycle, comprising a closed operative plant supported on a frame 

with three aligned bridges (1) completed with a bearing network 
structure (2) with beams (3), slanting towards the unloading side, 

which structure supports, on couple with rotary bearings (4) with 
rollers (5), a cylindrical rotary furnace (6-7), into which inert 

product coming from an elevator (13) is fed, and above the cylindrical 
furnace, always supported by the network structure (2), a parallelepipedal 

filtering unit (34); 

the cylindrical furnace (6-7) consisting of an initial part of 
smaller diameter (6) forming a drying chamber (16) and of a subsequent 

part of larger diameter (7) forming a combustion chamber (17); 
in said drying chamber (16) the product, moved by sets of vanes, 

proceeds due to gravity effect to come into the combustion chamber 
(17), at the end of which the product climbs on a rotary elevator 

equipped with a set of vanes (18) and is unloaded in continuous 
work cycle by means of a chute (24) into a mixing chamber (23), 

where nonasphaltic road oil at 140° is let in through a duct (25) and 
where other material made of fine dust of cement is let in through 

a screw conveyor (26), and from which the product ready to be used 
is unloaded by means of a hopper (31); 
the cylindrical furnace (6-7) using a burner (32), which, through 
a duct provided in a cylindrical structure (21), lets in a flame 

through a mouth (33), thereby creating a heat flow countercurrent 
compared to the material advancing into the drying chamber (16) 

and into the combustion chamber (17); 
to better mixthe product its intermittent unloading being actuated 
by three hydraulic cylinders (28) equipped with timers for regulating
