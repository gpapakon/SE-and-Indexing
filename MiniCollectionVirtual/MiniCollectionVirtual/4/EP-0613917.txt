<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of a nylon block 
copolymer involves introducing two or more reaction streams 

consisting of molten lactam and having a temperature of 68-95°C 
into a mold having a temperature of 100-180°C, wherein 

the reaction streams contain one or more polyols and/or 
polyamines, lactam blocked polyisocyanates and a catalyst, 

the catalyst and the polyisocyanate are in different streams 
and the catalyst-containing reaction stream contains, besides 

sodium lactamate or potassium lactamate, a Lewis acid. A 
faster reaction rate during the RIM process is obtained as a 

result of the presence of a Lewis acid in addition to sodium 
lactamate or potassium lactamate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for preparing a 
nylon block copolymer in which two or more reaction streams 
containing molten lactam and having a temperature of 68-95°C 
are introduced into a mold having a temperature of 100-180°C. 
When combined, the reaction streams contain one or more 
polyols, lactam blocked polyisocyanates and catalyst, with the 
proviso that the catalyst and the lactam blocked polyisocyanate 
are in different reaction streams before being introduced into 
the mold. In a process described in NL-A-8702950, a prepolymer 
consisting of the reaction product of a polyol with a lactam 
blocked polyisocyanate is prepared immediately after mixing the 
reaction streams and a nylon block copolymer is thereafter 
formed. If the catalyst is sodium or potassium lactamate, the 
formation of the prepolymer proceeds slowly whereas the 
formation of nylon proceeds rapidly. This results in an 
inhomogeneous product having with moderate impact resistance. 
When a Grignard compound (Lewis acid) is the catalyst, the 
formation of prepolymer proceeds rapidly whereas the formation 
of nylon proceeds slowly. This causes the reaction time to be 
too long for, for instance, a RIM process (RIM = Reaction 
Injection Molding). Other low or only moderate impact resistant products 
are described in G.B. 1,067,153 and G.B. 1,099,265. The art has long sought a facile process which 
proceeds rapidly to a homogeneous nylon block copolymer having 
good homogeneity and improved impact resistance.  The present invention comprises a facile, and 
reproducible process for rapidly preparing nylon block 
copolymers which have good homogeneity and improved impact 
resistance. In the present process the reaction proceeds 
rapidly under mild temperature and pressure conditions. To this end, two or more reaction streams, each 
having a temperature of 68-95°C, preferably 75-90°C, are 
combined in a mold having a temperature of 100-180°C. One of 
the reaction streams contains, in addition to a sodium 
lactamate or potassium lactamate catalyst, a Lewis acid. A 
prepolymer is formed at about 68-95°C by the reaction between 
at least one polyol and/or at least one polyamine and lactam-blocked 
polyisocyanate under the influence of the Lewis acid. 
The nylon block copolymer is thereafter formed at a temperature 
of 100-180°C with the aid of an alkali metal lactamate, such as 
sodium lactamate or potassium lactamate, as a catalyst in the 
presence of a Lewis acid. A nylon block copolymer with 
excellent impact resistance is
