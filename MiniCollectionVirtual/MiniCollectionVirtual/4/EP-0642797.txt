<ABSTRACT>
The present invention includes a formulation which 
comprises an antibacterial substance and an antiulcer substance, 

wherein at least either of them is formulated into a 
gastrointestinal mucosa-adherent solid preparation. 
 
The formulation of the present invention shows long 
retention time in the gastrointestinal tract because of adhesion 

to the gastrointestinal tract mucosa, synergetically enhances 
the pharmaceutical effects of an antibacterial substance, 

especially an antibiotic against 
Helicobacter pylori
 (HP) and an 
antiulcer substance, with very low doses of active ingredients, 

particularly the anti-HP antibiotic with low prevalence of side 
effects. The present agent is useful as an antiulcer agent, 

showing potent anti-HP activity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a formulation which comprises an
antibacterial substance and an antiulcer substance, wherein at least either of
them is formulated into a gastrointestinal mucosa-adherent solid
preparation. The formulation of the present invention is used as an antiulcer
agent and for other purposes.Since the isolation of Helicobacterpylori (hereinafter also referred to as
HP) in 1983 [Lancet, 1,1273 (1983)], its association with gastritis and
digestive ulcer has drawn attention. This is because HP is found at high
positivity rates in chronic gastritis or gastric ulcer [American Journal of
Gastroenterology, 82, 2283(1987)], despite the fact that it is normally not
found in the mucosa of healthy humans [APMIS, 96, 84 (1988)].On the other hand, the development of H2 blockers and proton pump
inhibitors (hereinafter also referred to as PPI) has resulted in markedly
improved healing rates for gastric/duodenal ulcer. However, there are some
contractile cases in which no improvement occurs despite the appropriate
treatment using these drugs, posing major problems. According to a report of
such cases of contractile gastric ulcer [Japanese Journal of Gastroenterology,
89, 571 (1992)], the HP positivity rate is extremely high, with a reduction in
the amount of gastromucosal mucus attributable to the ammonia produced by
HP. Also, there are some reports of sustained infection with HP which delays
ulcer healing or which is involved in ulcer recurrence [Lancet, 335, 1233
(1990); New England Journal of Medicine, 328, 308 (1993)]. Judging from
these many clinical findings, HP elimination is believed to be useful in early
healing of ulcer or prevention of its recurrence.For the reasons described above, various anti-HP drugs have been
administered to patients with gastric/duodenal ulcer. Although some PPIs
possessing anti-HP activity have been developed, they remain unsatisfactory
as to healing effect when used alone because their antibacterial action
against HP is not always sufficient. Also, concomitant therapy has been
performed with fair therapeutic results in which antiulcer agents such as H2 
blockers and PPI are used in combination with antibacterial substances
[Medical Journal of Australia, 151, 431 (1988); George LL et al., Medical
Journal of Australia. 153, 145 (1990); Peterson WL et al., New England
Journal of Medicine, 324, 1043 (1991); New England Journal of Medicine,
328, 308 (1993)].Antibacterial substances such as amoxicillin (hereinafter also referred
to as AMOX), metronidazole
