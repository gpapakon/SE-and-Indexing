<ABSTRACT>
Electronic components (18) such as chips are attracted to the tip ends of 
nozzles (15a - 15b) under suction, and mounted on printed-circuit boards (29) 

when the vacuum condition in the nozzles is broken. The time for breaking the 
vacuum condition in the nozzles (15a - 15b) is adjusted by a variable time 

adjusting unit (44) based on angular displacement information of a cam (25) which 
vertically moves the nozzles (15a - 15b) depending on the selected mounting 

cycle. Even when a different mounting cycle is selected, time delays are varied to 
adjust the time for breaking the vacuum condition in the nozzles (15a - 15b) for 

thereby mounting electronic components (18) accurately and stably on printed-circuit 
boards (29).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic packaging apparatus or 
mounter for mounting electronic components such as chips or the like on 
component support mediums such as printed-circuit boards, and more particularly 
to an electronic packaging apparatus for moving nozzles which attract electronic 
components under suction with accurate timing when or after the electronic 
components are mounted on component support mediums. There have heretofore been proposed various electronic packaging 
apparatus or mounters for mounting electronic components such as chips or the 
like on printed-circuit boards. FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings schematically 
shows a conventional packaging machine for drawing a carrier tape with a 
plurality of chips bonded thereto at longitudinal intervals therealong from a 
cassette, and mounting chips on a printed-circuit board or the like through an 
attracting head on a turntable. More specifically, as shown in FIG. 1, a component supply unit 1 
movable in the directions indicated by the arrows A, A' carries a plurality of 
cassettes 2 each housing a roll of carrier tape with a plurality of chips bonded 
thereto at longitudinal intervals therealong. The component supply unit 1 is moved 
to bring the tape outlet port of one of the cassettes 2 to an attracting position or a 
first station P1 on a turntable 3 which is positioned in front of the component 
supply unit 1. The turntable 3 can be indexed successively to twelve positions, i.e., first 
through twelve stations P1 - P12, which are spaced at equal angular intervals for 
effecting respective operations. In the first station P1, an electronic component such as a chip is attracted 
from a carrier tape under vacuum by an attracting head 4. Then, the turntable 3 is 
angularly moved an angle  of 30° to bring the electronic component to the second 
station P2 in which the electronic component is centered. In the next third station 
P3, the vertical position of the electronic component is measured by a laterally 
positioned imaging camera or a phototransistor. In the fourth station P4, an imaging camera or the like positioned below 
the turntable 3 detects whether there is an electronic component or not and also 
recognizes the shape of the electronic component. No operation is effected on the  
 
electronic component in the fifth station P5. In the sixth station P6, if the electronic 
component is angularly displaced with respect to the attracting head 4 as detected 
by the shape recognition, then the electronic

A packaging apparatus for mounting a component (18) on a component 
support medium (29), comprising: 


component mounting means (15a-15e) for holding and placing a 
component (18) on a component support medium (29) in a predetermined 

mounting cycle 
said predetermined mounting cycle depending on 

the size and the type of the component; and 
a camshaft (24) whose angular position controls the movement of the 
component mounting means (15a - 15e); 
 
   characterised in that there is further provided: 


positional information detecting means (32, 33) for detecting the angular

pneumatic pressure circuit starts switching from a vacuum condition to an air 
discharge condition. 
A packaging apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said 
component mounting means (15a - 15e) comprises an attracting head (8) including 

a pneumatic pressure circuit, said time at which said component mounting means 
(15a - 15e) starts holding the component (18) being a time at which said 

pneumatic pressure circuit starts switching from an air discharge condition to a
