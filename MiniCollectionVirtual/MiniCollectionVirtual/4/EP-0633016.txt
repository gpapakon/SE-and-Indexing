<ABSTRACT>
Cosmetics comprising a fluorine compound-treated powder, and a 
liquid perfluoro organic compound are disclosed. These 

cosmetics are excellent in water repellency, water resistance, 
sebum resistance and oil resistance, prevent cosmetic 

components from the removal due to sweat or sebum, show a good 

spreadability on the skin and give a desirable feel at the use, 
for example, a moist and refreshing feel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cosmetic. More
particularly, it relates to a cosmetic which is excellent in
water repellency and water resistance, further has an oil
resistance, prevents cosmetic components such as pigments
from the removal due to sweat or sebum and thus gives long-lasting
makeup effect.Many water and oil repellent powders obtained by
treating powders with a fluorine compound have been known as
disclosed, for example, in JP-A-55-167209 (the term "JP-A" as
used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese Patent
Application"), JP-A-62-250074, JP-A-1-180811 and U.S. Patent
3,632,744.On the other hand, there has been required cosmetics,
in particular, makeup cosmetics, which are excellent in, for
example, water repellency and long-lasting makeup effect.
When it is attempted to blend an oil commonly employed in
these cosmetic products with a powder surface-treated with a
fluorine compound in order to improve water repellency,
however, the powder cannot be uniformly dispersed in the oil
and thus any cosmetic having a good water repellency can be
hardly obtained.Accordingly, there has been required to develop a
cosmetic, wherein a powder is uniformly dispersed, having a 
good water repellency, a good water resistance and a good
long-lasting makeup effect.On the other hand, powders have been added to
cosmetics in order to color the skin or hair, to cover spots
and freckles and to protect the skin from, for example, UV
rays. In particular, an emulsified cosmetic, which shows a
good feel and multi-functions, is blended with a powder to
thereby give various cosmetic products including emulsified
foundations, UV-protective emulsions and creams.Recently, hydrophobic powders and hydrophobic-treated
powders have been used in order to improve the adhesiveness
to the skin and to impart water (sweat) resistance. When
such a hydrophobic powder is to be stably blended with an
emulsified cosmetic, however, it is required to thicken an
oily phase used as a dispersion medium or to increase the
amount of an emulsifier or a dispersant. Thus it is very
difficult to obtain a product which shows a good feel and
sustains powders in a stable state.Further, in recent years, it has been attempted to
use liquid perfluoro organic compounds in order to impart
sebum and oil resistance to cosmetics, to make the skin or
hair moist and smooth and to protect the skin and hair, as
disclosed, for example, in JP-A-61-234928 and JP-A-63-107911.
However, these perfluoro organic compounds are incompatible
with other components
