<ABSTRACT>
A cylinder (1) containing a piston rod to which a nozzle (8) is 
attached, is fixed to the 

outside of a tank. A pressurized fluid is sprayed into the tank from 
the nozzle, and 

the piston rod elongates and contracts with the pressure of this fluid. 
Further 

provided are a first supply passage (23) connecting a first pressure 
chamber formed around 

the piston rod in the cylinder to a pump (2), a return passage (29) 
connecting a second 

pressure chamber on the opposite side of the piston rod to the tank, 
and a second 

supply passage (25) connecting the second pressure chamber to the pump. 
A first valve (26) is 

provided in the return passage (29), and a second valve (24) is provided 
in the second supply 

passage (25). In addition, there are provided a mechanism for detecting 
the contracted and 

an elongated position of the piston rod, a mechanism for closing the 
first valve (26) and 

opening the second valve (24) when the contracted position is detected, 
and a mechanism 

for opening the first valve and closing the second valve when the 
elongated position is 

detected, and the piston rod is made to automatically execute 
contraction/elongation 

cycles. Still further provided is a mechanism for stopping the 
operation of the pump 

when the number of these cycles has reached a predetermined value. In 
this manner, 

fluid is sprayed in the tank to clean its interior while the nozzle 
automatically moves 

back and forth in the tank, and the spray automatically stops when a 
preset number of back and forth movements have been executed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control of a tank cleaning device 
wherein a nozzle sprays pressurised fluid inside a tank by 
means of fluid pressure, and especially to a tank cleaning 
device comprising a cylinder fixed to an outside of a tank, a 
piston housed inside said cylinder such that it is free to 
slide axially in said cylinder, a piston rod fixed to said 
piston and having an end projecting inside said tank, said 
piston rod elongating and contracting outside said cylinder 
between a limiting elongated position and a limiting contracted 
position according to the slide of said piston, means for 
detecting a contracted position of said piston rod, means for 
detecting an elongated position of said piston rod, a first 
pressure chamber formed by said piston around said piston rod 
inside said cylinder, a second pressure chamber formed by said 
piston on the opposite side of said piston rod inside said 
cylinder, a nozzle attached to the projecting end of said 
piston rod, pump means for providing a pressurised fluid, a 
first supply passage connecting said first pressure chamber to 
said pump means, a return passage connecting said second 
pressure chamber to a drain, a first shutoff valve provided in 
said return passage, a second supply passage connecting said 
second pressure chamber to said pump means, a second shutoff 
valve provided in said second supply passage, and a passage 
formed inside said piston rod for the purpose of guiding said 
pressurised fluid from said first pressure chamber to said 
nozzle.  
 In devices that clean the interior of tanks in chemical plants, food tanks and 
fermentation tanks, a nozzle is for example disposed inside the tank, and made to 
rotate so as to spray cleaning fluid inside the tank. A device wherein a pair of nozzles are made to rotate about a horizontal axis, and 
the holder supporting the nozzles is made to rotate about a vertical axis so as to 
spray cleaning fluid uniformly in up, down, left and right directions, is disclosed in 
Tokko Sho 62-60146 (JP-B-6260146) published by the Japanese Patent Office. However, if the tank is longer in the upward/downward direction as in the case of 
a cylindrical tank, for example, the tank cannot be cleaned uniformly if the nozzle is 
fixed even if the spray is made uniform in all directions. In such a tank, uniform 
cleaning can be performed if the nozzle holder is moved up and down while spraying 
takes place, but this requires the use of a raising and lowering mechanism comprising 
a motor and gears for
