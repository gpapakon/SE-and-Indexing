<ABSTRACT>
A cathodic electrodeposition paint containing a 
cationically modified epoxy resin and a crosslinker 

dispersed in an acidic aqueous medium is disclosed. The 
paint contains an auxiliary resin component capable of 

improving the surface smoothness of the cured paint films. 
The auxiliary resin is a reaction product produced by 

reacting a t-alkylphenol novolac epoxy resin with an active 
hydrogen compound to open all epoxy rings. When the 

auxiliary resin has a hydroxyl group introduced by the 
reaction with the active hydrogen compound, a lactone or 

alkylene oxide is addition reacted with the hydroxyl group 
for grafting a soft segment to the auxiliary resin. By 

grafting a soft segment, the auxiliary resin improves not 
only the surface smoothness but also the impact strength of 

the paint films.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cathodic electrodeposition 
paint forming films having improved surface smoothness. It 
also related to a cathodic electrodeposition paint forming 
films having improved surface smoothness and improved impact 
strength. Amine-modified epoxy resins used as a film-forming 
cationic resin in cationic electrodeposition paints are 
known in the art, for example, in JP-A-54004978 and JP-A-56034186. 
These amine-modified epoxy resins are produced by 
reacting a bisphenol type epoxy resin with a primary or 
secondary amine to open all epoxy rings with the amine, or 
by reacting the epoxy resin first with a hydroxyl or 
carboxyl group-containing compound such as monophenols, 
monocarboxylic acids, hydroxycarboxylic acids, 
polycaprolactone diols or polyether diols to open a portion 
of epoxy rings and then with a primary or secondary amine to 
open the remaining epoxy rings. The resultant amine-modified 
epoxy resins are dispersed in an aqueous medium 
containing a neutralizing acid together with a crosslinker 
such as blocked polyisocyanates or melamine resin. Self-crosslinkable, 
amine-modified epoxy resins may be produced  
 
by reacting a bisphenol type epoxy resin with a half blocked 
diisocyanate to bind the diisocyanate through a secondary 
alcoholic group present in the resin molecule and then with 
a primary or secondary amine to open all terminal epoxy 
rings. Cathodic electrodeposition paints derived from the 
above amine-modified epoxy resins have a defect that their 
wet films are susceptible to tiny craters induced by oil 
droplets or other particulate matters during the baking step 
resulting in cured films with impaired surface smoothness. 
Several methods are known to solve this problem including 
the addition of silicone anti-repellents or adducts of epoxy 
resin and polyoxypropylene diamine to the paint 
formulation. These additives, however, tend to decrease the 
adhesion of the paint film to a middle or top coating layer 
directly applied thereon. A need exists for a cathodic electrodeposition paint 
which may produce a cured film having improved surface 
smoothness without imparing other film properties including 
adhesion to an overcoating layer. The present invention provides a cathodic 
electrodeposition paint which may produce a cured film 
having improved surface smoothness. The paint comprises a 
primary cationic film-forming resin and an auxiliary film-forming  
 
resin capable of improving the surface smoothness of 
the cured films, and a crosslinker, all
