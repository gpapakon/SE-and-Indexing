 COLON CRYPT CELL MITOGEN, CELL LINE PRODUCING IT, AND USES THEREOFRELATED APPLICATIONThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Serial No. 851,732, filed March 16, 1992.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a factor useful as a stimulator of cells, such as intestinal cells and colonic crypt cells. More particularly, it relates to a membrane associated factor identified as a mitogen, which is produced by a colonic cell line, and conditioned medium containing it.BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ARTMany cell products have been identified via analysis of their effect on targeted cell populations and subpopulations. Such products include a plethora of materials including growth factors, cytokines, and so forth. These substances are extremely powerful and are produced in vanishingly small amounts by normal cells.One of the major goals of contemporary molecular biology is the identification and cloning of genes which produce the various materials generally discussed supra. While such genes have been identified for materials such as erythropoietin (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,703,008), and interleukin-7 (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,965,195), the relevant genetic material is not always available, or is not available as quickly as the art would like. In such cases, an important means of securing sufficient amounts of the material of interest is via the identification and isolation of cell lines which produce the desired product.Examples of proteinaceous cell products which were first identified via cell lines which produced them are "granulocyte colony stimulating factor" or "G-CSF" (see 

U.S. Patent No. 4,833,127), and interleukin-3 (see U.S. Patent No. 4,658,018). The latter patent is of particular interest because, while the factor could not be completely characterized in terms of parameters such as molecular weight, isoelectric point, etc. , its functional properties were clearly defined. .Another example of this approach to factors of biological pertinence and their isolation from cell lines may be seen in Golde et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,438,032. Of course, the artisan is also aware of the vast number of known monoclonal antibodies which are produced by hybridoma cell lines. Frequently, the most pertinent feature of these proteins is their specificity, and this is all that is required to identify them.Although many factors involved in the formulation of cell growth have been identified, the diversity of different cell types is evidence of the need to continue work toward

2. The conditioned medium of claim 1, wherein said colonic crypt cell stimulating mitogen producing cell is a cell from cell line LIM 2537.
3. The conditioned medium of claim 1, wherein said mitogen is produced by cell line LIM 2537.
4. The conditioned medium of claim 1, wherein said agent comprises at least one member selected from the group consisting of RPMI 1640 and fetal calf serum.
5. Cell line LIM 2537.
6. Method for stimulating colonic crypt cell proliferation comprising contacting a sample containing said colonic crypt cell with the conditioned medium of claim 1 in an amount sufficient to stimulate proliferation of said cell.
7. Method for stimulating colonic crypt cell proliferation comprising contacting a sample containing said colonic crypt cell with the cell line of claim 5 and a medium into which said cell line secretes a colonic crypt cell stimulating mitogen, and culturing said sample under conditions favoring production of said mitogen and proliferation of said colonic crypt cell.
