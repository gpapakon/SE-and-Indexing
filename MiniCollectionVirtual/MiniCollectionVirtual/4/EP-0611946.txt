<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of measuring 
minute step heights on an object and an apparatus with 
a confocal laser scanning differential interference 
contrast microscope therefor. Generally, there have been utilized scan-type 
electron microscopes or probe-type microscopes in order 
to quantifiably measure minute step heights formed on 
an object in nanometer order. Also, atomic force 
microscopes (AFM) have been started to be utilized 
recently. However, the scan-type electron microscopes and 
atomic force microscopes are expensive and the handling 
of those is difficult. In the probe-type microscopes, 
a probe is brought into contact with the surface of the 
object for the measurement, so the object is liable to 
be damaged and the probe is often broken, necessitating 
replacement of the probe often. Consequently, it is 
also disadvantageous from the viewpoint of the cost. Therefore, the inventors of the present invention 
utilized a phase contrast microscope and a differential 
interference contrast microscope and tried to obtain  
 
the amount of step heights from image outputs of these 
microscopes quantifiably. This method is not 
impossible in principle but it is very difficult to 
establish a formula for the method from the wave 
optical image formation theory. Also, the principle 
for measuring step heights by utilizing the 
differential interference contrast microscope is 
disclosed at page 70 in O plus E (a Japanese 
publication) published in October, 1992, wherein a 
signal corresponding to the slope of the step 
structure is obtained when the width (not height) of 
the step structure on the object (phase object) is 
sufficiently larger than a light spot. That is, the 
method is applicable to the object having the step 
heights with gentle slopes, in which the measurement 
of the step heights can be performed without taking 
the effect of diffraction into consideration. Also, 
the effect of diffraction of the optical system is not 
taken into consideration. Accordingly, the resolution 
to an object having minute and narrow step heights is 
considerably reduced. Optic Communications, 85 (1991), P177 discloses 
a double mode channel waveguide in an interference contrast microscope. It would be desirable to provide a method and an 
apparatus capable of measuring on an object step 
heights having a narrower width than a light spot with 
high resolution, without being in contact with the 
object. The present invention is set out in the appended 
claims.
