<ABSTRACT>
A xenon arc lamp (10, 12) used as a high intensity light source for a liquid crystal light valve projector includes a cold mirror (16) that reflects visible reading light (18a, 18b) to the liquid crystal light valve and transmits infrared light to a heat transfer unit (20) that is arranged to remove heat from the projector. The heat transfer unit (20), positioned adjacent the back of the cold mirror, is formed by a group of wire grids (50, 52, 54, 56) that are mutually parallel and spaced close to one another with the openings of the grids displaced so as to be out of alignment with one another from grid to grid. The grids are mounted in a housing (28, 30, 34) which includes a heat reflective backup plate (62) on the far side of the grids and a cooling gas is caused to flow through the housing and over the grids to remove the heat transferred to the grid from the infrared radiation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to heat transfer and
more particularly concerns methods and apparatus for
rapidly and efficiently removing heat from a heat source.Various types of optical image projection systems,
such as liquid crystal video projectors, for example,
require a light source of very high intensity in order to
project a relatively small image of an image source, such
as a cathode ray tube, for example, at a distance upon a
larger screen with sufficient illumination intensity for
viewing in ambient light. The requisite high intensity of
light is commonly provided by an arc lamp, such as a xenon
arc lamp, which generates a very high intensity of light
not only in the visible region, but also in the infrared
region. The video projection system, of course, being a
light viewing device, can usefully employ light energy only
in visible wavelengths, between about 400 and 700
nanometers, for example. However, light energy in near
infrared wavelengths, roughly between about 780 to 2500
nanometers, not only is not useful since it is not
perceptible to the human eye, but tends to heat the various
parts of a projector to such a degree as to significantly
degrade or even destroy operability. The commonly used
xenon arc lamp provides a significant amount of energy in
the near infrared spectrum. Therefore, to avoid
degradation or destruction of sensitive parts, including
the liquid crystal light valve itself for example, the heat
of this arc lamp must be dissipated.US-A-3152764 discloses a quartz tube floodlight where
the rear portions of the reflector and mounting legs of the
reflector are provided with cooling fins. Heat dissipation presently employed in systems of
this nature generally are heat sinks that are formed of
solid blocks or of solid blocks with an arrangement of heat
dissipating fins formed of thermally conductive material.
However, the speed and efficiency at which such heat sinks
absorb and dissipate heat is poor. A number of problems
result from the use of heat dissipating heat sinks in
optical systems. The heat sink itself is subject to
melting when it is unable to dissipate heat at a rate
sufficient to handle all of the incident energy.A dichroic mirror, often termed a "cold" mirror, is
frequently employed to filter out infrared energy by
reflecting visible light to the projection system and
passing infrared light to the heat sink. Such an
apparatus forms the basis of the precharacterising
portions of appended claims 1 and 11. However, the heat
energy passed through the mirror can result
