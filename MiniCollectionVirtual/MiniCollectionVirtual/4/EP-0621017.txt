<ABSTRACT>
An intravascular stent comprising a cylindrical sheet 
having overlapping edges that interlock. The edges have a 

series of protrusions and apertures (33) that interlock and ratchet 
as the stent expands to an open position to support a section 

of arterial wall. The stent may be expanded by a balloon 
catheter or it may be self-expanding. The stent is 

biocompatible, may be bio-erodible, and capable of localized 
drug delivery. 
A plurality of retaining members to keep the stent 
open are disclosed. In one embodiment a buckle (20) fastening 

member is used, while in another embodiment a helical seam 
containing projections (25) is employed. The stent may be wound in 

such a manner that during expansion of the stent, one side of 
the sheet comprising the stent desires to return to its 

original shape, creating a bias. In addition, a variety of 
reticulated structure stents are disclosed, with novel 

geometric patterns that aid in increased flexibility while 
preserving radial strength and which also allow blood-tissue 

interaction and side branch access. 
The intravascular stent may be made of a sheet of 
material strengthened and stiffened by pyrolytic carbon or by 

structural reinforcement as in composite laminates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to expandable 
endoprosthesis devices, in particular to expandable 
intraluminal vascular grafts, generally called stents, 
adapted to be implanted into a body lumen, such as a 
coronary artery, to maintain the patency of the lumen. 
These devices frequently are used in the treatment of 
atherosclerotic stenosis in blood vessels, especially after 
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) 
procedures, with the intent of helping to reduce the 
likelihood of restenosis of a blood vessel. Stents also 
are used to support a body lumen where a flap or 
dissection has occurred or, in general, where the lumen is 
weak. The present invention also relates to an expandable 
intraluminal vascular graft that can be used in any body 
lumen. In expandable stents that are delivered with expandable 
catheters, such as balloon catheters, the stents are 
positioned over the balloon portion of the catheter and 
expanded from a reduced diameter to an enlarged diameter 
greater than or equal to the diameter of the artery wall, by 
inflating the balloon. Stents of this type can be expanded 
to an enlarged diameter by deforming the stent, by 
engagement of the stent walls with respect to one another, 
and by one-way engagement of the stent walls together with 
endothelial tissue growth into the stent. Other stents are 
self-expanding, by virtue of the properties of the material 
constituting the stent or by other aspects of the design.  According to a first aspect of the present invention 
there is provided an intraluminal stent implantable in a 
body lumen, comprising: a plurality of rings having at least 
a pair of overlapping edges; a plurality of teeth on at 
least one of said overlapping edges; whereby said rings are 
expanded from a first diameter to an adjustable, enlarged 
diameter so that said teeth engage in an interlocking 
relationship to hold said rings in said enlarged diameter 
form. Advantageously the stent has a longitudinal axis, and 
further comprises a longitudinally extending portion 
connecting said rings to one another. Preferably one of 
said overlapping edges has at least one slot and the other 
of said overlapping edges has at least one tab, said tab 
engaging said slot to form said interlocking relationship. 
Preferably said slot contains said teeth. Preferably said 
teeth in said slot are connected to adjacent teeth 
transverse to said teeth in said slot. Alternatively, said 
tab contains said teeth. Advantageously the stent has a longitudinal

An intraluminal stent implantable in a body lumen, 
comprising: a plurality of rings having at least a pair of 

overlapping edges; a plurality of teeth on at least one of 
said overlapping edges; whereby said rings are expanded from 

a first diameter to an adjustable, enlarged diameter so that 
said teeth engage in an interlocking relationship to hold 

said rings in said enlarged diameter form. 
An intraluminal stent implantable in a body lumen, 
comprising: a cylindrical body portion formed of a sheet 

having longitudinally extending overlapping edges; a 
plurality of tabs located on one edge of said sheet; a 

plurality of slots on said sheet corresponding with and 
aligning with said tabs; whereby said slots receive said 

tabs. 
An intraluminal stent implantable in a body lumen, 
comprising: a cylindrical body portion having an axial 

length extending along a longitudinal direction, said 
cylindrical body portion formed of a sheet having a first 

longitudinal edge and a second longitudinal edge, an 
elongated slot in said sheet on said first 

longitudinal edge, said elongated slot adapted to receive 
said second longitudinal edge. 
An intraluminal stent implantable in a body lumen, 
comprising: at least one strip disposed along a longitudinal 

direction, said strip forming a ring having overlapping 
edges; a slot disp
osed in said stent, said slot receiving

comprising: a substantially cylindrical body portion having 

a length extending along a longitudinal direction, said 
body portion having a first edge that contains a slot 

extending along said longitudinal direction, and said body 
portion having a second edge extending along said 

longitudinal direction; said second edge passing through 
said slot; wherein when said cylindrical body portion is 

expanded from a first reduced diameter to a second, enlarged 
diameter, said at least one of said edges undergoes greater
