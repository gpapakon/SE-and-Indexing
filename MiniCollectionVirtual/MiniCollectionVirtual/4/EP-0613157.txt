<ABSTRACT>
A membrane switch (10) including first and second substantially 
flexible electrical contacts (18) and a first 

layer (22) of dielectric material deposited between and on 
one surface of one of the first or second contacts. the 

first layer (22) is deposited in a pre-determined geometric 
pattern including a plurality of cells (30) defined by cell 

walls (32). The cell walls (32) are broken in pre-determined 
positions about their perimeter so that during 

and after actuation of the switch air within a cell (30) 
between the first and second contacts (18) can vent to one 

or more adjoining cells (30) to enable activation and 
prevent a vacuum from forming between the first and second 

contacts (18) thereby enabling the switch to break contact 
after being depressed. Such a switch (10) 
is particularly 
useful to overlie an air bag (44) mounted in the centre of 

a steering wheel and to operate a horn and other 
accessories.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to membrane switches, 
and more particularly to a membrane switch which can be 
utilized in an air bag assembly for an automobile. Membrane switches typically include two opposing 
surfaces, each of which include circuits thereon which, 
when engaged, complete the desired electrical circuit. To 
maintain the two opposing surfaces apart and the circuit in 
an open state, some type of insulating layer or spacer is 
disposed between the two substrates. An example of such a membrane switch is illustrated in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,382,165 which discloses two circuit 
sheets, one of which is adhered to a backer or stiffener 
board. Each sheet includes circuit patterns on opposing 
surfaces including circuit paths and circular contact pads 
thereon. An extremely thin non-conductive adhesive layer 
is applied between the circuit patterns which covers the 
circuit paths but includes apertures at the position of 
each circular contact pad. In order to prevent unintentional 
short circuiting from tolerance variations or 
sagging of the circuit sheets, a discontinuous layer of 
adhesive in the form of lines or dots is applied in the 
apertured areas. Such a switch, however, must be utilized with a backer 
board and cannot provide variable actuation forces since 
wide spacing between the lines or dots causes sagging while 
small spacing can prevent ready actuation of the switch. 
Additionally, since the adhesive provides a seal about the 
apertured areas, a vacuum can be created when the switch is 
depressed preventing release of the contacts. Another membrane switch is illustrated in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,602,135 which discloses two sheets having opposing 
surface where one surface includes switch leads and the 
other surface includes circuit completing material. A non-conductive 
spacer is positioned between the switch leads  
 
and the circuit completing material where the spacer is 
formed as a grid made up of squares. As with the above described patent, a vacuum 
frequently is created between the layers of the switch when 
depressed which prevents release and breaking of the 
circuit. Additionally, such a switch also requires a stiff 
backing or mounting surface to enable activation. Document WO/90/10204 discloses a membrane switch 
comprising first and second substantially flexible 
electrical contact means and a first layer of dielectric 
material deposited between and on one surface of one of 
said first or second contact means, said first layer being 
deposited in a pre-determined

<CLAIMS>
A membrane switch comprising first and second substantially 
flexible electrical contact means (18, 20) and a 

first layer of dielectric material (22) deposited between 
and on one surface of one of said first or second contact 

means (18), said first layer (22) being deposited in a 
pre-determined geometric pattern including a plurality of 

cells (30) defined by cell walls (32), wherein said cell 
walls (32) are broken in pre-determined positions (34) 

about the perimeter of each cell (30) so that, during and 
after actuation of said switch, air within any cell (30) 

between said first and second contact means (18) can vent 
to one or more adjoining cells (30), characterised in that 

said geometric pattern includes a series of hexagons 
defining a plurality of cells (30) where each of the six 

sides of the hexagons are broken proximate a mid-point 
thereof to enable activation and prevent a vacuum from 

forming between said first and second contact means (18) 
thereby enabling said switch to break contact after being 

depressed. 
A membrane switch as defined in claim 1, wherein said 
first and second contact means are provided by depositing 

a conductive layer of material (18) on a respective first 
and second flexible substrate (20). 
A membrane switch as defined in claim 1 or 2, 
including a second layer of dielectric material (22) 

deposited on the surface of the other of said first and 
second contact means opposite said first layer (22), said 

second layer (22) being deposited in a pre-determined 
geometric pattern substantially identical to said first 

layer and wherein said cell walls (32) of said first and 
second layers are in alignment. 
A membrane switch as defined in any preceding claim, 
wherein said first and second electrical contact means are 

secured about their perimeters with an adhesive (16) to  
 

environmentally protect the switch contacts (18) by 
preventing infiltration of the elements there-between. 
A membrane switch as defined in any preceding claim, 
wherein a resilient member (46) is provided on an exterior 

surface of at least one of said first and second contact 
means (18, 20) to distribute both mechanical and electrical 

switch loads over more than one cell (30). 
An air bag assembly (40), comprising: 

housing means (42) having at least one opening therethrough; 
air bag means (44) mounted within said housing means 
(42); 
an outer cover member (46) enclosing said at least one 
opening in said housing (42) and securing said air bag 

means (44) therein, said outer cover (46) capable of 
enabling release of said air bag means (44) through said 

opening in said housing (42) when activated; and 
a membrane switch means (10) in accordance with any 
one of the preceding claims, mounted between said air bag 

means (44) and said outer cover (46) which can be activated 
by a user through said outer cover (46), enable unimpeded 

deployment of said air bag means (44) while preventing 
damage to said air bag means (44) and injury to a user.
