<ABSTRACT>
The acoustomechanical disturbing feedback in a hearing aid having an amplifying filter section is compensated by means of a compensator (15). In this case, the signals are joined in the frequency range at the compensator (15) and preferably also in the amplifying filter section (5). For this purpose, time range/frequency range transformation units (20, 28), or corresponding back-transformation units (26, 24) are connected downstream of a subtraction unit (13) to which the compensator signal is coupled.
