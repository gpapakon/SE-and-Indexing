<ABSTRACT>
The present invention principally relates to a process for manufacturing a composite foodstuff and to a foodstuff obtained by the said process. The subject of the invention is a process comprising the steps consisting in:   - baking the pastry until golden brown during a prior cooking stage at a suitable temperature;   - placing the pastry and the stuffing in a package; - vacuum-packing and sealing the package containing the pastry and the stuffing; - cooking the foodstuff comprising the pastry and the stuffing in the package at a temperature which does not degrade the organoleptic properties of the stuffing.   The invention applies mainly to the fish and meat processing industries.

A method of manufacturing a food product, characterised in that it
incorporates the following steps, consisting in:


a) manufacturing an edible sheet, which may be solid or elastic (2),
from a raised dough with a flour base;
b) manufacturing a stuffing (8);
c) arranging the sheet (2) to form a casing;
d) filling the casing (6) with the stuffing (8), the stuffing (8) being placed
in contact with one of the main faces of the sheet (2);
e) vacuum-sealing the casing (6), in particular with a seal made from
a plastics material (11);
f) cooking the food product in its vacuum-sealed casing (6).
Method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that two substantially
parallel sheets (2) are disposed on two opposing faces of the food product.
Method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the sheet
(2) is formed from a raised dough of the blini type.
Method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
at step a), the sheet (2) is cooked, in particular the raised dough is browned.
Method as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that it includes, at
step a), the formation of irregularities on the surface of the main face of the

sheet (2) which is intended to be placed in contact with the stuffing (8).
Method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that, at step b), a stuffing containing 7 to 10% by weight of

proteins is prepared.
Method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the stuffing (8) is fluid prior to cooking, in particular a fine

paste with a fish base.
Method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that, at step f), cooking is effected at a temperature below or 

equal to 90Â°C.
Method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that, at step f), cooking is effected at a pressure higher than

the ambient pressure.
