<ABSTRACT>
A polyamide fibrous substrate having deposited on it 
an amount of a composition effective to impart stain-resistance 

comprising a water-soluble or water-dispersible 
alpha-olefin/maleic anhydride polymer or a mixture of said 

polymers, and processes for preparing the substrates. The 
maleic anhydride polymer is used either in hydrolyzed form 

or in the form resulting from reacting it with a lower 
alkyl alcohol so as to form an alpha-olefin/maleic acid 

monoalkyl ester polymer

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polyamide
textile substrates treated with stain-resistant
compositions comprising water-soluble or
water-dispersible maleic anhydride/ alpha-olefin
polymers, and processes for their synthesis. The
substrates of this invention possess stain-resistance
but do not suffer from yellowing to the extent that
some previously known materials do.Polyamide substrates, such as nylon carpeting,
upholstery fabric and the like, are subject to staining
by a variety of agents, e.g., foods and beverages. An
especially troublesome staining agent is FD&C Red Dye
No. 40, commonly found in soft drink preparations.
Different types of treatments have been proposed to
deal with staining problems. One approach is to apply
a highly fluorinated polymer to the substrate. Another
is to use a composition containing a sulfonated
phenol-formaldehyde condensation product.For example, Liss et al., in U.S. Patent No.
4,963,409, disclose stain-resistant synthetic polyamide
textile substrates having deposited on them sulfonated
phenol-formaldehyde polymeric condensation products.
However, sulfonated phenol-formaldehyde condenation
products are themselves subject to discoloration;
commonly they turn yellow. Yellowing problems are
described by W. H. Hemmpel in a March 19, 1982 article
in America's Textiles, entitled Reversible Yellowing
Not Finisher's Fault. Hemmpel attributes yellowing to
exposure of a phenol-based finish to nitrogen oxides 
and/or ultraviolet radiation. To deal with the
yellowing problem, the condensation products were
modified by Liss et al. by acylation or etherification
of some of the phenolic hydroxyls. In a preferred
embodiment disclosed by Liss et al., the modified
condensation products were dissolved in a hydroxy-containing
solvent, such as ethylene glycol prior to
there being applied to the textile substrate.Allen et al., in U.S. Patent 3,835,071,
disclose rug shampoo compositions which upon drying
leave very brittle, non-tacky residues which are easily
removed when dry. The compositions comprise water-soluble
metal, ammonium or amine salt of a styrenemaleic
anhydride copolymer, or its half ester, and a
detergent. Water-soluble metal salts of Group II and
the alkali metals (particularly magnesium and sodium)
are preferred and ammonium salts are most preferred by
Allen et al.On the other hand, Fitzgerald et al., in EP-A 0 329 899,
disclose the usefulness of aqueous
solutions of hydrolyzed vinylaromatic/maleic anhydride
copolymers in the treatment of textiles to render them
resistant
