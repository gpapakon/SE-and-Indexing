<ABSTRACT>
A method for assembling a vacuum insulation panel is provided which includes 
the steps of: loading a quantity of microporous powder into a gas permeable pouch; 

pressing the pouch into a desired form; sealing the pouch; heating the powder to a 
temperature elevated above standard room temperature; inserting the pouch into a 

gas impermeable bag while the pouch and powder remain at the elevated 
temperature; evacuating gases from the powder pouch while it is at the elevated 

temperature; evacuating gases from the bag; and sealing the gas evacuated bag with 
the gas evacuated pouch therein to form a vacuum insulation panel. The heating of 

the powder may occur only just before insertion of the pouch into the bag, or may 
occur both before the powder is loaded into the pouch as well as just before insertion 

of the pouch into the bag. Further, a trace amount of Helium (at a pressure of 
approximately 1mm Hg) may be put into the bag before it is sealed in order to permit 

testing of the sealed panel for leaks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vacuum panel assembly method, and in 
particular a method utilizing the powdered insulation material which is first inserted into 
a porous pouch and subsequentially sealed into an impermeable barrier bag. Vacuum insulation panels are useful in a variety of environments, and in 
particular in conjunction with refrigeration apparatus in which they are utilized as 
insulating panels in the walls of refrigerators and freezers. Typically a vacuum insulation panel has some type of insulating material, 
generally powders or microporous sheets of insulating material which are placed into 
an impermeable bag and, after evacuation of all gases, the bag is sealed. Such 
panels and a method for fabricating them are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,018,328, 
assigned to Whirlpool Corporation, the assignee of the present application, the 
disclosure of said patent being incorporated herein by reference, as well as in U.S. 
Patent Nos. 5,076,984 and 4,683,702. The use of a gas permeable enclosure to contain the powder during evacuation 
is disclosed in the '984 and '702 patents listed above. The use of multiple 
compartments in an insulation panel is disclosed in the '328 patent. U.S. 5,076,984 
discloses a method in accordance with the preamble of claim 1. The present invention provides a method for assembling vacuum panels in a 
significantly improved process over other presently known processes. Two embodiments of the invention are set forth herein. In a first embodiment, 
the microporous powder is initially heated and dried and transferred, under a dry  
 
nitrogen (or air) blanket, to a hopper. A vacuum filling machine is utilized to fill a 
microporous pouch with the powder from the hopper and to seal the pouch. The filled 
pouch is then reheated so that the powder is at an elevated temperature at the time 
that the pouch is then inserted into a partially formed panel. The panel then 
undergoes vacuum processing in which gases are removed from interior of the panel 
prior to a sealing of the panel. It has been determined that the reheating of the 
powder just prior to insertion of the pouch into the panel greatly reduces the time 
required for the vacuum processing of the panel, and/or permits a higher vacuum to 
be achieved within the panel given the same evacuation period as a non-reheated 
pouch. As an option, during the vacuum processing of the panel a very small and 
specific trace amount of helium (preferably below 1mm Hg pressure so not to affect its 
superior thermal

A method of assembling a vacuum insulation panel comprising the 
steps: 


1) loading (62; 122) a quantity of microporous powder into a 
gas permeable pouch; 
2) sealing (62; 122) said pouch; 
3) heating (26, 64; 124) said powder to a temperature elevated 
above standard room temperature; 
4) removing moisture (26; 124) from said powder; 
5) inserting (66, 126) said pouch into a gas impermeable bag; 
6) evacuating gases (62; 122) from said powder pouch; 
7) evacuating gases (102; 128) from said bag; and 
8) sealing (102; 128) said gas evacuated bag with said gas 
evacuated pouch therein to form a vacuum insulation panel; characterised in

   said steps of inserting said pouch into said gas impermeable bag 

and evacuating gases from said powder pouch are carried out while said pouch 
and powder remain at said elevated temperature. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein said heating of said 
powder (26, 64) occurs both before said powder is loaded into said pouch and 

again just prior to insertion of said pouch into said bag.
