<DESCRIPTION>
 AUTOMATIC GAIN CONTROL APPARATUS FOR ADIGITAL TELEVISION SIGNAL RECEIVERThis invention concerns apparatus in a television signal receiving system for automatically controlling the magnitude of a received television signal representative of digital image information.Standard television signal receiving systems typically include automatic gain control (AGC) apparatus for maintaining the magnitude of a signal applied to a detector stage substantially constant over a wide range of received signal levels. Such AGC apparatus typically generates an AGC voltage as a function of the amplitude of the horizontal sync component of a detected baseband video signal component. The AGC voltage is used to increase or decrease the gain of radio frequency (RF) and intermediate frequency (IF) amplifiers as an inverse function of the magnitude of the received television signal. Television signal AGC systems of this type are well known as described, for example, in U.S. Patent 4,761,687 — Rumreich. Much attention has been devoted recently to the development of high definition television systems that encode and decode television information, e.g., image, audio and synchronizing information, in digital form. A transmitted digital television signal differs from a standard NTSC analog television signal in that it appears to be a random sequence of pulses, resembling a random noise signal of varying amplitude, and it may lack an RF carrier. Thus it may be difficult or impossible to use standard AGC techniques effectively for a digital television signal, due to the lack of an easily identifiable AGC reference component such as an RF carrier or a horizontal sync component similar to that of a standard NTSC television signal.In recognition of these factors there is disclosed herein an AGC network suitable for use in a digital television signal receiving system. The disclosed AGC network is advantageously 

able to reject the effects of time varying interference phenomena such as aircraft induced flutter, and may be advantageously used in a high definition QAM digital television signal system having a spectrally shaped amplitude versus frequency response. An example of such is shown in U.S. patent application Serial No. 650,329 of Hugh Edward White. In that system, a transmitted high definition television signal lacking an RF carrier and an easily identifiable NTSC-type horizontal sync component is divided into high priority information that is intended to be received with high reliability, and low priority information.

CLAIMS:
1. In a system for receiving a television signal, apparatus comprising: input signal processing means (1 10,112) having an input for receiving an analog signal representative of digital television information, and an output; digital signal processing means (116) responsive to said output signal from said input signal processing means; video signal processing means (119,140,144) for providing an image representative signal in response to an output signal from said digital signal processing means; and automatic gain control means (160) including a root — mean — square (RMS) amplitude detector means (166) for developing a control signal as a function of the magnitude of a received signal for automatically controlling the magnitude of signals provided to said digital signal processing means.
