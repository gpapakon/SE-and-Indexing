<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a compound
for processing a silver halide photographic material and
a processing process therewith.In general, a silver halide black and white
photographic material is processed in the processing processes
such as black and white developing, fixing and rinsing after
exposing, and a silver halide color photographic material
(hereinafter referred to as a color light-sensitive material)
is processed in the processing processes such as color
developing, desilvering, rinsing and stabilizing after
exposing. A silver halide color reversal material is
processed in a processing process such as black and white
developing after exposing and in the processing processes such
as color developing, desilvering, rinsing and stabilizing
after a reversal processing.In a color developing process of a color development
processing, an exposed silver halide grain is reduced to
silver by a color developing agent and at the same time a
generated oxidation product of the color developing agent
reacts with a coupler to form a dye image.In the subsequent desilvering process, developed
silver generated in the developing process is oxidized 
(bleaching) by a bleaching agent (an oxidant) having an
oxidizing action to a silver salt, and further it is removed
(fixing) from a light-sensitive layer together with unexposed
silver halide by a fixing agent which forms soluble silver.
There are a case in which bleaching and fixing are carried out
independently in a bleaching process and a fixing step,
respectively, and a case in which they are simultaneously
carried out in a bleach-fixing process. The details of these
processing processes and the compositions thereof are
described in The Theory of Photographic Process written by
James, the 4th edition (1977), and Research Disclosures No.
17643, pp. 28 to 29, No. 18716, 651, a left column to a
right column, and No.307105, pp. 880 to 881.In addition to the above fundamental processing
processes, various auxiliary processes are supplementarily
carried out for a purpose of maintaining a photographic and
physical quality of a dye image or a processing stability.
They include, for example, a rinsing process, a stabilizing
process, a hardening process and a stopping process.Processing is carried out in a reducer containing an
oxidant in order to adjust a gradation of a silver halide
black and white light-sensitive material which is subjected to
a development processing.In general, a ferric ethylenediaminetetraacetate
complex salt and a ferric
