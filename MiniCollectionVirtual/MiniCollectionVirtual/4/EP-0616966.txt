<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for preventing a broken printing web 
from wrapping about or otherwise fouling the blanket cylinders of 

printing press units. The system and method includes a web 
tensioning device located downstream of the printing press units 

for maintaining tension upon a broken web and pulling the web from 
the printing press units. The devic
e includes a plurality of web 
disturbance detectors for detecting a wave, ripple or other 

disturbance indicative of a web break. A pair of anti-wrap rollers 
located above and below the web are engaged upon detection of a web 

break to engage the web between them to exert tension onto the web 
and pull it from the printing units. The anti-wrap rollers are 

rotated at a surface speed nominally greater than the surface speed 
of the printing rolls. The anti-wrap rollers include a plurality 

of opposed peak and valley portions which enable them to interlock 
and grip the web along a line of contact.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and a system for
preventing damage to a printing unit of a printing press in the
event of a substantial loss of tension in a running web exiting
from the printing unit such as would be caused by a break in the
web. The invention is particularly useful in the commercial
heat-set printing market where the printed product exits to dryer
and chill units.In a typical printing unit the printed product is discharged
from the printing unit and typically is directed downstream
through a dryer unit, followed by a chill unit. Problems occur
when a web break occurs downstream of the press such as in the
dryer or chill unit.Should there be a web break there is a possibility that
the web will be directed back to the printing press where it will
become entangled in the press rolls. More particularly, the end off
the printing web may wrap around the blanket cylinder damaging the
blanket and resulting in substantial down time and blanket expense.
This problem is particularly acute when the operator is not even
aware of the web break.The prior art has suggested several solutions to the
problem. One proposed solution is to provide sensor means for
detecting web breaks within the dryer and/or chill units. The
detectors may be of the air, infra-red, photoelectric, contact,
ultrasonic or other type capable of detecting a web break and
signalling such information to a circuit which would cause the
press to stop its operation. However, the press may be running at
speeds of 5,08-15,24  m / s (1,000 to to 3,000 feet per minute). The press rolls do not 
stop immediately but periodically decelerate over a period of time
perhaps ten seconds. During this period of time, substantial
printed product can be emitted from the press causing damage to the
blankets by wrapping in the printing units.In order to alleviate the problem some prior art devices
utilize a web break detector which not only provides a signal which
stops the press but also activates knife means or other severing
device which severs the web. Preferably, the web severing device
is located before the dryer so as to reduce the amount of untensioned
web. But since there is a period of time before the
press stops, there remains the possibility that the untensioned web
will go back to the press units and be wrapped around the blanket
cylinders.In prior art web break detectors, the web break is
detected mechanically, optically or electrically which activates a
shearing mechanism downstream of the printing unit and shuts down
the printing

a web breakage downstream of the printing press unit,

comprising: a) upper and lower roll means (60A, 60B)
positioned downstream of the printing cylinde
rs (5),

another from a disengaged position wherein they are

spaced apart from the running web and an engaged
position wherein they are in contact with the running

web;
b) means (100, 105, 110, 120) for causing rotation
