<CLAIMS>
Filter cartridge (10) with an outer and inner 
filter casing (12, 14), the filter casings being designed 

as concertinas, the two filter casings being designed in 
each case in the manner of a circular-cylindrical cone 

frustum, the smaller end face of the outer cone frustum 
(12) being present in the region of the larger end face 

of the inner cone frustum (14), so that the two filter 
casings are oriented in a V-shaped manner relative to one 

another in a longitudinal section, and, in each case, the 
upper end of the outer concertina (12) being held in an 

upper outer mounting ring (24) and the upper end of the 
inner concertina (14) being held in an upper inner 

mounting ring (30), characterized in that the two filter 
casings are present as two individual concertinas (12, 

14), and the two concertinas are jointly held with their 
lower ends in a lower mounting ring (16). 
Filter cartridge according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that a supporting device (18, 20) for each of the 

respective filter concertinas (12, 14) is present on the 
clean-gas side of the filter concertinas (12, 14). 
Filter cartridge according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the supporting device (18, 20) is designed 

as a supporting basket in the manner of a cone frustum 
with approximately circular base areas or with base areas 

in the manner of polygons. 
Filter cartridge according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that, in the interior (44) having a V-shaped 

cross-section, a supporting basket matched 
circumferentially to this interior is present between the 

two filter concertinas (12, 14).
