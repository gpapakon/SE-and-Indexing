<ABSTRACT>
A counting arrangement with fast reset is specified which, in particular, is suitable for use in signal processors and which has a counter 1 which is supplied with a counting clock at the input end and the output signal of which is supplied to a first register 2 clocked with the counting clock and to a second register 3 clocked with a reset signal, and which has a superimposition stage 4 by means of which the output signal of the second clocked register 3 is substracted from the output signal of the first clocked register 2 and which supplies the output signal of the counting device.

<CLAIMS>
A rapidly resettable counting device comprising a counter (1) to which a
clock signal is applied at the input side and whose output signal is applied to a first

register (2) clocked by the clock signal and to a second register (3) clocked by a reset
signal, and comprising a summing stage (4) by means of which the output signal of the

second clocked register (3) is subtracted from the output signal of the first clocked
register (2), which stage supplies the output signal of the counting device.
characterized in that
 the counter (1) is a modulo-m counter, and the counter comprises a
plurality of parallel-connected sub-counters (11, 12, 13, ..., 15) to which the clock

signal divided by the number of sub-counters is applied, which sub-counters operate
each shifted by one clock period, and the output signals of said sub-counters are

combined by means of a multiplexer (17).
The use of the counting device as claimed in Claim 1 in a signal
processor.
The use of the counting device as claimed in Claim 1 for detecting the
position of a pixel of a picture signal of a digital television signal within a picture line,

the reset signal indicating the beginning of the picture line.
