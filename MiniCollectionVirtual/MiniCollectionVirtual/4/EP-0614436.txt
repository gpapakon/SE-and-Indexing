<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to packing elements and more particularly relates to 
elements that are used to protect a product packed in a container such as a box. 
Specifically, the container and the product therein are each of a predetermined size 
and shape. Many products that are manufactured and ultimately sold for and used by 
an end user -- whether it be a company or an individual -- must be shipped at least 
once from where the product is produced to where the product is stored, consumed 
or used. In actuality, a product may be shipped several times, such as from the 
manufacturer to the distributor, to the warehouse, then to a retail store and 
ultimately to an end user. It is of course necessary that the product be protected 
during this time of shipping and storage so that it ultimately reaches the end user 
in an unharmed condition. A very widely used -- and indeed almost universally used -- packaging 
system for protecting products that could be easily damaged during shipping and 
storage -- typically items such as electrical or electronic appliances -- consists of 
a cardboard box with packing material interposed between the product and the 
inner walls of the cardboard box. The packing material displaces the product from 
the cardboard box around all sides of the product so that almost any impact on the 
cardboard box will not directly reach the product. Further, the packing material 
preferably keeps the product in a fixed relation with respect to the cardboard box 
so that the product does not move around within the cardboard box. In order to 
keep the product in fixed relation within the cardboard box, it is necessary that the 
product fit snugly within the packing material and also that the packing material 
fit snugly within the cardboard box.  
 Two types of forces may be encountered by a packed product during 
shipping and storage. Firstly, there is movement of the cardboard box, which may 
be quite sudden or severe. This sudden or severe movement would cause the 
cardboard box to experience related accelerative and decelerative forces. 
Correspondingly, the product inside must move along with the cardboard box, and 
if there is no cushioning between the product and the cardboard box, the product 
would experience roughly the same accelerative and decelerative forces experienced 
by the cardboard box. Secondly, there are impact forces that can occur as a result 
of a sudden impact with the cardboard box by another object. Again, the 
accelerative forces are transmitted through the box to

A modular supporting structure (20) for positioning and supporting a product 
within an outer packing container, wherein said product to be supported has predetermined 

external dimensions, and said outer packing container forms a chamber of predetermined 
internal dimensions; wherein said supporting structure comprises a plurality of modules (22) 

interconnected one to another, wherein each module has an exterior surface (40) that is 
generally shaped and sized so as to correspond to a portion of said predetermined internal 

dimensions of said outer packing container, and each module has an inwardly directed 
receiving surface (44) that is generally shaped and sized so as to correspond to a portion of 

said predetermined external dimensions of said product; and wherein said modular supporting 
structure having a predetermined shaped product-receiving socket (24) defined by said inwardly 

directed surfaces of said plurality of modules;
 
   
characterized by
 each module in turn comprising an at least 
partially inflated bladder (30, 32), and a connecting portion (34) that is attached to said bladder 

of each respective module;
 
   wherein each of said bladders has a first compartment (30) for receiving and 

retaining an inflating gas;
 
   said plurality of modules being separably connected one to another by way of 

said connecting portions so as to form said modular supporting structure; and
 
   wherein said modules are maintained physically separated from each other by 

said connecting portions being interconnected, whereby said modules act independently of each 
other in terms of the load supported by each. 
The modular supporting structure of claim 1, further comprising a second 
compartment (32) in each of said bladders. 
The modular supporting structure of claim 2, wherein said first and second 
compartments are connected by a restrictive air passage (48) that limits the rate of flow of air 

between said first and second compartments.  
 
The modular supporting structure of claim 1, wherein each of said connecting 
portions includes a flange (34) having a protruding locking member (64) and a cooperating 

opening (66) for receiving a locking member, wherein said locking member is received and 
retained by a cooperating opening in an adjacent module. 
The modular supporting structure of claim 1, wherein said modular supporting 
structure comprises four modules connected together in the shape of a cruciform. 
The modular supporting structure of claim 1, wherein said modules include 

means to allow the modules to connect together in a plurality of positions with respect to one 
another so as to allow said modules to form modular supporting structures of various sizes. 
The modular supporting structure of claim 1, wherein each of said modules has 
a deflation cap (54) to allow for inflation and deflation of each respective bladder. 
The modular supporting structure of claim 1, further including an interconnecting 
member (104 or 113) that is connected to said connecting portion of each of said modules and 

spans between and connects said modules. 
The modular supporting structure of claim 8, wherein each connecting portion 
is an integral part of said inwardly directed surface of its respective module. 
The modular supporting structure of claim 8, wherein each of said modules has 
a slot (111) therein, with each slot being adapted to receive a portion of said interconnecting 

member (113), and wherein each connecting portion is an integral part of each of said modules.
