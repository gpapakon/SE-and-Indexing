<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a method and an apparatus (10) for producing ribbed tubes from plastic, which have an inner layer (32) with a smooth inner tube surface and an outer layer (38) with a corrugated outer surface (34). Used as the material for the outer layer (38) is an unsegregated, washed and shredded recycled material, which is mixed with a suitable blowing agent, for example in a stuffer (42) and is introduced through a first extruder into a die head (12), from which it emerges separately from the virgin material for the tubular inner layer (32) and at the same time concentrically surrounding the latter, the material for the outer layer (38) expanding after leaving the die head (12) in the space between the inner layer (32) and the mould jaws (18) of a corrugator (16).

Method for producing ribbed tubes made of 
plastic, which tubes have an inner layer (32) having a 

smooth inner tube surface and an outer layer (38) having 
a corrugated outer surface (40), the material for the 

inner layer (32) and the material for the outer layer 
(38) being extruded simultaneously and separately from 

one another through an extrusion head (12) into a mould 
cavity which is defined by a cooling mandrel (14) which 

adjoins the extrusion head (12), and the mould jaws (18) 
of a corrugator (16), one layer of the tube being formed 

by a foam which expands by means of a chemical blowing 
agent, characterized in that an unsorted, washed and 

comminuted recycled material is used as material for the 
outer layer (38) which has a ribbed longitudinal section, 

which recycled material, having been mixed with a 
suitable blowing agent, is introduced through a first 

extruder provided with a stuffing unit (42) or another 
type of forced feed, into the extrusion head (12) from 

which it emerges separately from the new-grade material 
for the tubular inner layer (32) and concentrically 

surrounding the latter, and the material for the outer 
layer (38), after emerging from the extrusion head (12), 

is foamed in the space between the inner layer (32) and 
the mould jaws (18) of the corrugator. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that air is fed between the inner layer (32) and the 

cooling mandrel (14). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that an arbitrary mixture of customary polyolefins, 

excluding PVC, is used for the outer layer (38).  
 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a sorted plastic material is used for the inner 

layer (32).
