A dual-control steering system for a moving vehicle having a
platform (2) on which a moving and/or swivel-mounted working

structure (6) is fitted, with drive members powered from a working
power hydraulic circuit (28), said vehicle having a "main" driving

position (4) and a "secondary" driving position (12) installed on the
platform, each of said positions having a respective steering wheel

(5, 16) suitable for acting selectively to control steering members
(3
1
) of the vehicle, said steering system including a dual inlet
steering and control unit comprising:


an angle deflector box (20) comprising:

a half-shaft (37) forming, outside the box, an inlet
endpiece (38) for linking to the steering wheel (5) of the main

driving position;
a first shaft portion constrained to rotate with said
half-shaft (37) and forming, outside the box, an outlet endpiece (40)

designed to be constrained to rotate with a control member of the
steering members (3
1
): and
a second shaft portion forming, outside the box, an
inlet endpiece (41); and
a both-way hydraulic motor (30) whose outlet shaft (47) is
disposed on the same axis as the inlet endpiece (41) of the second

shaft portion, said motor being powered under the control of the
steering wheel (16) of the secondary control position via a steering

circuit;

the steering system being characterized in that:

the first and second shaft portions are interconnected
to form a through shaft (39);
the hydraulic motor is powered by the power circuit
(28) via the steering circuit; and
an electromagnetic clutch (45) is interposed between
the outlet shaft (47) of the hydraulic motor and the inlet endpiece

(41) of the through shaft (39) and is powered electrically from the
secondary control position.
A steering system according to claim 1, characterized in that the
clutch (45) is of the type having an unclutched rest position. 
A steering system according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the clutch (45) comprises:


a driving plate (46) constrained to rotate with the outlet
shaft (47) of the hydraulic motor (30) and associated with an annular

electromagnetic coil (49) carried by a fixed structure (48) secured
to the base of the motor;
a driven plate (51) constrained to rotate with the inlet
endpiece (41) of the through shaft; and
a friction disk (54) constrained to rotate with the driven
plate (51) and interposed between it and the driving plate.
A steering system according to claim 1, 2, or 3, characterized in
that the clutch has a driven plate (51) which is mounted by means of

a centering ball bearing (52) on the outlet shaft (47) of the
hydraulic motor (30).
A steering system according to claim 1, characterized in that the
box (20) and the hydraulic motor (30) are mounted on a common plate

(42).
