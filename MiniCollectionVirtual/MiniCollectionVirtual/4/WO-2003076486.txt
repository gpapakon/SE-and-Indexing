<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to water dispersible finishing compositions for fibrous substrates including fibers, fabrics, carpets, nonwoven webs, and the like. The finishing compositions can impart to the fibrous substrate soil resistance and a range of hydrophilic properties from water repellency to water absorbency. Preferably, the finishing compositions can impart stain resistance to the fibrous substrate. The invention also relates to methods for treating fibrous substrates with the finishing compositions of this invention. The compositions can be applied to the substrate and subsequently cured at ambient temperature or above.

 WATER DISPERSIBLE FINISHING COMPOSITIONS FOR FIBROUS SUBSTRATESField of the InventionThe invention relates to finishing compositions that can be dispersed in water and applied to fibrous substrates such as fibers, fabrics, carpets or nonwoven webs and subsequently cured to impart to the substrate soil resistance as well as a range of hydrophilic properties from water repellency to water absorbency.Background of the InventionThe treatment of fibrous substrates with fluorochemical compounds rendering them repellant to water and resistant to soiling and staining has been known in the art for many years. Fluorochemical repellent compositions are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,672,651 (Smith), U.S. Pat. No. 5,350,795 (Smith et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,738,687 (Kamrath et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 4,264,484 (Patel), U.S. Pat. No. 6,074,436 (Wang et al.), and WO 98/50616 (Clark et al.). Although these materials have performed well in terms of water and stain repellency, there is growing concern about health and environmental issues associated with some fluorochemical compounds. This invention provides finishing compositions that are free of fluorochemicals.Aqueous polyurethane dispersions have been used to impart moisture resistance to textiles. For example, WO 00/37535 (Moore) discloses dispersions that can be used to prepare polyurethane carpet backings and polyurethane textile backings. Additionally,U.S. Pat. No. 6,048,925 (Titterington et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,773,490 (Shikinami et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 4,180,491 (Kim et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 3,402,148 (Sutker et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 3,362,780 (Kuth et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 4,082,703 (Duffey et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,164,421 (Kiamil et al.), and EP 0 335 276 Al (Anand) disclose various urethane formulations that are water dispersible. However, these compositions do not have the balance of hydrophilic and lipophilic properties desired for a finishing composition. 

 The invention provides water dispersible finishing compositions comprising one or more urethanes. The invention also provides methods of treating fibrous substrates with the finishing compositions. The finishing compositions show unexpectedly good properties such as soil and stain resistance as well as a range of hydrophilic properties from water repellency to water absorbency. These properties compare favorably with the state-of-the-art fluorochemical compositions.Summary of the InventionThe invention relates to finishing compositions that can be dispersed in water and applied to fibrous substrates such as
