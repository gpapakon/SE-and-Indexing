<ABSTRACT>
2.1 Especially fast gas sensors based on semiconducting metal oxides are suitable for cylindrically selective  lambda -control. These sensors are usually built into so-called sight casings, in order to protect the metal oxide layers, which are only a few  mu m thick, from the particles entrained in the exhaust gas. 2.2 The object of the invention is to obtain a sensor, especially a gas sensor, the casing of which guarantees irrotational flow around the sensor element and prevents deposition on the sensitive regions. 2.3 The sensor casing (1) resembles a whistle in design. It has a flow channel which is bent in an S-shape and joins an inlet opening (2) to an outlet opening (3). The planar sensor element (4) is arranged in a section of the channel, through which the flow is broadly laminar, behind a bend opening into the inlet opening (2). Since the heavier particles entrained in the gaseous or liquid medium cannot follow the curve of the channel, they impact on the channel wall and remain adhering thereto. The lighter particles possibly still entrained in the deviated flow are intercepted by a metal bar (5) mounted in front of the sensor element (4). 3.  lambda -probe.
