<DESCRIPTION>
 USE OF INJECTABLE BIOMATERIALS IN THE TREATMENT OF HEMORRHOIDSTechnical FieldThis invention is in the field of medical implants and prostheses. Specifically, it concerns a nonsurgical technique for treating hemorrhoids and pruritis ani, a related condition, by injecting biomaterials into the soft tissue of the anal verge.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The anatomy of the region known as the anal canal is complex and the etiology of the condition known as hemorrhoids has long been the subject of research and reexamination. The anal columns (folds of epithelia and muscle tissue) and anal sinuses (furrows separating the anal columns from each other) are found at the upper end of the anal canal. The anal sinuses end in valve-like folds, called the anal valves, and the anal canal is vascularized by veins derived from the superior and inferior rectal (hemorrhoidal) veins. The vascular tissues of the anal canal, known as the anal cushions, are found in the left lateral, right posterior, and right anterior positions of the anal canal, at or above the level of the anal valves. The anal cushions are submucosal and comprise blood vessels (mainly veins) supported by smooth muscle (Treitz's muscle) and connective tissue. The anal verge refers to the external or distal boundary of the anal canal; that is, the line where the anal walls contact during the normal state of apposition.Hemorrhoids are believed to be caused by breakdown in the connective tissue and smooth muscle that support the anal cushions, causing displacement of the cushions into the lumen of the distal canal. This is especially likely to occur when there is a history of constipation or prolonged straining at stool, leading to stretching or disruption of Treitz's muscle together with venous engorgement. Once the cushions are displaced, the venous engorgement may be perpetuated by a tight internal anal sphincter. 

 Each hemorrhoid consists of an internal and external component. The internal component lies above the line of the anal valves, known as the dentate or pectinate line. The external component lies below this line. The internal and external component are clearly distinguished by a groove and by a differential epithelial covering. The internal component is usually covered with columnar epithelium, while the external is covered with skin and stratified squamous epithelium.A number of predisposing factors for the development of hemorrhoids are known, such as heredity, pregnancy, and pelvic tumors. However, in the majority of patients, no explanation
