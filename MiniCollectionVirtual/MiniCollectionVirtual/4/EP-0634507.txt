<ABSTRACT>
The system contains closed-loop control for deriving controlled values from parameters which influence the productivity of the spinning machine (RS). In addition to parameters which are measured by sensors, the system also takes into account for the closed-loop control those parameters which cannot be measured or can only be measured with difficulty. The latter parameters are included in the closed-loop control by means of a fuzzy logic unit, for which purpose the closed-loop control has a fuzzy controller (FC).

System for increasing the production of spinning machines (RS), having sensors for measuring
parameters which influence the production, and having a control system comprising a

control stage (ST) connected to the sensors, a drive (MA) for the spinning machine acted
upon by regulated variables and a fuzzy controller (FC) disposed between control stage and

drive for deriving control variables from these parameters and for forming regulated variables
for the spinning machine from the control variables obtained, in which those parameters

which exhibit an unambiguous mathematical interrlationship with the respective control variable
are included in the control system by conventional algorithms, and a data input station

is provided through which further parameters which are not measurable or measurable only
with difficulty can be input into the control system, and those parameters which exhibit no

unambiguous mathematical interrelatonship with the respective control variable are included
in the control system by means of a fuzzy logic of a fuzzy controller, 
characterised in that
 the
non-measurable parameters are input into the fuzzy controller (FC) in accordance with human

perception, this input taking place in the form of fuzzy sets with differing values.
System according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the said non-measurable parameters
are formed by environmental or ambient factors and/or factors established subjectively by

the operating personnel.
System according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the said non-measurable parameters
are formed by the tendency to thunderstorm and/or by the workload of the operating personnel.
System according to one of claims 1 to 3, in which the regulated variables obtained act on
the drive of the spinning machine and influence its
 speed of rotation, 
characterised in that

nominal values are prescribed for the respective parameter and a permissible range is
prescribed for the speed of rotation, and 
in that
 the control of the speed of rotation takes
place in discrete steps.
