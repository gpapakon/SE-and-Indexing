<ABSTRACT>
According to the method: the element (1) is shaped flat, the element (1) is positioned in arrangements (3a) of a male counterform (3) (or female counterform) corresponding very substantially to the volumetric body (2), action is carried out on a means (4) capable of pressing the element (1) into the arrangements (3a), a film protecting the adhesive possessed by the element (1) is removed, the volumetric body (2) is positioned on (or in) the counterform (3) equipped with the element (1), action is carried out on the means (5) capable of transferring the element (1) from the counterform (3) into (or on) the volumetric body (2) and pressing it against the walls of the latter with a view to fastening it, in combination with its adhesion capacity.

Process to apply a masking element made of 
a deformable flexible material having an adhesive 

capability in or on a three-dimensional body, the 
element (1) being made so that it is flat and is 

positioned in the features (3a) of a male (or female) 
counter form (3) which essentially corresponds to the 

three-dimensional body (2), characterised in that: 

means (4) capable of pressing the element 
(1) into the features (3a) is operated, thus creating 

a negative-pressure force at the level of said 
features of the counter form (3), 
a protective film (1b) is removed from the 
adhesive on the element (1), 
the three-dimensional body (2) is positioned 
on (or in) counter form (3) fitted with the element 

(1), 
means (5) capable of creating a positive 
pressure is operated to transfer the element (1) from 

the counter form (3) in (or on) three-dimensional 
body (2) and pressing it against the walls of the 

latter in order to fix it in combination with its 
adhesive power. 
Device to implement the process as claimed 
in claim 1, characterised in that it comprises at 

least one male (or female) counter form which 
corresponds essentially to the three-dimensional body 

(2), said counter form (3) having features (3a) to 
position the element (1) with the counter form being 

controlled by means (4) and (5) respectively capable 
of creating a negative-pressure force to press 

element (1) into the features (3a) and a positive-pressure 
force capable of transferring said element  

 
(1) so that it can be fixed against the walls of the 

three-dimensional body (2) after it has been 
positioned on or in the counter form (3). 
Device as claimed in claim 2, 
characterised in that the features (3a) of the 

counter form (3) consist of recessed cavities formed 
in its thickness in a direction corresponding to the 

desired direction of element (1) in or on the three-dimensional 
body (2). 
Device as claimed in claim 2, 
characterised in that the means of pressing consist 

of a device (4) of the vacuum pump type capable of 
creating a negative pressure at the features (3a). 
Device as claimed in claim 4, 
characterised in that the beans of transfer consist 

of a device (5) capable of creating a gas pressure in 
order to push and expel the element by injecting air 

into the features (3a). 
Device as claimed in claims 4 and 5 
together, characterised in that the counter form (3) 

has internal ducts constituting an air circuit that 
is connected to vacuum pump (4) and compressor (5), 

said ducts communicating with a plurality of 
extremely small holes (3a1) in the features of the 

counter form (3). 
Device as claimed in claim 2, 
characterised in that the counter form (3) is made in 

several parts that are hingedly attached to a common 
base (6) and are controlled by resilient return 

components that are used to modify the volume of said 
counter form.  

 
Device as claimed in claim 2, 
characterised in that the three-dimensional body (2) 

and counter form (3) have additional means of angular 
indexing (2b) (6a).
