<ABSTRACT>
In the process of the invention for generating vibrations and their transfer to an acoustic irradiation fluid (11), the sound waves are generated by an acoustic probe (2) with an acoustic converter (6) and a resonator (3) attached thereto. According to the invention, the resonator (3) is surrounded by a compartment wall (9) and the space (7) between the resonator (3) and the wall (9) is filled with a transfer fluid (15) which transfers the vibrations from the surface of the resonator (3) to the irradiation fluid (11) surrounding the wall (9). The resonator (3) may be actuated regardless of the damping properties of the irradiation fluid (11) and the particles therein to be acoustically irradiated.
