<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, a cathodoluminescent anode (4, 6) is formed on an insulating substrate (2), and cathodic conductors (10), an insulating layer (12), a gate layer (14) intended for forming gates, holes (17) in the insulating layer and the gate layer, and micropoints (16) in these holes are formed on another insulating substrate (8). In addition, an insulating thin film (20) is formed on the gate layer, in order to limit the current which can flow between the anode and the gates. This thin film is associated with means (21) capable of preventing this electrically insulating thin film from disturbing the electric field created between the micropoints and the gates. Application to flat screens.

<CLAIMS>
Microtip display device, which has a first electrically insulating
substrate (2) carrying a cath
odoluminescent anode (4, 6) and a second
electrically insulating substrate (8) carrying, facing the first substrate:


a first series of parallel electrodes acting as cathode conductors
(10, 24) and carrying the electron emitter material microtips (16),
an electrically insulating layer (12) on said cathode conductors,
a second series of parallel electrodes serving as grids (14), placed on
said insulating layer (12) and forming an angle with the cathode conductors,

holes (17, 30) being formed in the insulating layer and the grids for the
passage of the microtips,

said device being characterized in that it also comprises on said grids, a
thin electrically insulating layer (20, 26) for limiting the electric

current liable to flow between the cathodoluminescent anode and the grids
and prevent the occurrence of an electric arc between said anode and said

grids, said thin layer also having holes facing the microtips, and in
that said thin electrically insulating layer is associated with means

preventing the disturbance, by said thin electrically insulating layer, of
the electric field created between the microtips and the grids.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the means preventing
the disturbance of the electric field comprise another thin layer or film

(28) covering said first insulating layer and which is sufficiently conductive
to permit the flow of interfering electric charges liable to be created

during the operation of the device and which also has holes facing the
microtips.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the diameter of the
holes formed in said thin insulating layer (26) exceeds the diameter of the

holes formed in the grids, in order to prevent the disturbance of the
electric field created between the microtips and the grids, said thin

insulating layer thus being overetched.
Device according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that
it also comprises a resistive layer (22) placed between each cathode 

conductor and the corresponding microtip (16), so that the latter rest on
said resistive layer.
Process for the production of the microtip display device, according to
claim 1, according to which said cathodoluminescent anode (4, 6) is formed

on the first substrate (2) and on the second substrate (8) are formed cathode
conductors (10, 24), said electrically insulating layer (12), a gate

layer (14) for the formation of the grids, the holes (17, 30) and then the
microtips (16), said process being characterized in that said thin electrically

insulating layer (20, 26) is also formed on the grid layer and in
that said thin electrically insulating layer is associated with means

preventing the disturbance, by said thin electrically insulating layer, of
the electric field created between the microtips and the grids.
Process according to claim 5, characterized in that said thin electrically
insulating layer (26) is formed before the holes.
Process according to claim 6, characterized in that on said thin,
electrically insulating layer (26), is also formed another thin layer (28),

which is sufficiently conductive to permit the flow of interfering
electric charges liable to be created during the operation of the device.
Process according to either of the claims 6 and 7, characterized in that
a protective layer is formed on the outermost thin layer produced on the

grids.
Process according to either of the claims 6 and 7, characterized in that
the layer or layers formed above the grids and which are resistive or conductive

are deposited after the formation of the holes.
