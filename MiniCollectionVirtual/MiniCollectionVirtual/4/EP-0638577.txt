<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a continuous or semi-continuous process for the preparation of N-substituted aminoalkylenephosphonic acid esters by reaction of an amine, a phosphoric acid diester and an aldehyde or ketone, which is characterised in that a liquid composition A containing as reactive components a primary and/or secondary amine of the formula I
