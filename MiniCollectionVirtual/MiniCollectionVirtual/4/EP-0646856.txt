<ABSTRACT>
An information retrieval device displays portions of a dynamically modifiable document 
requested by a user. The information retrieval device has a controller connected to a 

display screen, input selector switches, such as buttons, and memory, such as non-volatile 
flash memory. One or more documents, such as a newspaper or magazine, is stored in the 

memory. A receiver, such as a pager, modem, or FM radio receiver, is connected to and 
dynamically updates the memory. When the device is turned on, a first portion of a 

document is displayed on a display screen. When the user wants to see a different portion 
of the document, or a different document altogether, she presses one of the buttons. 

Upon detection that a button was enabled, an action is performed that changes the display 
on the display screen. The action performed can vary in complexity: it may simply cause 

the next page of the document to be displayed, or may execute a nested hypertext link to 
cause related information contained in the same or a different document to update only a 

portion of the display screen. The document is stored in the memory in a manner that 
allows the display screen to be refreshed directly from the memory. When an updated 

portion of a document is received by the receiver, that portion of memory is updated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to commonly assigned patent application Serial number EP-A-0646855
"Information Retrieval Device for Displaying a Document", filed on even date herewith,This invention relates to the data processing field. More particularly, this invention is an
information retrieval device specifically designed for displaying one or more documents in
an efficient, cost effective manner.General purpose personal computers have certainly had a revolutionary effect on the
modern world. Only a few short years ago, it was inconceivable that only a few thousand
dollars could buy an incredibly powerful machine capable of performing almost any
imaginable task performed in the workplace or home. In a single day, the same general
purpose personal computer could be instructed to calculate a complex mathematical
equation, compose a letter to a friend, do a regression cost analysis on a spreadsheet, send
a electronic mail message to the President of the United States, and instruct your toaster
to make you a piece of toast.While the general purpose computer is capable of doing just about everything, it has often
been criticized for not doing anything particularly well. Many people clearly do not want
to pay substantial sums of their hard earned money for a general purpose computer that
does thousands of things they don't want to do, but doesn't do a good job at what they do
want to do. This is particularly true in the area of information retrieval, where many
people would love to have a well designed, cost effective electronic alternative to hard
copy media such as newspapers, but don't want to pay thousands of dollars for a general
purpose computer that does, at best, a mediocre job of performing this task. In addition,
many information suppliers would love to provide rapidly changing information to a select 
group of consumers as they need it, when they need it, without the cumbersome
overhead of a general purpose computer.WO-A-9314458 describes a pocket organizer arranged to receive and display
image data, wherein the received image data are processed by converting the
images to a one-bit-per-pixel format suitable for display. A plurality of
input selector switches are provided, enabling a user to select
data to be displayed.GB-A-2 238 144 describes a data storage device arranged to receive data from a
separate input device and which comprises a memory and a display, the
arrangement being such that data stored in the memory can be displayed without
requiring the input device to be present.It would be

<CLAIMS>
An information retrieval device (20) for displaying a document, comprising:

a receiver (39) for receiving in pre-rendered format a document from a transmitter:
memory (30) for storing in pre-rendered format said document received by said receiver;
a plurality of input selector switches (50);
a display screen (40);
controller circuitry (60) connected to said memory, said input selector switches, and said
display screen, said controller circuitry determining which portion of said document to

display on said display screen, responsive to said plurality of input selector switches; and
said controller circuitry being arranged to refresh said display screen directly from that 
portion of said memory, in which
said portion of said document is stored.
The device of claim 1, wherein said plurality of input selector switches are displayed on
said display screen and selected by a mouse.
The device of claim 1, wherein said plurality of input selector switches are displayed on
said display screen and selected by a stylus.
The device of claim 1, wherein said plurality of input selector switches are displayed on
said display screen and selected by touch, said display screen being a touch display screen.
The device of claim 1, wherein said plurality of input selector switches are buttons.
The device of claim 1, said controller circuitry further comprising:

a microcontroller cell (65); 
an object register (62) for storing the states of a plurality of hypertext objects; and
a switch selection register (61) for storing the current switch status.
The device of claim 1, said controller circuitry further comprising:

an adder (71); and
an indirection register (73).
A method for generating and displaying a dynamically modifiable document on a display
screen (40), comprising the steps of:


receiving in pre-rendered format a document transmitted by a receiver (39);
storing said document in pre-rendered format in memory (30);
reading initial state data (31) from said memory;
determining a first display state from said initial state data;
displaying on said display screen a first portion of said document from a first document
portion of said memory corresponding to said first display state; and
refreshing said display screen directly from that portion of said memory in which said portion of
said document is stored.
The method of claim 8, further comprising the steps of:

monitoring a plurality of input selector switches (50);
responsive to said monitoring step, detecting that an input selector switch has been
enabled;
responsive to said detecting step, changing from said first display state to a second display
state; and
 
responsive to said changing step, displaying on said display screen a second portion of said

document from a second document portion of said memory corresponding to said second
display state.
The method of claim 9, further comprising:

receiving an updated portion of said document from said transmitter; and
storing said updated portion of said document in said memory.
