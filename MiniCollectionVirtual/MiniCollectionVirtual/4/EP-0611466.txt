<ABSTRACT>
A taut wire perimeter fence intrusion detection system (20) is disclosed. The taut wire deflection sensors (40) in the system each include a flexible housing (42) into which is disposed a full resistance bridge (64) having strain gages (64.0-64.3) for each leg. Opposing strain gages in the bridge circuit have predominant directions in common directions. The strain gages are formed directly onto a printed circuit board (65b). An amplifier circuit (70) is also mounted onto the circuit board, for amplifying the differential bridge voltage from the bridge. The taut wire (22) is connected to the housing, for example by way of a slotted bolt (44) and nut (45), so that horizontal deflection of the taut wire creates strain on the circuit board which is sensed by the strain gage bridge, amplified by the amplifier, and communicated to a data processing system (30) which generates the appropriate alarm condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A FULL BRIDGE STRAIN GAGE DEFLECTION SENSOR* * * * *This invention is in the field of intrusion detection, and is more specifically directed to taut wire deflection sensors.Background of the InventionRelatively large areas, such as multiple building campuses, airports and the like, are conventionally secured against undesired entry by way of fencing or other barriers around the perimeter of the secured area. Particularly where portions of the area are not subject to constant human surveillance, either directly by watchpersons or indirectly by camera, remote detection of intrusion or other breach of the perimeter allows deployment of the necessary security personnel as needed. In this way, effective asset protection can be efficiently maintained with relatively few security personnel.An example of a conventional remote intrusion detection system is the VT -300 electronic taut wire fence manufactured and sold by Vindicator Corporation. In this system, multiple taut wires make up a perimeter fence. Sensors are connected to the taut wires to sense their deflection, such as may result from an intruder climbing the fence, and to generate an electrical signal to a data processing system for communication of the appropriate alarm or alert condition to security personnel. The security personnel can then initiate the appropriate response to the detected condition. 

 In this prior system, a strain gage sensor consisting of a single resistive element is used to convert the mechanical motion of the taut wire deflection into an electrical signal. Referring now to Figures la through lc, an example of a conventional sensor, namely the model STW- 30 taut wire deflection sensor manufactured and sold by Vindicator Corporation, will now be described. This sensor includes a rubber cylindrical housing 2 having slotted bolt 4 mounted therewithin and extending therefrom; the taut wire is secured within slot 5 by a nut (not shown) . Housing 2 includes a rectangular cavity 7 into which strain gage assembly 6 is disposed in a cantilever fashion. Sealant 11 secures strain gage assembly 6 within cavity 7; adhesive seal 17 and sealant 11 together protect assembly 6 from moisture and other environmental effects. Housing 2 is mounted to plate 9, which can be mounted by way of bolts or screws to a fence post, wall, or to a sensor post which in turn is mounted to a fence post or wall.In this prior sensor, referring in particular to the cross-sectional view of Figure la, strain gage assembly 6 is implemented in the conventional manner
