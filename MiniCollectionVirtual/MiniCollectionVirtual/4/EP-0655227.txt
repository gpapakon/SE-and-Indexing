<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for producing dental prostheses, e.g. crowns, bridges, partial or complete dentures, comprising at least one metallic primary member (10) and a secondary member (20) which is likewise made of metal and is releasably fastened on the primary member, the primary member (10) and secondary member (20) having coupling elements (12, 24) of at least one attachment, which coupling elements fit into each other for mutual connection and which are arranged at a defined distance from one another, so that a defined intermediate space (30), in which a friction element (32) is fitted, is formed between the guide surfaces (18, 28) of the coupling elements (12, 24). The special feature of the invention resides in the fact that the coupling elements (12, 24) of the attachment are initially pre-processed during production of the primary member (10) and the secondary member (20) such that assembly of primary member (10) and secondary member (20) is generally possible only in the absence of the friction element, and that the guide surfaces (18, 28) of the coupling elements (12, 24) are subsequently conjointly re-processed by electrical erosion with an electrode in one operation, with positionally correct arrangement of the secondary member (20) on the primary member (10), in order to form the defined intermediate space (30), the dimensions of the electrode essentially corresponding to those of the friction element.
