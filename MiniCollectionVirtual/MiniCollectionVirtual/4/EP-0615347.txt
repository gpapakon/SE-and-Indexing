<ABSTRACT>
A receiver for compensating the deterioration of transmission characteristics, in which a transmission path estimation circuit 
(5) estimates the impulse response of the transmission path from the received signal. Bases upon the estimated impulse response, 

a switch (7) outputs selectively one of the outputs of an adaptative equalizing circuit (10) which adaptively equalize the 
received signal, and of a sign judging circuit (9) which is output only by judging the sign of the received signal. Then,
 a variable 
number-of-tap adaptive filter is used for the adaptive equalization of the received signal. Based on the estimated impulse response, 

the number-of-tap setting means controls the number of taps of the adaptive filter. Also, for the adaptive equalization of 
the received signal, there are used a transversal type matching filter, and a status estimation circuit which estimates the maximum 

likelihood of the transmission symbol string by the output from the matching filter. The number-of-tap setting means controls the 
number of statuses to be considered in accordance with the estimated impulse response.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adaptive
equalizing receiver and a maximum likelihood sequence
estimating (MLSE) receiver, in particular, to an apparatus
for compensating transmission characteristics deteriorated
by fading of frequency selectivity in high speed mobile
digital communications.In recent years, technologies that accomplish high
speed digital mobile communications have been studied. In
the high speed digital mobile communications, due to
multi-path transmission, frequency selectivity
occasionally fades, thereby remarkably deteriorating
transmission characteristics. In other words, when data
with a transmission of several hundred kbps or higher is
transmitted from a fixed station to a mobile station (such
as a car telephone), the mobile station receives indirect
waves reflected by mountains, buildings, and the like as
well as the direct wave. Thus, the shape of the wave
received by the mobile station differs from the shape of
the direct wave. As a result, the signal level of the 
received wave varies time by time. In addition, since the
car moves, the signal level varies corresponding to the
speed of the car. Depending on the speed of the car, the
frequency of the variation of the signal level changes.
Thus, since the signal level unregularly varies, if the
received wave that has been PSK (Phase Shift Keying)
modulated is affected by a multi-path transmission, an
erroneous code (signal) may be output.In this case, to compensate the error, the received
signal that has been deteriorated is compensated by an
adaptive equalizer or the like. A related art reference
about such an adaptive equalizer is described in for
example "Adaptive Equalization for TDMA Digital Mobile
Radio", IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, Vol.
40, No. 2, pp. 333 - 341, May, 1991.In addition, receivers provided with such an adaptive
equalizer have been developed. These receives have a
decision feedback equalizer, a linear equalizer, or the
like. Moreover, MLSE receivers are also known.Next, a decision feedback equalizer and a linear
equalizer, which are used in adaptive equalizing
receivers, will be described. The decision feedback
equalizer and the linear equalizer are constructed of a
transversal filter. Tap coefficients of the transversal
filter are set so that a multi-path wave (namely, a 
composite wave of a direct wave and delayed waves) is
equalized. In addition, tap coefficients are adaptively
updated corresponding to the condition of a transmission
line. As the delay time of delayed waves against a
