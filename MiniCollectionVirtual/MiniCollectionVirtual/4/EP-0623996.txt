<ABSTRACT>
A VLSI integrated circuit (100), which comprises a 
single IIR input and global section and identically-structured 

cascadable filter sections (FS), each of which filter sections 
includes a pair (102T, 102B) of time-multiplexed, real-coefficient, 

input-weighted FIR filter units and additional delay means, can be 
selectively programmed to operate in any one of a number of 

different filter configurations that can define real FIR or IIR 
filters, complex FIR or IIR filters, or filters which are various 

combinations thereof. One or more of such integrated circuits 
(100) are useful for implementing a digital deghosting and/or 

equalization filter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a reconfigurable programmable digital
filter structure.Modes of communicating information between a transmitter and
one or more receivers may be accomplished by terrestrial
broadcast, by satellite, and/or by cable. Such communicated
information includes analog NTSC television signals, digital
HDTV television signals and digital mobile telephone signals,
by way of examples. The received signal may be distorted
with respect to the transmitted signal due to multipath
effects or other signal transmission effects. As known,
such distortion may be minimized at the receiver by means of
a suitable equalization filter thereat. In particular, so-called
deghosting filters may be used as a multipath equalization
filter to minimize multipath distortion displayed by
a television receiver. One example of such deghosting filter,
which is implemented in digital form, is disclosed in
US-A-5 065 242 which issued to Dieterich et al. on November
11, 1991.
Proceedings of the IEEE 1990, Custom Integrated Circuits
Conference, 13-16 May 1990, Boston, M.M. Cai et al.,"A 40MHz
Programmable and Reconfigurable Filter Processor", pages
13.2.1-13.2.4, discloses a programmable digital filter with
reconfigurable architecture which is suitable for configuring
either as a single complex digital filter or as at least
one separate real digital filter.The specific filter characteristics of a deghosting filter
or other type of equalization filter of each individual
television set, mobile telephone, or other type of communication 
receiver incorporating such a filter preferably are
tailored to that particular receiver in order to be effective
in minimizing the distortion of the signal received
thereby. However, television sets and mobile telephones are
massed-produced items in which cost also must be minimized.
What is needed is a single integrated circuit (chip) architecture
which permits one or more of such chips to efficiently
and economically implement a reconfigurable programmable
digital filter having characteristics of a deghosting
filter or any other type of equalization filter that may be
separately tailored for use in each individual receiver of
any type of communication equipment.The invention is directed to a digital filter as defined in
claim 1.The filter comprises means including multiplexer means combined
with first and second input-weighted digital filter
units each of which has a given number of multiplier-coefficient
taps that provides a reconfigurable programmable
digital filter suitable for use as a
