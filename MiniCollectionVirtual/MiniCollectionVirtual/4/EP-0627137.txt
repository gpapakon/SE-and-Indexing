<ABSTRACT>
A clock is phase shifted by an amount controlled by the value of a control signal by establishing at least several discrete delay times to be imposed on the clock. The control signal value controls selection of the imposed discrete delay time. An analog-to-digital converter of a phase locked loop responds to intelligence representing variable phase bits and the selected phase shifted clock to control the signal value. The selected replica is derived by at least several cascaded substantially equal time delay units. In one embodiment, a multiplexer responds to the clock, and the signal value, which is Gray coded, to control connections from one of the delay units to an output terminal. In another embodiment, the number of cascaded delay units interposed between the clock and an output terminal is controlled by the signal value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to signal
controlled phase shifters and more particularly to a
phase shifter including at least several delay elements
having connections to an output terminal controlled in
response to the value of a control signal.The invention is also related to a signal
multiplexer responsive to at least several signals and
more particularly to such a multiplexer which is
responsive to a reflected coded signal.Signal controlled phase shifters are usually
analog devices including a variable reactance, such as
a varactor, having a value controlled by the amplitude
of a voltage. Such phase shifters are frequently
employed in voltage controlled variable frequency
oscillators, such as are employed in phase locked
loops. In such applications, a fixed clock is supplied
to the voltage controlled, variable frequency
oscillator to derive an output frequency that is fed
back to one input of a phase detector, having a second
input responsive to an input frequency. The phase
detector derives an error voltage that is fed to a loop
filter which supplies the voltage controlled oscillator
with a variable amplitude voltage for controlling the
oscillator output frequency. Phase locked loops are 
used to lock a receiver to an incoming frequency with
zero frequency or phase error. In receivers responsive
to variable phase signals representing digital data,
e.g. QPSK or BPSK signals, a demodulator of the
receiver is locked to a symbol frequency with zero
phase error. Such locking is usually performed with a
first or second order phase locked loop.The prior art analog phase shifters and analog
based phase locked loops have the usual disadvantages
associated with analog circuitry, i.e., lack of
repetitiveness in manufacturing and performance unless
"tweaking" procedures are used, low yield production,
inaccuracy and the need to adapt the analog circuitry
to the remaining parts of the equipment. To overcome
these problems, digitally based phase locked loops have
been developed. One digitally based phase locked loop
responsive to base band signals to be demodulated
includes an analog-to-digital converter having one
input responsive to such a signal. The converter has a
second input responsive to a sampling clock having a
variable frequency controlled by the digital phase
locked loop. The converter derives a multi-bit digital
output signal having a variable value dependent on the
amplitude of the base band signal when a sample derived
by the clock occurs. The base band signal is subject
to a full gamut
