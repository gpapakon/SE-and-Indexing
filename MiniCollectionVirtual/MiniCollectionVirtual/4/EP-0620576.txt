<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electrical main switch (10) having a housing (12), having a switching mechanism (14) for operating at least one contact point (16), having a locking device (18) for inhibiting the switching mechanism (14), which locking device (18) has a blocking part (20) which can pivot and can be pivoted by means of a locking apparatus which acts in a positively locking manner, preferably a hexagonal hollow-socket key, which locking apparatus can be inserted through an access opening (13) in the housing (12) into a retaining opening (22) which is provided on the blocking part (20) and is accessible from the outside, for positively locking engagement, which retaining opening (22) is provided with a central blocking pin (24), the central blocking pin (24) being mounted in a pendulum manner by means of a spring (26) which is inserted into the retaining opening (22), and which central blocking pin (24) deflects if acted on eccentrically, the base of the retaining opening (22) being provided with a central recess (25) into which the blocking pin (24), on which the provided locking apparatus acts centrally, engages and releases a region (23) (which is intended to produce the positively locking engagement) of the retaining opening (22) before engagement of the locking apparatus.

Electric main switch (10) having a housing (12), 
having a switching mechanism (14) and a hand-operated 

switching lever (15) for actuating at least one contact 
point (16), having an interlocking facility (18) for 

blocking the switching mechanism (14), which interlocking 
facility (18) has a pivotable blocking part (20) which 

can be pivoted by means of an interlocking device, 
preferably a hexagonal hollow socket spanner, which acts 

in a positively locking manner and can be introduced into 
a receiving opening (22) for positive-locking engagement, 

which receiving opening is accessible from the outside 
through an access opening (13) in the housing (12), is 

provided on the blocking part (20) and is provided with 
a central blocking pin (24), characterized in that the 

central blocking pin (24) is mounted such that it can 
swing by means of a spring (26) situated in the receiving 

opening (22) and deflects when acted on eccentrically, in 
that a central recess (25) is arranged on the bottom of 

the receiving opening (22), into which recess the blocking 
pin (24), which is acted on by the intended interlocking 

device, engages and clears a region (23), provided 
for positive-locking engagement, of the receiving 

opening (22) for the interlocking device, for the engagement 
of the interlocking device. 
Electric main switch according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the blocking pin (24) has a peripheral 

collar (28) which cooperates with the spring (26). 
Electric main switch according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the spring (26) has a soft characteristic.  

 
Electric main switch according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that a diametrical 

transverse web (30) is integrally formed on the blocking 
pin (24) and serves as a support for the spring (26). 
Electric main switch according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the diametrical transverse web has 

a semicircular cross-section and bears with its curved 
side on the spring (26). 
Electric main switch according to either of 
Claims 4 and 5, characterized in that the ends of the 

diametrical transverse web (30) are guided in longitudinal 
grooves which are formed in a diametrically opposite 

manner in the receiving opening (22) of the blocking part 
(20). 
Electric main switch according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that that end of the 

blocking pin (24) which points outwards is curved like a 
dome. 
Electric main switch according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that that end of the 

blocking pin (24) which points inwards has an end face 
which is bent off with a sharp edge at right angles with 

respect to the longitudinal axis of the blocking pin. 
Electric main switch according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the recess (25) 

which is arranged on the bottom of the recess (22) in the 
blocking part (20) is matched with close tolerance to the 

external diameter of the blocking pin (24). 
Electric main switch according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the blocking part 

(20) is deliberately stiff to pivot.
