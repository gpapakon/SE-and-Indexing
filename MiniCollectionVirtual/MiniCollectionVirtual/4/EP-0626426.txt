<ABSTRACT>
Described herein is a room-temperature-curable 
organopolysiloxane composition that cures at 

room temperature to give a rubber whose surface is 
easily coated with paint and from which the resulting 

paint film does not delaminate readily and that after 
curing is free from surface staining of the rubber or 

adjacent substrates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a room-temperature-curable
organopolysiloxane composition that
cures into a rubber whose surface is easily coated with
paint to yield a delamination-resistant paint film.
After curing, the rubber of
adjacent
substrate
surprisingly will not be stained.Organopolysiloxane compositions that cure at
room temperature to form rubber are used in a wide
range of applications as sealants, electrical
insulating materials, adhesives, moldmaking materials,
and so forth. One example is comprised of compositions
prepared from silanol-endblocked organopolysiloxane
plus crosslinker that contains silicon-bonded
hydrolyzable groups (JP-A 48-15962 and JP-A 49-2853).However, these compositions exhibit a poor
paint coatability, and the application of paint to the
surface of the cured rubber is highly problematic. In
addition, after curing, staining gradually occurs on
the surface of the rubber and on substrates adjacent to
the rubber. A room-temperature-curable
organopolysiloxane composition containing amino-functional
alcohol has been proposed with the goal of
improving the paint coatability in JP-A 58-215453.
while this composition does exhibit good paint
coatability, the adherence is unsatisfactory and
ultimately results in delamination or peeling of the
paint film. To eliminate the staining problem of cured
rubber surfaces and adjacent substrates, we have
proposed room-temperature-curable organopolysiloxane
compositions that containing a drying oil JP-A 62-1750
and JP-A 62-7763. These compositions exhibit excellent
anti-staining properties, but the drying oil can
separate during storage and the cured rubber surface
may still become discolored. EP-A-0 175 477 discloses an organopolysiloxane composition
comprising a paintability compound with hydrolyzable groups.In US-A 4,978,363, a reaction product of an
organopoly-siloxane is described having at least one
amino-substituted hydrocarbon radical bonded to a
silicon atom and a higher
fatty
carboxylic acid. The
carboxylic acids can be either saturated or
unsaturated. The reaction products are used as a
fiber-treatment agent that does not gel during use.The present invention introduces a room-temperature-curable
organopolysiloxane composition that
cures into a rubber whose surface is easily coated with
paint to yield a delamination-resistant paint film,
that after curing is free of soiling or staining of the
surface of the rubber or adjacent substrate, and that
is particularly useful as a sealant.The present invention provides a
