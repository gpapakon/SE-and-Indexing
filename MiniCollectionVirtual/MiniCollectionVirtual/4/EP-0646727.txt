<ABSTRACT>
A fuel pump has a motor (14) which rotates a shaft 
(16) with an impeller (18) fitted thereon for pumping fuel 

within a pumping chamber (26) comprised of semi-elliptically 
shaped flow channels (40) formed in a pump cover (30) and a 

pump bottom (20) which encase the impeller (18). Primary 
vortices (42) developed by the rotary pumping action of the 

impeller (18) closely approximate the shape of the pumping 
chamber (26) thus minimising secondary counter flowing 

vortices with their attendant decrease in pump efficiency. 
An alternative design is the special case of an ellipse 

where the major axis and the minor axis of the ellipse have 
equal lengths such that the pumping chamber has semi-circular 

shaped flow channels.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to automotive fuel pumps, and, 
more particularly, to a regenerative turbine fuel pump 
having a pumping chamber which optimally forms primary flow 
vortices and reduces secondary vortices. Regenerative turbine fuel pumps for automobiles 
typically operate by having a rotary element, for example an 
impeller, mounted on a motor shaft within a pump housing. A 
pumping chamber around the outer circumference of the rotary 
element is formed of two halves: a cover channel in the pump 
cover and a bottom channel in the pump bottom. Fuel is 
drawn into a fuel inlet, located at the beginning of the 
cover channel and axially across from the beginning of the 
bottom channel, and flows to either the cover channel or the 
bottom channel. Primary vortices are formed within each 
channel of the chamber by the pumping action of the rotary 
element and are propelled to the ends of each channel before 
being expelled through the fuel outlet, which is located at 
the end of the bottom channel. Pumping losses occur when 
secondary vortices develop in those areas of the flow 
channels which do not conform to the shape of primary 
vortices. The geometric shape of the flow channels 
comprising the pumping chamber thus becomes important in 
minimising formation of secondary vortices. As shown in Figure 6, conventional prior art flow 
channels 80 have a flat-sided section 81 with rounded 
corners 88. 
In such flow channels, secondary vortices 84 
develop near corners 88 since primary vortices 82 do not 
conform to the shape of flow channel 80. The secondary 
vortices 84 flow counter to primary vortices 82 thus 
decreasing pump efficiency by slowing fuel travel through 
pumping chamber 66. An alternative design, shown in Figure 
9, employs flattened corners 86 which yield trapezoidal  
 
shaped flow channels 90 of pumping chamber 66. 
The patent document WO-A-92/00457 discloses a fuel pump for 
feeding fuel from a fuel tank to the internal combustion 
engine of a motor vehicle. The pump has an impeller rotating 
in a pump chamber including flow channels on either side of 
the impeller. Each flow channel has a cross-section which is 
a segment of a circle and is arranged to have a centre of 
curvature which is shared with the centre of curvature of 
the blades of the impeller.  
 An object of the present invention is to overcome the 
disadvantages of prior fuel flow channel designs by 
providing part-elliptically shaped channels in a pump cover 
and a pump bottom which interact with a pump impeller to 
fo
