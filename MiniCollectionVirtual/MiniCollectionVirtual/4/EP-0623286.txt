<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for moulding chocolate mass or the like, having a multiplicity of pistons 3 which are all moved together and in this arrangement, controlled via a control slide valve 7', take in chocolate mass, in the intake stroke, from a supply and, in the ejection stroke, feed said chocolate mass to a die plate 10'. Not all the pistons are provided with an outlet die in the die plate 10'. The object of the invention is to present as simple a way as possible for returning into the supply container the chocolate mass which has not been advanced to an outlet die 11. The essence of the solution of the object according to the invention lies in utilising the control slide valve 7' itself as the supply container. It is thus possible, as demonstrated in Figure 11 using the second piston from the left as an example, to return the chocolate mass into the control slide valve 7' over the path shown by an arrow by way of just a small number of return ducts 20 and 21 in the bottom plate 13' of the control slide valve 7' and/or of the slide-valve-chamber base 8', said openings corresponding with short return ducts 19 in the die plate 10'.
