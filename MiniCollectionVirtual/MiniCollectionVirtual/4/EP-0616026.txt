<ABSTRACT>
Stable and clear concentrated cleaning compositions are 
disclosed which comprise at least one long chain 

surfactant, and which are stabilized by the additional 
presence of short chain surfactants. The short chain 

surfactants further boost grease cleaning performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to concentrated cleaning 
compositions. Although the present invention relates 
primarily to cleaning compositions for hard surfaces, it 
may also be of interest for other cleaning compositions 
including dishwashing and laundry detergent compositions. Concentrated cleaning compositions are well known in the 
art. Concentrated compositions are mainly characterized by 
the fact that they comprise a higher concentration of 
active ingredients compared to a conventional cleaning  
 
composition, and a problem which is typically encountered 
when formulating concentrated cleaning compositions is 
therefore the physical stability of such compositions. 
Indeed, because such compositions comprise a high amount of 
active ingredients in a limited amount of water, stability 
problems appear which lead, if not solved, to compositions 
which separate into several phases. This phenomenon 
affects the performance of the composition and is visually 
noticeable, thereby rendering such formulations unfit for 
commercialization. Various solutions have been proposed to solve this problem 
which typically involve the use of specific stabilizing 
ingredients, or hydrotropes. Such ingredients have the 
sole function of stabilizing the composition. They thus 
increase the cost of formulating such compositions without 
providing any cleaning performance benefits, and they 
furthermore require to free up parts in the formulation 
which could otherwise be used to formulate more actives. For instance, EP 316 726 discloses concentrated 
compositions in the form of microemulsions which comprise 
water, perfume, a surfactant and a so-called co-surfactant. 
The co-surfactant is said to reduce the interfacial tension 
at interfaces between dispersed and continuous phases of an 
emulsion of said surfactant, thereby creating a stable 
microemulsion. The so-called co-surfactants in the '726 
publication are listed as specific glycol ethers, which are 
traditionally regarded as solvents in this field, or 
specific carboxylic acids. The co-surfactants in the '726 
publication do not appear to participate to the overall 
cleaning performance of the product. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
formulate a stable concentrated cleaning composition 
without using ingredients which are provided for the sole 
purpose of providing stability to the compositions herein,  
 
but which also participate significantly to the cleaning 
performance of said compositions. It has now been found that this
