<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rubber composition for sponge 
rubber. More particularly, the invention relates to a non-halogen 
flameproof rubber composition for sponge rubber 
which has good heat resistance, good oil resistance, high-foaming 
property and good shape-retention. As ethylene-acrylate rubber is used for sponge rubber 
insulator of elelctric products, it is demanded to have good 
heat resistance, good oil resistance, high-foaming property 
and good flameproof. As a method for improving flameproof property of rubber 
compositions, addition of magnesium hydroxide or aluminium 
hydroxide to the rubber compositions has been known. 
However, the addition of a non-halogen flame retardant such 
as magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide to a 
ethylene-acrylate rubber reduces the shape-retention of the 
rubber: that is, the interaction between the ethylene-acrylate 
rubber and the non-halogen flame retardants becomes 
weak, therefore the viscosity of the compound decreases a nd, 
as a result, the compound deforms during the vulcanization. Therefore, it is desired to develop rubber compositions 
which have good heat resistance, good oil resistance, high-foaming 
property and good shape-retention. Under the circumstances, the inventors made an extensive 
study, seeking a rubber composition which retains a good  
 
shape-retention even if a non-halogen flame retardant is 
added, and found that a rubber composition for a sponge 
rubber which has good flameproof and good shape-retention 
can be obtained when a carboxylic acid- or carboxylic 
anhydride-containing ethylene copolymer and a particular 
hydroxide(s) are added to an epoxy-group containing acryl 
elastomer. Thus the invention provides a rubber composition for 
sponge rubber which comprises the following components (A) 
∼ (E) and satisfies the following requirements that the 
ratio by weight of (A)/(B) is 30/70∼99/1 and the amount of 
component (C) is 50∼400 parts by weight per 100 parts by 
weight of the total amount of components (A) and (B) : 
(A): Epoxy group-containing acryl elastomer. (B): Ethylene copolymer which contains a carboxyl 
group(s) or a carboxylic anhydride group(s). (C): Hydroxide of II or III group of typical 
metal element in periodic table. (D): Vulcanizer. (E): Foaming agent. The invention is illustrated in detail as follow. The epoxy group-cotaining acryl elastomer, the component 
(A) is an elastomer made by the copolymerization of epoxy 
group-containing monomer (as cross-linking points) with at 
least one acryl
