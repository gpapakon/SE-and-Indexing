<ABSTRACT>
A molten metal pouring pot 12 stores molten metal 1, 
and pours the molten metal 1 through a molten metal outlet 15 

when it is tilted. A housing 13 is constituted by a 
nonmagnetic material. To compensate for the temperature drop 

of the molten metal 1, a planar induction coil 32 of an 
induction heater 31 which is independently separated from the 

molten metal pouring pot 12 is disposed so as to be opposite 
through a gap to the molten metal 1. The molten metal pouring 

pot 12 and the induction heater 31 are shaped and located so 
that the inner circumference of the molten metal pouring pot 12 

and the outer circumference of the induction heater 31 do not 
interfere with each other when the molten metal pouring pot 12 

is tilted. A yoke 33 is disposed on the back of the induction 
coil 32, and driven by a commercial frequency. Preferably, an 

elevator 34 is provided. The molten metal pouring pot 12 is 
tilted by a tiltable roller conveyor 16b. The center of 

tilting is on a pin 17 near the molten metal outlet 15.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a molten metal pouring
pot used when molten metal of conductive metal such as cast
iron received from a melting furnace or the like into the
molten metal pouring pot is poured into molds or the like, and
particularly to a molten metal pouring pot with an induction
heater.A molten metal pouring pot is directed to a vessel for
storing, carrying and pouring high-temperature molten metal.
The housing of the molten metal pouring pot is constituted by
a structural steel plate in order to support the weight of the
molten metal, and the inner surface thereof is covered with a
refractory material so as to be proof against the heat of the
molten metal. A molten metal outlet is formed at a place near
an upper portion of the molten metal pouring pot so as to
facilitate pouring of the molten metal into molds.The metal which is molten in a melting furnace is put
into a molten metal pouring pot, and then carried by a carrying
means such as a crane, a hoist or the like to a place where
molds are prepared. At that place, the molten metal is poured
into a plurality of molds out of the molten metal pouring pot.
Generally, about 10 to 40 molds are be filled at one time with 
molten metal stored in one molten metal pouring pot. It takes
10 to 30 minutes from reception of molten metal into a molten
metal pouring pot from a melting furnace till completion of
pouring of the molten metal into molds. Meanwhile the
temperature of the molten metal goes on dropping so that
sometimes it becomes lower than the lowest temperature required
for casting to thereby result in defective cast goods. In
order to prevent defective goods from being produced, the work
of pouring of the molten metal is brought into an end when the
temperature of the molten metal becomes lower than the lowest
temperature required for casting, even if the molten metal
still remains in the molten metal pouring pot. The molten
metal remaining in the molten metal pouring pot must be
returned into the melting furnace to raise the temperature, and
then put into the molten metal pouring pot again so as to be
poured into molds. This is a vain work.In order to eliminate such a vain work of returning
temperature-dropped molten metal into a melting furnace again,
there is a case where such temperature drop of molten metal is
estimated in advance so that the molten metal is heated
excessively. In this case, however, a wasteful energy is
required for heating molten metal excessively.In order to solve such a problem that a vain work is
carried
