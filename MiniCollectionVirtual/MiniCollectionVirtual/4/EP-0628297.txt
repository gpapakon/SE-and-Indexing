<ABSTRACT>
The tubular stocking is cut away (2) at the patella (3), and a curved rigid plastic component (5) is slid into a front pocket (4). This is shaped to fit round the shinbone, and is cut away (2) at the top for the patella. Its lateral portion is higher than its medial one. At the patella it can be cut away along a curve from the medial to the lateral portion. An elastic strip (6) enclosing the stocking can have quick-action fasteners (7), by which it is secured to the stocking and held in the engaged position.
