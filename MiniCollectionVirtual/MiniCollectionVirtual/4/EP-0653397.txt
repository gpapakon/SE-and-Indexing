<ABSTRACT>
Isoparaffins and olefins are alkylated in the liquid phase by 
contact with a solid superacid such as sulfated zirconia containing 

heteropolyacids or polyoxoanions. High octane number blending 
components for motor fuel and other valuable products are obtained, with 

important advantages over processes using liquid acid catalysts, and 
over vapor phase alkylation with solid superacid catalysts.

<DESCRIPTION>
Alkylation as referred to herein is the reaction of paraffins 
with olefins to produce a mixture of highly branched paraffins called 
alkylate. The major use of the alkylation process is to produce 
alkylate for gasoline blends. At present, the only alkylation processes 
of commercial interest use sulfuric acid or hydrofluoric acid as 
catalysts. These catalysts are currently used because they are more 
competitive with respect to economics and alkylate quality than any 
other catalyst system developed to this date. Use of sulfuric acid and hydrofluoric acid as catalysts for 
alkylation, however, is fraught with safety and environmental problems. 
The feedstocks, products, and catalysts are liquids and require 
substantial processing equipment to separate them. Further, the 
catalysts are corrosive and toxic and must be handled with great 
care to contain and to regenerate or dispose of them. Solid superacid catalysts have been proposed for use as alkylation 
catalysts. See for example Hollstein et al U. S. Patents Nos. 4,918,041 
and 4,956,519 issued May 25, 1993 and September 11, 1990 respectively, 
disclosing solid superacid catalysts useful in alkylation and other 
reactions comprising a sulfated calcined metal oxide or hydroxide of 
Group III or Group IV, e.g. zirconium; metal oxide or hydroxide of Group 
V, Group VI or Group VII; e.g. manganese, metal oxide or hydroxide of 
Group VIII, e.g. iron. See also Angstadt et al U. S. Patent 5,212,136 
issued May 18, 1993, disclosing solid superacid catalysts useful as  
 
alkylation catalysts comprising sulfated and calcined mixtures of a 
support comprising an oxide or hydroxide of a Group IV-A element, an 
oxide or hydroxide of molybdenum and an oxide or hydroxide of a Group I-B, 
II-B, III-A, III-B, IV-B, V-A or VI-A metal other than molybdenum, or 
a metal of the Lanthanide Series of the Periodic Table. See also 
Angstadt et al U. S. Patent 5, 214,017 issued May 25, 1993, disclosing 
solid superacid catalysts useful as alkylation catalysts, comprising 
sulfated and calcined mixtures of a support comprising an oxide or 
hydroxide of a Group IV-A element, an oxide or hydroxide of Group VI, 
VII or VIII metal, an oxide or hydroxide of a Group I-B, II-B, III-A, 
III-3, IV-B, V-A or VI-A metal and an oxide or hydroxide of a metal of 
the Lanthanide Series of the Periodic Table. Other disclosures of solid superacids useful in alkylation 
processes are contained in:

partially in liquid phase, contacting said feedstock and catalyst under 
alkylation conditions, removing a mixture of unreacted feedstock and 

alkylation products from said reactor, flashing gases from said mixture 
to obtain gaseous overhead and liquid alkylate residue, compressing and 

liquefying said gaseous overhead to obtain liquefied gases, mixing said 
liquefied gases and said liquid alkylate residue to obtain a 

deisobutanizer feed, distilling isobutane from said deisobutanizer feed
