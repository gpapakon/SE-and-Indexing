<CLAIMS>
A supporting and mounting device for a resilient 
bearing el
ement of a machine cast in a concrete foundation 
as an embedded unit, characterised in that the embedded unit 

comprises a plurality of spaced apart bars (12) and plates 
(13) which are disposed side by side and are aligned 

parallel to the surface of the concrete foundation, which 
are connected to one another to form damping joints (14) 

which are disposed between the surfaces of the parts and 
which during casting are filled with concrete material. 
An embedded unit according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the embedded unit comprises a grid of 

individual bars (12) having threaded holes (15) for securing 
the resilient bearing element, between which bars there are 

arranged plates (13) projecting into the concrete material 
(11), wherein the surfaces of the bars associated with the 

bearing element and the side edges of the plates lie in one 
plane (18) with the surface of the concrete foundation. 
An embedded unit according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the embedded unit has individual bars 

(12) with the threaded holes (15) for securing the resilient 
bearing element, which bars are disposed transversely to a 

plurality of plates (13) projecting into the concrete 
material (11) and are connected in a form-locking manner 

therewith, wherein the surfaces of the bars associated with 
the bearing element and the side edges of the plates lie in 

one plane (18) with the surface of the concrete foundation. 
An embedded unit according to Claims 2 and 3, 
characterised in that the plates (13) are U-shaped and the 

two arms (17) project into the concrete material (11).  
 
An embedded unit according to Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the bars (12) and plates (13) are 

assembled by means of discontinuous weld seams (16) and spot 
welds to form the damping joints (14) between the juxtaposed 

surfaces. 
An embedded unit according to Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the plurality of bars (12) and plates 

(13) are clamped together by threaded bolts (19,22) to form 
the damping joints (14). 
An embedded unit according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that the damping joints (14) are formed by 

shims (20).
