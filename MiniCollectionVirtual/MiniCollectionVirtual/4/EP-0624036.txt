<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image coding 
and decoding device, and more particularly to an image 
coding and decoding device which can efficiently code 
and decode the motion image signals so as to transmit 
and record the signals by the interframe coding. FIG. 3 is a block diagram which shows a 
transmitting section of an image coding transmitter in 
the prior art. In FIG. 3, numeral 2 designates a motion 
compensating circuit, numeral 6 designates a differential 
section, numeral 8 designates a coding and decoding 
circuit, numeral 11 designates an adder, and numeral 13 
designates a frame memory. FIG. 4 is a block diagram which shows a motion 
vector detecting section in the motion compensating 
circuit 2. In FIG. 4, numeral 14 designates a 
differential section, numeral 16 designates a distortion 
operator, and numeral 18 designates a comparator. The operation of the device will be described. In the motion compensating circuit 2, using 
digitally transformed input signals 1 and previous frame 
reconstruction signals 3 stored in the frame memory 13, 
with the picture element blocks of the prescribed size  
 
N₁ x N₂ (N₁, N₂ being plus integers) used as a unit, a 
block which has the most similar pattern to the block of 
the input signal is detected from the previous signals, 
and signals of the detected block are outputted as 
predicting signals 4, and index information 5 indicating 
motion vectors being position shift between the position 
of the block and that of the input signal block is 
transmitted to the receiving side. An example of the motion detecting method is shown 
in FIG. 4. Assuming that the input signal block be S(1), the 
previous frame signal block be S'i(3), the number of the 
searched blocks be L (L being plus integer), the matching 
distortion between the blocks be di(17), and K = N₁ x N₂.

S = (S₁, ..., SK), S'i = (S'i1, ..., S'iK), i = 1 ∼ L 


 
Among di(11) estimated by the differential section 17 
and the distortion operator 16 based on the above 
formulas, the block having the smallest matching 
distortion value is detected by the comparator 18, and 
the block signal is transformed into the predicting signal 
4 block by block, and the index information 5 of the 
block motion vectors is outputted. However, in FIG. 4, 
the hardware composition is simplified by applying the 
serial process to the distortion operation and the  
 
comparing process at each searching block. In FIG. 5, 
an example of the arrangement of the searching vectors 
is shown. Differences between
