<ABSTRACT>
A passive electrical transponder (20) may be encoded with a code corresponding to medical information, and the transponder (20) directly transplanted in a patient's underarm area (22). The information may then be accessed with an electromagnetic hand held reader (26) which is brought into proximity of the transponder (20). The medical information may itself be directly encoded into the transponder (20), or a code used which is then keyed to a corresponding data entry in a data bank (30) accessible over telecommunication lines (32). With this invention, medical information may be reliably recorded, maintained, and accessed with minimal patient involvement in order to achieve a high degree of reliability and accuracy.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MEDICAL INFORMATION TRANSPONDER IMPLANT Background and Summary of the InventionOver the years, there have been many devices proposed for use in recording and associating medical information with an individual. Most commonly, this medical information includes the basic information neces¬ sary for emergency treatment such as blood type, allergic drug reactions, closest relative, any on-going medica¬ tions, and other similar kinds of data. In the prior art, various kinds of fill-in-the-blank cards, tags, labels and the like are available for use. These may stored in a wallet, worn as a bracelet or necklace, asso¬ ciated with a shoe or other article of clothing, or oth¬ erwise associated or attached to an individual. These prior art devices have met with limited success, for various reasons.One drawback encountered with these prior art devices is the limited amount of information which may be conveniently recorded and carried. Secondly, the infor¬ mation is typically recorded by the individual himself and is therefore subject to mistake and/or error due to the fact that the individual is rarely medically trained. 

Therefore, the medical information must first be obtained from a doctor or other trained medical personnel and errors may develop through merely communicating this information to the individual. For the same reason, not all of the more pertinent information may be recorded as it may not be known or appreciated by the individual. Similarly, updating the information occurs only haphaz¬ ardly, subject to the whim of the individual. There may also be problems encountered in retrieving this informa- tion at the time of its need. The location of the data must first be ascertained, and then the data correctly read from the card or other means used to record the data. Unhappily, an individual's own handwriting may be sufficiently bad to prevent the reading of data even after location of the data card. Additionally, the data entry on the card may have been obliterated or otherwise obscured. All of these difficulties represent drawbacks in the various approaches in the prior art which have limited the widespread adoption and use of these prior art devices.The inventors herein are also aware of a passive electrical transponder which has been used in the prior art to mark or identify inventory items and even live¬ stock with an identifying number or code for inventory purposes. The passive electrical transponder is quite small, generally comprising a cylinder 2 mm in diameter by 11 mm in length, and its

<CLAIMS>
What Is Claimed Is:
1. A medical information storage device for hu¬ mans, said device comprising an implantable transponder, said transponder having means for being encoded with a code corresponding to said medical information associated with a particular human, said transponder being adapted for convenient retrieval of said code after implantation in the human to which said medical information is associ¬ ated.
2. The device of Claim 1 wherein said transponder is adapted for retrieval by non-invasive means.
3. The device of Claim 2 wherein said non-invasive means comprises an electromagnetic reader.
4. The device of Claim 3 wherein said electromag¬ netic reader has means for encoding said transponder.
5. The device of Claim 3 wherein said transponder is passive and thereby does not include a source of elec¬ trical power.
6. The device of Claim 5 wherein said transponder is a cylinder approximately 2 mm in diameter and approxi¬ mately 11 mm in length.
7. The device of Claim 6 wherein said transponder is adapted for implantation under said human's underarm.
8. The device of Claim 1 wherein said code is a unique tag, said unique tag being associated with an entry in an external data base, said data base being thereby external to said transponder and containing said medical information in alterable form.
9. The device of Claim 1 wherein said code is directly translatable into said medical information.
10. The device of Claim 1 wherein said code is a 64 bit binary number.
11. A medical information storage device for hu¬ mans, said device comprising an implantable transponder, said transponder having means for being encoded with a code, said code corresponding to a data entry in a remote 


data bank, said data entry comprising said medical infor¬ mation, and an electromagnetic reader for accessing said transponder to read said code.
12. The device of Claim 11 wherein said electromag¬ netic reader comprises a hand held reader including means for accessing said code contained within said transponder in a non-invasive manner.
13. The device of Claim 12 wherein said electromag¬ netic reader has means for encoding said transponder.
14. The device of Claim 12 wherein said transponder is passive.
15. The device of Claim 14 wherein said transponder is a cylinder approximately 2 mm in diameter and approxi¬ mately 11 mm in length.
16. A medical information storage device for hu¬ mans, said device comprising an implantable transponder, said transponder having means for being encoded with a plurality of data comprising medical information associ- ated with a particular human, and an electromagnetic reader for accessing said encoded medical information to directly read said data from said transponder.
17. The device of Claim 16 wherein said electromag¬ netic reader includes means for accessing said encoded data in a non-invasive manner.
18. The device of Claim 17 wherein said transponder is passive.
19. The device of Claim 18 wherein said transponder is a cylinder approximately 2 mm in diameter and approxi¬ mately 11 mm in length.
20. The device of Claim 16 wherein said electromag¬ netic reader has means for encoding said transponder.
