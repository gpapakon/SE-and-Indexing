<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to carbon-containing 
glass which may be used alone or as a matrix 
material reinforced with fibers. In USSN 002,049 
corresponding to GB-A-2266300 to 2266304 
a ceramic composition 
designated "black glass" is disclosed which has an 
empirical formula SiCxOy where x ranges from 0.5 to 
2.0 and y ranges from 0.5 to 3.0, 
preferably x ranges from 0.9 to 1.6 and y ranges from 
0.7 - 1.8. That ceramic material has a higher carbon 
content than prior art materials and is very resistant 
to high temperatures - up to 1400°C. It is 
produced by reacting in the presence of a 
hydrosilylation catalyst a cyclosiloxane having a vinyl 
group with a cyclosiloxane having a hydrogen group to 
form a polymer precursor, which is subsequently 
pyrolyzed in an inert atmosphere to yield black glass. 
The present invention involves a new method of 
pyrolyzing such black glass precursors. In co-pending application U.S. Ser. No. 
07/586,632 
(now US-A-5231059), 
it is shown that by including oxygen during 
the pyrolysis that the carbon content of the black 
glass can be adjusted to a lower value useful for 
certain purposes. We have now found that if the 
pyrolysis step is carried out rapidly enough that the 
effect of oxygen can be overcome and black glass having 
a high carbon content can be achieved, even if 
pyrolyzed in the presence of air.  
 FR-A-2647777 discloses a glass composition which maintains its stability at 
temperatures of up to at least 1650°C, comprising silicon, oxygen, and carbon 
distributed in polyatomic groupings comprising 34-48 wt. % of tetraoxysilicon 
groups, 11-29 wt. % of monocarbosiloxane groups, 11-27 wt. % of 
dicarbosiloxane groups, up to 22 wt. % of tetracarbosilicon groups, and 3-9 
wt. % of elemental carbon dispersed in the glass matrix. The glass composition of FR-A-2647777 is obtained by pyrolysis of a 
methylsilicone precursor in a non-oxidizing atmosphere, until there is no further 
loss of weight.  
 A carbon-containing black glass ceramic 
composition having the empirical formula SiCxOy where 
x is greater than zero and up to 2.0, preferably 
up to 1.6, and y is greater than zero and up to 
2.2, preferably up to 1.8, is produced by 
pyrolyzing certain polymer precursors at a rate 
exceeding 5°C/min, preferably 50°C/min to 1000°C/min, 
most preferably above 100°C/min in the presence of 
oxygen, preferably in air. The black glass ceramic composition is the 
pyrolyzed reaction product of a polymer prepared from 
(1) a cyclosiloxane monomer having the
