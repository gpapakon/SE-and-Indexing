<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid level
sensor circuit for sensing a surface of a liquid in a
container according to claim 1 and a method for detecting
a probe touching a surface of a liquid according to claim
8.DE-A-28 32 630 describes a liquid level sensor
comprising a probe, an oscillator, a comparator and
controller. No RC filter is disclosed to servo the first
output signal of the oscillator circuit.WO-A-88/10412 describes a probe, an oscillator
and a comparator. The comparator is monitoring the output
of a differentiator, which responds to changes sensed by
a frequency/phase detector. This detector has feedback
control to the oscillator to keep the frequency matching
the reference frequency from the reference oscillator.US-A-5 083 470 relates to a level sensor in
which the probe capacitance to ground is sensed by an
oscillator, phase detector and comparator circuit.US-A-5 049 826 describes a liquid level sensor
including a probe, an oscillator and the impedance
between the probe and the liquid is sensed by a bridge.US-A-5 005 407 describes a level sensor in
which the sensing element is an oscillator circuit, whose
emplitude changes are detected.An example of an automated blood/plasma
sampling system for which the present invention is
applicable is disclosed. An example of a piercing and
sampling probe is disclosed in WO-A-93/21975. Another
example of a sampling probe is disclosed in US-A-5 178
019, issued January 12, 1993, to Keiter. Automated sample handling systems are known
which automatically dispense fluid samples, such as blood
plasma and reagents, into a reaction well of a cuvette.
Such instruments are useful in the field of biochemical
analysis for measuring blood clotting times and for
automatically carrying out other bioassays. Additionally,
these instruments are useful in the field of chemical
assays for automatically carrying out chemical assays. An
automated sample handling system for carrying out blood
and plasma bioassays is described in WO-A-91/08464.In this particular system, fluid samples, such
as blood or plasma, are stored in containers, such as
test tubes, which are vacuum sealed by way of a rubber
septum that must be pierced in order to withdraw a
measured amount of the sample for testing purposes. WO-A-93/21975
discloses an example of a piercing and sampling
probe suitable for piercing and sampling a measured
amount of liquid.WO-A-91/08464 also includes a temperature
controlled housing provided for storing fluid samples and
reagents at a relatively cool temperature
