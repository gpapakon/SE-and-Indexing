<ABSTRACT>
A device for changing printing plates automatically in offset sheet printing machines having a plurality of printing units is to be improved, in particular in respect of the construction-related outlay for the means for conveying printing plates. Mounted on each plate cylinder of a printing unit is a guide device which can be pivoted so as to engage with and be disengaged from the plate cylinder and by means of which a new printing plate can be fed from above to the plate cylinder and an old printing plate can be conveyed out again, likewise towards the top, while the plate cylinder is rotating slowly backwards. Mounted above the printing machine is a guide rail on which a carriage of a transporting device with lifting devices can be moved along all the printing units of the printing machine. The transporting device conveys the printing plates from the printing units to a central printing-plate container and conveys new printing plates from the latter to the respectively intended printing unit where said printing plates are fed to the plate cylinder via the lifting device and the respectively engaged guide device.

Device for automatically changing printing plates in 
offset sheet printing presses with multiple printing 

units in which the plate cylinder (1) has in each 
case relative to the print start (DA) and the print 

end (DE) devices (3,4) arranged for remotely 
operateable release and fixing of a printing plate 

(32) and in each printing unit a guide device (21) 
mounted swivellably which can be set on and off 

against the plate cylinder (1) is arranged for 
feeding to and away the new and used printing plates 

(32) characterised in that arranged relative to all 
printing units there is provided a transport device 

(27) movable between these and a printing plate 
container (31) for new and used printing plates (32) 

with in each case holding devices (26) for grasping 
the new and used printing plates (32) wherein in 

each printing unit by means of the holding device 
(26) of the transport device (27) for the used 

printing plates a used printing plate (32) fed out 
from the plate cylinder (1) can be grasped and by 

the holding device (26) for the new printing plate 
this can be fed to over the swung on guide unit (21) 

to the plate cylinder. 
Device according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the transport unit (27) is constructed as a moving 

carriage (24) movable along a guide rail (22) 
arranged above the printing press and that the 

holding device (26) for in each case new and also 
used printing plates (32) are attached in each case 

on a lifting device (25). 
Device according to claim 1 and 2 characterised in 
that the guide unit (21) provided in each printing 

unit is constructed as a shaped member swingably  
 

mounted about an axis (7) running parallel to the 
axis of the plate cylinder (1), which at its 

swivellable end has a feed-in rail (9) extending 
across the format width of the plate cylinder (1) 

which can be set against the exterior periphery of 
the plate cylinder (1) in the region of the print 

start (DA) in such a fashion so that the front edge 
of the printing plate (32) via a feed-in surface 

(15) of the feed-in rail (9) laid against the plate 
cylinder (1) can be fed into the opened grasping 

region (17) of a tensioning rail (3). 
Device according to claim 3 characterised in that 
the guide unit (21) in each printing unit is 

arranged in each case within a protection (6) and 
that on the other side of the protection (6) two 

guide plates (11,12) are affixed forming in each 
case a format width slot through which a printing 

plate (32) hung up on the holding device (26) of a 
lifting device (25) can be fed to the plate cylinder 

(1) and a printing plate (32) fed out from the plate 
cylinder (1) can be grasped by means of a holding 

device (26). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the printing plate container 

(31) is arranged with reference to the lateral 
register direction in a line with the printing units 

of the printing press. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the holding devices (26) with 

a new or used printing plates (32) are constructed 
as pneumatic and/or mechanical suckers and/or 

grippers. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims  
 

characterised in that means are provided by which a 
printing plate to be fed in can be fed in with 

respect to the lateral register direction aligned 
with the plate cylinder (1) and these means on 

deposition of a newly to be fed in printing plate 
(32) located on the holding device (26) become 

effective in that between lifting or holding device 
(25,26) and the printing unit or protection (6) 

means co-operating in positively fitting fashion 
with one another are brought into contact. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the lifting and holding 

devices (25,26) for the printing plates (32) to be 
guided to and away have means by which the rolling 

up of used printing plates (32) can be countered. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that a control is provided by which 

the moving and working steps of the transport device 
(27) or of the driven carriage (24) together with 

the lifting device (25) and holding device (26) for 
changing the printing plates (32) can be carried out 

in time optimized fashion.
