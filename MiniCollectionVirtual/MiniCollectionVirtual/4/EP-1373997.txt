<ABSTRACT>
A method for controlling a manufacturing system (100) includes processing workpieces in a plurality of tools (120, 125); initiating a baseline control script (152, 154) for a selected tool (120, 125) of the plurality of tools (120, 125); providing context information for the baseline control script (152, 154); determining a tool type based on the context information; selecting a control routine for the selected tool (120, 125) based on the tool type; and executing the control routine to generate a control action for the selected tool (120, 125). A manufacturing system (100) includes a plurality of tools (120, 125) adapted to process workpieces, a control execution manager (150), and a control executor (220). The control execution manager (150) is adapted to initiate a baseline control script (152, 154) for a selected tool (120, 125) of the plurality of tools (120, 125) and provide context information for the baseline control script (152, 154). The control executor (220) is adapted to execute the baseline control script (152, 154), determine a tool type based on the context information, select a control routine for the selected tool (120, 125) based on the tool type, and execute the control routine to generate a control action for the selected tool (120, 125).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of semiconductor device manufacturing and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for controlling a tool using a baseline control script.There is a constant drive within the semiconductor industry to increase the quality, reliability and throughput of integrated circuit devices, e.g., microprocessors, memory devices, and the like. This drive is fueled by consumer demands for higher quality computers and electronic devices that operate more reliably. These demands have resulted in a continual improvement in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, e.g., transistors, as well as in the manufacture of integrated circuit devices incorporating such transistors. Additionally, reducing the defects in the manufacture of the components of a typical transistor also lowers the overall cost per transistor as well as the cost of integrated circuit devices incorporating such transistors.Generally, a set of processing steps is performed on a lot of wafers using a variety of processing tools, including photolithography steppers, etch tools, deposition tools, polishing tools, rapid thermal processing tools, implantation tools, etc. The technologies underlying semiconductor processing tools have attracted increased attention over the last several years, resulting in substantial refinements. However, despite the advances made in this area, many of the processing tools that are currently commercially available suffer certain deficiencies. In particular, such tools often lack advanced process data monitoring capabilities, such as the ability to provide historical parametric data in a user-friendly format, as well as event logging, real-time graphical display of both current processing parameters and the processing parameters of the entire run, and remote, i.e., local site and worldwide, monitoring. These deficiencies can engender nonoptimal control of critical processing parameters, such as throughput, accuracy, stability and repeatability, processing temperatures, mechanical tool parameters, and the like. This variability manifests itself as within-run disparities, run-to-run disparities and tool-to-tool disparities that can propagate into deviations in product quality and performance, whereas an ideal monitoring and diagnostics system for such tools would provide a means of monitoring this variability, as well as providing means for optimizing control of critical parameters.One technique for improving the operation of a semiconductor processing line includes using a
