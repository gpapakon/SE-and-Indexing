<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
inactivating viral/bacterial/parasitic contamination of
liquid, lyophilized, reconstituted blood cell
compositions comprising erythrocytes, platelets, etc,
or protein fractions.A major concern in the use of stored or donated
homologous blood or plasma protein preparations
derived from human blood is the possibility of viral
and bacterial contamination.Viral inactivation by stringent sterilization is not
acceptable since this could also destroy the 
functional components of the blood, particularly the
erythrocytes (red blood cells) and the labile plasma
proteins. Viable RBC's can be characterized by one
or more of the following: capability of synthesizing
ATP; cell morphology; P50 values; oxyhemoglobin,
methemoglobin and hemichrome values; MCV, MCH, and
MCHC values; cell enzyme activity; and invivo
survival. Thus, if lyophilized then reconstituted
and virally inactivated cells are damaged to the
extent that the cells are not capable of metabolizing
or synthesizing ATP, or the cell circulation is
compromised, then their utility in transfusion
medicine is compromised.There is an immediate need to develop protocols for
the deactivation of viruses that can be present in
the human red blood supply. For example, only
recently has a test been developed for Non A, Non B
hepatitis, but such screening methods, while reducing
the incidence of viral transmission, do not make the
blood supply completely safe or virus free. Current
statistics indicate that the transfusion risk per
unit of transfused blood is as high as 1:100 for
Non A, Non B hepatitis, and ranges from 1:40,000 to
1:1,000,000 for HIV, depending on geographic
location. Clearly, it is desirable to develop a
method which inactivates or removes virus
indiscriminately from the blood.Contamination problems also exist for blood plasma
protein fractions, such as plasma fractions
containing immune globulins and clotting factors.
For example, new cases of non A, non B hepatitis have
occurred in hemophilia patients receiving protein
fractions containing Factor VIII which have been 
treated for viral inactivation according to approved
methods. Therefore, there is a need for improved viral
inactivation treatment of blood protein fractions.The present invention thus provides a process for
reducing viral, bacterial and/or parasitic contaminants
in a composition comprising blood, a blood component,
cell culture or a component of a cell culture, comprising
the steps of:
mixing said composition in a liquid state with a
chemical radiation
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for reducing viral, bacterial and/or
parasitic contaminants in a composition comprising blood,

a blood component, cell culture or a component of a cell
culture, comprising the steps of:


mixing said composition in a liquid state with a
chemical radiation sensitizer capable of targeting said

viral, bacterial and/or parasitic contaminants;
treating the composition with an organic solvent or
detergent; and
exposing the composition in the liquid or
lyophilized state to electromagnetic radiation of a

wavelength and intensity and for a period of time
sufficient to activate said sensitizer, whereby the

activation of the sensitizer reduces said contamination
in said composition.
A process according to Claim 1, wherein the

composition comprises virally contaminated blood plasma
or blood plasma fraction and is treated with an organic

solvent or detergent effective to decrease the viral
titre of the blood plasma or fraction.
A process according to Claim 2, wherein said blood
plasma faction comprises serum albumin, immune globulins,

or a clotting factor.
A process according to Claim 3, wherein said blood
plasma fraction comprises factor VIII.
A process according to Claim 1, wherein the cell
culture comprises a recombinant plasma protein.
A process according to Claim 5, wherein the
recombinant plasma protein is a recombinant serum albumin

or recombinant clotting factor.
A process according to Claim 6, wherein the
recombinant clotting factor is recombinant factor VIII. 
A process according to any preceding Claim wherein
said radiation comprises penetrating, ionizing radiation.
A process according to Claim 8, wherein said
penetrating, ionizing radiation comprises X-rays or

gamma-rays.
A process according to Claim 9, wherein said X-rays
are produced by a metallic target source comprising

molybdenum, palladium, rhodium, silver, tungsten,
titanium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel,

copper or zinc.
A process according to any preceding Claim wherein
said chemical sensitizer comprises molecules which

contain metal and/or halogen atom(s).
A process according to Claim 9 or 10, wherein said
chemical sensitizer comprises molecules which contain

metal and/or halogen atom(s) which increase the overall
mass attenuation coefficient of the sensitizer to

radiation from a predetermined X-ray target source.
A process according to Claim 11 or 12, wherein said
metal atom(s) comprise platinum.
A process according to Claim 11, 12 or 13, wherein
said chemical sensitizer molecules are derived from

membrane-binding molecules.
A process according to Claim 14, wherein said
membrane-binding molecules are fatty acid-based molecules

or organic dyes.
A process according to Claim 15, wherein said
membrane-binding molecules comprise porphyrins.
A process according to Claim 16, wherein said
porphyrins comprise hematoporphyrin and hematoporphyrin

derivatives.
A process according to any preceding Claim, wherein
said organic solvent comprises tri-N-butyl phosphate. 
A process according to any preceding Claim wherein
said detergent comprises a non-ionic detergent.
A process according to any preceding Claim, wherein
lyophilization is carried out to a residual moisture

content of 10% or less.
