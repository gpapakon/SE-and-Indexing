<ABSTRACT>
An article of manufacture suitable to be used as a balancing 
mass in machines, in particular household appliances, and a 

process for the production thereof. 
The article of manufacture (1; 10; 11) comprises a shell (2), 
preferably in plastic material, that encloses a body (3) formed 

by at least one composition which is cast in the fluid state 
inside the shell (2) and allowed to solidify, incorporating 

stiffening elements (5), thus obtaining the article of 
manufacture (1; 10; 11) in the finished state. Preferably the 

composition is a conglomerate comprising both inert and binder 
materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an article of manufacture 
suitable to be used as a balancing mass in machines, in 
particular household appliances, and a process for the 
production thereof. In machines, for example household appliances, such as 
washing machines, dishwashers and the like, or like tractors 
and machine tools, masses are used, in particular 
counterweights, to balance statically and dynamically such 
machines. Generally, these counterweights (i.e. balancing masses) are 
made from a conglomerate mixture. In particular, said 
conglomerate are made of an inert material such as sand, fine 
gravel and metal scalings, a binder, preferably of the enhanced 
cement type, and water. In same cases said counterweights are 
also provided with a reinforcement consisting of internal 
stiffeners. The production cycle of said counterweights varies depending 
on the composition of the abovementioned mixture. However, it 
comprises essentially the following steps: 
preparing a fluid mixture, casting said mixture in the fluid state into moulds of metal 
or plastic, such as ABS, while vibrating for compacting the 
mixture in the mould, optionally pressing the semi-dry mixture, dismantling the mould, once the mixture has reached maturity, 
with manual opening of the half-shells of the mould and 
extracting a semi-finished mass,  finishing the mass by removing the burrs formed by the seam 
of the half-shells of the mould. These conventional methods have several drawbacks. First of all the production cycle is fairly long, complex and 
expensive. In particular, they are affected by the operations 
required to prepare the reinforcement, the length of time 
ranging from one to two days for the mixture to mature and the 
subsequent manual operation of opening the half-shells of the 
mould. Moreover, frequent changes in shape and dimensions are 
required for these masses thus involving additional working 
activities and costs. Finished counterweights also exhibit a number of drawbacks. In fact, the counterweights undergo breakages, pulverisation 
and/or crumbling which involve a reduction in the weight. A 
further drawback is the high dimensional difference shown by 
counterweights of the same type due to the different 
deformation of each mould, especially if made of plastic, which 
happen as a result of the continual stresses to which the 
moulds are subjected during the production process. Lastly the 
surface of the conventional counterweights is not smooth and 
they are not pleasant-looking. A first object of
