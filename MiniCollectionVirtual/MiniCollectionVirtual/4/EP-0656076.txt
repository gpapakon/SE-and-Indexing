<ABSTRACT>
An "atmospheric" processing furnace (1) is insulated from the naturally-occurring variations in ambient pressure. In one embodiment a gas valve (9) in an exhaust duct (7b) from a sealed scavenger box (7) is controlled by a feedback loop including a control system (10) and a pressure sensor (11).

 FURNACE AND CONTROL METHOD THEREFORBackground of the Invention1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to a furnace for the heat treatment of product and in particular for the heat treatment of semiconductor material used in the fabrication of microelectronic components. The invention also relates to a method of operating a furnace for the heat treatment of semiconductor material.2. Description of the Related ArtIt is known to subject wafers of semiconductor material to a variety of different processing operations in a furnace which comprises a tube of highly purified refractory material. A tube of very pure quartz is widely used, the product for treatment being loaded into the tube from one end and heated therein by electrical heating means operating from without the tube. Tubes extending vertically or horizontally are normally used.In the fabrication of microelectronic components it is known to subject wafers of semiconductor material to heat treatment in a variety of different gas environments and these operations are commonly carried out at atmospheric pressure, the appropriate gas being led into the furnace tube at or adjacent to the upstream end thereof and allowed to exhaust from the downstream end of the tube to a scavenger box from which the exhaust gas is drawn away via an exhaust duct.It has long been appreciated that precise control of temperature and gas flow rates is required for reliably consistent semiconductor fabrication techniques but heretofore no attempts have been made, when operating substantially at atmospheric pressure, to compensate, by controlling pressure, for variations in ambient pressure 

which naturally occur from day to day.Sealed unit low pressure and high pressure systems are available for the heat treatment of product but these systems are custom designed and are relatively expensive.Summary of the InventionSurprisingly, I have now found that improved product (and in particular improved semiconductor fabrication) is possible if in addition to temperature and gas flow rate control in a furnace operating substantially at atmospheric pressure, means is provided to control the pressure so that the daily atmospheric pressure changes that naturally occur do not affect the absolute pressure (or at least the partial pressure of a reactive gas) existing within the furnace. Thus, one aspect of the present invention relates to a method of operating a processing furnace having a gas exhaust which method includes controlling the pressure of the gas exhaust at a constant

 CLAIMS
1. A method of operating a processing furnace substantially at atmospheric pressure, which includes controlling the absolute pressure in the furnace, or at least the partial pressure of a reactive gas in the furnace, to a substantially constant level irrespective of changes in ambient pressure.
2. A method of operating a processing furnace according to claim 1 which has a gas exhaust, which includes controlling the pressure of the gas exhaust to a substantially constant level which lies in the range between 0.05 and 40% above ambient pressure.
3. A method of operating a semiconductor processing furnace according to claim 2, which includes controlling the pressure of the gas exhaust so that variations in absolute pressure within the furnace do not exceed 5 millibars and preferably do not exceed 0.5 millibar.
4. A method according to claim 2, in which the gas exhaust feeds into a scavenger box having a door and an exhaust duct which includes a pressure-sensitive valve, the door being sealed to the box.
5. A method according to claim 4, in which a bleed gas is fed to the scavenger box to always maintain a pressure in the box which is a variable but slight amount above current atmospheric level whereby the operating pressure in the furnace is unaffected by changes in ambient pressure.
6. A method of operating a processing furnace according to claim 1, in which the partial pressure of reacting gas(es) in the furnace is controlled to be at a constant level which is substantially never greater than the existing ambient pressure. 



 7. A tubular processing furnace comprising a furnace tube, means for heating the furnace tube, means for supplying gas to an upstream end of the tube, a scavenger box at the downstream end of the box into which exhaust gas from the tube flows, a door to the scavenger box to provide access to the downstream end of the tube and an exhaust duct for removing gas from the scavenger box, characterised in that the door seals to the box and means is provided to maintain the pressure of gas in the box at a predetermined constant level which exceeds the maximum naturally occurring ambient pressure.
8. A furnace according to claim 7, in which the pressure maintaining means is set to maintain an overpressure of between 0.05 and 40% of said maximum ambient pressure.
9. A tubular processing furnace according to claim 7 or claim 8, in which a loading system for the furnace comprises an end plate for the tube and a scavenger door for the scavenger box, characterised in that the scavenger door is provided with means to seal to the scavenger box, and in that means is provided for controlling the pressure in the scavenger box to a predetermined constant level which is at least slightly supra-atmospheric.
10. A kit of parts to adapt a conventional semiconductor atmospheric processing furnace for operation in accordance with the method of any one of claims 1 to 6.
