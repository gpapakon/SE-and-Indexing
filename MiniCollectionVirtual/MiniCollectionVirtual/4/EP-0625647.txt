<ABSTRACT>
A wet-type friction clutch disc (110) having universally shaped 
friction 

segments (112) manufactured from a nearly scrapless process. Relative 
juxtaposition of the segments (112) with gaps (116) will achieved desired 

amounts of 
cooling fluid flow into and out of the friction discs (110) with 

corresponding 
desired levels of hydrostatic pressure buildup between the discs (110).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a friction disc for use 
with a wet-type multi-plate clutch. Such multi-plate clutches 
generally comprise a plurality of interleaved friction discs and reaction 
plates which engage to provide the transmission of energy from a 
drive engine to a drive wheel. Wet-type clutches also utilize a 
lubricant such as oil to reduce clutch wear, cool the friction facings 
of the friction discs and provide desired hydrostatic forces between 
the reaction plates and friction discs. In the interest of optimizing clutch life, operational smoothness, 
and cooling efficiency for the friction facings, the literature and art 
relating to wet-type clutches evidences numerous clutch designs 
producing a large variety of friction facing materials and designs of 
friction facing materials. A common friction facing, currently 
available is typified by the disclosure of US-A-4 260 047 and US-A-4 674 616. 
Both patents disclose friction discs, for 
use with clutches, which are formed from friction material and 
produced from the joinder of a plurality of arcuate segments. 
Commonly, the arcuate segments are pre-grooved to allow for cooling 
oil to flow over the friction facing during clutch operation. Further, 
the arcuate segments are designed to interlock together to form an 
annular friction facing intended to be bonded to an annular core plate. The creation and design of arcuate segment friction facings is 
intended to meet a goal of reducing the amount of waste produced  
 
during the manufacture of the friction facings. The friction facings are 
usually composed of sintered metal or paper which normally is 
impregnated with a phenolic resin. The friction facing segments are 
commonly cut from a continuous strip of rectangular sheeting 
composed of the friction material which is fed through the die or 
cutting apparatus. The friction material is relatively expensive and, 
therefore, it is desirable to optimize the elimination of waste from the 
manufacturing process. Further, elimination of waste product from 
the manufacture process assists in meeting compliance standards, for 
the proper disposal of any scrap, which are the focus of increasing 
regulation by current environmental regulations. Any scrap resulting 
from the cutting process must be disposed of in an appropriate 
manner and, because of the materials from which the friction facing 
is manufactured, this disposal is becoming increasingly costly. An ongoing objective for wet-type multiple clutch discs 
involves the provision of

<CLAIMS>
A friction disc for use with a wet-type multi-plate 
clutch with cooling fluid for selectively 

transmitting driving forces from an engine to a road 
wheel, comprising an annular core plate having opposed 

flat annular surfaces and a plurality of friction 
segments (812) affixed to at least one surface of the 

core plate and spaced at predetermined intervals, the 
friction segments (812) defining discrete friction 

surfaces and gaps (816, 818) located between the 
friction segments (812), characterized in that the 

friction segments (812) are generally triangular in 
shape and are positioned on the core plate such that the 

gaps (816, 818) between the triangular friction segments 
alternate between a generally straight gap (816) formed 

by generally parallel edges of the friction segments 
(812) and radially expansive gaps (818) in the outward 

direction, wherein rotation of the friction disc (810) 
in one direction creates a full flow of cooling fluid 

through the generally straight (816) and radially 
expansive (818) gaps, and rotation of the friction disc 

(810) in the opposite direction creates a cooling fluid 
flow through the generally straight gaps (816) and a 

cooling fluid flow impedance in the radially expansive 
gaps (818) to create a required hydrostatic pressure. 
A friction disc as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
the triangular friction segments (812) are positioned on 

the core plate in an alternating inverted orientation. 
A friction disc as claimed in claim 1 or claim 
2, wherein the friction segments (812) are all of the 

same shape.  
 
A friction disc as claimed in any of the 
preceding claims, wherein the relative sizes of the 

discrete friction surfaces and the gaps (816, 818) is 
defined by an aspect ratio comparison of the friction 

surface area and the gap area. 
A friction disc as claimed in any of the 
preceding claims, wherein the friction segments (812) 

are formed from a continuous strip of friction 
material. 
A friction disc as claimed in any of the 
preceding claims, wherein the friction segments (812) 

are affixed to both of the opposed flat annular surfaces 
of the core plate.
