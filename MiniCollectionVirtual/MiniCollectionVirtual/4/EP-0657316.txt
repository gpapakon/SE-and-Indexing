<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mechanism for moving a panel 
(3) with respect to a 

roof (1) of a vehicle between a first position, in which 
said panel (3) closes an opening 

(2) provided in the roof (1) of the vehicle, and a 
second position, in which said panel (3) releases the 

opening (2) provided in the 
roof of the vehicle at least for the greater part. The panel (3) is 

near its 
sides supported by supports, which are first pivoted obliquely upwards 

by means of a setting mechanism (4) so as to move the 
panel (3) from the first 

position to the second position, and which are then moved to a position 
above the roof portion located beside the opening. A support is coupled, 

via a gear transmission (93) which is movable 
by means of the setting mechanism (4), 

to a rack which is capable of movement with respect to the support.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a mechanism for moving a panel
with respect to a roof of a vehicle according to the preamble of claim 1A mechanism for moving a panel is known from European Patent
Application No. 0 543 427. With this known construction the panel still
extends over part of the opening in its second position.A mechanism according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from US-A-5,238,290The object of the invention is to improve the mechanism
of the above kind.According to the invention this can be achieved by the features of the characterizing portion
of claim 1.When using the construction according to the invention
the panel will be moved jointly with a rack-like means
during the initial movement of the panel between the first position and
the second position by the height adjustment members.Directly or after a movement over a predetermined distance has taken
place the first rack means will be stopped, which makes it possible
upon further movement of the panel by means of the setting
mechanism to effect a movement of the panel with respect
to the stopped rack-like means via the gear-rack transmission, so that 
when the panel moves between said first position and said second position
it is possible to effect a movement of the panel over a comparatively large
distance compared with the movement of the height adjustment member which moves within
the stationary guide rail and can be used both for the pivoting and sliding movements of the panelThe invention will be explained in more detail hereafter
with reference to a few embodiments of the construction according to the
invention diagrammatically illustrated in the accompanying Figures.Figure 1 is a diagrammatic view of the panel in a first
position, wherein the panel closes an opening provided in a roof of a
vehicle, and wherein a few parts have been left out for easy reference.Figure 2 is a view corresponding with Figure 1, wherein
the panel is tilted upwards at the beginning of the movement between the
first position and the second position.Figures 3 and 4 illustrate further intermediate
positions during the movement of the panel from the first position, in
which said panel closes the opening in the roof, to the second position,
in which the panel at least partially releases the opening in the roof.Figure 5 shows the second or final position of the
panel, in which the opening provided in the roof is released by the panel
as much as possible.Figure 6 is a diagrammatic sectional view of a support
connected to the panel, a sliding piece and a pinion
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A mechanism for moving a panel (3; 72) with
respect to a roof (1; 70) of a vehicle between a first

position, in which said panel closes an opening (2; 71) in
the roof of the vehicle, and a second position, in which

said panel opens the opening provided in the roof of the
vehicle at least for the greater part, comprising:


a panel (3; 72), said panel having sides extending
in a direction of movement of the panel;
a stationary guide rail (5; 77) on each side of the
panel and extending in the direction of movement of the

panel;
a setting mechanism (4) including a height
adjustment member (10; 80) guided in each guide rail for

moving the panel from said first position to said second
position during which the panel is pivoted into an upwardly

sloping position;
first rack means (42; 91) extending in the
direction of movement of the panel and being movably coupled

to the panel permitting a relative movement between the
panel and the first rack means;
second rack means (41; 89) secured to the panel and
extending and being movable parallel to the first rack

means;
a gear (44; 93) in engagement with the first and
second rack means and being drivably coupled to the setting

mechanism;
means (47-49; 86-88, 92) for stopping said first
rack means for at least a part of the movement of the

setting mechanism so that the panel is driven by the setting
mechanism and additionally by the gear which rotates as a

result of a movement between the setting mechanism and the
first rack means,

   
characterized
 in that the height adjustment member
(10; 80) for initiating the pivoting movement of the panel 

(3) is drivably coupled to the gear (44; 93) to control the
gear-rack transmission when it is displaced within the

stationary guide rail (5; 77).
A mechanism according to claim 1, characterized in
that said panel (3) can be pivoted obliquely upwards by means of a tilting

lever (10; 80) of said setting mechanism (4), said tilting lever being pivotally coupled
to a driving slide (8; 78), which is movable in the direction of movement of the

panel, and to a support (18) secured to the panel, whereby said tilting lever
and said support are pivotally coupled together and are movable in the

longitudinal direction of said support.
A mechanism according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a stop means is provided, which, upon

movement of the panel (3) to said second position, limits the movement of the
setting mechanism (4), whereby said stop means can move out resiliently over

a predetermined distance in said direction of movement.
A mechanism according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the first rack means (42) being movably journal led

in a support (47) connected with said panel is provided with a stop means (48), which
after a predetermined movement of the panel in the opening direction comes

into engagement with a stop means (49) occupying a fixed position with respect
to the roof. 
A mechanism according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said gear (44) is coupled to said setting

mechanism (4) by means of a pivotable coupling rod (56).
A mechanism according to any one of the claims 1 - 3,

characterized in that said support (18) is movable with respect to a guide means
and that said guide means (74) supports the gear (93),

whilst means (86-88, 92) are
provided which prevent said first rack means (91) from moving in its

longitudinal direction for at least part of the distance over which the
guide means moves from the closed to the open position.
A mechanism according to claim 6, characterized in
that said first rack means (91) supported by said guide means (74) is coupled to one

end (88) of a coupling rod (86), which is movable with respect to said guide means,
whilst the other end of said coupling rod is pivotable about a pivot pin (87)

occupying a fixed position with respect to the roof.
A mechanism according to claim 6 or 7, characterized
in that said guide means (74) is slidably guided through slideways (76) near one

end (75), said slideways extending parallel to the intended direction of
movement of the panel, whereby said guide means is furthermore pivotable

about said end (75).
A mechanism according to any one of the preceding
claims 6 - 8, characterized in that said panel can be pivoted obliquely

upwards by means of a tilting lever (80), which is pivotally coupled to a
sliding piece (78), which is movable in the intended direction of movement of

the panel, as well as to said guide means (74).
A mechanism according to claim 9, characterized
in that a spring mechanism is coupled to said sliding piece (78), which spring

mechanism attempts to force the sliding piece into a position in which
