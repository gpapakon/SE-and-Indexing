<ABSTRACT>
A spindle extension (10), especially for drilling and milling 
operations is desirable to complete many modern die molds or to protect 

the host machine spindle from undesirable wear. The inventive spindle 
extension (10) contains its own pull stud draw bar assembly (21) that 

works in 
tandem with the host machine power draw bar that is easily activated to 

provide quick and secure tool changes. Surrogate and long-reach 
embodiments are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a milling machine 
spindle extension having a self-contained pull-stud draw bar assembly. There are two widely recognized problems within the 
profile milling industry. First, modern molds and dies currently 
include deeper cavities than were previously used. Standard milling 
tools are typically too short to construct such deep cavities Second, 
direct coupling of a milling tool to a host machine spindle may result 
in undesirable wear and abuse to that spindle during heavy milling 
operations. Commonly attempted solutions to the two noted problems 
include spindle extensions. Two different types of spindle extensions 
are employed to alleviate the two problems. A long-reach spindle 
extension can help achieve deeper mold cavities. Surrogate spindle 
extensions help to minimize the wear and abuse to a host machine 
spindle bore during heavy milling. The surrogate extensions are 
typically much shorter and more durable than the long-reach 
extensions. Previously, both types of extension include the 
undesirable feature that, once attached to the machine spindle, the 
machine power draw bar tool-connecting apparatus is unusable. The 
latter feature renders spindle extensions cost inefficient relative to 
conventional milling directly from the host machine spindle. A commonly used spindle extension, for both types of 
applications described above, is called a weldon shank spindle  
 
extension. There are several problems with weldon shank configurations 
stemming from the necessary use of set screws that maintain the tool in 
a secured position within the spindle extension. The set screws cause 
tool holder elongation that increases tool vibration and tends to 
hasten tool runout. Further, set screws tend to vibrate loose during 
heavy milling operations. Other problems with weldon shank 
configurations include the low percentage of surface contact between 
the tool shank and the spindle extension tool receiving bore, again 
causing excess vibration. Other spindle extensions include collet systems in which 
a tool holder is secured by a draw bolt contained within the spindle 
extension. Draw bolt collet systems are inefficient because the entire 
extension must be removed from the host machine to access the draw bolt 
for tool changes. Other collet systems use exterior nuts to secure a 
tool in place but these have several disadvantages. A main 
disadvantage is that an exterior nut increases the diameter of the 
extension which results in a lower clearance profile, and
