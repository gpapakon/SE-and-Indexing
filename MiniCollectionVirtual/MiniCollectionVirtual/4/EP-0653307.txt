<ABSTRACT>
A mimeographic printing machine comprises a flexible 
rotary cylindrical printing drum, a lower pusher roller, an 

inside pusher roller, inside pusher roller controlling means, 
and printing sheet conveying means. A stencil paper is wound 

on the outer surface of the flexible rotary cylindrical 
printing drum. The lower pusher roller is provided in 

parallel with the flexible rotary cylindrical printing drum 
with a predetermined space between the lower pusher roller 

and the flexible rotary cylindrical printing drum and inside 
the flexible rotary cylindrical printing drum. The inside 

pusher roller controlling means moves the inside pusher 
roller between a deformation position to push the flexible 

tubular wall radially outwardly thereby to deform the 
flexible tubular wall towards the lower pusher roller in the 

case of printing, and a steady position to release the 
flexible tubular wall from the deformation in the case of 

non-printing. The printing sheet conveying means moves the 
printing sheet from the sheet supplying section through the 

space.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mimeographic printing machine with the features cited
in the preamble of claim 1.A mimeographic printing machine of this type is disclosed in US-A-5,081,924. In practice,
the printed sheets are stacked on a sheet discharging tray in the sheet discharging
section with the print side at the top. Hence, when, before the ink on the first printing
sheet dries, a second printing sheet is laid on the first printing sheet, then an ink
transferring phenomenon may occur: that is, the ink of the first printing sheet may
partially transfer onto the back of the second printing sheet. That is, ink set-off may
occur.In order to prevent the ink set-off, the following method has been employed in the art:
that is, a blank sheet, namely an intermediate sheet, is laid on the printed sheet, so that
the printed sheets are not directly brought into contact with each other. The same is
applied if a group of printed sheets should be separated over a predetermined number of
printed sheets. In order to supply the intermediate sheet in a correct manner to the sheet
discharging tray, it is necessary to provide a high speed sheet supplying device which is
able to supply the intermediate sheets correctly, so that the intermediate sheets and the
printed sheets are alternately delivered to the sheet discharging tray. However, the
available device is considerably expensive and the use of the device is not economical.It is the object of the invention to provide a mimeographic printing machine of the above-mentioned
type with an improved supply of intermediate sheets or dividing sheets in a
more economical way.This object is attained with a mimeographic printing machine having the features cited in
claim 1. In the mimeographic printing machine, the lower
pusher roller may have a printing sheet clamping mechanism
which is adapted to clamp the front leading end portion of
the printing sheet supplied from the sheet supplying section
in such a manner that the front leading end portion can be
released, and to convey the printing sheet towards the sheet 
discharging section in association with the rotation of the
lower pusher roller, and which the lower pusher roller may
serve as the printing sheet conveying means.In the mimeographic printing machine thus organized,
the inside pusher roller is selectively set at the steady
position by the inside pusher roller position controlling
means in association with the sheet supplying operation of
the sheet supplying section. Under the condition that the
inside pusher

<CLAIMS>
A mimeographic printing machine having:

a flexible rotary cylindrical printing drum (1) including
a flexible tubular wall (7) enabling to pass an ink, on the outer

surface of which a stencil paper is wound;
a lower pusher roller (65) in parallel with said flexible
rotary cylindrical printing drum (1) with a predetermined space

between said lower pusher roller (36) and said flexible rotary
cylindrical printing drum (1); and
an inside pusher roller (23) provided inside said flexible
rotary cylindrical printing drum (1) in such a manner that said

inside pusher roller (23) is extended in parallel with one of the
generating lines of said flexible rotary cylindrical printing 

drum (1), said inside pusher roller (23) being movable between a
deformation position to push said flexible tubular wall (7)

radially outwardly thereby to deform said flexible tubular
wall towards said lower pusher roller (63), and a steady position

to release said flexible tubular wall from the deformation,

in which, with said inside pusher roller (23) at
said deformation position, a printing sheet (P) is supplied from

a sheet supplying section (77) to the space between said flexible
rotary cylindrical printing drum (1) and said lower pusher roller (63)

to perform a pressure type mimeographic printing operation,
and said printing sheet (P), after printed, is discharged to a

sheet discharging section (79),
inside pusher roller controlling means (33,35) for
selectively positioning said inside pusher roller (23) at said

steady position in association with the sheet supplying
operation of said sheet supplying section (77); and

printing sheet conveying means, characterised in that said
printing sheet conveying means which, under
the condition that said inside pusher roller (23) is held at said

steady position by the operation of said inside pusher roller
controlling means (33,35), causes said printing sheet (P) from said sheet

supplying section (77) to pass through the space between said
flexible rotary cylindrical printing drum (1) and said lower

pusher roller (63), in such a manner that said printing sheet (P) is
not brought into contact with said flexible rotary

cylindrical printing drum (1), so that said printing sheet (P) is 
discharged into said sheet discharging section (79) without being

printed.
A mimeographic printing machine according to
claim 1, characterised in that the space between said flexible rotary

cylindrical printing drum (1) has the width that the printing
sheet (P) is pressed by said outer surface of said flexible

rotary cylindrical printing drum (1) during the printing sheet (P)
moving into the space when said inside pusher roller (23) is held

at said deformation position, and that the printing sheet (P)
pass through the space without contacting said flexible

rotary cylindrical printing drum (1) when said inside pusher
roller (23) is held at said steady position.
A mimeographic printing machine according to
claim 1 or 2, characterised in that said lower pusher roller (63) has a printing

sheet clamping mechanism (67,69,71) which is adapted to clamp the front
leading end portion of said printing sheet (P) supplied from said

sheet supplying section (77) in such a manner that said front
leading end portion can be released, and which conveys said

printing sheet (P) through the space between said flexible rotary
cylindrical printing drum (1) and said lower pusher roller (63) in

association with the rotation of said lower pusher roller (63),
