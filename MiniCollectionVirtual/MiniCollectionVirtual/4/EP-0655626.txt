<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method of diagnosing 
Alzheimer's disease in a human patient by measuring the 

amount of p33 present in a biological sample from a 
patient who may have Alzheimer's disease relative to the 

amount of p33 in a control sample from an unaffected 
human. Also included in the invention are diagnostic 

kits for Alzheimer's disease and methods of screening for 
effective therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's disease, and interalia provides methods of 
testing a human biological sample to provide an indication 
as to whether the human patient associated with that sample 
is suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating 
impairment of cognitive function prevalent in individuals 
generally forty-five or older. Despite the toll taken by 
this disease, it remains poorly understood. The degree 
of dementia in AD has been correlated with the number of 
senile plaques (SPs) found in the cerebral cortex of AD 
patients (Roth et al., Nature 209:109, 1966). 
Histologically, SPs are surrounded by degenerating 
neurites and reactive astrocytes (Wisniewski and Terry, 
Progress in Neuropathology 2:23, 1973), and 
biochemically, SPs contain a small insoluble fibrillary 
protein termed β-amyloid (Glenner and Wong, Biochem. 
Biophys. Res. Commun. 120:885-890). Molecular cloning of 
the β-amyloid gene from normal fetal tissue (Kang et al., 
Nature 325:733-736, 1987) and AD brain tissue (Zain et 
al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:929-933, 1988) has 
revealed that it is derived from a larger precursor 
protein, the amyloid precursor protein (APP). In 
addition to senile plaques, Alzheimer's disease is 
characterized by abundant neurofibrillary tangles in 
neuronal perikarya and proximal dendrites, and 
granulovacuolar degeneration in pyramidal cells of the 
hippocampus. The cause of AD is not known, nor is there a 
treatment for AD. In addition, there is no diagnostic 
test for AD in either pre-symptomatic or symptomatic 
patients. Current methods used to diagnose AD involve 
analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or brain tissue 
obtained from postmortem patients.  The annexins (or lipocortins) are a family of 
proteins which bind to negatively charged phospholipids 
in a calcium-dependent manner. They are found in a 
variety of cell types in higher and lower eukaryotes. 
The annexin family of calcium binding proteins shows 
features of both soluble and membrane proteins. The 
primary sequences of the 13 known annexin family members 
are largely composed of four highly conserved homologous 
repeats. In contrast to the bulk of the protein, the N 
termini of the annexins differ greatly in length and 
sequence (Crompton et al., Cell 55:1-3, 1988; Barton et 
al., Eur. J. Biochem. 198:749-760, 1991). The in vivo role of the annexins is unknown. One 
proposed function is involvement in membrane-membrane 
fusion and exocytosis (Creutz,

A method of testing a human biological sample to 
provide an indication as to whether the human patient 

associated with that sample is suffering from Alzheimer's 
disease, the method comprising the steps of measuring the 

amount of p33 present in said sample and comparing the 
measured amounted to that present in a control sample 

associated with an unaffected human, a relative level of p33 
in said biological sample 50 percent above said control 

sample indicating a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. 
A method according to Claim 1, wherein said 
biological sample is lumbar CSF, ventricular CSF, brain 

tissue homogenate or a thin section of brain tissue.
