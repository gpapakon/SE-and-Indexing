<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a process for the preparation of nitrophenols. More particularly, the invention relates to the preparation of p-nitrophenol. The process of preparation of the invention, which consists in preparing p-nitrophenol by nitrosation of phenol in the presence of sulphuric acid and then oxidation of p-nitrosophenol with nitric acid, is characterised in that, in the first nitrosation stage, the concentration of sulphuric acid is at least equal to 60% and, in the second stage, at the end of the oxidation reaction, the concentration of sulphuric acid is at most equal to 80%, which makes it possible to precipitate p-nitrophenol which is then separated.

A process for the preparation of a p-nitrophenol by the nitrosation of a phenolic
compound in the presence of sulphuric acid, followed by the oxidation of the p-nitrosophenol

by nitric acid, characterised in that in the first nitrosation stage the concentration of sulphuric
acid is at least equal to 60% and in the second stage, at the end of the oxidation reaction, the

sulphuric acid concentration is at the most equal to 80%, which makes it possible to

preferably methyl or ethyl; a perfluorinated alkyl radical having 1 to 4 carbon atoms;

a halogen atom, preferably chlorine, bromine or fluorine,
n is a number equal to 0.1 or 2.
A process according to either claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the phenolic
compound is phenol.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the sulphuric acid
concentration in the nitrosation stage is between 60% and 90%, preferably between 70% and
