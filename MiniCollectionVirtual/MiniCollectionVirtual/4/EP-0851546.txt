<ABSTRACT>
An optical chamber for use in a laser or other optical device includes a
hollow container with holes at opposite ends. A fixed mirror is sealed to the

housing and overlies one hole, whereas a movable mirror (42) is sealed to the housing by
a flexible seal such as an O-ring (44) interposed between the mirror and the housing. A

variable force actuator (46) such as a piezoelectric element biases the movable mirror (42)
against the seal. By varying the force applied by the actuator, the movable mirror

can be moved towards and away from the fixed mirror to vary the path length
through the chamber. The chamber can provide a low cost tunable gas laser.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the art of optics, and more particularly
relates to chambers such as those used as cavities in gas lasers.Common optical devices such as gas lasers incorporate enclosed
chambers for holding a medium such as a gas or plasma and optical elements in
optical communication with the interior of the chamber. The optical elements such
as lenses, mirrors and windows direct light through the medium contained in the
chamber, so that the light can interact with the medium. For example, a simple,
economical gas laser includes a tubular housing defining an interior space in the
form of an elongated bore, the housing having openings at opposite ends of the bore.
A fully reflective mirror is fixed to the housing at one end of the bore, whereas a
partially reflective mirror is also fixed to the housing at the opposite end of the bore.
The chamber is filled with a suitable lasing gas such as CO2, nitrogen and helium.
Electrodes or other devices for applying energy to the gas contained in the chamber
are provided for maintaining the gas in an excited state. The gas emits radiation at
wavelengths corresponding to transitions between energy states. The light is
repeatedly reflected between the mirrors; the reflected light stimulates further light
emission coherent with the reflected light. In this manner, the light is amplified by
stimulated emission of radiation.For maximum amplification, the distance between the mirrors should
be equal to an integral number of wavelengths of the light. Typically, the excited
gas within the chamber can undergo any one of several transitions between states,
and can emit light at different wavelengths. One wavelength is well matched to the
distance between the mirrors, whereas other wavelengths are not as well matched.
The best matched wavelength is strongly amplified whereas the other wavelengths 
are not. Thus, the light emitted by the laser will consist predominantly of the best-matched
wavelength.The simple and economical laser structure discussed above does not
provide for adjustment of the distance between the mirrors. The predominant
wavelength is set by conditions established when the housing and mirrors are
manufactured as, for example, the length of the tube and the dimensions of the
components used to mount the mirrors at the ends of the tube. The predominant
wavelength of the laser cannot be adjusted. If the length of the housing changes due
to thermal expansion, the distance between the mirrors will change and the
predominant wavelength in the
