<ABSTRACT>
A method of separating and recovering Pu and Np from a 
Pu- and Np-containing nitric acid solution. The method 

comprises the steps of subjecting a nitric acid solution 
containing Pu and Np to valen
ce adjustment by adding a 
reducing agent consisting of hydroxylamine nitrate and 

hydrazine to said nitric acid solution so as to reduce Pu 
and Np in said nitric acid solution to Pu (III) and Np (IV), 

respectively; adjusting a nitric acid concentration of said 
nitric acid solution after said valence adjustment to 6 to 8 

M; bringing said nitric acid solution after said nitric acid 
concentration adjustment into contact with a strong basic 

anion exchange resin so as to cause Np to be selectively 
adsorbed by said resin and to separate and recover Pu as a 

plutonium nitrate solution; and eluting said adsorbed Np 
(IV) by using diluted nitric acid of 1 M or below so as to 

recover Np as a neptunium nitrate solution. The valence 
adjustment step may be carried out by subjecting the Pu- and 

Np-containing nitric acid solution to electrolytic reduction 
instead of using the reducing agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of efficiently separating 
and recovering Pu (plutonium) and Np (neptunium) from 
a nitric acid solution containing Pu and Np. A method of the present invention can be advantageously 
utilized when Pu and Np are separated and recovered from a 
Pu- and Np-containing nitric acid solution generated from, 
for example, scrap recovery/refining steps, etc, in spent 
nuclear fuel reprocessing and a nuclear fuel production, and 
further, when Np is separated and recovered from high level 
radioactive waste. Np is an artificial radioactive element that does not 
exist in nature and is contained together with Pu in spent 
nuclear fuel as transuranic element produced by neutron 
irradiation to U (uranium)-238. The transuranic elements 
other than Pu in spent nuclear fuel in currently-operated 
light-water reactors are mainly Am (americium) and Np. The transuranium elements containing Np are processed and 
disposed of as high level radioactive wastes produced from 
spent nuclear fuel reprocessing. So-called "formation 
disposal", i.e., burying them in a deep stratum, has been 
examined. The problem with this formation disposal is that  
 
millions of years are necessary in order to reduce the risk 
of the transuranic elements to the level of that of natural 
uranium. Among the transuranium elements, Np is particularly 
a nuclide having a long lifetime. Therefore, the risk at 
the time of processing and disposal of high level radioactive 
wastes can be reduced by separating and removing Np 
from the high level radioactive wastes. In reprocessing spent nuclear fuel, U and Pu are recovered, 
using an extraction solvent such as tributyl 
phosphate, from a nitric acid solution prepared by dissolving 
spent nuclear fuel in nitric acid and containing U, Pu, 
Np, etc. However, separation of Np from Pu and U is difficult 
because the extraction behavior of Np is analogous to 
those of U and Pu and furthermore, the valences of Np are 
four, five and six in nitric acid solution and change 
complicatedly. To separate Np from Pu and U by a solvent extraction 
method, it has been general to add divalent iron (Fe(II)) to 
the solution to prevent complicated change of valence of Np 
and to control the valence of Np constant in the solution. However, when the solvent extraction method described 
above is used as a method of separating Np, the extraction 
solvent used deteriorates, so that disposal of the deteriorated 
waste solvent becomes a new problem. Further, 
because Fe (II) added as the
