<ABSTRACT>
A tilting device for a direct current arc furnace and a process are disclosed for completely emptying the furnace while the furnace is operated with continuous scrap supply through a lateral opening (15) in the furnace vessel (1) and removal of bottoms. The scrap chute (14) should remain in the opening (15) of the furnace during the whole continuous loading, melting, deslagging and steel tapping operations; it should be swivelled away only for completly emptying the furnace. The disclosed tilting device has a cam (10) on the rolling cradle (4), so that the rolling mid-point (5a) remains at the zero position in a tilting range from +/- 5 DEG  and +/- 15 DEG , and only when the furnace is completely emptied it moves to another position (5b) in a parallel direction to the bottom tap opening (2a). The position of the bottom tap opening (2b, 2c) should change only to an insignificant extent in a tilting range of for example + 10 DEG  (tapping of steel) and a tilting range of up to + 25 DEG  (tapping of bottom), in order to protect the parts of the bottom electrode (13) located outside the vessel (1) of the furnace from the heat radiated by the steel in the steel casting ladle (11).

Tilting device for a direct current arc 
furnace with an eccentric base taphole and the 

electrodes of which cooperate with the tilting 
movement, the furnace vessel of which has a side 

aperture and a device for the continuous 
introduction of scrap, wherein the tilting device 

consists of roller cradles which are located below 
the vessel frame, which are mounted on running 

rollers which are fixed in a secure manner to the 
foundation plate of the vessel foundation and 

which can be moved by means of hydraulic 
mechanical drives,
 
characterised in that 


the roller cradles (4) are provided at their 
lower side with a cam (10); 
the roller cradles (4) have, at their points of 
abutment on the running rollers (6a,6b), when the 

furnace vessel is in a tilting range, out of the 
+
 
0 ° position, of between ± 5 ° and ± 15 °, the form 

of an arc, the radius of which extends from the 
roll centre (5) of the furnace vessel (1); 
and in that, outside the tilting range, the 
arcuate shape of the roller cradles (4) merges in  

 
the vicinity of the cam (10) into a straight line 

(10a), the inclination of which to the arcuate 
tangent of the roller cradle (4) is selected such 

that during the rolling of the roller cradle (4) 
by the tilting cylinder (9) via the cams (10) the 

position of the base taphole (2) of the furnace 
vessel (1) does not alter, or only alters 

slightly. 
Tilting device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the cam (10) has, where the 

arc of the roller cradles (4) merges into the 
straight line (10a), a transfer radius (10b) which 

is from 1.1 to 3.0 times the radius of the running 
rollers (6a,6b). 
Tilting device for a direct current arc 
furnace with an eccentric base taphole, and the 

electrodes of which participate in the tilting 
movement, the furnace vessel of which has a 

lateral aperture and a device for the continuous 
introduction of scrap, wherein the tilting device 

consists of roller cradles which are disposed 
below the vessel frame, which are mounted on 

running rollers which are mounted securely on the 
foundation plate of the vessel foundation and 

which can be moved by means of hydraulic 
mechanical drives;
  
 

characterised in that 

the roller cradles (4) are provided at 
their lower side with a cam (10); 
the roller cradles (4) have, at their 
points of abutment on the running rollers (6a,6b), 

when the furnace vessel is in a tilting range, out 
of the 
+
 0 ° position, of between 
+
 5 ° and ± 15 °, 
the form of an arc, the radius of which extends 

from the roll centre (5) of the furnace vessel 
(1); 
 
   - and in that the tilting range of the arc 

of the roller cradles (4) merges, in the vicinity 
of the cam (10) into a concave or convex or 

parabolic arc, which is selected such that when 
rolling the roller cradles (4) by means of the 

tilting cylinder (9) via the cam (10), the 
position of the base taphole (2) of the furnace 

vessel (1) does not alter at all, or only alters 
slightly. 
Process for emptying a direct current arc 
furnace, provided with a tilting device according 

to Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that, when the 
melt is tapped, the furnace vessel (1) is tilted 

out of the 
+
 0 ° position into a tilting range of 
from 
+
 5 ° to 
+
 15 ° about a fixed roll centre (5) 
and the base taphole (2) thus displaces its 

position into the + 10 ° tilting position (2b) or +  
 

25 ° tilting position (2c) and in that, when this 
tilting range is exceeded, wherein the scrap chute 

(14) is drawn out of the furnace vessel (1), the 
base taphole (2) displaces its position from the + 

10 ° tilting position (2b) into the + 25 ° tilting 
position (2c), whereas the roll centre (5) may 

travel from the 
+
 0 ° position (5a) into the + 25 ° 
position (5b).
