<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the frame design of a vehicle door, in particular motor vehicle door, which comprises a supporting door frame forming a door-supporting module and having at least one front and one rear and one upper frame part, and has a window lifter for opening and closing a window pane as well as parts serving for the guidance of the window pane and further door elements. The essence of the invention lies in the fact that the guiding mechanism for the window pane is integrated into a window frame part and into the rear frame part of the door frame.
