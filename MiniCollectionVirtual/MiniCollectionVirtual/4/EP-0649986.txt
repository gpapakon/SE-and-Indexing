<ABSTRACT>
A unified fuel pump assembly combines a vane-type 
pump and a booster stage for the inlet of the 

vane-type pump, in a unitary structure to 
substantially reduce "windage" losses caused by 

relatively moving parts. The unified structure 
also includes an electric motor subassembly to 

provide motive power, and a liquid ring pump, which 
helps to process air bubbles through the fuel pump, 

is coupled to the electric motor rotor to further 
avoid "windage" losses. The vane type pump relies 

on the use of a central shaft capable of having a 
substantially uniform and relatively large diameter 

from end to end.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to fuel pumps
for combustion engines and more specifically
relates to fuel pump assemblies having a vane type
pump for supplying fuel to an engine in combination
with a dynamic booster pump for delivering fuel
from a supply source such as a fuel tank, to the
inlet of the vane pump.Rotary vane type fuel pumps are well known in
the aircraft engine art. In the past, design
considerations and limitations have required such
pumps to include axial shafts having journal ends
of relatively small diameter. In this context, the
term relatively small refers generally to the
diameter of the journal ends of the shaft which are
supported by rotary bearings, relative to the
central rotor portion of the shaft. For example in
vane pumps of known design, if the diameter of the
rotor portion was specified as D, it would be
necessary, in general, to limit the diameter of the
journal end to not more than D - 2 x (depth of the
vane slot + 0.1). The term journal end refers to
the portion of the rotary shaft that is supported
by rotary bearings; it will be understood in this
regard that such portion of the shaft need not 
necessarily be located at the extreme end of the
shaft.In U.S. Patent No. 5 545 014,
there is
disclosed a new type of variable displacement vane
pump in which the diameter of the rotary shaft is
made significantly greater than it was in vane
pumps of the prior art and which can be
substantially uniform in diameter from end to end.
Specifically, in the new type of vane pump there
disclosed, it is possible for the bearing support
portions of the shaft, i.e. the journal ends, to be
of substantially the same diameter as the main,
vane-supporting portion of the shaft. The present
invention relates to this new type of vane pump and
the specification of the U.S. Patent No. 5 545 014 is,
accordingly, referred to expressly and incorporated
by reference herein.Limitations inherent in the design of some
aircraft, result in the delivery of fuel at
relatively low pressure to the inlet of the vane
pump or vane pumps that are used as the main source
of fuel pressure for the aircraft engines. To meet
the requirements for high output pressure to supply
the engines, while overcoming the limitations of
low inlet pressure coming from the fuel supply 
reservoir, the practice of using inlet pressure
booster pumps has been developed.In the past, the main engine vane pumps and
the booster pumps used to supply the vane pump
inlets have been separate and distinct devices. A
significant disadvantage of
