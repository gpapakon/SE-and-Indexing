<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a binder composition for powder coatings for use as a top coat in the automotive industry. The invention also relates to top-coated automotive substrates. The binder composition includes a polyester containing hydroxyl groups and a polyacrylate containing hydroxyl groups and a blocked hexamethylenediisocyanate trimer. The polyester has a hydroxyl number of between 20 and 100 mg KOH/g resin and an acid number of less than 10 mg KOH/g resin and the polyacrylate has a hydroxyl number of between 40 and 150 mg KOH/g resin and an acid number of less than 20 mg KOH/g resin. The trimer is blocked with 1,2,4-triazole.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of a binder 
composition for the preparation of a powder coating for use a 
top coat in the automotive industry. The invention also 
concerns top-coated automotive substrates. The top coat or finish coat is the coating intended 
to be the last coat applied in a coating system and is usually 
applied over a primer, a basecoat or surfaces. The clear top coats which, according to the present 
state of the art in the automotive industry, are used as a 
two-component system are solvent-containing paint systems 
based on acrylate resins cured with isocyanates. In order to 
meet the requirements regarding the reduction in solvent 
emissions, so-called high-solids systems are already being 
used. The only way to reduce solvent emissions still further 
is to use powder coatings for clear automotive coatings 
(Lattke, E. "Pulverlack am Auto; Aus der Sicht der 
Autoindustrie", presented at "Der Pulvertreff '92, 23.01.92, 
München"; JOT-Veranstaltungen, pages 1-11). The same requirements will be made of powder coating 
systems for said application as of the solvent-containing 
systems. These requirements concern for instance flow, 
chemical resistance, gloss and outdoor durability (Kinza, W. 
"Pulverklarlack für die Karosseriebeschichtung", presented at 
"Die EPS-Praxis 1991, 25.11.91, Bad Neuheim"; Schriftenreihe 
Praxis-Forum, Fachbrochure Oberflachentechnik 27/91, pages 
49-55). The aim is to obtain these properties at a curing 
temperature of less than 150 °C. There are no systems known 
amongst the present powder resin systems which meet the 
combination of properties required.  
 There are several properties which can be obtained with 
systems based on an acid-epoxy curing reaction, but the 
required combination of good flow, good chemical resistance, 
high gloss, high scratch resistance, good mechanical 
properties and good outdoor durability has never yet been 
obtained with powder coatings. With systems based on polymers 
containing hydroxyl groups and curing agents containing 
blocked isocyanate groups, too, several of the above-mentioned 
properties can be obtained. The usual temperature (above 
170°C) at which these systems must be cured is, however, much 
too high for application as a (clear) topcoat for automotive 
applications. It is the object of the present invention to provide 
a binder composition which can be cured at relatively low 
temperatures and which, moreover, gives a combination of the 
desired properties. The powder coating have to result in a 
clear top
