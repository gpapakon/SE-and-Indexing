<ABSTRACT>
A heat-resistant carbonate and/or bicarbonate-iron-lactoferrin combination wherein at least 15 iron molecules 
are bo
nded to one lactoferrin molecule via carbonate and/or bicarbonate. The production process comprises adding an 
alkali carbonate and/or bicarbonate to a solution containing a lactoferrin and an iron salt having a pH value of 4 or 

less when dissolved in water to thereby adjust the pH value to 7 or less, or adding a solution containing an iron salt 
and a lactoferrin to a solution containing a carbonate and/or bicarbonate, or adding an iron salt or a solution thereof 

to a solution containing a carbonate and/or a bicarbonate and further a lactoferrin. The combination has a high heat 
resistance and is useful as the starting material of food, drug, feed, cosmetic, and so forth.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermally stable and heat
resistant iron lactoferrin complexes bound with a large
quantity of iron and preparation thereof.The heat resistant lactoferrin complexes of the present
invention contain a large quantity of iron, show no iron
specific astringent taste, and prevent the acceleration of
peroxide formation by iron. Thus, the complexes are useful
as raw materials of foods, medicines, feeds, cosmetics and
so forth for the prevention and treatment of anemia, the
enrichment of iron content, or the prevention of the
infection by pathogenic microorganisms.Various physiological activities of lactoferrin
(hereinafter abbreviated as Lf) such as acceleration of iron
absorption, prevention of lipoperoxide formation,
antibacterial and antiviral activity, cell proliferation,
and control of immune system have been known. Therefore, Lf
has been tried for the production of foods, medicines, feeds
and cosmetics. These products are generally pasteurized
thermally, or treated with boiled water before use. 
However, Lf has an essential drawback of instability against
heat. Heat treatment causes precipitates due to thermal
denaturation, and loses iron binding property which leads to
physiologically inactive state. Investigation for the
stabilization of Lf against heat was carried out and found
that heating at pH 4 does not affect the binding property of
Lf to iron (Davidson and Lonnerdal. Am. J. Physiol., 257:
G930-G934, 1989). However, heat treated Lf at pH 4
gradually degenerates and loses its physiological
properties. Additionally, heating of Lf under low ionic
strength maintained its physiological activity (Japanese
Laid-open Patent Application No. 108629/1992). However,
practical ionic strength in commonly used products are not
necessarily low. The relative effect on heat stability of
Lf to pH and electric conductivity, Ω, was investigated to
develop a method for heat resistance of Lf and found to
stabilize Lf solutions against heat by adjusting log Ω to
satisfy the following equations (Japanese Laid-open Patent
Application No. 8269/1992).
log Ω ≦ (2.96/pH) + 0.64 (pH<5)log Ω ≦ (29.37/pH) - 4.62 (5≦pH≦7.9)log Ω ≦ -0.917 (pH>7.9)
Lf solutions out of the above mentioned ranges require
separate pasteurization of Lf solutions and the other raw
material solutions followed by aseptic mixing of the
pasteurized solutions. Japanese Regulations demand single 
pasteurization by heating after mixing, and does not allow
separate pasteurization and mixing.The inventors have been investigating to solve
