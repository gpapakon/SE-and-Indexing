A weighing device (8) for the point-of-sale of a retail 
outlet having a scales stand (11), having a load plate 

(16) for receiving an article to be weighed, having a 
support (15) supporting the load plate, having a through-window 

(17) in the load plate and in the support, having 
a radiolucent plate (18) covering the window, having a 

reading device (14) disposed beneath the plate on the 
scales stand to detect codes on the article, having a 

weighing cell loaded by the support (15), having an 
electronic evaluation circuit (13) for determining the 

weight of the article and its price, and having a display 
(4) for displaying the weight and the price of the 

article,
characterised in that
just a single weighing cell (12) is provided and as 
far as possible is disposed laterally offset in 

stationary manner on the scales stand (11); 
the support (15) is constructed to be intrinsically 
rigid and in the vicinity of its one edge is rigidly 

connected with the weighing cell (12) so that its 
window (17) is held cantilevered over the scales 

stand (11); 
on the scales stand (11) the reading device (14) 
lies on the one side and the electronic evaluation 

circuit (13) lies on the other side of the weighing 
cell (12) and 
the electronic evaluation circuit (13) with 
microcomputer (24) and digitiser (23) performs an 

automatic weight determination and price calculation 
of the weighed article. 
A weighing device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the weighing cell (12) is 
constructed as a bending bar. 
A weighing device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the edges of the load plate (16) 
can be sensed by sensors (31), which detect an article 

incorrectly laid on the load plate, i.e. protruding over 
its edges. 
A weighing device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the reading device (14) is a 
scanner or a CCD camera. 
A weighing device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the load plate (16) lies on the 
rigid support (15) via four damping components (28). 
A weighing device according to Claim 5,
characterised in that
 the damping components (28) 
simultaneously serve for the lateral attachment of the 

load plate (16) to the rigid support (15). 
A weighing device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 at least one hydraulic damper is 
disposed at the free edge of the rigid support (15). 
A weighing device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the electronic evaluation circuit 
(13) filters out spurious oscillation acting on the load 

plate (16). 
A weighing device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 it is disposed sunk in a cash desk 
(1) and the load plate (16) slightly protrudes over the 

cash desk (1) in the unladen state.  
 
A weighing device according to Claim 9,
characterised in that
 a lifting device for raising 
the load plate over the cash desk is disposed 

between the rigid support (15) and the load plate 
(16). 
A weighing device according to Claim 3 and 10,
characterised in that
 the sensors (31) are 
inactivated when the lifting device is operated. 
A weighing device according to Claim 3,
characterised in that
 the electronic evaluation 
circuit (13) only enables the display (4) if the 

load plate (16) is loaded and none of the sensors 
(31) supplies a error signal within a preselected 

period.
