Method for controlling the flue gas
temperature at the outlet of a steam generator having a

heating surface (5) which can be used for heat transfer
between the flue gas (R) and the supply water (S),

wherein the cooled flue gas (R) is cleaned upon
emerging from the steam generator, 
characterised in
that
 the heating surface (5), which is used effectively
in each case for the heat transfer, is altered as a

function of the flue gas temperature (T
i
), wherein in
the event of the flue gas temperature (T
i
) deviating
from a desired value (T
s
) above the minimum acceptable
flue gas temperature for the cleaning of the flue gas,

sections (20, 21, 22) of the heating surface (5), which
sections are arranged one after the other in the flow

direction of the supply water (S), are switched on or
off.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 in the event of the flue gas temperature (T
i
)
falling when supply water (S) is flowing in the

opposite direction to the flow of flue gas, the section
(20) of the heating surface (5) that is nearest to the

outlet of the steam generator (1) is switched off first
of all.
Device for adjusting the flue gas temperature
(T
i
) at the outlet of a steam generator (1),
subsequently connected to the flue-gas side of which is

a flue gas cleaning unit (7), with the steam generator
(1) having a heating surface (5) which can be used for

heat transfer between the flue gas (R) and the supply
water (S), with the heating surface (5) being divided

into a number of sections (20, 21, 22), each of which
sections (20, 21, 22) can be switched on or off

individually, 
characterised in that
 a temperature
sensor (13) is provided to measure the flue gas

temperature (T
i
) at the outlet of the steam generator 
(1), and 
in that
 a controller (14) is provided so that
the heating surface (5)-, which is used by the flowing

supply water (S), can be controlled as a function of
the flue gas temperature (T
i
).
Device according to claim 3, 
characterised in
that
 the sections (20, 21, 22) are arranged one after
the other in the flow direction of the flue gas (R),

and the supply water (S) can flow through said sections
one after the other in the opposite direction, with

each section (20, 21, 22) being connected on the input
side to a final control element (15a, 15b, 15c).
Device according to claim 4, 
characterised in
that
 at the inlet each section (20, 21, 22) has an
inlet collector (23, 24 and 25 respectively) for

collecting supply water (S).
Device according to claim 4 or 5,

characterised by
 a controller (14), which is connected
on the output side to at least one final control

element (15) and the input quantity of which is the

actual value of the flue gas temperature (T
i
).
