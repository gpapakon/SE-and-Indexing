<ABSTRACT>
Described is a process for the preparation of halides and salts of carboxylic acids by the reaction of metal halides or "onium" halides with carboxylic anhydrides. The process is highly suitable for processing anhydrous spent catalyst preparations. The halide or salt of a carboxylic acid which has been prepared can be used as acylating reagent or alkylating reagent. Metal halide or "onium" halide liberated in this process can be regenerated by re-reacting with carboxylic anhydride. This allows hydrolysis-free alkylation of acylation to be effected without obtaining salt-type waste products. If the mixture of halide and salt of carboxylic acid is reacted with an alcohol, preferably in situ, the resulting esters may be isolated without hydrolysis.
