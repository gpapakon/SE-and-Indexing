<ABSTRACT>
A method for insulation and external covering of a construction employs metal angle plates (2) of the type comprising a vertical wing (21) fixed to the wall of the construction (1) by any appropriate means, such as screwing, and a horizontal wing (22). The horizontal wing (22) has, on its upper face, uniformly spaced blades (23) which are formed by punching and which cover substantially rectangular cuttings (20), and has, on its lower face, spikes (24) to prevent sliding. Insulating elements (3) are placed between the horizontally arranged angle plates (2) and are joined to each other and to the angle plates (2) by injection of binder.
