<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention resides in a method and an apparatus for
forming a molded plastic article, as plastic closures,
particularly threaded molded articles, and particularly for
removing said article from the mold.The art of injection molding plastic closures is well
known in the industry. Dependant upon the design of the
plastic closure, including the thread type and number of
complete threads, it may be ejected from the mold in a
variety of ways. If the plastic material being molded is
flexible or resilient it may be stripped by a commonly known
stripper ring pushing the article off the core. The molded
part must be solidified enough not to be folded over onto
itself during ejection but sufficiently elastic to return to
essentially its original molded shape after the threads have
been stretched over the core. If the molded material does
not possess the appropriate characteristics of flexibility
for this most economical and simple method of ejection, the
article will be damaged or may not return to its original
shape and size. Similarly, a very defined or deep thread
profile may be inherently prone to stripping damage. Also,
the part may have other delicate or fragile features such as
a commonly known tamper evident ring, which could be damaged
even if an otherwise acceptable plastic is being injection
molded. For such situations where the molded part will be too
rigid or fragile to simply push off the core, a collapsible
core could be used such as the type shown in U.S. Patent No.
4,130,264. This patent shows a plurality of thread forming
segments situated around the periphery of the core which
move on tracks to collapse the core inwardly, so that the
molded article can easily be pushed off.In the case of molding a cap having an integral tamper
evident ring, an alternative method is shown in U.S. Patent
No. 4,155,698. Here the first female portion of the cavity
which surrounds the threaded portion of the closure is
removed from the molded closure, while a second female
portion adjacent the tamper evident ring stays in place.
The core is then retracted while the closure stretches
elastically over it. This is possible because the closure
device is held fast by the second female portion in the
region of the tamper evident ring. The part can then be
ejected by a core pin pushing on the inside of the closure
or cap, as the inward elastic yielding of the fragile tamper
evident ring is permitted.When molding a plastic resin which is too rigid to be
stripped from the threaded portion of the cavity, without
