<ABSTRACT>
An improved BiCMOS logic circuit (70) utilizes an emitter-coupled pair of bipolar transistors (21, 22) for differentially comparing an input signal (Vin) with a logic reference level (VBIAS). Each of the bipolar transistors are resistively loaded by a network of p-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor (PMOS) transistors (26, 27) coupled in parallel. At least one of the parallel combination of transistors has its gate coupled to a control signal (VREF2) providing a variable load resistance. The control signal is preferably provided by a feedback network (52, 53) which maintains a constant voltage swing across the network over temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BiCMOS LOGIC CIRCUITRELATED APPLICATIONSThis is a continuation-in-part (CIP) application of Serial No. 693,815, filed April 30, 1991 , which application is assigned to the assignee of the present invention.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention generally relates to the field of integrated circuits which combine bipolar and complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices on the same substrate. More particularly, the invention relates to emitter-coupled-logic (ECL) logic gates implemented using a BiCMOS process technology.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONRecently, researchers have been directing their attention toward developing digital logic circuits which combine bipolar and CMOS technologies in a single integrated circuit. The marriage of bipolar and CMOS technologies is particularly advantageous since the superior aspects of each may be exploited and combined to yield optimal circuit performance.For instance, CMOS circuits have the advantages of extremely low quiescent power consumption, rail-to-rail output capability, high density and a very high input impedance. Bipolar logic circuits, on the other hand, are useful in driving large capacitance loads, have very fast switching capabilities and feature better performance over temperature and power supply. These attributes have lead to the{,SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

development of a family of BiCMOS digital logic circuits which employ bipolar transistors to drive output loads while utilizing CMOS devices to perform the basic logic functions on the received input signals. Digital logic circuits implemented using BiCMOS technology are discussed in "BiCMOS Technology and Applications", edited by Antonio R. Alvarez, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1990, Chapter 5 (pages 165-200). Examples of BiCMOS binary logic circuits are also disclosed in U.S. Patent Numbers 4,701,642; 4,871,928; 4,845,385; 4,703,203; 4,636,665; 4,779,014; and 4,808,850.Emitter-coupled logic (ECL) is a very well understood family of bipolar logic circuitry. Its popularity stems from the fact that ECL provides the faster bipolar logic available. However, the main drawback is the fact that bipolar ECL gates also consume the most power of conventional logic technologies. Thus, it would be desirable to integrate the high switching speed capabilities of conventional bipolar ECL along with the high-density, low-power characteristics of CMOS circuits. A hybrid ECL MOS family of logic circuits would be capable of taking advantage of the strengths of the individual technologies.Unfortunately, past
