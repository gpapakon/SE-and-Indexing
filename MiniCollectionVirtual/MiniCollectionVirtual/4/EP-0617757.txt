Method of regulating dwell time of ignition 
systems in internal combustion engines having a microprocessor 

for actuating at least one ignition output 
stage, the current through the ignition coil being 

detected and fed to a first input of a comparator, a 
prescribable comparison voltage being present at the 

second input of the comparator and the output level of 
the comparator being fed to the microprocessor, characterized 

in that, in the microprocessor (1), the time from 
the output start of the dwell time (T1) up to the 

triggering of the comparator (T3) is detected and evaluated 
in such a way that the detected time (T3 - T1) 

constitutes the dwell time or a defined fraction of the 
dwell time (SZ
n
) which is output to the ignition output 
stage by the microprocessor (1) for the subsequent 

ignition by means of a corresponding signal. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that at least one comparison voltage (U
v
) which is 
present at the comparator (6) can be set to a prescribed 

current value of the charge curve of the respective 
ignition coil. 
Method according to Claim 1 to 2, characterized 
in that a time (t4) for monitoring the end (T2) of the 

dwell time is started by the microprocessor (1) when the 
comparator (6) is triggered (T3), and in that a forced 

ignition is triggered by the microprocessor (1) after 
this time (t4) has expired and the end (T2) of the dwell 

time has not occurred. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that when there is a restart, starting  

 
takes place with the dwell time (SZn) determined in the 

last engine cycle provided the engine temperature (T
motn
) 
measured at the restart deviates by only a prescribable 

value from the engine temperature at the end (T
mote
) of 
operation. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that when the time determined from the 

start (T1) of the dwell time up to the triggering of the 
comparator (T3) is less a prescribed minimum dwell time 

(T
DIA
), this is interpreted as a short-circuit and the 
ignition and injection are switched off for the corresponding 

cylinder. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that at the end (T2) of the dwell time 

the microprocessor (1) interrogates the output level (IP) 
of the comparator (6) to determine whether the latter has 

been triggered, in that when the comparator has not been 
triggered and the actual dwell time (T2 - T1) is greater 

than or equal to the output dwell time (SZ), the subsequent 
dwell time (SZn) is specified by adding a correction 

value (K) to the output dwell time (SZn = T2 - T1 + 
K). 
Method according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the correction value (K) is a value which can be 

specified in application in such a way that the 
comparator is reliably triggered by this correction value 

(K). 
Method according to Claims 6 and 7, characterized 
in that the correction value (K) is incrementally added 

to the actual dwell time (T2 - T1). 
Method according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that when the comparator (6) has not been triggered 

and an actual dwell time (T2 - T1) is less than the dwell 
time (SZ) output by the microprocessor (1), the 

previously output dwell time (SZ) is output again as the 
subsequent dwell time (SZn).
