<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to substituted
pyridopyrimidines which are useful for the treatment of hypertension and congestive
heart failure.These compounds achieve their hemodynamic effects by antagonizing the effects
of angiotensin II; the active component of the renin angiotensin system. Angiotensinogen
is converted to angiotensin I by the action of the enzyme renin. Angiotensin II (A II) is
formed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) acting on angiotensin I. A II is a
powerful vasoconstrictor and is implicated as the cause of high blood pressure in a
number of species including man. A II elicits these vasopressor responses by acting at
specific receptor sites. The compounds described in this invention compete with A II for
these receptor sites, thus antagonizing the vasopressor effects of A II.R. S. Boger, in U. S. patent 5,104,877, and K. Atwal, in EP 481448 A, describe
methylbiphenyl substituted 4-aminopyrimidines. C. Hoornaert, et al. disclose
methylbiphenyl 4-pyrimidinone derivatives in EP 500409 A. A. M. Venkatesan, et al.
disclose methylbiphenyl substituted quinazolinones in EP 497150 A. A. H. Ratcliffe, et
al. disclose methylbiphenyl substituted naphthyridines in EP 516392 A2. J.R. Bantick,
et al. describe methylbiphenyl substitution products of substituted pyridinones and
pyrimidinones including 4-hydroxy-7-methyl-3-phenyl-1-((2'-[1H-tetrazol-5-yl][1,1-biphenyl]-4-yl)methyl)-1,8-naphthyridin-2(1H)-one
in EP 500297 A. E. Allen, et al.
describe substituted pyridopyrimidinones in EP 481614 A. J. W. Ellingboe, et al.
describe methylbiphenyl substituted pyridopyrimidines in U.S. patent 5,149,699. All of
the above are claimed as A II antagonists.The compounds of this invention differ from the above mentioned prior art,
except for the last reference, in that they contain a pyrimidine ring fused to a pyridinone
ring, with a methylbiphenyl group attached to the pyridinone ring. The compounds
described by E. Allen, et al. in EP 481614 A contain a pyrimidinone ring fused to a
pyridine ring, and the methylbiphenyl group is attached to the pyrimidinone ring. The
compounds of the present invention differ from those described by J. W. Ellingboe, et al.
in U. S. patent 5,149,699 in that they contain at least one hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl,
aldehyde, ketone, or carboxy group on the pyridopyrimidinone ring system. This invention relates to substituted pyridopyrimidinones of general formula (I):
