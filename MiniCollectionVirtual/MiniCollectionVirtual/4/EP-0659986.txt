<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for monitoring a secondary air system connected to the exhaust system of a motor vehicle and to an apparatus for carrying out the method. In the method according to the invention, a first variable, which describes the flow of secondary air injected into the exhaust duct (104) of the internal combustion engine (100) by the secondary air system, is determined. This first variable is used to assess the ability to function of the secondary air system. If the first variable is within a predeterminable interval, the conclusion drawn is that the secondary air system is operating properly. If, on the other hand, the first variable is outside this predeterminable interval, the conclusion is drawn that there is a fault. The first variable is determined from a second variable which describes the air flow fed to the internal combustion engine (100), from the air/fuel ratio in the mixture drawn in by the internal combustion engine (100) and from the air/fuel ratio pertaining in the exhaust duct (104) downstream of the entry of the secondary airline (118).

<CLAIMS>
Method to monitor a secondary air system in
conjunction with the exhaust gas system of a motor

vehicle, characterized in that

a signal for the secondary air flow is determined,
from


a signal for the intake air flow,
a signal for the ratio, determined by calculation,
of the intake air flow to fuel added per

unit of time,
a signal for the air/fuel ratio determined by
means of a probe (114) downstream of the opening

of a secondary air line (118) into the exhaust
gas duct (104), and in that
the operability of the secondary air flow is
assessed on the basis of the signal for the

secondary air flow, the intake air flow being the
air volume or air mass flow taken in by the

internal combustion engine (100).
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the secondary air system is assessed as operational

when the signal for the secondary air flow is applied
within a pre-determinable interval and as non-operational

when the signal is applied outside the interval, the
interval being pre-determinable as a function of the

operating state of the internal combustion engine (100).
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that, to determine the signal for the

secondary air flow the deviation of the quotient from the
air/fuel ratio downstream of the opening of the secondary

air line (118) into the exhaust gas duct (104) and the 
ratio, determined by calculation, of the intake air flow

to fuel added per unit of time from the value 1 is
multiplied by the intake air flow.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the signal for the intake air flow

is generated by an air mass meter or air volume meter or
is formed from a signal for the load and a signal for the

rotational speed.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the signal for the intake air flow

and/or the signal for the ratio, determined by calculation,
of the intake air flow to fuel added per unit of

time and/or the signal for the air/fuel ratio downstream
of the opening of a secondary air line (118) into the

exhaust gas duct (104) is averaged over a predeterminable
interval of time.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the operability of the secondary

air system is verified whenever the secondary air pump
(120) is switche
d on in any case, in particular in the
warm-up phase of the internal combustion engine (100).
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the operability of the secondary

air system is verified when a probe (114) is ready for
operation to determine the air/fuel ratio.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the operability of the secondary

air system is verified when a Lambda control is switched
off in controlled operation.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized
in that the Lambda control is switched on as soon

as a condition is met in-relation to the time since the
internal combustion engine (100) was started, in relation

to the temperature of the catalytic converter (116)
measured or determined by a model, in relation to the

integrated air mass or injected fuel mass since the
internal combustion engine (100) was started or in

relation to the number of crankshaft revolutions since
the internal combustion engine (100) was started, and in 

that the operability of the secondary air system is
verified when the Lambda control is switched on.
Apparatus for monitoring a secondary air system
in conjunction with the exhaust gas system of a motor

vehicle in accordance with the method according to Claim
1, characterized by


first means (106) for generating a signal for the
intake air flow,
second means for generating a signal for the
ratio, determined by calculation, of the intake

air flow to fuel added per unit of time,
third means (114) for generating a signal for the
air/fuel ratio downstream of the opening of a

secondary air line (118) into the exhaust gas
duct (104) and

the first, second and third means (114),
fifth means for assessing the operability of the
secondary air system based on the signal generated

by the fourth means,

mass flow taken in by the internal combustion

engine (100).
