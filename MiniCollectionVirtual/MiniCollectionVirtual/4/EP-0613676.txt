<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to nail enamels, also 
known as nail lacquers. Nail enamels conventionally comprise a film forming 
component, which is frequently nitrocellulose, cellulose 
acetate butyrate, or a combination of one or both of those 
cellulosics with a polyurethane or other polymeric compound. 
Nail enamels have also traditionally included plasticizers, 
typically a phthalate such as dibutyl phthalate, or camphor, 
and have also typically included as a plasticizer and.or 
adhesion promoter a polymeric component formed by 
condensation polymerization of formaldehyde or other 
aldehyde, typically an aromatic sulfonamide-aldehyde 
condensation resin such as o, p-toluene sulfonamide 
formaldehyde resin. In Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 9, No. 130, 
dated June 5, 1985, there is disclosed in the abstract of 
Kokai 60-16910 a nail enamel containing 5-25 wt.% 
nitrocellulose, 3-15% resin (e.g. alkyd resin), 2-8% 
plasticizer (e.g. acetyl tribenzyl citrate), 60-85% solvent 
(e.g. ethyl acetate) and 1-10%, preferably 4-6% silica 
having an average particle diameter of 0.01-30 µ, preferably 
0.5-10 µ. Use of acetyl triethyl citrate as an optional 
supplemental plasticizer in a nail enamel composition is 
disclosed in FR-A-2397186. Citric acid derivatives are 
mentioned as plasticizers in EP-A-0170000. It is desirable that a nail enamel contain reduced 
amounts of phthalates and aldehyde (e.g. formaldehyde) 
condensation products, in order to alleviate concerns that 
some wearers may be sensitized to phthalate or uncondensed 
aldehyde in the nail enamel. It is also desirable to 
reduce or eliminate volatile components such as camphor, 
since the volatility leads to loss of the component which  
 
causes variability in the performance of the nail enamel. 
However, attempts to formulate such nail enamels have 
encountered difficulties because the nail enamel's desired 
properties such as long wear, high gloss, resistance to 
chipping on the nail, and compatibility with other nail 
enamel ingredients, are sensitive to changes in the 
ingredients in the nail enamel and to changes in the amounts 
of those ingredients. Therefore, there is still a need for 
a nail enamel formulation exhibiting satisfactory properties 
and containing little or not phthalate and.or aldehyde 
condensation products. Briefly stated, the present invention is a nail 
enamel comprising a film forming component, a solvent 
component, and a plasticizer component, wherein the 
plasticizer component is present in an amount of from
