<ABSTRACT>
A method for manufacturing a pozzolanic material from 
paper sludge, e.g. derived from the manufacture of recycled 

paper, in a plant which comprises at least a drying and 
comminuting apparatus (1) and a kiln system (3). The paper 

sludge is introduced into a stream of hot exit gas from the 
kiln system (3) of the plant, conducted together with this 

gas to the drying and comminuting apparatus (1) and 
subsequently passed, suspended in the exit gas, to a 

separator (13). The separated, dry paper material is fed 
into the burning chamber (21) of the kiln system (3), 

and the organic matter of the material is incinerated with 
the development of heat, by means of which the mineral 

residue, primarily kaolin, is subjected to heat treatment. 
The heat-treated mineral material is eventually cooled in 

a cooler (25). 
In this way the kaolinic, inorganic fraction of the 
paper sludge is transformed in an economic and 

environmentally acceptable manner into a material with 
pozzolanic properties, which can be utilized as an additive 

in the preparation of e.g. concrete, which will thereby 
obtain enhanced strength characteristics and increased 

density.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
manufacturing a pozzolanic material from paper sludge, for 
example derived from the manufacture of recycled paper, in 
a plant comprising a drying and comminuting apparatus and 
a kiln system. In this context, a pozzolanic material is taken to 
mean a material of oxides such as Al2O3, Fe2O3, SiO2, 
which when incorporated into mortar or concrete may 
react with Ca(OH)2 with the formation of minerals 
equivalent to those formed when ordinary cement minerals 
react with water. The two most important cement minerals 
(CaO)3SiO2 and (CaO)2SiO2 both react with water with 
formation of tobermorite-gel and Ca(OH)2. When a 
pozzolanic material is incorporated into concrete, it is 
possible to reduce the consumption of cement quite 
substantially because of these factors, if attainment of 
the same strength characteristics is desired. The manufacture of recycled paper based on the use of 
waste paper as the chief raw material generates large 
quantities of waste in the form of paper sludge. This 
paper sludge consists mainly of cellulosic fibres, printing 
ink, water and a mineral residue of paper fillers, and it 
is thought to be biodegradable. Nevertheless, the method 
of deposit which has been employed in the past, involving 
simple ploughing in of the paper sludge, is a matter of 
growing concern. Therefore, the emergence of paper sludge 
generated during the manufacture of recycled paper 
precludes utilization of the entire amount of recovered 
waste paper, which is undesirable, since from an ecological 
viewpoint it is preferable to manufacture paper from 
reclaimed material instead of from wood pulp. Several methods have been proposed for utilizing paper 
sludge in the manufacture of cement in such a way that the 
cellulosic fibres and the printing ink are incinerated in 
the kiln system of the cement plant, whereas the mineral 
content is mixed into the cement clinker in the same manner  
 
as coal ash. In, for example, Japanese laid open patent 
application JP-A-56100222, a method is disclosed according 
to which the paper sludge is initially dehydrated by 
mechanical means, the produced sludge is subsequently dried 
and granulated, and the granulate is eventually used as a 
fuel in a cement kiln. In Danish laid open patent 
application No. 2829/90 filed on November 29, 1990, a 
method is suggested by which the paper sludge is mixed into 
the cement raw materials in a suspension which is 
subsequently passed to a rotary kiln operating according to 
the

<CLAIMS>
A method for manufacturing a pozzolanic material from 
paper sludge in a plant comprising a drying and comminuting 

apparatus (1) and a kiln system (3), wherein 
the paper sludge is introduced into a stream of hot exit 

gas from the kiln system (3) of the plant and is passed 
together with the gas to the drying and comminuting 

apparatus (1) wherefrom dried and finely divided paper 
material is passed suspended in the exit gas to a separator 

(13) in which the paper material is separated from the exit 
gas; in that the separated, dry paper material is fed into 

a burning chamber (21, 31) of the kiln system (3) where the 
organic matter of the material is incinerated with the 

development of heat, by means of which the mineral residue 
is subjected to heat treatment for an appropriate period of 

time and at a controlled temperature of up to between 700 and 850Â°C; 
and in that the 

heat-treated mineral material is eventually cooled in a 
cooler (25, 35). 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the dry paper 
material is conducted from the separator (13) to a storage 

vessel (15) from which it is extracted and fed into the 
burning chamber (21, 31) of the kiln system (3). 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the 
dry paper material is fed via a burner installation (17) 

into a rotary kiln (21) forming the burning chamber of the 
kiln system where the organic matter of the material is 

incinerated to produce a flame; the mineral residue is 
precipitated in the rotary kiln (21); the exit gas produced 

during the incineration is passed to a dust separator (23)
