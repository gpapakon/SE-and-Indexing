<ABSTRACT>
Precise alignment between two or more nozzle plates 
(52) affixed to print cartridges (24, 25, 26, 27) 

installed in a single carriage (30) of an ink printer is 
achieved by machining datum projections (58, 100, 102) on 

each print cartridge (24-27) after its nozzle plate (52) 
has been permanently secured to the print cartridge (24-27). 

The machined datum projections (58, 100, 102) on the 
print cartridge (24-27) contact surfaces (76) on the 

carriage (30) when the print cartridge (24-27) is 
installed in the carriage (30) such that the dimensions of 

the datums (58, 100, 102) affect the position of the 
cartridge, and hence the nozzle plate (52), within the 

carriage (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to ink-jet
printers, and more particularly, to the alignment of
multiple nozzle members installed in an ink-jet printer.Ink-jet printheads operate by ejecting a
droplet of ink through a nozzle and onto a recording
medium, such as a sheet of paper. When a number of
nozzles are arranged in a pattern, such as one or more
linear arrays, the properly sequenced ejection of ink
from each nozzle causes characters or other images to be
printed on the paper as the printhead is moved relative
to the paper. The paper is typically shifted each time
the printhead has moved across the paper. The printhead
is usually part of a disposable print cartridge
containing a supply of ink, where the print cartridge is
easily installed in and removed from the printer. In one design of a thermal ink-jet print cartridge,
the print cartridge includes: 1) an ink reservoir and ink
channels to supply ink proximate to each of the nozzles;
2) a nozzle plate in which the nozzles are formed in a
certain pattern; and 3) a substrate attached to a bottom
surface of the nozzle plate, where a series of thin film
heaters are formed on the substrate, generally one below
each nozzle. Each heater includes a thin film resistor
and appropriate current leads. To print a single dot of
ink, an electrical current from an external power supply
is passed through a selected heater. The heater is
ohmically heated, in turn superheating a thin layer of the
adjacent ink. This results in explosive vaporization of
the ink causing a droplet of ink to be ejected through an
associated nozzle onto the paper.One example of this type of print cartridge is shown
in Fig. 1 as print cartridge 10. Print cartridge 10
generally includes a body 12 which acts as an ink
reservoir. Body 12 may have formed on it one or more
projections, such as projection 13, to enable print
cartridge 10 to be secured in place within an ink printer.
The printhead portion 14 of print cartridge 10 includes a
metal nozzle plate 16 (such as a gold-coated nickel
plate), which has two parallel arrays of nozzles 17 formed
in it using conventional photolithographic techniques.
Nozzle plate 16 is attached by an adhesive to an
underlying substrate (not shown) which includes heater
resistors paired with each of the nozzles 17.A flexible insulating tape 18 has formed on it a
number of conductors which terminate in contact pads 20.
The other ends of the conductors on tape 18 are connected,
using tape automated bonding (TAB), to electrodes on the
substrate.When print

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for use in a printer, said apparatus including first
and second print cartridges (24, 25), each having a print cartridge body

(106) and a nozzle member (52, 53) having a pattern of orifices (161)
formed therein, each of the nozzle members (52, 53) being secured to a

respective print cartridge body (106), and a scanning carriage (30)
supporting said first and second print cartridges (24, 25), the apparatus

characterized by:

said nozzle members (52, 53) of said first and second print
cartridges (24, 25) each having a reference target (T1, T2)

formed thereon, each of said nozzle members (52, 53) being
secured to a respective print cartridge body (106) so as to have a

fixed position relative to said body (106), said nozzle member
(52) of said first print cartridge (24) being misaligned with

respect to said first print cartridge body (106) by greater than a
first tolerance, said nozzle member (53) of said second print

cartridge (25) being misaligned with respect to said second print
cartridge body (106); and
one or more datums (58, 100, 102) formed on each of said first
and second print cartridge bodies (106) and contacting portions of

said scanning carriage, each of said one or more datums of said
first and second print cartridge bodies (106) having geometries

such that said one or more datums align said nozzle members (52,
53) in a predetermined manner with respect to each other, when

said first and second print cartridges (24, 25) are installed in said
scanning carriage, to within a predetermined second tolerance,

wherein said first tolerance is greater than said second tolerance,
such that said geometries of said one or more datums render

irrelevant said misalignment of said nozzle members (52, 53) with
respect to said print cartridge bodies when said first and second

print cartridges (24, 25) are installed in said carriage.
The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein said one or more datums (58,
100, 102) of each of said first and second print cartridge bodies (106)

project out from said print cartridge bodies (106), said one or more
datums having a height dimension, wherein said height dimension of any

of said one or more datums is based upon a magnitude of misalignment
of said nozzle member (52, 53) with respect to a respective one of said

first and second print cartridge bodies (106).
The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein said one or more datums (58,
100,102) of each of said print cartridge bodies (106) comprise a first

datum (58) for affecting a position of each of said respective print
cartridges (24, 25) along a first axis when installed in said carriage (30)

and a second datum (100) affecting said position of said respective print
cartridges (24, 25) in said carriage along a second axis.
The apparatus of Claim 3 further comprising a third datum (102)
for each of said first and second print cartridge bodies (106) for

correcting a skew of a respective one of said first and second print
cartridges (24, 25) when installed in said carriage (30), wherein

dimensions of said first, second, and third datums on each of said print
cartridges (24, 25) affect a position of each of said nozzle members (52,

53) with respect to said carriage (30) when said print cartridge (24) is
installed in said carriage (30).
The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein said dimension of any of said
one or more datums (58, 100, 102) is based upon a comparison of one

or more target marks (T1, T2) on said nozzle members (52, 53) with
respect to a reference position.
