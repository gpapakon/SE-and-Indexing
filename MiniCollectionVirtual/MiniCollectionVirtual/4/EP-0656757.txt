<ABSTRACT>
A sample/trial size package for cosmetic stick-form products, such as deodorants. The package is especially adapted for use with the fill/invert method of manufacture. The product is secured within the package in a fixed position throughout its use. The package has a base for holding the product. The base comprises an enclosed body, a closed bottom and an open top. The base further includes a stalk axially oriented within it. The stalk defines a trough along the inside perimeter of the base between the stalk and the body. Lastly, the package has a cap for sealing the open top of the base when the package is not in use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of filling packages for stick-form
cosmetic products, particularly
packages which are specially adapted for use with the
fill/invert process of manufacture. More particularly, the present
invention relates to filling packages that are designed to have a
limited use so as to be a sample or trial size package.In the design and manufacture of deodorant or antiperspirant
stick products it is preferable that the top of the stick have a
convex contour and that its cross-sectional shape be circular or
oval. The convex shape is desired so that the product is
comfortable to apply upon its first application and has a good
appearance to the consumer. The oval cross-section makes the
application more efficient by requiring a minimum number of strokes
to apply the product evenly. Such packages are typically equipped
with an elevator screw dispensing system wherein an elevator
platform is disposed within the package at its bottom end and has a
spindle in threaded engagement therewith. A hand wheel to turn the
spindle is located outside the bottom of the package for use by the
consumer in advancing and retracting the product.One method of manufacturing such products is known as the
bottom fill method. The desired shape of the stick product is
generally achieved by providing a package having an oval or circular
cross-section and a cap, factory seal or puck of the same
cross-section on the top of the package. The cap/puck/seal has a
smooth concave inner surface which is adapted to function as a mold
in forming the top of the stick. The product is poured into the
package in its molten state through the bottom. While the product
is still in the molten or liquid form the elevator/screw system is
inserted into the package and the bottom of the container is sealed. 
The product and package are then allowed to cool whereby the shape
of the package and the cap cause the product to take on the desired
appearance. An example of a cosmetic stick-type dispensing package
especially adapted for use with the bottom fill manufacturing method
can be found in U.S. Patent 4,369,158 issued to Woodruff et al. on
January 18, 1983.Another and more preferable method used to manufacture
stick-type cosmetic products is known as the fill/invert method.
This method produces a product with the desired shape by providing a
package having an oval or circular cross-section but with a closed
bottom. The package has the elevator/screw dispensing system
disposed therein before filling. The product is poured into

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a sample size packaged product comprising a solid stick form
product (5) and a package (1), wherein the product is secured within the package in a

fixed position throughout its use, the package comprising:

a) a base (10) for holding the stick form product, the base having an enclosed body
(13), a closed bottom (11) and an open top (12), the base further including a

stalk (20) oriented along a longitudinal axis extending from the bottom to the top
of the base and secured within the base adjacent the bottom, the base further

including a trough (30) along the inside perimeter of the base between the stalk
and the body; and
b) a removable cap (50) for sealing the open top (12) of the base (10),

the method comprising the steps of:

i) preparing the product in a liquid or molten state;
ii) pouring the product through the open top (12) of base (10);
iii) placing the cap (50) or a puck (40) over the open top of the base,
iv) thereafter inverting the package (1) so that the liquid or molten product flows
from the bottom of the trough (30) in order to fill the space between the top (12)

and the cap (50) or puck (40); and then
v) allowing the product to cool so that it hardens and takes on the shape of the inner
surface of the cap or puck whilst being secured to the stalk (20),

the volume between the top (12) and the inner surface (43) of the puck (40) or cap
(50), when the puck or cap is in place over the top of the base, defining a head space

volume (42), wherein the volumetric capacity of the trough (30) is at least as great as
the head space volume (42).
A method according to Claim 1 wherein the stalk (20) has a domed, convex top (29).
A method according to Claim 2 wherein the arc of the dome is tangent to the top (12)
of base(10).
A method according to any preceding Claim wherein the stalk (20) includes a means
for securing the product (5) within the base (10), the means comprising one or more

indentations (21, 25) disposed on the top (29) of the stalk (20).
A method according to any preceding Claim wherein the stalk (20) has a means to
allow air trapped in the package before inversion to escape to the bottom of the trough

(30) during inversion, the means comprising indented runners (26, 27, 28) extending
from the top (29) of the stalk (20) to its outermost edge. 
A method according to any preceding Claim wherein the package further includes a
means to secure the cap to the base.
A method according to any preceding Claim wherein the base is of one piece
construction.
A method according to any preceding Claim wherein the base has an oval cross-section
when taken perpendicular to its longitudinal axis running from the top to the

bottom.
A method according to any preceding Claim wherein the package further includes a
means for releasably securing several packages on top of one another.
