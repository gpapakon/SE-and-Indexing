<ABSTRACT>
A multiple-speed ratio transmission mechanism for an 
automotive vehicle includes a torque input shaft (12), an 

output shaft (234), an intermediate shaft, these three 
shafts rotatably supported on a common axis, and a 

countershaft (238) mounted parallel to the other shafts. 
Multiple pinion-gear pairs (2
6,36,240,246,242,248,244,250) are 
supported on the three coaxial shafts and countershaft. A 

planetary gear unit (98), including a sun gear (104), ring 
gear (100), and a set of planet pinions (106) rotatably 

supported on a carrier (108), has its input connected to the 
intermediate shaft and the output connected to the 

output shaft (234). Synchronisers (52,252,254,256) driveably 
connect a member of the pinion-gear pairs to one of the shafts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the arrangement of gears, 
shafts, and synchronisers of an automotive transmission, 
especially to such a transmission of the type having a 
countershaft or layshaft disposed parallel to a power input 
shaft. When the engine of a motor vehicle is idling and the 
neutral clutch that connects the engine to a manual 
transmission is disengaged, the speed of the engine varies 
as a result of cyclic irregularity intrinsic in the 
operation of an internal combustion engine. Countershaft 
manual transmissions for automotive use contain gear sets 
whose members are in continuous meshing engagement, though 
the gear selector of the transmission is in the neutral 
position. When the main drive clutch is engaged and the 
gear selector is in the neutral position, speed changes of 
the engine transmitted to the gearset produce noise called 
"neutral rollover gear rattle." When the engaged gear teeth 
change position with respect to each other due to engine 
speed variations, the teeth of the driven gear contact 
alternately the driving face and the non driving face of the 
driving pinion. To reduce or eliminate this objectionable noise, 
various devices have been employed to take up clearances 
between the faces of the gear and mating pinion. These 
devices include a wheel coaxially arranged with the gear 
having similar teeth to those of the gear, and means for 
elastically maintaining the teeth of the gear in position 
that is angularly offset relative to the gear. A mechanical 
spring, usually a helical spring, located radially offset 
from the axis of the gear, applies a force directed 
tangentially to the axis tending to rotate the angular 
element with respect to the gear wheel. Other means such as 
elastomeric material have been used in the prior art to bias 
an angular member angularly with respect to a gear to  
 
maintain contact between the gear teeth in order to avoid 
gear rattle. U.S. Patent 4, 718, 295 describes the use of a one-way 
clutch located on the input shaft between a gear wheel and a 
cylindrical surface of the shaft. The one-way clutch permits 
a one-way drive connection so that power can be transmitted 
through the clutch from the input shaft to either of two 
countershafts when fourth and fifth gear ratios are selected 
by the vehicle operator. Patent specification DE 40 00 833 discloses a vehicle 
gear transmission having the features of the pre-characterizing portion 
of indepent claim 1, providing multiple gear ratios and having 
an input shaft coupled
