<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aqueous compositions 
containing fluorochemical oil- and water-repellent agents. 
This invention also relates to agents that improve fluorine 
efficiency of fluorochemical oil- and water-repellent 
agents. This invention also relates to processes for 
providing oil- and water-repellency to fibrous substrate 
materials. Water-, oil- and soil-repellent finishes 
containing fluorochemical agents or compositions are well 
known. A considerable disadvantage of such finishes, 
however, is their high price. So-called "extenders" have 
therefore been developed in order to reduce cost. Modified 
synthetic resins, waxes, paraffin emulsions, and similar 
products have been used for this purpose. U.S. Pat. No. 3,849,521 (Kirimoto et al.) 
describes oil- and water-repellent compositions containing 
a polymer containing fluoroalkyl-containing monomer units 
and an additive copolymer containing monomer units having 
the formula 
CR1R2=CR3COOR4 
wherein R1, R2 and R3 represents hydrogen atoms or methyl 
groups, and R4 represents a C1-18 alkyl group; and monomer 
units having the formula: 
CH2=CR5CONHCH2OH 
wherein R5 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group. U.S. Pat. No. 4,834,784 (Deiner et al.) 
describes the use of blocked isocyanate compounds as 
extenders, the isocyanate compound before blocking being 
diphenylmethane diisocyanate or an isocyanate compound 
having a molecular weight of at least 450.  
 This invention provides fluorine-efficient oil- 
and water-repellent compositions comprising: 
(A) a fluorochemical oil- and water-repellent 
agent; (B) a copolymer extender comprising 
(i) polymerized units derived from a 
monomer of Formula V: 
CR1R2=CR3R4 
wherein each of R1, R2, R3 and R4 independently represents 
hydrogen, halogen, or an organic group such as alkyl, 
carboxyl, or acyloxyalkyl (i.e., -CO2alkyl); and (ii) polymerized units derived from a 
monomer of Formula VII: 
CH2=CR5X 
wherein R5 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, and 
X represents a moiety comprising a functional group that 
can interact with a fibrous substrate; and (C) a blocked isocyanate extender. This invention also provides substrates treated 
with a fluorine-efficient composition as described above, 
and methods of improving the fluorine-efficiency of a 
fluorochemical oil- and water-repellent agent, comprising 
the step of formulating the fluorochemical agent with 
components (B) and (C) described above. The compositions of the invention comprise at 
least one member of each of two classes of
