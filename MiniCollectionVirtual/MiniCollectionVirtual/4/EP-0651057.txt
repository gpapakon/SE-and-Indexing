<DESCRIPTION>
The invention described and claimed herein relates to 
the design and use of nucleic acid probes that can detect 
organisms of the Mycobacterium avium complex, in test 
samples, e.g., from sputum, body fluids, tissue samples, 
and from cultures. Two single strands of deoxyribo- ("DNA") or ribo- 
("RNA") nucleic acid, formed from nucleotides, (including 
the bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), thymidine (T), 
guanine (G), uracil (U), or inosine (I)), may hybridize to 
form a double-stranded structure held together by hydrogen 
bonds between pairs of complementary bases. Generally, 
hydrogen bonding occurs between A and T or U, while G or 
I are hydrogen bonded to C. Along the chain, classical 
base pairs AT or AU, TA or UA, GC, or CG are present. 
Additionally, some mismatched base pairs (e.g., AG, GU) 
may be present. Bringing together two single strands of nucleic acid 
containing sufficient contiguous complementary bases, 
under conditions that promote their hybridization, results 
in double-stranded nucleic acid. Under appropriate 
conditions DNA/DNA, RNA/DNA, or RNA/RNA hybrids can form. A probe is generally a single-stranded oligonucleotide 
having a nucleotide sequence complementary to some degree 
to a nucleic acid sequence sought to be detected ("target 
sequence"). A probe may be labeled with a reporter group 
such as a radioisotope, a fluorescent or chemiluminescent 
moiety, or with an enzyme or other ligand that can be used 
for detection. Kohne, U.S. Patent No. 4,851,330, and 
Hogan et al., International Patent Application No. PCT/US87/03009, 
entitled "Nucleic Acid Probes for Detection  
 
and/or Quantitation of Non-Viral Organisms," both 
references hereby incorporated by reference herein, 
describe detection of a nucleic acid sequence using 
nucleic acid hybridization. Hogan et al., supra, also 
describe methods for determining the presence of a non-viral 
organism or a group of non-viral organisms in a 
sample (e.g., sputum, urine, blood, tissue sections, food, 
soil and water). Members of the Mycobacterium avium complex have 
characteristic biochemical properties. These members can 
be differentiated into more than one species by nucleic 
acid probes and other types of analysis (Wayne and Sramek, 
Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 5:1-25, 1992). The complex includes 
the species Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacteriumintracellulare. Recent work indicates that the complex 
also includes additional members. (Wayne and Sramek, 
supra, Frothingham and Wilson, J. Bacteriol. 175:2818 
(1993)). Probes which
