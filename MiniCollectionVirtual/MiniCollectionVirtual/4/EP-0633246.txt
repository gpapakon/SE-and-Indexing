<ABSTRACT>
Recovery of caprolactam and of an alkali metal carbonate from distillation residues which are obtained in the purification of caprolactam and contain caprolactam and/or oligomers and/or polymers of caprolactam, and alkali metal hydroxides, by   (a) melting the distillation residues, which contain caprolactam and/or oligomers and/or polymers of caprolactam, and alkali metal hydroxides,   (b) continuously removing caprolactam from the melt, (c) cooling the melt after removing caprolactam with obtainment of a residue,   (d) dissolving the residue thus obtained in water and (e) subjecting the aqueous solution thus obtained to incineration with the formation of an alkali metal carbonate.

<CLAIMS>
A process for recovering caprolactam and an
alkali metal carbonate from distillation residues which

are obtained in the purification of caprolactam and
contain caprolactam and oligomers and polymers of

caprolactam and also alkali metal hydroxides, which
comprises


(a) melting the distillation residues,
(b) continuously removing caprolactam from the melt
using superheated steam and/or inert gas,
(c) after removing caprolactam, cooling the melt and
obtaining a residue,
(d) dissolving the residue thus obtained in water and
(e) subjecting the aqueous solution thus obtained to
combustion with the formation of an alkali metal

carbonate.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein superheated
steam or an inert gas having a temperature in the

range from 250 to 450Â°C is used.
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein,
as alkali metal hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and/or

potassium hydroxide are used.
