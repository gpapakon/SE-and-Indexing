<ABSTRACT>
Device to automatically or manually test the efficiency of the most 
sensitive and main components of an electrical apparatus for 

proctecting, controlling or signalling, in particular of a residual 
current circuit breaker, without interrupting the electrical supply, 

wherein the mechanical disconnecting chain which starts from the 
detector of the failure (relay) (10) to the hooking (17) of the 

mechanism is switched off for a litte while, decoupling the lever 
which usually transmits the motion in two half-lever (20) and (21) 

hinged on the same axis (14), when the interruption of the click 
mechanism is wished, having two possible mutual positions, the first 

one corresponding to the normal working order, the second one with 
the two half-levers (20, 21) free.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the present invention is a device which automatically
or manually performs a screening of a protection device after
prefixed whiles and may therefore work with any electric parameter,
e.g. the current, the tension, or the homopolar current or any other
quantity, even not an electric one, as long as it can go back to an
electric quantity.Electro-mechanical devices suitable for protecting plants, users and
workers are well known. A working failure of said devices causes
damages to the plant and is also dangerous for the safety of the
persons. Therefore, a continuous check, or at least after regular
whiles, of the working of said devices is important, as well as an
automatical intervention when the device fails, by replacing it
with another one or by cutting off the checked plant and/or by
signalling the failure to the operator.A device of known type for manually testing the efficiency of the
failure detector means of an automatic differential circuit breaker,
including a sliding body transmitting the motion from the failure
detector means to the disconnecting mechanism of the breaker is
described, for example, by EP-A-0 231 732.Said type of device has the drawback that, in case of a test
condition, the disconnecting mechanism is activated and moves the 
contacts of the main circuit in open position breaking the main
circuit: the electrical apparatuses which are power supplied by the
main circuit are therefore disconnected from the power supply.As the users are (or could be) intolerant on the diadvantages coming
from the disconnection of said electrical apparatuses from the power
supply during the test, said test is (or could be) omitted
frequently, affecting the safety of the users and of the electric
plant.The present description specifically refers to a checking device
for residual current circuit breakers against contact voltages in
order to protect human life; however, the principle and the
embodiment are suitable, with obvious modifications, to a further
protecting and adjusting device and also to a further regulating or
signalling device.The device object of the present invention deviates or stops the 
mechanical disconnecting chain for a little while (around one
second) inside the protecting apparatus. Said mechanical
disconnecting chain, starting from the electro-mechanical detector
of the failure quantity (i. e. the relay), releases automatically
or manually the hooking of the mechanism which normally activates
the contacts.In a particular embodiment during the short while in which

<CLAIMS>
Device to automatically or manually test the efficiency of the most sensitive
components of an electrical apparatus, in particular of a residual circuit breaker,

keeping the contacts of the main circuit in normal working order also in case of a
test condition and comprising a lever which transmits the motion from the pusher

of a relay belonging to the electrical apparatus to hooking means stopping the
disconnecting mechanism of the breaker; said device being characterised in that

said lever (13) is doubled in two half-levers (20, 21); in that said pusher (11) acts
on a first (20) of said two half-levers (20, 21); in that said device includes means

for automatically or manually injecting a simulated current of failure provoking the
intervention of the apparatus under test; and in that in case of a test condition

said first half-lever (20) is disconnected from the second half-lever (21) to prevent
the transmission of the motion from said pusher (11) to said hooking means (17),

while in case of normal working condition said half-levers (20, 21) are integrally
connected each other. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said lever
(13) is doubled in two half-levers (20, 21) hinged on the same axis

(14) but having two possible mutual positions:

(a) a first position, corresponding to the normal working order,
without the action of external agents, wherein said two half-levers

(20, 21) are integral to each other, thus forming a single lever,
which can rotate releasing the disconnecting mechanism and

commanding the switching off of the switch;
(b) a second position of said two half-levers (20, 21), being caused
by the action of external agents when the interruption of the click

mechanism is wished, said second position being obtained by shifting
the axis (14) of said two half-levers (20, 21) , so that the

dragging half-lever (20) shifts integrally with said axis (14)
because of two stops (22, 23) on said axis (14), whereas the dragged

half-lever (21) stops because it is linked to the stand (12) and is
free regarding the axis (14); thanks to the shifting of said axis

(14), the tailpiece (27) of the dragging half-lever is located 
inside a free space (28) of the dragged half-lever (21) and then,

during the test, the pusher (11) of the relay may freely rotate said
half-lever (20) till switching on a contact (29) which confirms that

the protection system is efficient, while the other half-lever (21)
and t
he hooking mechanism are still.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the link
between said two half-levers (20, 21) is performed by means of a pin

or a lock introduced in suitable bores placed on side walls of said
two half-levers which may become independent from each other only

when an external agent, like an electro-magnet, removes said pin or
lock from at least one of said half-levers.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said two half-levers
(20, 21) are integral to each other through magnetic means.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said two half-levers
(20, 21) are integral to each other during the normal working

order, whereas during the test they become independent from each
other by means of hydraulic or pneumatical devices applied to said

half-levers and externally guided.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the
interruption of the disconnecting chain is obtained by rotating, or

shifting, or both, the relay (10) by means of an external device
(52, 53, 54), so that said relay (10) reaches during the test a

different position wherein the pusher (11) of the relay (10) acts a
lever (56) in order to switch on the contact (58) confirming the

protection efficiency. 
Device according to claim 2, characterized by consisting of a button (60) to be
externally manually pressed which, beside the electrical contacts

necessary to inject a simulated current of failure provoking the
intervention of the apparatus under control, supports a cam (77) apt

to shift an axis (14) which, in its turn, shifts a half-lever (20)
free to rotate on said axis (14) and which, after this shifting,

looses its link to a second half-lever (21).
Device according to claim 7, characterized in that the cam (77)
provoking the shifting of the axis (14) on which both half-levers

(20, 21) rotate is blocked in its position relevant to the button
(60) by a lever (71) hinged on the fixed part of the apparatus

which, sliding on a side of said cam (77), links it to its position
even when the pressed button (60) shifts, said lever (71) having two

stable positions, one being the above mentioned and the other being
rotated with any angle with respect to the first which detaches it

from said cam (77) and then does not link it any longer, so that the
button (60) can perform any other function, but the one the cam

(77) is committed to.
Device according to claim 7, characterized in that it is provided
with simple means to subsequently act two electrical circuits, the

one being the circuit of a signalling lamp (89), and the other apt
to simulate a failure current, said circuits being synchronized with

the mechanical actions previously described.
Device according to the previous claims 7, 8, 9, characterized
in that the button (60) is replaced by any other actuator (e.g.

lever or rotating knob) and, anyway, carried out and acted.
