<ABSTRACT>
In a coin separation device with a rotating feed plate (3), the coin-collecting space (1) is limited by the feed plate (3) and by a shell (2). So that, during the operation of discharging coins, foreign bodies remaining in the coin-collecting space can be removed automatically, the shell (2) is mounted pivotably about an axis (18). During a pivoting movement, the formation of an exit gap for the foreign bodies occurs for initiating the pivoting movement there is an actuator (19) which is connected to the shell (2) via an elastic coupling element (24).

Coin separating device having a rotating conveying 
plate (3) which is inclined to the rear and is 

provided, in the region of its rim, with carriers (4) by 
means of which, during the rotation of the said plate, 

coins (5) are conveyed from a coin collection space (1) 
to a delivery rail (6) from which foreign bodies (9) 

having rounded edges can slip off and drop back into the 
coin collection space (1), characterized in that, on 

completion of at least one separation operation, at least 
a part of the coin collection space (1) can be moved 

automatically from a collecting position into an emptying 
position in which foreign bodies (9) which have accummulated 

in the coin collection space (1) can exit from 
the coin collection space (1). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the coin collection space (1) is formed by a tray 

(2) which is open at the top, is closed on one side by 
the conveying plate (3), and can be pivoted from the 

collecting position into the emptying position about an 
axis (18), which runs essentially parallel to the plane 

of rotation of the conveying plate (3), with formation of 
an exit gap for the foreign bodies. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that a ram (23) of an actuating drive (19), which ram can 

be moved back and forth and serves to introduce the 
pivoting movement into the tray (2), engages on the side 

of the tray (2) located opposite the pivoting axis (18). 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the ram (23) is connected to the tray (2) by means 

of an elastic coupling element (24).  
 
Device according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized 
in that the actuating drive (19) is mounted so as to be 

pivotable about an axis (20) which runs parallel to the 
pivoting axis (18) of the tray (2). 
Device according to one or more of Claims 3 to 5, 
characterized in that the ram (23) of the actuating drive 

(19) is formed by a rack which meshes with the pinion 
(22) of a geared motor (21). 
Device according to one or more of Claims 3 to 6, 
characterized in that the end positions of the ram (23) 

of the actuating drive (19) are monitored by sensors (27, 
28). 
Device according to one or more of Claims 2 to 7, 
characterized in that the tray (2) can be pivoted about 

an axis (18) which is formed by a hinge which is flexible 
and longitudinally elastic and has rubber buffers (14, 

15). 
Device according to one or more of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the region of the rim of the 

conveying plate (3) bearing the carriers (4) is flat. 
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that a guide wall (11) for the coins surrounds the 

conveying plate (3) over the major part of its circumference. 
Device according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that the guide wall (11) is formed by an integral constituent 

of the tray (2). 
Device according to one or more of Claims 2 to 
11, characterized in that the conveying plate (3) is 

provided with a cam (29) which is assigned at least one 
ramp (30) arranged on the tray (2) to introduce a shaking 

movement into the tray (2). 
Device according to one or more of Claims 1 to 
12, characterized in that the delivery rail (6) has a 

slide-off slope (8) at a distance from the coin transfer 
point.
