<ABSTRACT>
A parts-conveying apparatus comprising an elongated 
guide member (3) having a guide channel (5) extending 

throughout the entire length of the guide member (3) for 
supporting parts (W) therein; and an endless belt unit (4) 

comprising a pair of rollers (9, 10) and an endless belt (8) 
wrapped around the rollers (9, 10), one of the rollers (9) 

being operatively connected to a drive source (11), the 
endless belt (8) having one substantially rectilinear part 

extending alongside of the guide channel (5) substantially 
over its entire length in order to feed the parts (W).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to parts-conveying 
apparatus for conveying parts from a parts feeder to an 
assembling station with parts keeping their correct 
arrangement and posture. An apparatus suitable for such a purpose is known, for example, 
from DE-A 3 413 234 (see figure 12 in particular). When parts are conveyed to an assembling station in an 
automatic assembling machine, such parts must be conveyed 
in such proper arrangement or posture as to meet the 
subsequent operation carried out at the assembling station. If 
the part to be worked on is different in shape either between 
the upper side and the lower side or between the front side 
and the rear side, the necessity of conveying the parts in such 
proper arrangement and posture is more pronounced. An apparatus which has been commonly used for this 
purpose comprises a bowl-shaped parts feeder for storing 
parts and a downward-inclined or vertical gravity-type chute 
having its upper end joined to an outlet of the parts feeder 
for feeding the parts from the parts feeder through the chute 
to the assembling station via their own gravity. Since the 
parts must slide down the chute via their own gravity, the 
parts feeder must be positioned far above the assembling 
station of the automatic assembling machine. Considering the subsequent operation to be carried out at 
the assembling station of the automatic assembling machine, 
the parts must be fed to the assembling station 
intermittently. It must be ensured that an ensuing part be  
 
ready at the lower end of the chute well before a preceding 
part is finished. However, if parts are different in shape between their 
front side and rear side, sometimes, feeding of parts is 
interrupted and sometimes, parts are supplied, at once, in a 
large number, in other words, smooth and stable feeding of 
parts cannot be accomplished. Therefore, there is no 
guarantee that a part is always ready for assemblage at the 
lower end of the chute. With the foregoing difficulties in view, it is therefore an 
object of the present invention to provide a parts-conveying 
apparatus which ensures that parts can always be made 
ready for assemblage and parts can be conveyed from a 
parts feeder to an assembling station with the parts keeping 
their correct posture and arrangement so that the assembling 
operation of parts can be carried out without a problem. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is 
provided a parts-conveying apparatus.

<CLAIMS>
A parts-conveying apparatus wherein 

conveying means are provided for supporting and conveying 
parts (W) and the conveying means include an endless belt unit 

(4) comprising an endless belt (8) driven by rollers (9, 10) 
and provided with guide means and having one substantial 

rectilinear part extending alongside of the guide means,
 
   characterised in that 
the guide means is a guide member (3) forming a guide 
channel (5) for supporting the parts (W) therein and extending 

substantially over the length of the conveying means, 
the guide member (3) has a slot (6) formed throughout the 
length thereof so as to communicate with the guide channel, 
the endless belt (8) is adapted for positively feeding the 
parts through the slot (6) with the parts supported by the 

guide member (3). 
A parts-conveying apparatus (P1, P2, P3) according to 

claim 1, further including a stopper rod (13) disposed beside 
the guide member (3) and reciprocally movable into and 

away from the guide channel (5) in order to press the parts 
(W) against a surface which partly defines the guide channel 

(5). 
A parts-conveying apparatus (P1, P2, P3) according to 
claim 2, the positive feed means comprising a plurality of 

brushes (12) planted at equal intervals throughout the full 
length of the front surface 

of the endless belt (8), 
these brushes (12) being 

composed of a number of rigid short fibers tightly bonded 
together.  

 
A parts-conveying apparatus (P1, P2, P3) according to 
claim 2, the positive feed means comprising alternate ridges 

and grooves (14a) provided over the entire peripheral length 
of the endless belt (8). 
A parts-conveying apparatus (P1, P2, P3) according to 
claim 2, the positive feed means comprising a separate layer 

(14b) of soft synthetic resin wrapped on the endless belt 8 
over the entire periphery.
