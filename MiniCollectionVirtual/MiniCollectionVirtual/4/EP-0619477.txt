<ABSTRACT>
In a pressure sensor whose sensitive element is constituted by a 
deformable membrane (22) carrying a bridge of piezoresistive strain gauges 

suitable for measuring deformation of the membrane, a decoupling piece (34) is 
interposed between the membrane (22) and its support (28). The decoupling 

piece includes a deformable zone (38), and limited clearance (44) is left 
between the outer peripheral zone (36) of the decoupling piece (34) and the 

support (28) such that when pressure is applied during manufacture of the 
sensor to fix the membrane (22) to the decoupling piece (34), e.g. by gluing, 

the deformable zone (38) does not break.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates mainly to a high accuracy sensor pressure suitable 
for operating in a medium subjected to a hydrostatic pressure that is very 
high (e.g. about 1,000 bars). The invention also relates to a pressure 
gradiometer incorporating a differential pressure sensor. Finally, the 
invention also relates to a method of manufacturing such a pressure sensor. Given its characteristics, a particular application of the pressure sensor 
of the invention lies in the differential pressure measurements that are 
performed in oil wells, in particular for measuring the density of the fluid 
present in the well at a given level or for measuring the displacement speed 
of the fluid, e.g. by the Venturi effect. Nevertheless, applications of the 
pressure sensor of the invention are not limited to the petroleum industry and 
they cover all fields in which a pressure or a pressure difference needs to be 
measured in a manner that is particularly reliable and accurate. Thus, and 
merely by way of example, the pressure sensor of the invention may be used in 
a Pitot tube as used onboard aircraft for measuring speed. To perform differential pressure measurements in an oil well, it is known 
to make use of pressure sensors in which the sensitive element is constituted 
by a membrane suitable for deforming when a very small pressure difference 
exists across the membrane. Membrane deformation may be measured, for 
example, by means of piezoresistive strain gauges associated with the 
membrane. In pressure sensors of this type, the deformable membrane comprises a 
frame-forming peripheral portion via which the membrane is fixed on a rigid 
support, e.g. by gluing or by welding. Conventionally, the peripheral region of the deformable membrane is glued 
or welded directly to the rigid support. However, that disposition gives rise 
to measurement errors that are sometimes large because of the stresses induced 
in the membrane by the surrounding temperature or pressure. These stresses 
may be the result, in particular, of differences between the thermal expansion 
coefficients and the elasticity moduli of the materials constituting the  
 
membrane and the support. In addition, the deformations to which the rigid 
support is subjected because of a change in temperature or pressure are 
transmitted in full to the membrane via its peripheral region. These 
deformations give rise to a measurement error, which can be particularly large 
when the initial shape of the membrane is not plane. The amplitude of the 
error also
