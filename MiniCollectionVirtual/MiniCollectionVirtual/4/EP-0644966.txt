<ABSTRACT>
A method of bleaching waste paper pulp. The pulp is first treated to a reductive chemical followed by acidification and washing or dewatering. The pulp is then subjected to ozone and then to hydrogen peroxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
As society becomes increasingly environmentally conscious, 
there has been a growing trend to recycle a wide variety of 
consumable products including newspapers and other wood pulp-based 
materials. Deinked waste fiber from chemical pulp products has been 
usually bleached by chlorine-based compounds, specifically 
chlorine and sodium hypochlorite. However, the industry starts 
moving away from chlorine for environmental concerns and this 
trend has been perceived as well in the recycled paper industry. 
Sodium hypochlorite is also perceived to be a chlorine compounds 
producer in effluent streams and air emissions and, as a result, 
is also an environmental concern. As such, there is now a 
growing interest to use ozone and/or hydrogen peroxide in the 
bleaching of recycled pulps. It is known, for example, from "Cellulose Chemistry and 
Technology," 23-307-319 (1989) to bleach pulp with ozone. 
However, ozone degrades cellulose which consequently generates an 
important decrease of the poly-merization degree of said 
cellulose which in turn decreases mechanical strength of the 
pulp. In the article entitled "Upgrading of Waste Paper with 
Hydrogen Peroxide," O. Helmling, Recycling Paper from Fiber to 
Finished Products, pg. 714-724, is disclosed the upgrading of 
pulp from waste paper with hydrogen peroxide added during 
repulping; otherwise, the pulp will yellow particularly under 
alkaline conditions.  
 Alkaline repulping is usually considered as being necessary 
for dissolving the pulp fiber structure and for 
dislodging ink particles from fibers by the swelling 
process. However, it is necessary to stabilize hydrogen 
peroxide when it is added to the pulp, because hydrogen 
peroxide is decomposed by heavy metal ions and/or consumed 
by other organic fine material found in waste paper 
and/or dilution water. In early deinking processes 
carried out with hydrogen peroxide, up to 5% sodium 
silicate was added to the pulp as a stabilizer. However, 
because of scaling-up problems and reduced efficiency of 
the retention aids for paper manufacture, a number of 
chelating agents were developed as substitutes for sodium 
silicate as a stabilizer for hydrogen peroxide, as 
disclosed by Indresh Mathur in "Chelant Optimization in 
Deinking Formulation," 1st Research Forum on Recycling, 
October 1991, pp. 1-7. In any event, regardless of the 
stabilizer employed, it is believed to be necessary by 
the man skilled in the art to use some stabilizer for 
hydrogen peroxide particularly in light of the metal ion
