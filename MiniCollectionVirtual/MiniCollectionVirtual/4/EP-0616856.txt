<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a method for removing fine 
particles electrostatically adhering to a synthetic 

resin pellets from a mixture of the synthetic resin 
pellets containing the fine particles, which comprises 

bringing the mixture into contact with a gas which has 
been subjected to ionization treatment to eliminate the 

electrostatic adhesion between the synthetic resin 
pellets and the fine particles, and separating the 

resulting fine particles in which said adhesion has 
been eliminated. According to the above method, fine 

particles electrostatically adhering to the synthetic 
resin pellets are efficiently removed. There are also 

provided two types of apparatuses for practicing the 
above method and a stockyard of synthetic resin pellets 

equipped with either of the above apparatuses.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for
efficiently removing fine particles adhering to
synthetic resin pellets by an electrostatic charge.
This invention further relates to a stock yard of a
synthetic resin pellets.In general, synthetic resin pellets carry
fine particles which are generated during a step of
producing the pellets or transportation of them. The
presence of such fine particles causes a variety of
problems in molding processes with such
synthetic resin pellets, decreasing the commercial value
of the synthetic resin pellets. Accordingly, the fine
particles have to be removed as much as possible.In recent years, synthetic resins, for
example polycarbonate resins, have been used in
information recording substrates or optical equipment
such as optical lenses or the like. Since, in the
optical usage, incorporation of foreign matter has to
be extremely excluded, the molding process of the
optical equipment is generally carried out in a clean
room. Accordingly, a permissible amount of the 16-mesh-pass
fine particles carried with the polycarbonate
resin pellets which are used in the optical equipment
is considered to be 40 ppm or less.Several methods for removing fine particles
from synthetic resin pellets have been hitherto known.
For example, there is a method in which fine particles
are removed through a wire net by colliding synthetic 
resin pellets against the wire net through a high-speed
air flow (15 m/second or more). Such method, however,
causes a trouble that when the wire net is broken, a
metal wire is incorporated into the synthetic resin
pellets. When a punching metal is used instead of the
wire net to avoid this trouble, problems such as
crushing of the synthetic resin pellets tend to occur.
There is also proposed a method in which fine particles
are removed through a rotary drum covered with a wire
net or a vibratory screen. In this method, high
removal percentage of 9-mesh-pass and 16-mesh-on fine
particles can be gained. According to the present
inventors' actual measurement, it was 80 to 90 %.
However, removal percentage of the 16-mesh-pass fine
particles is insufficient, and the present inventors'
actual measurement showed that it was 60 to 75 %.
Further, there are a method in which synthetic resin
pellets are caused to fall on a top of a conical body,
and when the synthetic resin pellets fall from the
peripheral portion of the conical body, the fine
particles are removed by a rising air flow, and a
method in which synthetic resin pellets are caused to
fall while successively
