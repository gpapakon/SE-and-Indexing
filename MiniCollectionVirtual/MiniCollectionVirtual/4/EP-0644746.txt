<ABSTRACT>
A transdermal/transmucosal drug delivery system utilizes glycerin to moderate the initial burst effect of transdermal drug delivery and also maintain the delivery to the derma/mucosa at a relatively sustained rate over the duration of the application to either an application or afflicted situs. The drug composition contains an effective amount of a percutaneously absorbable drug and an amount of glycerin which is effective to moderate and maintain the transdermal delivery of the drug. The system also contains means for maintaining the drug composition in a drug transferring relationship with the derma/mucosa. When applied to an afflicted situs the composition is preferably a gel, cream, lotion or ointment. When applied to an application situs the compositions are contained within a device such as a matrix or liquid reservoir patch which is held to the application site by means of the adhesive. The drug composition may contain glycerin in amounts of between about 0.1 to 50 % by volume.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to a method for
moderating, altering or controlling the delivery of
agents across biological membranes including skin or
mucosa. More particularly the invention relates to
the use of glycerin to reduce initial high delivery
rates while maintaining a more uniform drug
penetration over the intended duration of application
of a transdermal or transmucosal drug delivery system.
The invention thus encompasses a method of moderating
drug penetration by co-administering glycerin with
various transdermal/transmucosal delivery compositions
which may or may not contain permeation enhancers.The oral administration of drugs as currently
employed is undesirable for a number of reasons.
First, drugs with short half lives require frequent
dosing (2 to 4 times daily) which can lead to
inadequate compliance. Second, the short plasma half
life of the drug and frequent dosing regimen result in
"peaks" and "valleys" in the plasma concentration
profile, which increases the likelihood of adverse
side effects associated with the peak concentration as
well as lapse on therapeutic effectiveness towards the
end of the dosing interval. Third, the potential
hepatic first pass metabolism associated with oral
administration could lead to poor bioavailibility of
the drug. Thus, an effective and consistent
transdermal drug delivery system for such drugs would
be far superior to the current oral regimen.Transdermal delivery of drugs provides many
advantages over conventional oral administration. 
Advantages of transdermal systems include convenience,
noninterrupted therapy, improved patient compliance,
reversibility of treatment (by removal of the system
from the skin), elimination of "hepatic first pass"
effect, the high degree of control over blood
concentration of any particular drug and consequent
reduction of side effects.Although transdermal systems have many
advantages, most drugs are not amenable to this mode
of administration due to the well known barrier
properties of the skin. Molecules moving from the
environment into and through intact skin must first
penetrate the stratum corneum and any material on its
surface. The molecule must then penetrate the viable
epidermis, the papillary dermis, and then the
capillary walls and into systemic circulation. Along
the way each of the above mentioned tissues will
exhibit a different resistance to penetration by the
same molecule; however, it is the stratum corneum that
presents the greatest barrier to absorption of topical
compositions or transdermally
