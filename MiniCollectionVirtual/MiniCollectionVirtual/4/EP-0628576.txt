polymerization temperature as well as drying the polymer 
before any substantial cooling thereof. U.S. Patent No. 3,663,518 relates to a 
process for preparing acrylamide polymers by forming a solution of 
at least one monomer and a catalyst, preparing a thin film  
 
therefrom, heating said formed thin film to a temperature 
sufficient to initiate polymerization and initiating such 
polymerization and maintaining the polymerization temperature 
until the polymerization is essentially complete. U.S. Patent No. 3,732,,193 relates to a continuous 
polymerization process in which an aqueous solution of a water 
soluble unsaturated monomer is polymerized on a heated 
continuously moving belt to produce a dry thin film. The polymer 
is usually polyacrylamide. U.S. Patent No. 3,478,091 relates to the 
preparation of 2-amido-2-alkenesulfonates by reacting a ketone 
having at least one hydrogen atom in each alpha position with a 
nitrile and a sulfuric acid. U.S. Patent 3,503,941 relates to the 
production of dry acrylic polymers produced by polymerizing an 
aqueous solution of acrylic acid in a pressurized, heated reaction 
zone and subsequently extruding the polymer to yield a fibrous 
brittle ribbon. U.S. Patent 3,666,810 relates to the preparation of 
N-3-aminoalkyl propionamides and to polymers thereof by reaction 
analogous N-3-oxohydrocarbon-substituted amides with an amine in 
the presence of a reducing agent. U.S. Patent 4,034,001 relates to the preparation 
of bis-amidoalkanesulfonic acids and salts thereof. U.S. Patent 4,138,539 relates to a multi-step 
process for preparing a high molecular weight water soluble 
synthetic polymer in the form of a readily dissolved powder  
 
wherein water soluble ethylenically unsaturated monomers and an 
aqueous redox initiator system are utilized. U.S. Patent 4,208,329 relates to the purificaticn 
of acrylonitrile monomer by the
