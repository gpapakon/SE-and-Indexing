<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to methods and compositions for delivering drugs to the body by binding them to hemoglobin. This technique stabilizes the drug and extends its half-life in the body. The drug may be chemically coupled to or adsorbed on the hemoglobin chain(s). Polypeptide therapeutics are ideally linked to an artificial hemoglobin via a cysteine located deep within a cleft in the hemoglobin molecule.

<DESCRIPTION>
Hoffman and Nagai, U.S. Serial No. 07/194,338,
filed May 10, 1988, now U.S. Patent No. 5,028,588,
presently owned by Somatogen, Inc. relates to the use of
low oxygen affinity mutant hemoglobins as blood
substitutes, and to the expression of alpha and beta globin
in nonerythroid cells. Hoffman and Nagai, U.S. Serial No.
07/443,950, filed December 1, 1989, discloses certain
additional dicysteine hemoglobin mutants; it is a
continuation-in-part of 07/194,338. Hoffman, et al.,
Serial No. 07/671,707, filed April 1, 1991, which is the
national stage of PCT/US0/02654, filed May 10, 1990,
discusses expression of hemoglobins in yeast, polycistronic
coexpression of alpha-and beta-globins and in vivo assembly
of biologically active, tetrameric hemoglobin, and the
production of di-alpha and di-beta globin pseudodimers and
their use in the assembly of pseudotetrameric hemoglobins
with increased intravascular retention. Hoffman, et al.,
Atty. Docket No. HOFFMAN5B-USA, filed November 8, 1991,
entitled PRODUCTION AND USE OF HEMOGLOBINS AND ANALOGUES
THEREOF, Serial No. 07/789,179, is a continuation-in-part
of Serial No. 07/671,707, and discloses monocysteine
mutants of hemoglobins and the production and use of
octomeric and other multimeric hemoglobins built by use,
e.g., of pseudodimers.The invention relates to the controlled release
of drugs in the blood.Many pharmaceuticals have a relatively short 
half-life in the bloodstream due to renal clearance or
rapid metabolism. This is particularly true for
polypeptide pharmaceuticals which are smaller than the
renal filtration limit of about 50,000 to 70,000 daltons.
In recent years, many pharmaceutical companies and other
institutions have devoted considerable time and resources
into extending the duration of a drug in the human body.
The advantages of having a patient take a drug less often
are numerous; such as, better compliance, more predictable
concentrations in the body, and fewer side effects from the
sudden rush of medication shortly after it is administered.
All medications, especially those given prophylactically or
for a long period of time, are more readily accepted by the
patient if they need to be taken less often.For medications which are given parenterally,
every injection carries with it a chance for infection and
imparts a certain amount of pain. Many patients are
hospitalized simply because they need continuous or
frequent injections of various pharmaceuticals. If the
drug could be administered less often, some hospitalization
costs may be avoided.To
