<ABSTRACT>
A method produces a surface of a cured silicone 
elastomer with a hardened protective coating when an RTV 

silicone composition is blended with an oxygen curing 
compound, exposing the resulting composition to moisture to 

produce a cured dull surface, then applying a hardenable 
protective coating composition (such as paint) to the cured 

surface to obtain a flaw-free film and then allowing the 
coating composition to harden.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for producing a
painted surface on a silicone elastomer obtained from a room
temperature vulcanizable (RTV) silicone elastomeric
composition.Silicone compositions which cure to produce
elastomers at room temperature are widely used as sealants
and caulking materials because they have a unique property
profile for such applications, such as in building
construction. These properties include excellent
weatherability, resistance to heat, maintaining their
flexibility at low temperatures, ease of application and
rapid cure in place. However, the structures in which such
sealants and caulking materials are used are often coated
with decorative and protective coatings, such as with paints,
varnishes, lacquers and shellacs. Silicone elastomers have a
disadvantage in that they do not have surfaces which accept
such organic based decorative and protective coatings. It is
desired to render the exposed surface of silicone elastomers
paintable for aesthetic purposes and to provide them some
surface protection from the environment. While certain
silicone elastomers may accept some paints, it is very
inconvenient to commercially provide consumers with silicone
elastomeric compositions that have limited acceptability to
decorative and protective coatings.Many persons have advanced approaches to solving
these problems of silicone elastomers. However, these
compositions provide only a specific RTV silicone composition
which cures to an elastomer with a surface which can be
painted with at least one decorative or protective organic 
based paint. Additionally, these solvent containing
compositions are environmentally unacceptable today because
they have too high a content of volatile organic material
(the organic solvent). Furthermore, the high shrinkage
caused by the evaporation of the organic solvent has a
negative effect on the sealing capability of these sealants.Even today, the state of the art is such that
silicone rubber is still considered to be unpaintable, see
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,063,270, 4,965,311, 4,906,707, 4,902,575
and 4,985,476. Although each of the foregoing patents teach
various solutions to the paintability problem of silicone
rubber, they each are faced with difficulties and are
specific to certain kinds of silicone rubber.It is desirable to, therefore, provide a method
suitable for many kinds of RTV silicone elastomeric
compositions so that their surfaces are paintable with many
kinds of protective coatings and are at the same time more
environmentally acceptable.This

A method of producing a cured silicone
elastomer with a surface coated by a hardened protective

coating comprising

blending a room temperature vulcanizable silicone
composition comprising a polydiorganosiloxane having

condensable end groups, a moisture sensitive silicon-crosslinker
and a filler with an oxygen curing compound to

make a modified composition,
exposing the modified composition to moisture until
a cured elastomeric surface is obtained and a homogeneous

dull surface develops, thereafter
applying a protective coating composition, selected
from varnishes, lacquers, shellacs and paints hardenable at

ambient conditions over at least a portion of the cured
elastomeric surface where the protective coating composition

wets the surface to which it is applied and produces an
essentially flaw-free film, thereafter
allowing the protective coating composition to
harden.

comprising storing the room temperature vulcanizable silicone

composition in a first package and the oxygen curing compound
in a second package prior to forming the modified

composition.

the oxygen curing compound is a natural drying oil. 
The method in accordance with claim 1 in which
the silicon-crosslinker is a ketoximosilicon crosslinker

The method in accordance with claim 2 in which
the room temperature vulcanizable silicone composition is

stored in two packages wherein one package comprises the
polydiorganosiloxane and another package comprises the

moisture sensitive silicon-crosslinker.

A method of producing a cured silicone
