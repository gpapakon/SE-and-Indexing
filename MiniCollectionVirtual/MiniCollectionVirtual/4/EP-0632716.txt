A process for reducing the content of free formaldehyde 
and formic acid in nonionic and anionic surfactants, 

in which the products are stabilized by the 
addition of an amine compound selected from the group 

consisting of 

a) alkanolamines, 
b) aminocarboxylic acids and 
c) oligopeptides. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that nonionic and anionic surfactants containing 1 to 100 

ethylene oxide units in the form of at least one polyethylene 
glycol chain are stabilized. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that nonionic surfactants selected from the group consisting 

of adducts of ethylene oxide with compounds 
containing active hydrogen atoms and fatty acid esters 

are stabilized. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that anionic surfactants selected from the group consisting 

of adducts of ethylene oxide with compounds containing 
active hydrogen atoms and fatty acid esters are 

stabilized, the compounds mentioned containing at least 
one sulfate, sulfonate, carboxylate and/or phosphate 

group in the molecule. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that alkanolamines containing 2 to 15 carbon atoms are 

used. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that aminocarboxylic acids containing 2 to 8 carbon atoms 

are used. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that oligopeptides with an average molecular weight of  

 
500 to 5000 are used. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the stabilizers are used in quantities of 50 to 6000 

ppm, based on active substance of the surfactants to be 
stabilized.
