<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to motor controls and
more specifically to motor controls included in a cellular
communications network.The world is increasingly using electric motors for
power transfer. Motors use electrical energy generated, at
times, from fossil fuels and nuclear energy sources. As
global efforts continue to optimize the rate and efficiency
of power supply, so will increasing efforts to improve the
efficiency of power demand. Power quality in demand will
not only be dependent upon switching efficiency, speed and
protection; but also upon flexibility in applying power
control systems.At the present time, electrical motors in large
systems, such as assembly lines in large manufacturing
plants, etc. are hardwired into the system. Each time there
is a need to change the assembly line the entire line must
be shut down while motors are removed and rewired at a
different location. Further, these wires have a tendency to
wear and become entangled so that rewiring is often
necessary and very difficult.In fact, the highest single
defect mechanism from today's industrial networks is the
electrical wiring.In addition to this wiring problem, electrical motors
have a tendency to wear and apparatus to which they are
attached also wears. When a motor finally burns out,
because of a defect in the motor itself or in the apparatus
being controlled by the motor, the apparatus must be shut
down for repair and, in some cases rebuilding. Also, in 
many systems all motors may depend upon each of the other
motors, such as in a pumping system, assembly lines, etc.
In these systems the motors are timed to operate together
and if one motor burns out, or is reduced in speed, the
remaining motors, or the system, can be endangered. If
defects and pending breakdowns can be predicted, the shut
down time can often be minimized.US-A-4,102,394 describes a control unit for oil well
pumps, which includes a radio-controlled variable speed AC motor powering
each pump. The control unit enables the operator to control
various attributes of the pumping operation.It is a purpose of the present invention to provide a
new and improved cellular motor control network.It is a further purpose of the present invention to
provide a new and improved cellular motor control network
which does not require hard wiring for the control of motors
therein.It is a still further purpose of the present invention
to provide a new and improved cellular motor control network
in which the installation and repositioning of motors is
relatively easy.It
