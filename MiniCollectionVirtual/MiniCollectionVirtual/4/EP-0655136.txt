<ABSTRACT>
A hapten or anti-hapten antibody assay device comprises a solid support and a reagent covalently linked to a ligand to form a conjugate immobilising said reagent on said solid support, the reagent being recognized by antibodies capable of recognizing the hapten. The invention is characterized in that the ligand is a nucleic acid fragment. It may be used in assaying a hapten in a liquid specimen using a competitive technique.

<CLAIMS>
Hapten or anti-hapten antibody assay device
comprising a solid support and a reagent covalently

linked to a ligand to form a conjugate which makes it
possible to immobilize the said reagent onto the said

solid support by means of the said ligand, the said
reagent being recognized by antibodies capable of recognizing

the said hapten, characterized by the fact that
the said ligand is a nucleic acid fragment.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized by
the fact that the said conjugate is immobilized by

passive adsorption of the said fragment onto the solid
support.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized by
the fact that the said conjugate is immobilized by

covalent coupling of the said fragment onto the solid
support.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized by
the fact that the said conjugate is immobilized onto the

solid support by hybridization with a second nucleic
acid fragment capable of hybridizing with the said

nucleic acid fragment of the said conjugate, the said
second nucleic acid fragment being immobilized on the

support.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized by
the fact that the said conjugate is immobilized on the

support by means of an antibody or an antibody fragment
directed against the said nucleic acid fragment of the 

said conjugate, the said antibody being immobilized on
the said solid support.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized by
the fact that it comprises a protein immobilized on the

support, the said protein being capable of binding with
the said fragment.
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized by the fact that the nucleic acid

fragment is chosen from a DNA fragment, an RNA fragment
and a modified DNA or RNA fragment.
Device according to the preceding claim, characterized
by the fact that the said nucleic acid fragment

is a deoxyribonucleotide, a ribonucleotide, a
deoxyribonucleoside or a ribonucleoside.
Device according to Claim 7, characterized by
the fact that the nucleic acid fragment is an

oligodeoxyribonucleotide or an oligoribonucleotide with
a length of between 2 and 100 nucleotides and in

particular between 10 and 50 nucleotides.
Process for assaying a hapten in a liquid sample
characterized by the fact that:


a predetermined quantity of antibodies capable
of recognizing the said hapten is added to the said

sample;
the sample is brought into contact with the
device as defined in any one of the preceding claims;
the quantity of antibody attached to the solid
support is evaluated;
and the quantity of hapten present in the
sample is deduced therefrom according to known methods.
