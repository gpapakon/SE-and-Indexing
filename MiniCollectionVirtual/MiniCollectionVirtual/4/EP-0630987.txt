<ABSTRACT>
Process for coating with paint by electrophoresis of an article made of galvanised alloy steel, such as a sheet, which consists in a first step in vacuum-depositing on at least one face of the said article of galvanised alloy steel an iron-zinc coating containing less than 60 % of iron by weight and whose thickness does not exceed 1  mu m and then in subjecting the said article, thus coated, to an operation of painting by electrophoresis. This process makes it possible to avoid the phenomenon of surface crater formation on the substrate, delays the appearance of seizing and facilitates the subsequent shaping of the substrate.

<CLAIMS>
Process for coating a part made of galvanized-alloyed
steel with paint by cataphoresis characterized in that a

surface-coating layer of iron-zinc alloy of which the content
by weight of iron is less than 60% is deposited under vacuum

on at least one face of said part, before it is painted.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
content by weight of iron of the iron-zinc coating is between

5 and 50%.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the thickness of the iron-zinc coating is at most 1 µm.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the deposition under vacuum is carried

out by evaporating at least one part containing the materials
for forming the coating.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that evaporation is brought about by heating

by the Joule effect, induction or electron bombardment.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that, before the iron-zinc coating is

deposited, the face of the galvanized-alloyed steel substrate 
is subjected to ion bombardment in a gas or gaseous mixture

consisting of at least one neutral gas and/or at least one
reactive gas.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that, at the same time as the iron-zinc

coating is deposited, the face of the alloyed galvanized steel
substrate is subjected to ion bombardment in a gas or gaseous

mixture consisting of at least one neutral gas and/or at least
one reactive gas.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the galvanized-alloyed steel part coated

with said iron-zinc alloy is shaped, in particular by
pressing 
,
 before being subjected to the cataphoresis
operation.
Use of a steel part coated with a base layer and a
surface layer, said base layer consisting of zinc or a

zinc-based alloy and the surface layer consisting of an
iron-zinc alloy which is deposited under vacuum and of which

the content by weight of iron is less than 60%, for coating
with paint by cataphoresis.
Use of a coated steel part according to Claim 9, wherein
said surface layer is at most 1 µm thick. 
Use of a coated steel part according to Claim 9 or 10,
wherein said part is shaped, in particular by pressing, before

being painted.
Steel part coated with paint and comprising a steel
substrate, a base layer consisting of zinc or a zinc-alloy and

deposited onto this substrate, a surface layer covering said
base layer and an outer coat of paint, characterized in that

said surface layer consists of an iron-zinc alloy which is
deposited under vacuum and of which the content by weight of

iron is less than 60%; and in that said coat of paint is
applied to said surface layer by cataphoresis.
Steel part according to Claim 12, characterized in that
the thickness of said surface layer is at most 1 µm.
Steel part according to either of Claims 11 and 12,
characterized in that said part is shaped, in particular by

pressing, before being painted.
