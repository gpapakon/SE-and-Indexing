<ABSTRACT>
A first screw body (58) is rotatively mounted around a screwing axis (C; C', C'') that extends parallel to the axis (A) of the brake disk (10) in a housing axially arranged next to the brake disk (10) in the mounted position. A second screw body (66) is secured against rotation and linked to the first screw body (58) by a readjustment threaded coupling (68), so that both screw bodies (58, 66) form together a longitudinally adjustable tappet for exercising an actuating force on a brake shoe (22). A rotary body (42) can be rotated around its own axis of rotation (B) by means of an actuating member (38) in order to axially displace the tappet. The axis of rotation (B) is at least approximately parallel to the brake disk. Linking gears arranged between the rotary body (42) and the first screw body (58) have a right-angle gear drive and a coupling device (90) which transmit a limited torque for readjusting said brake shoe.

<CLAIMS>
An actuating device with automatic readjustment on disc 
brakes, especially for trucks and buses, comprising 


a casing (30) which is disposed axially beside a brake disc 
(10) in built-in position, 
a first threaded member (58) which is supported in the 
casing (30) for rotation about a screw axis (C; C'; C") in 

parallel with the axis (A) of the brake disc (10), 
a second threaded member (66) which is fixed against rotation 
and connected to the first threaded member (58) by a 

readjustment thread pair (68) so that the two threaded members 
(58, 66) together form a longitudinally adjustable tappet for 

exerting an actuating force on a brake pad (22), 
a rotary member (42) which is rotatable about an axis of rotation 
(B) of its own for axially displacing the tappet by 

means of an actuator member (38), and 
a gear connection between the rotary member (42) and the 
first threaded member (58), comprising a coupling arrangement 

(90) which transmits a limited torque for readjustment of the 
brake pad mentioned, 
characterized
 in that 
the axis of rotation (B) of the rotary member (42) is disposed 
at least approximately parallel to the brake disc (10), 
the gear connection between the rotary member (42) and the 
first threaded member (58) comprises an angular drive, 
the rotary member (42) is at least approximately symmetrical 
with respect to a plane of symmetry (E) which contains the 

axis (A) of the brake disc (10), 
the rotary member (42) has a recess (70) into which projects 
that end portion of the second threaded member (66) which is 

remote from said brake pad (22). 
The actuating device as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the recess (70) is located centrally in the rotary 

member (42).  
 
The actuating device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the rotary member (42) is supported at 

either side of the plane of symmetry (E) by a respective journal 
pin (46) in a cover (32) of the casing (30). 
The actuating device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the rotary member (42) comprises an 

eccentric (44) each at both sides of the plane of symmetry 
(E). 
The actuating device as claimed in claim 4, characterized 
in that a respective roller body (54; 134) is supported on 

each eccentric (44) for power transmission to the corresponding 
threaded member (58). 
The actuating device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that a readjustable tappet each is arranged 

at both sides of the plane of symmetry (E), being axially 
displaceable by rotation of the rotary member (42) and 

comprising a first threaded member (58) and a second threaded 
member (66) for joint exertion of an actuating force on said 

brake pad (22). 
The actuating device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the gear connection between the 

coupling arrangement (90) and the second threaded member (66) 
of the or each tappet comprises toothings (114, 118) formed at 

the coupling arrangement (90) and at the first threaded member 
(58). 
The actuating device as claimed in claim 6 in combination 
with claim 7, characterized in that 


the readjustment thread pairs (68) of the two tappets have 
the same course of thread with respect to each other, and 
the two first threaded members (58) of both tappets (58, 
66) are interconnected by an intermediate gear (116) for synchronized 

rotation. 
The actuating device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
8, characterized in that the angular drive is constituted by 

meshing bevel gear toothings (76, 78) with which the rotary 
member (42) and the coupling arrangement (90) are formed.
