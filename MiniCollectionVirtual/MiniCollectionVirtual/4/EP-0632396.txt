<ABSTRACT>
A method and system for providing a substitute font 
that visually approximates a selected font that is unavailable 

in a computer system is provided. In a preferred embodiment 
of the present invention, the method and system first selects 

as the substitute font a font that is available in the 
computer system. The method and system then adjusts the 

overall widths of the characters of the substitute font to 
match the overall widths of the corresponding characters of 

the selected font. This causes the same combinations of 
characters of the substitute font and of the selected font to 

have substantially the same size and appearance. The method 
and system then makes the substitute font available to a 

program that has requested the selected font.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to a method and 
system for providing computer fonts, and, more 
specifically, to a method and system for providing a 
substitute computer font for a font that is unavailable 
within a computer system. Most general purpose computer systems 
(computers) are able to display text, comprised of 
characters (letters, numerals, and other symbols), on 
attached display devices, such as monitors and printers. 
A monitor consists of a grid of points, or pixels, each of 
which can be individually illuminated. Computer printers 
and other computer display devices also use pixels to 
display images. In order to display text on a display device, 
computers use one or more raster fonts. A raster font is 
comprised of character bitmaps. Each character bitmap 
contains data reflecting which pixels in a subset of the 
display grid must be illuminated in order to form a 
particular character. When a computer needs to display a 
particular character at a display location, it accesses 
the bitmap for that character. The computer then turns 
the illumination of pixels near the display position on or 
off in accordance with the data stored in the character 
bitmap. Figure 1A is a diagram showing how one possible 
bitmap of the letter A could be displayed on a display 
device. At one point, computers each used only a single 
raster font, permanently stored in read only memory. 
Since then, computers have been adapted to use several  
 
different raster fonts simultaneously. This permits a 
user to display text in more than one typeface and point 
size. (A typeface is a specific design for a set of 
characters. Point size is a measurement of the height of 
a font's characters.) These raster fonts are now stored 
in writeable random access memory, which allows existing 
raster fonts to be altered and new raster fonts added. Computers now also use another, more robust type 
of font, called outline fonts. Outline fonts contain an 
outline for each character, comprised of straight lines 
and curves that form the shape of the character's outline. 
Figure 1B is a diagram showing one possible outline of the 
letter A. The outline font describes these straight lines 
and curves in terms of an arbitrary system of coordinates. 
The computer can resize these character outlines to any 
point size, then convert them to a raster font. Outline 
fonts also contain hints, which are routines that, when 
executed, adjust the shapes of the outlines for various 
point sizes to improve their appearance. Computers use
