<ABSTRACT>
A chamber for freeze-drying by cryosorption with liquid nitrogen cooling in a Dewar vessel (1), in which the chamber (8-10, 18, 19) is largely in the Dewar vessel (1), preferably in its neck, and its preferably cylindrical outer wall (9) is of metal, the lower edge of which is vacuumtightly secured to lower edge of a metal and preferably symmetrical in rotation component (8). The plane underside of the metal component (8) has a contact surface (25) which corresponds to the equally plane complementary surface (7) on the top of a body around which flows liquid nitrogen and is cooled by this component, the component (8) having a chamber (30) to accept the dessiccant (31) for cryosorption, e.g. a molecular sieve, and a connection (45) with the drying chamber (34). The upper edge of the metal wall (9) or a ring (10) vacuumtightly secured thereto is outside the Dewar vessel (1) and is therefore at approximately room temperature and has a vacuum connector (14) for the connection of commercially available vacuum components, and the aperture on the upper side of the ring (10) can be vacuumtightly sealed preferably by a commercially available O-ring together with a cover (19).

(34) consists of a metal wall (9) and the drying chamber (34) is constructed to be vacuum-tightly

closable by way of a ring (10), characterised thereby that the drying chamber (34) is
arranged for the major part in the neck of the Dewar flask (1) and the lower edge of the

metal wall (9) is vacuum-tightly connected with the lower edge of a metallic part (8), and
the underside of the metallic part (8) has a contact surface (25), which is connected with a

heat-conductive body (6) washed around by liquid nitrogen, wherein the metallic part (8) is
cooled down by the heat-conductiv
e body (6) and the metallic part (8) has a drying means
chamber (30) for reception of the drying means (31) for the cryosorption, for example a

microfilter, as well as a connecting channel (45), which is switchable by way of a valve
(47/48), for the drying chamber (34), and the upper edge of the metal wall (9) together with

the ring (10) is disposed outside the Dewar flask (1) and accordingly approaches room
temperature.
Equipment according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the metal walls (9)
consists of a thin sheet metal, preferably in a thickness of 0.2 mm to 1 mm.
Equipment according to claim 2, characterised thereby that the sheet metal is a

Equipment according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised thereby that the height
of the metal wall (9) amounts to at least 100 mm.
Equipment according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised thereby that the
metallic part (8) has an opening, which is vacuum-tightly closable by a cover (32) and

preferably with a metal ring seal (33), for refilling or exchanging of drying means (31).
Equipment according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised thereby that the ring
(10) has at least one vacuum connection (14) for connection of commercially available

vacuum components, wherein the opening at the upper side of the ring (10) is vacuum-tightly 
closable preferably by a commercially available 0-ring (18) in conjunction with a

cover (19).
Equipment according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised thereby that a plate (35
of metal which has good thermal conductivity is provided for reception of the frozen

samples (37), which plate is thermostatically heatable by means of a heating cartridge (38)
as well as a temperature sensor (39) and has at least one trough (36) at its upper side for

reception and embedding of the samples (37) and is connected with the metallic part (8) in
such a manner that a high thermal resistance results between the plate (35) and the

metallic part (8) when the drying chamber (34) is evacuated.
Equipment according to claim 7, characterised thereby that the connection
between the metallic part (8) and the sample plate (35) is effected by way of tip supports
