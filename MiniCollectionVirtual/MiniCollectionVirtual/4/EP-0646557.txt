<ABSTRACT>
Direct fluorination of organics such as 1,8-dichlorooctane in 
tubular reactor system. 

Inert liquid containing organic feed is circulated through tubular 
reactor with fluorine gas for a time and at a temperature sufficient to yield 

fluorinated organic. Preferably, liquid and gas phases are separated from 
reactor product stream containing inert liquid, fluorinated organic, and any 

unreacted organic is recycled to turbulent mixing zone upstream of reactor in 
which fresh organic feed is added; and fluorine is added to recycle stream at 

end of mixing zone. Flow in tubular reactor is turbulent. Rate of organic feed 
and fluorine addition to process are independent of each other. Among process 

advantages are: Freon solvents not required; good control of reaction 
exotherm; and HF scavengers not required. Process useful for partial or 

complete fluorination.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to process and apparatus for fluorination of 
organic substances in inert liquid media. In another aspect, it relates to 
reactions carried out in a tubular reactor system containing a recycle loop. Fluorochemical compounds (sometimes called organofluorine compounds 
or fluorochemicals) are a class of substances which contain portions that are 
fluoroaliphatic or fluorocarbon in nature, e.g., nonpolar, hydrophobic, 
oleophobic, and chemically inert, and which may contain other portions that are 
functional in nature, e.g., polar and chemically reactive. The class includes 
some commercial substances which are familiar to the general public, such as 
those which give oil and water repellency and stain and soil resistance to 
textiles. An industrial process for producing organofluorine compounds is the 
electrochemical fluorination process commercialized initially in the 1950s by 
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company. This fluorination process, 
commonly referred to as the "Simons electrochemical fluorination process," is a 
highly energetic process which uses anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Another process for producing fluorochemical compounds is direct 
fluorination, but it is not significantly used today as an industrial process. In 
direct fluorination, the highly exothermic reaction of fluorine, F2, with organic 
compounds is accompanied by quick evolution of heat and possibly by one or 
more of such phenomena as carbon-carbon scission or fragmentation, polymer 
formation, ignition, combustion, and violent explosion, the heat removal being 
the main problem in direct fluorination -- see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 
4,523,039 (Lagow et al.) and Kirk-Othmer "Encyclopedia of Chemical 
Technology", 3rd Ed., Vol. 10, pages 636, 840-855, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 
New York (1980). Various diverse fluorination methods or techniques which  
 
have been proposed to overcome problems in direct fluorination are dilution of 
the fluorine with an inert gas, use of low temperatures, use of inert solvents to 
dissipate heat, use of partially-fluorinated starting materials, dilution of the 
organic feed, use of hydrogen fluoride scavengers, and combinations of these 
techniques. A review article on direct fluorination is that of Lagow et al. in Progress 
in Inorganic Chemistry26, 161-210(1979). Recent advances in direct 
fluorination are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,859,747 
(Bierschenk et al.), 4,973,716 (Calini et al.), 5,076,949 (Kalota et al.),
