<ABSTRACT>
A high-performance rectifying device, in which 
diffusion of energy, temperature and concentration can be 

simultaneously promoted and yet a pressure loss is small, 
is disclosed. In a lattice type rectifying device equipped 

within a fluid flow passageway for equalizing a flow 
velocity distribution of the same fluid, lattice elements 

each consisting of two triangular plates (1, 1) disposed so 
as to form two opposed surfaces of a pyramid having its apex 

on the downstream side of the fluid flow and other two 
triangular plates (2, 2) forming two opposed surfaces of 

another pyramid having its apex jointed with the first-mentioned 
apex and having its bottom surface positioned on 

the downstream side of the fluid flow, the latter two 
opposed surfaces having their orientations deviated by 90 

degrees from the two opposed surfaces on the upstream side, 
are arrayed in juxtaposition in the directions perpendicular 

to the fluid flow with the orientations of adjacent lattice 
elements deviated by 90 degrees from each other and are 

connected in such manner that the bottom surfaces of the 
above-mentioned pyramids may form a lattice. Furthermore, 

as an essential condition, a ratio (L/B) of a length (L) in 
the direction parallel to the flow of the lattice element to 

a breadth (B) in the direction perpendicular to the flow of  
 

the lattice element should be kept in the range of 1.5 - 
2.0. A modified embodiment, in which a lattice constituent 

element is formed of a rectangular plate twisted by 90 
degrees in the same direction along the direction of the 

fluid flow in place of the assembly of triangular plates, is 
also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rectifying
device which is applicable to an apparatus necessitating to
realize a uniform flow within a predetermined zone of a
fluid flow passageway, such as a denitriding/desulfurizing
apparatus for exhaust gases or a chemical reactor.In the case of an apparatus necessitating a
chemical reaction process in a flow of fluid, such as a
denitriding/desulfurizing apparatus for exhaust gases or a
chemical reactor, in order to efficiently effect the desired
reaction, in many instances it is necessary to control
distributions of a velocity, a temperature and a reactive
substance concentration of the fluid so as to fall within
predetermined ranges.However, in many cases, these apparatuses are
normally positioned in a complicated duct system or a three-dimensional
piping system, consequently large unbalance
would be generated in the flow due to bending, expansion and
contraction of ducts and pipings, and as a result, often we
encounter the case where a reaction performance is degraded.As a counter-measure for the above-mentioned 
disadvantage, in the prior art generally, a system trying to
enhance a rectifying effect by equipping a turbulent lattice
or a perforated plate on the upstream side of a reaction
apparatus to stir and mix the flow, has been employed.However, the above-mentioned system in the prior
art still involved the following problems to be resolved.In order to equalize a flow velocity and
temperature distribution and a concentration distribution in
a flow within a duct or a piping, it is necessary to promote
mixing and diffusion of energy, temperatures and substance,
and so, it is necessitated to generate as large as possible
turbulences (vortexes) in the flow.However, in the case of a turbulent lattice
consisting of a combination of circular or rectangular posts
which has been heretofore utilized frequently, since the
size of generated turbulences is determined by the scale of
constituent elements of the lattice, if it is intended to
get large turbulences, the lattice constituent members
(circular or rectangular posts) and the lattice intervals
must be made large, and therefore, there was a shortcoming
that the scale of the lattice was physically limited and
also a pressure loss was increased.On the other hand, in the case of a perforated
plate, since it is one kind of resistive rectifying device,
although it could reveal an excellent performance for 
equalizing a flow velocity distribution by well investigating
the size and interval of perforations, there was
a
