<ABSTRACT>
Process control method for a strip coating plant in which a metal strip (1) is passed through a container (2) with molten coating material, e.g. zinc, and through a lower channel (3), in which induced currents in the coating material are produced by an electromagnetic travelling field. The induced currents acting together with the electromagnetic travelling field generate an electromagnetic force to hold back the coating material. The novelty is that the electromagnetic travelling field is supplied by inductors (4,5) supplied by at least one inverter with output signals whose frequency can be changed and/or whose amplitude and wave form can be set.

A method for regulating in accordance with the process an installation 
for the coating of material in band form, in which a metal band is guided 

through a container receiving the molten coating material, which beneath the 
level of the melting bath has a feed-through duct in which induction currents are 

induced through an electromagnetic travelling field in the coating material, 
which bring about in alternating action with the electromagnetic travelling field 

an electromagnetic force to hold back the coating material,
 
characterised in that
 
the electromagnetic travelling field is supplied via at least one inverted converter 

with output signals, the frequency of which is able to be altered and/or the 
amplitude and form of which are adjustable. 
A method according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the phase position of the output signals is displaced relative to each other by 

several inverted converters. 
A method according to Claim 1 and 2,
 
characterised in that
 
the supply of the inverted converters with rectified line current takes place from 

at least one power supply and/or for emergency supply of the inverted 
converters a battery voltage is applied. 
A method according to Claim 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that
 
the level of liquid in the container and/or feed-through duct is detected by 

sensor and is used to contol the quantity of the liquid coating material.  
 
A method according to Claim 1 to 4,
 
characterised in that
 
hath turbulences in the liquid coating material are detected by sensor and are 

processed in a logic circuit together with the detected data representing the level 
of liquid in the container and/or feed-through duct and are used to alter the 

frequency or the amplitude of the output signal leaving the inverted converter. 
A method according to Claim 1 to 5,
 
characterised in that
 
the frequency of the output signal leaving the inverted converter is altered as a 

function of the temperature which is measured in the feed-through duct and/or 
container. 
A method according to one or more of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that
 
the travelling field is distributed to several individually supplied coils. 
A method according to one or more of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that
 
the amplitudes or frequencies of several inverted converters are superimposed. 
A method according to one or more of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that
 
to adjust the temperature in the feed-through duct and/or container one or 

more inductors are used, the frequencies of which are adjustable.
