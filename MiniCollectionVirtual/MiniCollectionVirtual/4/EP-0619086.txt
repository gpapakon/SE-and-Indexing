<ABSTRACT>
This is a box comprising a case (4) with its lid (6) with hinge (20, 22), means (14, 30, 58) for controlling the opening of the lid (6), and means (62, 64, 66, 68) for damping the opening movement of the said lid, these means comprising at least one substantially elastically compressible means (62, 64), such as a block of foam and/or a flexing spring, arranged in the box to act during the essential part of the opening travel of the lid by absorbing the energy communicated to the latter in order for it to open. Application, in particular, to powder compacts or make-up boxes.

<CLAIMS>
Compact for a cosmetic, makeup, beauty care or
hygiene product, comprising:


a case (4) and its lid (6), the case being
suitable for containing said product,
a hinge (20, 22) for rotatably articulating the
lid on the case,
members (20, 32) for locking/unlocking a catch
(14) for holding the lid in the closed position,
first spring means (58) compressed in said closed
position of the lid, the relaxing of which, when freed

by unlocking the catch, is adapted to cause the lid to
open abruptly,
and means (62, 64; 76) for damping the movement
of said lid, in order to slow down this opening action

counter to said first spring means,

   characterised in that the damping means comprise:

a second spring (64; 76) acting counter to said
first spring means (58), essentially during a first part

of the opening movement of the lid,

   and a compressible foam block (62) which acts
essentially during a second final part of the movement

of said lid,

   so that the damping means are substantially
elastically compressible and are adapted to be

compressed or relaxed as a function of the relaxation or
compression, respectively, of said first spring means.
Compact according to claim 1, characterised in that
said damping means (62, 64; 76) are arranged in the

compact so as to act progressively during the main part
of the opening movement of the lid (6), thereby

absorbing the energy communicated to the lid for opening
it, by the relaxation of said first spring means (58),

to the point of substantially cancelling out this energy
at the end of the movement. 
Compact according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the second spring (64) is arranged inside a drawer

(36; 36') whilst also bearing against a fixed wall (68)
of the case, said drawer being slidably mounted in the

case (4), under the control of the rotational
articulating movement of the lid (6).
Compact according to claim 3, characterised in that
the drawer (36;36') has a first end close to the

articulating hinge (16,20,22) of the lid (6) and a
second opposite end which incorporates a push button

(30) for causing rotation of a pivoting part (42)
articulating about a fixed axis substantially parallel

to that (18) of the hinge and carried by the case.
Compact according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in
that the second spring (76) is formed integrally, in one

piece, with the drawer (36') and is substantially in the
form of a "Ω", in an unstressed state.
Compact according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the foam block (62) is located

close to the articulating hinge (16,20,22) of the lid.
Compact according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the foam block (62) is located

closer to the articulating hinge of the lid than the
second spring (64) in order to take over after a first

predetermined part of the opening movement of the lid.
Powder compact containing a cosmetic powder and
consisting of the case according to any of the preceding

claims.
