<ABSTRACT>
A method of inspecting an abnormality occurring 
inside a pipe to be inspected and an apparatus for 

practicing the method, includes the steps of transmitting 
an electric wave having a predetermined frequency from an 

antenna of a transmitter located at a predetermined 
position inside the pipe, receiving the transmitted 

electric wave by an antenna of a receiver located at a 
predetermined position inside the pipe, and discriminating 

the characteristic of the received electric wave. The 
characteristic of the received electric wave is the 

intensity of the electric wave, and an attenuation amount 
is detected in the first example. On theother hand, the 

characteristic of the received electric waveis a time 
required to reflect the transmitted electric wave until 

it is received by the receiver, and a time interval 
between transmission of the electric wave and reception of 

the reflected electric wave is measured in the second 
example.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
inspecting abnormality occurring inside a pipe such as a 
gas pipe.buried underground, and an apparatus for 
practicing the method. Known conventional methods of inspecting whether 
a foreign substance such as earth and sand enters into a 
gas pipe or the like buried underground include a method 
of inserting an inspection camera into the pipe to pick 
up the internal state of the pipe and observe the 
resultant image, thereby judging presence/absence of an 
abnormality, or a method of inserting a self-propelling 
robot into a pipe and inspecting the internal state of 
the pipe (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 59-147260). 
Further, a method of inserting a pig having an outer 
diameter almost equal to the inner diameter of a pipe to 
be inspected into the pipe is known. Still further, a 
method of sending a sound wave into a pipe to be 
inspected and receiving the reflected sound wave, thereby 
checking the internal state of the pipe (Japanese Patent  
 
Publication No. 51-18836) is known also. In the above methods, however, when the camera, 
robot, and the like are used for inspecting the interior 
of a pipe, they cannot be applied to such a pipe as 
having a complicated bent shape. In addition, an 
insertion hole is required to insert the above inspecting 
means. To prepare the buried pipe for the insertion 
hole, cumbersome, time-consuming construction works such 
as digging must be involved. In addition, the inspection 
distance per cycle is limited to the length of an 
electric wire or the like connected to the robot or the 
like. For this reason, when the distance to be inspected 
is long, the number of inspection cycles are undesirably 
increased, thereby requiring high cost. When the sound 
wave is sent into a pipe to inspect the internal state 
from the reflected sound wave, it is difficult to sense 
the internal state except that the pipe is completely 
closed or open to air, and a small change cannot be 
detected. The present invention has been made in consideration 
of the above situation, and has as its first object 
to provide a method of easily inspecting an abnormality 
occurring inside a pipe such as a gas pipe or the like 
buried underground, and an apparatus for practicing the  
 
method. The second object of the present invention is to 
provide a method of easily accurately detecting a position 
where an abnormality has occurred inside a pipe as an 
inspection target, and an apparatus for practicing the 
method. In order to achieve the above
