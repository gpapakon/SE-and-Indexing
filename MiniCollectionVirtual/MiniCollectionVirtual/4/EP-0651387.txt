<ABSTRACT>
In an optical information recording/reproducing 
apparatus, relative movement between an optical head 

and an optical information recording medium having a 
linear track is performed to cause a light beam 

irradiated by the optical head to follow the 
information track so as to effect 

recording/reproduction of information. The apparatus 
is provided with an ultrasonic wave motor for driving 

one of the recording medium and the optical head 
relative to each other. The ultrasonic wave motor is 

controlled to gradually decrease a drive velocity 
thereof at the end of a drive operation thereof and to 

gradually increase the drive velocity thereof at the 
beginning of the drive operation thereof by properly 

adjusting an amplitude of a drive signal to be supplied 
to the ultrasonic wave motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical 
information recording/reproduction method and apparatus 
for optically recording/reproducing information on/from 
a card-shaped recording medium. Conventionally, as different shapes of a recording 
medium on which information is optically recorded or 
from which recorded information is optically read out, 
various shapes such as a disk shape, a card shape, and 
the like are known. Of these information recording 
media, a card-shaped recording medium (to be referred 
to as an optical card hereinafter) is expected to be in 
great demand in the future since it is compact, 
lightweight, and convenient to carry, and has a large 
recording capacity. When information is recorded on a recording medium 
such as an optical card, a light beam, which is 
modulated in accordance with recording information and 
is focused to a very small light spot, is scanned on an 
information track, thereby recording the information as 
an optically detectable recorded pit string. Upon 
recording of information, in order to accurately record  
 
information without causing a trouble such as crossing 
on an information track, auto-tracking control is 
performed to control the irradiation position of the 
light beam in the track intersecting direction, so that 
the light beam is scanned to follow the information 
track. Of course, upon reproduction of information, 
auto-tracking control is performed to control the light 
beam to be scanned to follow the information track. Fig. 1 is a diagram showing an example of an 
optical card recording/reproduction apparatus for 
recording/reproducing information on/from an optical 
card. Referring to Fig. 1, an optical card 100 as an 
information recording medium is placed on a shuttle 
101. The shuttle 101 is movable in the track 
intersecting direction by driving an ultrasonic wave 
motor (to be abbreviated as a USM hereinafter) 103. As 
will be described later, correction control with 
respect to a skew of the optical card 100 is realized 
by moving a light beam in the track intersecting 
direction under the control of a USM control circuit 
104. A semiconductor laser 105 is a 
recording/reproduction light source, and a collimator 
lens 106 collimates a light beam emitted from the 
semiconductor laser 105. A light beam emitted from the semiconductor laser 
105 is incident on an objective lens 108 via the 
collimator lens 106 and a polarization beam splitter  
 
107, and is focused to a very small light spot by the 
objective lens 108. The optical
