<ABSTRACT>
Method for protecting leucocytes, characterised in that a blood sample previously treated with an anticoagulant is treated with a leucocyte-protecting composition containing an agent for the attachment (binding) of leucocytes prior to hypotonic lysis of the erythrocytes, composition for protecting the leucocytes, protected blood composition, and method for leucocyte analysis.

A method for protecting leucocyte cells, characterized in that a
blood sample which has been pre-treated with an anticoagulant is treated

using a leucocyte protective composition comprising a leucocyte fixative
prior to a hypotonic lysis of the erythrocytes.
A method for protecting leucocyte cells, characterized in that a
blood sample which has been pre-treated with an anticoagulant, is treated

using a substantially isotonic or hypertonic composition comprising:

an aliphatic aldehyde,
a salt of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal and a weak acid,
if necessary, an agent to render the composition isotonic.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
sample is treated with an antibody specific for at least one lymphocyte

subpopulation before the treatment with the protective preparation
A method according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that
the lysis is carried out at least one minute after the sample is brought into

contact with the protective preparation.
Composition for the protection of leucocytes in a blood sample
treated with an anticoagulant, characterized in that it comprises:


an aliphatic aldehyde chosen from acetaldehyde, butyraldehyde,
formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde,
a salt of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal and a weak acid,
if necessary, an agent to render the composition isotonic

and in that it is substantially isotonic or hypertonic. 
Composition according claim 5, characterized in that the aliphatic
aldehyde is formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde.
Composition according one of claims 5 or 6, characterized in that
the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt of a weak acid is a sodium,

potassium or magnesium salt of acetic, tartaric or formic acid.
Composition according one of claims 5 to 7, characterized in that
in addition it contains a second salt which is a manganese or calcium salt.
Composition of protected blood, characterized in that it
comprises a mixture of a blood sample treated with an anticoagulant and a

composition according to one of claims 5 to 8 containing at least 0.36 M of
aliphatic aldehyde.
A method for analyzing the leucocyte population of a blood
sample in which the blood sample is treated with an anticoagulant, then if

desired, with antibodies specific to at least one leucocyte population or
sub-population; then with a leucocyte fixative and then a hypotonic lysis is

carried out then the sample is analyzed by flow cytometry, characterized
in that after treatment with the anticoagulant and if desired at least one

labelled antibody, the sample is treated with a substantially isotonic or
hypertonic composition containing:


a fixative which is an aliphatic aldehyde,
a salt of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal and a weak acid,
if necessary, an agent to render the composition isotonic,

then at least one minute after treatment of the sample with the
substantially isotonic or hypertonic composition, said sample is lyzed

under hypotonic conditions.
