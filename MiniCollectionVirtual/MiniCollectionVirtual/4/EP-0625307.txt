<DESCRIPTION>
Soilborne phytopathogenic fungi cause 
diseases which infest and infect growing and harvested 
crops and crop seed. Among the present methods used to 
combat the harmful effects of soilborne fungi are seed 
soak and seed drench practices. However, such practices 
have led to resistance problems, i.e., the target 
fungi develop resistant strains causing a loss of 
effectiveness of the fungicidal agent in use. Further, 
fungi such as Fusarium cause diseases which are difficult 
to control and result in significant reductions in 
yield and grain quality. Fusarium are also the sources 
of toxins produced in stored grains. Therefore, 
agriculturists continue to seek new, effective means of 
controlling soilborne phytopathogenic fungi and new 
compositions which would overcome resistance problems. Simple aminothiazolylthiocyanates have been 
used for nearly a century as synthetic intermediates in 
heterocyclic chemistry and certain derivatives have 
been described as antibacterial agents, i.e., JP 
74031096. However, there are no examples or teaching 
in the art of the use of 2-amino-5-thiazolyl thiocyanates 
and their derivatives for preventing, controlling 
or ameliorating soilborne phytopathogenic fungi.  
 
The use of 2-formamido-5-thiocyanatothiazoles and 
2-acetamido-5-thiocyanatothiazoles for the control of 
medical pathogens such as Trichophyton and Candida and 
foliar pathogens such as Piricularia oryzae and 
Alternariasolani is described in Gifu Yakka Daigaku 
Kiyo, No. 12, 27-33(1962), (CA 58 14635d). However, 
the control, prevention or amelioration of soilborne 
pathogens by the use of 2-amido-5-thiocyanatothiazoles 
is not disclosed therein. Therefore, it is an object of this invention 
to provide effective methods and compositions for the 
control, prevention or amelioration of soil fungal 
infestations utilizing 2-amino-5-thiazolyl ester 
thiocyanic acid compounds and derivatives thereof. It is a further object of this invention to 
protect crops, both growing and harvested, from the 
damages caused by infestation and infection due to 
soilborne phytopathogenic fungi. The present invention provides a method for 
the control, prevention or amelioration of soilborne 
phytopathogenic fungi which comprises contacting said 
fungi with a fungicidally effective amount of a 
compound of formula I 
wherein 
Ris hydrogen, C₁-C₈alkyl optionally 
substituted with one or more halogen or 
C₁-C₄alkoxy groups or 
CXR₁;  Xis oxygen or sulfur and R₁is hydrogen, C₁-C₄alkoxy optionally substituted with 
one or
