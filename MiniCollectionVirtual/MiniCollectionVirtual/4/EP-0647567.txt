Container (1) made of synthetic material, especially
bottle (1), comprising:


a hollow body (2) which is intended to receive a product to
be stored and conveyed and which includes a bottom zone (4),

and
a base (7) which presents a putting down surface (8) for the
bottle (1) and which is fixed to the hollow body (2) in at

least one fixing point (9) presenting a reduced size compared
with the bottom zone (4),

outside the fixing point or points (9), the container (1)
presenting, between the rest of the base (7) and the hollow body

(2), a gap (10) for a natural flow of a fluid,

characterized in that the base (7) presents, at least around an end
portion (13) of the bottom zone (4), a form of open sleeve at its

two ends, which extends roughly parallel to the longitudinal axis
(12) of the container (1) and which includes hence, on its putting

down surface (8) side, a hole (24) of large section compared with
the putting down surface (8).
Container according to claim 1, characterized in
that the base (7) comprises reinforcing ribs (19, 20) which are

distributed over the external face (21) and/or over the internal
face (22) and which each extend parallel to the above-mentioned

longitudinal axis (12), over at least part of the corresponding
face (21, 22) and in that, if applicable, a gap (10) is provided

between the hollow body (2) and at least most of each reinforcing
rib (20) of the aforementioned internal face (22).
Container according to claim 2, characterized in
that the base (7) comprises, fixed to its internal face (22), an

annular reinforcing collar (23) which extends roughly parallel to
the putting down surface (8) and towards the inside of the base (7)

from the internal face (22) and whose collar faces turned
respectively one towards the filling hole (6) of the container (1)

and the other towards the putting down surface (8) are both
inclined in relation to a plans perpendicular to the longitudinal

axis (12) and included between these two faces of the collar (23),
the inclination of the latter moving them closer to each other and

to this perpendicular plane as one moves away radially from the 
internal face (22) towards the longitudinal axis (12), and in that

a gap (10) is provided between the hollow body (2) and the collar
(23).
Container (1) according to any one of the claims 1
to 3, characterized in that a projection of the base (7) upon a

plane passing through the putting down surface (8) is included in
a projection of the hollow body (2) upon the same plane or roughly

coincides with this latter projection.
Container (1) according to any one of the claims 1
to 4, characterized in that the hollow body (2) presents a roughly

cylindrical section (11) with axis (12) practically perpendicular
to the said putting down surface (8), and in that the bottom zone

(4) connected to this cylindrical section (11) presents an end
portion (13) at least partly roughly in the form of a portion of

a sphere which is coaxial with the cylindrical section (11) and
whose concave side is turned towards the latter.
Container according to claim 5, characterized in
that the aforementioned portion of a sphere is flattened (at 14)

in the vicinity of its intersection with the said axis (12).
Container according to either of the claims 5 and
6, characterized in that the said end portion (13) in the form of

a portion of a sphere presents a cross section (III-III) which is
greater than the other cross sections of this same end portion (13)

but less than the cross section of the cylindrical section (11),
and in that, for the connection between this end 
portion (13) and
the cylindrical section (11), the bottom zone (4) presents moreover

an intermediate zone (15) whose cross section decreases towards the
end portion (13), progressively and/or in steps, from the cross

section of the cylindrical section (11) to the cross section (III-III)
of the said end portion (13).
Container (1) according to any one of the claims 1
to 7, characterized in that the base (7) includes at least three

supports (17) arranged to locate the hollow body (2) in relation
to the base (7), at least during an operation to fix one to the

other, so as to form the above-mentioned gap (10).
Container (1) according to any one of the claims 5
to 7, characterized in that the base (7) forms a hollow element of

revolution (16) which, in the fixed to the hollow body (2) state,
is coaxial with the cylindrical section (11) and surrounds at least 

the end portion (13) in the form of a portion of a sphere, the
putting down surface (8) of the base (7) being situated beyond the

intersection between the portion of a sphere (13) and the above-mentioned
axis (12), opposite the aforementioned cylindrical

section (11).
Container (1) according to any one of the claims 1
to 9, characterized in that the fixing point or points (9) between

hollow body (2) and base (7) are constituted by spots of adhesive
resistant to solutions for washing the container and to thermal

stresses, and in that the adhesive presents in the hardened state
an expansion compared with its application state on the elements

(2, 7) to be bonded, the gap (10) between hollow body (2) and base
(7) being produced or increased by that after the adhesive has

hardened.
Container (1) according to any one of the claims 1
to 10, characterized in that the synthetic material of the hollow

body (2) is biaxially stretched, possibly with more than 30%
crystallinity, advantageously with approximately 40% crystallinity,

preferably relieved of internal stresses, especially in the bottom
zone (4), this synthetic material being advantageously polyethylene

terephthalate.
