<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for detecting pulse waves and motion intensity of a living body in 
motion is disclosed. The apparatus has photosensors (1, 2) of the photo-coupler 

type, for 
typically wavelengths of 660 nm and 940 nm, respectively. The sensors (1, 2) are 

attached to a person under examination, and provide output signals Sa and Sb which 
include a blood pulse signal as well as body motion components superimposed on the 

blood pulse signal. These signals Sa and Sb are subjected to Fourier transformation in a 
fast Fourier transformation circuit (3), and then applied to a comparator (4) which in 

turn compares amplitudes of major frequency components (components associated with 
pulse waves and body motion) to one another. According to the comparison result, a 

decision circuit (5) discriminates the pulse wave from the body motion. A display unit 
(6) displays the pulse rate corresponding to the fundamental frequency of the detected 

pulse wave. The display unit (6) also displays the change in motion intensity detected by 
the decision circuit (5). Thus, the present invention allows the detection of the change in 

motion intensity during the exercise of a person under the examination.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a blood pulse wave detecting apparatus and
motion intensity measuring apparatus. In particular, but not exclusively, the present
invention performs accurate and reliable detection of the blood pulse rate, blood pulse
waves, or motion intensity of a living body which is even in motion.There are various types of known apparatus for detecting the blood pulse rate or
blood pulse waves of a living body. However, most of these apparati can provide accurate
detection only when a living body is at rest. This is because if the living body moves, a
mixture of blood pulse wave and body movement is detected and it is impossible to
extract the blood pulse wave.The detection of the blood pulse rate or blood pulse waves of a living body is very
important for control of excersizing or for health care. Therefore, there is a great need to
achieve accurate blood pulse detection of a living body in motion.One of the conventional blood pulse rate detectors is disclosed in Japanese Patent
Publication No. 63-34731. When a pulse, showing a deviation from an average value,
by an amount greater than an allowable limit is detected, the detection is cancelled so that
only normal pulses can be detected. With this apparatus, extraordinary pulses arising,
when a living body moves slightly for a short time, can be effectively cancelled, and thus
only normal pulses can be detected.In the conventional apparatus, however, if the living body makes continuous
motions, the pulse will change very often and thus the detection will be cancelled so often
that accurate detection of pulses will become impossible.If the motion intensity of a living body in motion, in particular of a human body,
can be measured, it will be possible to advantageously control the amount of motion.
However, conventional techniques cannot measure the intensity of motion.EP 0379140A describes an arrangement for detecting information of a subject,
such as blood pressure.DE 4001574A is concerned with blood pulse analysis by means of frequency
measurement.In view of the above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a blood
pulse wave detecting apparatus which can distinguish blood pulses from body motion.It is another object of the present invention to provide a motion intensity detecting
apparatus for detecting the motion intensity of a living body.According to the present invention to achieve the above objects,
there is provided an apparatus for measuring a blood pulse wave and/or motion intensity
of a living organism, said
