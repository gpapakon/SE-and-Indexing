<ABSTRACT>
A construction for automatically milking animals 
comprises a milk box (3) having a milking robot and at least 

two further boxes (1, 2) which may be designed for cleaning 
and massaging the animals. The boxes (1 to 3) may be in 

alignment, whilst the animal can pass therethrough in one 
direction only. The milk box (3) will be the last box to be 

passed through.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a construction
for automatically milking animals, such as cows,
according to the preamble of claim 1.Such a construction is known from NL-A-8602505.
In this known construction the animals are
firstly submitted to a cleaning operation, then to a milk
sampling operation and finally to a milking operation by
means of a milking robot.The disadvantage of the above-mentioned construction
is that sometimes the animals do not feel comfortable
during stay in the boxes.The invention has for its object to provide a
construction as described above, in which the animals
feel comfortable and in which it is possible to treat the
animals in the different boxes in the most efficient way.According to the invention this is achieved by
the features of the characterising part of
claim 1. It may happen that animals present in a box
other than the milk box are still denied access to the
milk box. According to the invention it is then possible for the animals to
leave the said first boxes without passing through the
milk box.From document EP-A-0 188 303 there is
known a construction with a first box in which the udder
of the animal is cleaned and a second box in which the
animal is automatically milked by means of a milking
robot. In the milking box there is arranged a feed trough
in which, during milking, feed is supplied to the animal.
Especially with high productive animals the milking time
is sometimes not long enough for the animal to eat all
the feed in the feed trough. With the construction
according to the invention, as already explained above,
the feeding time is independent of the milking time, as
the animal can also eat in the other boxes.According to the invention, the boxes can
therefore be disposed such that the animals can pass
therethrough in one direction only, whilst of the consecutive
boxes through which the animals are to pass, the
milk box will usually be the last one. In order to render
possible a full capacity utilization of the milk box, which
as regards cost price is so much more expensive, any
treatment of an animal in each of the boxes through
which the animal is to pass first will be of a shorter duration
than the treatment of this animal in the milk box.According to the invention, in a practical
embodiment the boxes are aligned in the longitudinal
direction. The boxes which are contiguous to each other
in the longitudinal direction, can be put in connection
with each other by means of upwardly movable partitions.
More in particular, the entrance of the first box an

<CLAIMS>
A construction for automatically milking animals, such
as cows, comprising a milk box (3) with a milking robot,

while the construction includes at least two further boxes
(1, 2), said boxes (1 to 3) being disposed and arranged such

that the animals in the boxes (1 to 3) can be subjected to
consecutive different treatments, the boxes (1 to 3) being

equipped, in this sequence, for cleaning, massaging and
milking of the animals, the boxes (1 to 3)

being arranged one after the other,
the arrangement being such that

each animal which passes a box (1, 2) previous to the milk
box (3) will pass the milk box (3) or is given the

possibility to leave said box (1, 2) previous to the milk box
(3) without passing through the milk box (3), 
characterized
in that
 said boxes (1, 2, 3) each include a feed
trough and 
in that
 the boxes
(1, 2), in which cleaning and massaging can be performed, are

provided with an exit (17, 18) for the animals, located in the
side wall of these boxes (1, 2).
A construction as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
in that
, the boxes (1 to 3) are disposed such that the
animals can pass therethrough in one direction

only.
A construction as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
in that
 of the consecutive boxes (1 to 3)
through which the animals are to pass, the milk box

(3) is the last one.
A construction as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized
in that
 any treatment of an animal in each of the
boxes (1 to 3) through which the animal is to pass

first is of a shorter duration than the treatment of
this animal in the milk box (3).
A construction as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 all the boxes (1 to 
3) are aligned in the longitudinal direction.
A construction as claimed in claim 5, 
characterized
in that
 it comprises three boxes (1 to 3) which are
contiguous to each other in the longitudinal direction

and can be put into connection with each other
by means of upwardly movable partitions (8, 9).
A construction as claimed in claim 6, 
characterized
in that
 the entrance (10) of the box (1) through
which an animal is to pass first and the exit (11) of

the box (3) through which an animal is to pass last
are positioned at the short sides of the boxes (1, 3),

while both the entrance (10) and the exit (11) are
constituted by an upwardly movable partition (12).
A construction as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the feed troughs
(15) are attached to one or more upwardly movable

partitions (18, 9) between individual boxes (1, 2; 2,
3) and/or to the exit (11), constituted by an upwardly

movable partition (12), of the box (3) through which
an animal is to pass last.
A construction as claimed in any one of claims 6 to
8, 
characterized in that
 there are present three
boxes (1 to 3) and three feed troughs (15), attached

to the partition (18, 9) between the boxes (1, 2; 2, 3)
and to the exit (11) of the box (3) through which an

animal is to pass last.
A construction as claimed in any one of claims 6 to
9, 
characterized in that
 the partition (18, 9) between
the boxes (1, 2; 2, 3) and the partition (12) constituting

the entrance (10) of the box (1) through which
an animal has to pass first, have means (16)

attached thereto for moving the animal to a more
defined position in the longitudinal direction of the

boxes (1 to 3).
A construction as claimed in any one of claims 6 to
10, 
characterized in that
, an upwardly movable partition
(8, 9, 12) is equipped with a four-bar linkage

(13) for moving at least the relevant feed trough (15)
upwardly without any worthwhile change in its position.
