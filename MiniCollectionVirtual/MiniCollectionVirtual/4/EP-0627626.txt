<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for detecting viral or bacterial antigens and to a kit for carrying out this method. The method according to the invention permits intra- or extracellular viral or bacterial antigens to be detected in biological material, entailing the detection of fluorescence-labelled antigen-antibody complexes by flow cytometry. The method according to the invention permits rapid, simple and low-cost detection of antigens associated with various pathological states such as AIDS.

A method for detecting intracellular or extracellular 
viral or bacterial antigens in biological material, 

characterized in that after carrying out one or more 
antigen-antibody reactions and/or a secondary labelling 

of one or more antigen-antibody complexes with 
fluorescent labelled antibodies, the one or more 

fluorescent labelled antigen-antibody complexes are 
detected by means of flow-cytometry, with the proviso 

that the labelling of the antigen-antibody complexes 
does not include the use of beads. 
The method according to claim 1, comprising the 
following steps: 


(a) lysis of the cell membranes of cell populations 
containing viruses and/or bacteria while maintaining 

the antigens to be examined; 
(b) carrying out one or more antigen-antibody reactions 
with a fluorescent labelled antibody for detecting an 

unspecific reation; 
(c) carrying out one or more antigen-antibody reactions 
for detecting a specific reaction; 
(d) secondary fluorescence labelling of one or more 
antigen-antibody complexes of step (c) via a 

fluorescent labelled antibody; 
(e) enrichment and purification of the antigen-antibody 
complexes obtained by step (d); and 
(f) flow-cytometric examination and analysis of the 
antigen-antibody complexes obtained by step (e). 
The method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that a trypsin solution is used for the lysis of 

the cell membranes.  
 
The method according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the viral or bacterial antigens 

are detected by means of 

(a) adjusted instruments of flow-cytometric analysis 
and/or 
(b) configured software for evaluating the results of 
the flow-cytometric analysis and/or 
(c) a measurement with or without defined "gates". 
The method according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the fluorescent labelled antibody is labelled with FITC. 
The method according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the compensation FL3-%FL2 is 0.0 to 0.5 %. 
The method according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the detected antigen is 

detected in human biological material. 
The method according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that a combination of antibodies is 

used for detecting various viral or bacterial antigens. 
The method according to any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the detected antigen stems from 

the HIV virus. 
The method according to any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the detected antigen is p24.  

 
A kit for use in the method according to any of claims 1 
to 10, comprising a trypsin solution, a labelled 

antibody, an unlabelled antibody specific for the 
antigen to be detected and, optionally, a buffer 

solution, with the proviso that the labelling of the 
antigen-antibody complexes does not include the use of 

beads.
