<ABSTRACT>
Exterior wall connection box (1) which can be inserted into an aperture in a wall of the movable room and forms an exhaust gas chamber (2) and a combustion air chamber (3) which are connectable, on the room side, to the exhaust gas channel (4) and combustion air channel (5), respectively, and have, on the outside, an exhaust gas outlet opening (6) and combustion air opening (11), respectively, which lead to the open air, a cover (9) which lies, externally, at a distance from the wall being provided and the exhaust gas outlet opening (6) of the exhaust gas chamber (2) lying in the region between wall and cover (9). There is provision for the combustion air chamber (3) by way of its combustion air opening (11) to pass frontally through the cover (9), for the cover (9) to extend in the radial direction beyond the radially outer enclosure of the chambers (2, 3), and for the exhaust gas chamber (2) by way of its exhaust gas outlet opening (6) in the lower region to open into the annular interspace (8) defined by the cover (9) lying at a distance from the room wall, together with the enclosure.

<CLAIMS>
Exterior wall connection box for a combustion air and 
exhaust gas duct of an appliance with a burner system 

such as in particular a heater, refrigerator or 
similar installed in a transportable room, said 

exterior wall connection box having a flange (7), by 
means of which it may be inserted into an opening in a 

wall of the transportable room, and forming an exhaust 
gas chamber (2) and a combustion air chamber (3), 

which may be connected to the exhaust air duct and 
combustion air duct respectively on the room side and 

on the outside have an exhaust gas outlet (6) and a 
combustion air opening (11) respectively leading into 

the open air, and a cover (9) located at a distance 
from the flange (7) is provided, the exhaust gas 

opening (6) of the exhaust gas chamber (2) lying in 
the area between the flange (7) and the cover (9), 

characterised in that with its combustion air opening 
(11) said combustion air chamber (3) passes through 

the cover (9) on the face side; that said cover (9) 
extends in a radial direction beyond the radially 

outer enclosure of said chambers (2, 3); and that said 
exhaust gas chamber (2) feeds at its exhaust gas 

outlet (6) in the lower area into the annular gap (8) 
defined by said cover (9) located at a distance from 

said flange (7) together with the enclosure. 
Exterior wall connection box according to Claim 1, 
characterised in 
that the cover (9) is angled off in 
axial direction towards the gap at its edge.  

 
Exterior wall connection box according to Claim 1 or 
2, characterised in that the combustion chamber (2) 

slopes downwards towards the exhaust gas outlet (6).
