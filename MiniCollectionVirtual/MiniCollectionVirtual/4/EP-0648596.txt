<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a high speed cutting press having balancing weights and/or counterweights (20), the slide (19) and the balancing weight (20) are to be arranged close together, one on top of the other. To achieve this, the balancing weight (20) and the slide (19) are arranged beneath the press drive (21) and are connected one below the other by means of a short-levered set of connecting rods (22). In order furthermore to be able to vary the inherent frequency of a high-speed cutting press with regard to the number of strokes of the latter, at least one linear spring (1) is provided which is situated parallel to the crank mechanism between the press frame (10) and the slide (12) and one end part (13) of which is connected to the slide (12) by means of a lever (8) and the other end part of which is connected to the press frame (10) at a fixed point (2), the lever (8) having two arms and being mounted in a lever bearing point (11) and the lever mounting point (11) being displaceable in the press frame (10) to extend the lever (8).

<CLAIMS>
Press, in particular high-speed cutting press,
having two masses (19, 20) which are moved by means of

a press drive (21) and of which a first mass (19)
undertakes the function of the ram and the second mass

(20) is used for mass balancing, and the two masses
(19, 20) are operatively connected to each other and

are guided linearly in the press frame (10), underneath
the press drive (21), characterized in that the masses

(19, 20) are operatively connected to each other by
means of at least one double-sided lever (24) that is

mounted in the press frame (10), and the second mass
(20) is driven by the press drive.
Press according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the first mass (19) and the second mass (20) are

connected to each other by a mirror-symmetrical lever
system (link system 22).
Press according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the two masses (19, 20) are connected to the

press frame by means of a spring system (1, 2, 3, 4)
which is formed between the press frame and the

individual masses (19, 20), parallel to the crank drive
(21).
Press according to Claim 3, characterized by at
least one linear spring (1) which is assigned to each

of the two masses (19, 20) and of which one end part
(13) is connected to a mass (12, 20, 21) via a lever

(8) and the other end part is connected to the press
frame at a fixed point (2), and the lever (8) is

designed to have two arms and is mounted at a lever
bearing point (11), which can be displaced in the press

frame (10), in extension of the lever (8).
Press according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the linear spring (1) is a torsion rod with a link

lever (4).
