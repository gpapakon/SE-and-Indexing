decline, and a horizontal surface, the mesas being separated 
from one another by horizontal segments of the substrate and 

wherein: 

(i) the ratio of the height of each of the mesas to the width 
of the horizontal segments is in the range of about 1:20 

to 1:4; 
(ii) the ratio of the width of each of the mesas to the width 
of the horizontal segments is in the ratio of about 1:30 to 

1:4; and 
(iii) the angles of incline and decline of each of the mesas 
are between about 5° to 85°; and 
(c) depositing an alkali halide phosphor on the patterned surface of 
the substrate of step (b), thereby forming cracks, in the

declines of each of the mesas.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for forming a phosphor and in 
particular, it relates to a process for forming a phosphor, for converting X-ray 
radiation, on a substrate having a predetermined configuration. One of the essential components of a radiation imaging device is a 
radiation input converter. In most applications of position-sensitive radiation 
detection, conventional radiography, and digital radiography, a phosphor 
screen is used to convert the incoming radiation into visible light which is then 
detected on film, on a photodiode, or other position sensing device. Such 
phosphor screens are usually required to have high resolution and high output 
brightness characteristics. The brightness of the light output is, in part, a 
function of the thickness of the phosphor layer, which determines the amount 
or X-ray energy absorbed, and of the inherent phosphor efficiency in 
converting X-ray radiation into detectable light. However, as this layer is 
made thicker, the spatial resolution is decreased because light photons emitted 
in response to the absorption of X-ray photons or charged particles will scatter 
within the phosphor layer and emerge from the phosphor surface at points 
further away in the transverse direction. Such lateral light spreading is caused 
by two factors. First, the phosphor emits light photons isotropically from the 
point at which a radiation particle, such as the X-ray photon, is absorbed. 
Second, even light photons which are traveling more or less perpendicularly to 
the surface of the phosphor layer may be scattered in the lateral direction 
before they reach the surface. Thus, the actual thickness of the phosphor 
layer is a compromise between the desired high radiation absorption that may 
be obtained from thicker layers and the required or desired resolution which 
improves as the thickness of the layer is reduced. Clearly, it would be  
 
desirable to increase the thickness of the phosphor layer without degrading the 
spatial resolution. This can be accomplished by suppressing the lateral light 
spread within the layer. Certain techniques for forming small cracks 
perpendicular to the phosphor surface to limit light spread have been 
developed, and the characteristics of evaporated CsI(T1) layers coupled to a 
Si:H photodiode have been disclosed, for example, in copending U.S. Patent 
application Serial No. 08/090,882. The incorporation of cracks in the phosphor layer, which are 
essentially perpendicular to the surface of the phosphor layer, exhibit
