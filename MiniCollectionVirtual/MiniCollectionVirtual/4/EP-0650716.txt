<ABSTRACT>
There is described a massage device for rolling massage of skin and reflex zones of the human body, in which massage rings or rolling bodies 106 mounted so as to be freely rotatable are seated on at least one shaft seated on a handle. These massage rings or rolling bodies each carry prong-, tooth- or needle-like projections 108 which are uniformly distributed in the circumferential direction. In order to increase considerably the number of stimulation sites on the skin and reflex zones without impairing the handiness of the massage roller it is proposed   - that each massage ring or rolling body 106 be provided with a double or multiple row 110/112 of projections 108, - that the rows 110/112 of projections 108 have a predetermined or fixed lateral spacing 114 relative to one another, and - that the projections 108 in the adjacent rows 110/112 be arranged so as to be offset relative to one another with a gap 116 in the circumferential direction.

Massager for roller massage of skin and reflex zones on the human
body, in which massage rings (28; 58; 78; 106) in the form of disk

elements (120, 122) made of metal or plastic are mounted freely
rotatably on at least one axis (24; 54; 74) mounted on a handle (12;

52; 72), each of which disk elements bears in peripheral direction
preferably uniformly distributed spike-, tooth- or else needle-like

projections (28; 58; 78; 108) narrowing to their free ends and are, if
applicable, kept apart by spacer rings (26; 56; 76) likewise located

on the axle,
characterized in that
two or more disk elements (120, 122) are firmly connected with
each other to form a twin toothed wheel, whereby the projections

(28; 58; 78; 108) of adjacent disk elements (120, 122) are staggered
in peripheral direction, and that moreover the two disk elements

(120, 122) are configured as flat bevel gears and are mirror-imaged
to each other in the cross-section, whereby the outer lateral

surfaces (126) of all projections of these disk elements coincide with
an outer side of a disk element (128) and the inner lateral surfaces

(130) of these projections assume an inclined position tilted away
from the common center plane (132-132) of the two outer disk

elements (120, 122).
Roller massager according to claim 1,
characterized in that
the disk elements (120, 122) are connected with each other by
pressing, welding, riveting or bonding to form the twin or multiple

toothed wheel respectively.
Roller massager according to claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that
each of the disk elements (120, 122) has a thickness of 0.8 mm.
Roller massager according to one of claims 1 through 3,
characterized in that
the free ends of the projections (28; 58; 78; 108) have a convexly
vaulted dome (118) which is formed with a radius of approximately

0.25 mm in the direction of the disk element or rotation plane
respectively, whereas they have a radius of approximately 0.15 mm

transversely to the disk element or rotation plane respectively.
Roller massager according to one of claims 1 through 4,
characterized in that
at least the projections (108) of the massage rings (106) or of the
disk elements (120, 122) forming same respectively are equipped

with a noble metal coating, for example of silver or gold.
Roller massager according to one of claims 1 through 5,
characterized in that
one (122) of the outer disk elements (120, 122) of a twin toothed
wheel has a unilaterally projecting neck (136) enclosing its axle

through hole, 
that this neck (136) is insertable into the axle through hole (138) of
the other disk element (120),
and that the margin (140) of the neck (136) projects slightly over the
outer lateral surface (126) of the other outer disk element (120) and

is beaded against the margin (142) of the axle through hole (138) of
that disk element.
Roller massager according to claim 6,
characterized in that
the margin of the axle through hole (138) in the other disk element
(120) has a unilaterally formed chamfer (142) which forms a seat for

the marginal beading (144) at the neck (136) of the one disk
element (122).
Roller massager according to one of claims 6 through 7,
characterized in that
the beading (144) at the neck (136) of the one outer disk element
(122) is formed by pressing.
Roller massager according to one of claims 6 through 8,
characterized in that
the neck (136) of the one disk element (122) is formed by a deep-drawing
process.
Roller massager according to one of claims 6 through 9,
characterized in that
the neck (136) projects over that lateral surface of the one outer
disk element (122) at which the lateral surfaces (130) of the

projections (108) have their inclined position.
