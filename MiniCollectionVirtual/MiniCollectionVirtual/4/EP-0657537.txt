<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gene of a yeast 
belonging to the genus Candida. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a secretory aspartic 
proteinase gene of a yeast belonging to the genus Candida. Irrespective of its significant clinical meaning, any 
effective method for diagnosis closely related to 
treatment has not been established for candidiasis, one of 
the serious diseases in opportunistic infections, which 
tends to be increasing in recent years because of highly 
intensive medical treatment. A reagent for diagnosis 
currently commercially available is the one for 
determining anti-Candida mannan antibody in serum using 
mannan antigen which is one of the cell wall components of 
pathogenic Candida yeast. However, this reagent for 
diagnosis often shows a significantly high level also in 
healthy individuals (Koji Takagi, Nobuyuki Shimono, 
Toshiyuki Ishimaru, Kaoru Okada, Yoshiro Sawae: Summary of 
a 10th lecture at a medical mycology symposium, page 13). There are also methods for biochemically assaying 
metabolites of Candida or component of the Candida cells. 
However, these methods also sometimes provide a 
significantly high level even in patients who do not 
suffer pathogenically from Candidiasis. It has  
 
thus been desired to establish a method for diagnosis 
specific to Candidiasis. On the other hand, a variety of genetic diagnosise 
have been developed in recent years. Characteristics of 
pathogenic Candida yeast are determined by its gene and if 
the DNA sequence characteristic of the pathogenic Candida 
yeast is determined, it would be possible to determine its 
presence. Turning to yeasts belonging to the genus Candida, a 
strain capable of producing secretory aspartic proteinase 
is limited to a pathogenic yeast and if the DNA sequence 
of secretory aspartic proteinase characteristic of the 
pathogenic yeast is rapidly determined with high 
sensitivity, it would be possible to determine the 
presence of pathogenic Candida yeast in a simple manner. In summary, the present invention relates to a 
secretory aspartic proteinase gene of a yeast belonging to 
the genus Candida which is represented by SEQ ID No. 1 of 
Sequence Listing.  The whole sequence of nucleic acids of the secretory 
aspartic proteinase gene of pathogenic Candidaalbicans can be 
determined, for example, by the following procedures. The invention will be further explained below by taking 
pathogenic Candidaalbicans No. 114 (TIMM 2726) as a representative 
example of pathogenic Candidaalbicans.
