into a hub insertion hole (4) and pulled out thereof into inside 

a syringe body. A chamfer portion (19b) is formed at the hub body, 
being capable of engaging with the hub insertion hole. A 

needle insertion hole (21) capable of being inserted a needle (36) 
therein is provided with an end face of the hub body in a 

direction of an axis center of the hub body. A flow hole (27) is 
provided with the hub body such that the needle insertion 

hole and an inside of the syringe body are communicated with 
each other in the direction of the axis center. A piston 

engagement hole (29) is provided on end face side of the hub body, 
so as to engage with the piston (40). A seal taper (17) is annularly 

formed at the hub body, such that its outside diameter is 
made narrower for the end face side, so as to abut on and

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hub for a syringe, connecting 
structure of the hub, the syringe, a piston, a needle 
assembly unit, connecting structure between the needle assembly 
unit and the syringe, a syringe assembly and a method of 
assembling the syringe assembly, suitable for applying to a 
throwaway syringe assembly. Since patient's blood included pathogenic bacteria 
adheres to a needle of a syringe assembly used, many throwaway 
syringe assemblies have been used for preventing secondary 
infection. A conventional throwaway syringe assembly is disposed 
so as to discard after use. However, since it is necessary 
to remove a danger of secondary infection generating through 
the wound of a hand or the like by a needle attached a patient's 
blood and the like thereto when the syringe assembly 
is dealt with, the needle is cut from the syringe assembly 
with scissors or the like after use, and after that, they are 
discarded.  However, the handling operation of a conventional 
throwaway syringe assembly requires a long time since it is 
necessary to handle it with religious care so as not to hurt 
a hand or the like with the needle just after its use till 
the needle is cut. In addition, the cutting operation of a conventional 
throwaway syringe assembly to be executed before disposal is 
troublesome. Then, the throwaway syringe assembly, capable of maintaining 
safety just after use by inserting a needle into a 
syringe of the syringe assembly just after use using a screw 
or the like, and omitting cutting operation of a needle, has 
been proposed. However, the assembly and the operation of 
the proposed syringe assembly are difficult since its structure 
is complex. It is preferable to use a syringe assembly more widely 
in such a manner that according to use, a plurality of kinds 
of needles are selected for a syringe or a plurality of kinds 
of syringes are selected for a needle so as to connect just 
before injection action at a site of treatment. However, it 
is difficult to easily insert a needle and a hub for connecting 
a needle with a syringe into a syringe at a site of 
treatment in a conventional throwaway syringe assembly proposed. An object of the present invention is to provide  
 
a hub for a syringe, connecting structure of the hub, the 
syringe, a piston, a needle assembly unit, a connecting 
structure between the needle assembly unit and the syringe, a 
syringe assembly and a method of assembling the syringe 
assembly, in a throwaway syringe assembly, with which safety
