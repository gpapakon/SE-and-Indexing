<ABSTRACT>
A thermoelectric sensor element that is adapted to respond to thermal radiation is capable of manufacture into a sensor array on a single crystal semiconductor means, such as silicon. An anisotropically etched pit is provided under the sensing surface, and the pit generally corresponds to the geometry of the sensor element. The geometry is selected to be rectangular and falls along a selected orientation of the particular crystalline structure used for manufacture of the device to thereby allow for a high density of the sensor elements. The sensor elements are manufactured of two dissimilar metals in a sinuous pattern to provide the thermoelectric effect.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application is related to an integrated 
micromechanical thermoelectric sensor element as claimed in Claim 1. The production of exccedingly small sensing and control devices has been 
developed to a high state of perfection over the last 30 years. In the last 30 years, the 
manufacture of mass-produced microelectronic circuits on silicon wafers has become 
the forerunner of the production of various other devices by similar manufacturing 
techniques. The fabrication of novel three-dimensional microelectronic devices in a 
semiconductor crystal, typically silicon, has been accomplished by fabricating the 
device through many techniques including isotropic and anisotropic etching. These 
techniques utilize the crystalline structure of a single crystal semiconductor The 
techniques have evolved to the point where devices that are only a few micrometers (thousandths of 
an inch) in dimension are manufactured in quantity. The state of the art generally can be found 
in a number of published articles. 
Articles of particular interest are found in IEEE Transactions on 
Electronics Devices, Volume Ed-25, No. 10, October 1978, at pages 1178 and 1241. 
The article appearing at page 1178 is entitled "Fabrication of Novel Three-dimensional 
Microstructures by the Anisotropic Etching of (100) and (110) Silicon"  
 
by E. Bassous. The article appearing at page 1241 is entitled "Dynamic 
Micromechanics on Silicon: Techniques and Devices" by K.E. Petersen. Also of 
interest as general background is an article entitled "Silicon Micromechanical 
Devices" which was published on pages 44-45 of the April 1983 issue of Scientific 
American. The articles referenced above show clearly that it is 
old, and the technique well-known, to manufacture micromechanical devices by 
etching into a single crystal silicon. The etching techniques generally rely on 
obtaining the maximum speed of etching, and as such, the planes within the crystal 
typically dictate the orientation of the device on the surface of the structure. The 
dictation of the orientation of the manufactured device on the surface of a single 
crystal silicon provides a utilitarian way of producing certain individual devices. 
Typically, the silicon structure is separated after manufacture so that the individual 
devices can be utilized separately and the orientation of the device with respect to the 
crystalline structure usually leaves unused surfaces of the silicon crystal. Sometimes 
these unused surfaces are adapted for use as an area upon which
