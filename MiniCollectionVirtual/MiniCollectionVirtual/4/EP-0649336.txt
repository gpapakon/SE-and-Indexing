<ABSTRACT>
The specification discloses pollution control equipment for pollution generating industrial processes. A containment structure (1) confines pollutants within the structure from which they are removed by cleaning equipment. An absorption refrigeration system removes heat from the containment structure for co-generation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to control of pollution and 
emissions from industrial processes. More particularly, 
this invention relates to apparatus which generates heat 
and emissions which are trapped in a containment building 
and which are extracted from the atmosphere within the 
containment building. Certain processes are well known to produce 
substantial quantities of heat and also particulate and 
gaseous emission. Such processes are common in the metals 
industries and include equipment such as top-blown oxygen 
converters and by-product coke ovens. Coke ovens have been particularly difficult to 
operate in compliance with existing environmental 
regulations. Substantial amounts of heat are evolved in 
the operation of a coke oven. Problems of emissions and 
atmospheric pollution arise when incandescent coke is 
pushed from an oven into a quench car, when the 
incandescent coke is quenched, and when tars are burned 
off the oven door seals to permit a tight fit to be 
maintained when the oven is recharged with coking coal. 
Despite ongoing and diligent efforts to resolve pollution 
problems, pollution control continues to be a major effort 
in coke oven operation. GB-A-2220255 deals with the problem of emissions and 
atmospheric pollution in which a chamber is formed above 
the coke oven roof and maintained at a reduced pressure 
for extracting gas carrying pollutants from the oven roof. 
That specification does not, however, deal with the 
problems of pollution which arise when the incandescent 
coke is pushed from the oven into a quench car. 
GB-A-2220255 has a further drawback. A major shortcoming 
of that specification is that the coke oven emissions are 
not contained and treated but are simply withdrawn from 
the vicinity of the coke oven within the enclosure 
building and are then discharged into the atmosphere 
without further treatment.  
 I have invented new and useful improvements in 
pollution control apparatus for industrial processes and 
the like. The invention provides pollution control 
apparatus for industrial processing equipment which 
generates large quantities of heated gases carrying 
pollutants, which apparatus comprises: 
(a) a containment structure which encloses the 
processing equipment and which includes a barrier 
interposed between the processing equipment and the 
surrounding atmosphere, (b) gas cleaning apparatus having an intake and a 
discharge within the containment structure, and (c) an absorption refrigeration system having 
(i) a generator in heat exchange

interposed between the processing equipment and the 
surrounding atmosphere, 
(b) gas cleaning apparatus (22;122) having an intake 
(23;123) and a discharge (24) within the containment structure, and 
(c) an absorption refrigeration system having 

(i) a generator (30;130) in heat exchange 
relationship with hot gases within the containment structure and 

activated by the heat within those gases, 
(ii) a condenser (33) positioned in heat 
exchange relationship with a medium outside the containment structure, 

and 
(iii) an evaporator (39) positioned in 
heat exchange relationship with the atmosphere within the 

containment structure. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 in which a localized 
portion of the containment structure (1) is cooled whereby 

a circulation of gases in the containment structure is 
induced by the resulting thermal gradient.

the containment structure (1) comprises a latticework (3) 

of connected members. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, in which 
the containment structure (1) comprises a plurality of 

conduits (3) forming at least a part of the evaporator 
(39) of the refrigeration system.  

 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, in which 
the industrial processing equipment is a coke oven battery 

(2). 
Apparatus according to claim 5, in which a 
combustion system heats the coke ovens and is separated 

from the atmosphere within the containment structure (1). 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, in which 
reject heat from the refrigeration condenser (33) is used 

for co-generation. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, in which 
the refrigeration system is used in part to cool a 

selected gas flow within the containment structure (1). 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein 
the generator (130) is positioned within the containment structure and 

has a gas intake (151) and a gas 
discharge within the containment structure (1), the intake 

being above the discharge, whereby gas cooled in the 
generator is discharged toward the lower part of the 

enclosed space. 
A process for collecting pollutants produced by 
processing equipment that generates hot gases carrying 

pollutants, the processing equipment being enclosed in a 
containment structure (1) of an apparatus according to any 

preceding claim, which process comprises: 

(a) collecting the hot gases within the containment 
structure (1) which separates the hot gases from the 

atmosphere, 
(b) passing the hot gases through the gas cleaning 
apparatus (22) in flow relationship to the inside of the
