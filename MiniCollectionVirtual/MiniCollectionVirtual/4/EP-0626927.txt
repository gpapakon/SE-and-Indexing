<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to stacker
assemblies for use in document handling systems, and more
particularly to a document stacker assembly having a novel
variable pressure stacker plate.Document handling or processing systems are generally
known in which a plurality of documents, such as mailing
envelopes and the like, are conveyed in serial upstanding on-edge
relation from a feed magazine through one or more processing
stations, and ultimately to one or more stacker stations after
sorting. The stacker stations, alternatively termed stacker
assemblies, receive the sorted documents in serial fashion and
maintain them in upstanding on-edge stacked relation until
removed for subsequent handling. See, for example, U.S. patent
No. 4,955,596 which is incorporated herein by reference and which is the closest prior art.To maintain documents in upstanding stacked relation
as they are fed into a stacker station, known stacker stations
include vertically oriented stacker or pressure plates which
engage the leading document in the stacker station and move
progressively along the length of the stacker in response to
successive documents fed into the stacker station. It is a
common practice to apply a biasing force to the stacker or
pressure plate so as to urge it against the stacked documents and
maintain them in upstanding relation as the documents are fed
into the stack from an in-feed conveyor or the like. If the
stacker plate pressure is relatively light, thin documents, such
as mailing envelopes on the order of 0.018 cm (.007 inch) thick, can be 
readily introduced into the stacker. If the stacker plate
pressure is too great, the thin mailing envelopes are prevented
from readily entering the stacker and may jam at the entry into
the stacker. If the stacker plate pressure is too light, heavier
documents, such as mailing envelopes or flats up to .25 inch
thick or greater, introduced into the stack at an early stage of
stack buildup, may overcome the biasing force applied to the
stacker plate and "kick" the plate rearwardly. This can result
in the stacked documents falling to a substantially horizontal
orientation with resultant malfunction of the stacker assembly.
The present invention overcomes these problems by providing a
stacker assembly having a stacker or pressure plate operative to
support both lightweight and heavier documents fed into the
stacker assembly.One of the primary objects of the present invention is
to provide a novel stacker assembly for use in a document
processing system or the
