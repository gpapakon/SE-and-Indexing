Ignition switch circuit for an engine (12) with an 
ignition switch (40) connected to a power supply (30), 

a status switch (48), which responds on attaining a 
certain condition, and with an electrical operating 

device, which can be activated during the start-up 
process for the supply of fuel, characterised in that 

the current flow through the operating device (21) can 
be interrupted by a switch controlled by a relay (72), 

one side of the coil (70) of the relay (72) being 
connected to the ignition switch (40) and the other 

side of the coil (70) being connected to the input of 
the status switch (48). 
Ignition switch circuit according to Claim 1, the 
status switch being a pressure-activated switch (48) 

and opening on attaining a predetermined oil pressure, 
and the electrical operating device being a solenoid 

(21) with a pull-in coil, characterised in that the 
relay-controlled switch comprises a first terminal 

(82), which is connected to the pull-in coil of the 
solenoid (21), and a second terminal (86), which is 

connected to the power supply (30), and connects the 
first and second terminal (82, 86) to one another when 

the pressure switch (48) and the ignition switch 
circuit (10) are closed. 
Ignition switch circuit according to Claim 2, the 
engine being a diesel engine (12) and being provided 

with an electrically operable starter (16), 
characterised in that the second terminal (86) of the 

switch controlled by relay (72) is connected to the 
starter (16). 
Ignition switch circuit according to Claim 2, the 
engine being a diesel engine (12) and being provided  

 
with a starter (16) and with a starter engagement 

relay (36), characterised in that the second terminal 
(86) of the switch controlled by relay (72) is 

connected to the starter engagement relay (36).
