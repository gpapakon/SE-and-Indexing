<ABSTRACT>
A manifold (1) comprising a first tubular body (2) 
with fittings (3) for metering valves; a second body (4) 

housed inside the first body (2) so as to define, with 
the first body (2), a conduit (5) for supplying fuel to 

the fittings (3); a wall (6) closing a first end of the 
first body (2); and a pressure regulator (7) closing a 

second end of the first body (2) and one end of the 
second body (4). The second body (4) comprises a first 

pipe (12) extending from the central portion of the 
first body (2) to the wall (6); a fuel inlet (13) for 

the first pipe (12), defined in the central portion of 
the first body (2); a hydraulic passage (14) defined, 

close to the wall (6), between the first pipe (12) and 
the conduit (5); a second pipe (15) extending from the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a manifold for an 
internal combustion engine fuel supply device, and in 
particular to a manifold for supplying pressurized fuel 
to a number of fuel metering and atomizing valves. Manifolds of the above type normally comprise a 
first tubular body with a number of fittings for the 
valves; and a second tubular body housed coaxially 
inside the first body so as to define, between the first 
and second bodies, an annular conduit for supplying fuel 
to the fittings. The first and second bodies are closed 
at a first axial end by a pressure regulator for 
maintaining the fuel pressure in the supply conduit 
below a given value, and at a second axial end by cap in 
which are formed a first duct between the fuel tank and 
the annular supply conduit, and a second duct between 
the second tubular body and the tank. On some manifolds, 
the second duct is formed in the first tubular body, at 
the pressure regulator seat. Manifolds of the aforementioned type present  
 
several drawbacks, foremost of which is the fact that 
delivery and drainage of the fuel are defined at one 
axial end of the manifold, which, in addition to 
limiting assembly of the manifold, also results in 
greater length and in difficulties in hydraulically 
connecting the manifold and tank. Moreover, the sealing 
efficiency of the ducts formed in the cap or close to 
the pressure regulator is invariably reduced with time, 
thus resulting in fuel leakage. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a manifold for an internal combustion engine 
fuel supply device, designed to overcome the 
aforementioned drawbacks. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a manifold for an internal combustion engine 
fuel supply device, comprising a first tubular body with 
a number of fittings for fuel metering and atomizing 
valves; a second body housed inside said first body so 
as to define, with said first body, a conduit for 
supplying fuel to said fittings; a wall for closing a 
first axial end of said first body; and a pressure 
regulator mounted so as to close a second axial end of 
said first body and a first axial end of said second 
body; characterized by the fact that said second body 
comprises:
 
   a first pipe extending from a central portion of 
said first body to said wall;
 
   a fuel inlet for said first pipe, defined in said  
 
central portion of said first body;
 
   a hydraulic passage defined, close to said wall, 
between a first axial end of said first pipe and said 
conduit;
