<ABSTRACT>
Methods for toasting a puffed ready-to-eat cereal base are provided to increase the toasted flavor thereof. The methods comprise the step of subjecting the cereal base to a brief exposure to a high intensity (
>
125 V/cm) microwave field for about 5 to 45 seconds. The microwave toasted cereal pieces exhibit superior flavor resulting from "interior" toasting of the cereal base.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to food products and 
to methods for their preparation. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to puffed ready-to-eat breakfast 
cereals and to their methods of preparation. Ready-to-eat ("R-T-E") breakfast cereals are 
popular packaged food items. R-T-E cereals exist in large 
numbers of varieties including puffed and unpuffed, natural 
or presweetened, and including a wide variety of cereal 
compositions. One problem in cereal processing resides in flavor 
development. Many consumers prefer puffed cereals, and 
particularly R-T-E cereal in complex shapes such as torroids 
or rings or other shapes such as stars. The term "complex 
shapes" is used herein in reference to or equivalently with 
non-convex shapes. Such complexly shaped puffed cereals are 
generally prepared by gun puffing moist (e.g., 10% to 14% 
moisture) cereal pellets. While popular, many consumers 
enjoy the flavor of toasted cereals. Unfortunately, it is 
difficult to evenly toast puffed R-T-E cereals, especially 
those cereal pieces having a complex shape using 
conventional toasting equipment and methods. Generally,  
 
such known toasting techniques involve intense heating 
including radiant and/or conduction heating which involve 
heat transfer from the exterior of the piece inward. Due to 
the low density of puffed pieces which insulatively resists 
conductive heat transfer and due to complex shapes, 
undesirable scorching of the exterior surface can occur 
prior to the development of desirable toasted flavor by any 
significant weight of the interior of the cereal piece. The operation of the gun puffing apparatus can be 
adjusted to provide some degree of toasting to the resulting 
puffed cereal pieces. Primarily, the adjustment involves 
retaining the pellets within the cereal gun for longer 
residence times so as to increase the pellets' exposure to 
the elevated temperature and pressure conditions within the 
gun. While effective to some degree, increasing the 
residence time of the pellets within the gun necessarily 
unfortunately decreases the throughput of pellets through 
the gun. Since cereal puffing guns are complex and capital 
and energy intensive manufacturing equipment, even modest 
reductions in capacity or throughput can materially increase 
production costs. In view of the state of the art, there is a 
continuing need for improvements in the cereal processing 
art for preparing R-T-E cereals exhibiting increased 
stability. Accordingly, it is an object of the present 
invent

<CLAIMS>
A method for interiorly toasting a puffed R-T-E 
cereal base to improve its flavor and texture, 

comprising the step of:
 
   subjecting a puffed R-T-E cereal base to a high 

intensity microwave field for a sufficient period of 
time long enough to toast the interior of the cereal 

base and shorter than to cause exterior scorching to 
provide an interiorly toasted R-T-E cereal base,
 
   wherein the microwave field has a field strength of 

about 125-350 V/cm. 
A method for preparing a puffed cereal piece 
exhibiting fewer interior voids and interior toasting 

comprising the steps of: 

A. providing a quantity of cooked cereal pieces 
having a moisture content ranging from about 

8% to 20% by weight; 
B. microwave tempering the cooked cereal pieces 
in a high intensity microwave field having a 

field strength of greater than 125 V/cm for a 
time sufficient to evenly distribute the 

moisture without steam pressure generation 
within the piece to form a microwave tempered 

cereal pellet; 
C. puffing the microwave tempered cereal pellets 
to form puffed cereal pieces; and 
D. interiorly microwave toasting the puffed 

cereal pieces by subjecting the puffed cereal 
pieces to a high intensity microwave field 

having a field strength of greater than 125 
V/cm for a time sufficiently long to 

interiorly toast, but shorter than to cause 
exterior scorching to form finished interiorly 

toasted cereal pieces. 
The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein the R-T-E cereal 
base has a moisture content of about 2% to 10% by 

weight. 
The method of claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein the microwave 
heating step is continued for about 5 to 45 seconds. 
The method of any preceding claim wherein the 
cereal base has a bulk density ranging from about 5.0 to 

11 oz/124 in
3
 (0.07 to 0.15g/cc). 
The method of any preceding claim wherein the 
puffed cereal base has a convex shape. 
The method of any preceding claim wherein the 
cereal base comprises a corn based cereal base. 
The method of claim 7 wherein the cereal base 
comprises: 


a) about 40 to 90 wt % of the cereal base of corn 
flour, 
b) about 0.1 to 40 wt % of supplemental flour, 
c) about 0.1 to 20 wt % of wheat starch. 
The method of any preceding claim wherein the 
puffed cereal pieces comprise spherical pieces. 
The method of any of claims 1 to 6 wherein the 
cereal base comprises a puffed grain selected from the 

group consisting of puffed corn, puffed wheat, puffed 
rice and mixtures thereof. 
The method of claim 10 wherein the cereal 
comprises: 


a) about 75 to 85 wt % of the cereal base of corn 
flour; 
b) about 0.5 to 15 wt % of supplemental flour,  
 
c) about 2.5 to 75 wt % of wheat starch, 
d) about 1 to 2.5 wt % of salt, and 
e) about 0.3 to 7 wt % of sugar. 
The method of any of claims 1 to 5 wherein the 
puffed cereal base has a non-convex shape. 
The method of claim 12 wherein the puffed cereal 
base shape is selected from the group consisting of 

rings, stars, letters, figurines, cornucopias, and 
mixtures thereof. 
The method of claim 13 wherein the cereal base 
comprises puffed ring-shaped cereal pieces.

comprising applying a topical coating to the cereal 

base. 
The method of claim 16 wherein the topical coating 
step follows the microwave step, and wherein the coating 

additionally comprises a sweetener. 
The method of claim 16 wherein the topical coating 
step precedes the microwave step. 
The method of any preceding claim additionally
