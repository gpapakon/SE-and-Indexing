<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus is provided for producing 
single width barcodes in a continuous, serpentine 

pattern. This pattern provides continuity of operation 
for laser marking instruments and thereby results in 

the formation of more uniform and higher quality 
barcode indicia. The use of a continuous serpentine 

pattern also increases the speed at which the code may 
be written onto a substrate. This marking method is 

particularly appropriate for use in marking a wide 

variety of materials including semiconductors, metals, 
plastics and ceramics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to marking 
substrates with barcode indicia which are readily capable of 
being read by machine with a very low error rate especially 
when compared to optical character recognition systems. More 
particularly, the present invention is directed to a method 
for marking barcodes in a continuous fashion as a means for 
providing uniformity in line width and use on a variety of 
substrate materials. Even more particularly, the present 
invention is directed to the writing of singlewidth barcodes 
on various materials using laser radiation so as to produce 
serpentine or boustrophedonic patterns which enhance both 
writing andreading barcode characteristics. The present invention has grown out of work in the marking of 
semiconductor wafers with a single width barcode which is 
suitable for the materials and the processes involved in wafer 
processing and manufacture to produce electronic circuit chip 
devices. In particular, it has been found that writing 
multiple width barcode indicia on semiconductor materials 
using a laser is very difficult. Multiple width barcodes 
possesss solid lines which are both wide and narrow, and 
because of the nature of the semiconductor material, lines 
which are disposed adjacent to one another to produce or 
effectuate multiple width bar code patterns tend to be very 
difficult to read and correspondingly also very difficult to 
write in a fashion which renders them sufficiently well 
adapted to be read. Accordingly, especially when writing on semiconductor 
materials and especially when employing laser energy to 
produce the markings, both of which are very desirable, it has 
been found that it is necessary to use single width barcodes  
 
as opposed to multiple width barcodes which is perhaps best 
exemplified by the UPC (Universal Product Code) barcode 
system. Additionally, in order to process as many wafers or other 
forms of substrates through a marking system as quickly as 
possible, it is desirable to be able to operate in a 
continuous mode. However, certain materials require higher 
laser powers or longer laser exposure times to initiate the 
writing process but which nonetheless can sustain the writing 
process at a lower power or shorter exposure. For example, 
various colors of plastics have substantially different 
requirements for starting laser power depending upon the 
material's reflectivity. However, once marking starts at a 
given position the reflectivity decreases and/or the 
absorption increases so that
