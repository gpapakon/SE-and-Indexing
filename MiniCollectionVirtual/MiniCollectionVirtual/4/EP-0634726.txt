<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an IDCT apparatus for 
performing an IDCT operation on an input signal having a 

plurality of macroblocks of transformed coefficients and time 
gaps of variable duration, each of the time gaps being 

inserted between two successive macroblocks. The IDCT 
apparatus comprises an IDCT controller for generating a 

plurality of control signals, two IDCT processors for 
alternately converting the macroblocks of coefficients in the 

data signal into macroblocks of inverse transformed 
coefficients in response to the control signals. The outputs 

from the two IDCT processors are combined to the final inverse 
transformed output data signal from the IDCT apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an inverse discrete
cosine transform(IDCT) apparatus for use in a digital image
processing system; and, more particularly, to an IDCT
apparatus capable of processing a transformed video signal
consisting of sets of video data and various time gaps
intervening therebetween.As is well known, transmission of digitized video signals
can deliver video images of much higher quality than the
transmission of analog signals. When an image signal
comprising a sequence of image "frames" is expressed in a
digital form, a substantial amount of data is generated for
transmission, especially in the case of a high definition
television system. Since, however, the available frequency
bandwidth of a conventional transmission channel is limited,
in order to transmit the substantial amounts of digital data
through the limited channel bandwidth, it is inevitable to
compress or reduce the volume of the transmission data. The image signal can be normally compressed without
seriously affecting its integrity because there usually exist
certain correlationships or redundancies among some of the
pixels in a single frame and also among those of neighboring
frames. Accordingly, most of prior art image signal encoding
methods employ various compression techniques (or coding
methods) built on the idea of utilizing or truncating the
redundancies.One category of such coding methods relates to transform
techniques which take advantage of the redundancies existing
in a single frame. One of such transform methods is a two-dimensional
Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT), which is described
in Chen and Pratt, "Scene Adaptive Coder", IEEE Transactions
on Communication, COM-32, No. 3(March 1984).In such schemes as ISO/IEC MPEG standards, the DCT is
employed with other coding methods such as Differential Pulse-Code
Modulation(DPCM) and motion compensated predictive coding
which employs a motion estimation and prediction(see MPEG
Video Simulation Model Three, International Organization for
Standardization, Coded Representation of Picture and Audio
Information, 1990, ISO-IEC/JTC1/SC2/WG8 MPEG 90/041).In an image encoding/decoding system employing the DCT,
a commercially available DCT/IDCT processor is often used in
performing the DCT/IDCT operation. The present invention is
primarily concerned with an apparatus which performs an IDCT
operation in an image decoding system using commercially 
available IDCT processors.In a conventional image encoding system, each frame of
image signal is first divided into blocks, each
