<ABSTRACT>
Match head formulations suitable for the production of safety matches and 
matches that may be struck anywhere are described in which chromium 

compounds, sesqui-based phosphorus compounds, sulphur compounds and 
oxides of zinc are absent. In their place 

is described the use of either amorphous 
phosphorus or, in the case of match hea
d formulations suitable for the 
production of safety matches, an iron phosphide known as ferrophosphorus. 

These formulations are environmentally 
friendly both in manufacture and use. 
Environmentally friendly match head formulations which may be brightly 
coloured are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to match head formulations
suitable for the production of matches that may be struck
anywhere and to matches when coated with the said
formulations.For many years match head formulations have contained
chromium compounds, phosphorus sesquisulphide, sulphur
and/or sulphur compounds and zinc oxide. These compounds
are now widely recognised as having undesirable
environmental properties both in relation to the
manufacture of such formulations and in relation to their
use and it is therefore an object of the present invention
to provide a match head formulation in which these
compounds are substantially absent.One type of match in common use has a match head
formulation which is ignited by an abrasive contact with
any suitable roughened surface. These are referred to as
'strike anywhere' matches. A second type of match in common
use has a match head formulation which is ignited by an
abrasive contact with a surface containing a formulation
for initiating ignition of the match head. These are
referred to as 'safety matches'.According to the present invention there
is provided a strike anywhere match head formulation
suitable for the production of strike anywhere matches
containing potassium chlorate and red amorphous phosphorus,
the balance comprising a binder, a thickener, a filler, and
a foaming agent to the exclusion of phosphorus sesquisulphide
and sulphur, said formulation being dispersed in
water, before drying, characterised in that the amount of 
amorphous red phosphorus is approximately 5.52% by dry
weight and when in the form of the wet composition the
formulation has a density of approximately 1.25 g/cm3.Preferably the proportion of potassium chlorate present is
in the range from 40 to 60 percent dry weight. Gelatine
may provide a suitable binder if present in proportions
ranging from 8 to 18 percent dry weight or alternatively
the binder may be in the form of animal glue. The thickener
is preferably a starch present in proportions of up to 4
percent dry weight while feldspar or other siliceous
minerals may be chosen as the filler. The formulation may
also include an ash improver, a pigment and a bleaching
agent.An example of the present invention will now be described
with reference to formulations suitable for the production
strike anywhere matches.In the past match head formulations suitable for the
production of strike anywhere matches have contained
phosphorus sesquisulphide compounds as the active
ingredient. In the first example phosphorus sesquisulphide
is no
