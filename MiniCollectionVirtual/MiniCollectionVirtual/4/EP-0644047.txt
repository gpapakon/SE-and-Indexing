<ABSTRACT>
Lithographic printing plates suitable for imaging by 
means of laser devices. Laser output ablates one or more plate 

layers, resulting in an imagewise pattern of features on the 
plate. The image features exhibit an affinity for ink or an 

ink-abhesive fluid that differs from that of unexposed areas. 
The plates also include a secondary ablation layer (104) that ablates 

only partially, and in a controlled fashion, as a result of 
destruction of overlying layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to digital printing
apparatus and methods, and more particularly to lithographic
printing plate constructions that may be imaged on- or off-press
using digitally controlled laser output.Traditional techniques of introducing a printed image
onto a recording material include letterpress printing, gravure
printing and offset lithography. All of these printing methods
require a plate, usually loaded onto a plate cylinder of a
rotary press for efficiency, to transfer ink in the pattern of
the image. In letterpress printing, the image pattern is
represented on the plate in the form of raised areas that
accept ink and transfer it onto the recording medium by
impression. Gravure printing cylinders, in contrast, contain
series of wells or indentations that accept ink for deposit
onto the recording medium; excess ink must be removed from the
cylinder by a doctor blade or similar device prior to contact
between the cylinder and the recording medium. In the case of offset lithography, the image is present
on a plate or mat as a pattern of ink-accepting (oleophilic)
and ink-repellent (oleophobic) surface areas. In a dry
printing system, the plate is simply inked and the image
transferred onto a recording material; the plate first makes
contact with a compliant intermediate surface called a blanket
cylinder which, in turn, applies the image to the paper or
other recording medium. In typical sheet-fed press systems,
the recording medium is pinned to an impression cylinder, which
brings it into contact with the blanket cylinder.In a wet lithographic system, the non-image areas are
hydrophilic, and the necessary ink-repellency is provided by an
initial application of a dampening (or "fountain") solution to
the plate prior to inking. The ink-repellent fountain solution
prevents ink from adhering to the non-image areas, but does not
affect the oleophilic character of the image areas.If a press is to print in more than one color, a separate
printing plate corresponding to each color is required, each
such plate usually being made photographically as described
below. In addition to preparing the appropriate plates for the
different colors, the operator must mount the plates properly
on the plate cylinders of the press, and coordinate the
positions of the cylinders so that the color components printed
by the different cylinders will be in register on the printed
copies. Each set of cylinders associated with a particular
color on a press is usually referred to as a printing station.In most
