<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to antiparasitic agents and
in particular to compounds for use with domestic
companion animals. The compounds are related to the
avermectins but have modified substituent groups at the
C-23 and C-25 positions. Processes for preparation of
the compounds and compositions thereof are also
included.The avermectins and milbemycins form an important
group of broad spectrum antiparasitic agents possessing
anthelmintic, ectoparasiticidal, insecticidal and
antibacterial activity, with application in the areas
of animal and human health, agriculture and
horticulture. The avermectins are a group of macrolide
compounds (previously referred to as C-076 compounds)
isolated from the fermentation broth of an avermectin
producing strain of Streptomyces avermitilis. In
addition to these fermentation derived products, a
large number of publications describe compounds derived
semisynthetically from these products, many of which
possess useful antiparasitic activities. Some of this
chemistry is reviewed in Macrolide Antibiotics, Omura
S., Ed., Academic press, New York (1984) and by Davies,
H.G., Green, R.H. in Natural Product Reports, (1986),
3, 87-121 and in Chem. Soc. Rev., (1991), 20, 211-269
and 271-239. Thus for example U.S. patent no 4200581
discloses avermectin derivatives substituted by
hydrocarbon groups.In our European Patent Application nos. 0214731
and 0317148, we describe the preparation of compounds
related to the avermectins but having an unnatural
substituent group at the C-25 position in place of the
isopropyl or sec-butyl group which is present in the 
naturally occurring avermectins.The present invention provides a series of semi-synthetically
derived novel compounds wherein both the
C-23 and C-25 position substituents are modified.
These compounds form the starting point for a further
series of semi-synthetically derived analogues wherein
the C-5 and C-13 position substituents may also be
modified. The compounds possess a broad spectrum of
activity against insect pests, acari, free-living
nematodes and parasites affecting animals. Moreover
the compounds of the invention possess a number of
beneficial properties compared to similar compounds in
terms of their efficacy, pharmacokinetics and
toleration. The benefits that arise from this
unexpected combination of properties include efficacy
against the important parasitic worms or arthropods
afflicting livestock, domesticated animals or humans at
lower doses than are currently employed for related
compounds and, in addition, the
