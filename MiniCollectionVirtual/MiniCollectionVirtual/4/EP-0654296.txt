<ABSTRACT>
A desulfurizing and denitrating apparatus 
wherein an inner space of a tower body (31), which has an 

introduction port (34) for a gas to be processed and a 
processed gas discharge port (35) formed respectively in 

opposite side walls (32, 33), is partitioned in a direction 
from the side wall (32) having the processed gas 

introduction port toward the side wall having the 
processed gas discharge port by an inlet louver (37), a 

perforated plate (381) and an outlet louver (39) all 
extending vertically parallel to each other, a constant-rate 

discharging device for setting a moving speed of a 
carbon-base adsorbent in a small chamber (421) defined 

between the inlet louver (37) and the perforated plate 
(381) and a constant-rate discharging device for setting 

a moving speed of a carbon-base adsorbent in a large 
chamber (431) defined between the perforated plate (381) 

and the outlet louver (39) are provided, the moving speed 
of the carbon-base adsorbent in the small chamber (421) 

is set to be 2 to 4 times greater than an average moving 
speed, and the distance from the inlet louver (37) to the 

perforated plate (381) is set to be 0.1 to 0.2 time the 
distance from the inlet louver (37) to the outlet louver 

(39). The carbon-base adsorbent can be prevented from 
being loaded with dust in the vicinity of the inlet 

louver (37), the SOâ‚‚ content can be sufficiently lowered 
in the small chamber (421), and hence the denitration 

rate in the large chamber (431) can be increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a desulfurizing
and denitrating apparatus.In a prior art desulfurizing and denitrating
tower, a catalyst is contained in a moving bed, which has
two louvers parallel to each other, so as to move in the
moving bed from above toward below. A gas to be
processed is supplied to the moving bed from one louver
and is discharged through the other louver.Fig. 2 is a sectional view of main parts of the
prior art desulfurizing and denitrating tower.As shown in Fig. 2, a moving bed 10 containing
a catalyst 9 is formed by an inlet louver 11 and an
outlet louver 12 disposed parallel to each other to
surround the moving bed 10 from both sides. Two front
and rear lower walls 13, 14 are extended downwardly
obliquely from respective lower ends of the inlet louver
11 and the outlet louver 12. The spacing between the
lower walls 13, 14 is gradually narrowed toward below,
and a discharge port 16 for the catalyst 9 is formed at
lower ends of the lower walls 13, 14.A discharge roller 18 is provided in such a
manner as to be partly located in the discharge port 16. 
The catalyst 9 supplied to an upper end of the moving bed
10 is moved gradually downwardly in the moving bed 10
upon rotation of the discharge roller 18 so that the
catalyst is discharged through the discharge port 16 at a
constant rate. A deflecting cone 20 having an inverted-V
shape in cross-section is disposed in a lower region of
the moving bed 10 in opposite relation to the discharge
port 16 for smoothing the downward movement of the
catalyst 9.On the other hand, a gas to be processed is
supplied to the moving bed 10 through the inlet louver 11
and is desulfurized and denitrated while moving transversely,
followed by being discharged through the outlet
louver 12.Fig. 3 is a schematic view of the prior art
desulfurizing and denitrating tower.In Fig. 3, a processed gas introduction port 34
and a processed gas discharge port 35 are formed respectively
in opposite side walls 32, 33 of a tower body 31.
An inner space of the tower body 31 is partitioned by the
inlet louver 11 and the outlet louver 12 disposed
parallel to each other with the moving bed 10 defined
between the inlet louver 11 and the outlet louver 12.In this tower, a gas to be processed enters the
moving bed 10 from the processed gas introduction port 34
through the inlet louver 11. The processed gas is
sufficiently contacted with the catalyst 9 (Fig. 2) in
the moving bed 10, and then reaches the processed gas 
discharge port 35 after passing the outlet louver 12.On

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for desulfurizing and denitrating gas to be
processed in a single tower, comprising


a tower body (31) having a first side wall (32) provided
with an introduction port (34) for a gas to be processed and

a second side wall (33) provided with a processed gas
discharge port (35) and disposed in opposite relation to said

first side wall (32);
an inlet louver (37) provided in said tower body (31) to
face said first side wall (32);

an outlet louver (39) disposed between said perforated
plate (381) and said second side wall (33) in said tower body

(31) parallel to said perforated plate (381) so as to define
a large chamber (431) between said perforated plate (381) and

said outlet louver (39) in which a carbon-base adsorbent is
contained, wherein the distance (L1) from said inlet louver
