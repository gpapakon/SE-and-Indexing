<ABSTRACT>
The invention is based on a method for making rubber mixtures, in which in a first stage a basic mixture is prepared in an internal mixer (3) and, without intermediate storage, in a second stage is fed for final mixing to an internal mixer (5) without a floating weight. In order that particularly viscous mixtures and quickly crosslinking mixtures can be produced, the basic mixture coming from the internal mixer is formed into a strand, cooled and then fed while still in the warm state to the internal mixer without a floating weight.

Method of producing rubber mixtures, wherein, in a 
first stage, a master batch is chargewisely produced in a 

ram-type masticator from rubber and non-reactive additional 
substances, and the master batch is also ready-mixed 

chargewisely at a reduced temperature without being 
interposed in a second stage by adding reactive additional 

substances, characterised in that, after leaving the master 
batch mixer, the master batch is shaped to form an extruded 

body, which has a gently rectangular cross-section, in that 
said master batch is cooled with water to approximately 50 

- 100째 C in such a manner that the heat contained in the 
mixture is sufficient to dry the material to be mixed as 

it travels to the ramless masticator, and in that the 
extruded body is supplied to the ramless masticator in its 

still warm state with a temperature of approximately 50 - 
100째 0. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the extruded body is cooled to approximately 70 - 90째 C. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the extruded body is supplied to the ramless masticator 

with a temperature of approximately 70 - 90째 C. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the shaping to form an extruded body is effected by one or 

more rolling mills, extruders or the like, which are 
situated directly beneath the ram-type masticator and are 

loaded directly from the ram-type masticator.
