<ABSTRACT>
Techniques for achieving high resolution, high-speed gray scale 
printing with binary spatial light modulators. A spatial light 

modulator array is divided into subarrays, and the subarrays are 
illuminated at various levels (510, 512, 514, 516) of a modulated 

light source. Additionally, each pixel (520) can be divided up into 
four phases and printed in phase pairs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to printers, more particularly to
printers using spatial light modulators (SLMs).An array of individual elements typically comprises a spatial
light modulator. Examples of these arrays are Liquid Crystal Devices
(LCDs), and Digital Micromirror Devices (DMDs). Some SLMs are
binary, that is, their cells are either ON or OFF, others may have a
set number of levels. In printing systems that produce gray scales,
this causes some problems.Xerographic printing systems typically use the following
process. The print engine receives the data from the source image,
such as a computer terminal, or a scanning unit that has scanned an
image for reproduction. The printing system converts it to light
information, and impinges the light in the correct patterns on a
photosensitive drum, causing latent charge patterns on the drum. The
drum then rotates past a toner dispenser and attracts toner
particles to the latent image on the drum's surface. The drum
rotates with these toner particles and transfers them onto
substrate, typically a piece of paper. The toner is then fused to
the paper, usually with heat, and the paper exits the print engine.Currently, most of such systems use scanned laser exposure
systems for high quality printing. Spatial light modulators are
preferred because they potentially offer more functionality for
printing. Laser scanning systems print pixel-by-pixel by scanning
the laser beam along raster lines. For example, if the user wants to
print an 8.5" by 11" (one inch corresponding to 2.54 cm) paper with
600 dots per inch (dpi) at 40 pages
per minute, each page requires 11" x 600 dpi, or 6600 lines. At 40
pages per minute this equals 4400 lines per second, where each line
has 8.5 x 600, or 5100 pixels. This requires 22.44 x 106 pixels per
second, allowing 44.6 nanoseconds per pixel. Lasers cannot modulate
fast enough in an analog fashion to give gray-scale exposure during
the short pixel time. Since SLMs have many light modulating elements
that can operate simultaneously, they can be configured to print an
entire line of print information at a time. The number of pixels
printed per second remains the same, but the SLM approach provides a 
time that is 5100 times longer (5100 x 44.6 nanoseconds = 227.5
microseconds) to print individual pixels with gray scale modulation.However, SLMs have their own problems. Because of the nature of
their ON/OFF or set number of levels operating mode, production of
gray-scale, or shades of gray in between full ON (black) and OFF (no
toner) images,
