<ABSTRACT>
A method for operating a thermal ink jet printer having 
a printhead (19) with ink firing heater resistors (17) 

responsive to pulses provided to interconnecting pads for the 
heater resistors by a printhead driver (13) which receives a 

supply voltage from a power supply (15). The method includes 
the steps of measuring a pad to pad resistance of the printhead 

that is representative of the interconnect pad to 
interconnect pad resistance of each of the ink firing resistors, 

detecting a target operating energy and a target pulse 
width for the printhead, computing a target power from the 

target operating energy and the target pulse width, calculating 
from the pad to pad resistance and the target power a 

target power supply voltage that will cause the printhead 
driver to provide the target power with the target pulse width 

to the interconnect pads for the heater resistors, setting the 
power supply to provide a voltage that is approximately equal 

to the target power supply voltage, measuring the actual 
voltage provided by the power supply, determining an actual 

operating power from the measured actual power supply voltage 
and the measured pad to pad resistance, and selecting an 

operating pulse width based on the actual operating power and 
the target energy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to the following
pending and commonly owned European patent application
EP-A-0650838:
THERMAL TURN ON ENERGY TEST FOR AN INKJET PRINTER, inventor
John Wade, et al., filed on the same date as this
application, attorney docket number M-7467.The subject invention relates generally to thermal ink
jet printers, and is directed more particularly to a
technique for determining and setting the operating energy
of a thermal ink jet printhead while the printhead is
installed in a printer.An ink jet printer forms a printed image by printing
a pattern of individual dots at particular locations of an
array defined for the printing medium. The locations are
conveniently visualized as being small dots in a rectilinear
array. The locations are sometimes called "dot
locations", "dot positions", or "pixels". Thus, the 
printing operation can be viewed as the filling of a
pattern of dot locations with dots of ink.Ink jet printers print dots by ejecting very small
drops of ink onto the print medium, and typically include
a movable carriage that supports one or more printheads
each having ink ejecting nozzles. The carriage traverses
over the surface of the print medium, and the nozzles are
controlled to eject drops of ink at appropriate times
pursuant to command of a microcomputer or other controller,
wherein the timing of the application of the ink drops is
intended to correspond to the pattern of pixels of the
image being printed.The printheads of thermal ink jet printers are
commonly implemented as replaceable printhead cartridges
which typically include one or more ink reservoirs and an
integrated circuit printhead that includes a nozzle plate
having an array of ink ejecting nozzles, a plurality of ink
firing chambers adjacent respective nozzles, and a
plurality of heater resistors adjacent the firing chambers
opposite the ink ejecting nozzles and spaced therefrom by
the firing chambers. Each heater resistor causes an ink
drop to be fired from its associated nozzle in response to
an electrical pulse of sufficient energy.Color inkjet printers commonly employ a plurality of
print cartridges, usually either two or four, mounted in
the printer carriage to produce a full spectrum of colors.
In a printer with four cartridges, each print cartridge
contains a different color ink, with the commonly used base
colors being cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. In a
printer with two cartridges, one cartridge usually contains
black ink with the other cartridge being a tri-compartment
cartridge containing
