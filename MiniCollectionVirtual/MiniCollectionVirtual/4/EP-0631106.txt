<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a 
method for measuring thickness of a thin semiconductor 
multi-layer film and, more particularly, to an improvement 
in an evaluation apparatus for non-destructively measuring 
thickness of respective layers of a thin multi-layer film 
that is grown by epitaxial growth of semiconductor crystal 
without direct contact. Recently, a thin film technique forming quite a thin 
film has been advancing. For example, in semiconductor 
devices, those having various fine pattern structures of 
submicron level are developed such as semiconductor lasers, 
GaAs HEMT(high electron mobility transistor)s, and HBT 
(heterojunction bipolar transistor)s. To produce such 
semiconductor devices with high reproducibility, 
particularly in compound semiconductor devices, it is an 
important control factor to perform film thickness control 
of a thin multi-layer film during epitaxial crystal growth. Conventionally, as a method for measuring film 
thickness to control the film thickness of such a thin film, 
a method of observing a cleaved cross-section of a sample by  
 
SEM (scanning electron microscope) or the like is generally 
employed. However, since this method is a destructive 
measurement method that requires etching a sample and, 
therefore, the sample subjected to the measurement cannot be 
run on the manufacture line, resulting in significant 
restrictions to the samples. In these circumstances, a 
method of measuring film thickness non-destructively 
employing a film interference method is recently noticed. The method of measuring film thickness utilizing this 
film interference method performs film thickness measurement 
employing a Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy 
(hereinafter referred to as FTIR) apparatus having a Fourier 
transformation processing function and a dispersion type 
spectroscopy apparatus. This method comprises irradiating a 
sample with infrared light of a relatively wide wavenumber 
range from far infrared band to near infrared band having a 
spectrum wavenumber modulation band at 0 to 32000 cm⁻¹ and, 
Fourier transforming the interference spectrum from the 
multi-layer film of the sample by the FTIR apparatus or the 
like to obtain a space interference waveform (hereinafter 
referred to as Spatialgram), thereby evaluating the film 
thickness of the multi-layer film. Figure 4 is a block diagram illustrating the whole 
construction of the FTIR apparatus. In figure 4(a),  
 
reference numeral 13 designates a Michelson interferometer
