<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an insulating material consisting of a 
mixture of pearlite and/or vermiculite granules, mica and an ash-containing 

material. An amount of 0.5 - 5.0 kgs of mica and 1.5 - 6.5 kgs of 
ash-containing material is admixed to an amount of 95 - 100 l of pearlite 

and/or vermiculite granules. The mixture is bound with 1 - 8 kgs of a 
binding agent. The invention furthermore relates to a method of producing 

an insulated duct, which is built up of two shells and an insulating 
material provided between the shells. The one shell is placed within the 

other shell and the space between the shells is filled with an insulating 
material, after which the binding agent is allowed to cure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an insulating material. Insulating materials have been used for various purposes for quite 
some time. Many of the known insulating materials, such as for example 
asbestos or glass wool, have a fibre-like structure, which may involve a 
health hazard for those who come into contact with the insulating 
materials. Furthermore insulating materials are known, which are pressed into 
plates configured to conform to the shape of the objects to be insulated, 
whereby usually vermiculite, a mica-like mineral, is used. Pressed 
insulating plates of this type are for example used in flue ducts for the 
discharge of flue gases, which flue ducts are built up of two shells 
surrounding one another, between which the plates pressed from vermiculite 
are provided. The production and provision of such pressed plates is a 
costly and time-consuming process, whilst an accurate configuration of the 
insulating plates, in particular for bends, is difficult to realise, so 
that there is a risk of heat loss at those places. Furthermore it has 
become apparent, in particular with flue ducts of this type, that the 
temperature of the outer wall may become rather high in extreme cases. The object of the invention is to provide an insulating material, 
which, when used, will obviate the above-mentioned drawbacks. According to the invention this may be achieved by means of an 
insulating material consisting of a mixture of pearlite and/or vermiculite 
granules, mica and an ash-containing material, whereby 0.5 - 5.0 kgs of 
mica and 1.5 - 6.5 kgs of ash-containing material are admixed to an amount 
of 95 - 100 l of pearlite and/or vermiculite granules, whilst the mixture  
 
is bound with 1 - 8 kgs of a binding agent. It has become apparent that the insulating properties of an 
insulating material of this type are surprisingly good, so that when an 
insulating layer of a specified thickness is made from this insulating 
material, better insulating properties are obtained than when the above-mentioned 
common insulating materials are used. In addition to this said 
insulating material is easy to handle, since it can be poured into any 
desired space to fill up such a space before curing of the binding agent 
takes place. This makes it possible for example to produce an insulated duct 
consisting of two shells surrounding each other, by pouring the aforesaid 
insulating material into the space present between the shells, after which 
the binding agent is allowed to cure. Particularly when one or both
