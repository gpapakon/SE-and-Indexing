<ABSTRACT>
A novel sugar-containing nicotine derivative represented by general formula (1), wherein R represents a ribofuranosyl 
group; and X represents an oxygen atom or two hydrogen atoms. This compound is an excellent smoking taste modifier and has 

the effects of restoring the odor and taste of tobacco lost in the production of shredded tobacco and imparting a fine pattern of 
spreading to the smoke. Because the compound (1) has a characteristic structure containing ribofuranose in its molecule and also 

containing a physiologically active nicotine as the aglycon, it is expected to be used as a medicine with a reduced toxicity besides 
the smoking taste modifier. The invention also provides another novel nicotine derivative represented by general formula (2) 

wherein X is as defined above.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel and 
optically active nicotine derivative, more particularly 
to an optically active nicotine derivative containing a 
glycosyl, represented by the following formula (1): 
wherein R is a ribofuranosyl group, and X is an oxygen 
atom or two hydrogen atoms. Further, the present invention relates to a novel 
nicotine derivative represented by the following 
formula (2): 
wherein X is the same as defined above. Nicotine is an alkaloid obtained as a by-product 
in the tobacco industry. A useful derivative of 
nicotine is also known to have an effect of improving 
the flavor and taste of tobacco (for example, Jpn. Pat. 
Nos. 1371806 and 1456909).  Well-known physiological activities of nicotine 
include an autonomic nervous regulatory activity, a 
circulatory-system regulatory activity such as 
vassopressor activity, and a digestive organ regulatory 
activity such as gastrointestinal activation (for 
example, Seikagaku, 57, 447 (1985), J. Pharm. Experi, 
Ther., 222, 463 (1983), Br. J. Pharmac., 79, 869 
(1983)). Further, alkoxy nicotine is known to have an 
antimicrobial activity and an antibacterial activity 
(U.S. Patent Serial No. 3,644,176). As mentioned above, 
nicotine and a nicotine derivative have a variety of 
physiological activities, and they are expected to be 
useful as a pharmaceutical agent. In addition, a 
sulfate of nicotine is used as an agricultural 
insecticide, and its application to the agricultural 
field is also expected. However, since nicotine has toxicity by itself and 
its volatility is high, application of nicotine to the 
above-mentioned individual fields or practical use of 
nicotine in those field has not yet been achieved. 
Accordingly, there is a request for a nicotine derivative 
having useful properties and capable of solving a 
problem such as toxicity. The present invention has been made under the 
above-mentioned circumstances and has an object to 
provide an optically active novel nicotine derivative 
containing a glycosyl and a novel nicotine derivative 
which are useful as an agent for improving the flavor 
and taste of tobacco, and which can be expected to be 
used as a physiologically active substance as mentioned 
above. It is a first object of the present invention to 
provide a novel and optically active nicotine derivative 
containing a glycosyl group. It is a second object of the present invention to 
provide a novel nicotine derivative.  In short, the present invention relates to a novel 
nicotine derivative containing
