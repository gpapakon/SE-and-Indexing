<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system for receiving a digital signal with a plurality of phases employing a time-based equaliser controlled by an estimator supplying it with correction parameters. This system includes:   - at least one peripheral servocontrol, from which the estimator, for its operation, uses at least one of these correction parameters, the peripheral servocontrol having a range of operation which is not connected with that of the time-based equaliser; - means for time-based discrimination detecting the dead areas of the estimator of each peripheral servocontrol in order to allow operation of the time-based equaliser, in such a way as to remove the interaction between the time-based equaliser and the periperhal servocontrol.   The peripheral servocontrol may consist particularly of a pointing estimator of Mueller and MÃ¼ller type, and/or of a carrier recovery device of the Leclert and Vandamme type.
