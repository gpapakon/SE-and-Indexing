<ABSTRACT>
Boring apparatus for forming a generally horizontal underground passage (10) in soil for a utility conduit or the like that includes a tool head (24) with a base portion (26) and a nose portion (28) mounted on the base portion. The nose portion (28) is rotatable relative to the base portion between a first position in which nose portion surfaces are symmetrical with respect to the tool axis (54) so that the tool (20) will move along a straight path and a second position in which nose portion surfaces are in asymmetrical position with respect to the tool axis so that said tool will move along a curved path. By application of torque to the base portion, the base portion is shifted relative to the nose portion to shift the tool head from between an asymmetrical configuration and a symmetrical configuration.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus
for boring underground horizontal passageways.Horizontally bored underground passageways for
pipelines and utilities such as electrical distribution
lines provide a safe, economical and environmentally
responsible alternative to digging through or building
over natural terrain and man-made obstacles.A wide variety of drilling methods and apparatus
for boring underground passageways for installation of
utility cables, pipes and the like are known. Those
known techniques include the use of a pneumatic impact
piercing tool (sometimes termed a "mole") to punch a hole
through soil (not rock) without the need to excavate an
open trench in which to lay the pipe or cable. The
accuracy of such moles is poor for all but short straight
line distances. Unguided moles are easily deflected off
course by common anomalies, such as rocks, found in the
soil. A trackable transmitter, or sonde, may be mounted
on the mole to provide information on its course. A
particular impact mole system includes an impact mole
mounted on the end of a rigid drill pipe which is used to
feed air to the impact mole. Housed within the mole is a
shock resistant sonde which delivers location, depth and
roll angle information to an operator on the surface.
The front end of that mole has a forwardly facing slant
face which tends to cause the tool to deflect from a
straight path as it advances forward. The rigid drill
pipe is used to rotate the entire drill string and the
mole as it is thrust forward, and as long as rotation is
maintained, the deflecting action of the slant face is
"averaged out" and the tool advances in a nominally
straight (slightly spiral) path unless deflected off
course by an obstacle. When it is desired to direct the 
mole in a desired direction, the rigid drill pipe is
rotated to bring the slant face to the desired roll
orientation, utilizing data from the sonde. The tool
is then thrust forward without rotation such that the
tool is deflected by action of the nonrotating slant
face on the soil. Significant torque is required to
turn the drill string in the soil when advancing along
a relatively straight path, the hydraulic power used
for rotation and thrust being in addition to the
pneumatic power required by the impactor in the mole.DE-A-2911419 discloses a cylindrical boring
device mounted (see Fig. 1) on the head of a drill
string. The device has measuring devices for its
location and carries a boring head which is provided
with a tip arranged so as to be displaceable on all
sides

<CLAIMS>
A moling apparatus for forming a generally
horizontal underground passage in soil for a utility

conduit or the like comprising:

tool head structure (24) that defines a tool axis
(54), said tool head structure including a base

portion (26) and a nose portion (28) mounted on said
base portion (26);
impact structure (23) for applying a series of
percussive impacts to said tool head structure for

driving said tool head structure through the earth by
displacing soil without necessity of soil removal;

said nose portion (28) being rotatable relative
to said base portion between a first position in which

said nose portion (28) has surfaces (74, 76) which are

straight path when said nose portion (28) is in said

first position and will move through the soil along a
curved path when said nose portion is in said second

position,
and further structure (30) being provided for
applying torsional force to said base portion to

rotate said base portion (26) about said tool axis
(54) relative to said nose portion (28) selectively to

shift said nose portion (28) between said first and
second positions;

characterised in that said nose portion is
mounted on said base portion for rotation about a

swash axis that is at an angle to said tool axis.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterised

characterised in that said impact structure (23) is

pneumatically actuated, and said torsionally stiff
structure is in air hose (30) for supplying

pressurised air to said impact structure.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 3, and further
including operator controllable torque generating

structure (32) for applying torsional force to said
air hose at the surface of the soil in which said

passage is to be formed.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 4, characterised

in that said impact structure (23) is pneumatically

actuated, and said torsionally stiff structure is an 
air hose (30) for supplying pressurised air to said

impact structure.
