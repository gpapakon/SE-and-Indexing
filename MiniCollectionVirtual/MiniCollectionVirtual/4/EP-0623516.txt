Apparatus for feeding packing enclosures, such as prospectuses, accompanying 
leaflets or the like, to packing material guided in a goods chain of a packing machine and 

formed by objects such as tubes, bottles, piles of blister packings or the like and pushed 
together with the packing enclosures into packing containers, particularly into collapsible 

boxes, which are guided in a packing container chain, with a packing enclosure conveyor 
by which the packing enclosures folded to form a strip (6) are conveyed between two 

endless conveyor belts (7', 7''), which rest against each other along their traject, as far as a 
delivery outlet (8) where the conveyor belts (7', 7'') are deflected in opposite directions by 

deflecting rollers (9', 9''), and with an endlessly circulating clamp pincer chain (3) having 
clamp pincers (2) which each grip an end (60) of the strip and feed it to the goods chain 

and which on receiving the packing enclosure strips (6) take their course in a substantially 
vertical transfer plane (20), while the packing enclosure strips (6), when taken over, are 

likewise aligned by their strip surface parallel to the transfer plane (20) and in their length 
are substantially transversal to the direction of movement of the clamp pincers (2), 

characterised in that for each packing enclosure strip (6) leaving the delivery orifice (8) 
of the packing enclosure conveyor, an intercepting compartment (21) is provided which 

secures the packing enclosure strip (6) in the position allocated for its reception by the 
clamp pincers (2) and from which the packing enclosure strip (6) extends in its 

longitudinal direction, by at least the end (60) to be gripped by the clamp pincers (2), into 
the path (2) of the clamp pincers, which receive the end (60) of the strip by the opening 

of the clamp pincer jaw, which in its direction of motion is directed forwards, and in that 
the intercepting compartment (21), for the emergence of the packing enclosure strip (6) 

gripped by the clamp pincers (2), is open in the direction of motion of the clamp pincers 
(2), and also in that the delivery orifice (8) of the packing enclosure conveyor is situated 

above the said compartment opening, the deflecting rollers (9', 9'') of its conveyor belts 
(7', 7'') being situated on the same side of the transfer plane (20) and at a sufficient 

distance from this latter to enable the packing enclosure strips (6) gripped by the clamp 
pincers (2) to move past. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that the intercepting 
compartment (21) is formed between two compartment walls (23, 24) which are 

interconnected at the bottom by a compartment floor (22) and of which the front  
 

interconnected at the bottom by a compartment floor (22) and of which the front 
compartment wall (24) is situated opposite the discharge orifice (8), in the transfer plane 

(20), while the rear compartment wall (23), by its upper compartment edge (23), 

immediately follows the discharge orifice (8). 
Apparatus according to Claim 2, characterised in that the front compartment wall 
(24) extends by its upper edge (24') to the level of that side of the clamp pincer chain (3) 

which runs parallel with the goods conveyor. 
Apparatus according to any one of Claims 1-3, characterised in that the conveyor 
belts (7', 7''), in front of and in the discharge orifice (8), slant from the top downwards at 

an acute angle (26) in relation to the transfer plane (20). 
Apparatus according to any one of Claims 2 to 4, characterised in that the 
deflecting rollers (9', 9'') for the conveyor belts (7', 7'') are positioned one above the 

other, with axes parallel to the transfer plane (20) and to the compartment floor (22), in 
such a way that their common tangential plane (27) situated on the side of the intercepting 

compartment (21), takes its course parallel to the transfer plane (20) and far enough from 
the front compartment wall (24) to enable the packing enclosure strips (6) to pass 

through. 
Apparatus according to Claim 5, characterised in that the lower deflecting roller 
(9'), with the conveyor belt (7') guided by it, extends through a cut-out (28) in the rear 

compartment wall (23) into the intercepting compartment (21), the upper edge (23') of 
the rear compartment wall (23) being situated underneath that part of the conveyor belt 

(7') which runs up onto the deflecting roller (9'). 
Apparatus according to any one of Claims 2 to 6, characterised in that the rear 
compartment wall (23) is inclined at an acute angle in relation to the transfer plane (20), 

so that the intercepting compartment (21) widens out in the direction of the upper edge 
(23') of the rear compartment wall (23), the said angle being smaller than that angle (26) 

in relation to the transfer plan (20) which is formed by the conveyor belts (7', 7'') in the 
discharge orifice (8). 
Apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that in the 
vicinity of the conveyor belts (7', 7''), at a short distance in front of the discharge orifice 

(8), a packing enclosure stopper (36) is provided which can be moved into the traject of  
 

and then forms a stop (36) which aligns the packing enclosure strips between the 
conveyor belts (7', 7'') and stops their further transport.
