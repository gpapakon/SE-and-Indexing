<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for depositing fibres on a wire (12) for the production of primarily paper 
products. The apparatus comprises, inter alia, the wire (12) and one or more 

distributors (1), which are diagonal in relation to the wire (12). This minimizes disadvantages 
which occur when using traditional apparatuses as, in the present invention, 

impellers (2) mounted in the distributor (1) are provided in rows (4) which, like the 
distributor (1), are arranged at an angle between 0° and 90° in relation to the direction 

of movement (D) of the wire (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for depositing
fibres on a wire by producing a substantially plane fibrous
web on the wire, said apparatus being provided with at least
one distributor which comprises a housing, means for supplying
fibres, and at least two parallel rows of impellers, which
rotate, when in use, mounted on axles which are substantially
perpendicular to the wire, said impellers being situated
between the supply means and a net behind which the wire is
provided in such a manner that the fibres will flow from the
supply means via the impellers and the net to the wire.In the production of napkins and new sanitary products,
especially sanitary towels for women and incontinent persons,
the possibilities of producing increasingly thin products have
increased in recent years. The consumers of course demand that
these napkins or sanitary towels have the same absorbency as
the previously known, more solid products. Therefore, it is
essential to maintain a homogeneous product quality as the
product is more optimized in thickness than it was previously.
For the manufacture of products of the above-mentioned type,
the web is subsequently cut into narrow strips which are used
in the final products. The manufacturer of such final products
demands that the strips cut from the web have a homogeneous
thickness in order to secure homogeneous product quality. The
homogeneous product quality is vital to the properties of the
products in subsequent treatment, but also in order to secure
that the products will occupy the very same volume when packed
and not more or less of the packaging volume for the same
amount of products.GB 2,008,638 discloses such an apparatus with several,
preferably four, parallel rows of rotating impellers. The rows
form a 90° angle on the axis along which a wire below extends,
and each of the rotating impellers rotates in its own section
of the distributor. A net is situated between the impellers
and the wire. This causes a sausage-shaped body of fibres to 
be formed between the parallel rows, the fibres falling or
being sucked gradually from said body down through the net and
onto the wire. It appears, however, that problems arise
related to keeping a homogeneous thickness profile over the
fibrous layer formed on the wire.SE 467,740 discloses an apparatus that seeks to remedy the
above problem. The apparatus used corresponds to the apparatus
disclosed in the above-mentioned British publication. The
difference consists in the use of a special net with different
mesh sizes.
