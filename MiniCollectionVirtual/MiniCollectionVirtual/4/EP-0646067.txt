<ABSTRACT>
A paper fastener for holding one or more sheets of paper without penetrating or damaging the paper comprises a generally channel-sectioned component (1) having a base (2) and opposed upper (4) and lower (3) arms between which the paper is received. The lower arm (3) forms a support surface for the paper whilst the upper arm (4) serves as or is provided with a gripping member to engage paper received between the arms (3, 4) and to bias the paper against the lower arm (3). At one end of the fastener the arms diverge away from each other to define an open mouth (11) which facilitates the introduction of paper into the fastener.

<DESCRIPTION>
THE PRESENT INVENTION relates to a paper fastener and more 
particularly to a paper fastener which may be used to hold 
one sheet of paper or to join together several sheets of 
paper without penetrating or damaging the paper. Previously proposed paper fasteners for joining 
together several sheets of paper without penetrating or 
damaging the paper have included paper clips formed from a 
folded length of wire. These conventional paper clips are 
provided in several different sizes since any one size of 
clip is only capable of holding a limited number of sheets 
of paper within a relatively narrow range. It is often 
desirable to label bundles of paper which are held together 
by means of paper clips and, unless the separate bundles 
are placed in folders, files or the like there is no simple 
way of marking the various bundles so that the label or 
marking is readily visible when several bundles or paper 
are stacked on top of each other. One example of a clip, which is intended for use to 
secure together a bundle of cheques in a cheque book, is 
shown in US Patent No. 3023474. This document shows an 
elongate clip having a base and a pair of legs between 
which a channel is formed. One of the legs is of greater 
overall dimension than the other so as to project beyond 
the edges thereof in order to permit mounting of that leg 
on a cover of a cheque book. Whilst the free edges of one 
of the arms are bent slightly outwardly, the channel 
defined by the clip is of substantially cross-section and 
the insertion of a bundle of cheques into the clip 
necessitates that the arms be forced apart. This can be an 
awkward operation to effect whilst simultaneously trying to 
insert the paper between the arms.  
 A further design of this type of clip is shown in 
GB 2206922A. The clip shown in this document is an 
integrally moulded plastics component. The clip again 
defines a channel between two arms which are interconnected 
by an arcuate portion 12. One of the arms has cut-away 
portions adjacent its ends which serve, to some degree, to 
facilitate the insertion of paper into the clip. Whilst 
these cut-away portions have edges which are upturned so as 
to define "wing portions", again the clip is of 
substantially constant cross-section over its length and it 
would still be a relatively awkward task to introduce a 
bundle of papers into the clip. In addition a separate tab 
component has to be provided with the clip in order to 
carry information. Another document which discloses clips of this 
general

<CLAIMS>
A paper fastener comprises a generally channel-sectioned 
component (1) having a base (2) and first and 

second opposed arms (3,4) between which an elongate channel 
is defined, the base (2) of the channel-section having a 

substantially planar outer surface which provides a region 
adapted to be written upon, one of the opposed arms (3) 

forming a supporting surface for the paper and the other 
arm (4) serving as a gripping member which engages paper 

received within the channel-section between the arms (3,4) 
and biasses the paper against the opposed arm (3), the arms 

(3,4) of the channel-sectioned fastener diverging away from 
each other in a direction towards one end of the channel-section 

such that the elongate channel is of a different, 
greater cross-sectional area at said one end, the diverging 

arms (3,4) extending substantially parallel with each other 
in cross-section at said one end and forming an open mouth 

(11) which facilitates the introduction of paper into the 
fastener, the first arm (3) projecting beyond the second 

arm (4) at the end of the fastener provided with the open 
mouth (11), the projecting portion (10) of the first arm 

(3) forming a platform upon which the edge of one or more 
sheets of paper is supported when the paper is to be 

inserted into the fastener. 
A paper fastener according to Claim 1, wherein the 
free edges of the opposed arms (3,4) engage each other when 

the fastener is not in use. 
A paper fastener according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
wherein the base (2) and the first arm (3) of the generally 

channel-sectioned component (1) extend at right angles to 
each other in cross-section and the second arm (4) extends 

from an edge of the base (2) in a direction towards the 
free edge of the first arm (3).  

 
A paper fastener according to Claim 3, wherein the 
second arm (4) extends downwardly from an uppermost edge of 

the base (2) to engage the upper surface of the first arm 
(3). 
A paper fastener according to Claim 4, wherein the 
inwardly directed surface of the second arm (4) carries an 

inwardly directed tooth (9) which engages the inwardly 
directed surface of the first arm (3). 
A paper fastener according to Claim 5, wherein the 
inwardly directed surface of the first arm (3) carries one 

or more teeth or ridges (8), the teeth or ridges (8) being 
formed at that point on the first arm (3) which is engaged 

by the tooth (9) formed on the lower surface of the second 
arm (4). 
A paper fastener according to any one of the 
preceding Claims, wherein the open mouth (11) at one end of 

the fastener is defined between the first and second arms 
(3,4), the free edge of the second arm (4) extending from 

a position adjacent the free edge of the first arm (3) up 
to the level of the uppermost edge of the base (2) and then 

extending substantially parallel to the first arm (3) to 
connect with the uppermost edge of the base (2). 
A paper fastener according to any one of the 
preceding Claims, wherein the base (2) and part of one arm 

(4) of the channel-sectioned component (1) each define a 
planar outer surface which provides a region adapted to be 

written upon. 
A paper fastener according to Claim 8, wherein the 
base (2) and part of both arms (3,4) of the channel-sectioned  

 
component (1) each define a planar outer surface 

which provides a region adapted to be written upon.
