<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a novel automated industrial washing machine for laundry articles; it loads the laundry articles to be washed automatically from above by means of movable baskets or shuttles (CC) and unloads the washed laundry articles automatically downwards onto a conveyor band (N); it automatically opens and closes the loading and unloading flaps (P1, P2) which are located on the cylindrical surfaces of the rotary drum and of the tub (V) respectively. The washing machine is also equipped with a system which redistributes the load during spinning.

<CLAIMS>
Washing machine comprising a housing (V) having an upper
charging port an a lower discharging port and a drum (2)

rotating in said housing on a horizontal axis, the cylindrical
wall of said drum having apertures for charging and discharging,

to each of them being associated a flap (3) hinged to a
horizontal axis (4) and connected to an automatic opening and

closing mechanism, characterized in that under said discharging
port of the housing a belt conveyor (N) for washed clothes is

positioned, whereas to the charging port an elevator (H) is
associated having a loading basket (Cc) which is vertically

displaceable and tiltable above said charging port, wherein the
opening and closing mechanism of said flaps (3) hinged to the

cylindrical wall of the drum (2) comprises locking elements
acting radially as well as in a direction parallel to the axis.
Washing machine according to claim 1, wherein said radially
acting locking elements are in the form of noses (11b)

projecting radially from the drum (2) towards its outer side and
attached to the edge (10) of each opening opposite to the

corresponding horizontal axis (4) and engaging bores (11a) of
the closed flap (3) which are provided in its free edge opposite

to the horizontal axis (4).
Washing machine according to claim 2, wherein the free edge
of each flap (3) is provided, in addition to said bores (11a),

with recesses (13) extending circumferentially and being open
towards said free end, said recesses (13) being engaged by

fingers (10a) for releasing a flap (3) to be opened, said
fingers projecting from a locking bar (10) which may be shifted

in a direction parallel to the axis. 
Washing machine according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein the opening and closing mechanism comprises an actuating

lever mounted at the housing (V) such that it extends in a
direction parallel to the axis, which lever may be tilted into a

radially outer position in which its free end (6a) engages a
crank lever (5) of said flap (3), said crank lever (5) being

positioned at that side of the axis (4) opposite to the free
edge of the f
lap, wherein said crank lever (5), in its inwardly
tilted position, opens said flap (3).
