<ABSTRACT>
Method for the storage and controlled supply of electric 
energy for discontinuous loads in steelworks and in 

particular for metal melting systems and rolling mills, the 
method comprising at least one main supply line (18) 

connected to a main supply source (11) of electric energy 
and a plurality of loads (12-13-14-114-20), whereby the 

level of maximum active power supplied by that main supply 
source (11) to the steelworks is limited by a sub-station 

(27) to a level "Pâ‚€" lower than the peaks of maximum 
absorption by those loads (12-13-14-114-20), the method 

comprising at least one accumulation line (16) connected in 
parallel to the main supply line (18) and supplying at least 

one storage assembly (17), which is connected to the loads 
(12-13-14-114-20) through a secondary supply line (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method for the storage and 
controlled supply of electric energy to a plurality of discontinuous loads 
in a steelworks, as set forth in the main claim. To be more exact, the method according to the invention 
provides for the reduction of peaks of power absorbed from 
the electrical supply network according to the highly 
variable conditions of load and of working of the devices 
functioning in the steelworks, especially as regards 
electric furnaces and rolling mills. One of the most important problems encountered in 
steelworks relates to the supply of electric energy by the 
supplying Authority. It is known that the very high power required for the 
working of the various devices is faced with the limited 
power of the electricity lines and with the Authority's 
requirement to have a constant load in those lines. This entails for the steelworks the burden of particularly 
harsh contracts, since electric furnaces in particular have 
in their various working steps very variable conditions of 
load requiring peaks of active power much higher than the 
mean absorbed power. In fact, the typical working cycle of electric furnaces is 
characterised by a considerable variability and 
discontinuity of the value of the absorbed electrical power. A steel melting furnace changes typically from a maximum 
value of absorbed power, when it is engaged in the melting 
step, to a substantially nil absorption during the step of 
tapping and of charging scrap. In some intermediate working steps, such as perforation 
for instance, the furnace has a given absorption which is  
 
less than the maximum value. The inclusion of a ladle furnace for secondary metallurgy, 
even if it requires a power much less than that required by 
a melting furnace, contributes to the worsening of the 
situation inasmuch as the ladle furnace absorbs the maximum 
power for a shorter period than the cycle of the melting 
furnace. Where there are common rolling mills for the production of 
strip and wide flats, it is known that the slab leaving the 
continuous casting plant is generally sheared to size in 
segments which are then sent to the rolling mill stands. This method entails very high peaks of power when the 
rolling mill stands start working, these peaks lasting for 
a very short time; this involves the installation of 
electric lines able to withstand these peaks. So as to avoid this problem, all steelworks normally 
employ the technique of restricting costs by using a lower 
power than that required and

<CLAIMS>
Method for the storage and controlled supply of electric 
energy to a plurality of discontinuous loads in a steelworks 

containing at least one furnace for the melting of metals 
which is linked to at least one rolling mill, the steelworks 

being connected to the main supply source of electric energy 
(11) through a main supply line (18), which is connected to 

the plurality of discontinuous loads (12, 13, 14, 114, 20), 
the method being characterised in that it arranges: 


the limitation, by means of a sub-station (27), of the 
level of the maximum active power supplied by the source 

(11) to the steelworks to a level "P
0
" lower than the value 
of the peaks of maximum absorption of those discontinuous 

loads (12, 13, 14, 114, 20), 
the provision of an accumulation line (16) connected to 
the main supply line (18) and of a secondary supply line (19) so as to feed at least one storage 

assembly (17) storing electric energy and connected to the 
plurality of discontinuous loads (12, 13, 14, 114, 20) 

through said secondary supply line (19), 
the supply of the electric energy accumulated by the 
storage assembly (17) to that plurality of discontinuous 

loads (12, 13, 14, 114, 20) through that secondary supply 
line (19) when the loads absorb a value of 

electric energy greater than "P
0
", and 
 
the provision of the sub-station (27), the storage assembly (17), the 

accumulation line (16) and the secondary supply line (19) 
as an integral part of the system of supply of the 

steelworks and being positioned downstream of the connection 
between the main supply line (18) and the main supply source 

(11). 
Method as in Claim 1, in which the storage assembly (17) 
has a first accumulation condition when the overall 

absorption of the discontinuous loads (12, 13, 14, 114, 20) 
connected to the main supply source (11) is lower than the  

 
level "P
0
", and a second supply condition when the overall 
absorption of the loads connected to the main supply source 

(11) is greater than the level "P
0
". 
Method as in Claim 1 or 2, in which the storage assembly 
(17) in the first accumulation condition is fed through 

converter devices (28) belonging to the loads (12) 
themselves. 
Method as in Claim 1 or 2, in which the storage assembly 
(17) in the second supply condition feeds, directly and 

without a preliminary conversion and redistribution, loads 
fed with direct current (14). 
Method as in any claim hereinbefore, in which the 
storage assembly (17) in the second supply condition feeds 

the loads through transformer systems (15) belonging to the 
loads themselves. 
Method as in any claim hereinbefore, in which the level 
"P
0
" is so calculated that the energy stored in the storage 
assembly (17) has at all times a value of 10-20% in relation 

to the condition of maximum stored energy.
