<ABSTRACT>
A process for forming a beer flavored concentrate by germinating barely (e.g., in the presence of the enzyme promoting agent gibberellic acid) to produce a green malt of approximately 43 % moisture content that is heated in a closed container at 85 DEG  to 95  DEG C for 2 to 6 hours (i.e., raising the internal bed temperature to 70 DEG  to 89  DEG C for one half to 3 hours) to reduce amylolytic enzyme activity. By kiln drying in an opened container (e.g. at 50 DEG  to 65  DEG C for 12 to 18 hours) an amylolytic enzyme deficient green malt of 3.5 to 5.5 wt.% moisture content is produced. This dried malt when used to make a mash (e.g. upon grinding and the addition of brewing water) results in the preparation of a wort that when boiled and pitched with brewers yeast can be fermented by conventional methods. The fermented wot can be diluted with water to yield a malt beverage containing less than 0.5 volume % alcohol and less than 40 calories per 12 ounces or alternatively concentrated by vacuum evaporation, freeze concentration, spray-drying and/or freeze drying to produce an intense beer flavored product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a 
concentrated beer flavor product. U. S. 3,689,277 discloses a process for producing a malt flavor base 
for use in foodstuffs, particularly non-alcoholic beverages. The process involves 
grinding a high protein content grain seed, such as high protein barley, followed 
by an aqueous enzymatic treatment to extract the protein preferentially from the 
grain as compared with carbohydrates. The starch content of the extract is 
hydrolyzed by treatment with amylolytic enzyme to provide starch-free solution 
which is mixed with sugar and dried by heating to impart a caramel flavor. U. S. 3,711,292 discloses producing a concentrated protein 
hydrolysate substantially free of starch by heating a starchy proteinaceous cereal 
grain with an aqueous proteolytic enzyme to produce a solution containing 
soluble protein hydrolysis products together with a starchy carbohydrate fraction, 
separating the solution from undissolved residue, and treating the separated 
solution with amylolytic enzyme to produce a starch-free solution. The product is 
useful as a flavor precursor for beer or may be incorporated in a sugary 
fermentation wort to produce a wort low in unfermentable carbohydrates. U. S. 3,717,471 discloses a low carbohydrate beer produced by 
subjecting barley malt to aqueous extraction conditions favorable to extraction of 
protein while unfavorable to the extraction of carbohydrate, adding a highly  
 
fermentable sugar to the resulting extract to produce a brewers wort low in 
unfermentable carbohydrates, and fermenting the resulting wort. The present invention relates to a process for preparing a malt 
beverage with intensified beer flavor properties. This process employs a barley 
malt which is specially prepared to have high soluble protein and very low 
amylase levels. Malts produced for brewing beer are carefully made to contain the 
enzymes, extract and nitrogen necessary to perform well in the brewhouse, 
ferment well and result in a fermented malt beverage that has the physical and 
organoleptic attributes that are familiar to and desired by the consumer. Such 
malts are not suited for producing an intensified beer flavor. Other specialty malts with more intense flavor are commercially 
available, but these are usually produced by using higher kiln finishing 
temperatures which result in a predominant caramel aroma and flavor in the 
finished product. Dextrine or crystal malt, for example, is made by heating high 
moisture green

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a dried malt having a reduced content of 
amylase enzymes which comprises germinating barley by steeping in water to produce 

a green malt, heating the green malt in an oven at an internal bed temperature of 70째C 
to 89째C for 1/2 to 6 hours to reduce amylolytic enzyme activity and kiln drying the 

resulting amylolytic enzyme reduced green malt to produce a dried malt having a 
moisture content of 3.5 to 5.5 weight percent water. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the green malt is heated for a 
period of 0.5 to 3 hours. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein the green malt has a 
moisture content of about 45% by weight after the heating step. 
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the 
green malt is held in a sealed oven while heated therein. 
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the 
kiln drying comprises blowing air through the bed of green malt. 
A process as claimed in claim 5 wherein the initial exit temperature of 
the air is 70 to 85째C and the inlet air temperature is reduced to 55 to 65째C for 12 to 

20 hours. 
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the 
germinating barley is treated with an enzyme-promoting agent. 
A process as claimed in claim 7 wherein the enzyme-promoting agent is 
gibberellic acid.  

 
A process for preparing a fermented wort which comprises making a 
mash from the dried malt produced by the process claimed in any one of the preceding 

claims, by grinding and adding brewing water, thus producing a wort and a residue, 
separating the wort from the residue, boiling the wort, cooling and pitching the boiled 

wort with yeast to produce a pitched wort and fermenting the pitched wort to produce 
a fermented wort. 
A process as claimed in claim 9 wherein hops are added to the wort 
during the boiling. 
A process as claimed in claim 9 or 10 wherein the fermenting wort is 
treated with toasted barley protein extract. 
A process as claimed in any one of claims 9 to 11 wherein the 
fermented wort is diluted with water to produce a malt beverage containing less than 

0.5 volume percent alcohol and less than 420 joules per litre (40 calories per 12 fluid 
ounces). 
A process as claimed in any one of claims 9 to 11 wherein the 
fermented wort is spray-dried or freeze-dried to produce an intense beer flavoured 

solid.
