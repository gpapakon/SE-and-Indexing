<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aluminide coatings for
aluminizing of heat resistant alloy substrates, to the slurry
coating compositions for the coatings and to a process for
applying such coatings, more specifically to composite
coatings containing aluminum-rich and silicon-rich phases to
improve their resistance to hot corrosion and oxidation.During operation, components in the turbine section of a
gas turbine are exposed to combustion gas temperatures that
can reach 1200째C (2200째F). These components are typically made
of nickel and cobalt base superalloys specially formulated for
strength at these temperatures. However, upon exposure to
oxygen in the combustion gases at such high temperatures,
these heat resistant materials begin to revert to their
natural metal oxide form. The nickel and cobalt oxide scales
that form on the surfaces of these alloys are not tightly
adherent. During thermal cycling, they crack and spall off
the surface exposing more unreacted substrate to the
environment. In this manner, oxidation roughens and
eventually consumes unprotected parts made of these alloys.
See Figure 1. Adding sodium and contaminants containing
chlorine and sulphur to the combustion gases speeds
degradation. Above about 540째C (1004째F), sodium and sulphur
react to form low melting point sulphate salts which not only
dissolve the oxide films on nickel and cobalt, but also can
directly attack the substrates. See Figure 2.One solution to the hot corrosion and oxidation problem
which is widely applied in gas turbine engines, is to allow
aluminum into the surface of a superalloy component, a process
known as aluminizing. Aluminum forms stable intermetallic
compounds with both nickel and cobalt. The oxide layer which
forms on these compounds at high temperature is no longer a
metal oxide of nickel or cobalt, but rather a tough, tightly
adherent, protective layer of alumina, A1203. See Figure 3.A variety of commercial coatings are based upon this
protection scheme. Sometimes aluminum is deposited from a
vapor phase in a process that has come to be known as pack
aluminizing. In pack aluminizing, aluminum powder is reacted
with halide activators to form gaseous compounds which
condense on the metal surface and react producing aluminum
metal. The aluminum atoms diffuse into the substrate,
reacting to produce intermetallic aluminides. This process
has been described in detail in a number of patents, including
U.S. Patent No 3,257,230 (Wochtell et al). This patent is
incorporated herein by reference.State-of-the-art MCrAlY
