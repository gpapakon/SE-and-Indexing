<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for 
producing high levels of functional recombinant proteins in 

adenovirus-transformed mammalian cells by incubating cells 
capable of producing recombinant proteins at a temperature 

range between about 38 degrees centigrade and about 39 
degrees centigrade. The method allows for higher levels of 

expression of total protein in some cell lines and higher 
levels of functional protein in other cell lines.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to molecular biology,
particularly to methods for the production of high levels
of functional recombinant protein C in mammalian cell
lines.Many proteins undergo extensive post-translational
modification during maturation. Human
Protein C (HPC) is gamma-carboxylated, beta-hydroxylated
and glycosylated either during or soon after translation of
the primary RNA transcript. Many cell lines, such as the
Syrian Hamster AV12 cell line, are incapable of efficiently
processing these post-translational modifications therefore
the protein C molecules produced in these cell lines are
not fully functional. Other cell lines, such as the Human
Kidney 293 cell line, produce fully functional protein C
molecules but the levels of expression of the protein C
molecules in these cell lines are somewhat low. The
present invention relates to methods for increasing the
level of production of fully functional protein C in those
cell lines which do not ordinarily produce fully functional
molecules. The invention also relates to methods for
increasing the level of total production of protein C
molecules in those cell lines which ordinarily produce
fully functional molecules. The methods of the present
invention concern culturing the protein C producing cell
lines at temperatures greater than the common incubation
temperature of 37°C.For purposes of the present invention, as
disclosed and claimed herein, the following terms are as
defined below.Adenovirus-transformed cell line - a cell line
which expresses the E1A gene product of an adenovirus. Human protein C - Human protein C zymogen and
activated human protein C.Nascent protein - the polypeptide produced upon
translation of an mRNA transcript, prior to any post-translational
modifications. However, post-translational
modifications such as gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid
residues and hydroxylation of aspartic acid residues may
begin to occur before a protein is fully translated from an
mRNA transcript.Protein C Activity - any property of human
protein C responsible for proteolytic, amidolytic,
esterolytic, and biological (anticoagulant or pro-fibrinolytic)
activities. Methods for testing for protein
anticoagulant activity are well known in the art, i.e., see
Grinnell et.al., 1987, Bio/Technology5:1189-1192.Zymogen- an enzymatically inactive precursor of
a proteolytic enzyme. Protein C zymogen, as used herein,
refers to secreted, inactive forms, whether one chain or
two chain, of protein C.All amino acid abbreviations used in this
disclosure are those
