<ABSTRACT>
A scanning system that is forward looking that uses ultrasound for intraluminal imaging. A transducer (40) that emits ultrasonic signals is nutatably mounted on the tip of a probe (48). The front mounted transducer (40) enables intraluminal scanning of an oncoming area or volume as the probe moves to a selected position in a lumen or body cavity. Cables (52, 54, 56) are used to nutate the transducer so as to provide spiral or raster scanning patterns. The cables are driven by programmable electromagnetic drives (118, 124). Three dimensional images are then obtained from the reflected ultrasonic signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ultrasonic imaging system and, more
particularly, to such a system that employs an ultrasonic transducer which is
mounted on a probe member to provide an ultrasonic scan of an area or
volume in front of the probe.There are many medical procedures where imaging of blood
vessels and other body lumens or internal cavities is desirable in order to
ascertain the extent of plaque, stenosis, obstructions or other pathologies that
may exist. A prior art technique of providing an image of a lumen employs X-ray
fluoroscopy. In X-ray fluoroscopy, a contrast agent is sent through an
artery of interest. The contrast agent is visible under X-ray radiation which
enables an X-ray system to provide an image of the arterial obstruction.
However, such X-ray imaging techniques have disadvantages. An X-ray image
of an arterial obstruction is a profile of the contrast agent as it flows through
the artery. Therefore, the images provided are generally of the contrast agent
in a single plane of view, not of the tissue. Moreover, the true lumen diameter
is generally not provided by these images. In addition, the characteristics of
the plaque within the artery are not provided, which is important in
determining the success of a possible angioplasty procedure. Another
disadvantage is the potential harmful effects of the radiation to the patient and
attending medical personnel. Furthermore, there is potential for additional
harmful effects due to the contrast agent.Other prior art imaging techniques utilize catheter technology to
obtain an image of an area within a body lumen. One such system utilizes a
catheter and a transducer, as shown in FIG. 1, in conjunction with an 
ultrasound imaging system to provide an image of an area. Ultrasonic imaging
techniques are well suited for the imaging of the soft tissue found in body
lumens. Moreover, ultrasonic energy is useful in the location of a catheter that
has been directed into a body. In this regard, reference is made to U.S. Patent
No. 5,076,278 entitled ANNULAR ULTRASONIC TRANSDUCERS
EMPLOYING CURVED SURFACES USEFUL IN CATHETER
LOCALIZATION which issued on December 31, 1991 to Vilkomerson et al.
In addition, ultrasonic energy is not detrimental to the health or safety of
attending physicians or other medical personnel.In prior art ultrasound imaging systems, a transducer is utilized
that emits an ultrasonic imaging beam. The transducer is fastened about the
outside circumference of a catheter and the ultrasonic imaging beam emanates
perpendicular to the
