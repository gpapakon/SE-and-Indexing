<ABSTRACT>
A packaging machine (1) is adapted to form a web 
(8) of packaging material into a tube to surround items (3) 

to be packed, the tube then being sealed and severed between 
successive items to produce individual packages (5). The 

tube is formed by sealing one surface of an edge zone of the 
web to the same surface of the opposite edge zone of the web 

so that, in the finished package, the sealed zones form a 
flap extending longitudinally of the package. The machine 

comprises a machine bed (2) and successive pairs of rollers 
(18,20,22) located in the machine bed forming successive 

nips for driving the partly formed packages (25,38) towards 
a sealing and severing station (23) and for forming the 

required seal between the edge zones of the web, wherein the 
edge of at least one of at least one of the pairs of 

rollers (18;20), located adjacent the partly formed 
packages, is relieved whereby an air passage is formed 

within the tube at the point where the tube passes the 
relevant pair of rollers as it moves towards the sealing and 

severing station (23). The machine additionally comprises 
means (32,34) for applying a vacuum to the tube adjacent the 

point where the edge zones of the web are brought together 
to form the tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a packaging machine, and 
more particularly to a packaging machine of the type in 
which a web of packaging material is formed into a tube to 
surround the items to be packed and the tube is then sealed 
and severed between successive items to produce individual 
packages. The invention is more particularly concerned with 
packaging machinery of this type in which the tube is formed 
by sealing one surface of an edge zone of the web to the 
same surface of the opposite edge zone of the web so that, 
in the finished package, the sealed zones form a flap 
extending longitudinally of the package. Packaging machines of the type described above are 
commonly used in the food manufacturing industry, more 
particularly for the packaging of biscuits and similar 
items. For the purposes of illustration the invention will 
be described in the context of a biscuits packaging machine. 
It should be appreciated, however, that the invention is of 
more general applicability and may be used in a wide range 
of packaging machines of the type described above. In the packaging of biscuits by such machines the 
biscuits may already be held in containers of card or 
plastics material, for example, or they may be loose and 
simply assembled together into groups, each group being 
intended to be packaged to form a single packet of biscuits. 
In the latter case, the packaging machine bed is horizontal 
and the biscuits are arranged vertically - i.e. the  
 
biscuits stand on edge - as they are fed into the packaging 
machine by means of a conveyor. The groups of biscuits are 
automatically spaced apart by a distance sufficient to 
enable the packaging tube, between consecutive groups of 
biscuits, to be sealed and severed to form the individual 
packets required. In machines of the prior art, the apparatus for 
sealing and severing the tube to form individual packets is 
typically located several packet lengths downstream of the 
tube forming station. This arrangement leads to two 
recognized disadvantages. Firstly, between the tube forming 
station and the tube severing station the biscuits must be 
supported and maintained in their pre-formed groups. In 
particular, because the biscuits are standing on edge, care 
must be taken to prevent the leading or trailing biscuit in 
each group from falling over. Because, along the relevant 
portion of the machine length, the biscuits are totally 
enclosed by the tube it is not possible to support the 
biscuits directly by means of fingers extending from the

A packaging machine (1) adapted to form a web (8) 
of packaging material into a tube to surround items (3) to 

be packed, the tube then being closed, sealed and severed 
between successive items (3) to produce individual packages 

(24), the tube being formed by sealing one surface of an 
edge zone (10) of the web (8) to the same surface of the 

opposite edge zone (11) of the web (8) so that, in the 
finished package, the sealed zones (10,11) form a flap 

extending longitudinally of the package (24), the machine 
comprising a support surface (2), at least two pairs of 

rollers (17,18;19,20) forming successive nips for driving 
the partly formed packages (25) along the support surface 

towards a closing, sealing and severing station (23) and for 
forming the required seal between the edge zones (10,11) of 

the web, and means (32,34) for applying a vacuum to the tube 
adjacent the point where the edge zones (10,11) of the web 

(8) are brought together to form the tube, characterised in 
that the edge (27) of at least one roller (18) of at least 

the first pair of rollers (17,18) downstream of the point of 
application of the vacuum is relieved whereby an air passage 

(29) is formed within the tube at the point where the tube 
passes the relevant pair of rollers (17,18) as it moves 

towards the closing, sealing and severing station (23). 
A machine according to claim 1, characterised in 
that both rollers (17,18;19,20) at each nip, except the 

final nip, are relieved by a chamfer (28) whereby, as the 
package passes each of the relieved rollers, a generally 

triangular zone (29) is formed inside the web (8) between 
the web lying against the chamfered rollers (17,18;19,20) 

and the lower face of the item (3) being packaged. 
A machine according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that the top surface of each roller forms 

part of the support surface (2) along which the partly 
formed packages (25) move.  

 
A machine according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the means for applying a vacuum 

comprises a housing (32) which, in combination with the 
support surface (2), substantially surrounds the point where 

the edge zones (10,11) of the web (8) are brought together 
to form the tube. 
A machine according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the support surface (2) is provided with slots which 

form guides (13,14;15,16) for bringing the edge zones 
(10,11) of the web (8) together to form the tube and wherein 

the housing (32) is located beneath the slots and extends 
beneath the first pair of rollers (17,18) to the point where 

the nip is formed between the first pair of rollers 
(17,18). 
A machine according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the housing (32) seals against the underside of the 

support surface (2) and closely abuts the underside of the 
first pair of rollers (17,18). 
A machine according to any preceding claim, 
characterised by comprising three successive pairs of 

rollers (17,18;19,20;21,22).
