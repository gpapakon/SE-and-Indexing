<ABSTRACT>
A filtering device has a filter container from whose inner chamber dust-laden crude air outwardly flows after being cleaned through outwardly open filtering cartridges set into openings of the container lid. A compressed air cleaning device has a compressed air container and compressed air nozzles linked thereto and arranged above the filter openings. The compressed air container with the compressed air nozzles and their connections forms a rigid unit swivellingly and/or removably held by a holding device on the filter container. The compressed air device can thus be easily and quickly removed from the area of the inserted filter cartridges and these can be easily removed or inserted. Another advantage of the invention is its modular design which allows existing filtering systems to be retrofitted or backfitted.
