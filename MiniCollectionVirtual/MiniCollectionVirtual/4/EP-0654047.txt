<DESCRIPTION>
GLUCANS WITH IMMtTNOSTIMPLANT ACTIVITYThe present invention refers to im unostimulant glucans, to a process for their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.Glucan is a polysaccharide occurring in nature in the cell wall of fungine microorganism, particularly of yeasts.Glucans from different sources, e.g. from different microorganisms, are different one from the other and moreover different extraction processes and treatments to which said microorganisms are subjected, including cultural and maintenance conditions, yield different final products. These differences can be noticed both in the three-dimensional structure of the polysaccharide chain, or in the chemical bonds between glucopyranoside units of said chain, and in the biological activity of the glucans as well as in the presence of substances other than glucan in the crude product with consequently greater or lesser difficulties in the purification. Glucans from Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from Lentinus edodes, both having a branched structure with predominance of β-l,3-glucopyranoside bonds, are known.Said glucans are particularly studied because of their antitumoral and antibacterial activity (Int. J. Cancer 24, 773-779 (1979); Int. J. Immunopharmacol. Vol. 7 No. 5, 747-751 (1985)). Furthermore, they exhibit an immunomodulator effect both in vivo and in vitro (Rev. icrobiol. Vol. 15, 87-96, 1987) and exert a radioprotective action (Methods and Findings Explt. 

Pharmacol. Vol. 8, No. 3, 151-155 (1986)).Glucans have been produced also starting from Candida albicans and the immunomodulator effect thereof has been studied (J. Gen. Microbiol. Vol. 134, 1265-74 (1988)).EP-A-0416343 (16.08.1990) discloses the preparation of parietal glucanic bodies consisting of at least 90% glucan and partly of chitin, by extraction from the strain of Candida albicans ATCC 20955. The process for the preparation of this product, the biological properties of which are not described and which is in fact described as an intermediate useful for the preparation of final products purified to a degree compatible with the pharmaceutical use, comprises the treatment of the cells in autoclave and subsequent repeated extractions with sodium hydroxide and acetic acid at high temperature.US patent No. 4992540 (12.02.1991) discloses glucans extracted from Saccharomyces cerevisiae as alimentary additives.We have now found glucans characterized by particularly high immunostimulant activity and by a remarkable safety thanks to the absence of impurities which
