<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to clad vanadium
pentoxide materials, to antistat layers containing such
materials and to photographic elements containing an
antistat layer containing the vanadium pentoxide clad
materials.U.S. Patent 4,203,769 teaches a method of
preparation for vanadium pentoxide and the use of such
materials in antistat layers of various types,
primarily for use in photographic elements.U.S. Patent 5,006,451 is an improvement over
the previously mentioned patent in that it provides for
barrier layers over the vanadium pentoxide containing
layer in order to impart a high level of permanent
antistatic protection to the vanadium pentoxide layer.
This barrier layer, for example, prevents the diffusion
of the vanadium pentoxide from the photographic element
during processing thereof. This diffusion represents a
serious problem in that once the vanadium pentoxide is
removed the antistatic action of the layer is no longer
available.There is a need in the industry to provide
vanadium pentoxide, fibrous structures and layers that
are not susceptible to the diffusing out of the
vanadium pentoxide and the disadvantages associated
therewith including the loss of antistat properties.
It is also a need to provide user-friendly methods and
techniques for protecting vanadium pentoxide containing
articles from this disadvantage. Further, there is a
need to provide protection for vanadium pentoxide
containing articles of manufacture which is both 
transparent and colorless and not affected by ranges in
humidity conditions.This invention provides for the protection of
vanadium pentoxide containing articles by providing a
cladding to the articles, the cladding being the
oxidation product of an oxidatively polymerizable
compound. The vanadium pentoxide articles can be
formed of fibrous vanadium pentoxide or can be made up
of layers of fibrous vanadium pentoxide prior to the
cladding operation. By the term "clad" or "cladding"
is meant that the fibers or articles of vanadium
pentoxide are coated with a continuous film of the
polymer resulting from the oxidation of an oxidatively
polymerizable compound or that a discontinuous film is
formed on the surface of the vanadium pentoxide
material.The term "vanadium pentoxide" as used herein
includes both vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) per se, as well
as doped vanadium pentoxide, the doping being other
elements such as silver, lithium fluoride, calcium
oxide, zinc oxide, silica, lithium carbonate, boron
oxide, lithium tetraborate and the like.While the invention is applicable to
