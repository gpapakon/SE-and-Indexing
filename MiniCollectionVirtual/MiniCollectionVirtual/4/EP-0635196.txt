<ABSTRACT>
A broadcaster for pourable spreading material consists of a supply container with at least one outflow orifice and at least one centrifugal disc (5) having at least one two-part throwing wing (11, 12), the inner wing part (11) of which is mounted pivotably in the disc plane near the centre of the disc in order to adjust the angle of incidence of the throwing wing and is guided at a distance therefrom in an arcuate slot of the disc and the outer wing part (12) of which is displaceable relative to the inner wing part (11) by means of a longitudinal slot in order to adjust the wing length. So as to allow a positive fixing of the throwing wing in any setting and without the aid of a tool, provision is made for the disc (5) and the outer wing part (12) to have catch receptacles, and for a single catch means (19) to engage into the congruent catch receptacles.
