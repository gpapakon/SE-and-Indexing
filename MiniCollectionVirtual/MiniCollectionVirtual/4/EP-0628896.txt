<ABSTRACT>
An improved process for positioning a bevel along the 
edge of an opthamalic lens computes point-to-wheel data 

definitive of a planar relationship between the lens and the 
wheel, stores the point-to-wheel data, computes corrected 

horizontal displacement data definitive of a three dimensional 
relationship between the lens, the wheel and a plot of 

sequential contact points therebetween using the computed 
point-to-wheel data, stores the corrected horizontal 

displacement data, and controls the relative positions of the 
edging wheel and the lens in response to the corrected 

horizontal displacement data. 
The point-to-wheel data is computed by sequentially 
testing at successive incremental points of the point-to-wheel 

data at a beginning reference angle of the lens to determine 
a transition point at which the wheel ceases to increase and 

begins to decrease its displacement from the lens. 
This sequential testing is repeated at successive 
incremental points for sequentially successive incremental 

changes in the reference angle to determine a transition point 
for each incremental change. 
The corrected horizontal displacement data is computed by 
sequentially testing at successive incremental angles of a 

radius originating at a center of rotation of the lens at a 
beginning reference angle of the lens to determine an 

incremental angle at which the lens initiates contact with the 
wheel. This sequential testing is repeated at successive 

incremental angles at each sequentially successive incremental 
change in the reference angle to determine an incremental 

angle at which the lens initiates contact with the wheel for 
each incremental change. 
Preferably, the beginning reference angles and the 
successive incremental changes in the reference angle of the  

 
point-to-wheel computing and the corrected horizontal 

displacement computing are identical and sequential testing at 
successive incremental points and at successive incremental 

angles occurs simultaneously for each sequentially successive 
incremental change in the reference angle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the edging of
ophthalmic lenses and more particularly concerns a process for
improving the bevel control operation of a lens edging
machine. The control bevel operation of a lens edging machine
controls the bevel placement around the lens shape. It is
desirable to locate the bevel position equidistant in relation
to the front curve of the lens so as to dispose the lens
thickness on the wearer's side of the frame and thus preserve
the frame's aesthetic quality.Some presently known edging machines rely on mechanical
forces in an attempt to maintain a consistent disposition of
the edging wheel along the front curve of the lens. The
edging wheel face is angled inwardly on either side of the
bevel so that the wheel will be self-centered by the force of
the lens within the angled face of the wheel. It is also
imperative that the edging wheel floats freely in relation to
the lens. However, the response of this relationship is not
truly precise and, as the thickness of the lens increases, the
wheel is no longer able to position itself properly. Other
edging machines attempt to overcome this problem by the use of
patterns or servo-mechanisms which position the edging wheel
either in response to the physical shape of the pattern or to
the stored data which controls the operation of the servo
system. However, present edging machines fail to place the
bevel accurately because they do not use the correct
information in deriving the horizontal displacement of the
edging wheel. These systems use at best two dimensional data
to control a three-dimensional function. Considering the axes
of rotation of the edging wheel and the lens to be aligned in
the X direction and a line normal to those axes and connecting
them to be aligned in the Y direction, present systems 
typically use only Y axis data to determine the X axis
displacement. However, because of the front curvature of the
lens, the X displacement to the point of contact between the
edging wheel and the lens is also a function of a vertical or
Z axis distance taken from the actual point of contact between
the lens and the edging wheel to the X-Y plane.Considering the problem from another vantage point,
present servo-type edging machines can only be accurate if the
lens shape is circular, because the point of contact of the
lens with the edging wheel must then be in the plane described
by the axis of rotation of the lens shape and the center of
rotation of the edging wheel. However, as the lens shape
contorts to fit into fashion
