<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns the use as anti-UV agent, in an elastomer rubber composition, titanium dioxide particles of not more than 20 mn in size, said particles being coated with a silica, silico-aluminate or alumina layer. The invention also concerns rubber compositions comprising such an anti-UV agent and finished products based on said composition.
