Electrical switching device (10), in particular 
a monostable switch, such as a push-button or rocker 

switch, having a housing (12), having a hand operating 
element (14) arranged thereon for acting on at least one 

contact arrangement (20) which is located in the housing 
(12), in each case comprising at least one moving contact 

piece (32) and one fixed contact piece (35, 36), characterized 
in that the at least one moving contact piece 

(32) is designed as a contact rocker having two contact 
arms (33, 34) which are arranged on the same side and 

interact with fixed contact pieces (35, 36) which are 
arranged opposite one another, and in that the housing 

(12) has a handle recess (16) which is provided with a 
drain opening (18). 
Electrical switching device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the housing (12) has a region (24) 

which is surrounded by a rim (22) and through which the 
hand operating element (14) passes in order to act on the 

contact arrangement (20). 
Electrical switching device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the hand operating element (14) 

engages over the rim (22) and thus forms an overlapping 
barrier against liquid. 
Electrical switching device according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the drain 

opening (18) in the handle recess (16) is arranged at the 
deepest point, the apex, of said handle recess (16). 
Electrical switching device according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the drain opening (18) is connected 

to a chute (19) which leads to outlet openings arranged 
at the side. 
Electrical switching device according to Claim 4 
or 5, characterized in that the drain opening (18) in the 

handle recess (16) is arranged outside the region (24) 
surrounded by the rim
 (22). 
Electrical switching device according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the fixed  

 
contact pieces (35, 36) are designed as contact tracks 

which are at least partially recessed in the housing 
(12). 
Electrical switching device according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the contact 

rocker (32) is mounted in a floating manner in a contact 
bridge (30). 
Electrical switching device according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the contact 

rocker (32) is acted on by a pressure piece (29), which 
is mounted in a sprung manner by means of a compression 

spring (28) and is guided in the hand operating element 
(14) such that it can be displaced longitudinally. 
Electrical switching device according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that the pressure piece (29) is 

arranged, at right angles to the pivoting axis of the 
hand operating element (14), in a switching part (15). 
Electrical switching device according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the pivoting 

axis of the hand operating element (14) is arranged 
parallel to the tilting axis of the contact rocker (32). 
Electrical switching device according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the hand 

operating element (14) carries out a pivoting movement 
during operation, whose rotation sense is opposite that 

of the pivoting movement of the contact rocker (32). 
Electrical switching device according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the hand 

operating element (14) is provided with an illumination 
device (26), which is used for back-illumination of at 

least a part of the operating surface of the hand operating 
element (14). 
Electrical switching device according to Claim 
13, characterized in that the illumination device is a 

microlamp. 
Electrical switching device according to Claim 
13, characterized in that the illumination device (26) is 

a light-emitting diode LED. 
Electrical switching device according to one of  
 

Claims 13 to 15, characterized in that the power supply 
for the illumination device (26) is provided via the 

contact rocker (32). 
Electrical switching device according to Claim 
[sic]
 9 and 16, characterized in that the compression 
spring (28) and the pressure piece (29) are designed to 

be electrically conductive and are used as connecting 
conductors for the illumination device (26). 
Electrical switching device according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the illumination 

device (26) is used for back-illumination of a 
marking on the operating surface of the operating 

element. 
Electrical switching device according to Claim
