<ABSTRACT>
A multi-terminal filtered electrical connector 
assembly (10) includes a housing (26,28) having a plurality 

of terminal-receiving passageways (30). A plurality of 
terminals (22) are received in the passageways, with tail 

portions (22a) of the terminals projecting from the housing. 
A terminal alignment plate (16), independent of the 

housing, includes a plurality of through holes (58) for 
receiving and aligning the tail portions of the terminals. 

First complementary interengaging latch devices (70,74,76) 
are provided between the housing and the alignment plate 

for readily assembling the alignment plate on the housing. 
A ferrite block (18) is mountable on the alignment plate 

and includes a plurality of through holes (60) alignable 
with the holes in the alignment plate for receiving therethrough 

the tail portions of the terminals. Second complementary 
interengaging latch devices (62,66) are provided 

between the alignment plate and the ferrite block for readily 
assembling the ferrite block on the alignment plate. 

Therefore, the alignment plate and the ferrite block can be 
assembled as a subassembly about the tail portions of the 

terminals, and the subassembly can be readily assembled to 
the housing. A flexible capacitor filter circuit (20) is 

mounted on a rear face (34) of the housing and through 
which the terminals extend.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a multi-terminal filtered
electrical connector assembly as described in the preamble
of claim 1.An electrical connector assembly of that kind (US-A-4,921,431)
has a shell as a main housing portion and an
adaptor housing for accomodating a slab of ferromagnetic
material through which the tail portions of the terminals
extend. These tail portions may be electrically connected to
one or a plurality of printed circuit boards. Such
electrical connector assembly provides filtering as it can
be done by ferromagnetic material.Electrical circuitry often is used in environments
wherein the circuitry must be protected from disruptions or
"noise" caused by electromagnetic interference (EMI), radio
frequency interference (RFI), electrostatic discharges (ESD)
and/or electromagnetic pulses (EMP). Such applications may
range from use in high frequency pulse circuits, such as
computers, wherein signals are generated which will cause
radio frequency interference and electromagnetic
interference to nearby radio and other electronic devices,
to automotive applications wherein equipment must be
protected against power surges owing to electrostatic
discharges and electromagnetic pulses as well. A high
voltage generated by electrostatic discharges and
electromagnetic pulses can damage voltage sensitive
integrated circuits and the like.One environment wherein such problems have become
prevalent is in the automotive industry wherein electronics,
including computer circuitry, have become common to control,
monitor or otherwise interconnect all kinds of electrical
circuitry within the operative systems of the vehicle. This
invention is directed to such applications, and,
particularly, to a main electrical 
connector assembly which is utilized "under the hood" of an
automobile or other vehicle which employs a multitude of
electrical interconnections. In fact, the connector
disclosed herein may employ as many as eighty terminals.In environments as described above, it is
desirable to provide the connector assembly with a
filtering capability, such as to suppress EMI and RFI, and
transient suppression means to suppress EMP and ESD
interference or other undesirable signals which may exist
in circuits terminated to the connectors. Employing filter
components in a connector assembly creates problems in
manufacture and assembly because of the undue complexity of
the connectors, particularly in substantially increasing
the assembly costs of the connectors. In the extremely
high volume environment of automotive
