<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a cutting element (11) for an extrusion device, the said element having cutter blades mounted in a cantilever fashion in a hub and set at a certain angle of incidence. The cutter blades (12), which are exclusively mounted in cantilever fashion in the hub (14) of the impeller, in this case extend substantially radially from the hub.

<CLAIMS>
Cutting tool for an extrusion machine, particularly for the extrusion of
chemical granules, preferably for detergents, with a mould (10) positioned

in the area of a material discharge orifice and with which is associated the
pivotably mounted cutting tool (11), which is constructed in the manner of

an impeller, in which several knife blades (12) are fitted to a blade holder
(13) located in a hub (14) of the impeller and can be moved on a circular

path on a planar bearing surface (15) of the mould (10), the blades (12)
projecting substantially radially from the hub (14), have a setting angle

(α) and are exclusively mounted and held in cantilevered manner in the hub
(14), characterized in that the blade holder (13) is constructed as a clamping

device for clamping the blades (12), that for the construction of the
blade holder (13) in the hub (14) at an angle corresponding to the setting

angle (α) of the blades (12), bearing surfaces (15) for the blades (12)
are constructed in inclined manner with respect to the rotation plane of the

impeller, that clamping wedges (16) are provided and can be screwed to the
hub (14) in the area of the bearing surfaces (15) and that each knife blade

(12) is clamped between a bearing surface (15) and a clamping wedge (16).
Cutting tool according to claim 1, characterized in that the hub (14)
is shaped like a flat truncated cone.
Cutting tool according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the knife blades (12) are constructed as thin, planar plates.
Cutting tool according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that, in ground plan, the knife blades (12) taper radially outwards.
Cutting tool according to claim 4, characterized in that, in ground plan,
the knife blades (12) are substantially trapezoidal. 
Cutting tool according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the knife blades (12) are constructed elastically in such a way that

in the operating state of the cutting tool they can be bent counter to the
material feed direction under the working load.
Cutting tool according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the setting angle (α) of the knife blades (12) is between 0 and 45°.
Cutting tool according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the knife blades (12) have holes (17) distributed over their surface.
