<DESCRIPTION>
 TRICYCLIC DEFEM SULPHONES AS ELASTASE INHIBITORSThe present invention relates to new cephalosporin sulphones, then- preparation and to pharmaceutical and veterinary compositions containing them. The compounds disclosed in the present invention are tricyclic β-lactam derivatives chai'acterized by a cephem sulfone skeleton fused with a furane, thiophene or pyrrole ring. According to the invention there are provided compounds of formula ( I ) and the pharmaceutically and veterinarily acceptable salt thereof:wherein R -i is hydrogen or halogen or an optionally substituted Ci -Cg alkyl, C2 -C6 alkenyl, C_ -C6 alkoxy, C1 -C6 alkylthio, Cx -C6 acyloxy or Ci -Ce carboxamido group;R2 is hydrogen or an optionally substituted C jj-C alkyl, C 3 -C6 cycloalkyl, C6 -C1 0 aryl or C7 -C1 4 ai-alkyl group;R3 is hydrogen or halogen or an optionally substituted C^ -Cg alkyl, C3 -C6 cycloalkyl, Cy-C. . aralkyl group or an optionally
