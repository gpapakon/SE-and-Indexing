<ABSTRACT>
Described is a resonant-cavity p-i-n photodetector based on the 
reflection or transmission through a Fabry-Perot cavity incorporating non-epitaxial, 

amorphous layers with alternating refractive index difference electron-beam 
deposited on a light-gathering side of a commercially available photodetector. The 

materials of the Fabry-Perot cavity are be selectable from materials refractive indices 
of which fall with a large range (from n=1.26 for CaF₂ to n=3.5 for Si) preferably 

from materials which are depositable in an amorphous state. The material 
combinations are selected so that only wavelengths resonant with the cavity mode 

will be detected. The microcavity of the RC-PIN design can also be deposited on 
any existing detector structure, without modification of semiconductor growth. Such 

a photodetector would be useful for wavelength de-multiplexing applications. The 
ease of layer deposition, as well as the high degree of tailorability of spectral 

position, spectral detection width, and maximum numerical aperture of efficient 
detection, make the RC-PIN attractive for use in wavelength demultiplexing 

applications. An exemplary RC-PIN photodetector includes a Si/SiO₂ Fabry-Perot 
cavity electron-beam deposited on the InP substrate of a commercial InGaAs 

photodetector. The detection efficiency relative to a reference device was 52 percent 
at the resonant wavelength of 1350 nm, with a resonance width of 14 nm, and a 4 

percent response for off-resonance wavelengths in the 1100-1700 nm range.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns photodetectors with a resonant cavity. Wavelength selective detectors are useful in wavelength-division 
multiplexing applications. By sending separate signals at different wavelengths 
through an optical fiber, and detecting these wavelengths separately, one can 
increase the information capacity of a communications system. The light sources 
could consist of semiconductor lasers or narrow-spectrum light emitting diodes 
(LEDs) such as a resonant cavity LED (RCLED). The detection system must be able 
to demultiplex the signal, i.e., detect the different wavelength signals separately. 
Each detector in the demultiplexing scheme must be able to detect the light from its 
design wavelength with good efficiency, while being insensitive to all other 
wavelengths in order to minimize cross-talk between channels. Recently, resonant cavity enhanced (RCE) photodetectors have been 
studied for use in wavelength-division multiplexing applications. These designs 
place the absorbing region of a photodetector within a Fabry-Perot resonant cavity 
consisting of epitaxial semiconductor layers. Such devices can exhibit high speed, 
can have thin absorption regions, and detect light most strongly at the resonant 
wavelength of the cavity while reflecting non-resonant wavelengths. These devices, 
however, require the growth of a thick epitaxial distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) 
semiconductor mirror below and usually above the active region. For example, see 
K. Kishino et al., "Resonant Cavity - Enhanced (RCE) Photodetectors", IEEE 
Journal of Quantum Electronics, Vol. 27, No. 8, August 1991, pages 2025-2034. This invention is a resonant-cavity p-i-n photodetector based on the 
reflection or transmission through a Fabry-Perot cavity incorporating non-epitaxial, 
amorphous layers with alternating refractive index difference electron-beam 
deposited on a light-gathering side of a commercially available photodetector. The 
materials of the Fabry-Perot cavity are selectable from materials refractive indices of 
which fall within a large range (from n=1.26 for CaF2 to n=3.5 for Si) preferably 
from materials which when deposted are in an amorphous state. The material 
combinations are selected so that only wavelengths resonant with the cavity mode 
will be detected. The microcavity of the RC-PIN design can be deposited by 
electron beam evaporation on any existing detector structure, without modification of 
semiconductor growth. Such a photodetector would be useful for wavelength  
 
demultiplexing
