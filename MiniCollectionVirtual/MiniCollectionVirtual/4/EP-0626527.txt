<ABSTRACT>
The control (6) serves for controlling an automatic gear mechanism, a wheel-slip controller, a rear-wheel steering mechanism, a driving-speed controller, etc. In dependence on the accelerator-pedal position, on the driving speeds and, if appropriate, on further sensor signals, a manipulated variable ("gear") for the device to be controlled is determined. The control (6) has a fuzzy logic (23) with at least one control base (29), which, by evaluating driving parameters, produces an output variable ("road type") which indicates the type of road driven on and which is used in order to establish the manipulated variable.

Controller (6) for an automatic gearbox (5) in a
motor vehicle, by means of which a manipulated variable

for controlling the transmission ratio (gear) of the
gearbox (5) is defined as a function of driving parameters

such as the accelerator pedal position (dK) and
the speed of the vehicle and, if appropriate, further

measured variables, the controller (6) having a fuzzy
logic system (23) which is provided with at least one

control base and by means of which an output variable
which characterizes the type of road travelled on and a

plurality of output variables which characterize the
variation in the road travelled on as well as the traffic

flow (road type; x-, y-, z-dynamics) are generated by
means of an evaluation of the driving parameters, with

which output variables a characteristic diagram which is
used in defining the transmission ratio (gear) of the

gearbox is selected in a control characteristic diagram
selector (26).
Controller (6) according to Claim 1, characterized
in that it has a signal conditioning circuit (22) by

means of which a signal (N
ab
) which corresponds to the
vehicle speed is averaged (N
ab_
average) over a prescribed
time period and is used in a first control base (RB road)

during the determination of a first output variable which
characterizes the type of road travelled on (road type).
Controller (6) according to Claim 1, characterized
in that it has a signal conditioning circuit (22) by

means of which an average value is formed over a
prescribed time period (z) by a signal (Br) which 

indicates a braking procedure, and this average value is
used to determine the first output variable which characterizes

the type of road travelled on (road type).
Controller (6) according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the fuzzy logic system (23) has a second

control base (RB-x dynamics), by means of which a second
output variable (x dynamics) is produced, which contains

an information item relating to the traffic flow on the
road travelled on.
Controller (6) according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the fuzzy logic system (23) has a third

control base (RB-y dynamics), by means of which a third
output variable (y dynamics) is produced, which contains

an information item relating to the frequency of bends in
the road travelled on.
Controller (6) according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the fuzzy logic system (23) has a fourth

control base (RB-z dynamics), by means of which a fourth
output variable (z dynamics) is produced, which contains

an information item relating to the frequency of
gradients in the road travelled on.
Controller (6) according to Claim 1, characterized
in that time-based average values or changes in

signals (dK, ay, ddK) which represent operating states of
the motor vehicle 
or accelerator pedal activations are
evaluated by the fuzzy logic system (23) and are used to

control the transmission ratio of a motor vehicle
gearbox.
Controller (6) according to Claim 1, characterized
in that it has a signal conditioning circuit (22) by

means of which a signal (ddK), which represents the
accelerator pedal position or throttle valve position, is

averaged over a prescribed time period (z) and is used to
detect the type of road travelled on (road type).
Controller (6) according to Claim 7, characterized
in that it has a signal conditioning circuit (22) by

means of which an average value (ay_average) of the
absolute value of a signal (ay) which corresponds to the 

lateral acceleration of the motor vehicle is formed over
a prescribed time period, and this average value is used

in the fuzzy control base (29) to determine the first
output variable (road type) and the third output variable

(y dynamics).
