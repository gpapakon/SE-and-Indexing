<ABSTRACT>
Softness retention characteristics of raisins are improved by applying to the surface of the raisins a pure edible polyalcohol humectant, preferably glycerol, at a rate of 20-28 % based on the weight of the raisins. The raisins and humectant are then tempered by immersing the raisins and humectant in additional humectant solution at a temperature of 90-100  F (32-44  C) for a time efficient to enable the raisins to absorb the humectant to an amount of about 10-19 % by weight. The raisins are then removed from the humectant solution and thereafter dried to a moisture content of 7-20 %.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR INFUSING RAISINS WITH HIGH LEVELSOF HUMECTANT Field of the Invention This invention relates to methods for attaining and preserving the softness of dried fruits to be stored in isolation or in combination with other food products such as cake mixes and similar flour-based products and, in particular, dry ready-to-eat cereal breakfast foods. More particularly, this invention relates to methods for infusing relatively large amounts of humectants, particularly glycerol, into raisins intended to be formulated in combination with dry ready to eat breakfast foods. Background of the Invention Fresh raisins and other dried fruits, even when sealed in waxed paper and foil within paperboard containers, progressively lose their softness and became hard, presumably because of moisture losses and chemical changes. The loss of softness or tenderness becomes more pronounced when the raisins are packed with dry food products, such as toasted bran or corn flakes, which have a low moisture content relative to the raisins. In order to prevent rapid loss of moisture from the raisins to the cereal, it previously has been necessary to increase the moisture content of the cereal prior to packaging with raisins. The addition of moisture to the cereal, however, causes a substantial loss of crispness, which is undesirable in many such products.An alternative method of keeping raisins soft is to employ an edible humectant, such as glycerol. However, the simple topical application of a humectant to a dried fruit, such as raisins, having a relatively tough outer skin does not reliably increase the softness retention characteristics of the fruit under storage conditions, and the fruit will absorb only small amounts of the humectant through the skin. Moreover, any improvement in softness retention resulting from the initial incorporation of a high level of moisture into the fruit is quickly lost during conventional storage. 

 There are various known methods which involved the treatment of raisins and other dried fruits which involve infusion of edible humectants into said fruits. These methods suffer from one or more disadvantages, including the necessity of a pretreatment step using acids, alkalis, surfactants, and similar additives which necessitate one or more specific removal steps. In other methods of infusion, the total amount of humectant which can possibly be added to raisins is generally below 10% by weight. Still other methods permit the infusion of higher levels of humectant but these methods generally suffer

<CLAIMS>
We claim;
1. A method of improving softness retention characteristics of raisins which comprises the steps of: providing raisins with a moisture content of from about 18 to about 26%, applying to the surface of said raisins pure edible polyalcohol humectant at a temperature of from about 150°F to 190°F in an amount of from about 20 to about 28 percent based on the weight of the raisins, tempering the raisins and the humectant in a bin at a temperature of from about 90°F to about 110°F with sufficient additional humectant solution to ensure that said raisins are completely immersed, for sufficient time to enable the raisins to absorb said humectant to an amount of from about 10% to about 19% by weight; separating the raisins from the used humectant solution; and thereafter drying the raisins to a moisture content of from about 7% to about 20%.
2. A method according to claim 1 in which the edible polyalcohol humectant is selected from the group consisting of glycerol, sorbitol, propylene glycol, mannitol -and mixtures thereof. 3. A method according to claim 2 in which the edible polyalcohol humectant is glycerol or a mixture of glycerol and sorbitol.
4. A method according to claim 3 in which the edible polyalcohol humectant is glycerol. 5. A method according to claim 3 in which the raisins are first hydrated with water at a temperature of from 160 to 190° for sufficient time to attain the moisture content of from about 18 to about 26%.
6. A method according to claim 5 in which the raisins are hydrated at a temperature of from 170° to 180° to attain a moisture content of from 20 to 24%.
7. A method according to claim 5 in which the hydration time is from about 60 seconds to about 90 seconds.
