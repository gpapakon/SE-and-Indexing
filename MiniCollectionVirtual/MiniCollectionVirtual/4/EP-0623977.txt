plurality of electronic components such as TV's, VCR's, AM/FM 

tuners, speakers, etc., to a common power source, e.g., AC, 
which includes a input module (15) adapted for being directly 

coupled to the power source, a junction module (19) for being

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to cabling assemblies for electrically 
coupling various electronic components, e.g., televisions 
(TV's), video cassette recorders (VCR's), amplifiers, etc., to a 
suitable power source, e.g., AC. The invention is thus 
particularly related to the home entertainment field, but, as 
defined, has even broader applicability to other systems wherein 
various electronic components require coupling. In today's environment, many consumers possess and utilize a 
variety of home entertainment products, including, e.g., 
computers, televisions, VCR's, AM/FM tuners and amplifiers, 
phonographs, etc. Such products will be referred to herein as 
electronic components. Typically, these components are located 
in close proximity to one another, e.g., within the consumer's 
home, and are coupled to an associated power source, e.g., 
normal AC line current. Because each such component also 
typically requires more than one input and output means, e.g., 
electrical wiring, antenna leads ( TV's, tuners) and cable leads 
(TV's)), the positioning of several such components in close 
proximity can present a potential problem with respect to both 
appearance and safety. In U.S. Patent 4,337,480 (Bourassin et al), there is described 
an interconnection system which is designed to interconnect a TV 
receiver to a plurality of peripheral devices such as video 
games, teletext receivers, etc., the system utilizing a 
plurality of control stages associated with the devices, a 
corresponding plurality of electronic switches and a 
microprocessor, all working in unison with a remote control  
 
system to generate and transmit the needed commands to the 
system. Such as system appears relatively complex and thus 
costly to the average consumer. In U.S. Patent 4,602,164 (Gore 
et al), there is described a system for packaging and grounding 
various electronic devices such as personal computers, the 
system primarily designed to provide EMI shielding and requiring 
use of an electrical interface coupled to the various devices 
using individual wiring or the like. This system provides such 
protection through use of an electrically conductive housing 
containing the interfacing, main processing unit (MPU), but, as 
indicated, appears to require separate wiring to couple the MPU 
to the individual external devices. In 4,974,121 (Masuko et al), 
there is described a "wiring module" to electrically 
interconnect various electrical parts all located on a common 
equipment frame, this "module" essentially consisting of
