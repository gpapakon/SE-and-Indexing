<ABSTRACT>
The lift serves to install and remove vehicle parts and is provided with a carrying frame (1) which, at both ends of a telescopically extendable carrying rail (8, 18), has supporting brackets (7) with supporting feet (5, 6), by means of which it can be supported on the edges of an engine-compartment aperture (2) of the vehicle body. It is provided with two lifting devices (10) individually guided in a displaceable manner on the carrying frame (1). The lifting devices (10) each have a lifting member (12) lowerable and liftable by rotary actuation and remaining in its position by self-locking. The carrying frame (1) consists of two telescopically extendable carrying rails (8, 8', 18, 18') which run at a lateral distance apart in parallel to one another and on which the lifting devices (10) are guided in a positive-locking manner by means of guide tubes (11). The lifting devices (10) each have a flexible tension member (12) which is passed through between the carrying rails (8, 8', 18, 18') and can be actuated by means of worm gearing (19), self-locking in the tension direction, of the lifting device (10).

Lift bridge for the installation and the removal of 
vehicle parts with a support frame (1), which at both ends of a 

telescopically extensible support rail (8, 18) comprises support 
plates (7) with support feet (5, 6), by which it can be supported 

against the edges of an engine compartment opening (43) in the 
bodywork and with two lifting devices (10) guided to slide 

individually on the support frame (8, 18), which each comprise 
a lifting member (12), which is able to be raised and lowered by 

rotary actuation and remains in its position due to self-locking, 
characterised in that the support frame (1) consists of two 

telescopically extensible support rails (8, 8', 18, 18') 
extending parallel to each other with a lateral spacing, on which 

the lifting devices (10) are guided in a form-locking manner by 
means of guide tubes (11) and that the lifting devices (10) 

comprise a flexible pulling member (12) guided through 
respectively between the support rails (8, 8', 18, 18'), which 

pulling member can be actuated by means of a worm drive (19) of 
the lifting device (10), which worm drive is self-locking in the 

pulling direction. 
Lift bridge according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the worm drive (31) consists of a worm (22) able to rotate about 

a vertical axis (22') and a worm wheel (28) able to rotate about 
a horizontal axis (26), which are mounted in a closed housing 

(43), and that the worm (22) is provided with a wrench head (24) 
projecting from the housing (43) on the upper side. 
Lift bridge according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterised 
in that the worm wheel (28) is connected to a chain wheel (21) 

and that the flexible pulling member (12) is a link chain (12) 
meshing positively with the chain wheel (21). 
Lift bridge according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that an approximately semi-circular chain guide 

(29) is located in the housing (43) above the chain wheel (21).  
 
Lift bridge according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the support plates (7) rigidly connected 

to the free ends of the two support rails (8, 8', 18, 18') are 
mounted resepctively by means of pendulum articulations (15), 

which are coaxial with each other, on substantially vertical 
support legs (6) to swing about a substantially horizontal 

pendulum axis (15'). 
Lift bridge according to Claim 1 or 5, characterised in 
that the lower ends of the support legs (6) are provided with 

support feet (5), which are adjustable in each case about 
substantially vertical swivel axes (17) of the support legs (6). 
Lift bridge according to Claim 6, characterised in that 
the support feet (5) comprise downwardly directed projections 

(27) arranged respectively asymmetrically with respect to the 
swivel axes (17), which projections (27) are provided with soft 

non-slip shoes (20). 
Lift bridge according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the two support rails (8, 8', 18, 18') 

consist respectively of rectangular, in particular square tubes 
guided to slide one in the other, which are attached to the 

support plates (7) so that respectively one of their diametral 
planes (32) extends at least approximately vertically in the 

position of use.
