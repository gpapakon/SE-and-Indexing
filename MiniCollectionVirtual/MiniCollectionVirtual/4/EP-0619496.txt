<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic field sensor is provided in which plane polarised light at first 
and second wavelengths is admitted into a block (2) of material 

exhibiting the Faraday effect. The light undergoes rotation of its plane of 
polarisation in the presence of a magnetic field. The angle of rotation of 

the plane of polarisation is proportional to the strength of the magnetic 

field, and is a function of wavelength of the light. The light emerging 
from the block (2) is analysed to determine the amount of rotation 

experienced by each wavelength. Inclusion of an output polariser (24) 
results in a sensor in which the light leaving the sensor is colour 

encoded as a function of magnetic field.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic field sensor. Some types of known magnetic field sensors employ electrical sensors to 
measure magnetic fields. In environments where high voltages and/or 
large electric field gradients are encountered, such as in power 
distribution systems, it may be desirable to use a sensor that is not 
connected via electrically conductive means to data processing or 
recording equipment. EP-B-0 081 367 discloses a magnetic field sensor where the Faraday 
effect is used to intensity modulate light passing through a Faraday cell. 
The light intensity is detected by a photodetector. When the angle 
between the polariser and the analyser is set at 45°, the output of a 
photodetector is given by: 
Vout = 1/2 . K . (1 + sin 2ϑ) where:
 
K is a constant determined by the intensity of the light and the sensitivity 
of the photodetector; and
 
ϑ is the angle of rotation of the plane of polarisation.  Thus the output is periodic with changes in magnetic field, since the 
angle of rotation ϑ is proportional to magnetic field. Consequently the 
sensitivity of such an arrangement falls as the output approaches the 
maxima and minima of the response. In order to achieve substantially 
linear operation, the variation in ϑ must be kept small. SU 757 990 describes a device in which light from a laser is directed 
around a Faraday cell encircling an electrical conductor. The amount of 
rotation of the plane of polarisation is measured to determine the current 
through the electrical conductor. NL 8700 697 A describes a similar arrangement in which a substantially 
rectangular Faraday cell encircles an electrical conductor. Light enters 
and exits the cell at a single corner to minimise the effects of stray 
magnetic fields. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a 
magnetic field sensor, comprising a source of plane polarised radiation 
having at least first and second wavelengths; an optical element of a 
material exhibiting the Faraday effect, the optical element having an 
input surface and an output surface; and an analyser for measuring an 
amount by which the plane of polarisation of the first wavelength is 
rotated and for measuring an amount by which the plane of polarisation 
of the second wavelength is rotated, the radiation being arranged to enter 
the optical element perpendicular to the input surface and to exit the 
optical element at the output surface. The amount of rotation experienced by the radiation is a function of 
magnetic field
