<ABSTRACT>
The cover plate for white goods, which is the object of 
this invention, is formed by a frame (1, 2, 3) inside which 

a rectangular or square panel (4) is blocked. 
The frame comprises four vertical lateral walls (1) having 
a horizontal upper edge (2) which blocks the panel (4) 

inside the frame (1, 2, 3) when the plastic material which 
forms the frame (1, 2, 3) has shrunk to its final size, 

said frame being removed from the injection moulding press 
when it is still hot. The frame comprises also a horizontal 

plane (3) which connects to each other the vertical lateral 
walls (1) of the frame (1, 2, 3), and which supports the 

panel (4). 
The method comprises a step in which the frame (1, 2, 3) is 
removed from the press by means of a robot-manipulator 

which places it on a plane. A second robot-manipulator 
inserts the panel (4) inside the frame and said panel 

remains blocked in the latter after shrinking of the 
material which forms the frame (1, 2, 3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing a 
cover plate for white goods, and particularly to a method 
which takes advantage of the shrinking property of the 
plastic material which forms the frame of the cover plate, 
in order to fit a decorative sight-exposed panel inside 
said frame. Several methods are known for realizing covers for white 
goods, in which said covers are formed by a frame and a 
counterframe made up by a plurality of strips which are 
fitted to the sides of the frame. The way in which the 
strips are fitted to the frame is rather complicated. According to a method provided by the applicant for 
producing a cover of the aforesaid kind, various steps are 
required, that is: the seizing - by means of a robot or 
mechanical hand - of the frame, which is still warm, from 
the automatic press, the rotation of the frame by a 
predetermined angle, performed by the mechanical hand, the 
turning over of the frame by an angle of 180° through a 
tilter or manipulator, the insertion of the panel inside 
the frame, and the fitting of the strips to the frame 
itself in order to block the panel; in order to fix the 
strips more properly in the ensemble formed by the frame 
and the counterframe, a station is provided in which 
needles are introduced through the fins of the strips, 
until they penetrate into the panel. Furthermore, in order 
to facilitate the fitting of the strips on the sides of the  
 
frame, a forming station is provided, for the forming of 
the lateral walls of every side of the frame. This method, like other conventional methods, as for 
example the fixing of the panel to the frame by means of 
adhesives, are rather complicated, and in some cases they 
cause problems due to scrapping of the rejections and to 
pollution caused by the use of adhesives. Moreover this 
scrap is not recoverable because the worked materials, once 
they have been gluid together, cannot be separated. Another object of the present invention is that of 
realizing a cover plate for white goods which comprises 
only a frame (without counter-frame) and a panel, said 
frame being able to block in a non-removable way, the panel 
which had been inserted inside it, due to shrinking of the 
plastic material by which it is formed, so that there will 
be no need of strips or centering teeth on the internal 
side walls of the frame. Moreover, since the cover plate is 
tray-like and monolithic, it is closed at the bottom and 
therefore it is perfectly sealed. Therefore, since the 
strips are no more

<CLAIMS>
A method for producing a cover plate for white goods, 
characterized in that it comprises the following steps: 


removal of the frame of the cover plate from the 
injection moulding automatic press by means of a first 

robot-manipulator, and arrangement of said plastic frame 
on a working table; 
arrangement of a panel (4) between the sides of the 
frame (1, 2, 3) and on a horizontal plane (3) connecting 

the lateral vertical walls (1) of the frame, by means of 
a second robot-manipulator, on the side of said 

horizontal plane (3) in which the vertical walls (1) of 
the frame form a horizontal edge (2); 
waiting period, until said horizontal edge (2) of the 
frame, due to shrinking of the material forming the 

frame (1, 2, 3), is superimposed to the edge of the 
panel (4) on the opposite side of it with respect to the 

horizontal plane (3) and the vertical lateral walls (1) 
of the frame touch the edge of the panel, permanently 

blocking the latter inside the frame (1, 2, 3). 
A method for producing a cover plate for white goods, 
characterized in that said first robot-manipulator 

carries out a rotation of a predetermined angle of its 
mechanical hand, preferably of 90°, in order to place 

said plastic frame on a horizontal working table and to 
allow the second robot-manipulator to insert the panel 

 
inside the frame. 
A cover plate for white goods, produced according to the 
method of claims 1 and 2, characterized in that it 

comprises a frame and a panel (4), said frame being 
rectangular or square and comprising four vertical 

lateral walls (1), a horizontal edge (2) at the upper 
end of said vertical walls (1) which is superimposed to 

the edge of the panel (4) blocked inside the frame, and 
a horizontal supporting plane (3) for the panel (4), 

which connects to each other the four vertical lateral 
walls (1) of the frame, at a point located substantially 

in the middle between the two ends of said lateral 
vertical walls (1). 
A cover plate for white goods according to claim 3, 
characterized in that the horizontal edge (2) of the 

frame is discontinuous.
