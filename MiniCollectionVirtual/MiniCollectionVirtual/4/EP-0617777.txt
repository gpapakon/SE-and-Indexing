<ABSTRACT>
A pipe stopper (1) comprises an elongate resilient body member, sealing means arranged circumferentially (5, 6) of the body member and guide means to assist in guiding the stopper around a bend and/or an elbow in a pipe. The stopper may be part of a stopper system which provides means for placing a stopper at a distance remote from an access point and means (2) for subsequently retrieving the stopper.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stopper kit
adapted to effect a seal within a fluid-carrying
pipe.In the maintenance or renewal of domestic low pressure gas
supply systems it is frequently necessary to cut off the gas
supply temporarily at a distance remote from the access point,
to allow such maintenance or renewal to be carried out.
Typically such a requirement arises, for example, when
exchanging or repairing a meter control cock, or an elbow,
under "live" conditions, or when stopping off a gas supply at
a point outside the consumer's premises. In some circumstances
it is also necessary to cut off the gas supply from a premises
for an extended period, for example, if the gas supply is to
be withdrawn from a consumer for some reason.It has previously been proposed to insert into the pipe
a hollow tube having at one end an inflatable sack which is
pushed down the pipe in a deflated condition and then inflated
to block the pipe. However, with such a device it is still
necessary for the inflation tube to remain in position, and
this is often an inconvenience when carrying out repair work.
There is therefore a continuing requirement for a system which
will enable a pipe to be blocked at a distance remote from the 
access point without leaving any part or fitting in the
pipe protruding from or interfering with the access
point.In addition to the above requirement, the point at
which it is required to block the pipe is often beyond
one or more pipe bends or elbows, and therefore desirably
any blocking system should be able to negotiate at least
one, and preferably two or more such bends or elbows.In certain circumstances an improvement in the
sealing capability of the known blocking system would
also be desirable. For example, a public utility now
requires that a seal for a domestic gas pipe should be
able to withstand a pressure of up to 100 millibars for
a minimum of 5 minutes with a maximum pressure loss of 1%
over that time, and this is difficult to achieve with
existing blocking methods.EP 0 497 043,
which is a document according to Art.54(3) EPC, discloses a pipe block comprising a
body having a shaft and a plurality of spaced-part
annular flanges extending from the shaft to form a close
fit with the internal wall of the pipe. A funnel serves
to guide the threaded end of an insertion rod into a
threaded bore in the pipe block, but does not serve to
assist in guiding the pipe block around a bend and/or
elbow in the pipe.GB 2 236 158,
which is considered to be the closest prior art, discloses a seal for a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A stopper kit adapted to block a pipe (112) at a
point remote from an access point thereof which comprises

a stopper (1,101) adapted to be an interference fit
within the pipe and to be moved along the pipe from the

access point to the remote point, a placement means (26-33;
303-306) adapted to move the stopper along the pipe from the

access point to the remote point, a retrieval means (34-38)
adapted to move the stopper means from the remote

point to the access point, the stopper and the retrieval
means being provided with co-operating engagement means

(26,22) so arranged that on engagement the stopper can be
moved by the retrieval means from the remote point to the

access point,

   characterised in that the co-operating engagement
means comprises a collet (22) adapted to co-operate with

a docking sleeve (26,303), and in that a strain wire (33) in
the placement means is adapted to retract the docking

sleeve (26,303) from the collet thereby enabling the placement
means to be detached from the stopper.
A stopper kit according to claim 1, characterised in
that the placement means comprises an elongate coil

spring (32).
A stopper kit according to claim 2, characterised in
that the strain wire increases the tensile strength of

the coil spring whilst allowing continued flexibility.
A stopper kit according to claim 3, characterised in
that the strain wire extends along the inside of the coil

spring.
A stopper kit according to any of claims 2 to 4,
characterised in that the coil spring is provided with a

sheath (307) applied thereover. 
A stopper kit according to claim 5, characterised in
that the sheath comprises a further coil spring (307)

wound with a helix of opposite turn to that of the coil
spring of the placement means.
A stopper kit according to any preceding claim,
characterised in that the retrieval means

and the placement means comprise the same part.
A stopper kit according to any preceding claim,
characterised in that the stopper comprises an elongate

resilient body member (3,101), sealing means
(5,6,109,110) arranged circumferentially of the body

member and guide means (9,107,301) to assist in guiding
the stopper around a bend an/or an elbow in the pipe.
A stopper kit according to claim 8, characterised in
that the sealing means comprises a plurality of

circumferential flanges (108) arranged along the length
of the body member which are an interference fit in the

pipe.
A stopper kit according to claim 9, characterised in
that the sealing means further comprises a sealing washer

(109), the washer having a flexible circumferential edge
region which provides a relatively low resistance to

insertion of the stopper in the pipe, but which, when the
stopper is pulled back a short distance, is deformed or

folded into engagement with the flange and the internal
wall of the pipe so as to form a seal.
A stopper kit according to claim 10, characterised
in that a trailing face of the sealing washer is provided

with a sealing compound (110) on at least the flexible
circumferential edge region thereof. 
A stopper kit according to any of claims 8 to 11,
characterised in that the body member has resilient

reinforcing means comprising a resilient coil spring
(102).
A stopper kit according to claim 12, characterised
in that the coil-spring is embedded in the wall of the

body member.
A stopper kit according to any of claims 8 to 13,
characterised in that the guide means comprises a

flexible spring (106) provided with an end cap (107).
A stopper kit according to any of claims 8 to 13,
characterised in that the guide means comprises a guide

disc (301), mounted on the leading end of the stopper.
