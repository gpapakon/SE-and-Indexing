<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a golf ball 
having excellent shot feel, control properties 

and flying performance. The golf ball has a 
core and a cover for coating the core. A base 

resin of the cover comprises a mixture of the 
two resins, (A) (B). The Shore D-scale hardness 

and a stiffness of the cover are in the range of 
40 to 55 and 130 to 300 MPa, respectively. 

Resin (A) is an ionomer resin obtained by 
neutralizing at least a part of carboxyl groups 

in a copolymer of an α-olefin and an α, 
β-unsaturated carboxylic acid with a metal ion 

or a mixture thereof. Resin (B) is a 
low-hardness copolymer resin comprising an 

α-olefin, an α, β-unsaturated carboxylic 
acid ester and a polymerizable monomer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a golf ball.
More particularly, it relates to a golf ball having
excellent shot feel control properties and flying
performance.Recently, an ionomer resin has been used as the
base resin for the cover of the golf ball (e.g. Japanese
Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 49-49727). Particularly,
the ionomer resin is exclusively used in two-piece golf
balls which have solid cores.This is because ionomer resin is superior in
durability, cut resistance and impact resilience and,
further, it is easily processed and inexpensive in
comparison with other base resins which may be used for the cover.However, the ionomer resin is inferior in shot
feel and control properties (ease of putting spin on the
ball) in comparison with a balata cover used as the base
resin for the cover of thread wound golf balls since the
ionomer resin has considerably high hardness and stiffness.Therefore, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication
No. 1-308577 suggests to soften a high-rigid ionomer resin
to improve shot feel and control properties by blending 
(mixing) a soft ionomer resin comprising a sodium or zinc
salt of a terpolymer of an α-olefin, an unsaturated
monocarboxylic acid having 3 to 8 carbon atoms and an
unsaturated monomer of an acrylate ester having 2 to 22
carbon atoms with the high-rigid ionomer resin.However, even if the soft ionomer resin as
described above is blended golf balls are still not obtained
which have similar shot feel to golf balls with a balata
cover.The balata cover is characterized by the fact
that stiffness is comparatively high in spite of it's
considerably low hardness, which enables golf balls with
a balata cover to have excellent control properties and
shot feel.However, in the method of blending the soft
ionomer resin described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Publication No. 1-308577, when trying to obtain the
hardness similar to that of the balata cover is made, the
stiffness becomes either too low or too high in comparison
with the balata cover.In both cases, shot feel of the resulting golf
ball is quite different from that of the golf balls with a
balata cover. In addition to the above suggestion, various
trials of softening the ionomer resin to improve the shot
and control properties have been made. However,
satisfactory results have not been obtained.As described above, golf balls with a
ionomer resin cover are inferior in shot feel and control
properties in comparison with the thread wound golf balls
with a balata cover because the ionomer resin has high
hardness and
