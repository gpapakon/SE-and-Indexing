<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to processes and 
apparatus for mixing oxidizable reactants with oxidant 

and/or oxidizing oxidizable reactants. Through using 
particular mixing and/or oxidizing arrangements, the 

risk of flammable or explosive reactions can be 
significantly reduced or prevented. When ammonia is 

used as the reactant, nitric acid can be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes and 
apparatus for mixing oxidizable reactants with oxidant 
and/or oxidizing oxidizable reactants. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to 
processes and apparatus for mixing ammonia with 
oxidant, oxidizing ammonia and forming nitric acid. The vapor phase oxidation is known to be useful 
for producing, inter alia, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, 
formaldehyde, maleic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, 
hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen peroxide, phenol and nitric 
acid. Conventionally, it is carried out with air in 
the presence of oxidation catalysts. Depending on the 
type of oxidizable reactants involved, reaction 
conditions may be varied to increase the desired 
product. Those reaction conditions are well known to 
one of ordinary skill in the art. The oxidation of 
ammonia, for example, is usually carried out at high 
temperature, with a short residence time, in order to 
maximize the formation of nitrogen oxide without the 
formation of undesired products, such as nitrogen. 
Through manipulating the temperature and pressure 
involved, the nitrogen oxide formed can be further 
oxidized to the desired nitrogen dioxide and/or to its 
dimer (NO₂)₂, which are capable of being converted into 
nitric acid by absorption in water. The above conventional oxidation process, 
however, is inefficient due to using a low amount of 
an oxidizable reactant and/or an excessive amount of 
nitrogen. A low concentration of the reactant, for  
 
example, is usually maintained in air due to the 
flammability limit of a reactant-air mixture. The use 
of this low concentration of the reactant, of course, 
reduces the yield of the desired product. Similarly, 
the presence of an excessive amount of nitrogen which 
is present in air reduces the production rate of the 
desired product since a large volume of nitrogen, which 
is not one of the reactants in the process, takes up 
much needed capacity or space in an oxidation process 
system. To mitigate the shortcomings in this 
conventional oxidation process, the use of oxygen 
enriched air or free oxygen to oxidize the oxidizable 
reactant has been proposed, for example, in U.S. Patent 
No. 3,927,182 - Powell. By increasing the 
concentration of oxygen in the oxidizing source, the 
quantity of nitrogen processed or introduced into an 
oxidation reactor system is substantially reduced. 
Such a reduction in nitrogen, of course, can increase 
the capacity of a given oxidation system since a 
greater amount of a reactant can be
