<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates to organopolysiloxane
compositions such as are used for imparting non-tackiness,
water repellency, lubricity and wear resistance to rubber
surfaces. In particular aspects it relates to
organopolysiloxane compositions for use in surface treatment
of rubber to form durably wear-resistant coatings thereon.
It also relates to the preparation and use of such
compositions, and to rubber articles having coatings formed
from such compositions.Inert silicone oil and various curable
organopolysiloxane compositions have been used
for imparting non-tackiness and water
repellency to rubber surface.The inert silicone oil has high initial
wear properties, but does not last long since it
is readily shed from the substrate surface by
physical action as weak as water washing.  The curable organopolysiloxane
compositions used heretofore are typically those
containing a both end hydroxyl - blocked
diorganopolysiloxane, a Si - H group - containing
organopolysiloxane and/or an organoalkoxysilane,
and an organic tin compound. These compositions
form on the substrate surface coatings which are
acceptably tack-free and water repellent, but
poor in lubricity and wear resistance. It is
possible to improve adhesiveness with a
substrate, lubricity and wear resistance by
adding a mixture or reaction product of an
organopolysiloxane having an epoxy group such as
glycidoxy group and epoxycyclohexyl group and
alkoxysilane or siloxane having an amino group
(Japan JP-B Nos. 54-43023, 56-19813 and
56-47864), but the improvement is not yet fully
attained. It is also possible to improve
lubricity and wear resistance by adding inert
silicone to such organopolysiloxane compositions
(Japan JP-B No. 4-80072), but the coatings
are not satisfactorily durably wear resistant
where frictional forces are repeatedly applied.
There is a strong desire for improving coatings
to be durably wear resistant. EP-A-482480 describes organopolysiloxane
compositions for surface coating on EPDM articles. The
composition comprises
(A) an organopolysiloxane including epoxy-containing
substituents, and optionally also terminal
hydroxy groups, with a degree of polymerisation n from 10
to 5000;(C) an organohydrogenpolysiloxane in order to
condense with hydroxy groups of component (A);(D) an alkoxysilane having alkoxy groups and also
mercapto group bonded to silicon via a carbon atom;(E) an alkoxysilane having alkoxy groups and an
amino group bonded to silicon through at least one carbon
atom, and(F) a metal salt of a fatty acid as
