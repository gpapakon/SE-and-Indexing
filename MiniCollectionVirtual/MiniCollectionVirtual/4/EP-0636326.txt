<ABSTRACT>
A process for the treatment of human head hair (19) with a liquid, a sealing device (2) running around the head (6) with a rubber-like seal (4) of a treatment device (1) preventing the liquid from running off the hair (19) into the face and neck region in an uncontrolled manner, provision being made according to the invention for the seal (4) firstly to be widened by stretching and then at least partially relieved for placing the seal (4) against the head (6), and for the seal (4) firstly to be widened by stretching and then relieved for removing the seal (4) from the head (6). As a device (1) for the treatment of human head hair (19) with a liquid, a sealing device (2) running around the head (6) with a rubber-like seal (4) preventing the liquid from running off the hair (19) into the face and neck region in an uncontrolled manner, provision is made according to the invention for the seal (4) to be held in a frame (7) for stretching movements and to be provided with a stretching device (5, 5.1).

A method of cosmetically treating human head hair with a liquid, 
wherein a sealing arrangement of treatment apparatus prevents 

an uncontrolled flow of liquid from the hair to the face and neck, 
the sealing arrangement having a rubber-type seal and extending 

round the head, characterised in that, to place the seal (4) on the 
head (6), the seal (4) is first enlarged by stretching using a 

stretching device and then at least partially relaxed, and in that, to 
remove the seal (4) from the head (6), the seal (4) is first enlarged 

by stretching using a stretching device and then relaxed. 
Apparatus for treating human head hair with a liquid, wherein a 
sealing arrangement having a rubber-type seal and extending 

round the head prevents an uncontrolled flow of liquid from the 
hair to the face and neck, characterised in that the seal (4) is held 

in a frame (7) for stretching movements and is provided with a 
stretching device (5, 5.1) for enlarging the seal. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
stretching device (5, 5.1) is provided with a plurality of adjusting 

members (8, 8.1 to 8.10). 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in that a manually 
operated stretching device (5.1) is provided.  

 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in that a 
pneumatically or hydraulically operated stretching device (5) is 

provided. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterised in that helmet-type 
apparatus (1) is provided. 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in that the 
apparatus (1) is provided with a detachable crown (18). 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in that an adjusting 
member (8.10) is arranged in each temple region (17). 
Apparatus according to claim 8, characterised in that the 
adjusting members (8.10) are provided with a device (25) 

pressable against the seal (4). 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
adjusting members (8.10) are provided with a fixing device (41). 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in that the

(27). 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in that at least 
some of the adjusting members (8, 8.1 to 8.10) are provided with a 

pressure sensor (42) for detecting the contact pressure of the seal 
(4) against the head (6).  

 
Apparatus according to claim 12, characterised in that a control 
system (51) is associated with the pressure sensor (42). 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterised in that the seal (4) 
is provided with a drainage pipe (33).
