<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a vehicle (31) comprising a mixed (electrical and mechanical) braking system. This mixed braking system comprises asynchronous electric motors (4a to 4d) associated with the wheels (2a to 2d) and a mechanical braking system including a hydraulic circuit (14) and mechanical brakes (18a to 18d). In addition, the mixed braking system comprises measurement electronics (36) connected to rotational frequency sensors (34a to 34d) placed on each of the wheels, these electronics providing a reference signal for means (6) for controlling the asynchronous electric motors, which means adjust the stator frequency of these motors as a function of the value of the reference signal. The braking system according to the invention is anti-lock and is very efficient in any driving situation.
