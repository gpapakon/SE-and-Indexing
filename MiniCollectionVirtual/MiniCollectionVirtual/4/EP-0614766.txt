<ABSTRACT>
Onto a paper support is coated as an uppermost layer, 
on one or both sides, preferably by cast coating, at a dry 

coverage of 5-50 g/m² per side, a coating composition 
comprising by weight 10-50 parts of a binder, e.g. a 

polymer, e.g. in latex form, at least 100 parts of a 
pigment which consists of

 
   30-100% of a synthetic silica of specific surface area 

of 20-600 m²/g, and optionally
 

   70-0% of another pigment (inorganic or organic, 
preferably a synthetic polymer, e.g. as hollow particles),

 
   and optionally dyes or colored pigments; the 75 degree 

gloss (JIS-P8142) of the surface of the resultant coating 
being less than 50%. 
In cast coating, a solidifying agent is added, e.g. an 
acid or a sulphate. 
The coated paper has high gloss, and allows good ink 
transfer from an ink fusion transfer type of thermal 

printer or copier.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns an ink fusion transfer type of 
paper, and more specifically, a paper suitable for ink fusion 
transfer type thermal printers and copiers. EP 529 308 describes an ink jet recording paper which 
comprises a support having at least one surface coated with a 
pigment-containing composition wherein the main pigment component 
is calcium carbonate compounded silica. Smooth, high grade recording paper which has been treated 
by a Super Calendar or the like is used in ink fusion transfer 
type thermal printers or copiers as it is known to give a clear 
image. This is particularly true if the recording surface has 
a smoothness of 100 seconds or more. By making the paper 
smoother so that there is better contact between the paper and 
the ink ribbon, more ink is transferred to the paper surface. 
As a result, reproduction of full tone images is improved, 
however reproduction of half tone images is unsatisfactory. At present, coated paper having a high smoothness and gloss 
is generally not used in ink fusion transfer type thermal 
printers and copiers. The reason for this is that although the 
paper is extremely smooth so that there is uniform contact with 
the ink ribbon, which might be expected to give a good ink copy, 
transfer of ink actually takes place unevenly and image 
reproduction is poor.  
 Non-uniform transfer of ink is particularly evident in the 
case of smooth, high gloss art paper for printing and in the case 
of cast-coated paper. This is due to the fact that, as  
 
there are very few surface imperfections or cavities, molten 
ink does not easily stay on the paper and may be retransferred 
from the paper back to the ink ribbon. Therefore, although coated paper for printing is designed 
to be adequate for ordinary printing applications, it is not 
suitable for ink fusion transfer type thermal printers and 
copiers. If these problems inherent in coated printing paper could 
be resolved, it would be possible to use it for such printers 
and copiers, and images of higher quality than ever before 
might be obtained. In general, in order to confer high surface smoothness on 
coated paper, the surface is flattened under high pressure 
using a Super Calendar or similar device. This paper is not as 
tough as high grade paper, and since it is very dense, it lacks 
the feeling of volume. In addition, the paper has a low gloss 
so that there is a very poor balance with the gloss of the 
image area, and a high image quality comparable to that of 
ordinary offset printing cannot be
