<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a novel reusable transport container system which is tailored, in particular, to suit retail trade or self-service shops. In this case, the contents of the container can be inserted directly with the transport container into the sales shelves and the product for sale or the goods can be removed from the container. In the collapsible transport container (50) according to the invention, for this purpose at least one side wall (58) is designed to be pivotable through 270 DEG . The side wall (58) or pivoting flap is pivoted onto or below the container (50) and exposes a large removal opening through which the product for sale can be removed directly from the container (50) at the front from the sales shelf. To return the empty container (50), it can be collapsed into less than a quarter of its original size.

A closed, collapsible or folding, reusable transportation container 
(50) made of thermoplastics or thermosetting plastics and of 

rectangular construction, comprising sidewalls (56, 58), a base 
plate (52), a closed container cover or closed container cover 

halves (64) and a lower frame part (54) which surrounds the base 
plate (52) and on which at least two opposing sidewalls (56) are 

pivotably articulated, characterised in that at least one sidewall 
(58) or sidewall half is mounted so as to pivot through 270° by 

means of a hinge (60) and in that the sidewall (58) or sidewall half, 
pivotable through 270°, is articulated so as to be upwardly 

pivotable on the same hinge (60) or hinge pin as the upper 
container cover or adjacent container cover half (64). 
A transportation container according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the upwardly pivotable sidewall (58) or sidewall half is 

placeable on the closed cover or on a cover half (64). 
A transportation container according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the sidewall is divided in half in a horizontal 

plane and one half is mounted so as to pivot upwards and the 
other half is mounted so as to pivot downwards. 
A transportation container according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that only an upper portion (front flap) of the  

 
sidewall (58) is articulated as a dispensing flap on the upper cover 

hinge (60) and is mounted so as to be pivotable through 270°, the 
remainder of the sidewall serving as a frame part surrounding the 

sides and the bottom. 
A transportation container according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the size of the sidewall portion is between approx. 50% and 

90% of the size of the sidewall (58). 
A transportation container according to claim 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, 
characterised in that the hinge (60) extends over the entire 

breadth of the container (50) or the sidewall (58). 
A transportation container according to claim 4, 5 or 6, 
characterised in that the frame part, being the remainder of the 

sidewall and surrounding the sides and the bottom of the upper 
rectangular portion (= front flap) or dispensing flap, is pivotably 

connected at the bottom to the frame part (54) of the base plate 
(52) by means of a hinge. 
A transportation container according to claim 4, 5, 6 or 7, 
characterised in that the upper rectangular portion (= front flap) of 

the sidewall (58) as the dispensing flap is provided with fasteners 
(62), and the frame part, being the remainder of the sidewall and 

surrounding the sides and the bottom of the dispensing flap, is 
provided with corresponding recesses in which the fasteners (62) 

engage when the flap is closed.  
 
A transportation container according to any one of the preceding 
claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the sidewalls (56, 58) and the 

flap cover halves (64) are provided with sealing means. 
A transportation container according to any one of the preceding 
claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the cover halves (64) are 

provided with snap fasteners (66) in the corner regions pointing 
towards the centre of the container. 
A transportation container according to any one of the preceding 
claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the corner fasteners (66), 

acting in the direction of an elastic force, snap in place 
automatically on closing and are retractable to release and open 

the cover halves.
