<ABSTRACT>
A gridiron (1) is movable both vertically and horizontally and can thus be moved in space with a single handle. A locking device consisting of a simple screw or clamp device may be provided to securely hold the gridiron in a determined position. The movability of the gridiron (1) is achieved using a parallelogram device (9-16) by means of which the gridiron (1) remains horizontal in all positions. The disclosed gridiron design allows food to be placed and removed from the gridiron much more easily and also the cooking stage of individual parts of the grilled foods to be checked. In addition, the grilled foods can be swivelled to a serving table, so that the guests may choose the piece they wish. The gridiron (1) is provided with a holding device (17-20) which can be mounted either directly on a garden grill or on a separate stand.

Gridiron for open fires, as fireplaces and outdoor grills, 
movable horizontally and vertically by means of a single 

handle (2) and a parallelogramm device (9-16), so that the 
handle (2) remains in horizontal position during such spatial 

movements, and which is lockable in any vertical position 
by means of a locking device, whereas said parallelogramm 

device (9-16) is including two parallel supports (9,10) rotatable 
in bearings (11,12) on a vertical lever (18), characterized 

in that said lever (18) is supported via a horizontal 
rocking lever (17) and a vertical rotating pivot (19) and is 

swingable supported in a bushing (20), that the handle (2) is 
operatable by one hand only, and that the horizontal orientation 

of the handle (2) remains unchanged in all positions of 
the gridiron. 
Gridiron according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
rocking lever (17) for an increased swivel radius consists of 

two unfoldable support rods (6,7), interconnected in a swivel 
point (5), where they are lockable by means of a positioning 

device (22,23). 
Gridiron according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the positioning device comprises a stationary semicircular 

gear (23), in which a movable hook (22) engages by means of 
transmission means. 
Gridiron according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
transmission means is a cable. 
Gridiron according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the bushing (20) is mounted on an outdoor grill 

or a fireplace.  
 
Gridiron according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the bushing (20) is mounted on an independent, 

freely movable support with high tilt resistance. 
Gridiron according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the bushing (20) is placed on a collapsible 

foot consisting of plates (Figs. 7 - 11). 
Gridiron according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that the swivel range of the handle (2) in vertical 

direction is adjustable. 
Gridiron according to one of the claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that it is equipped with a hot-keeping grid for the 

finished food located above the grid level.
