<ABSTRACT>
Roof window (1) with tilting sash (20), in the case of which the bearing elements (3, 4) which support and guide the tilting sash are fitted on both sides on carriage-like supporting plates (7) which, for lowering the opened tilting sash (20) into a cleaning position, are guided displaceably in guide rails (10) on the outer frame. In order to facilitate installation, the guide rails (10) are retained on both sides of the outer rail (21) in lower-lying pockets (12), via which they can be pivoted into their fitting position such that, the upper end, they latch in with latching elements (15) in this position.
