<ABSTRACT>
A method of rapidly producing a final wax-free chewing gum product is disclosed. The chewing gum is made using a chewing gum base which is devoid or substantially free of wax. The gum base includes about 20 to about 60 weight per cent synthetic elastomer, 0 to about 30 weight per cent natural elastomer, about 5 to about 55 weight per cent elastomer plasticizer, about 4 to about 40 weight per cent filler, about 5 to about 40 weight per cent softener, and optional minor amounts of miscellaneous ingredients such as colors, antioxidants, etc. Chewing gum compositions are provided which compositions temper rapidly in production and which chewing gums provide an initial soft bite, but still are produced more efficiently than comparable wax containing chewing gums.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method making a
wax-free chewing gum having improved processability and
chewing texture, and to improved wax-free chewing gums
prepared by this method.In US-A-5023093, there is disclosed a chewing gum
base with reduced calorie content. The central
components of that gum base are 10-25% polyvinyl acetate
having a medium molecular weight of about 35,000 to
55,000, 4.5% to about 10% acetylated monoglyceride.U.S Patent 3,984,574, issued to Comollo, discloses
an abhesive chewing gum base in which the non-tack
properties were achieved by eliminating conventional
chewing gum base ingredients which were found to
contribute to chewing gum tackiness, and by substituting
non-tacky ingredients in place of the conventional
ingredients. Specifically, it was discovered that three
classes of materials account for conventional chewing
gum tackiness. These materials are elastomers, resins,
and waxes.In W08702223 there is described a carbohydrate
syrup plasticizer composition for use in chewing gums
to improve flexibility. The syrup comprises
carbohydrate solids and water with less than 30% of
the solids having a degree of polymerisation of one
and more 20% solids with a degree of polymerisation of
four or greater. The ratio of carbohydrate solids to
plasticizing agent in the composition is between 0.5:1
and 100:1 and the total water content of the
composition is less than 20%. Comollo eliminated natural and some synthetic
elastomers from chewing gum base, and substituted in
their place one or more non-tacky synthetic elastomers
such as polyisobutylene, polyisoprene, isobutylene-isoprene
copolymer and butadiene-styrene copolymer.
Comollo also eliminated the tack-producing natural
resins and modified natural resins and used instead
relatively high amounts of hydrogenated or partially
hydrogenated vegetable oils or animal fats. Finally,
Comollo completely excluded waxes from the gum base,
but included polyvinyl acetate, fatty acids, and mono
and diglycerides of fatty acids. Comollo made no
mention of improved processing efficiencies.The present invention is directed to an
improved and more efficient method of manufacturing a
wax-free chewing gum containing a wax-free chewing gum
base which is free of hydrocarbon-containing waxes and
the fast setting chewing gums prepared therefrom. The
gum base of the invention can include quantities of
synthetic elastomer, elastomer plasticizer, filler and
softener, and, like the gum base of Comollo, is
substantially free of wax. However, the gum base of
