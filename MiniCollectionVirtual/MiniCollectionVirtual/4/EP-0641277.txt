<ABSTRACT>
A method of injection moulding an undercut formation (26) on a circular body (20) wherein said formation is moulded in a series of arcuate sections (28) alternating with spaces (29), and wherein the moulding core (24) which produces the formation is extracted by firstly relatively rotating said body (20) and said core (24) so that the body is expanded radially and then ejecting the body off the core. The method is applicable to the manufacture of novel closure members and coupling elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of moulding plastics
articles, according to the preamble of claim 1,
and to
a plastics closure member according to the preamble of claim 10
and a plastics coupling
element comprising such an undercut formation according to the preamble
of claim 18.Moulding undercut formations, for example an internal
flange around a circular lid or similar closure member, or
around a ring coupling element, presents well known
difficulties for injection moulding. The flange can be moulded
by the use of an appropriately recessed core, but the radial
extent of such a flange i.e. the amount of the undercut, must
be relatively limited because of the need to extract the core
from the moulding. Further, conventional techniques require
the undercut to have a chamfered or sloped surface which can
produce a camming action to stretch the moulding to get the
flange past the mould core projection which formed it.In moulding closure members and coupling elements from
plastics materials, this need to have a chamfered or sloped
surface can make the closure member or coupling element less
secure and less positive, when for example, the closure member 
or coupling element is required to be a press fit over a lip on the
external surface of a container or mating coupling element.It has been proposed to produce undercut formations of the type
described by injection moulding using a collapsing core, but in such
cases the core leaves a so-called "witness line" on the moulded
article, which is the imprint of the line between the movable parts
of the collapsing core. In the case of a closure member or coupling
element, this line can appear on the internal wall above the
undercut and can severely limit the effectiveness of the seal made
by the closure member or coupling element.DE-A-3110201 describes an apparatus for producing plastic caps
by injection moulding, having a mould tool comprising a hollow mould
body and a core projecting into this body, which core is arranged
to be inserted in the mould body while maintaining the hollow space
defining the cap, the core comprising three members arranged
concentrically and having a common axis, of which the inner member
and the outer member are rigidly arranged and the middle member is
rotatable about the axis. GB-A-1,579,875 discloses a coupling for an
ostomy bag.The invention aims to allow deeper undercuts which moreover
do not need to be sloped, and to avoid the production of witness
lines. A further object of the invention is to produce an improved
closure member
