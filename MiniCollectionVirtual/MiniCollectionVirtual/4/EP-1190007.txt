<DESCRIPTION>
 REACTIVE ADHESIVES AND COATINGS WITH TRIFUNCTIONALOLEFINIC MONOMERSBackground of the InventionThe invention relates to adhesives and coatings that include a free radical polymerizable component wherein the free radical polymerizable component includes a trifunctional olefinic monomer. Reactive acrylic adhesives that cure by free radical polymerization of(meth)acrylic esters (i.e., acrylates) are known, but suffer from certain drawbacks. Commercially important acrylic adhesives tend to have an offensive odor, particularly those that are made from methyl methacrylate. Methyl methacrylate-based acrylic adhesives also have low flash points (approximately 59°F). Low flash points are particularly an issue during storage and transportation of the adhesives. If the flash point is 141°F or lower, the U.S. Department of Transportation classifies the product as "Flammable" and requires marking and special storage and transportation conditions.Another problem with reactive, two-part, acrylic adhesives utilizing a benzoyl peroxide/tertiary amine free radical initiator system is that the volume mix ratio of one part with the other part is not 1 : 1 - it is typically 4: 1 or 10: 1. Obviously, this requires more careful measurement calculation during application of the adhesive and causes packaging problems. The mix ratio problem results largely from the instability of mixtures of free radical initiators such as benzoyl peroxide with (meth)acrylic monomers at room temperature. The free radical initiators generate a sufficient amount of free radical to gel the monomers over a short time period.Styrenic monomers such as styrene and vinyl toluene have been suggested as alternatives to (meth)acrylic adhesives (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 2,981,650), but these have at least two drawbacks. The film formed from styrenic monomers is too brittle and the cure rate of styrenic monomers is too slow to be useful as a structural adhesive. A two part reactive adhesive with reduced odor and flammability that could be mixed at a 1:1 volume ratio without comprising shelf life stability or adhesive performance would be very desirable. 

 Summary of the InventionThe composition of the invention is a reactive adhesive or coating that includes two parts or sides that are mixed together at the time of use. The reaction of the two parts acts to cure the adhesive or coating. It has been discovered that a certain copolymerization system provides a reactive adhesive or coating composition that has very useful characteristics.In particular, a
