<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED BEARING ASSEMBLY AND METHOD OF MANUFACTUREThe present invention relates generally to bearing assemblies of the type which have an inner race, an outer relatively rotatable race, and endplates secured to one of the races for retaining the other race from axial movement, and more particularly, to an improved bearing assembly of such type and to a method for securing endplates to the bearing race.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It has long been the practice to secure endplates to the inner race of a bearing assembly by peening or flaring lips on opposite sides of the inner race into locking relation about the peripheries of the respective endplates. Such metalworking, however, can cause distortion and dimensional size change of the inner race in excess of industry standards. Other methods of securing the endplates to the bearing race have suffered from similar drawbacks. These methods include staking or deforming the inner race at circumferentially spaced locations to secure the endplate, axially deforming a brass band into interposed relation between the endplate and inner race to cause radial expansion and secure retention of the endplate and inner race, and forcing the endplate onto the bearing race with an interference fit. The forces exerted on the inner bearing race in each method can cause distortion of the inner bearing race in excess of acceptable limits.OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a bearing assembly in which endplates are 

 reliably secured to one of the bearing races without distortion or appreciable size change of the race.Another object is to provide an improved method of manufacturing such bearing assembly. A related object is to provide a method of reliably securing endplates to one of the bearing races without exerting significant forces on the bearing race.Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon reading the following detailed description and upon reference to the drawings, in which:BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIGURE 1 is a break away perspective of an illustrative bearing assembly embodying the present invention;FIG. 2 is a perspective of one of the endplates used in the illustrated bearing assembly;FIG. 3 is an enlarged fragmentary section of the endplate shown in FIG. 2;FIG. 4 is a fragmentary section depicting the method of manufacture of the illustrated bearing assembly; andFIG. 5 is an enlarged fragmentary section of the completed bearing assembly.While the invention is susceptible

10. The bearing assembly of claim 8 in which said end plate has an inboard side disposed adjacent said races, and said notches are formed in said inboard side of said end plate and are not visible externally said bearing assembly.
11. A bearing assembly comprising an inner race, an outer race concentrically surrounding said inner race for relative rotational movement, a pair of annular endplates, 


 means securing said endplates to opposite ends of one of said races for limiting relative lateral movement between the races, and said endplate securing means being solidified metal which is applied to said endplates and said one bearing race in molten form and which upon solidification secures the endplates in fixed relation to said one bearing race.
