<ABSTRACT>
A bipolar battery comprising a plurality of 
bipolar electrodes stacked together, each bipolar 

electrode comprising a conductive septum (2) having 
positive and negative active material on opposite 

faces thereof. Each electrode has a non-conductive 
frame (6) formed thereabout, and a mesa-like lattice 

(8) which is integral with the frame (6), overlays 
each face of the septum (2) and is defined by an 

annular shoulder (14a,14b) formed between the border 
(5) of the lattice (8) and the frame (6). Discrete 

spacer frames (30) interjacent the electrode frames 
(6) separate the electrodes from each other and define 

a region (32) thereabout for retaining electrolyte of 
the battery. The faces of the spacer frame (30) each 

include an annular recess (14a,14b) contiguous to an 
inner rim (33) thereof which receives, in nesting 

fashion, the mesa-like lattices (8) for interlocking 
the frames (6,30) together.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to bipolar electric 
storage batteries of the face-to-face electrode type 
as specified in the preamble of claim 1, and more 
particularly to a unique packaging arrangement 
therefor. Bipolar batteries employ either one of two 
types of bipolar electrodes, i.e., face-to-face or 
side-by-side. Face-to-face type bipolar electrodes, 
utilise an electrolyte-resistant, impervious, 
substantially planar conductive septum having a first 
polarity active material on one face thereof and an 
opposite polarity active material on an opposite face 
thereof. The bipolar electrodes are mounted in 
non-conductive frames and are stacked together so that 
opposite polarity faces of adjacent bipolar electrodes 
oppose each other across an electrolyte-filled gap 
which also contains an electrolyte-permeable, 
dendrite-suppressing separator (eg, microporous 
polyethylene, glass mat or microporous PVC). The 
frames are typically either clamped or adhesively 
secured together. One such battery is exemplified by 
US-A-3,728,158 (Poe et al). It is known for the electrically-conductive 
septum that separates the opposite polarity active 
materials of the bipolar electrode to comprise either 
(1) a thin metal plate (e.g., lead in the case of a 
Pb-acid battery), (2) an electrically-conductive 
polymer, or (3) a non-conductive polymer having a 
plurality of rivet-like conductors embedded therein 
for electrically communicating one face of the septum 
to the other. For a number of reasons, the use of 
solid metal plates is preferred for long-lived, 
high-power, bipolar batteries. A metal plate septum 
particularly useful for lead acid batteries is  
 
described in our co-pending patent application no 
           corresponding to United States patent 
application US Serial No 08/079,030 filed concurrently 
herewith. Other metal or conductive septums are 
useful with other types of battery systems (eg, 
alkaline batteries) as is well-known in the art. Two 
of the problems associated with the commercialisation 
of face-to-face type bipolar batteries are (1) 
ensuring that the active material remains in contact 
with the septum throughout the life of the battery, 
and (2) manufacturing problems associated with the 
handling, alignment, assembly and reliable sealing of 
so many individual components to form the finished 
battery. A bipolar battery according to the present 
invention is characterised by the features specified 
in the characterising portion of claim 1. It is an object of the present invention to 
pr

bipolar electrodes, each comprising a substantially 

planar, electrolyte-impervious,
