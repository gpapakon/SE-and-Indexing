<ABSTRACT>
Human basic myelin protein (h-MBP) has a molecular weight of 18.5 KD and contains 170 amino acid residues. Synthetic peptides ranging in length from 8 to 25 residues and covering the entire length of the protein have been produced. Antibodies to h-MBP (anti-MBP) were found to be neutralized by the synthetic peptides, which span the h-MBP from about amino acid residue (61) to about amino acid residue (106). The synthetic peptides, which cover both the amino (about residues 1 to 63) and carboxy (about residues 117 to 162) terminals of h-MBP did not neutralize purified anti-MBP. Accordingly, intrathecal administration of selected synthetic MBP peptides may be used as a treatment for Multiple Sclerosis by neutralizing anti-MBP.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with the use of selected
polypeptides in neutralizing antibodies to a
human myelin protein. This invention also relates
to a method of using these peptides for
the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis.Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a multifocal
demyelinating disease of the human central nervous system
(CNS) associated with inflammation. Increased
intra-blood-brain barrier (intra-BBB) IgG synthesis is a
hallmark of MS (Tourtelotte, W.W., J Neurol Sci 10:
279-304, 1970; Link, H. and Tibbling, G., Scand J Clin Lab
Invest 37: 397-401, 1977; Tourtelotte, W.W. and Ma, B.,
Neurology 28: 76-83, 1978; Walsh, J.M. and Tourtelotte,
W.W., In: Hallpike, J.F., Adams, C.W.M. and Tourtelotte,
W.W., eds. Multiple sclerosis. Baltimore. Williams &
Wilkins, 1982: 275-358; and Warren, K.G., and Catz, I. Ann
Neurol 17: 475-480, 1985).IgG synthesis within the BBB is generally
elevated in clinically definite MS patients (Schumacher,
G.A., Beebe, G., Kibler R.E., et al., Ann NY Acad Sci
15:266-272, 1965) with active or inactive disease. The
specificity of the majority of the CNS IgG is unknown.
While a small proportion has antiviral activity or reacts
against brain antigens, nucleic acids, erythrocytes or
smooth muscle antigens, the nonspecific portion may
represent polyclonal activation of B-cells (Tourtelotte,
W.W., and Ma, B., Neurology 28:76-83, 1978). During the
last decade there has been considerable interest in the 
study of antibodies to specific myelin proteins.Following the detection of circulating immune
complexes containing myelin basic protein (MBP) as their
antigenic component (Dasgupta, M.K., Catz, I, Warren, K.G.
et al., Can J Neurol Sci 10:239-243, 1983), increased
titers of antibodies to MBP (anti-MBP) were observed in the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with active forms of
MS (Warren, K.G. and Catz, I., Ann Neurol 209:20-25, 1986).
Clinically, MS is characterized by phases of disease
activity such as acute relapses or chronic progression, and
by phases of clinical remission. Active MS is associated
with increased levels of intrathecally produced anti-MBP
(Warren, K.G. arid Catz, I., Ann Neurol 209:20-25, 1986; and
Catz, I. and Warren, K.G., Can J Neurol Sci 13:21-24,
1986). These antibodies are found predominantly in free
(F) form during acute relapses and predominantly in bound
(B) form when the disease is insidiously progressive
(Warren, K.G. and Catz, I., Ann Neurol 209:20-25, 1986).
During acute relapses, CSF anti-MBP titers correlated with
disease activity (Warren, K.G. and
