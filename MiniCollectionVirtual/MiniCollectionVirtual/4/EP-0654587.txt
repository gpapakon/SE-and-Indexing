<ABSTRACT>
A variable geometry turbine comprises a housing (1) including an 
annular cavity (19) which supports a moveable annular wall member (5). 

An annular inlet passageway (4) is defined between a face of the 
moveable wall member (5) and a facing wall (6) of the housing (1). The 

moveable wall member (5) is moveable so as to vary the width of the 
inlet passageway (4). Gas tight seals (20, 21) are provided between the 

wall member (5) and radially inner and outer surfaces of the cavity 
(19) and apertures (24) are provided through the face of the annular 

wall member (5). The arrangement is such that the pressure difference 
between the cavity (19) and the inlet passageway (4) is reduced so that 

the total axial load on the wall member (5) due to gas flow through 
the inlet passageway (4) is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a variable geometry turbine, particularly, but
not exclusively, for use in an internal combustion engine.Turbines generally comprise a turbine wheel mounted in a turbine chamber, an
inlet passageway extending radially inwards towards the turbine chamber, an inlet
chamber arranged around the radially outer end of the inlet passageway, and an outlet
passageway extending axially from the turbine chamber. The passageways and
chamber communicate such that pressurised gas admitted to the inlet chamber flows
through the inlet passageway to the outlet passageway via the turbine chamber,
thereby driving the turbine wheel. In the case of a turbo charger for an internal
combustion engine, the turbine wheel drives a shaft which in turn drives a rotary
compressor.In a variable geometry turbine, one wall of the inlet passageway is provided by
a moveable wall member the position of which is adjustable, relative to a facing wall
of the inlet passageway, to control the width of the inlet passageway. A variety of
actuation mechanisms, including hydraulic and mechanical, have been proposed to
control the position of the moveable wall member.For example, US patent number 5,044,880 describes a variable geometry
turbine in which the moveable wall member is annular and formed from a sheet
material, and is mounted within an annular cavity in the turbine housing. The wall
member has a tubular portion extending from the radially outermost periphery of the
wall member and away from the way from the facing wall of the housing. A gas tight
seal is disposed between the tubular portion and the turbine housing to prevent gas
leaking from the inlet passageway to the space behind the annular wall member. Such
leakage would impair the efficiency of the turbine.US patent number 4,403,914 discloses a variable geometry device for use in a
turbine engine having a support housing, a rotor contained within the support housing
and a pair of spaced walls forming an annular and radially extending passageway open
at one end to the rotor. An annular recessed channel is formed in one of the support 
housing walls while a ring is mounted within the channel and moveable between a
retracted position in which the ring is nested within the channel and an extended
position in which the ring protrudes transversely into and variably restricts the
passageway so that the restriction of the fluid passageway is substantially proportional
to the transverse position of the ring.In a variable geometry turbine, when the volume of
