<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for treating microbially polluted waters by UV radiation, in particular waters containing a pathogen of the genus Legionella, which apparatus has a vessel receiving water and a UV source (lamp) acting on the water. By means of the invention an apparatus is to be created in which the UV source and thus ultimately the entire apparatus can be operated more gently and economically. This is achieved by the UV source (17) being dimmable by means of a choke (35) connected thereto.

Apparatus for treating microbically polluted waters, in particular waters
containing a germ of the genus Legionella, by UV radiation, comprising


a tank (3), which takes up the water, and a U-shaped ultraviolet emitter
(17), which acts on the water and the intensity of irradiation of which is

adjustable,
characterized in that
the ultraviolet emitter (17) is enclosed by an immersion pipe (12), which
projects into the water and has a lower semi-spherical end (13), and in that

in vicinity to its U-shaped bow (21), it is connected with the semi-spherical
inside wall (23) of the immersion pipe (12) by means of a heat-conducting

body (22).
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the heat-conducting
body (22) comprises a clamp-type section (24) which embraces

both legs of the ultraviolet emitter (17) and is preferably made from metal.
Apparatus according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the heat-conducting
body (22) comprises one or several spring strips (25), which are

preferably integrally united with the clamp-type section (24) and the free
ends of which rest flatly on the inside wall (23) of the immersion pipe (12). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 at its
lower end (13), the immersion pipe (12) is held at a distance from the

housing inside wall (15) by means of a prop (14).
Apparatus according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the upper end of
the prop (14) is a spring strip centering the immersion pipe (12) and the

lower end is a discharging screw (18).
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 the vertical distance between the lower end (13) of the immersion pipe
(12) and the housing inside wall (15), in this area, approximately corresponds

to the distance between the immersion-pipe outside wall (16) and
the housing inside wall (15) in that part of the immersion pipe which is

formed above the lower end (13).
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 the ultraviolet emitter (17) is a low-pressure emitter, preferably a mercury-vapor
emitter.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 the ultraviolet emitter (17) comprises at least one U-shaped rod (20)
which projects preferably centrically into the tank (3) in the form of an

immersion reactor.
