<ABSTRACT>
In this method, the audio and/or video signals are allocated to one or more broadcast programmes. The digital data stream transmitted via the satellite or cable channel is divided into a number of part-data streams. The part-data streams are transmitted in frequency-division or time-division multiplex. The number of part data streams allocated to the broadcast programmes transmitted via the satellite or cable channel is variable.

Method for transmitting digital compressed audio
and/or video signals over a satellite or cable channel,

wherein the audio and/or video signals are assigned to one
or more radio programmes, the digital data stream

transmitted via the satellite or cable channel is divided
into a pl
urality of component data streams, the component
data streams are transmitted in frequency-division

multiplex or time-division multiplex and the assignment of
the number of component data streams to the radio

programmes transmitted over the satellite or cable channel
is variable, characterized in that, in the data compression

of the audio and/or video signals, an adaptive
quantization, a run length coding and a storage in buffer

memories takes place, the occupancies of the buffer
memories are measured, the adaptive quantization takes

place in this case as a function of the occupancies of the
buffer memories and the number of component data streams is

automatically assigned to the radio programmes transmitted
over the satellite or cable channel by evaluating at least

two occupancy measurements.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
capacity of a component data stream is chosen so that the

transmission of a compressed audio signal is possible in a
component data stream.
Method according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the number of component data

streams is automatically assigned to the radio programmes
transmitted over the satellite or cable channel.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
adaptive quantization and the automatic assignment of the

number of component data streams takes place for at least
two audio and/or video signals to be transmitted in a 

channel by means of a common control unit to which the
items of information relating to the buffer occupancies are

fed.
Method according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the transmission capacity

occupied by each radio programme is automatically
determined and is charged to the programme provider.
Method according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that digital compressed audio

and/or video signals are subjected to a 4PSK modulation and
the modulated signals are transmitted in time-division

multiplex.
Method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that digital compressed audio and/or video

signals are subjected to an 8PSK modulation with trellis
coding.
Method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that digital compressed audio and/or video

signals are subjected to OFDM.
Method according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that one or more of the radio

programmes is enciphered at the transmission end and
deciphered at the reception end.
Method according to Claim 9, characterized in that
deciphering at the reception end takes place only after

inputting a code number or after clearance by the
transmitter.
Method according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the component data streams

are transmitted in the form of individual frames. 
Method according to Claim 11, characterized in that
the length of the individual frames is variable and is

indicated by an additional item of information contained in
the data code bits.
