<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disposable fibreboard box 
containing a lighttightly wrapped roll of photographic film wound on 
a hollow core. Disposable fibreboard boxes containing a lighttightly wrapped 
roll of photographic film wound on a hollow core are known, wherein 
at either end of the film roll a roll-supporting flange is provided 
which has a hub fitting in the corresponding end of the core for 
supporting the roll out of contact with the side-wall panels of the 
box. These flanges are usually made of a thermoplastic by injection 
moulding and comprise a flat square panel with a cylindrical hub, or 
they are assembled from several parts glued together. The described type of packaging serves only for the delivery of 
the photographic material in good order to the user and is disposed 
after its unloading. The packaged roll of photographic material can be arranged for 
daylight loading so that a reloadable cassette of a camera, 
phototype-setter or the like can be reloaded in daylight, but the 
photographic material can also be conventionally wrapped so that the 
use of a darkroom is required to transfer the roll of photographic 
material from the transport box into a cassette with a lighttight 
exit slot for dispensing the photographic material in the exposure 
apparatus. Examples of the described packagings are disclosed in US-A-4,148,395, 
US-A-4,505,387 and US-A-4,911,299.  
 It is the object of the present invention to provide an improved 
fibreboard box of the type referred to, which readily lends itself 
to ecologic disposal. In accordance with the present invention, a disposable 
fibreboard box containing at least one lighttightly wrapped roll of 
photographic film wound on a hollow core, and a roll-supporting 
flange at either roll end, each said flange having a hub fitting in 
the corresponding core end for supporting the roll out of contact 
with the side-wall panels of the box, said flanges being in 
supporting contact with the corresponding end-wall panels of the 
box, is characterised thereby that said roll-supporting flanges and 
hubs are integrally made of moulded fibre pulp and have a plurality 
of stiffening ribs located in the plane of the flanges. The packaging, which remains after the filmroll(s) has (have) 
been removed, is a completely recyclable, bio-degradable product of 
extreme flexibility. The term "photographic film" as used in the present description 
encompasses film as well as paper supports coated with a light-sensitive 
layer for use in the production of

<CLAIMS>
A disposable fibreboard box (10) containing at least one 

lighttightly wrapped roll (37) of photographic film wound on a 
hollow core (18), and a roll-supporting flange (26,27) at either 

roll end, each said flange having a hub (28) fitting in the 
corresponding core end for supporting the roll out of contact with 

the side-wall panels of the box, said flanges being in supporting 
contact with the corresponding end-wall panels (16,17) of the box, 

characterised in that said roll-supporting flanges (26,27) and hubs 
(28) are integrally moulded from fibre pulp and have a plurality 

of stiffening ribs (30) located in the base of the flange. 
A disposable fibreboard box according to claim 1, wherein 
the lowest edge of the hub and the deepest points of the ribs are 

spaced from the bottom edge (35) of the flange whereby the flanges 
provide a resilient support for the roll of film in axial direction 

while the free edge of said flanges is in supporting contact with 
the corresponding end-wall panel (16,17) of the box. 
A disposable fibreboard box according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein said stiffening ribs (30) extend from the base of the hub 

(28) towards the side walls (36) of the flange. 
A disposable fibreboard box according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
wherein said stiffening ribs (30) extend at a right angle to a 

corresponding side wall (36) of the flange. 
A disposable fibreboard box according to any of claims 1 to 
4, wherein said roll-supporting flanges (26,27) have a generally 

square base, the side walls (36) of said base being slightly convexly 
curved and the largest size 
e
 of said base being larger than the 
corresponding inner dimension 
w
 of said fibreboard box (10). 
A disposable fibreboard box according to any of claims 1 to 
5, wherein said hub (28) has a conical shape, the largest diameter 
b
 
of the hub which is in contact with the core (18) of said roll of 

photographic film being smaller than the inner diameter 
d
 of said 
core.  

 
A disposable fibreboard box according to any of claims 1 to 
6, wherein each said flange (26,27) has at each corner at the side 

of the hub a stud (31,32,33,34) with a height equalling that of the 
hub (28). 
A disposable fibreboard box according to any of claims 1 to 
7, which comprises at least two lighttightly wrapped rolls of 

photographic film each wound on a hollow core, and roll-supporting 
flanges each having at least two hubs for engaging a corresponding 

core end of a film roll. 
A disposable fibreboard box according to claim 8, which 
comprises four film rolls.
