<ABSTRACT>
Fitted between the nozzle point (6) and the mould insert (1) is a thin-walled centring bush (8), which engages into a shoulder (7) of the mould insert (1) and consequently effects a mutual centring and sealing of the nozzle point (6) and the mould insert (1). This avoids material entering the cavity (11) between the nozzle point (6) and the mould insert (1) and consequently impairing, or delaying, the colour change, and has the effect that the valve pin (9) is effectively centred, so that a cylindrical pin tip (9a) can seal a very short cylindrical part (2a) of a gate (2) without any play. The heat transfer between the heated nozzle parts (4, 6, 8) and the mould insert (1) can nevertheless be kept low by it being possible for the mutual centring to take place at narrow contact points.

Injection moulding nozzle for an injection mould, 
comprising a mould plate (1) having a gate opening (2), 

a nozzle tip (6),
 
a heatable nozzle body (4) in which the nozzle tip (6) 

is maintained with a good thermal contact,
 
an axially displaceable nozzle needle (9) for the purpose 

of closing and opening the gate opening (2), which 
is guided by a guiding ring (14) having passages,
 
characterised in that
 
the point (9a) of the nozzle needle (9) and the gate 

opening (2) comprise at least one cylindrical area, said 
areas being adjusted to each other in such a manner that 

a complete closure results when they engage in one another, 
and in that
 
in addition to the guiding ring (14), a centering bushing 

(8) is provided which does not obstruct the flow of 
the injected material and which axially centers the 

nozzle tip (6) with respect to the mould plate (1) immediately 
next to the gate opening, which guides the 

point (9a) of the nozzle needle (9) in such a manner and 
seals a cavity (11) between the nozzle tip (6) and the 

mould plate (1) in such a manner as to prevent the entrance 
of injection moulding material in such a manner 

that a direct heat transfer from the heated nozzle tip 
(6) to the mould plate (1) does not occur and an indirect 

heat transfer over the centering bushing (8), the 
nozzle needle (9), and the injection moulding material 

is minimal. 
Injection moulding nozzle according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the gate opening (2) comprises a 

single cylindrical area (2a),
 
and in that the length of this cylindrical area (2a) is 

about 0.2 mm.  
 
Injection moulding nozzle according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the gate opening (2) and the nozzle 

needle (9) each comprise two adjoining cylindrical 
areas of different diameters,
 
the cylindrical area of the nozzle needle (9) whose diameter 

is greater further comprising grooves in the longitudinal 
direction of the needle (9). 
Injection nozzle according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the centering bushing (8) is thin-walled 

and made of steel. 
Injection nozzle according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the centering bushing (8) comprises 

a central bore and a crown of peripheral bores 
(10). 
Injection nozzle according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the centering bushing (8, 8a) is 

bipartite.
