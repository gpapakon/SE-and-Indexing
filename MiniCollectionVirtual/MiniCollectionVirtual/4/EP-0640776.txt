<ABSTRACT>
A balancing mechanism (1) for an internal combustion 
engine includes a balancing shaft (14) capable of being 

disposed adjacent to the crankshaft (7) of the internal-combustion 
engine to enable compact construction. 

Balance weights (15) are disposed with each balance weight 
positioned between crank webs (9) of a crankshaft (7) so as to 

correspond to a crankpin (8). The balancing shaft (14) has 
journals having a diameter D
A
 and a middle portion has a 
smaller diameter D
B
 and is provided with a thrust flange 
formed near the right journal so as to be in sliding 

contact with the inner side surface of a right-hand 
bearing portion (2a) of the crankcase. A portion of the crank 

web (9) corresponding to the thrust flange is recessed to form 
a depression. The balancing shaft driving mechanism (14) 

includes a driving (21) gear securely mounted on the crankshaft (7), 
and a driven (23) gear securely mounted on the balancing 

shaft (14) and in mesh with the driving gear (21). A particular 
tooth of the driving gear brought into mesh with a 

particular tooth of the driven gear are marked 
respectively with identical locating marks to coincide 

with each other when a point on the tooth surface of one 
of the particular teeth corresponding to the middle point 

between the tip and the root of the same particular tooth 
and a point on the tooth surface of the other particular 

tooth corresponding to the middle point between the tip 
and the root of the same particular tooth are in contact 

with each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present device relates to a compact balancing
mechanism for an internal-combustion engine, having a
balancing shaft disposed as close as possible to the
crankshaft of the internal-combustion engine. In
addition, the present invention relates to an internal-combustion
engine provided with a balancing shaft which is
rotated synchronously with the crankshaft in a direction
reverse to the direction in which the crankshaft rotates
at the same angular velocity as that at which the
crankshaft rotates to balance the primary component of the
inertial force of a reciprocating mass.In a conventional balancing mechanism shown in Figure
4, Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) JP-A-57 161 333 on which the preamble part of claim 1 is based, a
crankshaft 03 and a balancing shaft 05 are supported for
rotation in parallel to each other on a crankcase 01. A
thrust flange 06 is formed on the balancing shaft 05 so as
to be in sliding contact with the side surface of a
bearing portion 02 of the crankcase 01 to restrain the 
balancing shaft 05 from axial movement. The balancing
shaft 05 is provided integrally with balance weights 07.
Each balance weight 07 is positioned between the two
adjacent crank webs 04 of the crankshaft 03.In the balancing mechanism shown in Figure 4, the
diameter of the middle portion 09 of the balancing shaft
05 is equal to that of the journals 08 of the balancing
shaft 05. Therefore, if the crankshaft 03 is disposed
very close to the balancing shaft 05, the crank webs 04 of
the crankshaft 03 collides against the middle portion 09
and the thrust flange 06 of the balancing shaft 05 and
hence it is impossible to form the internal-combustion
engine in a compact construction by disposing the
balancing shaft 05 very close to the crankshaft 03.In an internal-combustion engine provided with a
balancing shaft to balance the primary component of the
inertial force of a reciprocating mass, the balancing
shaft and the crankshaft are interlocked by gears of the
same dimensions mounted on the balancing shaft and the
crankshaft so as to be meshed to drive the balancing shaft
for rotation synchronous with the rotation of the
crankshaft in a direction reverse to the direction of
rotation of the crankshaft at the same angular velocity as
that at which the crankshaft rotates.The balancing shaft and the crankshaft are provided
with balance weights, respectively, so that the fixed
angular relation between the balance weights is maintained
to suppress the vibrations of the internal-combustion
engine by balancing the
