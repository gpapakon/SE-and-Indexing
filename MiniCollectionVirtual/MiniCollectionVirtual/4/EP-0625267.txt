<ABSTRACT>
A method of analysis comprises forming complexes between micro-particles (12) such as plastics beads, a linking moiety (14) such as an antibody attached to the micro-particle, and a target (16) such as a micro-organism and observing the electro-rotation properties of the complex (10). Electro-rotation is produced by applying a rotating electric field in a plane transverse to the direction of observation. The differing electro-rotation properties of the micro-particles (12) coated with antibody (14) alone and the complexes (10) are visually observable and in suitable cases discrimination is possible between complexes containing live target micro-organisms and those containing dead micro-organisms. The target (16) may be bound to a labelling moiety (14) such as a gold or magnetic particle to enhance change in electro-rotation properties produced on complex formation. A wide range of target species are detectable, including nucleic acids and proteins.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to analytical methods based
upon the observation of the rotation of micro-particles in
response to a rotating field.It is known that micro-particles in the form of plastics
beads held in suspension in a liquid will rotate in response
to a rotating electric field applied through an electrode
array. This phenomenon is known as electro-rotation. In a
similar manner it is known that a micro-particle presenting
a magnetic dipole or in which such a dipole can be induced
will rotate in response to a rotating magnetic field.
The rotation of a micro-particle in response to the
rotation of an applied field, whether electric or magnetic,
is referred to herein as "field-rotation".It has been suggested that electro-rotation could
have analytical uses. Thus Arnold and Zimmerman (Natur
Wissenschaften, 69 (1982) 297; Z. Natur Forsh., C.37 (1982)
908-915) suggested that a possible application of the electro-rotation
of cells could be the detection of interactions
between the cell membrane and ecotoxicological substances
which affect the electrical characteristics of the membrane
such as by altering its permeability to certain ions. Thus
it has been found that the electro-rotation properties of a
yeast cell may be observably affected by heavy metal ions.
This may be due to the electrical characteristics of the cell
membrane being changed by the heavy metal ions. Such methods
have potential applicability largely only to species which
exhibit toxicity to such cells.The present invention is based upon the observation that
the rotational characteristics of a micro-particle can be
altered by the formation of a complex involving the micro-particle
and some target to be analysed and that by
observation of the distinct rotational properties of the
complex, information regarding the target can be derived. Whilst methods according to the invention may be employed
in a wide variety of analytical applications, they have
particular relevance to the analysis of samples containing
micro-organisms or micro-biological products. Current methods
of identifying micro-organisms themselves, e.g. bacteria,
involve the use of immunological, DNA, biochemical and micro-biological
techniques. Traditionally, standard micro-biological
techniques such as plating the organisms out and
observing their growth on selective media have been employed
for the detection of specific organisms. More recently,
techniques such as immunoassay involving the use of antibodies
directed at the specific organisms in question and methods
