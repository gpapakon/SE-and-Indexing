<ABSTRACT>
A binding machine is described for use in uncoiling the fingers of a binding comb (50), preparatory to an insertion of the fingers (54) of the comb into the apertures (48) provided in a packet or stack of sheets (46) to be bound together. The machine comprises a housing (6) supported for rectilinear reciprocal movement a drive plate (8), said drive plate being provided adjacent opposite side edges with a series of apertures (10), affording a rack, engageable by respective pinions (12) of the machine. The housing (6) is provided with a plurality of fixed abutment elements (28), a clamping member (16) being mounted on the housing for movement between a retracted position and an advanced position, in which advanced position clamping elements (18) of the clamping member are disposed closely adjacent to fixed abutment elements (28), to clamp the spine (52) of a binding comb therebetween. An operating member (36) is also mounted on the housing for movement between a retracted position and an advanced position, such movement of the operating member causing fingers (38) thereof to engage within the coiled fingers (54) of the binding comb, and causing them to be unwound, allowing the fingers (54) to be inserted into the apertures (48) of the packet. Movement of the drive plate (8) from its rest position causes the clamping member (16) to be moved to its advanced position, and then the operating member (36) to its advanced position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with improvements relating to binding 
machines, particularly of the kind for binding packets having a row of apertures 
or perforations adjacent to one side edge, by the use of and a binding element 
(conveniently termed a "comb") comprising a spine and a series of coiled, flexible 
fingers which may be located in the apertures of the packet, to bind the sheets of 
the packet together into book-like form. There is known from DE-A-2448082 a binding machine for use in 
binding packets provided with a row of apertures or perforations adjacent to one 
side edge by the use of a binding element comprising a spine and a series of 
coiled, flexible fingers which may be located in the apertures of the packet to bind 
the sheets of the packet together into book like form, said machine comprising 
clamping mechanism to clamp a binding element and an operating member to 
cause the fingers of the binding element to be uncoiled. Such a machine is 
hereinafter referred to as being of the kind specified. Difficulty is encountered in the provision of a machine of the kind 
specified, which will clamp the binding element and straighten the fingers to allow 
them to be inserted into the apertures of a stack in a simple and convenient 
manner. According to this invention a binding machine of the kind specified is 
characterised by the feature, that the machine comprises a single drive mechanism 
to operate both the operating mechanism and the clamping mechanism, the 
clamping mechanism being moved to its operative position prior to movement of 
the operating member to so uncoil the fingers of the binding element. Preferably the drive mechanism comprises a drive member which is 
moveable from an inoperative position to a first operative position, and from said 
first operative position to a second operative position, movement of the drive 
member to said first operative position causing the clamping mechanism to clamp 
a binding element supported in the machine, and movement of said drive member  
 
from said first operative position to said second operative position causing the 
operating member to uncoil the fingers of the binding element, the drive 
mechanism also comprising means for moving said drive member from said 
inoperative position through said first operative position to said second operative 
position. Advantageously the clamping mechanism comprises clamping elements 
urged by the action of spring means into engagement with fixed abutment 
elements, the construction and arrangement

<CLAIMS>
A binding machine for binding packets (46) provided with a row of 
apertures or perforations (48) adjacent to one side edge, by the use of a binding 

element (50) comprising a spine (52) and a series of coiled, flexible fingers (54) 
which may be located in the apertures (48) of a packet (46) to bind the sheets of 

the packet together into book-like form, the machine comprising clamping 
mechanism (24, 28) to clamp a binding element (50), and an operating member 

(36) to cause the fingers (54) of the binding element to be uncoiled, characterised 
in that the machine comprises a single drive mechanism (8, 10, 12, 22, 29, 40) to 

operate both the operating member and the clamping mechanism, the clamping 
mechanism (24, 28) being moved to an operative position prior to movement of 

the operating member (36) to so uncoil the fingers of the binding element (50). 
A binding machine according to claim 1 further characterised in that 
the drive mechanism comprises a drive member (8) moveable from an inoperative 

position to a first operative position, and from said first operative position to a 
second operative position, movement of the drive member to said first operative 

position causing the clamping mechanism (24, 25) to clamp a binding element 
supported in the machine, and movement of said drive member (8) from said first 

operative position to said second operative position causing the operating member 
(36) to uncoil the fingers (54) of the binding element, the drive mechanism also 

comprising means (10, 12, 13) for moving said drive member from said inoperative 
position through said first operative position to said second operative position. 
A binding machine according to one of Claims 1 and 2 wherein the 
clamping mechanism comprises clamping elements (24) operative to clamp the 

binding element (50) at a plurality of spaced positions, said positions being spaced 
a distance equal to the spacing between the fingers (54) of the binding element  

 
(50), said clamping element (24) being urged by the action of spring means (22) 

into engagement with fixed abutment elements (28), and wherein in consequence 
of the movement of the drive member (8) to its inoperative position, the clamping 

elements (24) are moved into positions in which they are spaced from the fixed 
abutment elements (28). 
A clamping machine according to any one of the preceding claims 
wherein the operating member (36) comprises a plurality of fingers (38), and on 

movement of the operating member to an advanced position, said fingers (38)

fingers (54) of the binding element, and then longitudinally to uncoil the fingers 

preparatory to insertion of the fingers into the apertures (48) of the packet to be 
bound.

comprises a longitudinal portion (38
a
) and a transverse portion (38
b
), lateral
