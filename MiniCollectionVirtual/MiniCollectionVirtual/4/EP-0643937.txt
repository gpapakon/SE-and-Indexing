<ABSTRACT>
In a shelving system, receiving strips (3, 4) are attached in the rear region of mutually facing walls (1, 2) and have receiving parts (5) one above the other. These receiving parts (5) receive flat supports (6), in a releasable manner, which are attached to the end faces of shelves (7, 8) facing the walls (1, 2) and are therefore secured by these shelves (7, 8) against coming out of the receiving part (5) laterally.
