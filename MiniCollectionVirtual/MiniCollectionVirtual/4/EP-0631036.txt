<ABSTRACT>
The slave piston drive train in a compression 
release engine braking system includes a slave piston (30) 

with a rigidly connected extension. The end of the 
extension (34) remote from the main body (32) of the slave piston 

is spherically convex. A bearing pad or foot (40) fits in 
swivel fashion on this spherically convex end. The 

outer surface of the foot opposite the spherically 
convex extension end is substantially flat and bears on 

a substantially flat surface on an exhaust valve rocker 
arm (50).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compression release
engine brakes, and more particularly to improved
structures for coupling the slave pistons in such
engine brakes to the exhaust valves in the associated
internal combustion engine.Compression release engine brakes or
retarders are well known as shown, for example, by
Jakuba et al. U.S. patent 4,473,047. Such devices
typically operate by opening an exhaust valve in a
cylinder in the internal combustion engine associated
with the brake near top dead center of the compression
stroke of that cylinder. This releases gas compressed
during the compression stroke and prevents the work of
compression from being recovered during the subsequent
"power" stroke of the cylinder. In effect, the engine
brake, while it is on, converts the engine from a power
source to a power consuming gas compressor. This power
consumption enables the engine to help slow down the
associated vehicle, thereby saving wear on the
vehicle's normal wheel brakes. Other examples of mechanisms that may produce engine
braking are shown in international applications WO 91/08381
and WO 94/25740. The first of these references shows a
hydraulic mechanism mounted on an engine rocker arm for
selectively taking up clearance between the rocker arm and
the cross-head of associated engine cylinder valves. The
second of these references shows a selectively operable
hydraulic circuit mounted on an engine rocker arm.US 5165375 discloses an improved master piston
assembly of simplified construction for use in a compression
release engine retarder.The typical compression release engine brake produces
the exhaust valve openings described above by using a
hydraulic circuit to pick up an appropriately timed motion
from another part of the engine and to 
transfer that motion to the exhaust valve to be opened.
A master piston in this hydraulic circuit receives the
mechanical input from the engine. The hydraulic
circuit transmits that input to a slave piston in the
circuit. The slave piston moves in response to the
transmitted input, thereby producing a mechanical
output which is coupled to the exhaust valve in order
to open that valve.The force which must be transmitted from the
slave piston to the exhaust valve is typically quite
high. This has made it necessary to give careful
attention to the design of the drive train between the
slave piston and the associated exhaust valve or
valves. It is known to have the slave piston contact
the end of the exhaust valve stem, the exhaust valve
bridge (where there are two exhaust

Compression release engine braking
system comprising an apparatus for transmitting force

and motion from a hydraulic circuit (22, 24) in a
compression release engine brake to open an exhaust

valve in an internal combustion engine associated with
the engine brake including a slave piston (30) disposed

in contact with said hydraulic circuit (24) for
reciprocation along a first axis (26), said slave

piston (30) having a main body (32) and an extension
(34) extending from said main body (32) parallel to

said first axis (26) in a direction away from said
hydraulic circuit (24), the end of said extension (34)

which faces away from said main body (32) being
substantially spherically convex; a bearing pad (40)

rotatably secured to said spherically convex end of
said extension (34), said bearing pad (40) having a

spherically concave inner surface which is
substantially concentric with said spherically convex

end received in said inner surface, and a substantially
flat outer surface (42) opposite said inner surface;

and an exhaust valve rocker arm (50) mounted for
oscillation about a shaft (60) in a first plane which

is perpendicular to said shaft (60), said rocker arm
(50) having a substantially flat bearing surface (52)

which is substantially perpendicular to said first
plane and to said first axis (26) and which is radially

spaced from said shaft (60), said outer surface (42)
bearing on said bearing surface (52) in order to cause

reciprocation of said slave piston (30) to oscillate
said rocker arm (50) and thereby open an exhaust valve

controlled by said rocker arm (50), characterised in
that said extension (34) is rigidly attached to said

main body (32).
