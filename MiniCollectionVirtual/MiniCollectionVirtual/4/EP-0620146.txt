A shopping trolley comprises an undercarriage (1), a goods container (2) mounted thereon and a rack, in particular for crates of drinks. The rack may assume an in-use position and a not-in-use position and includes a swivel part (14) which can be swivelled about a horizontal, transversely running axis (13) and has a deposit-surface portion (20) and a stop (22), which is provided at a distance from the swivelling axis. The rack includes a rigid support part (6) which has a deposit-surface portion (10) to which the swivel part (14) is coupled. In the in-use position of the rack, the deposit-surface portion (20) of the swivel part (14) extends that of the support part (6).
