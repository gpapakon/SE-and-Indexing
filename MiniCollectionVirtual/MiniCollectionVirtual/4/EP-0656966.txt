<ABSTRACT>
Treatment of process water containing metal ions, in connection with the bleaching of pulp of lignocellulose-containing material. The process water is brought into contact with pulp at pH above 7 and a temperature of 50-120  C. The process thereby is relieved entirely or partially from the metal ion content.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of treating 
process water, which contains metal ions, in connection with 
the bleaching of pulp of lignocellulose-containing material. 
In order to minimize the effect by various emissions, such as BOD, COD, paint etc. on the environment, there is a 
strong interest to restrict the emissions by closing the 
wastewater system of the bleach plants. This implies, that 
the wastewater should be recycled to the process instead of 
being emitted. As a result of closing the system, however, 
the content of metal ions, such as manganese, copper, iron 
etc. in the system can increase to a level giving rise to 
problems at bleaching with hydrogen peroxide and, 
respectively, ozone. The metal ions enter the system via the wood raw 
material and therefore, the affluent of metal ions cannot be 
eliminated as would be desirable from a process point of 
view. The content of these metal ions in the pulp, however, 
is very low and, therefore, they do not cause any environmental 
problem, not in the local working environment and not 
in the recipient, either. In future, the bleaching of papermaking pulp will be 
based to a high degree on hydrogen peroxide bleaching and 
ozone bleaching. For achieving high ISO-brigthness, this type 
of bleaching requires the unbleached pulp and process water 
to be free, or substantially free, of certain metal ions, 
because otherwise a considerable disintegration of charged 
hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen and, respectively, of 
charged ozone to oxygen will take place, without any 
simultaneous bleaching effect. In order to remove the metal ions prior to bleaching, 
the pulp must be pretreated with chemicals, for example acid 
or complex formers such as EDTA or DTPA, which selectively 
bind the undesired metal ions and thereby render it possible 
to wash them out prior to the bleaching. For process reasons, 
the resulting washing water must be eliminated from the 
system, and at the same time environmental reasons require 
that the washing water is not emitted.  
 According to SE, A, 80 01839 mechanical pulp is 
bleached with peroxide. Prior to the bleaching complex formed 
trace metals are washed out from the pulp by means of a 
washing liquid. This washing liquid is then treated with an 
ion exchanging resin which removes the complex formed trace 
metals. Then the ion exchanger has to be eluated and the 
eluate destructed. This method is both complicated and 
expensive and would cause environmental problems. According to EP, A1, 456 626
