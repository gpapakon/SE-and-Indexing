<ABSTRACT>
In a ground fault circuit interrupter (1) in which it was found that wide band 
noise induced by load transients is rectified by an op-amp (83) in the detector circuit, false 

trips due to the wide band noise are eliminated by only comparing the output of the amplifier 
with a threshold of opposite polarity to that of the rectified noise signal and by eliminating 

capacitive coupling between the current sensor and the op amp. This requires an op amp with 
a low offset, on the order of about five percent or less.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to circuit interrupters which respond to ground 
faults and in particular to such circuit interrupters with immunity to false tripping 
caused by transients such as wide band noise induced by load related switching 
phenomenon. Ground fault interrupters include ground fault circuit breakers, ground 
fault receptacles, and even cord mounted ground fault protection devices. Ground 
fault interrupters may be troubled by false tripping, even though they pass all 
present industry standards. One cause of false tripping is disconnection of the 
power to inductive appliances, particularly by unplugging the appliances. Examples of these appliances include electric shavers, high intensity 
lamps, and small cooling fans, such as are used for cooling electronic equipment. 
Unplugging these appliances generates an arc between the plug and the receptacle, 
resulting in the superimposition of several volts of wide band noise onto the power 
line. Due to the wide band nature of the noise, even a very small stray coupling 
capacitance will couple the noise from the power line conductor into the ground 
fault circuit, causing a false trip. A typical ground fault interrupter includes an operational amplifier 
which amplifies the sensed ground fault signal and applies the amplified signal to 
a window comparator which compares it to positive and negative reference signals.  
 
If either reference value is exceeded, a trip signal is generated. A common type of 
ground fault detection circuit is the dormant oscillator detector. This detector 
includes a first sensor coil through which the line and neutral conductors of the 
protected circuit pass. The output of the first sensor coil is applied through a 
coupling capacitor to the above-described operational amplifier followed by a 
window comparator. A line-to-ground fault causes the amplified signal to exceed 
the reference value and generates a trip signal. The dormant oscillator ground fault detector includes a second sensor 
coil through which only the neutral conductor passes. A neutral-to-ground fault 
couples the two detector coils causing the amplifier to oscillate which also results 
in generation of a trip signal. It has been found that wide band noise induced by load related 
switching phenomena such as is caused by unplugging inductive appliances causes 
false tripping of the ground fault interrupter. Commonly owned U.S. patent application serial no. 023,435 filed on 
February 26, 1993 discloses a ground fault circuit interrupter of the
