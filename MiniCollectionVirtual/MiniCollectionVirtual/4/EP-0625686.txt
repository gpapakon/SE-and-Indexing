<ABSTRACT>
The objects of the present invention are to facilitate 
the mounting of the expansion valve by achieving a simple 

structure, to achieve space saving and to achieve an improvement 
in the heat exchanging capacity with a structure 

in which the intake / outlet passage forming plate (4b) that is 
provided with an entrance / exit section (28) onto which the 

expansion valve is mounted, a first coolant passage (33) that 
communicates between one side of the intake / outlet section (4b) 

and one end of the coolant path (18) and a second coolant passage (35) 
that connects the other side of the intake / outlet section (4b) 

and the other end of the coolant path (18) via a communicating 
pipe (24), is bonded into one of the end plates. With this structure, 

the shapes of the first and second coolant passages (33,35) in 
the intake / outlet passage forming plate (4b) can be changed, 

making it possible to have the entrance / exit section (28), onto 
which the expansion valve is mounted, communicate freely 

with the outflow / inflow sides of the coolant path. Also, 
by providing a plurality of tanks (46,48,52,54,56) to 

communicate between 
the communicating pipe and the tank groups at one end of the 

coolant path and, by changing the communicating positions, 
improve the heat exchanging capacity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laminated heat exchanger
that is used for automotive air conditioning
systems, in particular, a laminated heat exchanger which is
structured by laminating a plurality of heat exchanging
elements, each of which is provided with a pair of tanks
that communicate with each other through a U-shaped passage,
together with a plurality of corrugated fins.In recent years, depending upon the layout of the engine
compartment of the vehicle, it is often the case that positioning
the entry pipe or the expansion valve at the tank in
the lower section of the heat exchanger creates a hindrance.
To deal with this problem, the entry pipe is not normally
led out at the end plate side of the heat exchanger, rather,
it is led out at the front of the heat exchanger and the
piping is implemented at a specific height by leading the
pipe around.However, with this method, the problem of reduced cooling
capacity is likely to arise, as the ventilating resistance
is increased by the entry pipe, the expansion valve
which is connected to the entry pipe, and the like. In order
to eliminate this problem, the heat exchanger disclosed in
Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication 3-170755 has an entry
pipe located on the surface on the side. This example makes it possible to provide an entry
pipe on one side by forming a central tank group or a
pipe between a pair of tanks when structuring a coolant
path with four or more routes.However, in the example described above, since the
pitch of the entrance to the expansion valve and the
pitch of the heat exchanger entrance do not match, a
space for mounting the expansion valve is required.
Also, as it is necessary to manoeuvre the entry pipe to
this space, no space saving can be realised. Another
problem is that the number of components increases.In our US-A-5024269 there is disclosed a laminated
heat exchanger suitable for use in automobile air-conditioning
systems including a plurality of heat
exchanger elements laminated together, each having a pair
of tanks on one side thereof connected by a U-shaped
channel, with the heat exchanger elements communicating
with each other so as to form a flow passage. Inlet and
outlet pipes are disposed in juxtaposition on one side of
the laminated heat exchanger.The object of the present invention is to provide a
laminated heat exchanger with a simple structure which
facilitates the mounting of an expansion valve so as to
achieve space saving and which also realises an
improvement in heat exchanging capability.In order to
