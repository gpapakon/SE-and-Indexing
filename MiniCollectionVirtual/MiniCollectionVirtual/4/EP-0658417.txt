<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the corrosion-resistant lining of an article consisting of metal, in particular steel, such as a tank (container), pipeline or the like, in which a layer of rubber is applied to the surface to be used of the article and subsequently a covering layer of thermoplastic films is adhesively attached on this layer. To achieve the effect that the thermoplastic films can be adhesively attached onto the rubber layer without any problems and that blistering is avoided, the thermoplastic films consist of a fluorothermoplastic and expansion joints are formed when they are adhesively attached onto the layer of rubber.

<CLAIMS>
Method for the corrosion-resistant lining of a component, such as a container,
pipeline or the like, consisting of metal, in particular steel, in which a layer of

rubber is applied to the working surface of the component and then an outer layer
of thermoplastic films is glued on to this layer, characterised in that the

thermoplastic films consist of 0.1 mm - 1.0 mm thick polytetrafluoroethylene films
etched on the adhesive side with a maximum edge length of 3000 mm which are

glued on to the layer of rubber by means of a contact adhesive based on
polychloroprene/polyisocyanate, thereby forming expansion joints, the expansion

joints being filled with a jointing filler.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the polytetrafluoroethylene films
have a thickness of 0.25 mm to 0.50 mm.
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that the jointing filler has a glass
transition temperature of less than 20Â°C.
