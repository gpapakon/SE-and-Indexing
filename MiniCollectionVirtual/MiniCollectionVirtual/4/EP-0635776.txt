<ABSTRACT>
To reduce the number of parts and improve the efficient use of 
space without adversely effecting the operation of the cover. 
A latch mechanism which engages with a main body 12 is provided at 
pivoting edges of a keyboard 20 and a cover 16 which are provided at the 

main body 12 so as to be openable and closable. The latch mechanism 
includes a latch member 26A (or 26B) which is movable from a first 

position, at which the cover 16 and the keyboard 20 are engaged with the 
main body 12, to a second position, at which the engaged state of the 

cover 16 and the keyboard 20 with the main body 12 is released. The 
latch member 26A releases only the engaged state
 of the main body 12 and 
the cover 16 at a third position which is between the first position and 

the second position. Further, the latch member 26A is usually urged to 
the first position by a compression coil spring 36A which deforms 

upwardly in a convex shape at the second position of the latch member 
26A.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to lock apparatus which is suitable 
for a small computer or the like such as a notebook-type personal 
computer. In conventional structures having a cover, generally, a cover is 
disposed relative to a substantially box-shaped main body so as to pivot 
around an edge portion of the cover so as to be openable and closable. A 
compression coil spring which usually urges the cover in a direction of 
opening is interposed between the cover and the main body. In this type 
of structure having a cover, the main body and the cover are engaged by a 
latch mechanism which includes a latch member which can return to an 
original position. When the latch member of such a structure is released from an 
engaged state with the main body the cover is released, and the cover is 
pivoted in the direction of opening due to the urging force of the 
compression coil spring. As the uses of small computers, such as lap-top type personal 
computers, notebook-type personal computers, and the like, have 
diversified, the need to expand various functions of such computers has 
increased. In light of these circumstances, various structures have been 
proposed. Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open No. 3-54027 
discloses a personal computer comprising a keyboard provided so as to be 
freely attachable to and removable from a device main body; and an 
expansion unit mounting mechanism which is provided so as to be exposed 
at an open surface of a keyboard mounting portion of the device main 
body. Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open No. 4-36623 discloses 
a display-integrated-type computer in which a keyboard is mounted to a 
main body so as to be freely openable and closable, the 
display-integrated-type computer having a connector to which an option 
board is connected and which is provided in a board mounting space which 
is formed under the keyboard. In conventional structures having a cover, in addition to the 
various parts forming the latch mechanism, there is also a need for a  
 
compression coil spring to push up the cover, which leads to a drawback 
in that space is required for said various parts. Further, when a 
structure similar to these structures having a cover is used in a small 
electronic device such as a notebook-type personal computer or the like, 
difficulties arise with respect to weight and size. Due to the personal computer disclosed in above-mentioned Japanese 
Utility Model Application Laid-Open No. 3-54027 being structured such 
that the keyboard is freely

<CLAIMS>
Lock apparatus for locking together pivotally connected first (12) 
and second (16) members, said lock apparatus comprising 

a latch member (26A) movable between an engaged position, in which the 
latch member (26A) locks together the first (12) and second (16) members, 

and a released position, in which the first and second members are free 
to pivot with respect to one another; and 

bias means (36A) arranged to deform in response to movement of the latch 
member (26A) towards the release position so as to urge the second member 

(16) in an opening direction. 
Lock apparatus for locking a first member (12) to at least one of 
either a second member (16) or a third member (20), the second (16) and 

third (20) members (20) being pivotally connected to the first member 
(12), said lock apparatus comprising 

latch means (26A) for locking the second member (16) and the third member 
(20) to the first member (12). 
Lock apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein 
the latch member (26A) is movable between a first engaged position, in 

which the latch member (26A) locks together the first (12) and second 
(16) members, and a first released position, in which the first and 

second members are free to pivot with respect to one another, and 
the latch member (26A) is movable between the first engaged position, in 

which the latch member (26A) locks together the first (12) and third (20) 
members, and a second release position, in which the first and third 

members are free to pivot with respect to one another. 
Lock apparatus as claimed in either of claims 2 or 3, wherein said 
third member (20) is a keyboard of a portable computing apparatus. 
Lock apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein said first 
(12) and second (16) members are respectively a main body and a cover of 

a portable computing apparatus. 
Portable computing apparatus comprising lock apparatus as claimed in 
any preceding claim, wherein said first (12), second (16) and third (20) 

members are respectively the main body, the cover and the keyboard of 
said portable computing apparatus.
