<ABSTRACT>
The system for automatically loading and 
unloading bottles, vials, or other containers (16) into 

and out of a freeze dryer (22) or other material 
treating apparatus includes a loading station (12) and a 

conveyer (40) for bringing bottles (16) to the loading 
station (12). A transfer vehicle (18) movable between 

the loading station (12) and one or more freeze dryers 
(22-26) includes a horizontally arranged platen (20) for 

supporting an entire dryer shelf of bottles. When the 
vehicle (18) is aligned with the loading station (12), a 

pusher bar (44) slides bottles from the loading station 
onto the vehicle platen (20). The vehicle (18) then 

moves to a dryer (22) where the platen (20) aligns 
itself with one of the dryer shelves. A guide bar (50) 

at the rear end of a rectangularly shaped lasso or 
transfer cage (46) moves forwardly pushing the bottles 

(16) onto the shelf (62). The forward end of the cage 
(46) is then raised above the height of the bottles and 

removed from the dryer. To unload a dryer shelf, the 
cage (46) enters the dryer (22) above the bottles (16) 

and the forward end drops down behind them. The bottles 
(16) are then drawn out from the shelf onto the vehicle 

platen (20) by the cage (46). Thereafter, the vehicle 
(18) is moved to an unloading station (28) where an 

unloading transfer guide at the forward end of the 
vehicle (18) moves rearwardly to push the bottles (16) 

from the platen (20) onto an unloading conveyer (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed toward a system 
for loading and unloading bottles, vials or other similar 
containers into and out of a freeze dryer, oven, autoclave 
or other material treating apparatus and, more 
particularly, to such a system which can automatically load 
or unload an entire shelf of bottles or other containers 
without manual assistance. Freeze dryers, sometimes referred to as 
lyophilization autoclaves, are widely used in the 
pharmaceutical industry for desiccating pharmaceuticals in 
bottles and sealing the bottles. Conventional freeze dryers 
include a plurality of vertically movable shelves. When the 
dryer is empty, all of the shelves are in the lowermost 
position and a tray of bottles is manually loaded onto the 
uppermost shelf. Conventionally, this is accomplished by 
the use of a three-sided tray which has the bottles on the 
upper surface thereof in aligned rows and columns. Normally a hoop surrounds all of the bottles on 
a tray in order to help maintain them in an upright 
position. The tray with the bottles thereon is placed on 
the shelf and is then manually slid outwardly so that all 
of the bottles and the hoop remain in the dryer. The shelf 
is then moved upwardly and the process is repeated with a 
second group of bottles being placed on the second shelf. 
As each shelf moves upwardly, it engages either the top of 
the dryer or the shelf above it to force the bottle 
stoppers down into the bottles in order to seal the same. The unloading of a freeze dryer shelf is 
conventionally done in substantially the same manner. That 
is, the lowermost shelf with the bottles thereon is lowered  
 
and a three-sided tray is slid under the bottles. The 
combined tray, bottles and hoop is then manually removed 
from the shelf. The foregoing conventional process is slow and 
labor intensive and is, accordingly, relatively expensive. 
It has been proposed to use a carriage assembly or the like 
for moving a plurality of bottles into the vicinity of a 
freeze dryer shelf so that the same can then be slid onto 
the shelf. One such system is shown, for example, in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,506,455. However, the system shown in that 
patent remains labor intensive. To Applicant's knowledge, no one heretofore has 
proposed an automatic system for loading and unloading 
bottles into and out of a freeze dryer without manual 
intervention. Such a system would, of course, greatly 
increase the speed of operation and reduce the costs 
involved. The present invention overcomes the problems of
