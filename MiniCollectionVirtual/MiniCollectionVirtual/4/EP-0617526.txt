<ABSTRACT>
For use in a coherent optic switch a coherent optical transceiver has a single 
coherent receiver for both data recovery and to lock the transmitter to an optical reference 

input to the receiver. The switch may include polarisation control of the optical input to 
the receiver and wave division multiplex control of the transmitter frequency. The 

transmitter and receiver may be constructed as opto-electronic integrated circuits.

<DESCRIPTION>
An Opto-Electronic Integrated Circuit (OEIC) is described such as may be used in
Coherent Optical Switch (COS) systems, for example as described in co-pending
application No. GB 9220592.1 now patent number GB 2271235B entitled "Optic
Switching". The OEIC greatly simplifies the coherent transceivers used to construct large
port count optical switches based on coherent optical transmission. The OEIC also has the
potential to be used in any coherent based optical transmission system requiring a
transceiver function, not just coherent based switches.In existing coherent based optical communication systems two lasers are required,
one used as the coherent transmitter, the other being used as the local oscillator within the
coherent receiver. The local oscillator is used as in a radio super-heterodyne receiver to
tune into the coherent transmission channel. In multi-channel systems the local oscillator
is used to select one of the many channels being simultaneously transmitted. Both the
channel frequency and the inter-channel spacing of the transmitted channels need to be
accurately controlled and stabilised.The selectivity of coherent systems allows the formation of a switching function.
A signal is transmitted on a given coherent channel. The 'switching' function is performed
by the destination port (coherent receiver) tuning into this source.Some switch designs require a fully distributed switch architecture in which
transmitter and receiver nodes can be located anywhere. In some architectures each
transmitter and receiver pair are required to be located together. A realistic means of
wavelength management of the transmitter laser is by use of an optical reference generated 
by a central management unit and fed to the transmitter via the same optical fibre link. This
optical reference is tuned to the optical frequency of the transmitter it is controlling. A
proportion of the transmitter signal power is used to act as a 'local oscillator' and is mixed
with the optical reference in the photodetectors to produce an electrical Intermediate
Frequency (IF). Thus, using Automatic Frequency Control (AFC) techniques the transmit
laser can be 'locked' to this optical reference at a certain frequency 'offset'.The optical reference can either be present always or the transmitter laser be left to
'free run', being 'nudged' back onto channel at set intervals. A further technique uses a
direct detection link to transmit frequency correction information derived by a optical
frequency monitor unit co-located with the
