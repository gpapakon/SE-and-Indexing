<CLAIMS>
Device for evacuating toward the exterior of a wall
moisture contained on the back of said wall within a room or

a living space, of the type comprising a condenser,
characterized in that said device includes two cavities (4)

and (4A) used as siphons and having a recess (H) in their
seat to accommodate in tilted fashion a watertight junction

duct (3), and also includes a condenser (1,1') formed as a
heat-conducting rod lying in said watertight duct (3) and

outwardly sloping while allowing for a venting channel, and
in that a thin plate (5,5',5") made of a porous material and

used as an evaporator is clamped on the bottom part of said
rod.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said
rod (1) is solid, and that its overall diameter is less than

the inside diameter of said duct (3) so as to allow for a
peripheral venting channel.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said
rod (1) is formed as a tube whose overall diameter

substantially matches the internal diameter of said duct (3)
and whose central bore (7) defines said venting channel.
Device according to claim 12, characterized in that said
plate used as an evaporator (5') has peripheral apertures

(6') which are substantially tangent to the circumference of
said rod (1).
Device according to claim 13, characterized in that said
plate used as an evaporator (5) has a central hole (6)

matching the internal diameter of said bore in rod (1).
Device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that it further includes a bit (M) lying

adjacent the venting channel, for instance between said rod
(1) and said duct (3), or within said bore (7) in tube-formed

rod (1). 
Device according to claim 6 combined with any of claims
1, 2 or 3, characterized in that said bit (M) has a tip

protruding adjacent the bottom of said rod (1) and used as an
evaporator.
Device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that grids (8) are provided for fitting on

the apertures of said cavities used as siphons (4) and (4A).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said
cavities used as siphons (4) and (4A) are provided with a

flange (F) having plane elements arranged on its rear for
accommodating fixing screws and between which lies a

connecting sleeve (H) to duct (3).
