<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for suppressing pointer phase jitter in a desynchronizer comprising a data buffer means (1); a write address counter (2) controlled by a write clock (CLK1); a read address counter (3) controlled by a read clock (CLK2); and a phase-locked loop (4, 5, 7) for phase-locking the read clock to the write clock. The method according to the invention comprises modulating (61, 64) the pointer phase jitter to a frequency substantially higher than the bandwidth of the phase-locked loop.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for suppressing
pointer phase jitter in a desynchronizer comprising
a data buffer means; a data buffer write address
counter controlled by a write clock; a data buffer
read address counter controlled by a read clock; and
a phase-locked loop for phase-locking the read clock
to the write clock.The CCITT recommendations G.707, G.708 and
G.709 specify a synchronous digital hierarchy SDH,
which enables the multiplexing of the signals of
existing PCM systems, such as 2, 8, 34 and 140
Mbit/s, into a synchronous frame of 155 Mbit/s called
STM-1 (synchronous transfer module). The structure of
the STM-1 frame is illustrated in Figure 1. The frame
is usually shown as a unit comprising nine lines each
having 270 bytes. The first nine bytes on each line
contain a section overhead and AU pointer bytes. The
remaining portion of the transfer frame STM-1 contains
one or more administration units AU. In this
specific case, there is an administration unit AU-4
of the highest level, in which a virtual container
VC-4 similarly of the highest level is placed, and
e.g. a 139264 kbit/s plesiochronous information
signal can be mapped directly in the virtual container
VC-4. Alternatively, the transfer frame STM-1
may contain several lower-level administration units
AU in each one of which a corresponding virtual container
VC of the lowest level is placed. In Figure 1,
the VC-4 comprises a 1-byte path overhead POH and a 
240-byte information bit group at the start of both of
which a special control byte is placed. Some of the
control bytes are used e.g. for performing interface
justification in connection with mapping when the rate
of the information signal to be mapped deviates to some
extent from its nominal value. Mapping of the
information signal into the transfer frame STM-1 is
described e.g. in the patent applications AU-B-34639/89
and FI-914746.Each byte in the unit AU-4 has a position number.
The above-mentioned AU pointer contains the position of
the first byte of the container VC-4 in the unit AU-4.
In addition, by means of the pointers, so-called
positive or negative pointer justifications can be
performed at the different locations of the SDH network.
If a VC having a certain clock frequency is applied to a
network node operating at a clock frequency lower than
the above-mentioned clock frequency of the VC, the data
buffer will be filled up. This requires negative
justification: one byte is transferred from the received
VC into the overhead section while the pointer value is
decreased
