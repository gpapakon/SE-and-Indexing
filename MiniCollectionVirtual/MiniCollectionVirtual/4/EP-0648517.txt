<ABSTRACT>
A multi-component, lightweight field hockey stick 
comprising a plastic head section (20) and a handle (12) 

fitted into the head section (40) is described. The head 
section (20) comprises a first flat surface (40, 42) 

including a flat ball-striking surface (42) and a surface 
(30, 32) opposite the ball-striking surface so configured 

to decrease weight and provide increased structural 
strength. The surface area opposite the ball-striking 

surface includes an area for receiving a resilient pad 
(24). The field hockey stick is particularly useful as a 

learning or introductory stick for inexperienced players.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a field hockey stick. More 
particularly, the invention relates to a lightweight 
field hockey stick which is easily constructed of 
relatively inexpensive components, making the stick 
particularly suitable as an introductory training stick 
or a stick for indoor play. Field hockey is an old and well-known sport with 
established rules and played in over one-hundred 
countries by women and men, and girls and boys. Although 
the game has certain established specifications for the 
field hockey stick used in play, the specifications are 
rather loosely defined. Moreover, in large part field 
hockey sticks are handmade primarily in countries where 
there is an abundance of hand labourers and where labour 
costs are low. As a result, it is often difficult to 
obtain sticks of uniform quality in a timely fashion. 
Further, the available sticks are all of a general 
similar construction whether for a first-time, 
inexperienced player or for a veteran player. Accordingly, there is substantial need for a field hockey  
 
stick design and method of construction whereby the field 
hockey sticks can be mass produced having essentially 
uniform qualities. There is a further need for a 
lightweight field hockey stick of substantially uniform 
quality with features similar to or the same as the 
features of a competitive field hockey stick which can be 
produced at relatively low cost and safe in the hands of 
first-time players as an introductory stick in order that 
the skills which an introductory player learns with the 
introductory stick can be immediately translated to the 
use of a competition stick. It is a primary object of the present invention to 
provide a lightweight field hockey stick which is easily 
constructed of relatively inexpensive components to 
provide a stick having features similar to or the same as 
the features of a competitive field hockey stick in order 
that the skills which an introductory player learns with 
the introductory stick can be immediately translated to 
the use of a competition stick, making the stick 
particularly suitable as a training or introductory stick 
for indoor or outdoor use. It is further object of the present invention to provide 
a field hockey stick having a design which permits 
variation in colour and hardness characteristics of the 
stick components to provide for enhanced team play and 
for modification in the playing characteristics of the 
stick depending upon the playing area and playing 
conditions. The present invention

<CLAIMS>
A field hockey stick characterised in that it 
comprises a plastic head section (20) and a handle 

(12) fitted into said head section (20), said head 
section comprising a first flat surface including a 

ball-striking surface (42); ball receiving surface 
(40) and a surface (30, 32) opposite said ball-striking 

surface so configured to decrease weight 
and provide increased structural strength, the 

surface area opposite said ball-striking surface 
constructed and arranged to prevent ball play. 
A field hockey stick according to Claim 1 
characterised in that said surface opposite said 

ball-striking surface has an area for receiving a 
pad (24). 
A field hockey stick according to Claim 1 or 2 
characterised in that said handle (12) is of 

aluminum and elliptical in shape.

1 to 4 characterised in that the configured surface 

(30, 32) comprises a plurality of longitudinal 
grooves (30) having horizontal ribs (32) in said 

grooves (30) for reducing weight and imparting 
increased structural strength.

2, or 3 to 5 when dependent on Claim 2, 

characterised in that said surface for receiving a 
pad (24) is a recess in said body section (20) and

adhesively secured within said recess. 
A field hockey stick according to Claim 6 
characterised in that said resilient material is a 

foam. 
A field hockey stick according to Claim 7 

characterised in that said foam pad (24) is a high-density 
polyethylene foam or a polyurethane foam. 
A field hockey stick according to any one of Claims 
1 to 8 characterised in that said plastic head 

section (20) is made of a high-density polyethylene 
or a high-density polypropylene. 
A field hockey stick according to any one of Claims 
1 to 9 characterised in that said handle (12) is 

replaceably secured within said head section (20).
