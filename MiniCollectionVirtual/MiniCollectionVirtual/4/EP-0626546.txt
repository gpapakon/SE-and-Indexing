<ABSTRACT>
The method and the device serve to raise the temprature of waste heat in order to generate available heat (useful heat) therefrom via heat transformation. To this end, an expeller (A), a condenser (K), an evaporator (V), a medium-pressure absorber (MA) and a high-pressure absorber (HA) are employed. The working-fluid condensate (@d) coming from the condenser (K) is divided into two branch streams (@d1,@d2), the one branch stream (@d2) evaporating in the evaporator (V) and being supplied to the primary side of the medium-pressure absorber (MA). At the same time, a rich solution (@r1) flows from the high-pressure absorber (HA) to the primary side of the medium-pressure absorber (MA) and absorbs the vapour (@d2) from the evaporator (V). The absorption heat produced is employed to evaporate the other branch stream (@d1) from the condenser (K), the vapour formed (@d1) then being supplied, together with the depleted (lean) solution (@a) from the expeller (A), to the high-pressure absorber (HA). As a result of the vapour (@d1) being absorbed by the depleted solution (@a) absorption heat is released at a higher temperature which e.g. is used to generate useful steam. In each case, the expeller (A) and the condenser (K), as well as the evaporator (V) and the medium-pressure absorber (MA) are accommodated in a single rectangular housing. The high-pressure absorber (HA) has a square cross-section.
