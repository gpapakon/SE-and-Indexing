<ABSTRACT>
A method for determining a beat frequency in a vibration 
sensing system attached to an electrical generator 

characterized by the steps of generating a vibration signal 
indicative of a vibrational frequency and amplitude of the 

generator; and obtaining a beat frequency from the vibration 
signal by storing and processing time interval data 

representing the time intervals between zero crossings of 
the vibration signal. A generator (10) optical vibration 

sensor (12) and computer (14) constitute the vibration 
sensing system (16). The computer is programmed to analyze 

the time interval data to obtain the beat frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
electrical generators, and more particularly to a system 
for monitoring the vibration of an electrical generator. U.S. Patent No. 5,146,776, September 15, 1992, 
titled Method for Continuously Calibrating an Optical 
Vibration Sensor, discloses a system for automatically 
calibrating a fiber optic vibration monitor (FOVM) employing 
a cantilever-mounted grid attached to a generator. The 
grid interrupts a light beam at a frequency directly 
proportional to the sensor's vibrational amplitude at a 
singular driving frequency (i.e., 120Hz). The patent 
teaches how troublesome conditions of the generator can be 
detected at an early stage by measuring the vibration 
amplitude of a generator end-winding. This allows maintenance 
to be scheduled to avoid damage to the generator and 
minimize down time. In sum, the system employs the amplitude of the 
signal at the "extrema" to determine the beat frequency. 
The extrema are the furthest points in the grid's motion as 
it oscillates about its equilibrium position. The largest 
wavelengths in the frequency modulated output signal (i.e., 
the points in the waveform where the zero crossings are 
spread apart the most) correspond to the extrema, since the 
extrema are where the grid comes momentarily to rest before 
reversing direction.  The present invention addresses the problem that 
occurs when the beat amplitude becomes large enough to 
cause a fold-over, distorting the beat frequency. This 
problem also occurs in connection with a small beat amplitude 
when the signal at the extrema occurs near the peak 
signal values. When fold-overs occur, they distort the 
beat signal determined from the extrema such that it 
becomes extremely difficult to determine the beat frequency, 
making it practically impossible to accurately determine 
the resonant frequency of the sensor. Moreover, the 
resonant frequency drifts (changes) with temperature and 
with age of the sensor. Therefore, one cannot assume that 
the resonant frequency of the sensor is whatever it was 
designed to be. It must be measured in the field, while 
the generator is operating. Accordingly, a primary object of the present 
invention is to provide a system for determining FOVM 
sensor beat frequency in environments with a high beat 
amplitude. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide such a system which will also determine FOVM sensor 
beat frequency in environments wherein the beat amplitude 
is small but the signal at the extrema occurs near
