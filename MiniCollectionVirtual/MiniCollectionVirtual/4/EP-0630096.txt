output shaft (11) for rotation therewith, the output 
shaft being mounted on a support member (10) for 

rotation, a magnetic body (4) disposed in concentric

distances around the periphery of the magnetic body,

adapted to be independent of one another, and

electromagnets which is positioned forwardly with 
regard to rotational direction of the rotational output 

shaft, so as to impart to the particular electromagnet 
a magnetic polarity opposite to that of the magnetic 

pole of the permanent magnet, whereby magnetic flux 
passing through the magnetic body converges in one 

direction so as to apply a rotational torque to the 
rotational output shaft. No force opposing movement of 

a rotor or movable element is generated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a motive power generating 
device in which electromagnets and a combination of a 
magnetic material and a permanent magnet are used as a 
stator and a rotator, respectively. More particularly, 
the invention relates to a motive power generating device 
which transforms magnetic energy into operative energy with 
maximum efficiency utilizing a magnetic force inherent in 
a permanent magnet as an energy source. Heretofore, it has been known in the art that a 
motive power generating device in which electromagnets and 
a combination of a magnetic material, such as soft steel, 
and a permanent magnet are used as a stator and a rotator, 
respectively. Such a device includes, for example, a step 
motor of a HB (Hybrid) type. Figs. 12 to 17 diagrammatically illustrate an example 
of conventional HB type step motors. The HB type motor is 
characterized by a rotor 52, as shown in Figs. 12 and 13. 
The rotor combines the advantageous feature of a step motor 
of a VR (Variable Reluctance) type in that a smaller step 
angle may be obtained by virtue of the teeth formed in 
a laminated steel plate 53 constituting one component of 
the rotor, with the advantageous feature of a step motor 
of a PM (Permanent Magnet) type in that a high degree of 
efficiency and miniaturization may be obtained by virtue 
of the permanent magnet 54 constituting the other component 
of the rotor 52. It is to be noted here that the steel core 
of the stator 50 is the same as that of a VR type motor, but 
the method of winding and connecting the coils is different. Fig. 14 shows a passage of magnetic flux (magnetic 
path) created by the permanent magnet 54. The magnetic 
path represents a distribution of a uni-polar type in which 
an N-pole or S-pole uniformly appears at the axial ends 
of a rotor shaft 55. On the other hand, Fig. 15 shows 
a magnetic path created by the electromagnets 51 of the  
 
rotor 50. The magnetic path represents a distribution of 
a hetero-polar type in which an even number of magnetic 
poles in the order, for example, of NSNS... appear in 
a plate vertical to the rotor shaft 55. The uni-polar 
magnetic flux of the permanent magnet (magnetic field of 
the permanent magnet) and the hetero-polar magnetic flux 
of the windings (magnetic field of the electromagnet) 
interact with each other so as to generate a torque. 
The term "interaction between the magnetic flux of the 
permanent magnet and the magnetic flux of the windings" 
is used herein to mean that an inclination of the line
