<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a fixing method for coils of electrically conductive materials, by impregnating with radically polymerizable compositions and thermal curing, in which the coils are impregnated by dipping, flooding, vacuum impregnating, vacumm pressure impregnating or dripping and are finally cured by high-energy radiation at the same time as or after the thermal curing. The method operates with a low energy requirement and a low emission of volatile substances. Also described are radically polymerizable compositions which can be used for the method.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the fixation of winding materials made of electrically conductive
materials by impregnation, the impregnation being carried out by immersion,

flooding, vacuum impregnation or vacuum pressure impregnation, with
substances which are polymerisable by a radical mechanism, and by thermal

curing, 
characterised in that
 the winding materials are Impregnated in a
preheated state with a substance which is polymerlsable by a radical

mechanism and which contains an adjuvant substance combination
comprising


A) one or more acyl phosphine oxides as photoinitiators,
B) one or more Initiators with labile C-C bonds and which respond to heat,
and
C) one or more stabilisers of the type comprising hydroquinones, quinones,
alkylphenols and/or alkylphenol ethers and are cured by high-energy

radiation simultaneously with or after thermal curing.
A process according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 thermal curing Is effected
by the application of electrical current to the windings of the winding materials.
A process according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 preheating is
effected by the application of electrical current to the windings of the winding

materials.
A process according to claim 3, 
characterised in that
 preheating is effected to
temperatures up to 180Â°C.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised In that
 curing of
the surface is effected with UV radiation or with an electron beam.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 windings
comprising electrically conducting wires are fixed as the winding materials. 
A process according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the
windings are heated additionally during impregnation.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 thermal
crosslinking is effected after impregnation.
