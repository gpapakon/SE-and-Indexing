<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
manufacturing a liquid discharge head for discharging
desired liquid by generating a bubble by acting thermal
energy on the liquid, such a liquid discharge head, a
head cartridge using such a liquid discharge head, and
a liquid discharging apparatus.Further, the present invention can be applied to
an apparatus such as a printer, a copying machine, a
facsimile having a communication system and a word
processor having a printer portion for effecting
recording with respect to a recording medium such as
paper, thread, fibers, cloth, leather, metal, plastic,
glass, wood or ceramics and the like, and an industrial
recording apparatus combined with various processing
devices in a composite manner.Incidentally, in this specification, the term
"recording" means not only that an image such as a
character or a figure is applied on a recording medium
but also that an image such as a pattern having no
meaning is applied to a recording medium.It is already known to provide an ink jet 
recording method (so-called bubble jet recording
method) in which change in condition including abrupt
volume change (generation of a bubble) is caused in ink
by applying thermal energy to the ink, and the ink is
discharged from a discharge port by an acting force
based on the condition change, thereby forming an image
by adhering the discharged ink onto a recording medium.
A recording apparatus using such a bubble jet recording
method generally includes discharge ports for
discharging the ink, ink passages communicated with the
discharge ports, and heat generating bodies
(electrothermal converting elements) as energy
generating means disposed in the ink passages and
adapted to discharge the ink, as disclosed in Japanese
Patent Publication Nos. 61-59911 and 61-59914.According to the above-mentioned recording method,
a high quality image can be recorded at a high speed
with low noise, and, in a head effecting such a
recording method, since the discharge ports for
discharging the ink can be arranged with high density,
a recorded image having high resolving power and a
color image can easily be obtained by a compact
apparatus. Thus, the bubble jet recording method has
recently been applied to various office equipments such
as printers, copying machines and facsimiles, and has
also been applied to industrial systems such as a print
apparatus. On the other hand, in the conventional bubble jet
recording methods, since the heat generating member is
heated repeatedly while contacting with the ink,
