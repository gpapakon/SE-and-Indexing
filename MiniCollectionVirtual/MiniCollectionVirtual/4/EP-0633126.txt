<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of 
protecting a pipe end. According to the 

invention, a film (2) covering the pipe 
end is attached to the end surface of the 

pipe (6) by welding or other similar 
sealing method.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of protecting a pipe end.It is known to protect pipe ends by means of end plugs passed
over the pipe ends or pushed inside the pipes on delivery from
the factory to the customer. Such plugs are usually made of
polyethylene or foamed polystyrene. The purpose of the plugs
is to keep the pipes clean up to the installation. This is
especially important in pressure pipes to be connected to
sensitive equipment and having high hygiene requirements.A drawback of known plugs is that the plugs are separate and
may be installed at the factory only after a long factory
storage time, in addition to which they tend to come off when
exposed to wind during transport. Moreover, the plugs are
expensive and cannot be returned from the installation site
for practical reasons.US-A-3 078 879
which forms the basis for the preamble of Claim 1,
refers to a closure which is suitable to avoid
contamination. However, the closure known from this document
does not allow an end surface protection such at is not
suitable as a replacement for the above mentioned plugs.The object of the present invention is to provide a method by
means of which pipes can be protected easily and
advantageously.The method according to the invention is characterized by the
features given in claim 1. Other preferred embodiments of the
invention are characterized by what is disclosed in the
accompanying claims.In the following the invention will be described by means of
an example with reference to the attached drawings, in which
Figure 1 shows a pipe end provided with a protective film by
the method according to the 
invention;Figure 2 shows a protective film web; andFigure 3 shows one practical application of the
method of forming and sealing a protective film
according to the invention.As shown in Figure 1, an end 1 of a pipe 6 is
provided with a protective film 2 in accordance with
the invention. The film 2 is heat sealed to the end
surface of the pipe in such a way that it can be torn
off before the installation of the pipe in a pipeline.
As used in this connection, the end surface of
the pipe 6 refers to the cutting surface of the pipe
end 1, which is in a plane perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis of the pipe. The end surface may
also be the end surface of a socket formed in the
pipe end or a piece attached to the pipe, as shown in
Figure 3.In place of inductive heat sealing, it is
possible to use e.g. ultrasonic welding. To
facilitate tearing, the film comprises a free edge 3
which can be gripped to tear off the

<CLAIMS>
Method of protecting a pipe end, wherein a film (2; 5a;
5b) covering the pipe end is attached to the end surface of

the pipe (6) by welding or other similar heat sealing method,
characterized in that the film (2; 5a; 5b) covering the pipe

end is formed from a laminate comprising at least one film
layer preventing the splitting of the film when being torn

off, and at least one layer sealable or weldable to the pipe
material. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the
film covering the end of the pipe (6) is formed from a film

web (4; 7) in which a pattern (5a; 5b) corresponding to the
shape of the pipe end is perforated, which pattern is detached

from the film web in connection with the sealing.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the film (2; 5a; 5b) is positioned eccentrically or is so

shaped relative to the pipe end (1) that a free edge (3) remains

after sealing, by which edge the film can be torn off.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the sealing is carried out in such a way that the film

(2; 5a; 5b) is easily detachable when installing the pipe. 
Method according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the film (2; 5a; 5b) covering the pipe end is sealed

to the pipe before the pipe leaves the production line.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the film (2; 5a; 5b) is sealed to the end surface of a

socket (14) or other similar connecting piece preinstalled to
the pipe (6).
