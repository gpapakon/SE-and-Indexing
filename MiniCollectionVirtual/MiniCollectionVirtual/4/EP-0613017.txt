<ABSTRACT>
Optical device for measuring the electrical intensity of a current flowing through a conductor, comprising a ring of glass or other transparent material furnished with an opening to allow the said conductor through, and with at least partially bevelled edges to allow a light beam entering the ring through a given edge to make one complete revolution around the opening before emerging from the ring, characterised in that the ring (10) includes one or more cavities (20, 21) arranged in the light path and in which are fixed a polariser (23), an analyser (24) and optical fibre connectors.

An optical device having a ring of glass or of some other
transparent material and serving to measure an electric current

flowing along a conductor, said device including a one-piece ring
(10) provided with an opening (11) through which said conductor can

pass, and with bevelled surfaces (13A, 14A, 15A, 16A) to enable a
light beam entering the ring via a given edge (20A) to make at least

one full turn around the opening (11) before it leaves the ring, the
device further including a polarizer (23), an analyzer (24), and

optical-fiber end-pieces (32, 33), said device being characterized in
that the polarizer (23), the analyzer (24), and the optical-fiber

end-pieces (32, 33) are supported and fixed by means of a flexible
glue in one or more cavities (20, 21) machined in the ring itself,

the light beam not passing through the glue.
An optical device according to claim 1, characterized in that the
one or more cavities (20, 21) contain a dry gas and are closed in

gastight manner by covers (20C, 21C).
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
bevelled surfaces (13A, 14A, 15A, 16A) are provided with caps (22)

closed in gastight manner and containing a dry gas.
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the cavity (20) containing the polarizer (23) communicates with

an opening which receives an end-piece (26) containing an optical
fiber (27) terminated by a lens (28).
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that the cavity (21) containing the analyzer (24) communicates with

two openings which receive two end-pieces (32, 33) containing
respective optical fibers, each of which is terminated by a lens (34,

35).
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that the cavity (21) containing the analyzer (24) communicates with 

an opening which receives an end-piece (43) containing two optical
fibers (44, 45) without lenses.
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that one edge (17) of the ring has a zone (17A) that is treated to

make it reflective, enabling the light to make two turns in opposite
directions around the opening, the ring having a single cavity (50)

that houses the polarizer (51) and the analyzer (54), the light being
fed in via at least one optical fiber (27) and leaving the analyzer

via at least two optical fibers (44, 45).
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in
that a plurality of independent light beams are caused to pass

through the same ring, the same polarizer, and the same analyzer so
as to obtain a plurality of simultaneous and independent measurements

with the same device.
