<ABSTRACT>
The pyrolysis of fluoropolymers leads in high yield to pure fluorinated monomers if the finely divided polymers are introduced with water vapour into a fluidised bed reactor which as a fluidised bed contains an inert, granular material, the water vapour functioning as fluidising gas.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of fluorinated monomers 
by pyrolysis of fluorinated polymers in the 

presence of steam, which comprises carrying out the 
reaction in a fluidized bed reacto
r which contains 
inert, granular material as the fluidized material, 

and feeding in steam as the fluidizing gas. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein a polymer 
of tetrafluoroethylene is employed. 
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
pyrolysis is carried out at a temperature of 

500 to 900Â°C.
