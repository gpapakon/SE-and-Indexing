<ABSTRACT>
A multifunction showerhead (20) or hand held showerhead 
assembly, capable of providing a series of water spray effects. 

The primary components of the showerhead assembly are a fluid 
directing valve assembly which includes a pair of generally cup 

shaped members (70,90) co-axially mounted with opposing end faces 
proximate to one another. One (90) of the generally cup shaped 

members has a bottom surface defining a plurality of fluid flow 
passageways. When the second member (90) is rotated in opposing 

relationship to the base of the first member (70), the fluid flow 
passageways direct the fluid flow from an orifice (84) in the first 

member (70) to a pair of outlet passages, or alternatively to a 
sealed chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of showerhead
assemblies and more particularly to a multifunction showerhead
having a hydraulic valve design enhancing the ease of use of the
multiple functions.Multifunction showerheads have gained widespread popularity
by allowing the user to select from a variety of water spray
effects, such as a continuous spray, a pulsating jet or massage
spray, an aerated spray, and the like. However, current designs
for multifunction showerheads are complex in terms of the number
of mechanisms used to select the spray effect. The current
showerhead assemblies require a number of moveable parts and
multiple O-rings assembled in a manner that allows the user to
adjust between the various types of sprays. The multiple
elements in the showerhead assemblies require complex machining
and fabrication techniques and may be difficult to assemble.
Moreover, while current designs may operate satisfactorily while
new, after a period of use they are subject to deposits of
calcium which build up and clog the fluid flow passages as well
as hamper the cooperative engagement of the moveable pieces.
Thus, with increasing use, the mechanism allowing adjustability
between the various spray functions of current multifunction
showerhead assemblies become encumbered and difficult to use.Accordingly, a design for a multifunction showerhead
capable of providing a variety of spray effects, which reduces
the complexity of the assembled components, minimizes the
fabrication and assembly costs, and resists build-up of
deposits, yet maintains or reduces the force required for the
user to adjust between the functions of the showerhead assembly
would be desirable. EP 0 514 753 A
according to the preamble of independent claims 1 and 2,
discloses a shower head providing a plurality of spray effects. This shower head provides
three flow paths by a selector plate in form of a valve element. This valve element provides three fluid
passages via chambers, respectively via passages to nozzles, such that a full flow, a bubble flow or a
pulsating flow, respectively is achieved. However, there is only a discontinuous change from one flow mode
to another.GB 2 068 778 A also refers to a shower head being operable to provide several flow paths which are
selected alternatively, too. In addition, there are disclosed the possible combinations of selected two flow
paths. Further, this spray head discloses a turbine rotor and a pulsator turbine rotor to produce a pulsating
fluid flow.Therefore, object of present
