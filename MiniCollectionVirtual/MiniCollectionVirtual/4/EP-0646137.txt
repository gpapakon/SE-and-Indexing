<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing a supported catalyst for use 
in the gas phase, slurry phase or liquid/solution phase polymerization of olefins. The 
invention particularly relates to the pre-reaction of transition metal metallocene with 
trialkylaluminum followed by the treatment of a catalyst support material. For many olefin polymerization processes, such as gas phase 
polymerizations, it is desirable to have a supported catalyst. Supported metallocene-alumoxane 
catalysts have heretofore been produced by first adding the alumoxane to 
the support and then allowing the support to react with the metallocene. US-A-4,925,821 
and US-A-5,008,228 disclose methods for producing supported 
alumoxane metallocene catalyst. The methods disclosed in these U.S. patents 
provide catalysts which can be economically employed in a polymerization process. 
US-A-4,925,821, US-A-4,808,561, US-A-4,912,073 and US-A-4,935,397 describe 
methods of adding an undehydrated silica or US-A-5,008,228 describes a method of 
adding a wet silica to a trialkylaluminum in a hydrocarbon solution. In each of these 
methods alumoxane is formed directly on the silica support. Thereafter, the catalyst 
is formed by depositing a metallocene on the alumoxane-containing support to yield 
a supported metallocene-alumoxane catalyst. The supported catalysts formed by 
such methods are highly active at conventionally utilized transition metal loading 
levels. It is desirable to devise an economical procedure whereby a highly active 
supported metallocene-alumoxane catalyst could be produced for use as a gas phase 
or a slurry phase or a liquid phase polymerization catalyst. To be most economical, 
the procedure should not require the separate production of alumoxane. Not only must the procedure be economical, but it is desirable to reduce the 
transition metal and/or aluminum content of the supported catalyst to as low a level 
as possible consistent with the level of activity needed for commercial viability. 
Reducing the transition metal and/or aluminum requirements decreases the raw 
material costs. In addition, the reduction in the level of the transition metal and/or 
aluminum serves to reduce the level of those catalytic metal constituents remaining  
 
in the polymer product as residue or ash. Where the transition metal and aluminum 
residue in the polymer exceeds 1000 ppm, it is generally necessary to treat the 
polymer in a subsequent and expensive deashing step. In some applications, such as 
certain medical uses and
