<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of toner compositions with controlled particle size 
comprising: 


(i) preparing a pigment dispersion in water, which dispersion comprises a 
pigment, and an ionic surfactant in controlled amounts of from about 0 5 percent to 

about 10 percent based on the amount of water; 
(ii) shearing the pigment dispersion with a latex mixture comprised of a 
counterionic surfactant with a charge polarity of opposite sign to that of said ionic 

surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, and resin, thereby causing a flocculation or 
heterocoagulation of the formed particles of pigment and resin; 
(iii) further stirring of the resulting mixture to form electrostatically bound 
relatively stable toner size aggregates with a narrow particle size distribution; 
(iv) adding further surfactant to minimize further growth, or freeze the 
particle size in the coalescence step; and 
(v) heating above the glass transition temperature of the resin (Tg) to 
coalesce the statically bound aggregated particles to form said toner composition 

comprising resin and pigment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to processes for the preparation of toner
compositions, and more specifically to aggregation and coalescence processes for the
preparation of toner compositions.In reprographic technologies, such as xerographic and ionographic devices, toners
with average volume diameter particle sizes of from about 9 µm (microns) to about 20 µm (microns) are
effectively utilized. Moreover, in some xerographic technologies, such as the high volume
xerox Corporation 5090 copier-duplicator, high resolution characteristics and low image noise
are highly desired, and can be attained utilizing the small sized toners of the present invention
with an average volume particle of less than 11 microns and preferably less than about 7
microns, and with narrow geometric size distribution (GSD) of from about 1.16 to about 1.3.
Additionally, in some xerographic systems wherein process color is utilized, such as pictorial
color, small particle size colored toners of from about 3 to about 9 µm (microns) are highly desired to
avoid paper curling. Paper curling is especially observed in pictorial or process color
applications wherein three to four layers of toners are transferred and fused onto paper.
During the fusing step, moisture is driven off from the paper because of the high fusing
temperatures of from about 130 to 160°C applied to the paper from the fuser. Where only one
layer of toner is present, such as in black or in highlight xerographic applications, the amount
of moisture driven off during fusing is reabsorbed proportionally by paper, and the resulting
print remains relatively flat with minimal curl. In pictorial color process applications wherein
three to four colored toner layers are present, a thicker toner plastic level present after the
fusing step inhibits the paper from sufficiently absorbing the moisture lost during the fusing
step, and image paper curling results. These and other disadvantages and problems are
avoided or minimized with the toners and processes of the present invention. It is preferable to
use small toner particle sizes, such as from about 1 to 7 µm (microns), and with higher pigment
loading, such as from about 5 to about 12 percent by weight of toner, such that the mass of
toner layers deposited onto paper is reduced to obtain the same quality of image, and resulting
in a thinner plastic toner layer onto paper after fusing, thereby minimizing or avoiding paper
curling. Toners prepared in accordance with the present invention enable the use of lower
fusing
