<ABSTRACT>
A method for preparing optical-grade polycarbonate 
compositions comprises the melt-polycondensation of an 

aromatic dihydroxy compound and a diester carbonate in 
the presence of a catalyst, followed by the addition of 

additives [B] while the polycarbonate [A]
 obtained as the 
reaction product is in a molten state, and mixing. 
Preferably following mixing the optical-grade 
polycarbonate composition is subject to filtration with a 

polymer filter. 
The method provides optical-grade polycarbonate 
compositions, that have not only excellent clarity and 

water resistance, but also excellent retention stability 
such as heat stability and hue stability when molten and 

a low content of inclusions and impurities, and that 
undergo little heat deterioration.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for preparing optical-grade polycarbonate 
compositions. More specifically, it relates to a method for preparing 
optical-grade polycarbonate compositions which is able to prepare with good 
productivity optical-grade polycarbonate compositions that not only have 
excellent clarity and water resistance, but also excellent retention stability such 
as heat stability and hue stability when molten and a low content of inclusions 
and impurities, and that undergo little heat deterioration. Polycarbonates have excellent mechanical properties such as impact 
resistance, in addition to which they also have outstanding heat resistance, 
clarity and other properties. As a result, they are widely used in such 
applications as various types of mechanical components, optical disks, and 
automotive parts. They hold an especially large promise in optical applications 
such as optical disks for memory, optical fibers and lenses, and are currently 
under intense research. In such optical memory disk applications, the emergence of polycarbonates 
having low levels of impurities and foreign-matter has been awaited with 
special eagerness. Methods for producing such polycarbonates that may be cited include a 
method whereby a prior-art aromatic dihydroxy compound such as bisphenol A 
is directly reacted with phosgene (interfacial process), and a method whereby an 
aromatic dihydroxy compound and a diester carbonate are transesterified (melt 
process, solid-phase process). Of these, the interfacial process that employs phosgene uses a large 
amount of solvents such as methylene chloride; as a result, chlorine removal is 
extremely difficult and so chlorine tends to be present within the polycarbonate 
obtained, making the product unsuitable as an optical-grade polycarbonate.  In the interfacial process, the polycarbonate is obtained as a powder; but 
when molding stabilizers or the like are added to a polycarbonate powder such 
as this, re-melting and mixing of the polycarbonate powder must be carried out 
with an extruder or the like. At this time, the inclusion of foreign matter from 
the exterior readily occurs; steps taken to prevent this include installation of the 
extruder in a clean room, which requires a great deal of labor and major 
equipment, and invites high costs. Moreover, during this type of re-melting/mixing 
process, shearing heat is generated, sometimes resulting in heat 
deterioration of the polycarbonate. Methods for the production of polycarbonate by means of
