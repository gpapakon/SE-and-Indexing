<ABSTRACT>
The spontaneous formation of liquid crystal microdroplets by regulated phase separation from a solution of their isotropic state in matrix-producing composition, the matrix being solid and light transmissive synthetic resin, during solidification of such matrix yields a light modulating material consisting essentially of microdroplets (11) of liquid crystal dispersed in the matrix (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to liquid crystal light 
control technology and, more specifically, to the manufacture 
of new liquid crystal materials comprising a light modulating 
dispersion of liquid crystal microdroplets spontaneously 
formed and retained in synthetic polymeric matrix, e.g. for 
use in displays. Recent developments in commercial fabrication of liquid 
crystal display devices have been directed toward materials 
which display images by exploiting the light scattering 
properties of liquid crystals that are incorporated variously 
into or onto a plastic sheet or the like, to avoid the sealing 
problems encountered in conventional cell-type displays. The 
display characteristics of these materials depend on the size 
and morphology of the entrapped liquid crystals. 
Characteristics such as scattering efficiency and switching 
time between ON and OFF states are affected by the diameter 
and density of the discrete quantities of liquid crystal. Proposed types of materials include materials containing 
encapsulated liquid crystals, and materials with micropores 
into which liquid crystals are imbibed. One prior proposal for encapsulating liquid crystals is 
disclosed in French Patent No. 2,139,537 and involves forming 
an aqueous emulsion of nematic or cholesteric liquid crystal 
material with an immiscible binder such a polyvinyl alcohol. 
The mixture is emulsified in a high speed blender or the like 
to form droplets of the liquid crystal that are encapsulated 
by the binder. The encapulated droplets are then coated onto 
a clear plastic substrate having the usual conducting 
electrodes. A similar technique is described in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,435,047. Both these disclosures correspond to the 
preamble of claims 1, 2, 14 and 15.  
 Another prior proposal involving filling the open or 
connected micropores of a plastic sheet with a nematic of 
other type of liquid crystal is disclosed in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,048,358. Furthermore, Applied Physics Letters 40(1), 
1982, pages 22 to 24 describes the formation of an light 
modulation device based on controlled refractive 
match/mismatch between a porous matrix and liquid crystal 
material within the pores of the matrix. These prior art techniques involving the mechanical 
entrapment of liquid crystals have some drawbacks. 
Encapsulation by emulsification can yield a relatively broad 
spectrum of capsule diameters which can necessitate size 
classifying. Entrapment by imbibing into microporous plastic 
presents the problem of sealing the
