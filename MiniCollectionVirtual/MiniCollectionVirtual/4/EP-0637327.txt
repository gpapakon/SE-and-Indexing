<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
polyetheramidoamine hydrogels, to processes for the
preparation thereof and to the use thereof as heparin
adsorbing materials.In the biomedical field, the development of
thromboresistant materials is hindered by the
interaction of the blood itself with artificial
surfaces. In normal situations, platelets or blood
components do not adhere to the vasal lumen, whereas
the contact with a synthetic material causes platelet
deposition, often together with thrombotic phenomena.
Accordingly, polymeric surfaces, which show the ability
of inhibiting the formation of thrombus, are of great
interest for the preparation of cardiovascular
protheses and devices to be used in contact with blood.Antithrombogenic surfaces can be divided into
three main classes:
I) Surfaces promoting the formation of neointima,
since they have adhesive properties for
endothelial cells. Antithrombogenicity is due to
the functional capacity of the cells themselves.II) Surfaces capable of blocking the thrombus
formation, therefore inhibiting:
a) platelet aggregation or activation; b) fibrin
network formation.III) Thrombolytic surfaces.Surfaces belonging to the second class are 
particularly important from a technological point of
view, and the present invention refers to this field.Antithrombogenic materials must have one or more
of the following requirements:
1. Low critical surface tension;2. Negative surface charge;3. Hydrated polymeric surface at the interface with
blood;4. Heparin binding capability, either by covalent or
ionic bond, or heparin controiled release
capability.5. Capability of seiectively adsorbing "passivant"
blood proteins, such as albumin, or of interacting
with blood elements (endothelial cells) without
activating coagulation processes.The surfaces capable of blocking thrombogenic
process are mainly represented by the so called
heparinized surfaces, namely those materials which
interact with the heparin molecule such as to ensure
its natural anticlotting activity. The antithrombotic
effect can be cbtained either by binding heparin stably
to the material surface, thus acting mainly in the
circulatory site where said material resides, for
example a heart valve, or by means of a controlled
release of heparin from the material itself, but
without a complete release of heparin from the graft.Hydrogels are three-dimensional lattices made of
hydrophilic polymers or copolymers, which are capable
of swelling in water or biological fluids. In the
biomedical field, hydrogels are grouped into
