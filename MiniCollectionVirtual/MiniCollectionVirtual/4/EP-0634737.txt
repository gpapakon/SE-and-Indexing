<ABSTRACT>
Thin-film circuits comprising e.g. TFTs have inferior 
performance as compared with monolithic integrated circuits, and 

this inferior performance limits their use for e.g. drive circuits 
in large-area electronic devices such as an active matrix 

liquid-crystal display. In accordance with the invention, feedback 
with an external amplifier (150) is used to enhance the performance 

of a thin-film circuit. The feedback is taken from parallel nodes 
(40) of sequential stages (T1) of the circuit so that a common 

feedback line (51) and common external amplifier (150) can be used, 
thus reducing the number of substrate terminals and external 

connections required. Various buffers may be included between the 
feedback line (51) and the feedback terminal (56) to reduce the 

capacitive load on the line (51).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electronic devices, for example an
active-matrix liquid-crystal display or image sensor or a data
store, comprising thin-film circuit elements which are connected
together on a substrate to form a thin-film circuit, for example a
drive circuit for a group of device cells. The present invention
relates to improving the performance of the thin-film circuit.Large-area active matrix devices were manufactured for many
years with the device cells formed as thin-film circuit elements on
an insulating substrate and with drive circuits formed as
monolithic silicon integrated circuits. The monolithic drive
circuits may be mounted on the periphery of the substrate or beside
the substrate and required a large number of electrical connections
to be made to thin-film circuit terminals on the substrate.In more recent years drive circuits have been formed as
thin-film circuit elements integrated on the same insulating
substrate as the thin-film device cells. This thin-film
integration of the drive circuit offers a number of advantages
which include: a more compact device; a reduced complexity of
electrical interconnection; and a possibility of reducing
manufacturing cost. Thus, if the drive circuit is fabricated using
thin-film circuit technology compatible with that used to make the
active devices, then the drive circuit could in principle be
produced on the device substrate at little or no additional cost
(assuming that the integration does not significantly affect the
yield of working devices).Published European patent application EP-A-0 342 925 describes
some examples of the integration of thin-film drive circuits on an
active matrix device substrate, for example for a flat-panel
liquid-crystal display. Thus, EP-A-0 342 925 describes both column
and row drive circuits, each having an input terminal on the 
substrate for supplying an input signal to the drive circuit, and
having a succession of parallel output stages which are coupled to
the device cells and which serve sequentially to supply signals
at respective parallel nodes of the output stages for driving the
device cells. Both the column and row drive circuits of
EP-A-0 342 925 comprise a shift register for sequentially
addressing the output stages. The row drive circuit may include a
buffer circuit at its outputs to the matrix. The column drive
circuit includes sample-and-hold circuits at its outputs to the
matrix.However, thin-film drive circuits have inferior performance as
compared with monolithic integrated circuits, because the
