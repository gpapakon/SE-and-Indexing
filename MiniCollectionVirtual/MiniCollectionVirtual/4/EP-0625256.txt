<ABSTRACT>
A refrigerant tubing (34) is preformed to provide a flat contact surface (42) against the outside surface of a centrifuge chamber (32). The tubing (34) is tightly wound around the centrifuge chamber (32) in a continuous fashion including a flat spiral (46) at the base (33) of the centrifuge chamber. For the section of the tubing in contact with the vertical cylindrical wall (35) of the centrifuge chamber (32), the pressure for maintaining contact pressure between the flat surface (42) of the tubing (34) and the chamber wall (35) is provided by the tension in the wrapping of the tubing (34). For the section of the tubing (34) at the base (33) of the centrifuge chamber (32), contact pressure may be provided by a clamping mechanism (58). To further enhance heat transfer between the refrigerant coils and the centrifuge chamber (32), a high heat conductive epoxy (44) may be applied between the tubing (34) and the centrifuge chamber surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a centrifuge system as
defined in the preamble of claim 1. Such a system is known, for
example, from GB-A-2 150 717.Centrifugation generally involves rotating a
sample solution at high speed about an axis to create a
high centrifugal field to separate the sample into its
components based upon their relative specific gravity.
Referring to Fig. 1, the sample is carried in a rotor 10
which is placed in a centrifuge chamber 12 in a centrifuge
instrument. The rotor 10 is driven to rotate at high speed
by a motor 14 beneath the centrifuge chamber 12. At high
speed operations, e.g. greater than 10,000 rpm, aerodynamic
drag on the rotor becomes significant. Significantly more
power is required to overcome the aerodynamic drag at high
speed. In addition, cooling means should be provided to
offset the heat generated by aerodynamic friction. Some
centrifuges are provided with means for drawing a vacuum or
partial vacuum in the centrifuge chamber in an effort to
reduce the aerodynamic drag; however, cooling is still
essential.In the past, cooling of the centrifuge chamber
has been accomplished by attaching refrigerant coils to the
outside of the centrifuge chamber. Referring to Figs. 1
and 2, two prior art methods of attaching the refrigerant
coils are shown. In Fig. 1, the refrigerant "coils" are in 
the form of passages 16 formed by welding a corrugated sleeve
18 around the centrifuge chamber 12. (The size of the
corrugations are exaggerated in the illustration.) A
refrigeration unit 17 circulates refrigerant through the
passages 16 between the sleeve 18 and the outside wall of the
centrifuge chamber 12. In this prior art configuration, a
space must be provided between adjacent passages to allow for
welding (e.g. at 19 and 20) which reduces available surface
area for efficient heat transferred from the chamber.In Fig. 2, circular refrigerant tubing 22 is soldered to
the outside wall of the centrifuge chamber 12. Adjacent
sections of the tubing 22 are spaced apart to provide
clearance for applying solder 23. (The size and spacing of
the tubing is exaggerated in the illustration.)U.K. Pat. No. 1,182,940 to Harbott discloses a centrifuge
having a casing containing a framework supporting an electric
drive motor and a bowl. A heat-exchange coil surrounds the
bowl and is connected to heating and refrigerating equipment.
In this manner, the bowl temperature may be maintained in the
range of -20°C to 40°C.U.K. Pat. No. 2,150,717 A to Kroiss et al. discloses, in
pertinent part, a
