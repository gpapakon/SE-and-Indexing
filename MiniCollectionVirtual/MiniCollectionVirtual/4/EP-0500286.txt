<ABSTRACT>
An optical waveguide recording medium playing 
apparatus, which has a heterodyne detection optical 

system, uses a waveguide light delaying/reflecting 
device (37) to generate reference light. This 

waveguide light delaying/reflecting device (37) is 
provided with a transducer (101) which generates a 

surface elastic wave, so that the surface elastic wave 
may propagate in the light propagating direction of an 

optical waveguide (100). Reference light from a laser 
beam is guided onto the optical waveguide (100), and a 

high-frequency drive current modulated in burst form is 
applied to an electrode (101) to generate a surface 

elastic wave, thereby accomplishing the shifting and 
phase delay of the light frequency of the reference 

light, which ensures information reproduction, through 
the interaction of the laser beam and the surface 

elastic wave. The frequency-shifting as well as phase 
delay of the reference light due to the Doppler effect 

may also be accomplished by using an acoustooptic 
modulating element (37) and driving it by a burst 

modulation signal. The acoustooptic modulating element 
comprises a bulk crystal block (100) of Te0₂, for 

example, and an ultrasonic wave generating element 
(101) with an opening (101a) formed in one end thereof 

through which a laser beam enters in such a way that 
the beam incident direction becomes
 parallel to the 
ultrasonic propagating direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a playing apparatus 
which uses an optical recording medium, particularly an 
optical waveguide recording medium having an optical 
waveguide provided with refractive index-discontinuous 
portions to guide a laser beam (generally termed, 
including low coherent light beam) thereon to produce 
reflection of the guided beam having a plurality of 
different amplitudes and phase delays to perform optical 
heterodyne detection of the reflected part of the guided 
beam and Doppler-shifted laser beam, in order to 
reproduce recorded information as a time-series signal 
waveform. As a conventional optical recording medium there is 
an optical disk which has a plurality of low-reflectance 
recesses aligned in series as recorded information on a 
high-reflectance flat reflecting film that is formed as a 
recording film on a disk-shaped substrate. With this 
optical recording medium in use, a laser beam is 
irradiated and converged on the row of recesses to detect 
the difference between the amount of reflected light from  
 
the reflecting film and from the recesses as recorded 
information. Another type of optical recording medium is 
a photomagnetic disk which has a plurality of minute 
magnetization-inverted regions aligned on a uniaxial-magnetic 
anisotropic recording film to record 
information. With this optical recording medium in use, 
the difference between the rotational angles of the 
polarizing planes of the reflected light from the 
magnetization-inverted regions is detected as recorded 
information. As information is reproduced from those optical 
recording media by utilizing the reflected light from the 
row of recesses or magnetization-inverted regions serving 
as a recording portion, there is a limit to the surface 
density of the recording portion. At the time of 
information reproduction from those optical recording 
media, the focal point of the laser beam is shifted along 
the optical axis so as to follow up the surface vibration 
of the optical recording media. A focusing is however 
necessary for each spot of the recording portion. 
Further, the reflectance of the reflected light and the 
rotational angle of the polarizing plane are very small, 
the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of an optical signal to 
be detected is low. In addition, as a time-series signal 
is reproduced only by the movement of a row of recording  
 
portions, the access time for information reproduction 
and recording is restricted by the moving speed of the 
optical recording medium.
