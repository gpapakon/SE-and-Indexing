<ABSTRACT>
In a material consisting of aluminium or aluminium alloys with a wear-resistant and load-bearing MMC surface layer, the MMC layer has a layer thickness of between 200  mu m and 3 mm and contains homogeneously distributed SiC particles in an AlSi matrix, which is hypereutectoid with respect to the Si content, with primary Si crystals. The material is particularly suitable for applications, where wear or weight are critical and in which additionally a high strength of the material is demanded. The invention also relates to the process for the laser-induced production of the wear-resistant and load-bearing MMC layers (6) on substrates (3) of aluminium or aluminium alloys.

Material consisting of aluminium or aluminium alloys with a wear-resistant, load-bearing
MMC surface layer containing an AlSi matrix which is hypereutectic with

respect to the Si content and SiC particles, characterised in that the MMC layer
comprises between 1 and 40 % by weight SiC in the form of homogeneously

distributed SiC particles having a particle size of between 5 and 100 µm in an
AlSi matrix which is hypereutectic with respect to the Si content having an Si

content of between 20 and 50 % by weight and homogeneously distributed
primary Si crystals, and the layer thickness of the MMC layer is 200 µm to 3 mm.
Material according to claim 1, characterised in that the Si crystals in the AlSi
matrix have a particle size of 5 µm to 50 µm.
Material according to claim 1, characterised in that the MMC layer contains less
than 1 % by weight Al

.
Use of the material according to claims 1 to 3 for applications in which wear or
weight is critical and in which, in addition, the material must display high

strength.
Process for the laser-induced production of a wear-resistant, load-bearing MMC
layer on substrates consisting of aluminium or aluminium alloys by feeding a

powder mixture containing Si powder, SiC particles and pre-alloyed AlSi powder
or a powder mixture containing Si powder and Al powder and SiC particles by

means of an inert carrier gas flow through a nozzle directed on to the substrate
surface, a flat MMC layer being formed as a result of predetermined relative

movement between the substrate to be coated and the impact face of the powder
mixture or the laser beam, characterised in that the material composition of the

powder mixture corresponds essentially to the composition of the desired MMC
layer and the powder mixture passes through a laser beam on its flight path

between the nozzle opening and the substrate surface for the absorption of heat,
the laser beam being directed on to the impact face of the powder mixture on the

substrate surface and the powder mixture being heated so intensely as it passes 
through the laser beam and as a result of the heat radiated by the melting zone

situated on the substrate surface that a substantial proportion of the quantity of
heat required for the production of a homogeneous alloy from the powder mixture

is produced by the powder mixture striking the substrate surface and a melting
zone delimited essentially by the laser beam and the jet of powder mixture is

formed on the substrate surface, containing the powder mixture and a small
quantity of molten substrate material.
Process according to claim 5, characterised in that the composition of the powder
mixture contains between 28 and 90 % by weight pre-alloyed AlSi12, between 5

and 43 % by weight Si and between 1 and 50 % by weight SiC.
Process according to claim 5, characterised in that the composition of the powder
mixture contains between 25 and 80 % by weight Al, between 10 and 50 % by

weight Si and between 1 and 50 % by weight SiC.
Process according to claim 5, characterised in that the temperature of the melting
zone during the alloying process is between 1300°C and 2100°C.
Process according to claim 5, characterised in that the substrate surface is melted
to a d
epth of between 10 and 150 µm, preferably less than 60 µm, during the
alloying process.
Process according to claim 5, characterised in that the particles of the powder
mixture strike the substrate surface at a velocity of 1 to 4 m/s.
Process according to claim 5, characterised in that the liquid alloying state lasts
locally less than 0.5 s.
Process according to claim 5, characterised in that alloying additives, preferably
Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mg or Zn are added to the powder mixture.
Use of the process according to claim 5 for the production of wear-resistant, load-bearing
MMC layers having a thickness of 200 µm to 3 mm on substrates

consisting of aluminium or aluminium alloys.
