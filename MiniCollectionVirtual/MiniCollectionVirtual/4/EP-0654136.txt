<ABSTRACT>
A device for the free-standing installation of such a radiator as having a channel (16) along one edge, and an edge portion (17) projecting outside this channel, includes a foot (1) secured in a substrate. The foot carries, via a vertically adjustable bar (6), a fixed backing portion (9) and a pivotal clamping portion (10). Both the backing portion (9) and the clamping portion (10), which are approximately mirror images of one another, are provided with fixing devices (18) for abutting against opposing sides of the edge portion (17) and engagement portions (14, 20, respectively) for abutement against opposing sides of the radiator over the channel (16), the fixing devices (18) and the engagement portions (14, 20) on both the backing portion (9) and the clamping portion (10), being located on opposing sides of the radiator. The clamping portion (10) is, by means of a clamping nut (24) on the bar (6), pivotal for abutting against the radiator, the backing portion (9) forming a back-up on such abutment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combination of a radiator 
being composed of at lest two sections and a device for 
installation thereof according to the preamble of claim 1. Anchorages for the free-standing floor installation of radiators are 
previously known in the art, for both single section radiators and double and 
multiple section radiators. As a rule, such anchorages have a footplate for 
securement to the floor. The footplate serves for anchoring a vertical bar or 
rail on which different types of fixing devices are then adjustably mounted 
for cooperation with the radiator proper. Typical and mutually very similar examples of anchoring 
devices of the above type are disclosed in DE 2 801 121 and 
DE 3 245 555. In both documents are described devices having 
a foot plate from which upwardly extends a vertical bar, that 
in the case of double or multi section radiators is located 
between the sections. In both publications there is used a 
lower horizontal support on which the two sections are 
carried. In both cases this support is adjustable both vertically 
and horizontally. In DE 2 801 121 there is an upper 
hold down member for securing the radiator. As a rule, the radiators which are installed in this manner are not 
standardized in respect of dimensions or design and construction. This 
implies that a radiator anchorage which is to be anything like universally 
applicable must be capable of adjustment in innumerable ways in order 
thereby to fit radiators of different heights, different spacing between 
included sections, radiators with and without convector plates, and so on.  
 According to prior art techniques, these problems have been overcome in 
such a manner that the radiator anchorage in question is composed of a 
number of standardized components, while still retaining generous 
adjustment possibilities. This entails that every radiator anchorage must 
include a large number of small parts, which will be expensive in 
manufacture, assembly and use as well. Because of the numerous adjustment possibilities and compositions from a 
plurality of different small components, a radiator anchorage of this type will 
not be sufficiently stable. This lack of stability is extremely serious in modern 
construction engineering, given that the radiators' connection pipes are of 
flimsy dimensions and, for example, may consist of plastics and, as a result, 
by no means can contribute in the fixing and retention of the radiator in 
place. The present invention has for its object to realise a

The combination as claimed in any one of claims 1-4, 

characterized
 in that, the foot arrangement (1) 
is, at its end facing towards the clamping device (10), 

provided with locking means (24) movable into cooperation 
with an actuator portion (23) on the clamping device (10) for  

 
actuation thereof towards its abutment position and for 

locking thereof in said position. 
The combination as claimed in claim 5, 
characterized
 in that, the locking means (24) is provided
