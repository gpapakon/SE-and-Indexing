<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of an amorphous monospheric form of insulin derivatives entails the insulin derivative being dissolved in an n-propanol/buffer mixture at a pH of 4.5 to 6.5, adjusting to an n-propanol content of more than 13% based on water, and subsequently diluting the resulting solution with water.

An amorphous monospheric form of insulin derivatives, obtainable
when


A) the insulin derivative is dissolved in an n-propanol/buffer mixture in
which the n-propanol content relative to water is more than 15% and

the pH is from 4.5 to 6.5,
and
B) the resulting solution is diluted with water so that the n-propanol
content relative to water is less than 15%, whereupon an insulin

derivative which is in an amorphous monospheric form as shown by
Debye-Scherrer X-ray analysis precipitates out of the solution.
An amorphous monospheric form of an insulin derivative as claimed in
claim 1, wherein an insulin derivative of the formula I



in which

X
is a genetically encodable amino acid residue,
n i
is an integer from 1 to 10,
Y
' is a genetically encodable amino acid residue, 
R
1
is a phenylalanine residue or a hydrogen atom,
R
2
is a genetically encodable amino acid residue and

the residues A2 - A20 correspond to the amino acid sequence of the A
chain of human insulin, animal insulin or an insulin derivative, and the

residues B2 - B29 correspond to the amino acid sequence of the B
chain of human insulin, animal insulin or an insulin derivative, is used.
An amorphous monospheric form of an insulin derivative as claimed in
claim 1, wherein an insulin derivative of the formula I, in which


X
is an Arg or Lys amino acid residue,
n
is an integer 1 or 2,
Y
is the Ala, Thr or Ser amino acid residue,
R
1
is the Phe amino acid residue,
R
2
is the Asn, Ser or Gly amino acid residue,

and the residues A2 - A20 and B2 - B29 correspond to the amino acid
sequence of the A and B chains of human insulin, is used.
An amorphous monospheric form of an insulin derivative as claimed in
claim 1, wherein an insulin derivative of the formula I, in which


X
is an Arg or Lys amino acid residue,
n
is an integer 1 or 2,
Y
is the Thr amino acid residue,
R
1
is the Phe amino acid residue,
R
2
is the Asn or Gly amino acid residue,

sequence of the A and B chains of human insulin, is used.
A process for the production of an amorphous, monospheric form of
an insulin derivative as defined in one or more of claims 1 to 4, which

comprises

A) the insulin derivative being dissolved in an n-propanol/buffer
mixture in which the n-propanol content relative to water is more

than 15% and the pH is from 4.5 to 6.5,

and
B) the resulting solution being diluted with water so that the n-propanol
content relative to water is less than 15%, whereupon an

insulin derivative which is in an amorphous monospheric form as
shown by Debye-Scherrer X-ray analysis precipitates out of the

solution.
The process as claimed in claim 5, wherein the propanol concentration
after the dilution is 5 to 12%.
The process as claimed in claim 5, wherein a buffer containing glycine,
ammonium sulfate and acetic acid is used.
A pharmaceutical composition, containing the amorphous
monospheric form of an insulin derivative as claimed in one or more of

claims 1 to 4 or as obtained as claimed in claims 5 to 7 and a physiologically
tolerated vehicle.
A pharmaceutical composition as claimed in claim 8 for the treatment
of diabetes mellitus.
The use of the amorphous monospheric form of an insulin derivative
as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 4 or as obtained as claimed in claims

5 to 7, and of the pharmaceutical compositions as claimed in claim 8 or 9 for
the treatment of diabetes mellitus.
