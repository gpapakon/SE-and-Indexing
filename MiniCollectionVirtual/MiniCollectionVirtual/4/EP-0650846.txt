<ABSTRACT>
In order to optimize print quality, it is desirable to 
minimize the distance between a inkjet printhead (26) and the 

medium (90) that is being printed on. On the other hand, 
large dense areas of ink such as typically occurs in high 

quality color graphics will cause buckling of the print 
medium, and will be scraped and smeared by the printhead as 

the ink is applied unless a greater distance is maintained 
between the printhead and the nominal location of the print 

medium than is desirable for optimal quality of black on white 
text. Color inkjet printers (10) commonly employ a plurality 

of print cartridges (22), usually either two or four, mounted 
in the printer carriage (20) to produce a full spectrum of 

colors. It is therefore advantageous if at least the black 
print cartridge is closer to the print medium when printing 

text than is at least the color cartridge when printing color 
graphics. Accordingly, a pen carriage with adjustable 

printhead-to-medium spacing (44, 115, Fig 8) is disclosed. A 
controller (120) tells the printer to decrease the 

printhead-to-medium spacing when text printing is being 
performed and to increase the printhead-to-medium spacing when 

printing color graphics and/or large dense area, based on the 
current print mode, the type of ink being used and/or the 

density of the ink being deposited, to thereby enable at least 
the black printhead to be as close to the medium as possible 

during the printing of black on white text, so that the print 
quality of conventional text will be optimized.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of thermal
inkjet printers and more particularly to providing a
relatively close printhead-to-medium spacing when printing
high quality black on white text and a relatively distant
printhead-to-medium spacing when printing a dense full color
graphics image.Inkjet printers have gained wide acceptance. These
printers are described by W.J. Lloyd and H.T. Taub in "Ink Jet
Devices," Chapter 13 of Output Hardcopy Devices (ed. R.C.
Durbeck and S. Sherr, San Diego: Academic Press, 1988) and
U.S. Patents 4,490,728 and 4,313,684. Inkjet printers produce
high quality print, are compact and portable, and print
quickly and quietly because only ink strikes the paper.An inkjet printer forms a printed image by printing a
pattern of individual dots of ink at particular locations of
an array defined for the print medium onto which the ink is
being applied. The locations are conveniently visualized as
being small dots in a rectilinear array. The locations are 
sometimes "dot locations", "dot positions", or "pixels".
Thus, the printing operation can be viewed as the filling of
a pattern of dot locations with dots of ink.Inkjet printers print dots by ejecting very small drops
of ink onto the print medium and typically include a movable
carriage that supports one or more printheads each having ink
ejecting nozzles. The carriage traverses over the surface of
the print medium, and the nozzles are controlled to eject
drops of ink at appropriate times pursuant to command of a
microcomputer or other controller, wherein the timing of the
application of the ink drops is intended to correspond to the
pattern of pixels of the image being printed.The typical inkjet printhead (i.e., the silicon
substrate, structures built on the substrate, and connections
to the substrate) uses liquid ink (i.e., dissolved colorants
or pigments dispersed in a solvent). It has an array of
precisely formed nozzles attached to a printhead substrate
that incorporates an array of firing chambers which receive
liquid ink from the ink reservoir. Each chamber has a
thin-film resistor, known as a inkjet firing chamber resistor,
located opposite the nozzle so ink can collect between it and
the nozzle. The firing of ink droplets is typically under the
control of a microprocessor, the signals of which are conveyed
by electrical traces to the resistor elements. when electric
printing pulses heat the inkjet firing chamber resistor, a
small portion of the ink next to it vaporizes and ejects a
drop of ink from the

An inkjet printer (10) for printing an image on a print
medium (90), comprising:


a chassis (117) for supporting a carriage (20) above
said print medium;
an inkjet mechanism (123) including at least one ink
cartridge (22) supported on said carriage, for applying

liquid ink from a printhead (26) on said cartridge to said
print medium as successive columns of dots contained within

a horizontal swath of said print medium to thereby form a
portion of said image;
a carriage drive mechanism (122) to move said carriage
across said horizontal swath;
a controller (120) which determines an optimized value
for a printhead-to-medium distance between said medium and

said at least one ink cartridge carried by said carriage,
based on the nature of the ink in said cartridge or the

density of the ink about to be deposited on said medium; and
a cartridge drive mechanism (44, 115, Fig. 8) to adjust
said printhead-to-medium distance to said optimized value.
