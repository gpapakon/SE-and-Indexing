<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor wafer processing system for 
processing wafers (22) from a wafer storage cassette (24) 

includes a wafer transfer chamber (14); a wafer storage 
elevator (20) within the transfer chamber; one or more 

wafer processing chambers (12); and a wafer transfer 
apparatus for transferring a wafer between a standard 

storage cassette adjacent and outside the transfer 
chamber and the elevator, and between the elevator and 

the processing chamber. The environment of the storage 
chamber varies in pressure between atmospheric when 

accepting wafers from outside, and a subatmospheric 
pressure when transferring wafers to or from a processing 

chamber. The transfer apparatus includes a robot arm 
(16); a thin flat wafer carrying blade (18) at the 

leading end of the robot arm and configured for engaging 
a wafer from the storage cassette or the elevator; and a 

wafer support tray (40) which is configured for removable 

engagement with the blade and for engaging and positively 
positioning a wafer (22) from the elevator, or a support 

pedestal within a processing chamber. When the transfer 
apparatus moves a wafer between the elevator and a 

processing chamber in an evacuated environment, the tray 
is engaged with the blade and helps retain the wafer 

during transit. When wafers are transferred between the 
cassette and the elevator at atmospheric pressure the 

tray is disengaged from the blade and placed in a rest 
position on the elevator, and the wafer transfer is 

performed by means of the blade alone with a vacuum pick 
integral to the blade. The blade includes upper (18') 

and lower (18'') halves together with defining vacuum 
channels and capacitive position sensors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to semiconductor processing 
apparatus and more particularly to improved apparatus capable of 
transferring wafers within an evacuated environment, or 
atmospheric environment, or between both environments. Semiconductor wafers are typically processed in vacuum 
processing systems. These systems include one or more chambers, 
each performing wafer processing operations such as etching, 
chemical vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition, which 
often require heating or cooling of the wafer, and a plasma to 
assist the process. Typically the environment within such 
processing chambers is maintained at a low subatmospheric 
pressure. Each chamber includes inlets and outlets for 
evacuation apparatus and the admission of processing gases, as 
well as an aperture controlled by a slit valve to admit wafers. 
Such processing chambers may in turn communicate with a wafer  
 
transfer chamber, and in turn the transfer chamber will have a 
valve-controlled aperture by which wafers can be admitted from 
outside the system. The transfer of a wafer to and from a chamber and to 
and from the outside of the system is generally done 
mechanically by means of a robot arm at the end of which is a 
wafer retaining means. There are two types of wafer retaining 
means used in the art. The first type is a flat blade through 
which a vacuum channel is formed, terminating in an outlet. 
This is so that the blade can pick up a wafer by touching the 
surface containing the outlet, typically the upper surface of 
the blade, to the bottom surface of the wafer and applying a 
vacuum, so as to cause the wafer to stick to the blade. The 
advantage of the flat vacuum blade pickup is that the blade, 
being flat and thin, can be relatively easily maneuvered between 
the tight spaces of a wafer storage cassette to pick up a wafer. There are two prominent disadvantages to the vacuum 
blade. First, since the blade pickup function relies on vacuum 
suction to hold a wafer in place, the blade pickup is completely 
ineffective for holding a wafer in an evacuated environment. 
Second, the construction of the vacuum blade is expensive, and 
the blade can break down under high temperature or corrosive 
conditions. The construction of the blade is typically an 
expensive multilayer laminate of metal and plastic bonded 
together with silicone rubber. These layers tend to separate or 
warp when contacted with a hot wafer, and the blade can corrode  
 
in the presence of corrosive wafer processing gases. To overcome the

drawn onto the blade. 
An apparats as claimed in any of Claims 55 to 57, 
characterised in that the carrying blade (18) includes at least 

one sensor (66, 76; 68, 78) operable to detect the presence of 
either the substrate or the tray as they are moved relatively 

towards the blade. 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 58, characterised in that 
the sensor formed in the carrying blade is a capacitive sensor 

having upper and lower portions formed respectively on the upper 
and lower layers of the blade.  

 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 59, characterised in that 
one of the upper or lower portions of the capacitive sensor 

defines a generally closed hoop having an internal dimension 
greater than the outer dimension of the other of the upper or 

lower portions of the capacitive sensor whereby, when the upper 
and lower halves of the blade are joined together, an annulus 

is defined between the upper and lower portions of the sensor. 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 60, characterised in that 
the upper and lower halves (18', 18") of the blade are sintered 

together. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 for transferring a 
substrate in a substrate processing apparatus including a 

processing chamber, primary substrate storage and a secondary 
substrate storage, the method comprising the steps of: 


(a) providing a substrate transfer means having a 
mechanical arm, a generally flat substrate carrying blade at the 

leading end of the mechanical arm, and a substrate supporting 
tray; 
(b) engaging a substrate in the primary substrate storage 
with the blade; 
(c) transferring the engaged substrate from the primary 
substrate storage to the secondary substrate storage by means 

of the transfer means; 
(d) mounting the tray onto the carrying blade; 
(e) engaging a substrate located in the secondary storage 
with the tray and blade combination; and 
(f) transferring the substrate, engaged by the tray and 
blade combination, from the secondary storage to the chamber by 

means of the substrate transfer means. 
A method of transferring a substrate as claimed in Claim 

62, further comprising the steps of: 

(a) providing a first sensor associated with the blade; 
and  

 
(b) sensing the proximity of the substrate, with the first 
sensor, as the blade engages the substrate in the primary 

substrate storage. 
A method of transferring a substrate as claimed in Claim 
63, further comprising the steps of: 


(a) providing a second sensor associated with the blade; 
and 
(b) sensing the proximity of the tray, with the second 
sensor, as the blade engages the tray. 
A method of transferring a substrate as claimed in any of 
Claims 62 to 64, further comprising the steps of: 


(a) providing a source of suction associated with the 
blade; and 
(b) applying suction to an interface between the blade and 
the substrate when the substrate is engaged by the blade in the 

primary storage, whereby the substrate is held on the blade by 
means of the suction as the substrate is transferred between the 

primary and secondary storages.
