group; each of X₁ and X₂ is independently an 
oxygen or sulfur atom; each of B₁, B₂ and B₃ 

is independently a hydrogen atom or an alkyl 
group; Y₁ is a hydrogen atom, a nitro group 

or a halogen atom; each of Y₂, Y₃ and Y₄ is 
independently a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom 

or an alkyl group; A₂ is among others, an alkyl group, an 
alkoxy group or a benzoyl group, provided 

that when B₁ is a hydrogen atom and B₂ is 
alkyl, the compound of the formula (1) is 

either of enantiomers with regard to the 
asymmetric carbon to which B₂ is bonded or a 

mixture of these enantiomers in an optional 
proportion.

 
and a herbicide containing said derivative as an 

effective ingredient. The cyanoketone derivative of 
the present invention has a high selective herbicidal 

activity on broad-leaved weeds, but is safe for grasses 
such as wheat, corn and the like even when applied in a 

high dosage. Besides, said cyanoketone derivative is 
effective as a soil treating agent and a foliar 

treating agent when sprayed as a herbicide to the 
broad-leaved weeds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel
cyanoketone derivative and a herbicide containing it as
an active component.A variety of compounds have been tested on
their herbicidal activities, and many herbicidal
compounds are commercially available.For example, Japanese Laid-open Patent Application
(Kokai) No. 14,503/1982 discloses a nitrodiphenyl ether
compound of the following formula (2)
wherein X is halogen, hydrogen, a
trifluoromethyl group, a C1-C4 alkyl group, a
cyano group or a nitro group, Y is halogen,
hydrogen or a trifluoromethyl group, W is
oxygen or S(0)p in which p is 0 to 2, R is a
C1-C4 alkyl group, a phenyl group, a
halogen-substituted phenyl group, a
trifluoromethyl-substituted phenyl group or a
mononuclear aralkyl group having up to 12
carbon atoms, Q is (CH2)n in which n is 0 to
4 or a C2-C6 alkenylene group, and Z is
-CO2R1, -CO2H, -CO2, -CONH2, -CONHR1, -COSR1,
-CON(R1)2, -CN, -CH2OH, -CH2Cl, -COR1,
-OR1CH2OCH3 or -CO(CR2R3)mCO2R1 in which R1
is a C1-C4 alkyl group, a C3-C6 alkenyl
group, a C1-C4 cyanoalkyl group, a C3-C6
alkynyl group, a C2-C4 haloalkyl group, a
C1-C4 alkoxyalkyl group, a trifluoromethyl
group, a C2-C4 nitroalkyl group or a 
mononuclear aralkyl group having up to 12 carbon atoms, each of R2 and R3 is
independently hydrogen or a methyl group, andm is an integer of 1 to 3,
and that said nitrodiphenyl ether compound has a herbicidal activity on weeds such as
barnyardgrass, Bromus pauciflorus, nutgrass, broad cocklebur and African marigold.On the other hand, Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 11452/1985
discloses α-cyanoketones of the following formula (3)

   which are a compound of the above formula (3) in which R1 is an alkyl
group or an aromatic group and R2 is an alkyl group having at
least 3 carbon atoms, an aralkyl group, an aromatic group or a
heterocyclic group and a compound of the formula (6) in which
R1 is a heterocyclic group, a substituted phenoxy or substituted
thiophenoxy group and R2 is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an
aromatic group or a heterocyclic group,
and that such α-cyanoketones has a herbicidal activity on a variety of weeds such as
southern crabgrass, barnyardgrass, tufted knotweek and slender amaranth when these
are applied in a high dosage (foliar application test).According to EP-A-0281103 a phenoxy-carboxylic acid represented by the formula
 
wherein X and Y are identical or different and each represents a hydrogen atom, a
halogen atom, -CF3, or an alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms; R1 and R2 are
identical or different and
