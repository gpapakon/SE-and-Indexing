<ABSTRACT>
Calender for applying a dispersion with solid resins, wax dispersions and surface active agents to webs or, in particular, sheets, having a heatable calender roll (5), a backing roll (2), arranged at the inlet of the web or sheet, and a take-off roll (6), offset with respect to the backing roll in the direction of rotation of the calender roll and preferably designed as a suction roll, and also, if appropriate, an air knife (7), arranged in the outlet nip, one or more backing rolls being provided (2, 2') and the diameters of the calender roll (5) and/or of the backing rolls (2, 2') and also their mutual contact pressure being selected such that the width (b) of the pressure strip where they are in mutual contact is between 20 mm and 45 mm, preferably about 35 mm, if one backing roll (2) is provided.

Calender for applying a dispersion comprising solid resins, wax dispersions and 
surface agents to strips or in particular sheets, having a heatable calendering roller, at 

least one counterpressure roller disposed at the inlet of the strip or sheet, and a 
removal roller offset relative to the counterpressure roller in the rotation direction of the 

calendering roller and formed preferably as a suction roller, as well as optionally an air 
squeegee disposed in the outlet gap, characterised in that one or more 

counterpressure rollers are provided, in that the diameters of the calendering roller (5) 
and/or of the counterpressure rollers (2) and their mutual contact pressure are so 

selected that the pressure strip width (b) of their mutual contact per counterpressure 
roller is between 20 mm and 45 mm, preferably 35 mm, and in that the speed of 

rotation of the calendering roller (5) relative to its diameter and the offset of the 
removing roller (6) relative to the first counterpressure roller (2) are so selected that a 

dwell time of the strip or sheet on the calendering roller (5) or the endless belt (5''') in a 
belt calender between the inlet gap (4) and the outlet gap (10) is from approx. 2 to 12 

sec., preferably 6 to 7 sec.. 
Calender according to claim 1, characterised in that the offset of the removing roller 
(6) from the first counterpressure roller (2) is more than 180Â°. 
Calender according to claim 1, characterised in that it is formed as a strip calender 
with an endless metal strip (5''') revolving around the calendering roller (5') and a 

deflection roller (5''), the counterpressure rollers (2, 2') abutting the calendering roller 
(5), and the removing roller the deflection roller (5''). 
Calender according to claim 3, characterised in that the endless metal strip (5''') is 
heatable between the calendering roller (5') and the deflection roller (5'') from the 

back, preferably by an infrared radiation heater (11). 
Calender according to one of claims 1-4, characterised in that the calendering roller 
(5) has a diameter of approx. 1000 mm and the counterpressure roller (2) has a 

diameter of approx. 400 to 500 mm.  
 
Calender according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the contact 
pressure of the counterpressure rollers (2, 2') on the calendering roller (5) is 10 to 20 t, 

preferably 15 t. 
Calender according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the travel distance 
of the strip or sheet between the first counterpressure roller (2) and the removing roller 

(6) is approx. 2 m. 
Calender according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised by its use for processing 
calendering varnishes with an aqueous styrene/acrylate dispersion as a base.
