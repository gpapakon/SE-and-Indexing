<ABSTRACT>
A slope (18) is provided from a heater area (13) to the side of 
the edge of a substrate (10) near the heater area (13). A resistance 

film layer (12) and a common electrode (15) are provided on the slope (18) 
which is formed as a convexly curved surface. In the slope (18), 

a reinforcement conductor along the common electrode (15) is 
embedded below the resistance film layer (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermal head and more
particularly to a corner head type thermal head improved in
printing efficiency and a manufacturing method therefor.In using a thermal head, it is necessary to concentrate
pressure on a ribbon, print paper, and a platen in a heater
area for supporting print on rough paper and improving
printing efficiency.For this purpose, hitherto, a near edge type thermal
head with a heater area provided near the edge of the thermal
head has been installed so as to be inclined against a platen
for concentrating pressure against a ribbon and print paper
on the heater area and its vicinity. Such a near edge type
thermal head is disclosed, for example, in Japanese Utility
Model Publication No.Hei 4-46929. An example of the head is
shown in Figures 28 and 29.Figure 28 shows a sectional view of the near edge type
thermal head, wherein a glaze layer is formed on a substrate
10 and a resistance film layer 12, electrodes 14 and 15, and
a protective film are provided thereon.To use the thermal head, print paper 30 is placed under
a platen 51 and from under the print paper, a ribbon 31 is
pressed onto the print paper 30 by the thermal head 50, as 
shown in Figure 29. At this time, the thermal head 50 is
supported by a carriage so that it is inclined against the
platen 41. As shown in Figure 28, a slope 18 constituted by
a part of the glaze layer 11 and a part of the substrate 10
is formed on the edge of the thermal head 50 for facilitating
passage of the ribbon 31 when the thermal head 50 is
inclined. However, the intersecting part 55 of the slope 18
and the top surface of the glaze layer 11, namely, the corner
part 55 is not applied on a heater area 13.The near edge type thermal head has a heater part
having a small curvature and the heater area formed so as not
to lie across the corner part 55, thus the inclination angle
of the thermal head against the platen 51 cannot be made
large. The angle is from several degrees to less than 10
degrees at most. Therefore, concentration of pressure on the
ribbon and print paper cannot be made so high with the result
that printing efficiency is insufficient and a good print on
rough paper cannot be provided.To solve the problem, a corner head type thermal head
is used with the above-mentioned corner part formed in a
glaze layer located near the edge of the thermal head and a
heater area formed so as to lie across the corner part.
Examples of such a corner head type thermal head are shown in
Figures 30 and 31(a),(b).Figure 30 shows a
