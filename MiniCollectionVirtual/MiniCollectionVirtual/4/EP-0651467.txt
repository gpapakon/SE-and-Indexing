<ABSTRACT>
Four solder pins, which are arranged in a square pattern, are connected to the outer conductor and have a square cross-section, are designed such that they have play (they are loose) in the solder holes in the printed circuit board. Their separations are selected to produce self-positioning, clamping fit in the solder holes. Sprung latching means are provided on that side of the inner conductor pin which is on the printed circuit board side.

<CLAIMS>
Combination of a coaxial radio-frequency
connector with a printed circuit connection and a

printed circuit board provided with soldering holes,
the connector being provided with an approximately

cylindrical plug and/or socket part and a terminal part
which is electrically and mechanically connected

thereto and has four soldering pins, which are arranged
in a square and connected to the outer conductor, and

an inner conductor pin, characterized in that the
soldering pins have a square cross section and are

dimensioned such that they have play in the soldering
holes of the printed circuit board, and in that the

spacing of the soldering pins is selected such that
there is a self-positioning clamping fit of the

soldering pins inserted into the soldering holes, and
in that resilient latching means are provided on the

tip of the inner conductor pin on the side of the
printed circuit board.
