<ABSTRACT>
To releasably fix the grate bars (4) of a grate for refuse-incinerating plants, the edge bars of the fixed-bar rows (3), which are composed of grate bars arranged side by side and coupled in pairs in each case by a bolt (12) fastened to one grate bar (4) and projecting through a longitudinal slot (14) on the adjacent grade bar, are designed as fixed grate bars (4') and are fixed relative to the side wall by a swivel fixing, which with a bolt (12') corresponds to the coupling between adjacent grate bars and at the same time can be designed as a longitudinal fixing with clamping means which can be released from the area lying outside a side cheek (2) and put the bolt (12') under tension directed against the side wall, or also by a correspondingly releasable swivel and longitudinal fixing. In the case of a pure swivel fixing, an additional longitudinal fixing releasable from the area lying outside the side wall is provided, e.g. in the form of a retractable latch projecting into a bore in the fixed grate bar (4') and anchored to a side cheek (2). After the latch is released, the fixed grate bar (4') can be pushed forward and removed from the swivel fixing.

is provided, which with the aid of holding means acting
under the surface of the fixed bar row (3) is fastened

such that, in relation to the side wall of the grate
track (1), it is neither movable in the longitudinal

direction nor swivellable in the upward direction, as a
result of which the other grate bars (4) of the fixed

of said connection means, and the holding means being

releasable, at least in respect of movability in the

characterized in that

in each case the holding means limit the distance
between the fastened grate bar (4') and the adjoining

side wall.
Grate according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized
in that
 the holding means comprise in each case a
releasable swivelling prevention fastening having at

least one locking means which is aligned approximately
transversely to the longitudinal direction and is

anchored in a side wall, and which projects over an
upward-facing stop surface on the fastened grate bar

(4').
Grate according to Claims 4 and 5, 
characterized in that

the locking means comprises a transverse locking means
which overlaps a surface, facing away from the side

wall, on the fastened grate bar (4').
Grate according to Claim 5 or 6, 
characterized in that

the locking means projects through a longitudinal slot
(14), open at the rear, in the fastened grate bar (4').
Grate according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the
locking means is in the form of a bolt (12') and the

transverse locking means is in the form of a disc. 
Grate according to one of Claims 6 to 8, 
characterized
in that
 the swivelling prevention fastening has clamping
means which can be released from the region situated

outside the side wall and which exert on the transverse
locking means a pull directed towards the side wall.
Grate according to Claim 6 or 9, 
characterized in that

the transverse locking means is mounted on a rotatable
rod (19) anchored rotatably in the side wall, and its

engagement with the fastened edge bar (4') can be
released by the turning of the rotatable rod (19).
Grate according to Claim 10, characterized in that the
rotatable rod (19) projects through a closed slot (23)

in the fastened grate bar (4').
Grate according to Claim 11, 
characterized in that
 the
locking means comprises a cam sleeve (18), which

surrounds the rotatable rod (19) and has two fastening
cams (24) projecting into the slot (23), so that it

fills the latter in the longitudinal direction.
Grate according to one of Claims 5 to 8, 
characterized
in that
 the holding means comprise a longitudinal
fastening which is separate from the swivelling prevention

fastening and is releasable from the region
situated outside a side wall, and which prevents

longitudinal movement of the fastened grate bar (4')
relative to the grate bar carrier (5), while after the

longitudinal fastening has been released said bar can be
pushed forwards in the longitudinal direction and the

swivelling prevention fastening can thereby be released. 
Grate according to Claim 13,
