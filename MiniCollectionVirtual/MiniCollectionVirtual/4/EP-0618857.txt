suction holding mandrel (3) for the insertion of the 

enveloping film (18) for a subsequent injection-moulding 
operation into a cavity plate (2); 
opening of an injection mould by moving apart the 
cavity plate (2) and a core plate (1) into an open 

position, a controlled positioning arm (30) moving the 
suction holding mandrel (3) during the opening movement 

into a position coaxial with respect to the core plate
