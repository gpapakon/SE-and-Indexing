<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides treatment means for 
reducing microwave-induced toughness and/or firmness in 

microwave cooked or heated bread-like products. The 
invention permits the maintenance of product identity and 

the reduction of toughness and/or firmness regardless of 
the toughness or firmness that the product would exhibit 

without the treatment means. The treatment means includes 
added agents as well as processing steps for the reduction 

of toughness and/or firmness.

<DESCRIPTION>
Microwaves are at the lower energy end of the
electromagnetic radiation spectrum which includes gamma
rays, X-rays, ultraviolet, visible light, near infrared,
infrared radiation, microwaves and radio waves. Microwave
processing offers advantages over conventional oven
heating for some food products because it produces rapid
product heating without excessively high surface
temperatures. However, this type of heating is "opposite
to" conventional cooking of foods with respect to moisture
and heat transfer.Convenience is a major factor in the popularity of
microwave ovens. Consumer surveys have shown that
microwave market penetration has reached 70% of the
households with projections for growth extending through
the 1990's. Along with the increase in penetration of the
microwave oven into the home has come a demand for
microwaveable food products.There has been a large expansion in the number of
microwave foods available on the market. However,
typically this has amounted to the inclusion of microwave 
directions and not food reformulations for textural
attributes. Particularly in the area of bread-like foods,
little, if any, improvement in textural attributes has
been made in commercially available products. It has thus
not been desirable to reheat or cook such products in a
microwave oven. Both precooked and uncooked products may
exhibit excessive toughening and firming when exposed to
microwave radiation.The present invention relates to solutions for
overcoming or reducing at least two problems relating to
crumb texture attendant with heating precooked or uncooked
bread-like products in a microwave oven. Precooked and
uncooked bread-like products may exhibit both toughness
and firmness as a result of microwave heating.A major technical difficulty for microwaving bread-like
products is the development of the aforediscussed
unacceptable texture. The outer crust layer may become so
tough that it is difficult to tear such a product. The
inner crumb may become very difficult to chew. Also, the
textural quality can deteriorate much faster than that of
a conventional oven baked product during the course of
cooling. Overcooking in a microwave oven may exacerbate
the problem while a reduction in overall cooking or
reheating may reduce toughness and firmness.It has been reported that Oscar Mayer & Co. developed
a microwaveable sandwich by using a specific type of
starch, and a precise ratio of starch to fat to flour in
the dough (Anonymous, 1987). One method of dealing with
texture problems is to use a specially

A method for producing an edible starch based bread like product
having a desired degree of toughness, the method comprising the steps

of:

forming a dough comprising water, flour and a texturizing agent selected
from,

hydrogen bond-breakers, selected from the group
consisting of urea, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide and guanidine

hydrochloride,
the texturizing agent being included

in an amount sufficient to provide a degree of toughening of the edible
product when subjected to microwave irradiation which is distinguishably

less than the degree of toughening generated from a dough which
is formed without the texturizing agent;


preparing a product intermediate from said dough; and 
exposing said product intermediate to microwave irradiation for a time
sufficient to produce a desired edible product, said edible product

having at least about 15 weight percent total water.
The method of claim 1, wherein hydrogen bond breaker is 1 to 5
weight percent of dough.
The method of claim 1, wherein the step of preparing the product
intermediate includes precooking the dough; in particular wherein the

precooking is effected by conventional cooking or wherein the precooking
is effected by exposure to microwave irradiation.
The method according to claim 1, wherein the product intermediate is
exposed to microwave irradiation to cook the product intermediate.
The method according to claim 1, wherein the product intermediate is a
cooked product and is exposed to microwave irradiation to reheat the

product. 
A method for producing a dough-based product having a desired degree
of toughness, the method comprising the steps of:


forming a dough comprising water, flour and a texturizing agent as
defined in any of claims 1 and 2, the texturizing agent being included

in an amount sufficient to provide a degree of toughening of the edible
product when subjected to microwave irradiation which is distinguishably

less than the degree of toughening generated from a dough which
is formed without the texturizing agent;
preparing an uncooked product intermediate from said dough;
storing said product intermediate in a sealed container at a temperature
of less than about 5 °C;
removing said product intermediate from said container and exposing
said product intermediate to microwave irradiation for a time sufficient

to cook said product intermediate to form a desired cooked edible
product, said cooked edible product having at least about 15 weight

percent total water.
The method as set forth in claim 6, wherein said product intermediate is
stored in said container and is under a gauge pressure of at least about

one-half atmosphere; in particular wherein said product intermediate is
stored at a temperature in the range of between about 0 °C and about

5°C or wherein said product intermediate is stored at a temperature of
less than about 0°C.
A method for producing a dough-based product having a desired degree
of firmness, the method comprising the steps of: 


forming a dough comprising water, flour and a texturizing agent as
defined in any of claims 1 and 2, the texturizing agent being included

in an amount sufficient to provide a degree of firmness of the edible
product when subjected to microwave irradiation which is distinguishably

less than the degree of firmness generated in an equivalent product
which is formed from a dough without the texturizing agent;
preparing an uncooked product intermediate from said dough;
storing said product intermediate in a sealed container at a temperature
of less than about 5°C;
removing said product intermediate from said container; and
exposing said product intermediate to microwave irradiation for a time
sufficient to cook said product intermediate to form a desired cooked

edible product, said cooked edible product having at least about 15
weight percent total water.
