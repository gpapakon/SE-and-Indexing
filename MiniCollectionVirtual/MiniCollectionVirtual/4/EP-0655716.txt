<ABSTRACT>
A prepayment commodity supply system for use in 
the supply of utilities such as electricity, gas and 

water to a customer comprises a prepayment token, 
typically a memory card or a smart card, into which 

credit data representative of an amount of credit or an 
amount of the commodity is entered by a vending machine 

in return for payment by the customer. The token is 
then inserted by the customer into a commodity supply 

control device, typically a meter, to enable the supply 
of an amount of the commodity determined by the credit 

data. The system includes simple (or "dumb") vending 
machines which are cheap enough to be installed in post 

offices, corner shops and the like, and each of which 
communicates by phone with a more sophisticated 

"special action partner". The special action partner 
periodically downloads a "grey list" of 

customers/tokens requiring some kind of special action 
to its dumb terminals, and each of the latter, on 

recognising a customer/token on the grey list, 
automatically contacts the special action partner, 

which then performs the special action via the dumb 
terminal. A particular special action is the creation 

of a duplicate token to replace a lost token, achieved 
by using an authorising code number which is given to 

the customer when he reports the loss and which is then 
entered into the dumb terminal along with a blank token 

to enable the special action partner to create the 
duplicate via the dumb terminal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to prepayment systems
permitting access to a commodity or utility, typically
electricity, gas or water, and is more particularly but
not exclusively concerned with prepayment systems of
the kind disclosed in our United Kingdom Patents Nos.
2 153 573 and 2 191 622.The prepayment systems described in our United
Kingdom Patent Nos 2 153 573 and 2 191 622 comprise a
prepayment token in the form of key having a memory, a
receptacle for the key (the receptacle typically
forming part of a meter arranged to meter the
commodity), and a circuit (also typically forming part
of the meter) for allowing access to the commodity only
when authorised by predetermined data read from the key
memory. The data in the key memory is typically
entered into the memory by inserting the key into a
receptacle in a vending machine, normally located at
the commodity supplier's premises, the machine then
entering the data in return for payment, eg via a coin
or bank note accepting unit forming part of the
machine. The data typically includes credit data
representative of the monetary amount paid, and data
representative of tariff information and one or more
unique identification codes.In use, the circuit in the meter reads the data
in the key memory, and permits supply of the commodity
to continue until the credit represented by the credit
data is exhausted, at which point it discontinues the
supply, eg by means of a contactor in the case of an
electricity supply or by means of a solenoid-operated
valve in the case of a gas or water supply.As already mentioned, the data in the key
memory is typically entered in the memory, in return 
for payment, by a vending machine, which also reads
from the key memory commodity consumption and other
data which has been entered into the key memory by the
meter. In order to render the prepayment system usable
throughout an entire geographical area served by a
given commodity supplier, it is desirable that there
should be a large number of conveniently accessible
vending machines distributed throughout the area. To
this end, it is proposed that extra vending machines,
over and above any located in the commodity supplier's
premises, should be installed in third party premises,
eg post offices, newsagents and the like. However, to
avoid high overall system costs, it is desirable that
the extra vending machines should be relatively simple
and inexpensive, yet at the same time, they must still
be able to provide the sophisticated functions required
of the system. It is therefore an

<CLAIMS>
A prepayment commodity supply system comprising
a plurality of commodity supply control devices (28) for

controlling the supply of the commodity to consumers in
response to insertion of a prepayment token (10) having a

memory containing data which includes data identifying
the token and/or the consumer and credit data, each

unit having a receptacle (14) for receiving the token and a
circuit (16, 18) coupled to the receptacle and responsive to the

credit data read from the token memory to discontinue
supply of the commodity when an amount of the commodity

or a time period determined by said credit data has
been supplied or has elapsed, a central data processor (40)

containing data relating to the tokens of the consumers
in a given geographical area and arranged to supply

data for and to receive data from the tokens, a
plurality of slave data processors (48) each corresponding

to a respective sub-division of said area and arranged
to exchange with the central processor data relating to

the tokens of the consumers associated with said subdivision
of said area, and a plurality of vending

machines (52) for entering data in tokens, said vending
machines being distributed throughout said sub-divisions

of said area and each communicating with the slave
processor for that sub-division, each vending machine

being responsive to its slave processor to receive and
store data identifying selected ones of the tokens

whose data is available to the slave processor, and
which tokens require some kind of special action, and being

responsive to the insertion of one of said selected
ones of the tokens to contact the slave processor to

enable it to execute the special action in relation to
said one token via the vending machine, and responsive

to the insertion of other tokens to enter credit data
into their memories without 

contacting the slave processor.
A prepayment system as claimed in claim 1,
wherein in order to create a replacement token to

replace a token (10) which has been lost or mislaid by a
consumer, a code number authorising the replacement is

communicated to the consumer and also entered into the
central processor (40) for communication to the slave

processor (48) serving at least one vending machine (52)
nominated or normally used by the consumer, and the

code number is subsequently entered into the vending
machine along with a blank token, whereupon the vending

machine contacts the slave processor and the latter
writes the necessary data to the blank token to create

the replacement token.
A prepayment system as claimed in claim 1 or
claim 2, wherein each vending machine communicates with

its slave processor via the telephone system (50).
A prepayment system as claimed in any preceding
claim, wherein each slave processor communicates with

the central processor via the telephone system (46).
A prepayment system as claimed in claim 1 or
claim 2, wherein the slave processors are omitted,

their functions being performed by the central
processor (40), the vending machines (44) being arranged to

communicate directly with the central processor.
A prepayment system as claimed in claim 5,
wherein the vending machines (44) communicate with the

central processor via the telephone system (42).
A prepayment commodity supply system comprising
a plurality of commodity supply control devices (28) for

controlling the supply of the commodity to consumers in
response to insertion of a prepayment token (10) having a

memory containing data which includes data identifying
the token and/or the consumer and credit data, each

unit having a receptacle (14) for receiving the token and a
circuit (16, 18) coupled to the receptacle and responsive to the

credit data read from the token memory to discontinue 
supply of the commodity when an amount of the commodity

or a time period determined by said credit data has
been supplied or has elapsed, a central data processor (40)

containing data relating to the tokens of the consumers
in a given geographical area and arranged to supply

data for and to receive data from the tokens, a
plurality of vending machines (44) located in said area and

arranged to exchange data with the central processor,
said vending machines being further arranged to

periodically receive from the central processor and
store data identifying selected ones of the tokens

which require some kind of special action together with
data defining the special action, and being responsive

to the subsequent insertion of one of said selected
ones of the tokens to execute the special action

relating thereto, and responsive to the insertion of
other tokens to enter credit data into their memories

in accordance with an amount of money paid.
A prepayment system as claimed in claim 7,
wherein the vending machines communicate with the

central processor via the telephone system (42).
