<ABSTRACT>
A portable computer housing for containing a display device 
having a display frame includes a substrate for containing the display 

device and defining a display aperture, wherein a portion of the 
display frame is exposed through the display aperture when the 

display device is contained within the substrate. The portable 
computer housing further includes an elastomeric overmold which 

covers a portion of the substrate which surrounds the display aperture 
and extends over the display aperture so to form an elastomeric 

flange, wherein the elastomeric flange is positioned in contact with 
the portion of the display frame which is exposed through the display 

aperture. Moreover, the elastomeric flange includes a upper lock 
member, and the display frame includes a lower lock member, wherein 

the upper lock member cooperates with the lower lock member so as 
to lock the elastomeric overmold to the display frame and seal the 

computer housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to computers, and more particularly to a seal for
a computer housing.Portable computers are becoming increasingly popular. A portable computer is
typically transported from a storage site to a remote operating site and then back to the storage
site. As a result, the portable computer is exposed to many environmental contaminants such
as water, dust, and dirt. Operation of the portable computer may be negatively affected if
these contaminants enter the interior of the computer housing. One location where these
contaminants may enter the interior of the computer housing is the location where the display
device of the computer contacts the portion of the computer housing which surrounds a
display aperture defined in the computer housing through which the display device may be
viewed by a user.An article entitled "Packaging the computer for rough service", published in Electronic
Packaging and Production, vol. 33, no. 9, September 1993, Massachusetts US, pages 30-32,
XP413176, Hoyle, describes an apparatus for containing and supporting electronic
components including a display which is exposed through a display aperture.WO-A-90 15359 (Poqet Computer Corporation) describes a mounting for liquid crystal
displays, where the mounting consists of resilient shock absorbers mounted at the edges of the
LCD.It is an object of the present invention to provide a portable computer that effectively
locks out environmental contaminants such as water, dust and dirt from the interior of its
housing.According to the present invention there is provided an apparatus for housing an
electronic device having a display, said apparatus incorporating a substrate having a display
aperture therein, wherein the display is exposed through the display aperture when the
electronic device is housed in the apparatus, characterised in that an elastomeric overmold
covers a portion of said substrate, surrounds the display aperture and extends over a portion of
the display aperture so as to form a flange which contacts the display and wherein the flange
includes a first lock member and the display includes a second lock member, so that the first
lock member co-operates with the second lock member so as to create a seal between the
display and the elastomeric overmold. An embodiment of the present invention will now be described
by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in
which:-
FIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view of the portable computer
that incorporates the features of the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (10) for housing an electronic device having a display (20), said apparatus

(10) incorporating a substrate (19) having a display aperture (23) therein, wherein the
display (20) is exposed through the display aperture (23) when the electronic device is

housed in the apparatus (10), characterised in that an elastomeric overmold (21) covers a
portion of said substrate (19), surrounds the display aperture (23) and extends over a

portion of the display aperture (23) so as to form a flange (31) which contacts the display
(20) and wherein the flange (31) includes a first lock member (32) and the display (20)

includes a second lock member (36), so that the first lock member (32) co-operates with
the second lock member (36) so as to create a seal between the display (20) and the

elastomeric overmold (21).
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the first lock member (32)
includes a first set of elongated grooves and tongues; and the second lock member (36)

includes a second set of elongated grooves and tongues which are formed complementary
to the first set of elongated grooves and tongues so as to mesh therewith.
An apparatus according to claim 2, characterised in that the first and second set of
elongated grooves are formed so as to mesh in a friction fit manner.
An apparatus according to any of the preceding claims, characterised in that said substrate
(19) incorporates a first substrate member (19A) which defines the display aperture (23)

therein and has an exterior edge, substantially all of said exterior edge being covered by
said elastomeric overmold (21).
An apparatus according to claim 4, characterised in that the substrate (19) further includes
a second substrate member (19B) which is attachable to the first substrate member (19A),

and further wherein the second substrate member (19B) has an exterior edge, a portion of
which is covered by the elastomeric overmold (21).
