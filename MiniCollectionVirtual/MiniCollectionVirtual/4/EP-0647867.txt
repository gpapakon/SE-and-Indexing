<ABSTRACT>
1.2. In optoelectronic components which have previously been used, optimum matching of the coupling coefficient to the actual individual case cannot be achieved. The optoelectronic component is to be altered in terms of its structure in such a way that matching of the coupling coefficient to the actual individual case is made possible. 2.2. According to the invention, the entire axial grating (G) of the optoelectronic component is constructed from a multiplicity of individual sections (P), each section (P) consisting in turn of at least one sub-grating field (UG) and at least one grating-free intermediate region (GZ). The sub-grating fields (UG) in this arrangement have different individual lengths (Lug,i) and the grating-free intermediate regions (GZ) have different individual lengths (Lp,i-Lug,i). 2.3. As a result of the grating construction, according to the invention, of the optoelectronic component, the grating coupling coefficient ( LAMBDA ) can be varied virtually arbitrarily in small steps over part of the axial component length (L).
