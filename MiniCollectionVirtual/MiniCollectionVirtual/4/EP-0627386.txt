<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for producing
electrolyzed water for separating liquid such as water (which
will be referred to as subject water to be electrolyzed, or
simply subject water hereinafter) by electrolysis into
electrolyzed acidic water and electrolyzed alkaline water, or for
merely electrolyzing liquid such as water to produce electrolyzed
water.The apparatus for producing electrolyzed acidic water and
electrolyzed alkaline water are shown, for example, in U.S.
Patent Nos.5,055,170 and 5,234,563.In the apparatus for producing electrolyzed water of this
type, the subject water to be electrolyzed such as city water is
supplied into the electrolytic cell, and DC current is supplied
to between anode and cathode plates. Then, an electrolysis of
the water is carried out in the electrolytic cell and as a
result, the concentration of hydrogen ion is increased in an area
adjacent the anode plate to provide electrolyzed acidic water,
while the concentration of hydroxide ion is increased in an area
adjacent the cathode plate to provide alkaline water.In this case, factors governing the pH (potential of 
Hydrogen) value of the electrolyzed water produced by
electrolysis are the flow rate (by volume) of subject water which
flows through the electrolytic cell, the current density across
the electrode plates and the time of contact of the subject water
with the electrode plates. In other words, the pH value of the
electrolyzed water, the flow rate and the sizes of components of
the electrolyzed water producer(such as the electrolytic cell,
the electrode plates and a power source) are influenced by one
another.For this reason, when the amount of electrolyzed water
discharged per unit time is intended to be increased while
maintaining a desired pH value, it is necessary to supply a large
amount of electric power to the subject water, and it is a
conventional practice to increase the size of the power source,
or to increase the area of the electrode plate, or to provide a
large number of electrode plates.However, for example, when the electrolyzed water is put
into use as drinking water or for disinfection or sterilization,
or into a domestic use, a business use or an industrial use, the
conditions demanded such as the pH value, the discharge amount
per unit time and the like are diverse dependent upon the
application of the electrolyzed water producer and hence, in the
prior art electrolyzed water producer, components such as the
electrolytic cell, the electrode plates, the power source and
