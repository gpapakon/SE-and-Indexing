<ABSTRACT>
Control of a fuel rate and an air rate 
delivered to an exhaust gas heater (16) over 

successive control periods by determining and 
periodically updating a desired heater air quantity 

and a desired heater air/fuel ratio, by commanding an 
air rate in accordance with the desired heater air 

quantity, by adjusting the commanded air rate in 
accord with a sensed actual air rate, and by 

commanding a fuel quantity in accordance with the 
desired heater air/fuel ratio and the sensed actual 

air rate or the desired heater air quantity. A 
quantity of excess fuel is purged from the system at 

the end of a control period and provided in usable 
form to the engine (10). Compensation for fuel 

residue in the system is made at the start of 
subsequent control periods.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to internal 
combustion engine emission control and, more 
particularly, to a method of controlling of an exhaust 
gas heater. A method in accordance with the preamble of Claim 1 is disclosed in DE-A-4 132 814. Engine exhaust gas may be passed through a 
catalyst treatment device called a catalytic 
converter, to reduce emission of undesirable exhaust 
gas constituents, such as hydrocarbons, carbon 
monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen. To become 
catalytically active following a cold start of the 
engine, catalytic converters rely on heat energy in 
the exhaust gas passing therethrough. Initiation of 
catalyst activity occurs at converter light-off 
temperature, which is typically around 400 degrees 
Celsius. Following a cold start, the engine may have 
to operate for over 100 seconds before heat energy 
transferred from the engine exhaust to the converter 
elevates the converter temperature to light-off, such 
that efficient conversion may occur. To reduce the time to catalyst light-off, 
exhaust gas heating devices may be provided to 
introduce additional heat energy in the engine exhaust 
gas path after a cold start. Heaters have been 
considered for exhaust gas heating in which an 
air/fuel mixture is combusted and the combustion heat 
energy therefrom drawn into the engine exhaust gas 
path. To minimise the time to catalyst light-off, 
such heaters must be ignited as soon as possible after 
a start time, and once ignited, must be operated in a 
manner wherein maximum heat energy is transferred to 
the engine exhaust path and ultimately to the 
catalytic converter. To provide for rapid heater ignition, it has 
been proposed to apply open loop control to a rate at  
 
which air and fuel are admitted to the heater until 
such time as ignition is detected in the heater. Open 
loop control of fuel and air are continued after 
ignition is detected in such an approach, for a period 
of time until catalytic converter temperature has been 
increased to a desirable temperature, and maintained 
at that temperature for a period of time after which 
it may be assumed that converter temperature may be 
maintained solely through engine exhaust gas heat 
energy transfer. The conditions under which an exhaust gas 
heating system operates may change significantly. For 
example, engine exhaust gas back pressure, system 
temperature and system voltage can change dramatically 
over the course of even a single heater heating cycle. 
Furthermore, as the heating system ages, the 
efficiency of
