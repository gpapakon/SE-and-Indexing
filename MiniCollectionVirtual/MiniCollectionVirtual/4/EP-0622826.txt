<ABSTRACT>
A photomultiplier comprising an electron multiplier 
for minimizing a variation in multiplication factor and 

noise is characterized in that insulating members (80a,b) are 
aligned on the same line (606) to insulate a plurality of dynode 

plates for constituting a dynode unit from each other, 
thereby preventing a damage to each dynode plate. At the 

same time, a through hole (600) is formed to fix the insulating 
member provided to each dynode plate such that a gap is 

provided between the major surface of the dynode plate 
and the surface of the insulating member, thereby 

preventing discharge between dynode plates, which is 
caused due to dust or the like deposited on the surface of 

the insulating member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electron multiplier 
and a photomultiplier. In a conventional electron multiplier, a 
plurality of dynodes are multilayered at predetermined 
intervals to constitute a dynode unit for 
cascade-multiplying an incident electron flow. In 
U.S. Patent No. US-A-3,229,143, insulating balls are 
inserted between dynodes to constitute a dynode unit. 
Fig. 1 shows the main part of this structure. A 
through hole 103 is formed in each support plate 101 
for supporting the corresponding stage of dynodes. An 
insulating ball 102 having part thereof fit in the 
opening ends of the through holes 103 is inserted 
between the support plates 101. The insulating ball 
102 is formed of pyrex and has a diameter larger than 
the inner diameter of the through hole 103. On the 
other hand, the through hole 103 forms a cylindrical 
hole having a predetermined inner diameter. In the conventional structure, an acute- or 
right-angled edge portion (contact portion to the 
insulating member 102) is formed at the opening end of 
the through hole 103. When this portion is brought 
into contact with the insulating ball 102, pressed in 
a stacking direction, and deformed, burrs can be 
formed at the edge portion. When the edge portion  
 
which is in contact with the insulating ball 102 is 
deformed, the distance between the adjacent support 
plates 101 decreases. Even if this phenomenon 
slightly occurs at the edge portions of all the 
through holes 103, the intervals between the dynodes 
vary to cause a variation in multiplication factor 
(gain). In addition, due to those burrs, a field 
concentration occurs at the edge portions to generate 
noise. When a force is applied to the insulating balls 
102 in the stacking direction, a pressure is applied 
to the support plates 101 through the insulating balls 
102. As a result, the dynodes formed integral with 
the support plates 101 are deflected. This also makes 
the intervals between the dynodes nonuniform. The invention aims to provide an electron 
multiplier and photomultiplier structure capable of 
solving the aforementioned problems. The invention aims to provide a structure in 
which plates for supporting dynodes are held at 
predetermined intervals to minimize a variation in 
multiplication factor and noise and prevent discharge 
between the dynode plates. In one aspect the invention provides an electron 
multiplier comprising: an anode plate; and a dynode 
unit comprising a plurality of dynode plates so 
stacked with said anode plate that the last
