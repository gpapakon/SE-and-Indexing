<ABSTRACT>
A filter element (2) to be installed in a vessel (1) (pressure vessel or - in the case of vacuum systems - open vessel) includes a multiplicity of parallel filtrate channels (5) which are surrounded by filter medium (3). At the lower end, in the installed position, of the filtrate channels (5) is situated a first, transversely running collection channel (6) of smaller cross-section which serves for withdrawing the filtrate in normal filter operation. The upper ends of the filtrate channels (5), in the installed position, are connected together by a second collection channel (9) which has a larger cross-section and can serve for diverse purposes. One of these functions is feeding compressed air to the filtrate channels (5) for backflushing and detaching the filter cake.

Plate-shaped filter element (2) for installation in a 
container (1), which element has a filtrate duct (5) which 

is surrounded by a filter medium (3, 4) and connected at 
its ends, in each case, to an associated collecting duct 

(6) characterized in that the filtrate duct (5) belongs to 
a plurality of parallel filtrate ducts (5; 105) which are 

surrounded by a filter medium (3, 4) and constructed in the 
plate-like filter element (2), and that there are provided, 

in the plate-like filter element (2), a first collecting 
duct (6; 106) which connects the first ends of the filtrate 

ducts (5), and a second collecting duct (9; 109) which 
connects the second ends of the filtrate ducts (5). 
Filter element according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the second collecting duct (9; 109) has a larger 

cross-section than the first collecting duct 6; 106). 
Filter element according to Claim 2, wherein the 
filtrate ducts (5) extend substantially vertically, 

characterized in that the larger, second collecting duct 
(9; 109) is disposed at the top and the first collecting 

duct (6; 106) at the bottom. 
Filter element according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the
 upper collecting duct (9; 109) has a pipe union 
(10; 110) which is radial in relation to the axis of the 

container (1). 
Filter element according to claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that the lower collecting duct (6; 106) 

has a pipe union (7; 107) which is axial in relation to the 
axis of the container (1).  

 
Filter element according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that it is made up of two folded webs (3, 

4) of filter medium which are located opposite each other. 
Filter element according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that it is constructed as a single 

element. 
Filter element according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that it is made up, in a modular manner, 

of one or more identical, centrally located modules (150) 
and two marginally located modules (150a), with one of the 

marginally located modules (150a) having the pipe unions 
(107, 110) for the two collecting ducts (106, 109). 
Filter element according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that each module (150, 150a) comprises one filtrate duct 

(105). 
Filter element according to Claim 8 or 9,
 
characterized in that the modules (150, 150a) are fastened 

to each other in a detachable manner. 
Filter element according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that the modules (150, 150a) are braced against each 

another by bolts (154, 155, 164, 165, 166) in the region of 
the collecting ducts (106, 109). 
Filter element according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterized in that, in each filtrate duct (105) 

there is disposed a supporting body (151) with knobs and/or 
cross-pieces, onto which body the filter medium (103) is 

drawn, in the form of a stocking or tube, in such a way 
that it bears against the supporting body (151) with 

punctiform or linear contact.  
 
Filter element according to one of Claims 8 to 12, 
characterized in that the modules (150, 150a) have, on the 

end faces which are turned towards each other, sealing 
devices (152, 153) which ensure an impermeable transition 

between those sections of the two collecting ducts (106, 
109) which extend within the individual modules (150, 

150a). 
Filter element according to Claim 13, characterized in 
that the sealing devices are formed by a groove (153) and 

tongue (152) arrangement which is moulded onto the modules 
(150, 150a) in one piece. 
Filter element according to Claim 14, characterized in 
that each module (150, 150a) has a lower degree of hardness 

in the region of its tongue (152) than elsewhere.
