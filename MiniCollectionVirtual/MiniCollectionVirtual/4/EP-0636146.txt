<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to compounds having general formula (I) 
 
where: 
X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, and X6, identical or different, are each 
selected out of the group consisting of -NR'-CO-, -CO-NR'-, where R' 
is H or C1-3alkyl Y is selected out of the group consisting of -CONR-, -NRCO-, -OCO-, 
-COO-, -CH2-NR-, -NR-CH2-, -SS-, -CH2-CH2-, cis or trans -CH=CH-, 
where R is H or C1-3alkyl R1, R2, R3, and R4 are a hydrophobic group n and m, identical or different, are each a whole number from 1 to 4 
the preparation of same and pharmaceutical compositions containing 
said compounds. Tachyquinine antagonist compounds are known from literature. Among 
them, particularly interesting are the cyclic compounds [GB-A-2 216 
529; McKnight, British Journal of Pharmacology, 104, 2 (1991); Gilon 
et al., Biopolymers, Vol. 31, 745-750 (1991); Harbeson et al.,  
 
Peptides, Chemistry and Biology Proceedings 12th APS, 124 (1992), 
Ed. Escom]. Although the chemical formula of the compounds considered herein is 
considerably different from that of the compounds already known, the 
pharmacological activity of the former is equal to or even higher 
than that of the latter. Therefore, the claimed compounds may be 
regarded as valid alternatives. The present invention refers to new products of general formula (I) 
 
where: 
X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, and X6, identical or different, are each 
selected out of the group consisting of -NR'-CO-, -CO-NR'-, where R' 
is H or C1-3alkyl Y is selected out of the group consisting of -CONR-, -NRCO-, -OCO-, 
-COO-, -CH2-NR-, -NR-CH2-, -SS-, -CH2-CH2-, cis or trans -CH=CH-, 
where R is H or C1-3alkyl R1, R2, R3, and R4 are each a hydrophobic group n and m, identical or different, are each a whole number from 1 to 4 
the processes for the preparation of same and pharmaceutical  
 
compositions containing such compounds. As may be seen, the compounds as per formula (I) described above 
exhibit several chiral centres: it is understood that also the 
various enantiomers are an object of the present invention. Hydrophobic groups R1, R2, R3, and R4 preferably consist of the side 
chains of hydrophobic amino acids, both natural and synthetic, or of 
the side chains of non-hydrophobic amino acids whose functional 
groups were derivatized in order to render them hydrophobic. In particular, R1, R2, R3, and R4 may be selected out of the 
following groups: 
a) linear or branched alkyl groups of the type CnH2n+1 where n = 0, 
1 to 4 b) linear or branched alkyl groups of the type CnH2n-U-W where n = 1 
to 4;
