Earthquake-proof building composed of a 
circular horizontal base structure (1) obtained by 

means of assembled elements (4
1
) which are 
juxtaposed along radii of this circular base 

structure and which together form a bowl (4) of 
which the centre is arranged on the vertical axis 

(X-X) of the building, a vertical storeyed 
structure (2) comprising pillars (9, 10) which 

rest on the horizontal base structure (1) and 

which support storey panels (11), a circular roof 
structure (3) which rests on the pillars (9, 10) 

of the storeyed structure and which is obtained by 
means of beams (15) and panels (17) juxtaposed 

along radii of the circular roof structure, 
tensioned cables (6, 19) also being arranged, on 

the one hand, in a horizontal plane in order to 
encircle the circular base structure (1) and, on 

the other hand, in vertical planes, oriented 
radially, in order to surround the building from 

the periphery of the base structure, while passing 
via the roof structure. 
Building according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the circular horizontal base 

structure (1) comprises assembled elements (4
1
) 
which are juxtaposed along radii of the circular  

 
base structure and which together form a first 

bowl (4), and assembled elements (5
1
) which are 
juxtaposed along radii of the circular base 

structure to constitute a second bowl (5) which is 
inverted relative to the first and which rests via 

its periphery on the periphery of the first bowl. 
Building according to Claim 2,
 
characterised in that the two bowls (4, 5) of the 

base structure are assembled by means of 
interlocking members (4
2
, 5
2
) on their periphery. 
Building according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the 

elements (4
1
, 5
1
) juxtaposed along radii of the 
circular base structure (1) to constitute at least 

one of the bowls (4, 4) are assembled by their 
central end (4
3
, 5
3
) to form a circular collar (4
4
, 
5
4
) arranged coaxially with the building. 
Building according to Claim 4,
 
characterised in that the circular collar (4
4
, 5
4
) 
assembled with the juxtaposed elements (4
1
, 5
1
) of 
at least one of the bowls of the base structure 

(1) is encircled by a taut cable. 
Building according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the  

 
juxtaposed assembled elements (4
1
, 5
1
) of the two 
bowls (4 and 5) of the base structure (1) are 

offset angularly by an angle equal to half the 
angle at the centre of each element (4
1
, 5
1
). 
Building according to Claim 6,
 
characterised in that the assembled elements 

(4
1
, 5
1
) of the two bowls (4, 5) of the base 
structure (1) are identical and are assembled at 

their periphery by means of interlocking half-members. 
Building according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the 

pillars (9, 10) of the vertical structure (2) are 
arranged radially in accordance with an angle at 

the centre which is double the angle at the centre 
of the juxtaposed elements (4
1
, 5
1
) of the base 
structure (1). 
Building according to Claim 2,
 
characterised in that each pillar (9, 10) of the 

vertical structure (2) rests radially in the 
middle of one of the juxtaposed elements (4
1
) of 
the first bowl (4) of the base structure and 

traverses, while supporting it, the second, 
inverted bowl (5) of the base structure, at the  

 
level of the assemblies of its juxtaposed elements 

(5
1
). 
Building according to any one of Claims 2 
to 9, characterised in that the second, inverted 

bowl (5) of the base structure forms a floor at 
its upper face, the floor extending radially to 

the outside of the bowl via terrace floor elements 
(7) resting via supports (7
1
) on the border of the 
second, inverted bowl (5). 
Building according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the 

circular roof structure (2) comprises beams (15) 
which rest on the pillars (9, 10) and which are 

arranged along radii of the circular roof 
structure. 
Building according to Claim 11, 
characterised in that the beams (15) of the roof 

structure are assembled to form a collar (16) 
coaxial with the building. 
Building according to Claim 12, 
characterised in that the roof collar (16) is 

encircled by a taut cable.  
 
Building according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the taut 

cables (19) arranged radially in vertical planes 
in order to surround the building from the base 

structure, while passing via the roof structure, 
are fastened by one of their ends to the periphery 

of the roof collar (16). 
Building according to Claim 12,
 
characterised in that a circular basin forming a 

swimming pool is fitted into the roof collar (16) 
supported by the beams (15) of the roof structure 

(3). 
Building according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the 

vertical storeyed structure (2) comprises pillars 
(9, 10) which support a storey panel (11) which 

terminates in balustrades inside (13) and outside 
(14) the building. 
Building according to Claim 11,
 
characterised in that the beams (15) of the roof 

structure support assembled dome elements (17) 
which are juxtaposed radially.  

 
Building according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the bowl 

(4) of the base structure (1) has sealed walls. 
Building according to Claim 18,
 
characterised in that the bowl (4) of the base 

structure (1) is produced as a volume, as a 
function of the weight of the building it supports 

in order to form a floating assembly of which the 
line of flotation does not pass beyond the edge of 

the bowl.
