Switching shaft for a residual current device, 
having a rotatably mounted shaft body (10) made of 

insulating material and contact levers (50), mounted 
therein, having movable contact pieces (54) fitted to the 

ends of the said levers, one contact pressure spring (61) 
being provided for each contact lever within the switching 

shaft, characterized in that carrier elements (31) 
made of metal are provided in compartments (11 to 14) 

which are separated from one another in the shaft body 
(10) by means of partitions (15 to 20; 24, 25), the said 

carrier elements being latched into place in the said 
compartments, in which carrier elements the contact 

levers (50) are rotatably mounted, and in that the 
contact pressure spring (61) is arranged between the 

contact lever (50) and the carrier element (31). 
Switching shaft according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the carrier element (31) has a U shape, 

between the limbs (32, 33) of which the contact lever 
(50) is mounted, and in that the contact pressure spring 

(61) is situated between the contact lever (50) and the 
web (34), the movable contact piece (54) being situated 

on the contact lever on the web side of the contact lever 
(50). 
Switching shaft according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the limbs (32, 33) each have a projecting 

extension (36) which runs approximately parallel to the 
web (34) and on which the bearing points of the contact 

lever (50) are situated. 
Switching shaft according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the extensions (36) are semicircular and the 

bearing points lie approximately in the centre point of 
the semicircle, outside the region covered by the web. 
Switching shaft according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that laterally projecting first 

lugs (56, 57) are integrally formed on the contact lever 
(51) and can be latched into place in recesses (58, 59), 

holes or depressions on the extensions (36).  
 
Switching shaft according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the extensions (36) each have a V-shaped 

augmentation (64, 65) on their free ends, thereby facilitating 
the introduction of the contact lever (50) with 

the lugs (56, 57) between the extensions (36). 
Switching shaft according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the bearing points are 

arranged between the contact pressure spring (61) and the 
movable contact piece (54). 
Switching shaft according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that, outside the region situated 

between the contact pressure spring (61) and the 
contact piece (54), the contact lever (50) has laterally 

projecting second lugs (62, 63) on that side of the 
bearing points which is opposite to the contact piece 

(54), which lugs, due to the force of the contact pressure 
spring (61), strike against stop edges (39) arranged 

on the limbs of the U shape. 
Switching shaft according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the limbs (32, 33) each 

have, from their free end edge, a projection (37) which 
runs approximately parallel to the web in the opposite 

direction to the extensions and whose edge (39) which is 
directed towards the web forms the stop edge. 
Switching shaft according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that each compartment (11 to 14) 

is bounded by means of two transverse walls (28, 29) 
which run parallel to one another and at a distance from 

the centre axis, with the result that a space (30) is 
formed by means of the partitions (15 to 20), the end 

walls (24, 25) and the transverse walls (28, 29), into 
which space it is possible to insert the carrier element 

with the movable contact lever (50). 
Switching shaft according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that there is provided on
 the 
outer edge of the projection (3) of each limb (22 [sic]
, 
33) a third lug (40) which projects perpendicularly 

thereto and engages behind an edge of the transverse wall 
(28) in the assembled state, whereas the web (34) of the  

 
carrier element (31) is laid against a set-back portion 

(42) on the transverse wall (29), thereby preventing 
displacement of the carrier element in the space (30). 
Switching shaft according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the contact lever (50) is 

offset in the shape of a Z, as a result of which, referring 
to the movable contact piece (54), a set-back 

portion is formed which serves to gain space for the 
contact pressure spring (61). 
Switching shaft according to one of the preceding 
claims, for use in a residual current device, characterized 

in that one of the projections (37) has integrally 
formed on it a tab web (41) which is directed towards the 

other projection and interacts with a latch.
