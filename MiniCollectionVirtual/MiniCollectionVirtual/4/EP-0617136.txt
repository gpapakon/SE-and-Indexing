<ABSTRACT>
Plant for reducing iron ore, of the type including:   - a first reactor (1) containing a bed of iron ore being reduced, provided with means for fluidising and circulating the said ore, and comprising a device (5) for injecting a reducing gas containing CO and hydrogen at the base of the said first reactor (1), - a cyclone (6) providing the separation between the reducing gases containing CO and hydrogen, originating from the said first reactor (1) and the solid matter which they contain, and the removal of the said reducing gases, - a gasification reactor (11) collecting the said particles, provided with means for producing CO and hydrogen from carbonaceous substances and oxygen, and a conduit (21) for returning the said CO, the said hydrogen and the said solid substances into the said first reactor (1), - means (12, 13) for mixing new ore with the said solid substances between the said cyclone (6) and the said gasification reactor (11), - means (22, 23) for extracting the ore being reduced from the said first reactor (1), - a conduit (10) connecting the said cyclone (6) to the said gasification reactor (11), characterised in that at least one of the said conduits (10, 21) is equipped with means for controlling the flow rate of iron ore and of carbonaceous substances.
