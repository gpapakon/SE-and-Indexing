<ABSTRACT>
A warp knit fabric having loops projecting outwardly 
therefrom on both the face and back of the fabric which can be 

used as a wiping cloth, female connector fabric, etc. The fabric 
is a three-bar fabric having bar movements of (1) 1-0, 0-1, 1-0, 

0-1; (2) 6-6, 0-1, 4-4, 0-1; and (3) 4-4, 3-3, 4-4, 1-1.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a knitted fabric which 
provides loops on both sides of the fabric so that it can be used 
as a wiping cloth or a female connector fabric without discerning 
which side of the fabric is up or down to perform the required 
function. In the past (see FR-A-2 211 948) knit fabrics having loops on one surface thereof 
have been employed as wiping cloths but the user thereof had to 
be alert so that the looped surface of the fabric was placed in 
the area to be cleaned. This required the operator to spend time 
inspecting the particular wiping cloth to be sure that the proper 
surface was being used or otherwise an improper cleaning function 
was performed on the surface of the object being wiped. Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide a 
knitted fabric which has looped surfaces on both sides thereof so 
that when the fabric is made into a wiping cloth an operator is 
able to pick up the fabric and use it without worrying which 
surface is in contact with the surface being cleaned. Another object of the invention is to provide a looped 
fabric which can be employed as the female connection of a hook 
and loop connector.  
 Other objects of the invention will become clearly apparent 
as the specification proceeds to describe the invention with 
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 shows a running length of the new and improved knit 
fabric; Figure 2 is a view of a wiping cloth cut and sealed from the 
fabric of Figure 1; Figures 3 and 5 are enlarged scanning electron microscopic 
top and bottom views, respectively, of a section of the fabric 
shown in Figure 1;Figures 4 and 6, respectively, are tilted enlarged scanning 
electron microscopic view of the sections of the fabric shown in 
Figures 3 and 5 showing the loops projecting from the upper and 
lower surfaces of the knit fabric. Figures 7 - 9 are diagrams of the knitting machine bar 
movements to knit the subject fabric; Figure 10 is a diagram of combined bar movements to knit the 
fabric of Figure 1; and Figure 11 is a schematic cross-section view of the fabric 
being used as a female connector element.  Looking now to the drawings, the reference number 10 
represents the new and novel knit fabric shown in Figure 1 from  
 
which the wiping cloth 12 of Figure 2 and the female connector 14 
of Figure 11 are cut from the fabric 10. When the fabric 10 is 
being used to produce the wiping cloth 12 a selvedge 16 is knit 
during the knitting of the fabric 10 so that when the fabric 10 
is slit

<CLAIMS>
A 
warp knit fabric comprising:
 
a plurality of wales and 

courses, a plurality of chain stitches spaced from 
one another in the wale direction of the fabric, a 

plurality of courses of open stitches, a plurality 
of courses of closed stitches between adjacent 

courses of open stitches, and a plurality of 
lay-in yarns engaging and forcing the open 

stitches outwardly from the back side of said 
wiping cloth. 
A warp knit fabric according to Claim 1 wherein 
said open and closed stitches alternate between 

courses. 
A warp knit fabric according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 
wherein said open and closed stitches are spaced 

two wales from one another. 
A warp knit fabric according to any one of Claims 
1 to 3 wherein the design of the warp knit fabric 

is represented with a chain stitch bar movement of 
1-0, 0-1, 1-0, 0-1, the open and closed stitches 

by a bar movement of 6-6, 0-1, 4-4, 0-1 and the 
lay-in yarn by a bar movement of 4-4, 3-3, 4-4, 

1-1. 
A wiping cloth having loops on both sides thereof 
comprising a warp knit fabric according to Claim 

1.  
 
A wiping cloth according to Claim 5 wherein the 
plurality of courses of closed stitches between 

the adjacent courses of open stitches form loops 
on the face side of the fabric. 
A wiping cloth according to Claim 5 or Claim 6 in 
which the plurality of lay-in yarns are under 

tension to engage and force the open stitches 
outwardly from the back side of said wiping cloth. 
A wiping cloth according to any one of Claims 5 to 
7 wherein said lay-in yarn engages said open 

stitch in every fourth course of said warp knit 
fabric. 
A wiping cloth according to any one of Claims 5 to 8 
wherein the design of the warp knit fabric is 

represented with a chain stitch bar movement of 
1-0, 0-1, 1-0, 0-1, the open and closed stitches 

by a bar movement of 6-6, 0-1, 4-4, 0-1 and the  
 

lay-in yarn by a bar movement of 4-4, 3-3, 4-4, 
1-1. 
A wiping cloth according to any one of Claims 5 to 9 
wherein said warp knit fabric is a three-bar 

fabric. 
A wiping cloth according to any one of Claims 5 to 10 
wherein the warp knit fabric has at least two 

selvedges knit integral therewith. 
A method of warp knitting a fabric with loops in 
the face and back side thereof comprising the 

steps of:
 
forming a plurality of wales of chain stitches on 

one bar, forming a plurality of alternating open 
and closed stitches on a second bar in the same 

wales as said chain stitches, and laying in a 
third yarn by movement of a third bar so as to 

engage the open stitches and force them outwardly 
from the back of the fabric formed. 
The method according to Claim 12 wherein the third 
yarn is laid in under tension so as to engage the 

open stitches and force them outwardly from the 
back of the fabric formed. 
The method according to Claim 12 or Claim 13 wherein the open 
stitches are spaced two wales from the closed 

stitches. 
The method of any one of Claims 12 to 14 wherein 
the lay-in yarn engages every other open stitch in 

each of said wales.
