<ABSTRACT>
A paint dosage device is particularly adapted to be mounted in close proximity to a spray gun (P) in a program controlled spray painting installation for dosed paint supply to the spray gun. The device comprises at least two dosage cylinders (SA, SB), each having a regulating piston (PA, PB) connected to regulation means (RA, MA; RB, MB) for setting the paint filling amount of the associated cylinder by controlled adjustment of the departure position of the regulating piston in the cylinder. The regulation means is also adapted for setting the dosage rate of the cylinder when supplying paint to the spray gun, by program controlling the displacement velocity of the regulating piston in the cylinder. A valve assembly (V1, V2, V3, V4) is arranged for connecting the cylinders (SA, SB) alternately to the spray gun (P) and putting the cylinder disconnected from the gun in connection with means for cleansing and paint filling. This paint dosage device is particularly suitable for application in the case the spray gun is provided with high tension electrode (E) for electrostatically charged atomizing of supplied electrically conductive paint. Each regulating piston (PA, PB) of the cylinders is then connected with the regulation means by means of an electrically insulating motion-transferring connection (IA, IB) and each valve (V1, V2, V3, V4) of the valve assembly is made electrically insulating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a paint dosage device
adapted for mounting in close proximity to a spray gun in a
program controlled spray painting installation, for dosed
paint supply to the spray gun, in particular when the
spray gun is provided with a high tension electrode for
electrical atomizing of the supplied electrically conductive
paint, as e.g. known from US-A-5 094 389.As dosage means for paint supply to spray guns, cogwheel
pumps, dosage by pressurized air or the like are used. Such
means often have a narrow regulation range, are highly
viscosity dependent and cumbersome to clean when shifting
paint colour. Furthermore the mounting of such device in
close proximity to the spray gun has been difficult, and long
connection hoses, possibly subjected to vibration, make
accurate and rapidly adjustable paint dosage, which at all times
is adapted to the program controlled painting process in
operation, difficult to achieve. With use of spray gun with
high tension atomizing, insulation of the paint dosage of the
gun from the remaining part of the painting installation has
been found difficult.It is then an object of the present invention to provide a
paint dosage device of the type indicated above, and by which
the indicated disadvantages of the prior art dosage means are
overcome.The unique inventive feature of this paint dosage device
according to the invention is that it comprises at least two
dosage cylinders, each having a regulating piston connected to
regulation means for setting the paint filling amount of the
associated cylinder by controlled adjustment of the departure
position of the regulating piston in the cylinder, as well as
the dosage rate of the paint supply to the spray gun by
program controlling the displacement velocity of the 
regulating piston in the cylinder, a valve assembly being
arranged for connecting the cylinders alternately to the spray
gun and putting the cylinder disconnected from the gun in
connection with means for cleansing and paint filling.Such a device is particularly suitable to the purpose in the
case when the spray gun is provided with a high tension electrode for
electrostatically charged atomizing of the supplied
electrically conductive paint, and the regulating pistons of
the cylinders are then, according to the invention, connected
with the regulation means by means of an electrically
insulating motion-transferring connection.The valve assembly comprises preferably four valves in bridge
connection, in which the outlet conduits of the two dosage
cylinders
