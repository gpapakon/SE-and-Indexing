Vertical cyclically working flat sack machine (1) for 
packaging flowable or pourable materials or objects in flat 

sacks to be sealed, which are formed from two foils (6, 7) with 
a common vertical foil plane (9), with a machine frame (2), on 

which are provided from top to bottom a measurer (3) with 
filling means (5), a deflector (8) for the two foils (6, 7), a 

sealer (15), a discharge device (29), and a longitudinal and 
transverse cutter (30, 31), in which the sealer (15) has two 

symmetrically fashioned units (16, 17), each comprising a pivot 
spar (18, 18'), a sealer spar support (20, 20'), a sealer spar 

(21, 21') with a sealer drive (34), a heating plate (23, 23'), 
a clamping plate (24, 24') and the sealing tools (25, 25', 26, 

26') mounted thereupon, and in which the units (16, 17) each are 
pivotable from a position running parallel to the foil plane 

(9), especially separated by the length of a sealing lift, about 
a pivot axis (19, 19') by approximately 90Â° into a fitting and 

cleaning position, 
wherein
 the pivot axes (19, 19') for the 
units (16, 17) are arranged horizontally, and wherein essential 

parts of the sealing tools and the clamping plates (24, 24') are 
provided mainly above a horizontal plane connecting the pivot 

axes (19, 19'). 
The flat sack machine of claim 1, 
wherein
 a motor drive (33) 
is provided for pivoting the two units (16, 17) into and out of 

the fitting and cleaning position.  
 
The flat sack machine of claim 2, 
wherein
 the motor drive 
(33) is provided with a control unit (32), which triggers the 

fitting and cleaning position at every interruption of the 
production process. 
The flat sack machine of one of the claims 1 to 3, 
wherein
 
also the transverse sealing tools (26, 26') are arranged on the 

clamping plate (24, 24') above the horizontal plane connecting 
the pivot axes (19, 19'). 
The flat sack machine of one of the claims 1 to 4, 
wherein
 
upon reaching the position separated by the sealing lift, 

feelers (58, 59), especially limit switches, are provided, from 
the signals of which the control unit (32) initiates the 

pivoting into the fitting and cleaning position. 
The flat sack machine of claim 2 or 3, 
wherein
 the motor 
drive (33) for pivoting the units (16, 17) has a gear motor 

(43), two meshing gears (55, 56), and one geared connection to 
the pivot spar (18, 18') of each unit (16, 17). 
The flat sack machine of one of the claims 1 to 6, 
wherein
 
the pivot spar (18, 18') is formed to be hollow and the sealer 

drive (34) for the sealer spar (21, 21') is led through the 
pivot spar (18, 18') of each unit (16, 17). 
The flat sack machine of claim 7, 
wherein
 a thrust rod (60, 
60') is driven moving to and fro inside the pivot spar, to which 

a fork block (64, 64') is connected, and that a knee lever drive 
(66, 66') for the deflection of the sealer drive (34) to the 

sealer spar (21, 21') and consequently to the sealing tools (25, 
26, 25', 26') is provided in the sealer spar support (20, 20'), 

with the fork block (64, 64') acting on the knee lever drive 
(66, 66').  

 
The flat sack machine of one of the claims 1 to 8, 
wherein
 
each unit (16, 17) is provided with a clamping device (41) for 

quickly changing the clamping plate (24, 24') with the sealing 
tools (25, 26, 25', 26') arranged thereupon.
