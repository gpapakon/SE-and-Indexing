<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic 
disk apparatus used as an external storage device, and, 
in particular, to a magnetic disk apparatus having proper 
configuration and arrangement of its internal devices, 
and which is excellent for cooling its devices. 
Description of the Related Art As disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined 
Publication No. 2-098197, in conventional apparatus, 
there are eight HDA units incorporated in one housing. 
Here, the term HDA unit refers to an assembly comprising 
a head disk assembly (hereinafter referred to as HDA) 
including a magnetic disk, a magnetic head, a head arm 
supporting the magnetic head, a magnetic circuit, and 
motor for rotating a spindle; an electronic circuit 
portion which controls the HDA; and a fan which cools the 
HDA and the electronic circuit portion. Each HDA unit comprises one HDA and electronic 
circuit portion, comprising two printed circuit boards 
(PCB), which control the HDA, each of which is 
accommodated in one box (hereinafter referred to as HDU-BOX). 
The HDA unit has a tunnel-like box which 
accommodates the HDA and a chimney-like box which 
accommodates the PCB. Cooling of the HDA is performed by  
 
passing air horizontally in the tunnel which accommodates 
the HDA, while cooling of the PCB is performed by passing 
air vertically. The housing which incorporates these HDU-BOXES 
has a partition which divides it into two sections. 
Fans are facing each of the HDAs and are mounted to the 
partition. Insertion with the HDA unit into the housing 
forms a tunnel which envelopes the HDA and an air flow 
path. The PCB cooling is achieved by mounted two fans 
near the center of the housing such that these fans 
produce vertical air flow. The structure is provided 
such that insertion with the HDA unit in the housing 
results in insertion with the PCB in the HDA unit in the 
vertically flowing air, thereby cooling the PCB. One electric power source which supplies 
electricity to the HDA unit supplies electricity to four 
HDA units. This means that two power sources are 
required for eight HDA units. The two power sources are 
placed on the upper portion of the housing, with cables 
provided to supply power to the four HDA units below from 
each power source. In recent years, there has been a rapid 
reduction in the size of the HDA, which has led to an 
increase in the number of HDAs incorporated per 
apparatus. As described above, with regard to 
conventional apparatuses and internal device 
configuration, there has been a need for
