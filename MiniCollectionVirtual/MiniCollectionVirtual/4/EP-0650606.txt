<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical instruments and in
particular to optical instruments having an exit pupil to
which an image of an object may be viewed by an observer.In conventional optical instruments the exit pupil is of
relatively small dimension. Consequently it is necessary
for an observer to accurately align the entrance pupil of
his eye with the exit pupil of the optical instrument in
order properly to view the image or otherwise receive
light from the instrument.It would be an advantage if the necessity for an observer
to accurately align the entrance pupil of his eye with a
relatively small exit pupil of the instrument were removed
by providing the optical instrument with an enlarged exit
pupil. The observer would then be able to enjoy the
freedom to receive such images or light by placing his eye
pupil anywhere within an enlarged exit pupil. However the
size of the exit pupil of conventional optical instruments
is determined by a function of numerical aperture of the
instrument and the overall magnification of the instrument
and hence the size of the exit pupil is of fixed and
relatively small dimension.EP-0 463 888-A2 discloses an optical display unit for
viewing an indicator. An image of the indicator is formed
on a hologram whereby reflected and diffracted light from
the hologram is emitted toward a viewing position for the
indicator. The hologram forms an image at a plurality of
spots around the eyes of the observer so that the observer
can see the image in the observer's field of view even if
the observer moves his eyes to some extent.GB 1,586,701 discloses an optical system having an element
comprising two flat discs each grooved in one surface.
The grooves form two cylindrical lenses orthogonal to one 
another. The orthogonal lenses enlarge the pupil in two
orthogonal directions but provide only an incomplete
field. The discs are rotated and in a full rotation of
the discs substantially the full field area is visible to
an observer for a part of the rotation. With sufficiently
high speed of rotation of the discs, persistence of vision
results in an effectively full field of view being
received which can be viewed from a range of eye
positions. However at any eye position, only a portion of
light from an object is received at any timeAccording to one aspect of the invention an optical
instrument including means to produce an optical image to
be viewed by an observer at an enlarged exit pupil
