<ABSTRACT>
A device for recording an information signal on a magnetic record carrier 
comprises a recording amplifier (3), a magnetic head (4), and means for controlling the 

write current amplitude in dependence on temperature variations which occur during 
recording. This is effected by means o
f a temperature detector. The magnetic head (4) 
has a write section (5) for recording an information signal on the magnetic record 

carrier in a recording mode of the device, and a read section (6) for reading an 
information signal from the record carrier in a playback mode of the device. The read 

section (6) is of the magneto-resistive type. The temperature detector is formed by the 
read section.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for recording an information signal on a
magnetic record carrier, which device comprises
an input terminal for receiving the information signal,a recording amplifier having an input coupled to the input terminal and having an
output coupled to an input of a magnetic head, which recording amplifier is adapted to
drive a magnetic head with a write current of given amplitude, andcompensation means for controlling the amplitude of the write current in dependence
upon temperature variations which occur during recording, which compensation means
include temperature detection means.
Such a device is known from Japanese Kokai 60-143.404.The compensation means in the known device comprise a temperature
detector arranged close to the magnetic head. The temperature detector detects the
temperature in the vicinity of the magnetic head and generates a control signal whose
magnitude is a measure of this temperature. The compensation means subsequently
control the write current amplitude in dependence upon the control signal so as to obtain
a constant magnetisation level in the record carrier at varying temperature.For a given write current amplitude the recording depth of the information
signal in the record carrier during recording appears to be dependent on the temperature
of the record carrier. A varying temperature consequently results in varying recording
depths. A higher temperature generally leads to a larger recording depth, cf. Finn
Jorgensen: "The complete handbook of magnetic recording", 3rd. edition, pp. 296/6.Preferably, the recording level of a recording should be as constant as
possible and have a given value. This is of particular importance for apparatuses which
do not have an erase head and which make a new recording by overwriting the old
recording. If the recording level of the old recording in the record carrier is not
constant problems may arise in the sense that sometimes the old recording cannot be
overwritten satisfactorily. This problem is of particular importance for the compatibility 
of record carriers if a record carrier on which an old recording has been made is to be
overwritten by means of another recording device not having an erase head. This means
that the afore-mentioned requirement of a recording depth which is as constant as
possible applies both to devices with an erase head and devices without an erase head.If this requirement is not met and a new recording is made over an old
recording in devices without an erase head this new recording
