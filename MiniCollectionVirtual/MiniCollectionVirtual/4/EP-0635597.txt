<ABSTRACT>
A steel cord (10) adapted for the reinforcement of elastomers, 
comprises individual steel filaments (12, 14). Some of these 

steel filaments (12) have a difference in torsion saturation 
level in comparison with other steel filaments (14). All of the 

individual steel filaments have a predetermined number of residual 
torsions and are preferably free of residual torsions. 

Such a steel cord is manufactured by making use of two false 
twisters.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a steel cord adapted for the 
reinforcement of elastomers such as rubber or plastic products. 
Examples of elastomers reinforced by means of steel cords are 
conveyor belts, timing belts, rubber hoses and radial tyres 
where the carcass plies and/or the breaker plies can comprise 
steel cords. It is well known in the prior art to remove residual torsions 
from steel cords by means of a false twister or to set the 
amount of residual torsions of a steel cord to a predetermined 
value by means of a false twister. This is done to increase the 
processability of the steel cords and to give to elastomeric 
plies reinforced with steel cords a desired flatness.
 
Despite the removal of residual torsions, however, some steel 
cords still remain difficult to be processed and the reinforced 
elastomeric plies do not show the required flatness. This is 
especially the case with compact cords, i.e. steel cords where 
all the filaments have been twisted in the same direction and 
to the same step, and with steel cords without a wrapping 
filament.
 
Supplemental mechanical processing steps of the steel cord, 
such as preforming or straightening, have not proved to be 
always sufficient to solve the above problems. It is an object of the present invention to solve the disadvantages 
of the prior art.
 
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a 
steel cord with enhanced processability properties. According to the present invention, there is provided a steel 
cord adapted for the reinforcement of elastomers.  A steel cord 'adapted for the reinforcement of elastomers' 
means that the steel cord has the proper features to reinforce 
elastomers such as rubber tyres, conveyor belts, hoses and 
timing belts. This means particularly, either alone or in 
combination, that : 
the steel cord comprises steel filaments with a diameter 
ranging from 0.05 mm to 0.80 mm, and preferably from 0.05 mm 
to 0.50 mm ; the steel filaments are coated with a layer that promotes 
the adhesion to the elastomer ; in the case of a rubber 
elastomer, copper alloy coatings such as brass (either low - 
63.5 % Cu - or high copper - 67.5 % Cu) or a complex brass 
coating (Ni + brass, brass + Co ...) are particularly 
suitable ; the steel filaments have a composition which is along the 
following lines : a carbon content ranging from 0.70 to 
0.98 %, a manganese content ranging from .10 to 1.10 %, a 
silicon content ranging from .10 to 0.90 %, sulphur and 
phosphorous contents being limited below
