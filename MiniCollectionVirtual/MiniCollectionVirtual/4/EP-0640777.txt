<ABSTRACT>
The low-backlash travelling nut provided for the threaded spindle (1) of a screw transmission comprises a nut body (2) and an auxiliary nut body (3), which are provided on their mutually facing parts with a plurality of opposing blind holes (4, 5). Inserted into each pair of opposing blind holes (4, 5) is a rigid connecting body (6) which is guided displaceably in at least one of the blind holes (4, 5) and which prevents relative rotation between the nut body (2) and the auxiliary nut body (3) but allows longitudinal displacement relative to one another. At least one of the connecting bodies (6) has assigned to it a spring (7) which presses the nut body (2) and the auxiliary nut body (3) apart. By virtue of this preloading, the travelling nut has little backlash. The preloading of the travelling nut can be changed in a simple manner by selection of the number of springs (7) to be used, it being possible to avoid mechanical overstressing of the connecting bodies (6) by selection of the number of connecting bodies (6) to be used.

Low-backlash travelling nut of a screw gear with a 
threaded spindle (1) and with a nut body (2) provided for the 

gear connection as well as an auxiliary nut body (3) which is 
coupled to the nut body so as to be non-rotatable and is 

longitudinally movable in the longitudinal direction of the 
threaded spindle (1), 


wherein the nut body (2) and the auxiliary nut body (3) 
are pretensioned away from one another in the 

longitudinal direction of the threaded spindle (1) by at 
least one spring (7, 11) and are supported with their 

internal threads on the threaded spindle (1), 
wherein the nut body (2) and the auxiliary nut body (3) 
are provided on their parts which face one another with 

a plurality of opposing blind holes (4, 5). 
wherein at least two opposing blind holes (4, 5) are 
connected to one another by a rigid connecting body (6, 

9) which is movably guided in at least one of the two 
opposing blind holes (4, 5) in the longitudinal 

direction of the threaded spindle (1) and prevents a 
relative reciprocal torsion between the nut body (2) and 

the auxiliary nut body (3), and 
wherein at least one spring (7, 11) is associated with 
at least one connecting body (6, 9), 
 
characterised in that
 
the connecting body (6) is at least partially tubu
lar and the 
one spring (7, 11) lies at least in the tubular part of the 

connecting body.  
 
Low-backlash travelling nut according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the connecting body is constructed as a 

tube in which at least one spring is accommodated, both ends 
of which are supported on the bases of the blind holes (4, 5). 
Low-backlash travelling nut according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the connecting body (9) has a tubular 

part which is open on one side and out of which projects a pin 
(10) which is guided therein, at least one spring (11) being 

disposed between the pin and the base of the tubular part. 
Low-backlash travelling nut according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the pin (10) is secured against falling 

our in the relaxed state of the pin (11) by a stop provided in 
the connecting body (9). 
Low-backlash travelling nut according to one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the connecting body (6, 9) bears 

on its exterior an additional spring which holds the nut body 
(2) and the auxiliary nut body (3) away from each other.
