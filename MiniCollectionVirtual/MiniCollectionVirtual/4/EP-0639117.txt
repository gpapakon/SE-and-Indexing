<ABSTRACT>
A tool head for use in machine-tools has an adjustable slide (18) capable of moving with respect to the base body (10) transversely to its axis of rotation (12) and of being provided with a tool holder, as well as a device (30) for direct measurement of the travel of the slide (18). The measurement device (30) has two substrate plates (32, 34) upon whose facing surfaces are arranged the capacitive measurement structures of a measuring scale and of a sensor. The substrate plates (32, 34) are arranged in eccentric tangential planes parallel to the axis of rotation. The radially inner substrate plate is surface-linked to a bearing surface of the slide (18), whereas the radially outer substrate plate is surface-supported by the bearing surface (62), capable of forming a support after surface material removal, of a bearing strip (56) that can be detachably inserted into a radial window cutout (54) of the base body (10, 36).
