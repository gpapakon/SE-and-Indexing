<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a cylindrical (spur) gear unit, particularly for drives which are used to adjust seats in motor vehicles. The cylindrical gear unit comprises two intermeshing tooth systems (14, 16) of two gear wheels (12, 18) made from a relatively hard material. In order to avoid the clashing noise which usually occurs when switching from one direction of rotation to the other - this being due to the backlash of the interengaging tooth systems which is unavoidable if the outlay is to be reasonable - at least one section (38) of the tooth system of one of the gear wheels is - as seen in the direction of the axes of rotation of the gear wheels - composed of a flexible material, this section having, over at least part of the tooth length, a tooth profile which is larger than the associated profile of the tooth gap of the other gear wheel.

Low-noise cylindrical-gear mechanism, in 
particular for actuating drives of seats in motor 

vehicles, with two intermeshing tooth systems on two 
cylindrical gears (12, 18) composed of a comparatively 

hard material, the tooth system (14) on one gear (12) 
having, as seen in the direction of the axes of rotation 

of the gears, at least one section of toothing (38) which 
is composed of a flexible material and, at least over 

part (44) of the tooth length, has a tooth profile which 
is larger than the profile assigned to it of the tooth 

gap on the other gear (18), the first-mentioned gear (12) 
having on one end face an extension (20) which is concentric 

with its axis of rotation (28), which has a circumferential 
surface (15) and on which is arranged a toothed 

ring (32) which is composed of the flexible material and 
includes the section of toothing (38) on its tooth system 

(34), characterized 

in that the concentric extension (20) has a diameter 
which is greater than the root circle and less than the 

pitch circle of the tooth system (14) of the first-mentioned 
gear (12), and 
in that the toothed ring (32) arranged on the extension 
(20) has inward-projecting strips (36) which engage in 

tooth gaps in the tooth system (14) of the first-mentioned 
gear (12) which are extended beyond the circumferential 

surface (15) of the extension (20). 
Low-noise cylindrical-gear mechanism according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that the profile of the tooth 

system (34) of the toothed ring (32) is smaller on the  
 

side facing the tooth system (14) of of the first mentioned 
gear (12) and larger on the side facing away from 

the tooth system (14) of the first-mentioned gear (12) 
than the profile of the tooth system (14) of the first-mentioned 

gear (12). 
Low-noise cylindrical-gear mechanism according to 
Claim 2, characterized in that the profile of the tooth 

system (34) of the toothed ring (32) is conical. 
Low-noise cylindrical-gear mechanism according to 
Claim 2 or 3, characterized in that the profile of the 

tooth system (34) of the toothed ring (32) corresponds at 
approximately half the length of the teeth, when viewed 

along the length of the teeth, to the profile of the 
tooth system (14) of the first-mentioned gear (12). 
Low-noise cylindrical-gear mechanism according to 
one of Claims 1-4, characterized in that at that end of 

the toothed ring (32) which is remote from the first-mentioned 
gear (12) there is arranged an annular flange 

(30) which is seated in a depression (12), matched to it, 
in a further gear (24) which is arranged on the extension 

(20) of the first-mentioned gear (12).
