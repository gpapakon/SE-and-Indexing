Apparatus for nebulizing a fluid product, including 
a nebulizing device consisting of a diffusing vibrating 

member (102, 202, 302, 502), a high-frequency generator 
(120, 220), an electrical supply (108, 208) intended 

for the electrical supply of the generator (120, 220), a 
reservoir (106, 206, 306) for the fluid product, mounted 

in the apparatus in a removable manner and independently 
of the vibrating member, a means being provided for 

supplying the vibrating member with product, at least 
part of the supply means, such as a pump (107, 207) or a 

simple valve (307), being carried by the reservoir (106, 
206, 306), characterized in that the pump (107, 207) or 

the simple valve (307) having an operating rod (146), a 
transfer piece (106) carries, on the one hand, the 

operating rod (146) and, on the other hand, a flexible 
member (109) capable of conveying the fluid product on to 

the vibrating member (102, 202, 302, 502) and placed 
right opposite the latter, a communication (164) being 

provided between the volumes of the transfer piece which 
are occupied by the operating rod and the flexible 

member. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the vibrating member (102, 202) is a grid. 
Apparatus according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that it includes a casing (103, 203, 303) having a 

housing (104, 204) for mounting the reservoir (106, 206, 
306) and carrying a diffusion mouth (114, 214, 314), and 

the housing (104, 204) is bound by a wall (118, 216) 
having an opening (119, 205) through which passes the 

means for supplying the vibrating member with fluid 
product, an operating member (110, 210) being provided 

for the operation of the supply means. 
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the reservoir (206) is mounted so as to slide in the 

housing (204) of the casing. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the electrical supply (108) is 

integral with the reservoir.  
 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 3 or 4, 
characterized in that the electrical supply (208) is 

associated with an electrical contactor, one of the 
contacts (211) of which is carried by the operating 

member (210). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 3 to 6, 
characterized in that the vibrating member (202, 302) and 

the transfer piece (160) are carried by the casing (203) 
and the transfer piece (160) passes through the opening 

(205) in the wall (216) of the casing, bearing on the 
said wall. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 3 to 6, 
characterized in that the vibrating member (102) and the 

transfer piece (160) are carried by the operating member 
(110) housed in a cavity (105) bordered by the wall (118) 

equipped with the opening (119), the transfer piece (160) 
passing through the said opening, bearing on the said 

wall (118). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the flexible member is a brush 

(209). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the flexible member is a foam or a
