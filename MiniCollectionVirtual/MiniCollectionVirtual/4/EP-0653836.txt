<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the present invention is a final stage of 
audio-frequency amplification operating in class A. Audio-frequency power amplifiers with a final stage 
operating in class A are known being used in the high 
fidelity field. These amplifiers, though having low efficiency, are 
highly appreciated, since they produce a signal 
distortion which is much lower than the signal 
distortion produced by the amplifiers with a final 
stage operating in class B or AB. A circuit solution which is adopted in the final 
amplification stages operating in class A uses, as an 
active device, a thermionic valve, usually in the 
common cathode configuration. Such a solution has drawbacks due to its weight, its 
overall size and the need to dissipate large quantities 
of heat. Another circuit solution uses, as an active device, a 
bipolar junction transistor, usually in the common 
emitter configuration. The main drawback of this solution is less perfect 
sound reproduction, due to the narrower range in which 
the operation of the active device may be considered 
linear. Another circuit solution which, with regard to the 
acoustic result, tries to combine the advantages of the 
thermionic valve and of the bipolar junction 
transistor, as for weight, size and heat dissipation, 
consists in using, as an active device, a MOS Field  
 
Effect Transistor, usually in the common source 
configuration. As known, amplifiers with this kind of circuit 
configuration have high output impedance, whereas 
loudspeakers, as known, have low impedance. Moreover, these amplifiers have low input impedance, 
whereas intermediate amplification stages, usually 
having a common emitter configuration, have high output 
impedance. Therefore, impedance matching between the output of the 
amplifier and the input of the loudspeaker is necessary 
to guarantee the maximum power transfer. Similarly, also impedance matching between the 
intermediate and the final amplification stages is 
often necessary. Suitable low frequency transformers are used for this 
purpose. However, the use of transformers increases, 
besides the weight and the overall size of the 
apparatus, also production costs. Moreover, the use of transformers causes non linear 
distortions due to the saturation of the ferromagnetic 
core of the transformer. These amplifiers, then, have a rather narrow passband 
and, consequently, untrue reproduction of the 
frequencies next to the lower and/or higher limit of 
the audio band. The main object of the present invention is to 
eliminate
