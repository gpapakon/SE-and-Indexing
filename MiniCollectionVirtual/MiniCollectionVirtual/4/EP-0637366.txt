<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for laying and/or retrieving elongate flexible elements, such as pipes and cables having accessories at spaced intervals, is mounted on a floating vessel such as a barge (12) and comprises two self powered conveyors (2, 3) pivotally connected together through a hinge (19) but which may be locked relative to one another for use. A trolley (4) runs on wheels (8) on rails (5) on either side of the conveyor system and has an upper surface consisting of a further powered conveyor (6). The sides of conveyor (3) extend to form a chute (7) at the outboard end. In normal operation the trolley (4) is stored and the pipe or cable is carried by the conveyors (2, 3) to the chute (7) which guides it into the water. The shape of the chute (7) permits the pipe/cable to leave the barge at up to 45 DEG  either side of the fore and aft axis of the conveyor. When an accessory on the pipe/cable approaches the trolley (4) is raised to support the pipe/cable behind the accessory carrying the pipe with the accessory above and out of contact with the conveyors (2, 3) until the accessory has entered the water. The trolley (4) is then retrieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS FOR LAYING AND/ORRETRIEVING ELONGATE FLEXIBLE ELEMENTSThis invention relates to apparatus for laying and/or retrievingelongate flexible elements and particularly, but not exclusively, toapparatus for laying and/or retrieving elongate flexible pipes or cableswhich have an accessory spaced at intervals along their length.One form of apparatus for laying and/or retrieving elongate flexible pipes or cables is an arrangement mounted on and supported by a floating vessel such as a barge. Such an apparatus is adapted for laying pipes orcables in a deep sea environment and in one embodiment has a guidemeans positioned in order to permit a pipe or cable to pass over an edgeof the vessel and means arranged to support the pipe or cable during this operation.A problem encountered with the above mentioned apparatus wasthat the pipe or cable could not be bent into an arc, beyond a particular limiting radius of curvature, without damaging the pipe or cable. Thiswas partly due to the presence of linkages or accessories which connected lengths of pipe' or cable together. It was also partly due to thefact that the pipe or cable when laid or retrieved was placed under 

considerable tensile loads and when subject to bending this gave rise tostress concentrations, particularly at or close to accessory pipe/cablejunctions. The problem of maintaining the cable in a relatively shallow arc with respect to accessories has been made more difficult by the fact that the accessories have a greater diameter than the pipe or cable. Inaddition to the aforementioned accessories which are integral with thepipe, secondary accessories, such as anodes for cathodic protection orbend restrictors are often fitted in the form of strings of "bracelets" around the pipe or cable adjacent to the accessory. An additional problem arises as these secondary accessories cannot be passed over the relatively small radius of the guidance means without serious risk ofdamage to the secondary accessories and/or the pipe/cable.Equipment and techniques were developed to limit the stresses which occurred in an attempt to mitigate this effect of stress concentration occurring at pipe/cable accessory junctions. One such piece of equipment is described in U.K. Patent GB 2,I73,760BGB 2,I73,760B describes and claims a device for laying or naturallyraising a pipe which comprises in one embodiment a grooved wheel of relatively large diameter. The grooved wheel is positioned at the rear of apipe/ cable laying vessel and is able to rotate about a supporting

CLAIMS
1. Apparatus for laying or retrieving an elongate flexible element
comprising at least one conveyor arranged to support the element and a
trolley arranged to support the element ahead or behind an accessory
integral with the element said trolley being adapted to move in such a
manner that at least a portion of a path followed by the trolley is
substantially parallel to a path followed by the element supported by the
conveyor and characterised by a chute disposed adjacent the conveyor to maintain the element in line with the conveyor.
2. Apparatus as claimed in claim I, in which the or each conveyor comprises an endless belt or endless belts.
3. Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, in which the endless belt or belts may be free to move or have propulsion means.
4. Apparatus as claimed in claim 2 or 3, in which the or each endless belt is made of a chain or chains supported on rollers.
5. Apparatus as claimed in claim 4, in which pads are bolted on each chain link which, when in contact, allow the endless belt to be in the 


 shape of an arc of a circle.
6. Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the trolley is in the form of a saddle having a radius of curvature less than the radius of curvature of the conveyor arranged to support the element at a position
behind the accessory so that the element is held in an arc of substantially
constant radius of curvature.
7. Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the trolley comprises a conveyor which is powered.
8. Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the trolley is arranged to run on tracks or rails.
9. Apparatus for laying and/or retrieving a cable or pipe comprising a first moveable cable or pipe support and a second moveable cable or pipe support, the first and second supports being arranged such that a cable or
pipe may pass thereover, the first support being pivotally connected to the second support characterised by a chute disposed adjacent one of the supports to maintain the cable or pipe in line with the support.
10. Apparatus as claimed in claim 9, in which the supports comprise 


endless belts.
11. Apparatus as claimed in claim 10, in which further belts are placed
substantially parallel to enable independent laying of a plurality of pipes or
cables.
12. Apparatus as claimed in claim 9,10 or II, in which means are disposed
between the first and second supports operative to maintain tension in the pipe or cable.
13. Apparatus as claimed in claim 9, 10, II or 12, in which the supports are
disposed on a series of rollers.
14. Apparatus as claimed in claim 9, 10, II or 12, in which the surfaces of the supports are coated with elastomeric material or made wholly of
elastomer or synthetic rubber.
15. Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 9 to 14, in which the first and second supports have an arcuate profile and are positioned in operation
so that they form part of the perimeter of a circle.
16. Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 9 to 15, in which means are 


provided for pivoting the lower of the two supports to a point where, in
operation, it may be lifted out of the water.
17. Apparatus as claimed in claim 16, in which the means comprise a hydraulic ram.
18. Apparatus as claimed in claim 16, in which the means comprises
winch or crane operable wires.
