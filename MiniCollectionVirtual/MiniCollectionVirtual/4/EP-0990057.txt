<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a process for producing low oxygen, essentially carbon free stainless steel powder, which comprises the steps of preparing molten steel which in addition to iron contains carbon and at least 10 % of chromium, adjusting the carbon content of the melt to a value which is decided by the expected oxygen content after water atomising; water-atomising the melt and annealing the as-atomised powder at a temperature of at least 1120  DEG C in a reducing atmosphere containing controlled amounts of water. The invention also concerns a water-atomised powder including 10 % by weight of chromium and having a carbon content between 0.2 and 0.7, preferably between 0.4 and 0.6 % by weight and an oxygen/carbon ratio of about 1 to 3 and at most 0.5 % of impurities, as well as the annealed powder obtained according to the process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a stainless steel
powder and a method of producing this powder. The powder
according to the invention is based on a water-atomised
stainless steel powder and has improved compressibility.
Components prepared from this powder have improved
mechanical properties.The atomisation process is the most common technique
for fabricating metal powders. Atomisation can be
defined as the break-up of a liquid (superheated) metal
stream into fine droplets and their subsequent freezing
into solid particles, typically smaller than 150 µm.Water atomisation gained commercial importance in
the 1950's when it was applied to the production of iron
and stainless steels powders. Today, water atomisation
is the dominant technique for high-volume, low-cost
metal powder production. The main reasons for using the
technique are low production costs, good green strength
due to irregular powder shape, microcrystalline structure,
high degree of supersaturation, the possibility of
forming metastable phases, no macrosegregation and that
the particle microstructure and shape can be controlled
by the atomisation variables.During the water atomisation process a vertical
stream of liquid metal is disintegrated by the crossfire
of high pressure water jets. The liquid metal droplets
solidify within a fraction of a second and are collected
at the bottom of the atomising tank. The tank is
often purged with an inert gas, such as nitrogen or argon,
to minimise the oxidation of the powder surfaces.
After dewatering the powders are dried and in some cases
annealed, whereby the surface oxides formed are at least
partly reduced. The main disadvantage with water atomisation
is the powder surface oxidation. This disadvantage
is even more pronounced when the powder contains 
easily oxidisable elements such as Cr, Mn, V, Nb, B, Si,
etc.Because of the fact that the possibilities of subsequent
refining of water-atomised powders are very limited,
the conventional way of producing stainless material
(% Cr > 12%) from a water-atomised steel powder
usually requires very pure and accordingly very expensive
raw materials e.g. pure scrap or selected scrap. A
frequently used raw material for the addition of chromium
is ferrochrome (ferrochromium), which is available
in different qualities containing different amounts of
carbon, the qualities containing least carbon being the
most expensive. As it is often required that the carbon
content of the final powder should not exceed 0.03% the
most expensive ferrochrome quality or selected
