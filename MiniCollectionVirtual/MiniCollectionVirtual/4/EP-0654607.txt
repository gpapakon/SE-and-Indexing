<ABSTRACT>
The sealing box especially for a pump for pumping liquid at high temperature and high pressure, the pump being made of a body and of a shaft, is characterised in that its pumping device (50) comprises a male driving element (51) which is designed to be rendered rotationally integral about an axis ( DELTA ) with the shaft and which has a continuous cylindrical external wall (510) and a female volute chamber element (52) which is designed to be fastened rigidly to the body and which has a cylindrical internal wall (520) locally bearing a ring of projecting ribs (521) which have an overall direction not orthogonal to the axis ( DELTA ) and which together with the external wall (510) of the male element (51) delimit a gap (522) of determined radial magnitude. Application in particular to nuclear electric power stations.

<CLAIMS>
Sealing box, more particularly one for a pump which
delivers liquid at high temperature and at high

pressure and which is made from a body and a
rotating shaft which passes through said body and

drives turbine blades, comprising a mechanical
gland, a cooling circuit, an integrated cooling

system and a circulation pumping device
incorporated in respect of said cooling circuit and

comprising a male carrier element (51) which is
designed to be rigidly joined in rotation to the

shaft along an axis (D) and, at least partially
surrounding said male element (51), a female

diffuser element (52) which is designed to be made
fast with the body, characterised in that the male

carrier element (51) features a continuous
cylindrial external wall (510) and the female

diffuser element (52) features a cylindrical
internal wall (520) bearing locally on its surface

a ring of projecting ribs (521) which lie in a
non-orthogonal general direction to the axis (D)

and which with the external wall (510) of the male
element (51) delimit a clearance (522) of a given

radial value.
Box according to claim 1, characterised in that the
external wall (510) of the male element (51) is

smooth. 
Box according to claim 1, characterised in that the
external wall (510) of the male element (51) is

rough.
Box according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the projecting ribs (521) are

helicoid teeth.
Box according to claim 4, characterised in that the
width of the teeth is different from the interval

(5210) which separates them.
Box according to any of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the clearance (522) is more

particularly comprised between approximately 0.5
and 1.3 mm.
Box according to any of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the axial span of the ring of

projecting ribs (521) is in the order of
approximately one-tenth of the length of the

internal wall (510) of the female element (52).
Use of a box according to any of claims 1 to 7 with
a feed pump, more particularly one belonging to an

a.c. turbo-generator of a conventional thermal
electric or even nuclear power station.
