<ABSTRACT>
Ground anomalies in electronic circuit component test 
equipment are identified by a circuit arrangement which 

continuously monitors the integrity af a ground potential 
connection to the travel path, and provides both a visual 

display and an audible alarm in the event of a prescribed 
degradation in ground potential at any of a plurality of 

monitored locations along the travel path. A resistance 
monitoring circuit contains a plurality of voltage dividers 

that are coupled to respective ones of plural locations 
along the part's travel path through the handler. Each 

voltage divider monitors the effective resistance to ground 
at a respective location within the handler. A scanner unit 

sequentially couples the voltage divider outputs to a 
comparator. If the output of a respective voltage divider 

indicates an effective resistance in excess of the 
prescribed reference value, a 'ground anomaly' signal is 

generated, which causes an audible alarm to be generated by 
an attendant audible alarm unit, thereby alerting 

processing personnel of the need to take the parts handler 
ou
t of service for repair/corrective action. In order to 
locate where, along the travel path within in the handler, 

the defect has been detected, the resistance monitoring 
circuit further includes first and second sets of red and 

green indicator lights. The output of the comparator unit 
is used to control the illumination of each red and green 

light pair in dependence upon the output of their 
associated resistance measurement device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to electronic 
circuit component test equipment, and is particularly 
directed to an arrangement for monitoring the integrity of 
a ground potential connection to the travel path of 
electronic circuit components through a test and 
measurement apparatus. In order to minimize, and hopefully prevent, the 
occurrence of a potentially damaging electrostatic 
discharge between an electronic circuit component and 
various contact locations along its travel path through a 
component handling (test) apparatus, it is customary 
practice to provide ground connections to all parts of the 
apparatus that make direct contact with the part. Such 
ground connections are diagrammatically illustrated in 
Figure 1 as comprising one or more conductive straps or 
cables 11 that physically and electrically join various 
locations 12 along the travel path 13 of parts 14 through 
the handler 15 and a relatively 'robust' ground reference, 
such as the metallic framework 16 of the handler. The 
handler itself may also be externally connected to earth 
ground 17 in order to ensure proper grounding of its 
internal framework.  Unfortunately, even with the provision of such 
grounding connections, over time, physical motion and 
vibration that occur during the use of the parts handler 
can be expected to impact the integrity of the ground at 
one or more locations along the travel path. One way to 
address this problem would be to periodically (e.g. daily) 
open up the handler so as to gain access to and manually 
check the entirety of the part travel path for grounding 
anomalies. However, even with this approach, should the 
ground then degrade, the earliest the problem might be 
discovered would not be until the next check interval (e.g. 
the next day). In the meantime, all parts processed by the 
handler during the previous day would be suspect as 
potentially defective. In accordance with the present invention, the above-described 
grounding anomaly problem that exists in 
electronic circuit component test equipment is successfully 
addressed by a circuit arrangement which effectively 
continuously monitors the integrity of a ground potential 
connection to the travel path, and provides an output 
signal (both a visual display and an audible alarm) in the 
event of a prescribed degradation in ground potential at 
any of a plurality of monitored locations along the travel 
path.  For this purpose, the present invention is comprised 
of a resistance monitoring circuit arrangement that
