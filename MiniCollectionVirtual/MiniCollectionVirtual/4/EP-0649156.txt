<ABSTRACT>
An electrical apparatus is formed by connecting in series a circuit breaker (12) and an actuator (14). Switching of the arc on an electrode (38) upon triggering the mechanism following a fault causes shunting of the actuator (14). The electrode (38) is separated from the fixed contact (20) by an insulation gap (42), which is dimensioned to promote the said switching of the arc on the electrode (38) at the start of the opening travel of the moving contact (22), and to guarantee the dielectric strength in the closed state of the contacts (20, 22) of the circuit breaker (12), and in the open state of the actuator (14).

An electrical protection apparatus (10, 100) formed by association of a circuit
breaker (12, 102) and an effector (14, 104),


the circuit breaker (12, 102) comprising a first switch circuit (16) with stationary and
movable contacts (20, 22; 120, 122; 220, 222), a mechanism (43) controlled by an

electromagnetic trip device (36, 136) with an operating coil (34, 134) and by a thermal
trip device (26, 126), a pair of first and second arc guiding horns (30, 40; 130, 140)

associated with a switching electrode (38, 138, 238), arranged near the contacts of
the first switch circuit (16), an arc extinguishing chamber (45, 145) in the trip devices

circuit, an input terminal (28, 128, 228), and an output terminal (32, 132, 232),
the effector (14, 104) having a second switch circuit (18, 118, 218) arranged to be
electrically connected in series with said first switch circuit when the latter is in the

closed state, and to be automatically shunted by switching of the arc onto the
electrode (38, 138, 238) when the mechanism (43) tips following a fault,

characterized in that :

the switching electrode (38, 138) is separated from the stationary contact (20, 120)

stationary contact (20) of the first switch circuit (16, 116), and to said end (34a) of the

coil (34),
the insulating gap (42) is shaped to enhance high-speed migration of the arc root
onto the electrode (38, 138) when opening of the circuit breaker (12, 112) on a fault

occurs and to guarantee the dielectric withstand in the closed state of the circuit
breaker, and in the open state of the effector.

insulating gap (42) is composed of a first air space (70) situated between the lower

part of the stationary contact (20) and the electrode (38) in the shape of a half-loop,
and of an intermediate wall (72) made of rigid insulating material acting as support for 

the stationary contact (20), said wall extending opposite the movable contact (22)
between the stationary contact (20) and a conducting branch (76) extending the

electrode (38) towards the end (34a) of the coil (34).
The electrical protection apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in that the
electrode (38) is provided with an appreciably straight face (78) located in the

extension of the plane of the stationary contact pad (20) associated with the first
switch circuit (16).
