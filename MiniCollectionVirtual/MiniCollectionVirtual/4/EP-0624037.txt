<ABSTRACT>
In an image coding and decoding device, input 
digital image signals are divided into blocks of prescribed 

size, and coding processing is performed to differential 
signal taken between the input block signal and interframe 

forcasting signal thereby transmission recording is 
performed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image coding
and decoding device, and more particularly to an image
coding and decoding device which can efficiently code
and decode the motion image signals so as to transmit
and record the signals by the interframe coding.FIG. 2 shows an example of an image coding method
in the prior art. In FIG. 2, the side A indicates the
transmitting side and the side B indicates the receiving
side.In FIG. 2, numeral 601 designates an input buffer
which inputs the digitized image signals and outputs
them suitably to the coding section at the next stage,
numeral 603 designates a frame memory which stores the
image signals after coding and decoding before the
present image signals by one frame, numeral 602
designates a subtractor which carries out the subtraction
between the output of the input buffer 601 and the output
of the frame memory 603, numeral 604 designates a
quantization coding device which gives the quantization
and coding to the output of the frame memory 603, numeral
605 designates a quantization decoding device which
decodes the signals after the quantization coding, numeral
606 designates an interframe adder which adds the
quantization decoding output and the output of the frame
memory 603, and writes the result to the frame memory
603, numeral 607 designates a variable length coding
device which assigns the variable length code to the
quantization coding output corresponding to the
generating frequency of each code, numeral 608 designates
a transmitting buffer which stores the variable length
coding output, numeral 609 designates a transmitting
buffer control section which monitors the control of 
writing and reading in the transmitting buffer 608 and
the storage amount of the transmitting buffer and then
transmits the monitoring result to the input buffer 601,
numeral 610 designates a dummy data adding section which
adds the dummy data to the output of the transmitting
buffer, and numeral 611 designates a line interface
section.Numeral 612 designates a line interface section on
the receiving side, numeral 613 designates a dummy
separating section which deletes the added dummy data,
numeral 614 designates a variable length decoding
section which decodes the variable length code, numeral
615 designates a receiving buffer which stores the
signals after the variable length decoding, numeral 605'
is a quantization decoding section which gives the
quantization decoding to the output of the receiving
buffer 615, numeral 603' designates a frame memory which
stores the
