<ABSTRACT>
A device for cooling rolled strips, in particular for laminar strip cooling in the rolling of aluminium strips, is easy to maintain and operate and versatile if cooling segments (1;100) closed at the ends by a cover (16) have a gap (11) for the medium extending over its entire length (17;18) and if a plurality of cooling segments (1;100) with a gap (11) for the medium extending without a transition from cooling segment (1) to cooling segment (100) can be arranged next to one another.

<CLAIMS>
Device for cooling roll strips, especially for laminar cooling 
of aluminium strips during rolling, consisting of individual, 

exchangeable cooling segments (1; 100) permitting a zonal cooling, 
characterised thereby that cooling segments (1; 100) closed at the 

end faces by a cover (16) have a medium gap (11) extending over their 
entire length (17; 18) and several cooling segments (1; 100) with a 

medium gap (11) transition-free from cooling segment (1) to cooling 
segment (100) are able to be lined up together. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the 
covers (16) are inserted flushly, whilst leaving the medium gap (11) 

free, into a base body 92) provided with a continuous distributor 
bore (8), which has at least one supply connection (12) and goes over 

into the medium gap (11). 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby that the 
base body (2) has a cutout (6), which axially exposes the distributor 

bore (8), with an inclined guide surface (9) which forms the medium 
gap (11) in co-operation with a slide wedge (3) arranged in the 

cutout(6) and having a corresponding guide surface (10). 
Device according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
thereby that the slide wedge (3) projects into the distributor bore 

(8) by an upstream nose (7). 
Device according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
thereby that the gap width of the medium gap (11) is individually 

settable at each cooling segment (1; 100). 
Device according to claim 5, characterised thereby that insert 
blocks (19) firmly arranged in the base body (2) engage in grooves 

(20) associated therewith in the slide wedge (3) and are provided in 
the region of the grooves (20) with a setting screw (21) accessible 

from the outside.  
 
Device according to one of more of claims 1 to 6, characterised 
thereby that the cooling segments (1; 100) are screw-connected with a 

steel construction (13) receiving them in boxlike manner.
