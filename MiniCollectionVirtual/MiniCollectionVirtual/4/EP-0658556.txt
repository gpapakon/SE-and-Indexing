<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a piperidine compound 
and a stabilized polymeric material composition 
containing said compound. More particularly, it 
relates to a specific cyanurate derivative having a 
2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidyl group and a stabilized 
polymeric material composition which has been improved 
particularly in heat resistance, non-extractibility 
and light resistance by incorporating said derivative 
therein. It is known that polymeric materials such as 
polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride are 
generally susceptible to light and suffer from, for 
example, degradation, color changes or deterioration 
in mechanical strength due to the action of light, 
which makes them unable to withstand prolonged use. Accordingly, there have been employed various 
stabilizers in order to protect these polymeric 
materials from deterioration caused by light and it 
has been proposed to use a number of compounds having  
 
a 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidyl group in its molecule 
for this purpose. Among these piperidine compounds, cyanurate 
derivatives are relatively excellent in the heat 
resistance of the compounds per se and thus it has 
been proposed to use several of these compounds 
hitherto. For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 
21389/1974 has proposed to use cyanurate derivatives 
of piperidine compounds. However, the compounds 
described in this patent are low-molecular weight ones 
and thus have several disadvantages such that they are 
liable to be vaporized during the processing of 
polymeric materials or easily extracted with water or 
organic solvents. To solve this problem, high-molecular weight 
compounds have been proposed by, for example, Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open No. 73886/1977, No. 47030/1983, No. 
194931/1983, No. 122487/1984 and No. 81441/1986. 
Further, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 176662/1986 has 
proposed to use a cyanurate derivative of a diamine 
having an ether group in its molecule. However, these 
compounds are still insufficient in stabilizing effect 
and cannot be satisfactorily used in practice. Under these circumstances, the present inventors  
 
have conducted extensive studies and consequently 
found out that a stabilized polymeric material 
composition being excellent in heat resistance, 
non-extractibility and light resistance can be 
obtained by adding a specific cyanurate derivative 
having an ether bond, thus completing the present 
invention. Accordingly, the present invention provides a 
piperidine compound represented by the following 
general
