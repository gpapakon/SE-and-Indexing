<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a relay valve for a 
fluid pressure braking system. Tractor-trailer combination vehicles are equipped 
with braking systems in which a vehicle operator generates a 
control signal by operation of the brake control valve in 
the operator's compartment. This control signal is 
transmitted to relay valves, which respond to the control 
signal to communicate compressed air from storage reservoirs 
to vehicle foundation brakes. The control signal must be 
communicated to the relay valves on the trailer through a 
pneumatic conduit which connects the tractor and the 
trailer. More recently, so-called "turnpike trains" have 
become common, in which a single tractor pulls two or three 
trailers. Accordingly, the control signal generated by the 
vehicle operator must be transmitted through the first 
trailer to operate relay valves on the second and even a 
third trailer. However, when the control signal reaches the 
second and third trailers, it has become so slowed that 
unstable braking may result. Accordingly, it has become 
necessary to use pilot relay valves on the trailers to speed 
up the control signal. In other words, the control signal 
is used to operate a pilot relay valve, the outlet of which 
becomes the control signal transmitted to that trailer and 
each succeeding trailer. Obviously, it is desirable that 
such pilot relay valves used to generate control signals 
have an extremely small pressure differential between the 
control port and the outlet or delivery port, to provide 
nearly equal pressure at all brakes. It is also desirable 
that such relay valves react as quickly as possible to the 
control signal transmitted to the control port to minimize 
time delay. Accordingly, it is desirable that the crack-open 
pressure, at which such a relay valve opens, be as 
small as possible to provide adequate responsive control 
during braking. Pressure responsive relay valves in which a 
biasing force is controlled by pressure at a port are 
disclosed in FR-A-2 274 466.  
 Thus FR-A-2274466 discloses a relay valve 
comprising a housing having an inlet port, an outlet port, 
an exhaust port, and a control port, valve means for 
controlling communication between said inlet port, said 
outlet port, and said exhaust port, a relay piston slidably 
mounted in said housing and responsive to the pressure level 
at said control port for operating said valve means, a 
pressure responsive biasing means supplying a biasing force 
on said relay piston independently of the pressure level

<CLAIMS>
Relay valve comprising a housing (12) having 
an inlet port (38), an outlet port (24), an exhaust port 

(52), and a control port (20), valve means (58,62,64) for 
controlling communication between said inlet port (38), said 

outlet port (24), and said exhaust port (52), a relay piston 
(16) slidably mounted in said housing (12) and responsive to 

the pressure level at said control port (20) for operating 
said valve means (58,62,64), a pressure responsive biasing 

means (34,42) applying a biasing force on said relay piston 
(16) independently of the pressure level at said control 

port (20, characterized in that said valve means (58,62,64) 
includes a pressure responsive surface (70) responsive to 

the fluid pressure level at the inlet port (38), said relay 
piston (16) transmitting the biasing force applied by said 

pressure responsive biasing means (34,42) to said valve 
means (58,62,64), the force of fluid pressure acting on said 

fluid pressure responsive surface (70) opposing the variable 
biasing force of said pressure responsive biasing means 

(34,42). 
Relay valve as claimed in Claim 1, further 
characterized in that the biasing force varies as a function 

of the pressure level at the inlet port (38). 
Relay valve as claimed in Claims 1, further 
characterized in that said pressure responsive biasing means 

(34,42) includes a fluid pressure effective area responsive 
to the pressure level at said inlet port (38), said variable 

biasing force being generated by the fluid pressure at said 
inlet port (38) acting against said effective area. 
Relay valve as claimed in any of Claims 1-3, 
further characterized in that the size of the pressure 

responsive surface (70) on the valve means (58,62,64) is 
larger than the size of the effective area of the pressure 

responsive biasing means (34,42). 
Relay valve as claimed in any of Claims 1-3, 
further characterized in that said valve means (58,62,64) 

includes a spring device (60) yieldably urging said valve 
means (58,62,64) to a position closing said inlet port (38)  

 
and acting on said valve means (58,62,64) in the same 

direction as the fluid pressure acting against said pressure 
responsive surface (70) and opposite to the force applied to 

said valve means (58,62,64) by said biasing means (34,42). 
Relay valve as claimed in any of Claims 1-3, 
further characterized in that said valve means (58,62,64) 

includes a spring device (60) yieldably urging said valve 
means (58,62,64) to a position closing said inlet port (38)
