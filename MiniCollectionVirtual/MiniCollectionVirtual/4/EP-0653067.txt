<ABSTRACT>
A method of assaying bone collagen degradation activity in a human subject. In the method, a human urine sample is reacted with a monoclonal antibody which (i) is capable of reacting immunospecifically with pyridinium crosslinks selected from the group consisting of native free pyridinoline and native free deoxypyridinoline, and (ii) has a ratio of reactivity toward the selected pyridinium crosslinks and urinary pyridinium peptides larger than 1,000 daltons in molecular weight, of greater than about 5:1. An immunocomplex forms between the antibody reagent and the selected pyridinium crosslinks which are present in the sample, and the amount of immunocomplex is measured. Also disclosed are antibody reagents and kits which can be used in the method.

which are characterized by a high level of bone
resorption and by an abnormal balance between bone
formation and bone resorption. Among the more
common of these are osteoporosis, Paget's disease,
and conditions related to the progress of benign
and malignant tumors of the bone and metastatic
cancers which have been transferred to bone cells
from, for example, prostate or breast initial
tumors. Other conditions which are associated
with changes in collagen metabolism include
osteomalacial diseases, rickets, abnormal growth
in children, renal osteodystrophy, and a drug-induced
osteopenia. Irregularities in bone
metabolism are often side effects of thyroid
treatments and thyroid conditions per se, such as
primary hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis as well
as Cushing's disease.It has been recognized that disorders of bone
resorption or other conditions characterized by an
abnormal balance between bone formation and bone
resorption can be detected by altered levels of 
pyridinium crosslinks in
