<CLAIMS>
A process for coproduction of dicarboxylic acids
and diamines from


(a) polymers based on polyamides of dicarboxylic acids
or their derivatives with diamines, or
(b) materials comprising essentially such polymers,

by cracking these polymers into their monomeric constituents
using a base in an aqueous medium and removing the

resulting diamines, characterized in that the base is
dissolved in a mixture of from 100 to 75% by weight of

water and from 0 to 25% by weight of a C
1
-C
4
-alkanol and
the resulting dicarboxylic acid salts of adipic acid or

sebacic acid are converted into the corresponding
dicarboxylic acids and bases by electrochemical means.
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that the electrochemical conversion is carried out in a

three- or four-part membrane electrolysis cell at a
temperature within the range from 65 to 90°C.
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that the electrochemical conversion is carried out in a

three-compartment electrodialysis unit at a temperature
within the range from 40 to 110°C.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the adipic acid or sebacic acid is

crystallized out from its solutions resulting from the
electrochemical treatment.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the base obtained from the electrochemical

treatment is used for cracking the polymers into
their monomeric constituents.
The use of the process of any of claims 1 to 5
for regenerative cracking of polyamides into their

monomeric constituents.
