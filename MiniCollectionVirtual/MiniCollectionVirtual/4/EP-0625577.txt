<ABSTRACT>
Novel vectors are disclosed for expressing and 
secreting heterologous polypeptides from filamentous 

fungi. Such vectors are used in novel processes to 
express and secrete such heterologous polypeptides. 

The vectors used for transforming a filamentous fungus 
to express and secrete a heterologous polypeptide 

include a DNA sequence encoding a heterologous 
polypeptide and a DNA sequence encoding a signal 

sequence which is functional in a secretory system in 
a given filamentous fungus and which is operably 

linked to the sequence encoding the heterologous 
polypeptide. Such signal sequences may be the signal 

sequence normally associated with the heterologous 
polypeptides or may be derived from other sources. 

The vector may also contain DNA sequences encoding a 
promoter sequence which is functionally recognized by 

the filamentous fungus and which is operably linked to 
the DNA sequence encoding the signal sequence. 

Preferably functional polyadenylation sequences are 
operably linked to the 3' terminus of the DNA sequence 

encoding the heterologous polypeptides. Each of the 
above described vectors are used in novel processes to 

transform a filamentous fungus wherein the DNA 
sequences encoding the signal sequence and 

heterologous polypeptide are expressed. The thus 
synthesized polypeptide is thereafter secreted from 

the filamentous fungus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to heterologous 
polypeptides expressed and secreted by filamentous 
fungi and to vectors and processes for expressing and 
secreting such polypeptides. More particularly, the 
invention discloses transformation vectors and 
processes using the same for expressing and secreting 
biologically active bovine chymosin and heterologous 
glucoamylase by a filamentous fungus. The expression of DNA sequences encoding heterologous 
polypeptides (i.e., polypeptides not normally 
expressed and secreted by a host organism) has 
advanced to a state of considerable sophistication. 
For example, it has been reported that various DNA 
sequences encoding pharmacologically desirable 
polypeptides [e.g., human growth hormone (1), human 
tissue plasminogen activator (2), various human 
interferons (6), urokinase (5), Factor VIII (4), and 
human serum albumin (3)] and industrially important 
enzymes [e.g., chymosin (7), alpha amylases (8), and  
 
alkaline proteases (9)] have been cloned and expressed 
in a number of different expression hosts. Such 
expression has been achieved by transforming 
prokaryotic organisms [e.g., E. coli (10) or B. 
subtilis (11)] or eukaryotic organisms [e.g., 
Saccharomycescerevisiae (7), Kluyveromyceslactis 
(12) or Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (2)] with 
DNA sequences encoding the heterologous polypeptide. Some polypeptides, when expressed in heterologous 
hosts, do not have the same level of biological 
activity as their naturally produced counterparts when 
expressed in various host organisms. For example, 
bovine chymosin has very low biological activity when 
expressed by E. coli (13) or S. cerevisiae (7). This 
reduced biological activity in E. coli is not due to 
the natural inability of E. coli to glycosylate the 
polypeptide since chymosin is not normally 
glycosylated (14). Such relative inactivity, both in 
E. coli and S. cerevisiae, however, appears to be 
primarily due to improper folding of the polypeptide 
chain as evidenced by the partial post expression 
activation of such expressed polypeptides by various 
procedures. In such procedures, expressed chymosin 
may be sequentially denatured and renatured in a 
number of ways to increase biological activity: e.g., 
treatment with urea (13), exposure to denaturing/renaturing 
pH (13) and denaturation and cleavage of 
disulfide bonds followed by renaturation and 
regeneration of covalent sulfur linkages (15). Such 
denaturation/renaturation procedures, however, are not 
highly efficient [e.g., 30% or
