<ABSTRACT>
A drinking mug, especially for small children, handicapped and hospital patients, comprising a cup (1), a lid (3) and a suction tube (5), is configured in an airtight manner so that the only access to the inside of the mug is through the suction tube (5). Tightness is achieved by disposing the suction tube (5) on the inside of the lid (3) on a drinking spout (15), and by providing a sealing ring (29) in the joint between the lid (3) and the cup (1). Due to the airtight construction, when liquid is sucked up an underpressure is created inside the mug which subsequently empties the suction tube of liquid. Correspondingly, an attempt by the liquid to run out through the suction tube (5) when the mug is tipped over is counteracted by the siphon effect which results from the airtight construction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a drinking mug comprising a cup, a lid and at
least one suction tube. Such drinking mugs, which are arranged to prevent
spillage, are for example used for small children, the handicapped
and hospital patients.In addition to the mug being able to avoid the spillage of liquids,
for example if it is tipped over, it is desirable for the mug to be of
low weight, easy to use, easy to clean and able to be produced at low
cost.A mug of the kind described above is disclosed in US Patent No.
2,914,214, where the suction tube is secured to the lid, in that the
mouth of the suction tube is found at the lid or over the lid outside
the mug. On the lid there are two diametrically arranged mouthpieces
each with a suction tube. The suction tubes extend right down towards
the bottom, but are hereafter extended in an arc upwards towards the
lid, in that the inlet to the suction tubes turns towards the lid or
towards a space between two concentric walls in the cup. Although this
mug is intended to prevent pillage, the liquid which stands in the
lower most tube will run out because the uppermost tube functions as
an air valve. A second and more significant disadvantage is that the
tubes must be long and curved in order to be able to function as
intended. This means a relatively complicated construction which is
expensive to produce. Moreover, if disposable suction tubes are not
used, the suction tubes will be difficult to clean which will result
in bacterial growth, which is unacceptable in connection with the use
of the mug by small children.GB 2,120,218 describes a drinking vessel comprising a cup, a lid and a
drinking straw intended for insertion through the lid. The lid is
provided with snap-on lugs which secure the lid to a rim at the top of
the cup. In the lid a push-in aperture comprising one or several
closure flaps are provided. When liquid is to be sucked from the cup
through the drinking straw the drinking straw is inserted through the
push-in aperture thereby deflecting the closure flaps. All though the
lid of the drinking vessel is intended for closing the vessel in order
not to have any liquid spilt, this is only achieved to a limited 
extent. If e.g. the drinking vessel by accident is tilted, the liquid
will be running out throguh the drinking straw and perhaps also through
the push-in aperture as this does not abut on the drinking
straw in a tight manner. Because of this great disadvantage of th
drinking vessel described in the above-mentioned publication, i.e. the
closure flaps not
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Drinking mug comprising a cup, a lid and at least one suction tube
which extends from a mouth at the top side of the cup, which suction

tube is substantially straight between its mouth and its inlet inside
the mug, said inlet inside the mug being disposed at a relatively

short distance over the bottom, 
characterized
 in that the
mug is configured with gastight joints, that a partial vacuum is

established inside the mug when liquid is sucked from the interior of
the mug through the suction tube, and that flow of air to the interior

of the mug takes place exclusively through the suction tube.
Drinking mug according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in
that a sealing ring is provided in the joint between the lid and the

mug.
Drinking mug according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in
that in the joint between the lid and the mug there is an airtight fit

between mutually abutting parts of the lid and the mug.
Drinking mug according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized

in that the bottom of the mug has at least one recess
positioned in such a manner that the inlet to the suction tube is

disposed opposite to and down in the recess.
Drinking mug according to claim 4, 
characterized
 in
that the recess is annular and positioned symmetrically in the bottom.
Drinking mug according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized

in that the lid can be secured on the mug by means of
two or more bayonet locks.
Drinking mug according to claim 6, 
characterized
 in
that the bayonet locks are configured with lateral pins which extend

towards each other from the wall of the mug, and where cutouts are
provided in the lid, said cutouts being configured to cooperate with

the pins upon the mutual turning of lid and mug so that the pins
actuates a flexible portion at the cutouts until the pins have passed

a top point on the portions, where the pins assume a locking position 
in relation to the cutouts, where from said locking

position no further movement can be made in the same
direction, and in that turning in the opposite

direction can only be effected by overcoming a force
which arises with the passage by the pins of the top

point in the opposite direction.
Drinking mug according to any of the preceding claims,

characterized
 in that the lid constitutes
the bottom of the mug, and in that the cup is

configured with a closed top side with the exception of
the mouth of the suction tube which is disposed at or

in the top side of the cup.
Drinking mug according to claim 8
, characteri
zed
 in that the suction tube is configured as a
channel which extends through a thicker part of the

side of the cup.
Drinking mug according to any of the preceding
claims, 
characterized
 in that it is
provided with a commonly-known air valve for the

equalisation of an over-pressure on the inside of the
mug which can arise particularly when the lid is being

put on the cup.
