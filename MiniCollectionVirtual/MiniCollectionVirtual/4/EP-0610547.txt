<CLAIMS>
Stand for storing flat, rectangular objects (5), in particular the cases of information
carriers such as CDS, music cassettes or video cassettes with two side wall components (1a, 1b)

enclosing an angle between themselves and serving at least to form a compartment, in which the
objects (5) are held by their sides,

characterized by the fact that the side wall components (1a, 1b) hold and/or support the objects
(5) at least in the area of the ends of one of their diagonals (6) with their interdependent, lateral

arrangement, that the faces of the side elements turned towards the object are arranged at an
angle (α) greater than 90° in relation to each other and that between the side wall elements (1a,

1b) bar-shaped supports (2) for the objects (5) are arranged, extending largely horizontally to
form compartments, and within the area of the diagonals (6) of the objects (5) slotted in

diagonally between the side wall components the bar-shaped elements are directed slightly
towards the vertex of the angle (α).
Stand as per claim 1

characterized by the fact that the angle (α) contained between the two side wall components (1a,
1b) lies between 100° and 110°.
Stand as per claim 1 or 2,

characterized by the fact that the side wall components (1a, 1b); starting from the fixing point
(4a, 4b) of the supports (2) only, extend over part of the area between the fixing point (4a, 4b) and

the vertex (4) of the angle (α) formed between the two side wall components (1a, 1b).
Stand as per one of claims 1 to 3,

characterized by the fact that at least the faces of the side wall components (1a, 1b) turned
towards the objects (5) are partially interrupted or consist of individual elements, whereby they

form the lateral rest for the objects (5).
Stand as per one of claims 1 to 4,

characterized by the fact that in the side wall components (1a, 1b) to accommodate the bar-shaped
elements (2) at equal intervals corresponding to the height ofthe objects (5) to be stacked,

fixing apertures (3a, 3b) are arranged vertically, one above the other.
Stand as per one of claims 1 to 5,

characterized by the fact that the supports (2) in the form of bar-shaped elements are made of
rods which are inserted into the holes (3a, 3b) in the side wall components (1a, 1b) and extend

between the two side wall elements (1a, 1b).
Stand as per one of claims 1 to 6,

characterized by the fact that the bar-shaped elements (2) which form the supports for the objects
(5) are made of a rope, wire or similar. 
Stand as per one of claims 1 to 7,

characterized by the fact that where the construction of the fixing apertures (3a, 3b) penetrates
right through the side wall components (1a, 1b); the rope (2), wire or similar is threaded through

them in a zigzag running backwards and forwards continuously from top to bottom or from
bottom to top to form compartments.
Stand as per claims 1 to 8

characterized by the fact that the bar-shaped elements (2) are preferably made of plastic or coated
with plastic, whereby their surface hardness is less than that of the object (5) to be stacked.
