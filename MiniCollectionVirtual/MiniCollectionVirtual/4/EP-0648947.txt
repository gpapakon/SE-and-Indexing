<ABSTRACT>
A device (
26
) for adjusting the length of 
either the core element (
14
) or the conduit (
12
) in 
a motion transmitting remote control assembly (
10
) 
includes an elongated member (
28
) and a housing 
(
30
) for axially movably receiving the elongated 
member (
28
). A thumb-controlled locking device 
(
32
, 
68
) locks and unlocks the elongated member 
(
28
) within the housing (
30
). A latch (
34
) holds 
the locking device (
32
, 
68
) in position. The latch 
(
34
) forms a spring-loaded cover (
92
) surrounding 
the locking device (
32
). An operator must manually 
displace the cover (
92
) before actuating the 
locking device (
32
).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a motion
transmitting remote control assembly of the type
for transmitting motion in a curved path by a
flexible motion transmitting core element, and more
particularly to such an assembly including a device
for adjusting the length of the core element or
conduit.Motion-transmitting remote control
assemblies must be secure, yet adjustable for
adjusting the relative length of the core element
and conduit in those assemblies. Adjustment is
necessary at installation to insure proper
operation of a remotely controlled device through
its required mechanical range of control. Periodic
maintenance adjustments are also necessary to
compensate for slippage and non-elastic deformation
of a conduit or core element. It is important,
therefore, that the adjustment means be easily
adjusted and readjusted. It is also important that
the adjustment means be secure; i.e., difficult to
inadvertently disengage or engage. Inadvertent
disengagement can cause loss of control. In
certain applications, inadvertent engagement can
cause damage or injury through unplanned activation
and improper adjustment/regulation of a controlled
device. Inadvertent engagement can also cause
costly delays in assembly line processes that
depend, for speed, on adjustment devices arriving 
from the manufacturer in a disengaged, ready-to-install
state.Unfortunately, current adjustment means
that provide ease of adjustment are also relatively
easy to disengage and/or engage inadvertently. A
typical device allows disengagement with a single
motion. The device may provide some type of
securing means to hold it in a locked position, but
this type of securing means is often overrideable
by application of the same force and motion that
would disengage the locking means.For example, United States Patent Number
5,156,064 to Truman, issued October 20, 1992
discloses a cable length adjustment device
comprising an elongated member, a locking member,
and a housing. The housing is typically joined to,
or integral with, one length of a control cable
with the elongated member joined to or integral
with a second length of the same control cable.
The housing has a central bore formed to
accommodate the end of the elongated member
opposite the end attached to the second length of
control cable. The housing also holds the locking
member which an operator may reposition from either
side of the housing. There is a bore through the
longitudinal axis of the locking member to allow an
operator to position the elongated member within
the locking
