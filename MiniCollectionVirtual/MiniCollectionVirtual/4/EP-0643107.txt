<CLAIMS>
A process for dyeing polyester or polyester-containing
textile materials at pH 8 to pH 11, characterized

in that one or more monoazo dyes of the general
formula I



where

Hal
is chlorine or bromine,
R
is (C
2
-C
5
)-alkyl,
x
is hydrogen, methoxy or ethoxy and
R1 and R2
are allyl

are used.
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that X is methoxy or ethoxy.
A process as claimed in claim 1 and/or 2,
characterized in that it is carried out in an aqueous

dyeing liquor in a dyeing autoclave under HT conditions
at temperatures between 120°C and 140°C.
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1
to 3, characterized in that it is carried out at pH 9

to pH 10. 
Monoazo dyes of the general formula Ia


where

Hal
is chlorine or bromine,
R
is (C
2
-C
5
)-alkyl and
x
is hydrogen, methoxy or ethoxy.
Mixtures of monoazo dyes of the general formula
Ia as set forth in claim 5.
A process for preparing monoazo dyes of the

general formula Ia as set forth in claim 5, characterized
in that an amine of the general formula II



where Hal is as defined in claim 5, is diazotized in a
conventional manner and coupled onto a compound of the

general formula III


where R and X are each as defined in claim 5.
Use of monoazo dyes of the general formula Ia
as set forth in claim 5 and of their mixtures as

claimed in claim 6 for dyeing and printing hydrophobic
textile materials.
