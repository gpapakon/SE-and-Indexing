<ABSTRACT>
In a television receiver a downconverter responding to a selected television signal respectively supplies its first and second output signals as the input signals of first and second IF amplifiers, respectively. The downconverter (12) includes a local oscillator (13) for generating oscillations at a frequency controlled in response to the AFT signal. The first IF amplifier (17) includes a first adjacent-channel sound carrier trap, in consequence whereof the first-IF-amplifier response is substantially reduced for the downconverted picture carrier, and an in-channel sound carrier trap. Responsive to the first-IF-amplifier response, a video detector (18, 19) generates a composite video signal in which sound beats are suppressed to relatively low level by the first adjacent-channel sound carrier trap. A second IF amplifier (21) includes a second adjacent-channel sound carrier trap. The second-IF-amplifier response, from which in-channel sound carrier is not trapped, is not as much reduced for the downconverted picture carrier by the second adjacent-channel sound carrier trap as the first-IF-amplifier response is by the first adjacent-channel sound carrier trap. From the second-IF-amplifier response, intercarrier detection circuitry detects an intercarrier-sound-IF response, which is amplified by an intercarrier sound-IF amplifier (22) and then detected by an FM sound detector (26). Responsive to the second-IF-amplifier response, an automatic fine tuning (AFT) detector generates the AFT signal used to control the frequency of the oscillations generated by the local oscillator (13) that the downconverter includes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to intermediate-frequency (IF)
amplifiers for television signal receivers, as incorporated
in television sets or in television signal recording
apparatus.It is known from US 4,660,087 and EP-A1-0 220 927 to provide SAW-filters to supply
differently filtered intermediate-frequency signals for the sound processing and video
processing.A television signal receiver previously designed by
one of the inventors, suitable for incorporation in a
television set or video recorder, has a downconverter for
responding to a selected television signal to generate
intermediate frequencies including a downconverted
amplitude-modulated video (or picture) carrier and a
downconverted frequency-modulated audio (or sound) carrier.
The downconverter includes a local oscillator for
generating oscillations at a frequency controlled in
response to an automatic fine tuning signal, which
oscillations are heterodyned with the selected television
signal to generate the intermediate frequencies. First and
second output signals are taken from the downconverter by
respective filters.The filter producing the first output signal from the
downconverter selects only the downconverted amplitude-modulated
video carrier, suppressing the downconverted
frequency-modulated audio carrier, and includes a deep
adjacent-channel sound carrier trap. A first intermediate-frequency
amplifier responds to the first downconverter
output signal with a first-IF-amplifier response. A video
detector generates a composite video signal responsive to
the first-IF-amplifier response. This composite video
signal is substantially free of sound beats therein, since
the deep adjacent-channel sound carrier trap suppresses the
adjacent-channel sound carrier in the IF supplied to the
first IF amplifier. This first IF amplifier corresponds to
the conventional video IF amplifier commonly referred to as
a PIX IF amplifier. In recent years, the level of the sound carrier has
been reduced from the level in the original NTSC standard
for television broadcasting, first by cable broadcasters to
reduce intrasystem interference and then by over-the-air
broadcasters. This has tended to make the noise
performance of intercarrier sound systems marginal,
particularly in fringe-area reception of over-the-air
television signals. The relatively deep adjacent-channel
sound carrier trap for suppressing sound beats in the video
detector response arising from an adjacent-channel sound
carrier causes the first-IF-amplifier response to picture
carrier to be reduced 6 dB or
