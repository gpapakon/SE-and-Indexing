<ABSTRACT>
A device for filling a print head (100) of an inkjet printer consists of a holder (4) with a sealing member (7), into which holder the print head (100) can be inserted with little play. The sealing member (7) is directed towards a nozzle plate (103) arranged on the underside of the housing (101) and is brought into sealing contact by means of a retaining member (5) which acts on an edge of the housing of the print head (100). Furthermore, a needle carrier (18) with a needle (17) is present, which can be fitted onto the print head (100) or the holder (4). The needle (17) penetrates via a bore (106) in the print head (100) into an ink supply compartment located inside the print head (100). A refilling cartridge (200) can be fitted onto the needle (17). With the aid of this device, print heads can be filled in a particularly simple and reliable manner. The filling operation proceeds automatically as soon as a closure cap (210) located on the refilling cartridge (200) is removed.

100') under pretension pressed against the sealing device 

(7) and the optionally present sealing device (8). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
further comprising a seal carrier (12') which can be 

mounted on the printing head (100') inserted in the 
holder (4) and which has a sealing member (13') which is 

designed to seal a venting opening (105'). 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in that 
the seal carrier (12') has fixing elements (14') in the 

form of latching hooks which are designed to latch in the 
holder (4) and thereby to hold the sealing member (13') 

pressed under pretension against the venting opening 
(104') and the printing head (100') as a whole against 

the sealing members (7, 8) with increased pretension. 
Device according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized in 
that the holder (4), the seal carrier (12') and the 

hollow-needle carrier (18') are matched to one another in 
regard to their geometrical shape in such a way that they 

can be joined to one another only in a specified 
arrangement. 
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in that 
the holder (4) is divided into at least two parts and  

 
comprises a casing (2) and a holder insert (3), the 

holder insert (3) having, at its upper end, a cuff-shaped 
rim profile (50) having an outwardly pointing profiled 

section (51) which encompasses the casing (2) in an 
overlapping manner in the upper region and, furthermore, 

the profiled section (51) has a circumferential shoulder 
(52) whose inner surface serves as support for the upper 

edge of the casing (2) and whose outer surface serves as 
abutment for the seal carrier (12'). 
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in that 
the seal carrier (12') has, at its lower end, a step-shaped
