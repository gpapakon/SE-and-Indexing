<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to miniature or sub-fractional horsepower 
permanent magnet synchronous motors of the type typically employed for 
operating timing mechanisms and time-based electromechanical programmers. 
The invention relates particularly to such motors employed for operating the 
advance mechanisms and programmers utilized in household appliances such as 
washing machines, clothes driers, and dishwashers. Such motors are also particularly suitable for powering small cooling fans 
employed for cooling electronic circuitry and equipment where compactness is 
required in order to locate the fan directly adjacent the particular electronic 
components such as those mounted on a circuit board. Other applications for 
such motors include aspirators associated with temperature sensing in a flow of 
air and liquid pumps, particularly for highly competitive mass production 
applications such as in automotive sensors and controls. Heretofore, miniature synchronous motors have employed a coil wound 
around a bobbin which is assembled with a rotor and encased in a shell or 
housing which forms a part of the magnetic flux loop about the coil, and which 
may also contain the speed-reducing gear train for power coupling the motor to 
the mechanism to be driven. The known techniques for mounting the motor 
coil in the ferromagnetic stator pieces or housing have resulted in relatively 
expensive assembly operations and complex procedures for attaching the coil 
leads to connector terminals provided on the stator or housing. Therefore, it 
has long been desired to provide an improved design for a miniature 
synchronous timing motor having a minimum volume, and which results in 
reduced manufacturing costs, yet is simple and reliable. The motor of the present invention has a coil bobbin or spool with an 
enlarged end flange extending radially outwardly a substantially greater distance 
than the opposite end flange with a pair of connector terminals received in slots  
 
provided in the enlarged flange. A coil of magnet wire is wound around the 
spool with the ends of the coiled conductor attached to bent-up tabs on the 
connector terminals by winding the ends therearound. The ferromagnetic stator 
means defines a flux loop about the coil and comprises a first stator member 
having a generally cup-shaped configuration with a plurality of axially-extending 
finger-like pole segments disposed in circumferentially spaced arrangement. 
The stator cup is received over the smaller end flange of the spool and the
