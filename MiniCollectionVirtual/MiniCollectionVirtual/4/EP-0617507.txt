<ABSTRACT>
A method for demodulating frequency-modulated signals, filtering being effected by means of low-pass filters and the desired phase increment, and thus the transmitted signal, being subsequently obtained by means of complex multiplication (delay demodulation), characterised in that the sampled received signal is subjected to filtering by means of a band-pass filter and in that this filter exhibits complex-valued coefficients. A very inexpensive method used, in particular, in the demodulation of UHF FM signals.
