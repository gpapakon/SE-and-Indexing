<ABSTRACT>
A numerical controller for an industrial machine such as a 
robot and an assembling system utilizing plural robots. The 

numerical controller controls movements of plural movable 
portions of the industrial machine by a synchronous control in 

which plural movable portions are moved in a synchronized 
manner. Based on an operational program, the numerical 

controller identifies a movable portion or movable portions 
which must be moved independently from other movable portion. 

The identified movable portion or portions are moved by an 
independent control. On the other hand, movable portions which 

are not designated are moved by synchronous control. Further, 
plural groups of movable portions may be formed for the 

synchronous control. In this case, movable portions in each 
group are controlled in a synchronized manner independently from 

other groups.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for
numerically controlling industrial machines such as robots and
machine tools.In a conventional industrial machine such as an articulated
robot (hereinafter referred to as "robot") disclosed in EP-A-0 103 714 and
FR-A-2 611 035, for example, having plural movable
portions which correspond to plural control axes and which are
simultaneously moved to obtain a desired operation, a hand or
the like thereof is moved to pass through predetermined plural
teaching points. In such a control system, each movable portion
is controlled in accordance with a trapezoidal velocity pattern,
as shown in FIG. 1(a) during the time when the hand or the like
is moved between two adjacent teaching points. Namely, a
maximum velocity Vm and a maximum acceleration am are set for
each control axis taking account of the characteristics of a
servomotor used for driving a movable portion corresponding to
the control axis. When the movable portion is moved from a
teaching point P0 to a teaching point P1, it is accelerated at
the maximum acceleration am after the departure from the 
teaching point P0, as shown in FIG. 1(a). When the velocity
reaches the maximum velocity Vm after a lapse of τ seconds, the
movable portion is constantly moved at the velocity Vm. When T
seconds which is a period of time defining the timing of
starting deceleration (the timing will hereinafter be referred
to as "deceleration start time") has elapsed, the movable
portion is decelerated at a deceleration corresponding to the
maximum acceleration αm so that the movable portion reaches the
teaching point P1. In the case where a deceleration start time
T comes before the velocity reaches the maximum velocity Vm even
if the acceleration is made at the maximum acceleration αm, a
triangular velocity pattern shown in FIG. 1(b) is generated to
control the velocity of the movable portion.Although the velocity pattern for each control axis is
generated in the above-described manner, the velocity pattern is
modified so that the hand or the like of the robot is moved
along a moving locus which smoothly connects the plural teaching
points. This makes it possible for an operator to easily image
the moving locus. To obtain such a smooth locus, all of the
movable portions must simultaneously start their movements, and
must stop their movements at the same time. Further, it is
common that the movable portions are controlled to
simultaneously initiate their accelerations and decelerations
and to simultaneously end
