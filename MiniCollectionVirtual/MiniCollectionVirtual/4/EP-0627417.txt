<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of preparing 
ε-caprolactam by depolymerisation of nylon-6 originating 

from carpet wate wherein the mixture of ε-caprolactam and 
water is hydrogenated in the presence of hydrogen and a 

hydrogenation catalyst. The amount of ε-caprolactam in the 
mixture can be between 10 and 95% by weight.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the reclamation of ε-caprolactam
from carpet waste, and more particularly to a
method of purifying contaminated ε-caprolactam dissolved
in water, in which the contaminated ε-caprolactam has been
obtained by means of depolymerisation of nylon-6
originating from carpet waste.Such a method is disclosed in US-A-5169870. Said
patent specification describes a method in which nylon-6
from carpet made from nylon-6 fibers is depolymerised in
the presence of phosphoric acid and steam. The phosphoric
acid serves as depolymerisation catalyst. The carpet is
traditionally composed of nylon-6 tufts and of a, for
example, jute, polypropylene or latex backing. Also, the
latex may contain fillers. The post-consumer carpet will
also contain various sorts of dirt. These materials are
present during depolymerization, due to the difficulty of
fully separating the nylon-6 from the non-nylon-6
material, according to US-A-5169870. This non-nylon-6
material will result in impurities which have to be
removed from the ε-caprolactam in order to obtain ε-caprolactam
reusable for making nylon-6. According to US-A-5169870
this so-called "carpet" ε-caprolactam should be
purified in the following manner. The volatile components
and added steam, which are released during
depolymerisation, are condensed and fractionated to
separate some non-aqueous contamination from this crude
mixture containing water and ε-caprolactam. This crude
water-ε-caprolactam mixture is then further purified by
adding potassium permanganate for an oxidative treatment 
in order to oxidize the impurities which are not removed
by the fractionation.The addition of potassium permanganate is
disadvantageous because solid manganese dioxide (MnO2) is
produced during the purification. This solid manganese
dioxide has to be removed by means of, for example,
filtration. The removal of manganese dioxide is
troublesome, particularly in a continuous process. A
further disadvantage is that manganese dioxide is a
valueless by-product which causes environmental pollution.In Chemiefasern/Textilindustrie 42, 497 (1992)
depolymerization of nylon-6 containing carpets has been
disclosed. Purification of the ε-caprolactam is done by
means of oxidation.The object of this invention is to provide a
method of purifying contaminated ε-caprolactam obtained
from carpet waste in which the quality of the final
product, ε-caprolactam, is at least as good as that of the
ε-caprolactam obtained by the known method described above
but which method does not result in the
