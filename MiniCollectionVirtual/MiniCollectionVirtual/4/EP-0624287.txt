<ABSTRACT>
A modem (100) includes an equalizer for equalizing a received signal (10) for amplitude jitter distortion. The received signal includes modulated symbols based on a predetermined constellation of points, each point representing a symbol. The modem first extracts a modulated symbol to provide an extracted symbol, R(k), which includes amplitude jitter distortion. The modem then identifies a signal point Pn(k) of the predetermined constellation corresponding to the extracted symbol. Further, the modem determines an error signal (76) based on the amplitude jitter distortion, and then uses the error signal to compensate subsequent extracted symbols for the amplitude jitter distortion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to communication signal receiving apparatus
including, but not limited to, apparatus for compensating the received
communication signal for at least amplitude jitter in order to retrieve modulated
digital data therefrom.Presently, data communication equipment ("DCE"), such as modems, for
example, are being using to transport digital data between data terminal
equipment ("DTE") such as personal computers, workstations and the like, over
channels such as, for instance, telephone lines. In some instances, the
communication signal is modulated to include digital data in the form of a train of
symbols based on a predetermined transmit constellation of signal points. Each
signal point of the transmit constellation represents a digital code or value.
Each symbol is modulated substantially at the signal point of the transmit
constellation corresponding to the value desired to be represented thereby in
the train, and thus transported over the channel. At the receiving DCE, the
symbols are extracted from the communication signal 
and a signal point is identified from a receive constellation of signal
points corresponding to each extracted symbol. The signal points are
used to retrieve the digital data from the modulated communication
signal.In communicating the communication signals over the telephone
network, a source of distortion thereof is known as jitter distortion and is
caused primarily by the coupling of sinusoidal distortion from 60 Hz
power lines and/or the 20 Hz ringing signal. An equalizer function is
commonly used in the receiving DCE to remove linear distortion from the
received communication signals, but because of low update gains, an
equalizer is unable to remove the jitter distortion components.Jitter distortion is comprised of phase and amplitude components.
It has been recognized that the phase jitter component of the jitter
distortion has the major effect on modem performance when using
conventional receive constellations for standard data communication
formatting between modems. Accordingly, contemporary modem
receivers include one or more phase jitter cancelling circuits for reducing
the sinusoidal components of phase jitter in the communications
channel. An example of such a phase jitter canceling circuit may be
found in the Michael D. Turner et al. U. S. Patent 4,777,640.Because of the spread in signal points of the conventional receive
constellations, the amplitude jitter component of the jitter distortion has
little effect on the modem's performance. However,
