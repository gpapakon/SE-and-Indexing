<CLAIMS>
Device for separating sheets in a pile in a business machine such 
as a facsimile machine, comprising an extraction roller (18), an 

abutment member (14) pressed elastically in the direction of the roller 
(18), and a retainer (5) limiting the maximum distance between the 

extraction roller and the abutment member, characterised by the fact 
that the retainer (5) is mounted to slide in a support member (1) in the 

direction of the abutment member, elastic means (9) being provided in 
order to push said retainer in this direction and locking means (11, 12) 

being provided in order to prevent said sliding. 
Device according to Claim 1, in which the retainer is 
substantially cylindrical and the elastic means comprise a coil spring 

(9) abuting on the one hand against the support member and on the 
other hand against a shoulder (7) of the retainer (5). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 and 2, in which the locking 
means comprise a flange (11) surrounding said retainer. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in which the abutment 
member is mounted to slide on the support member. 
Device according to Claim 4, in which the abutment member 
comprises two lateral projections (15) each engaged in a groove in the 

support member. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, in which the support 
member comprises means (2) for ratchet engagement on the frame (3) 

of said business machine. 
Method for adjusting the retainer of the device according to one 
of Claims 1 to 6, comprising the steps consisting of : 


locking the retainer (5) on the support member (1) by means of 
locking means (11, 12), in a position remote from its position of use;  

 
mounting the support member on the frame (3) of the business 
machine with the retainer opposite the abutment member (14) and the 

extraction roller (18); 
placing a wedge of calibrated thickness between the abutment 
member (14) and the extraction roller (18); 
releasing then reapplying the locking means (11, 12).
