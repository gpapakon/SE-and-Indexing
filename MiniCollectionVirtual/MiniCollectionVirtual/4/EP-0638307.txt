<CLAIMS>
Dentifrice composition, characterized in that it 
contains, in an anhydrous medium containing less than 3% 

by weight of water and comprising glycerol, at least one 
hydroxyethylcellulose containing at least one hydrophobic 

chain and at least one pyrogenic silica for which the 
mean size of the primary particles is less than 40 nm. 
Dentifrice composition according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the hydroxyethylcellulose containing 

a hydrophobic chain is chosen from hydroxyethylcelluloses 
modified by the introduction of a hydrophobic 

alkyl or aralkyl group. 
Dentifrice composition according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the hydroxyethylcelluloses have a 

molecular weight of between 1000 and 1 000 000 and have 
a mean degree of substitution with hydroxyethyl groups of 

between 2 and 4 per cellulose anhydroglucose unit of the 
cellulose molecule. 
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the degree of substitution with 

hydrophobic groups varies between 0.2% by weight with 
respect to the weight of the cellulose ether and the 

value which results in a solubility in water of the 
cellulose ether of less than 1% by weight. 
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the hydrophobic group is chosen 

from alkyl groups having 10 to 24 carbon atoms and 
aralkyl groups. 
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that use is made of hydrophilic or 

hydrophobic pyrogenic silicas for which the mean size of 
the primary particles is between 5 and 30 nm. 
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the glycerol represents more 

than 50% by weight with respect to the total weight of 
the composition. 
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that the hydroxyethylcelluloses 

containing a hydrophobic chain are used in proportions of  
 

between approximately 0.01 and 2% by weight with respect 
to the total weight of the composition. 
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 
8, characterized in that the pyrogenic silicas are used 

in proportions of between 2 and 10% by weight with 
respect to the total weight of the composition. 
Dentifrice composition according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that it also contains a 

polishing agent in proportions of between approximately 
2 and 50% by weight with respect to the total weight of 

the composition. 
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 
10, characterized in that it contains one or more foaming 

surface-active agents. 
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 
11, characterized in that it also contains active agents 

for oral hygiene. 
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 
12, characterized in that it contains at least one 

additive chosen from antibiotics, sweeteners, humectants, 
cooling agents, preservatives, dyes, fragrances, 

aromatizing or flavouring substances and agents, 
peptizing agents, plasticizers, antibacterials or 

bactericides, vitamins, agents for combating caries, 
tartar, plaque or stains, healing substances, vasomotor 

agents, agents for combating bleeding or active agents 
for the gums. 
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 
13, characterized in that it can contain enzymes and/or 

oxygen-releasing agents and/or whitening agents. 
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 
14, characterized in that it contains preservatives 

intended to retain a satisfactory bacteriological purity 
of the compositions.
