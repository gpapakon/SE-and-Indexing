<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machinability-improving
powder to be added to an iron-based powder
composition for use in powder-metallurgical manufacture
of components.Powder-metallurgical manufacture of components often
involves the following process steps. A base powder, generally
an iron or steel powder, is admixed with alloying
elements, such as nickel, copper, molybdenum and carbon,
in the form of a powder, and a lubricant. The powder mixture
is thereafter compacted in a press tool yielding what
is known as a green body of almost final geometry. After
compacting, the compact is sintered so as to obtain its
final strength, hardness, elongation etc.One of the major advantages of powder-metallurgical
manufacture of components is that it becomes possible, by
compacting and sintering, to produce blanks of final or
very close to final shape. There are however instances
where subsequent machining is required. For example, this
may be necessary because of high tolerance demands or
because the final component has such a shape that it cannot
be pressed directly but requires machining after sintering.
More specifically, geometries such as holes transverse
to the compacting direction, undercuts and threads,
call for subsequent machining.By continuously developing new sintered steels of
higher strength and thus also higher hardness, machining
has become one of the major problems in powder-metallurgical
manufacture of components. It is often a limiting
factor when assessing whether powder-metallurgical manufacture
is the most cost-effective method for manufacturing
a component. Hence, there is a great need for new and
more effective additives to improve the machinability of
sintered steels. It then is important that this additive
does not appreciably affect the mechanical properties, 
such as tensile strength and elongation, of the sintered
material.Today, there are a number of known substances which
are added to iron-based powder mixtures to facilitate the
machining of components after sintering.The commonest powder additive is MnS, which is mentioned
e.g. in EP 0 183 666, describing how the machinability
of a sintered steel is improved by the admixture
of such powder. Materials which are difficult to machine,
in this context materials having a hardness above about
180 HV, cannot however be machined properly by adding MnS.
Moreover, the addition of MnS often entails an unacceptable
reduction of the strength of the material after sintering.US 4,927,461 describes the addition of hexagonal BN
(boron nitride)
