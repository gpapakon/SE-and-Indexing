<ABSTRACT>
A connector assembly for an photoelectric sensor comprises a casing 
accommodating the photoelectric sensor, an angled sensor joint provided on the 

casing, an electric cable connecting the photoelectric sensor to an external 
circuit; and a cable connector provided at an end of said electric cable and 

detachably coupled to said sensor joint. The sensor joint is configured to have a 
rotation axis and is coupled to the casing in such a manner as to swivel about the 

rotation axis relative to the casing, thus enabling to select a suitable angular 
orientation of the sensor joint along which the cable is routed for neat wiring 

arrangement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a connector assembly for a 
photoelectric sensor, and more particularly to an assembly of connecting the 
photoelectric sensor to an electric cable leading to an external circuit. A photoelectric sensor is normally enclosed in a casing with a sensor joint 
through which an output of the sensor is connected to an electric cable leading 
to an external circuit. In a prior connector assembly for the photoelectric sensor, 
the sensor joint is fixed to the casing to have only one orientation so that the 
cable is connected to extend from the case only along one direction. When the 
sensor casing is required to be installed in a limited space, such fixed orientation 
of the sensor joint may sometimes a conflict with the limited space requirement. 
In order to avoid the problem, it is required to provide different sensor casings 
with the sensor joint of differing orientations so that an user can select one of the 
sensor casing having the sensor joint of desired orientation for an intended 
installation site. The above problem has been eliminated in a connector assembly for a 
photoelectric sensor. The connector assembly of the present invention comprises 
a casing accommodating the photoelectric sensor, an angled sensor joint 
supported to the casing, an electric cable for connecting the photoelectric sensor to 
an external circuit; and a cable connector provided at an end of the electric cable 
and detachably coupled to the sensor joint. The sensor joint is characterized to 
have a rotation axis perpendicular to the direction of extension of the cable and be capable of swiveling about the rotation axis relative to 
the casing. Thus, the cable can be routed from the casing in any direction so that  
 
the sensor casing can be installed neatly together with the cable within a limited 
space. Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a 
connector assembly which is capable of varying the routing direction of the cable 
depending upon a space requirement in the installation site. The connector assembly further includes a latch structure for holding the 
sensor joint at a suitable angular orientation relative to the casing in order to 
avoid unintentional position change of the sensor joint, i.e., the routing direction 
of the cable. The latch structure is formed by parts belonging to the casing and 
the sensor joint so that the latching of the sensor joint can be realized without 
using any separate additional member. In a preferred embodiment,
