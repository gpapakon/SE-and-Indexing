<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to soil sterilisation.Much otherwise highly fertile soil is badly
contaminated with pests which include, but are not
restricted to, nematodes i.e. eel worm, and seeds.Hitherto it has generally been necessary to either
accept the sometimes major reduction in yield or to apply
chemical pesticides. In view of the concerns expressed
about the environmental and human effects of pesticides
there is a considerable need for a non-chemical method of
destroying soil-borne pests.It has been known from old to sterilise mushroom
beds by passing steam through perforated pipes in the
beds. This method is not suitable for use in fields
because of the cost of laying the pipes. Additionally
the control of temperature is very difficult. Parts of
the bed will probably be heated too much and the soil
structures damaged and the microbiological populations
distorted too greatly. Conversely other parts are likely
to be insufficiently heated and thus not freed of
infestation.WO94/01723 published 20 January 1994 describes a
straw burner. Straw is harvested chopped and passed to a
burner. Combustion gases exiting the device may impinge
on the ground. These gases may ignite dry plant material 
on the surface and possibly over-heat the top-most part of the soil. It is
unlikely that any effect will be present lower down.US 144 794 describes soil treating apparatus comprising a lift for
raising soil from the ground.
means for transferring the raised soil into a rotatable heating drum

raising soil from the ground, means for transferring the raised soil into a
rotatable drum, a heater for heating the soil in the drum to about 70°C and
means for discharging the heated soil.According to the invention there is provided apparatus for destroying
soil borne pest comprising:
1. a lift for raising at least the top 100 mm of soil;2. means for transferring the raised soil into a rotatable heating drum;3. a helical baffle and laterally extending trip plate received in the drum;4. a heater for heating soil received in the drum to a temperature in
the range 50 to 85°C; and5. a discharger for discharging the treated soil.According to the invention there is further provided a method of
destroying soil borne pests comprising the steps of:
1. lifting at least the top 100 mm of soil containing pests to be
destroyed from the ground;2. transferring the

Apparatus for destroying soil borne pests comprising:

i. a lift (5,6,7,8) for raising soil from the ground;
ii. means for transferring the raised soil into a rotatable heating drum
(10);
iii. a helical baffle (70) received in the drum (10);
iv. a heater (65) for heating soil received in the drum (10); and
v. a discharger for discharging the heated soil onto the ground

characterised in that

the lift is capable of lifting at least the top 100 mm of soil.
in that laterally extending trip plates (75) are provided at intervals inside
the drum (10) and
in that the soil is heated to a temperature in the range 50 to 85°C.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein the lift comprises a plurality of
cleats (5) carried on endless belts (6).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein a depth control (60)
for controlling the depth of soil lifted is provided.
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein a clod
breaker for breaking at least 70 wt% of the soil into lumps having a major axis

of less than 75 mm prior to heating is provided. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein a
separator for separating stones from soil discharged from the heater is

provided.
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein a
second heating drum is provided coaxial with and surrounding the first drum.
A method of destroying soil borne pests comprising:

a) lifting soil containing pests to be destroyed from the ground;
b) transferring the lifted soil into a rotating heating drum (10) having
a helical baffle (70);
c) heating the soil in the drum (10) to destroy the pest;
d) discharging the heated soil onto the ground;

characterised in that

at least the top 100 mm of soil is lifted,
laterally extending trip plates (75) are provided at intervals inside the

drum and
that the soil is heated to a temperature in the range 50 to 85°C.
A method as claimed in claim 7 wherein at least 70 wt% of the soil is
broken into lumps having a major axis of less than 75 mm prior to heating.
A method as claimed in claim 7 or claim 8 wherein stones are separated
from soil discharged from the heater.
