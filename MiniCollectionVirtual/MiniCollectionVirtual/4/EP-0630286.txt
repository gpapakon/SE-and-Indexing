<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns oil-in-water type
emulsions useful as a delivery vehicle of hydrophobic active
ingredients such as pharmaceutical drugs or cosmetically
active agents. The emulsions of the present invention are
characterized in that their colloid particles are positively
charged.In recent years, oil-in-water type emulsions, in
particularly such in which the droplets are of a submicron
size (hereinafter "submicron emulsions") gained increasing
importance as vehicles for delivery of hydrophobic drugs.
Formulations of submicron emulsions reported in the
literature to date were usually based on a combination of
lecithins which are mixtures of phospholipids of various
compositions obtained from natural sources, non-ionic or
ionic surfactants and of oil such as vegetable oil.
Lecithins generally comprise phosphatidylcholine as the major
component, which is a zwitterion that is neutral over a wide
pH range, and negatively charged phospholipids such as
phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic
acid. As a consequence of their composition, the colloid
particles in all emulsions available to date were negatively
charged.In order to increase stability of emulsions it was 
generally accepted that the charge of the colloid particles,
or the so called "zeta potential", should be made as negative
as possible, e.g. by the addition of various non-ionic or
also negatively charged surfactants. However, negatively
charged particles have a tendency of absorption of cations
such as sodium and calcium ions which are present in all
physiological fluids. Such absorption decreases the net
surface charge of the particles and may eventually cause the
breakdown of the droplets and the coalesence of small
droplets to form larger ones. For the long term stability of
such emulsions it was always necessary to prepare them with
deionized water. A further problem of such emulsions resides
in that the surface of biological membranes is generally
negatively charged and there is thus an electrostatic
repulsion between such membranes and the negatively charged
colloid particles of the emulsion. This is at times a
serious drawback for various applications.Thus, against the very high potential of emulsions,
and in particularly submicron emulsions, as drug delivery of
vehicles, there are the above noted drawbacks.European Patent Application 372331 discloses oil-in-water
type emulsions, for parenteral administration which
contain phospholipids as emulsifiers and being characterized
in that they comprise
