<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to methods and
apparatus for conducting analyses. More particularly,
the invention relates to the design and construction of
small, typically single-use, modules capable of rapidly
determining the presence of an analyte in a fluid
sample.In recent decades the art has developed a very
large number of protocols, test kits, and cartridges
for conducting analyses on biological samples for
various diagnostic and monitoring purposes.
Immunoassays, agglutination assays, and analyses based
on polymerase chain reaction, various ligand-receptor
interactions, and differential migration of species in
a complex sample all have been used to determine the 
presence or concentration of various biological
compounds or contaminants, or the presence of
particular cell types.Recently, small, disposable devices have been
developed for handling biological samples and for
conducting certain clinical tests. Shoji et al.
reported the use of a miniature blood gas analyser
fabricated on a silicon wafer. Shoji et al., Sensors
and Actuators, 15:101-107 (1988). Sato et al. reported
a cell fusion technique using micromechanical silicon
devices. Sato et al., Sensors and Actuators,
A21-A23:948-953 (1990). Ciba Corning Diagnostics Corp.
(USA) has manufactured a microprocessor-controlled
laser photometer for detecting blood clotting.Micromachining technology originated in the
microelectronics industry. Angell et al., Scientific
American, 248:44-55 (1983). Micromachining technology
has enabled the manufacture of microengineered devices
having structural elements with minimal dimensions
ranging from tens of micrometers (the dimensions of
biological cells) to nanometers (the dimensions of some
biological macromolecules). This scale is referred to
herein as "mesoscale". Most experiments involving
mesoscale structures have involved studies of
micromechanics, i.e., mechanical motion and flow
properties. The potential capability of mesoscale
structures has not been exploited fully in the life
sciences.Brunette (Exper. Cell Res., 167:203-217 (1986) and
164:11-26 (1986)) studied the behavior of fibroblasts
and epithelial cells in grooves in silicon, titanium-coated 
polymers and the like. McCartney et al. (Cancer
Res., 41:3046-3051 (1981)) examined the behavior of
tumor cells in grooved plastic substrates. LaCelle
(Blood Cells, 12:179-189 (1986)) studied leukocyte and
erythrocyte flow in microcapillaries to gain insight
into microcirculation. Hung and Weissman reported a
study of fluid dynamics in micromachined
