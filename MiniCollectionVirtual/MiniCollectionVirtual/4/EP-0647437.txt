<ABSTRACT>
A clamping device for clamping a rodlike member to 
a housing, particularly a dental tool to a handpiece, 

includes a tapered sleeve and a tapered collet received 
within the tapered sleeve, both having open ends for 

receiving the rodlike member, and inner diameters which 
decrease from their open ends to their opposite ends. The 

tapered collet is formed with an axial slit starting from 
its open end and extending along a part of its length 

towards its closed end, permitting the collet to contract in 
diameter in order to firmly clamp the rodlike member. A 

depressable button is engageable with the closed end of the 
tapered collet to move the collet outwardly of the tapered 

sleeve, thereby to expand the tapered collet and to permit 
removal or insertion of the rodlike member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to clamping devices 
for clamping a rodlike member to a housing. The invention 
is particularly useful in dental handpieces for clamping the 
shaft of a dental tool, such as a bur or drill, to the 
handpiece, and the invention is therefore described below 
with respect to this application. One form of dental handpiece to which the 
invention is especially suitable is an air turbine handpiece 
for driving a dental tool, such as a bur or drill, at 
extemely high speeds, e.g. of the order of 400,000 rpm. In 
the existing air turbine handpieces, the clamping devices 
for clamping the dental tool shaft are generally of 
relatively bulky construction which increases the size and 
weight of the handpiece, and/or requires relatively awkward 
manipulations in order to remove and insert the dental tool 
into the handpiece. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
clamping device for clamping a rodlike member to a housing, 
which clamping may be embodied in a relatively simple, 
lightweight construction that can be conveniently 
manipulated in order to remove and insert the rodlike 
member. A more particular object of the present invention 
is to provide a dental handpiece including a clamping device 
having the above advantages for clamping a dental tool 
thereto. According to one aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided a clamping device for clamping a rodlike 
member to a housing, comprising a tapered sleeve carried by 
the housing and having an inner diameter which increases 
from an open end thereof to its opposite end; a tapered 
collet received within the open end of the tapered sleeve; 
the tapered collet having an open end for receiving the 
rodlike member, and an inner diameter which decreases from 
its open end to its opposite end; the tapered collet being 
formed with an axial slit starting from its open end and 
extending along at least a part of its length, permitting  
 
the part to contract in diameter in order to firmly clamp 
the rodlike member when received in the tapered collet and 
the tapered collet is received within the tapered sleeve; a 
depressable button carried by the housing and having an 
inner surface engageable with the opposite end of the 
tapered collet, and an outer surface engageable by a user to 
depress the button; and a spring normally urging said button 
outwardly of the housing but being depressable to move the 
tapered collet outwardly of the tapered sleeve, thereby to 
expand the part of the tapered collet to permit

A clamping device for clamping a rodlike 
member to a housing, comprising: 

   a tapered sleeve carried by said housing and 
having an inner diameter which increases from an open end 

thereof to its opposite end; 
   a tapered collet received within said open end of 

the tapered sleeve; said tapered collet having an open end 
for receiving the rodlike member, and an inner diameter 

which decreases from its open end to its opposite end; said 
tapered collet being formed with an axial slit starting from 

its open end and extending along at least a part of its 
length, permitting said part to contract in diameter in 

order to firmly clamp the rodlike member when received in 
the tapered collet and the tapered collet is received within 

the tapered sleeve; 
   a depressable button carried by said housing and 

having an inner surface engageable with said opposite end of 
the tapered collet, and an outer surface engageable by a 

user to depress the button; 
   and a spring normally urging said button outwardly 

of the housing but being depressable to move the tapered 
collet outwardly of the tapered sleeve, thereby to expand 

said part of the tapered collet to permit removal of the 
rodlike member from the tapered collet or insertion of the 

rodlike member into the tapered collet. 
The clamping device according to Claim 1, 
wherein said tapered collet is formed with a plurality of 

said axial slits equally spaced around the circumference of 
the tapered collet. 
The clamping device according to Claim 2, 
wherein said plurality of axial slits terminate short of 

said opposite end of the tapered collet. 
The clamping device according to any one of 
Claims 1-3, wherein said opposite end of the tapered collet 

is closed by an end wall formed with an enlarged head 
engageable by said inner surface of the depressable button. 
The clamping device according to any one of 
Claims 1-4, wherein said depressable button is received 

within an opening formed in a collar fixed to said housing, 
and said spring is an annular spring which urges the 

depressable button against the inner surface of the collar 
around said opening. 
The clamping device according to any one of 
Claims 1-5, wherein said tapered sleeve is carried by a 

rotary drive member. 
The clamping device according to Claim 6, 
wherein said rotary drive member is an air turbine having a 

plurality of blades for rotating said tapered collet and 
said rodlike member when clamped therein. 
The clamping device according to Claim 7, 
wherein said tapered sleeve is integrally formed with said 

air turbine. 
The clamping device according to any one of 
Claims 6-8, wherein said housing includes a bearing 

rotatably mounting said rotary drive member, tapered sleeve, 
tapered collar and rodlike member when clamped therein, with 

respect to said housing; said bearing including a static 
section and a rotatable section; said clamping device 

further including a resilient, vibration-absorbing O-ring 
interposed between the housing and the static section of the 

bearing. 
The clamping device according to any one of 
Claims 6-9, wherein said housing is a dental handpiece for 

receiving the rodlike shaft of a dental tool.
