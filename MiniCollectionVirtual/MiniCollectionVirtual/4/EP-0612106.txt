<ABSTRACT>
Reduced soft errors in charge-sensitive circuit elements such as 
volatile memory cells 200 occur by using boron-11 to the exclusion of boron-10 

or essentially free of boron-10 in borosilicate glass 230, 240 deposited on 
the substrate 206 directly over the arrays of memory cells. Boron-10 exhibits 

a high likelihood of fission to release a 1.47 MeV alpha particle upon capture 
of a naturally occurring cosmic ray neutron. This capture occurs frequently 

in boron-10 because of its high neutron capture cross-section. Boron-11 does 
not fission.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to semiconductor devices 
that include circuit elements sensitive to alpha particles, 
and particularly relates to electronic devices, such as 
dynamic random access memories, DRAMs, charge-coupled 
devices, CCDs, and possibly static random access memories, 
SRAMs, that include charge-sensitive elements whose 
performance might be compromised by the presence of alpha 
particles. Alpha particle induced errors in DRAMs have been observed 
and addressed for some time. A paper by Webb, C., et al., 
"A 65ns CMOS 1Mb DRAM", ISSCC 1986, pp. 262-263, discloses a 
planar one transistor cell design placing the array of 
memory cells in an N-well to obtain a soft error rate (SER) 
of less than 1000FITs without a die coat. A paper by Shah, 
A.H., et al., "A 4Mb DRAM with Cross-point Trench Transistor 
Cell", ISSCC 1986, pp. 268-269 discloses obtaining improved 
soft error rate over conventional 1-T cells with the stored 
charge oxide-isolated from the substrate. A paper by Takada,  
 
M., et al., "A 4Mb DRAM with Half Internal-Voltage Bitline 
Precharge", ISSCC 1986, pp. 270-271 discloses a trench cell 
having high immunity against alpha-particle soft errors with 
a buried polysilicon electrode storing the signal charge, 
while a heavily doped substrate of a P/P++ epitaxial wafer 
serves as the counter electrode. Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 10, no. 24 (E-0377); 
JP-A-60183768, proposes the use of boron 11 as an impurity 
for producing a P-type substrate to reduce the deterioration 
of electrical characteristics due to the decrease in 
impurity concentration on irradiation. A similar proposal is 
made in Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 14, no. 338 (E-0954); 
JP-A-2114665, which suggests the use of a mixture of boron 10 
and boron 11 as the impurity for forming a P-type base 
region. EP-A-0497541 discloses the use of 
borophosphosilicate glass as an insulating layer in a 
semiconductor device.  
 Under the ever present cosmic ray neutron flux, boron-10, a naturally 
occuring (∼19.9% by weight) isotope of boron, fissions, producing lithium-7 
and a 1.47 MeV alpha particle (10B(n,α)7Li). Because of the high neutron 
capture cross section of boron-10, this reaction is a significant source of alpha 
particles. We have discovered that boron-10 used in boron-doped glass 
materials proximate the charge-sensitive circuit elements is the major source 
of alpha particles causing the soft error rate. Semiconductor devices and particularly those semiconductor devices 
that include
