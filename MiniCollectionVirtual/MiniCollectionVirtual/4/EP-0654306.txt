<ABSTRACT>
There are provided an apparatus for and a method of forming a coating film of photosensitive resin on a 
large-sized glass substrate for LCD color filters such that the coating film is not affected by unevenness of a main 

surface of the substrate. A substrate (S) is sucked and held by a movable holder (8) with its coated main surface 
directed downward. Provided below the substrate (S) is an application head (H) having a straight slit (13), throug
h 
which a coating liquid is discharged upward. When the substrate (S) is relatively moved obliquely upward with a 

particular clearance (I₂) between it and the coating head (H), a coating liquid bead (B) is formed between the slit 
(13) and the substrate (S) and is moved obliquely downward along the substrate (S) to form a coating film (R
d
). A 
meniscus (L₂) of the coating liquid bead (B) facing a higher side of the substrate (S) has a greater height (h₂) than 

that of a meniscus (L₁) facing a lower side of the substrate such that the height of the meniscus facing the higher side 
of the substrate (S) is substantially greater than the thickness of a liquid coating film.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus
for applying an application liquid to sheet-like separate
substrates such as large glass substrates typified by color
filters for an LCD.A spin coating method is often used in the prior art
as a method of coating an application liquid over sheet-like
separate substrates such as large glass substrates
typified by color filters for an LCD. Among spin coating
methods, there is a method open to the atmosphere and a
sealed cup method, but each of these methods has a low
application efficiency of approximately 10% and moreover
they have a disadvantage that the applied layer at corner
portions of the substrate is too thick, and it has been
pointed out that there will be problems concerning factors
such as the amount of application liquid used, the layer
thickness distribution, and the throughput as substrate
sizes are expected to get larger in the future.A knife coating method, a roll coating method, and a
die coating method are available as methods capable of
solving the above faults of the spin coating method. Each
of these methods provides a clearance (gap) for application
above the substrate on which the liquid is to be applied,
the value thereof determines the application layer
thickness, and smoothness is obtained for the application
surface, but if the smoothness (degree of unevenness) of
the substrate surface has a value greater than the accuracy
of the application, it is difficult to achieve a uniform
layer thickness by using any of these methods.A dip coating method is generally known as an
application method that is hardly affected by unevenness
of the substrate surface, but it is difficult to avoid
coating the non-application portions thereof and
selectively coat only the main surface of the substrate 
with this method. A liquid application method is known as
a method with application principles that resemble those
of the dip coating method and which also selectively coats
only the main surface, as stated on page 336 of "Latest
Advances in Coating Techniques," edited by Mr. Yuji
Harasaki and published by Kabushiki Kaisha Sogo Gijyutu
Center, Japan on April 30, 1988. With this method,
application liquid is supplied in substantially the
horizontal direction through a die head or slide coating
die, as will be described below. Liquid adjacent to a lip
on the side surface of the die head or sliding die is moved
in a direction perpendicular to the substrate that is to
be coated. The application liquid supplied from the die
head or sliding die forms
