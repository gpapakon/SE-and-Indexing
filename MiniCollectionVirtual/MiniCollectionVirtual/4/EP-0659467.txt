<ABSTRACT>
Process for the manufacture of alkali metal hydroxide, according to which an electrodialysis cell containing three compartments is used, an aqueous solution of alkali metal halide is circulated in a saline compartment of the cell, bounded between an anionic membrane and a cationic membrane, an alkali metal halide is introduced into an acidic compartment of the cell, bounded between the anionic membrane and a cationic face of a bipolar membrane and an aqueous solution of alkali metal hydroxide is extracted from an alkaline compartment of the cell, bounded between the cationic membrane and an anionic face of the bipolar membrane.

Process for the manufacture of an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution
containing from 3 to 10 moles of alkali metal hydroxide per litre, according to which

an electrodialysis cell containing three compartments is used, an aqueous alkali metal
halide solution is circulated in a saline compartment of the cell, delimited between an

anionic membrane and a cationic membrane, an alkali metal halide is introduced into
an acidic compartment of the cell, which is delimited between the anionic membrane

and a cationic face of the bipolar membrane, and the aqueous alkali metal hydroxide
solution is extracted from an alkaline compartment of the cell, delimited between the

cationic membrane and an anionic face of a bipolar membrane, characterized in that
the introduction of the alkali metal halide into the acidic compartment is adjusted in

order to obtain in the latter an aqueous hydrohalic acid solution containing from 0.5 to
2 moles of alkali metal halide per litre.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that the aqueous alkali
metal halide solution of the saline compartment is substantially saturated with

alkali metal halide.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the alkali metal
halide is introduced into the acidic compartment in the state of an aqueous

solution.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the
alkali metal halide which is introduced into the acidic compartment is identical to

the alkali metal halide of the solution introduced into the saline compartment.
Process according to any one of Claims 3 to 4, characterized in that the
aqueous alkali metal halide solution which is introduced into the acidic

compartment comprises at least a fraction of a dilute aqueous alkali metal halide
solution which is withdrawn from the saline compartment.
Process according to any one of Claims 3 to 5, characterized in that the
aqueous alkali metal halide solution which is introduced into the acidic

compartment comprises seawater.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the
aqueous alkali metal halide solution which is introduced into the saline 

compartment is an aqueous sodium chloride solution, and in that the alkali metal
halide which is introduced into the acidic compartment comprises sodium

chloride.
