<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a charge transfer device. Such devices include at least one insulated conductive grid (3) connecting two semiconductor areas. According to the invention, each insulated conductive grid (3) has a width which gradually increases from the first semiconductor area (1) to the second semiconductor area (2). The width of each grid (3) is sufficiently narrow for the potential trough created by applying a voltage (V) to the grid to have a gradually increasing depth from the first area (1) to the second area (2), thus driving the charges. The invention can be applied to any charge transfer device and particularly to photodiodes.

Photodiode consisting of a photosensitive zone
(1) enabling charges to be generated under the effect

of light and of a storage gate (2) intended to store
the charges thus generated, characterized in that the

photosensitive zone (1) comprises means (3) for
draining towards the storage gate (2) the charges

generated far from this gate, these means consisting of
at least one drainage gate (3) located in the

photosensitive zone and electrically connected to the
storage gate (2), each drainage gate (3) having a width

increasing progressively towards the storage gate (2),
the said width being sufficiently narrow for a

potential well to be created beneath the said gate (3),
the depth of the potential well increasing on moving

closer to the storage gate (2).
Photodiode according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the photodiode includes a p
+
-doped semiconductor
layer located on an n-doped semiconductor layer which

is itself located on a p-doped semiconductor layer, in
that each drainage gate (3) consists of a

polycrystalline silicon layer (8) deposited on an
insulation layer (9) and in that the photosensitive

zone located beneath the said drainage gate does not
have a p
+
 layer.
Photodiode according to either of Claims 1 and
2, characterized in that the n-doped layer of the

photosensitive zone (1) is in the form of a set of
channels (11) perpendicular to the drainage gates (3) 

and widening progressively on the side turned towards a
drainage gate.
Photodiode according to any one of Claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the storage gate adjoins the

periphery of the photodiode over only part of the
latter and in that an insulating zone (4) is provided

around the photodiode over the rest of the said
periphery.
