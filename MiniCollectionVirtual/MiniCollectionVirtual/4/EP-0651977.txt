<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to dental vacuum systems for
servicing dental operatory in the removal of solid matter, washings, and
other waste mixtures resulting from dental procedures.Conventional dental vacuum systems require periodic, and
frequently expensive, upkeep. Such upkeep may involve replacement and
maintenance of motors required to produce the requisite vacuum for the
dental operatories being serviced. Conventional wet system dental
vacuums normally use a single large, powerful motor, or two such large
motors mounted in parallel arrangements. When large motors of a turbine
type are used, e.g., in parallel arrangements, such arrangements are
normally for use in large dental offices and are quite expensive due
primarily to the cost of such motors. In contrast, so-called dry systems
typically generate vacuum with high speed vane type fans, and their
operating motors are smaller and usually much noisier and shorter lived
than conventional water sealed impeller type pumps used in wet systems.
An air series arrangement in such dry systems, while known, is not widely
adopted because an air exhaust from a first unit, e.g., serving to supply
inlet air to a second unit causes that second unit to quickly heat up. This
heat frequently results in premature motor failure within an unacceptably
short period of time, particularly with small, inexpensive motors used for
power operation of vacuum creating blowers.A primary object of this invention is to provide a new and
improved dry vacuum apparatus for a dental operatory and which is
particularly designed to use relatively small, inexpensive vacuum motor
fan units in a uniquely compact, aligned configuration with a collection
tank.Another object of this invention is to provide a new and
improved dry vacuum apparatus of the type described wherein relatively
small, inexpensive vacuum motor fan units are mounted in air series
relation and provided with a simplified air cooling system for reliable, long
term service under demanding conditions with minimized maintenance
requirements. Yet another object of this invention is to provide a new and
improved dry vacuum apparatus of the type described which incorporates
a flexible mounting coupling particularly suited to secure a pair of such
vacuum motor fan units in aligned, stacked relation while additionally
providing a common sealed plenum chamber for supplying cooling air to
the motor inlets and a mechanically shock-free suspension without
requiring conventional and typically high cost customized cabinetry.A
