<ABSTRACT>
The swivel basket bracket and stand has been designed to: 1) allow easy loading of flowering plants into basket. This is achieved by having no horizontal bars on the basket, therefore allowing that potted plants once removed from their plant pots can easily slid down into the basket between the vertical arms (1) of the basket; 2) the easy loading stand function is threefold (A) it overcomes the problem, when loading a flower basket on a flat surface the overhanging blooms can get damaged, (B) because the basket swivels on the stand the need to move around the basket is removed when loading with plants, it is simply swivelled to whichever area of the basket you are working on, (C) it can also be used as jardiniere; 3) when the basket is filled to satisfaction it can be removed from the easy loading stand, it can then be placed on the bracket to be swivelled, so that all areas of the basket may get its equal share of sunlight. The relationship between all three items can be seen in the figure.

<DESCRIPTION>
 S IVEL BASKET, BRACKET AND EASY LOADING STANDThis invention relates to a swivel flower basket, bracket and easy loading stand.Traditionally flower/hanging baskets have been constructed to design whereby vertical wires cross over horizontal wires leaving gaps between the wires for plants to grow through. They are hung by chains from a standard gallows bracket.Some of the problems experienced with the traditional hanging baskets are : .When loading the basket the spaces left between the vertical and horizontal wires are insufficient to allow the root of the plant to be pushed through and damage to a blooming plants results, when trying to get blooms through these spaces. The chains have a limited life span, and in adverse weather conditions allows the basket to swing, thus the chains entangl themselves with the bloom causing .damage to the plants or removing the bloom altogether. Because hanging baskets are usually hung from a wall mounted bracket the plants at the bac of the basket (closest to the wall) do not get direct sunlight, these plants are likely to wither which is a cost penalty to the purchaser, not to mention a disappointing resul with your flower basket.Having considered the drawbacks with the conventional hanging basket, the following features have been incorporated in the new invention :1. There are no horizontal wires/bars thus allowing a bloomin plant to be slid down between the vertical arms of the basket.2. The bracket is designed to support the basket from beneath thus removing the need for chains. ,3. The bracket arm has a top mounted spigot and the bottom of the basket has a receptor for the spigot to enter with sufficient clearance to allow the basket to be swivelled, allowing all plants to receive an equal exposure to the sunlight once swivelled.4. The easy loading stand/jardiniere also has a top mounted spigot like the bracket, thereby allowing the basket to be removed from the stand and placed on a spigot on the wall/bracket.5. (Because the bracket is of a rigid construction the basket will not swing in adverse weather conditions.I 

 The specific embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which :Drawing 1 : Shows a cross section of the basket with spigot receptor (refered to as a stabiliser cap and washer) .Drawing 2 : Shows bracket with top mounted spigot.Drawing 3 : Shows easy loading stand/jardiniere with tbp mounted spigot.Drawing 4 : Shows the basket, the bracket and the stand and demonstrates the

CLAIMS
1. The swivel basket, bracket and easy loading stand comprises of flower basket which because of its design allows plants to be slid into position between vertical arms.
2. An easy loading stand with a top mounted spigot which allows the basket to be swivled on it. thus making loading of plants in to the basket easier.
3. A support bracket with a top mounted spigot which .allows the basket to be swivled on it, so that all the areas of the basket can receive there fair share of sunlight.
4. As the basket is supported from beneath by the bracket a unique design for the bracket which does not allow overhanging plants to snag on the bracket has been incorporated.
5. Because the spigot on the stand, as in claim two and the spigot on the bracket as in claim three are dimensionally the same, the basket can be removed from the stand and placed on the bracket.
6. The swivel basket, bracket and easy loading stand as described herein with reference to drawings 1 - 4 of the accompanying drawings.
