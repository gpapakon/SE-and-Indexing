<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device having a structure of high-density connection the pitch of which is less than 150 µm. 
The connection electrodes are free from shortcircuit due to conductive adhesive and solder. The connection can be 

achieved at a high yield. The semiconductor device comprises a substrate having a plurality of connecting electrodes 
(17); a semiconductor chip having projecting electrodes (15); a conductive adhesive (18) for bonding the connecting 

electrodes and projecting electrodes; and a flow preventing member (22) arranged between the connecting electrodes 
on the substrate in order to prevent shortcircuit between the connecting electrodes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, comprising a substrate
having an electrode, a semiconductor device having a projecting electrode, a conductive
adhesive for connecting said electrode and said projecting electrode and a
flow preventing member which is conductive as a whole.For mounting of a semiconductor chip of liquid crystal display apparatus it is known
to use an upper layer made of metal or insulating material (Patents Abstracts of
Japan, vol. 16, no. 221 (E 1205), 22 May 1992 & JP 04 037146 A). This upper layer
has at its one side a ring-shaped end which is formed as a flow preventing member on
a transparent electrode. In an opening of the ring-shaped end of the upper layer a
conductive adhesive of a light-setting type is poured. Thereafter, a bump electrode is
put down on the adhesive, and the light is radiated to the adhesive so as to connect
therethrough the bump electrode with the connection electrode in the ring-shaped end
of the upper layer. The flow preventing member may consist of a different material to
that of the connection electrode.As a means for mounting a semiconductor device in a liquid crystal display unit, a
so-called chip-on-glass (to be referred to as COG hereinafter) method in which a
semiconductor device is mounted in a substrate consisting of glass will be described
with reference to Figs. 4 and 5. Fig. 4 is a sectional view showing a projecting
electrode provided to a semiconductor device. Fig. 5 is a sectional view showing a
mounting structure in which the semiconductor device and a substrate are connected
to each other by using the COG method.As shown in Fig. 4, a protective film 13 is formed such that a connection pad 12
formed on the element formation surface of a semiconductor device 11 and consisting
of aluminum is exposed. A common electrode film 
14 is formed on the connection pad 12 to prevent adhesion to
the connection pad 12 or diffusion. A projecting electrode
15 is formed using a metal such as copper or gold (Au) by a
plating method or a vacuum evaporation method. The
projecting electrode 15 is also formed on a semiconductor
element formation region to improve the mounting density.A method of connecting the semiconductor device 11
having the projecting electrode 15 formed thereon to a
connection electrode 17 arranged on a substrate 16 will be
described below with reference to Fig. 5.As shown in Fig. 5, a conductive adhesive 18
obtained by mixing conductive particles 19 in an epoxy
adhesive is coated at the distal end portion of the
projecti
