<ABSTRACT>
The drill head for the medullary canal is intended to open the medullary canal of a tubular bone for osteosynthetic nailing of fractured tubular bones. It possesses a front member (1), a central member (2), a rear member (3) and a coupling member (4) connected to the rear member for the releasable fastening on a driveable, flexible drill shaft. The drill head for the medullary canal is designed as a hollow rotational body and in its front member (1) and in its rear member (3) it has three openings (5) each in the form of slots cut spirally in the surface (6) of the hollow rotational body.

Drill head for drilling out the medulla of a tubular bone with a front part (1), a middle
part (2), a rear part (3) and connected to the rear part coupling means (4) for a

loosenable attachment to a drill shaft which is apt to be driven,

characterized in that

the drill head is formed as a hollow body of revolution and in that it is provided at least
at the front part (1) and 
at the rear part (3) with one or more openings (5) in the lateral
area (6) of the hollow body of revolution.
Drill head according to claim 1, characterized in that the front part (1) and preferably
the rear part (3) as well have the shape of a hollow truncated cone.
Drill head according to claim 1 or 2, cnaracterized in that the openings (5) are
realized in the form of slots arranged spirally in the lateral area (6) and whose edges

(10) facing the coupling means (4) are preferably shaped as cutting edges.
Drill head according to claim 3, characterized in that in the front part (1) as well as in
the adjacent section of the middle part (2) two slots about 180° apart and also in the

rear part (3) as well as in the adjacent section of the middle part (2) two slots about
180° apart are arranged.
Drill head according to claim 3, characterized in that in the front part (1) as well as in
the adjacent section of the middle part (2) three slots about 120° apart and also in the

rear part (3) as well as in the adjacent section of the middle part (2) three slots about
120° apart are arranged.
Drill head according to one of the claims 3 to 5, characterized in that the spiral slots
are provided with an angle of inclination of 20° to 40°, preferably of 25° to 35°. 
Drill head according to one of the claims 3 to 6, characterized in that the spiral slots
extend over a radial azimuth angle of 60° to 120°, preferably of 80° to 100°.
Drill head according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the thickness of
the shell amounts between 0,5 and 2 mm, preferably between 0,8 and 1,2 mm.
Drill head according to one of the claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the front part (1)
and the coupling means (4) are both provided with an outlet opening (7;8) where

through a drilling thom may be guided in the axial direction.
Drill head according to one of the claims 1 to 9, characterized in that at least 50%,
preferably at least 70% of its total volume is hollow.
