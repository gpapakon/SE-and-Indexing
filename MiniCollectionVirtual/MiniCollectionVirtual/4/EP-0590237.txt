<ABSTRACT>
A seat assembly (10) is disclosed having a passenger 
restraint system (20) integrally incorporated therein. The seat 

assembly (10) is a "load-carrying" unit that is constructed 
to transfer the loading imparted on the passenger restraint 

system (20) to the vehicle's reinforced floor structure (18) 
during the occurrence of a "loaded" condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to automotive seating and, more 
particularly, to a modular seat assembly having a safety belt restraint system incorporated 
therein. Virtually all motor vehicles are equipped with some type of passenger restraint 
system for physically restraining the seat occupant when the vehicle is subjected to high rates 
of deceleration which may occur, for example, during heavy braking or a collision (i.e., 
"loaded" conditions). The most common type of passenger restraint system is a safety belt 
system having a lap belt and a shoulder belt, or a combination thereof, that can be withdrawn 
from a retractor mechanism for latched engagement with an anchored buckle member. The 
retractor mechanism is operable to inhibit withdrawal of the safety belt upon the vehicle being 
subjected to deceleration forces exceeding a predetermined level, thereby restraining the 
vehicle occupant within the seat assembly. In most safety belt systems, the retractor mechanism is anchored to a 
reinforced vertical pillar (i.e., the B-Pillar) of the motor vehicle while the lap belt and buckle 
member are typically anchored on opposite lateral sides of the seat assembly to a reinforced 
floor structure. Thus, such safety belt restraint systems have an anchorage arrangement 
wherein loading is directed to three distinct load points on the vehicle's structure. In other 
safety belt systems, it is known to anchor the buckle member for translational movement with 
the seat assembly during fore and aft positional adjustment. However, due to the increased 
loading imposed on the buckle member, the seat adjustment mechanism must be structurally 
reinforced to comply with the increased load carrying requirements. Moreover, such 
"travelling" buckle arrangements still require that the retractor mechanism be anchored to a  
 
vertical pillar of the motor vehicle. Thus, the need exists to develop a seat assembly 
incorporating an integrally mounted safety belt restraint system, wherein the seat assembly 
is a load-carrying unit that can be mounted directly to a reinforced floor structure of the motor 
vehicle. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a significant 
improvement in seating systems for motor vehicle applications. More particularly, the present 
invention is directed to a seat assembly having a passenger restraint system integrally 
incorporated therein. The seat assembly is a "load-carrying" unit that is constructed to 
transfer the loading imparted on the passenger

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle seat having a seat bottom frame (56;158), 
a seat back frame (66; 122; 160), a hinge mechanism for connecting 

said seat back frame (66; 122; 160) to said seat bottom 
frame (56; 158), a track mechanism (16; 156) connecting said 

seat bottom frame (56; 158) to the floor of the vehicle, and 
a seat belt system (20) comprising a seat belt (24) adapted 

to be positioned over the lap of the occupant and over the 
shoulder and across the upper torso of the occupant and anchored 

at one end to one lateral side of said seat bottom frame (56; 
158) or said track mechanism (16; 156), a retractor assembly 

(32) for anchoring and storing at least a portion of a second 
end of the seat belt (24), and latch means including a buckle 

(22) and a latch plate (30) adapted for releasable engagement 
with said buckle (22) when said seat belt system (20) is deployed 

and secured about the occupant; characterized in that said seat 
belt retractor assembly (32) is mounted to one of said seat 

back frame (66; 122; 160) or said seat bottom frame (56; 158), 
said seat belt buckle (22) is anchored to the other lateral 

side of said seat bottom frame (56; 158) or said track mechanism 
(16; 156), and said seat back frame (66; 122, 160) includes 

an elongated reinforced member (96;96') extending along a first 
lateral side thereof that is fixedly connected at its lower 

end to said hinge mechanism and has mounted at its upper end 
a guide means (34; 178, 180) for receiving said seat belt (24) 

to direct said seat belt (24) over the shoulder of the occupant, 
said elongated reinforced member (96; 96') being of sufficient 

strength and rigidity to withstand the compressive, torsional, 
and bending loads exerted thereon as occur under severe loading 

of said seat belt (24) in an accident condition so that said 
loads are transferred from said elongated reinforced member 

 
(96, 96'), through said hinge mechanism, to said seat bottom 

frame (56; 158), said track mechanism (16; 156), and the floor 
of the vehicle. 
The vehicle seat of Claim 1, characterized by a second 
reinforced member extending along substantially the entire length 

of said one lateral side of said seat bottom frame (56; 158). 
The vehicle of Claim 2, characterized in that the 
rearward end of said second reinforced member is connected to 

said hinge mechanism. 
The vehicle seat of Claim 2 or 3, characterized in 
that said second reinforced member is connected to said track 

mechanism (16; 156). 
The vehicle seat of any of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
by brace means (106) for securing said upper end of said 

elongated reinforcement member (96; 96') to an upper portion 
of the seat back frame (66; 122; 160). 
The vehicle of any of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that said elongated reinforcement member (96; 96') is an 

open-channel structural member. 
The vehicle seat of any of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that said track mechanism (16; 156) includes a pair of 

laterally spaced lower tracks (52) that are adapted to be secured 
to the reinforcement floor structure (18) of the vehicle, and 

a pair of carriages (54) that are slidably mounted on said lower 
tracks (52) for longitudinal fore and aft movement relative 

thereto, said seat bottom frame (56; 158) being secured to said 
carriages (54) for longitudinal movement of said seat relative 

to the floor structure (18). 
The vehicle of any of Claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that said hinge mechanism comprises a recliner means (44; 

166) for connecting the seat back frame (66, 122; 160) for 
reclining angular movement relative to the seat bottom frame 

(56; 158). 
The vehicle seat of Claim 8 characterized in that 
said recliner means (44; 166) has a first member (46; 168) fixed 

to said elongated reinforcement member (96; 96') and the seat 
back frame (66; 122; 160) and a second member fixed to the seat 

bottom frame (56; 158). 
The vehicle seat of any of Claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that said retractor assembly (32) is operable for inhibiting 

withdrawal of said safety belt therefrom upon the vehicle being
