<ABSTRACT>
A soundproofing member for forming a sound barrier. Each member includes a substantially plane panel (1) of predetermined height and an angled portion (2) consisting of a substantially plane strip. The angled portion magnetized to one end of the panel (1) and the plane of the angled portion are at an angle  alpha  of 7-35 DEG  relative to the plane of the panel. The member may be used to control noise from high-speed rail vehicles or road traffic.

Element for protection against noise in the form 
of sound waves, intended by assembly to form an antinoise 

protection wall, which element comprises a substantially 
planar panel (1) of determined height (H) and an angled 

shield (2) formed by a substantially planar band and mounted 
at one end of the panel, characterized in that the plane 

containing the angled shield is inclined with respect to the 
plane containing the panel by an angle α lying between 7° 

and 55°, and in that the said angled shield has a border 
(203) forming a leading edge or trailing edge for the sound 

waves, the said border having a continuous curvature in a 
cross-sectional plane of the panel and of the angled shield. 
Element according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the band forming the said angled shield (2) has a 

transverse dimension (h) such that this dimension, projected 
into the plane of the said panel, lies between 10/100 and 

30/100 of the height of the said panel. 
Element according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the said angled shield (2) is attached onto one of 

the edges of the said panel (1). 
Element according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the said angled shield (2) and the said panel (1) 

are monobloc and formed from the same material. 
Element according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the leading edge is straight and parallel to the plane 

of the panel. 
Element according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the said leading edge has, in the cross-sectional plane 

of the panel and of the angled shield, a continuously 
varying radius of curvature, this radius of curvature having 

its minimum values at the distal end of the angled shield. 
Element according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the panel (1) and the angled shield 

(2) include a sound-energy absorbent lining. 
Element according to Claim 7, characterized in  
 

that the sound-energy absorbent lining consists of an 
absorbent layer. 
Element according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the said absorbent layer is provided with grooves 

(100), pointing in the height direction of the panel, the 
said grooves, a succession of alternate teeth and notches, 

having a depth p of the notches for a distance e between 
longitudinal plane of symmetry of two successive notches, in 

a ratio p/e = ρ, such that 0.76 ≤ ρ ≤ 0.85 for maximum noise 
attenuation in a sound frequency band lying between 100 Hz 

and 5000 Hz. 
Use of a noise protection element according to 
one of Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that, in order to 

reduce the noise generated by a traffic route, a plurality 
of elements is mounted contiguously on at least one of the 

sides of the traffic route, the leading edge of the angled 
shield pointing towards the axis of the traffic route. 
Use according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that, for a traffic route formed by a railway track with 

spacing a, each panel has a height x.a, with 2.5 ≤ x ≤ 4, 
the said panels being mounted opposite at a distance y.a, 

with 3 ≤ y ≤ 6, symmetrically with the axis of the track, 
the said angled shields being oriented towards the central 

axis of the track.
