<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polymer composition for 
hydrophilic treatment which can be employed for hydrophilizating 
the surface of an aluminum member or an aluminum alloy member 
such as an aluminum fin member for a heat exchanger, for example, 
thereby inhibiting or preventing development of waterdrops, and 
a method of forming a hydrophilic polymer coating. It is known that moisture which is contained in the 
atmosphere condenses into waterdrops on a fin of a heat exchanger 
such as an air conditioner in cooling, to easily cause clogging 
with the waterdrops. Such clogging results in reduction in 
exchange efficiency of the heat exchanger caused by increase in 
ventilation resistance, generation of a noise, and contamination 
caused by splashing of the waterdrops. In order to prevent such 
problems, there have been proposed a number of methods for 
hydrophilizating the surface of a fin member of a heat exchanger 
and improving wettability. For example, Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 53-48177 
(1978) and 55-1347 (1980) and Japanese Patent Laying-Open Nos. 
58-126989 (1983) and 59-13078 (1984) disclose methods of 
performing hydrophilic treatment with silicate such as water  
 
glass. As to methods of hydrophilic treatment employing organic 
resin, Japanese Patent Laying-Open Nos. 3-26381 (1991) and 1-299877 
(1989), for example, disclose methods employing polyvinyl 
alcohol in combination with specific water-soluble polymers and 
water-soluble cross linking agents. Further, Japanese Patent 
Laying-Open Nos. 2-107678 (1990) and 2-202967 (1990) disclose 
methods employing block copolymers consisting of hydrophilic 
polymer parts and hydrophobic polymer parts of specific 
hydrophilic monomers in combination with metal chelate cross 
linking agents. In addition, Japanese Patent Laying-Open Nos. 
1-104667 (1989), 1-268747 (1989) and 1-270977 (1989) disclose 
methods employing polyacrylic amide resin. However, an inorganic treatment agent having excellent 
hydrophilicity such as silicate which is proposed in some of the 
aforementioned gazettes has specific odor, while fine powder is 
scattered by decomposition of a coating. When this inorganic 
treatment agent is applied to the so-called precoat treatment of 
hydrophilizating an aluminum plate and thereafter working the 
same into a heat exchanger, further, a die is easily consumed in 
the working. On the other hand, the organic resin treatment agent which 
is proposed in the remaining ones of the aforementioned gazettes 
is not much problematic
