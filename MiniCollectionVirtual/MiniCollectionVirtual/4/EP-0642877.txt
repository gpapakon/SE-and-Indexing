<ABSTRACT>
A welding wire that forms weld metal having excellent high-temperature creep strength, toughness and welding 
performance when used in the inert-gas arc welding of a high-chromium ferritic heat-resisting steel, such as 9 - 12 % 

Cr steel, used for various electrical generation boilers, chemical pressure vessels and the like. The wire comprises, on 
the weight basis, 0.03 - 0.12 % of carbon, at most 0.5 % of silicon, 0.3 - 1.5 % of manganese, 8 - 13 % of chromium, 

0.05 - 1.2 % of nickel, 0.3 - 1.6 % of molybdenum, 0.5 - 2.5 % of tungsten, 0.03 - 0.40 % of vanadium, 0.01 - 0.15 
% of niobium, 0.0005 - 0.0006 % of boron, 0.01 - 0.08 % of nitrogen, and the balance substantially consisting of iron 

and inevitable impurities, wherein the total content of molybdenum and tungsten is 2.8 % or below.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a filler material
suitable for welding of a high-strength heat-resisting
steel having high toughness, and more specifically to an
inert gas are welding wire which can form a weld metal
having excellent creep properties, toughness and cracking
resistance at high temperatures.The inert gas arc welding is arc welding which is
carried out in a gas atmosphere of an inert gas, such as
argon or helium, or a gas atmosphere comprising the inert
gas and, added thereto, a minor amount of an active gas.
It is classified into two types, that is, TIG welding as
nonconsumable electrode welding and MIG welding as
consumable electrode welding. In TIG welding, a tungsten
electrode is used, and a filler material is supplied
separately from the electrode. On the other hand, in MIG,
welding, a welding wire (a filler material), as such, is
used as an electrode.The development of a ferritic heat-resisting steel
as a steel product for high-temperature, high-efficiency
energy plants, which has a very high creep strength and
is less susceptible to stress corrosion cracking such as
is observed in an austenitic stainless steel, has been
strongly desired in the art, and such a ferritic heat-resisting
steel has begun to be actually used.As a filler material or a welding wire for use in
welding of the above ferrite heat-resisting steel, for
example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai)
No. 60-257991 proposes a welding wire for a 9Cr-Mo-base
steel, which welding wire comprises C, Si, Mn, Cr, Mo and
Ni in respective specified contents with at least one of 
Nb and V being added thereto in a total content of not
more than 0.3%. Further, Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication (Kokai) No. 2-280993 proposes an 8-12Cr-base
filler material or welding wire which comprises C, Si,
Mn, Cr, Ni, Mo, W, V, Nb, Al and N in respective contents
specified so as to give a Creq value of 13.The above conventional filler materials or welding
wires, however, cannot be expected to have a markedly
improved creep strength and, further, have a drawback
that δ ferrite precipitates in a martensitic phase to
markedly lower the toughness. The δ ferrite is much
softer than martensite as the matrix. A metallic
structure comprising a hard martensitic matrix and,
dispersed therein, δ ferrite has a very low impact
toughness. ofFurther, JP-A-63-188492 discloses a TIG welding wire for 9Cr-Mo
steels which contains no B (boron), and WO92/00158 discloses
a method of powder-metallurgically manufacturing full bodies
from high
