<ABSTRACT>
It is known to use autoloaders for presenting 
X-ray cassettes to a reader so that they can be processed 

in succession without the attention of an operator. 
However, the readers used are sensitive to vibrations and 

these need to be substantially eliminated. Described 
herein is an improved autoloader apparatus which 

comprises a body portion which houses a plurality of 
cassette retaining sites (44, 46). The apparatus 

includes a pair of guide panels (45, 47) positioned on 
either side of the cassette retaining sites (44, 46), 

each guide panel (45, 47) having a guide surface (40) and 
a shock-absorbing protective layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements
relating to cassette autoloaders and is more particularly
concerned with autoloaders which feed cassettes and/or
pallets containing cassettes to and receive them from a
computed radiography reader.In computed radiography, a storage phosphor
plate/film is typically provided in a light-tight
cassette. This storage phosphor film is read by
photoelectrically detecting an image formed by scanning
the plate with stimulating radiation. An example of such
a scanner/reader is disclosed in US-A-4 789 782. It is
desirable to retain the storage phosphor's plate/film
within the cassette except during actual processing.It has also been suggested in the prior art to
provide an apparatus to automate the presentation on such
X-ray cassettes or similar cassette to the reader so that
the X-ray cassettes can be processed in succession
without the attention of an operator. An example of a
suitable device for presenting cassettes is disclosed in
co-pending European patent publication no. 0 607 521,
entitled "Cassette Autoloader" and European patent
publication no. 0 544 326, entitled "X-Ray Cassette
Positioner".In these applications there is disclosed, a
positioner/autoloader for use with a plurality of X-ray
cassettes and/or pallets containing cassettes. The
apparatus includes first and second cog belts spaced
apart so as to provide a plurality of cassette retaining
sites, one of which defines a cassette presentation site
for presenting cassettes to the reader. The belts are
driven such that the cassettes are individually
positioned at the presentation site for removal of the 
photosensitive material therein for reading by the reader
and after which the photosensitive material is returned
to the cassette. The positioner allows a plurality of
individual cassettes to be placed on the cassette
retaining sites for automatically supplying to the reader
individual cassettes in succession, thus freeing the
operator to accomplish other duties.It is important that the mechanism be designed
to operate in such manner so as to minimize any transfer
of vibrations from the autoloader to the reader which can
adversely affect the reader reading the information on
the photostimulable phosphorous material. In such
devices, it is typical that the autoloader will be loaded
and/or unloaded during scanning of a photostimulable
phosphorous material in the adjacent reader. Often the
loading and unloading procedure produces shock vibrations
which can be transmitted to the adjacent reader. Since

Apparatus (10) for storing and
automatically delivering X-ray cassettes (20) and/or pallets

containing X-ray cassettes (20) to a reader (12), the apparatus
comprising:-


a storage and delivery mechanism (36, 38, 40,
42) having a plurality of cassette retaining sites (44,

46) defining loading sites, unloading sites and a read
site (46) in which a cassette is accessible by the reader;
a body portion (14, 16) encasing the storage
and delivery mechanism (36, 38, 40, 42), the body portion

(14, 16) having a portal (26) adjoining the cassette
retaining sites (44, 46) for allowing cassettes (20) to

be introduced into and removed from the storage and
delivery mechanism (36, 38, 40, 42);
at least one guide panel (45, 47) positioned
adjacent the portal (26) and having a guide surface (68,

90) with a shock-absorbing protective means (92) for
guiding the cassettes (20) into the cassette retaining

sites (44, 46),

   characterized in that each guide panel (45, 47)
includes an internal support member (90) which is substantially

encapsulated in a plastic/elastomeric material, the
material forming an outer protective layer (92) which covers the support member and forming a

mounting section (94) for mounting each guide panel (45,
47) to a supporting structure (90) of the apparatus (10).
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein
the plastic/elastomeric material has a hardness in the

range between 60 Shore A to 70 Shore D.
