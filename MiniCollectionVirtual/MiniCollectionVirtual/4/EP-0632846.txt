<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement is disclosed for coating small parts, such as scres and bolts, in a highly efficient manner as bulk goods, by high-vacuum metallizing or by vacuum sputtering, also under the effect of a plasma. A drum (1) that rotates at a high speed around a horizontal axis and upon whose inner wall the parts to be coated are held by centrifugal force is arranged inside a container. The surface of the inner wall is designed so that the parts to be coated (3) are securely held and moved together with the wall. Coating means are arranged in the drum. A scraper device (4), whose spacing from the inner wall can be adjusted at programmable time intervals, is provided in the drum and its contact surface is oriented in the direction opposite to the direction of rotation.

Apparatus for the vacuum coating of bulk goods by vacuum 
deposition, sputtering or plasma-activated coating, comprising a 

drum rotating in constant manner about its horizontal axis at a 
speed such that the pieces for coating located therein are held by 

centrifugal force on the drum surface, as well as coating devices 
and flow resistance means located in the drum, characterized in that 

the inner wall of the drum (1) has a geometrical surface structure 
such that the pieces (3) to be coated are reliably fixed in the rotation 

direction of the drum (1) and can be moved on together with the 
latter, and that in the drum (1) is provided a stripper (4), whose 

spacing from the inner wall can be adjusted and which can be switched 
off at programmable time intervals, said stripper for the pieces (3) 

to be coated being positioned with an abutting surface directed counter 
to the rotation direction of the drum (1). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the surface 
structure of the inner wall of the drum (1) is formed by axially directed 

notches (13), whose sides are steep in the rotation direction 
and shallow counter to the rotation direction. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in that the spacing 
of the notches (13) is smaller than the average length of the pieces 

(3) to be coated. 
Apparatus according to claims 1 to 3, characterized in that in 
the drum (1) is provided an emptying device (12) stripping the pieces 

(3) from the drum inner wall or receiving same in another area so that, 
in conjunction with a guiding device (11), it passes same outwards via 

an air lock. 
Apparatus according to claims 1 to 4, characterized in that in 
the wall of the drum (1) are formed cooling ducts (2) through which 

flows a coolant.  
 
Apparatus according to claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the 
drum (1) has a double wall construction and c oolant flows through 

the cavity. 
Apparatus according to claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the 

coating device is at least one sputtering source. 
Apparatus according to claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the 
coating device is at least one electron beam vaporizer (6). 
Apparatus according to claim 8, characterized in that a pivotable 
shield (6') is positioned above each electron beam vaporizer (6). 
Apparatus according to claims 1 to 9, characterized in that outside 
the drum (1) is provided a fixed filling device (10) in conjunction 

with an air lock with a guiding device leading into the drum 
(1). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that on the 
abutting surface of the stripper (4) are provided resilient elements 

or brushes directed against the wall of the drum (1). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 and at least one of the claims 
6 to 11, characterized in that in the drum (1) are provided guide 

plates in such a way that during the rotation of the drum (1) the 
pieces (3) are movable from the centre of the drum (1) to the edge 

and vice versa. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 and at least one of the claims 
6 to 12, characterized in that in the coating zone are provided an 

electron beam vaporizer (6) and a sputtering source, which are separated 
from one another by flow resistance means or walls. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 and at least one of the claims 6 
to 13, characterized in that, apart from the electron beam vaporizer  

 
(6), in the rotation direction upstream of the latter is provided 

a plasma or ion source (7) shielded from the remaining inner area. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 and at least one of the claims 
2 to 14, characterized in that on either side of the drum (1) on 

the circumference are provided inwardly directed edges.
