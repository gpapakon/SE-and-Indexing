<ABSTRACT>
A snow melting member for use on a power transmission 
line which can sufficiently melt snow even when the magnetic 

field created by the current in the power transmission line 
is relatively small. The snow melting member is composed of 

metals or metal oxides and has an annular, tubular or helical 
configuration for surrounding the outer periphery of the 

power transmission line. The snow melting member is provided 
with the dimensions and electromagnetic properties defined by 

the following formulas:


H× B
H
 ≧ 40,000; and 
0.7≦ t₀(B
H
/ρ · H)
1/2
≦ 7. 



 
By winding an iron alloy wire containing 1 to 15% by weight 

of aluminum around the power transmission line, or by 
attaching an iron alloy ring onto the power transmission 

line, heat is generated even when a relatively small amount 
of current flows through the power transmission line, thereby 

melting snow or ice sticking to the power transmission line.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a snow-melting member that 
prevents snow from sticking or piling up on an overhead 
power-transmission line by melting the snow as it falls down 
on the overhead power-transmission line. The invention further relates to a snow-melting member 
for use on a power-transmission line that positively prevents 
snow from sticking or piling up on the power-transmission 
line. Falling snow sticking to overhead power-transmission 
lines is a problem, especially in snowy regions. When snow 
collects on power-transmission lines, it adds weight to the 
lines. Further, when the snow falls off a power-transmission 
line, the load on the power-transmission line abruptly 
changes. Consequently, the power-transmission line may snap, 
an associated iron tower may collapse, or houses, green 
houses or other structures under the power-transmission line 
may be damaged. To prevent snow from sticking to a power-transmission 
line, an annular or linear magnetic body, for 
example, is attached around the outer periphery of the power-transmission 
line in a known method. The change in magnetic 
flux in the magnetic body resulting from the alternating 
current passing through the power-transmission line, causes  
 
core loss in the magnetic body. Heat generated by the core 
loss melts the snow falling on the power-transmission line and 
thereby prevents snow from sticking to the power-transmission 
line. However, in the winter season, only about 10% or less of 
the allowable current is transmitted by some power-transmission 
lines. Consequently, the magnetic field applied 
to the magnetic body attached around the outer periphery of 
the power-transmission line is decreased to about 10 Oe or 
less. The generated heat is also decreased in proportion to 
the resulting decrease in core loss. Therefore, the aforementioned 
conventional preventive measures can not sufficiently 
melt the snow. Snow can be sufficiently prevented from sticking 
to the power-transmission line by this measure only in regions 
having little snowfall. The conventional preventive measures 
are thus limited in their effective geographical application 
and use.  
 Further snow melting members for a power-transmission line are 
known from patent abstracts of Japan, vols. 14 and 15:
