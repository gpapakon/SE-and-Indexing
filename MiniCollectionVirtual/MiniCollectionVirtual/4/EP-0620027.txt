<ABSTRACT>
This ski includes longitudinal reinforcing elements (9) each bearing on an edge (8), and forming the side walls of the ski, which extend, at least in the case of one of them, over a part of the height of the latter, and a shell (10) forming the topsheet (upper face) and a part of at least one of the lateral walls of the ski, and the longitudinal sides (12) of which rest and are fastened on the topsheet of the side walls (9), the respective heights of a side wall and of the shell over at least one of the side faces of the ski varying in the same proportions over the length of the ski.

 the
two reinforcing elements of one and the same ski have

characteristics of shape and/or concerning the nature of the
materials constituting them which are different from one

element to the other.
Ski according to any one of Claims 7 to 11,
characterized in that
 each reinforcing element
