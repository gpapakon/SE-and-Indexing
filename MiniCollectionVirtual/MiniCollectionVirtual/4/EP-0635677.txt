<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a flameholder plate (1) for a gas-mixture burner (80). This plate, which has passages (27) running through it for the circulation through it of the gases, comprises in its construction, a compressed network of interlaced metal wire(s), forming between them said passages for the gases. The plate can be produced by rolling up a band of interlaced wires, by stacking sections of band or by folding this band. Such a plate can in particular be used for being mounted on domestic burners.

<CLAIMS>
Flameholder plate (1) for a gas burner for a mixture
of gases comprising at least one flexible metal wire (12)

defining a compressed mesh network (2) permitting the flow of gas
through it, characterised in that the mesh (2) of wire(s)

(12) is a flattened knitted tube (10) comprising one or
several sections.
Plate according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the (each) tube section (10) comprises a single wire

(12).
Flameholder plate according to either of Claims 1 to
2, characterised in that it is constituted by a roll (22)

formed by rolling the strip (21), constituted by the said
flattened tube (10), the axis (25) of the roll being

substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis (46)
of the strip (21).
Flameholder plate according to either of Claims 1 to
2, characterised in that it is constituted by a stack

(40a) of several sections (42a) of the strip (21) which
is constituted by the said flattened tube (10) following

a given direction (45a) of stacking of the sections
(42a).
Flameholder plate according to either of Claims 1 to 
2, characterised in that it is constituted by a set of

folds (40) of the strip (21) which is constituted by the
said flattened tube (10), following a given direction

(45) of stacking of the folds.
Gas burner for a mixture of gases comprising a
distribution chamber (81) supplied with combustion air

and with combustible gas and communicating with a
combustion chamber (82), with a flameholder plate (1)

according to any of the preceding claims positioned
between them.
A method of manufacturing a flameholder plate (1)
for a burner for a mixture of gases comprising at least

one flexible metal wire (12) defining a compressed mesh network (2)
permitting the flow of gas across it, characterised in

that:

there is provided a mesh (2) of wire(s) with
interlaced parts defining a knitted tube (10) composed of

at least one flexible metal wire (12) resistant to
temperatures of the order of approximately 1000°C to

1200°C,
the said knitted tube (10) is flattened along fold
lines (16 and 18) substantially parallel to its

longitudinal axis (20) in order to obtain a flat mesh
(2),
this flattened mesh (2) is shaped so as to give the
general shape of a plate (1), 
and the mesh (2) thus shaped is compressed in such
a way that, in a compressed state, it permits the flow of

gas across it.
Method according to Claim 7, characterised in that
in order to shape the said mesh (2), the strip (21) which

is constituted by the said flattened tube (10) is wound
on itself, the roll (22) thus formed being compressed

substantially along its axis (25) and/or substantially
perpendicular with respect to this axis (25).
Method according to Claim 7, characterised in that
in order to shape the said mesh (2), the strip (21) which

is constituted by the said flattened tube (10), is folded
back on itself at least once, following a given direction

(45) of stacking of the folds, the stack (40) thus
obtained being compressed following a (some) direction(s)

substantially parallel and/or perpendicular to the said
direction (45) of stacking of the folds.
Method according to Claim 7, characterised in that
in order to shape the said mesh (2), the strip (21) which

is constituted by the said flattened tube (10), is cut
into sections (42a) which sections are stacked on one

another along a given direction (45a) of stacking of the
sections, the stack (40a) thus obtained being compressed

along a (some) direction(s) substantially parallel and/or
perpendicular to the said direction (45a) of stacking of 

the sections.
