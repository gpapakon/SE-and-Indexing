<ABSTRACT>
A driving pinion (15) turns on an axis (16) at right angles to the frame, and meshes with a driving rack (18) contg. one or two sets of teeth. A double pinion (19) has portions (21,22) of different dias., on an axis (20) at right angles to that of the driving pinion and extending in the plane of the frame. One or more output racks (24) are coupled by bosses (13) to the driving rods (4). The teeth (17) of the driving pinion, and those of the smaller part of the double pinion, mesh with the driving rack. The teeth of the larger part of the double pinion mesh with those (23) of the output rack.

Connecting rod drive (9) having toothed gearing for a 
door or window leaf, of which the frame profile comprises a 

peripheral guide groove (3) to receive connecting rods (4), 
characterised by 


a driving pinion (15) having an axis of rotation (15)[sic] 

extending transverse to the leaf frame (1), 
at least one driving toothed rod (18) having one or two 
toothed regions, 
at least one stepped toothed wheel (19) having two toothed 
steps (21, 22) of different diameters, of which the axis of 

rotation (20) extends offset by 90Â° with respect to the axis 
of rotation (16) of the driving pinion (15) in the direction 

of the plane of the window or door leaf and 
at least one driven toothed rod (24), which is connected by 
spigots (13) to the connecting rod (4) 

and in that 
the toothed region (17) of the driving pinion (15) and of 
the smaller toothed step (21) of the stepped toothed wheel 

(19) engage the driving toothed rod (18) and 
the toothed region of the larger toothed step (22) of the 
stepped toothed wheel (19) is connected to the toothed region 

(23) of the driven toothed rod (24). 
Connecting rod drive according to claim 1, characterised 
by an inner square recess (11) in the driving pinion (15) 

into which the actuating handle (6) engages with a square 
shaft (8). 
Connecting rod drive according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised by a spring loaded operating error block which 

engages with at least one hook (27) into a recess (28) of the 
driven toothed rod (24) or the driving toothed rod (18) and 

is released by a pressure plate (14) against the resilient  
 

force. 
Connecting rod drive according to one or more of claims 1 
to 3, characterised by a housing (12) which contains, guides 

and surrounds the movement and gearing elements. 
Connecting rod drive according to claim 4, characterised 
by a lug (29, 30) on the housing (12), which engages a recess 

in the spar profile of the leaf frame (11) [sic]. 
Connecting rod drive according to claim 4 or claim 5, 
characterised by a projection extending under the housing 

(12), or a rib (32) extending in the same manner transverse 
to the direction of the groove (3), which projection or rib 

engages in a form fit manner in a recess (33) of one or both 
limbs of the groove (34).
