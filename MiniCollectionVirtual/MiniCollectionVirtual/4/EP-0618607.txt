<ABSTRACT>
Incandescent reflector lamps of the R and ER type 
having a metallic light-reflecting coating (34) inside 

exhibit a pleasing soft white appearance with 
substantially diminished glare and filament hot spots 

when the forward, light-projecting portion of the lamp 
envelope is coated with a coating (36) comprising a silicone 

containing untreated titanium dioxide particles of a 
relatively coarse or large size.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a soft white reflector 
lamp. More particularly, this invention relates to a 
reflector lamp comprising a filament as the light 
source enclosed within a glass envelope having a 
parabolic reflecting portion and with the forward, 
light-transmitting portion coated with a silicone 
coating containing coarse particles of titanium dioxide 
for dispersing the filament image and producing an 
aesthetically and visually pleasing soft white effect. Electric lamps employing a filament or arc as the 
source of light emit light in a pattern in which the 
light source is visible, unless the emitted light is 
broken up. Further, unless there is a light-diffusing 
means between the source of light and the object Qr 
area to be illuminated, the light source can also 
produce unpleasant glare and bright spots in the beam 
and the lamp itself is unpleasant to look at due to the 
glare from the surface of the lamp and the concentrated 
light intensity coming from the light source. Means 
commonly employed to break up a light source image 
include a lenticuled lens (in the case of certain types 
of reflector lamps), sandblasting the lamp envelope, 
acid etching the lamp envelope or coating the lamp 
envelope with a powder coating on the interior surface 
to scatter the emitted light and diffuse the light  
 
source image. Acid etching or coating the interior 
surface of a lamp envelope is most commonly found in a 
conventional household type of incandescent lamp 
wherein the glass envelope enclosing the filament is 
acid etched (frosted) and/or coated with a particulate, 
light-diffusing material. A mixture of clay and silica 
is often used as the particulate, light-scattering 
material, because of its availability, light-scattering 
properties, chemical inertness and ability to withstand 
the high temperatures reached during lamp operation. 
However, with the exception of acid etching, none of 
these methods are suitable for use with the type of 
reflector lamps commonly known as R or ER lamps, 
wherein the lamp comprises a unitary, blown glass 
envelope enclosing a filament within and having an 
internal reflecting surface on which is disposed light-reflecting 
material for reflecting a portion of the 
light emitted by the filament forward of the lamp 
through the clear or acid etched, light-transmissive 
forward portion. These R and ER lamps are used as 
decorative lamps and also to provide light illumination 
in a particular direction and have found wide 
application both commercially and in

<CLAIMS>
A lamp (10) comprising a vitreous envelope (12) 
enclosing an electric light source (26), at least a forward 

portion (14) of said envelope being externally coated with 
a coating (36) comprising a silicone material containing 

coarse, light-scattering particles that are not treated 
with an organic compound, said particles having a particle 

size distribution whereby over 50% is retained on 325 mesh 
screen. 
The lamp of claim 1, wherein said light-scattering 
particles comprise titanium dioxide which gives said lamp 

a soft white appearance when energized. 
The lamp of claim 2 wherein said titanium dioxide 
is rutile titanium dioxide. 
The lamp of claim 1, wherein said silicone 
comprises a silicone polyester. 
A lamp according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
being a reflector lamp 

including a 
side light-reflecting portion (16).
