<ABSTRACT>
A periodic line and space pattern made of chromium film is 
formed on a glass substrate, and a phase shifter is arranged on 

every other transparent portion of the line and space pattern. 
Using a stepper and the phase shift mask, photoresist film coated 

on a wafer is exposed several times to light of i-line by varying 
the focus, then developed. Next, the width Ws of the photoresist 

pattern formed by the exposure to the light through the phase 
shifter, and the width Wo of the photoresist pattern formed by 

the exposure to the light without passing through the phase 
shifter are measured. Based on the relation between Ws and Wo 

for defocusing, the transmittance error and the phase shift angle 
error of the phase shifter are obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a phase shift mask to be 
used in a photolithogaraphy step of semiconductor fabrication and 
an inspection method thereof, and more particularly to an 
inspection method for measuring transmittance error and phase 
shift angle error of a phase shifter and a phase shift mask used 
therefor. Phase-shifting technology has been expected as one of useful 
method to enhance the performance of optical lithography. It is 
necessary to control with high precision transmittance and phase 
shift angle of the phase shifter to obtain good results. 
Heretofore, the measurement of transmittance error of a phase 
shifter of the mask has been measured by, for example, a self-spectrophotometer 
having light beam diameter of about 5 mm. The 
transmittance error is defined as the percentage of drop in the 
transmittance of the transparent portion where the phase shifter 
is placed when the transmittance of the transparent portion where 
the phase shifter is absent is taken as 100 %. In addition, 
regarding the measurement of the phase shift angle of the phase 
shifter, there is proposed a method of mechanically measuring the 
film thickness of the phase shifter by, for example, a 
profilometer in which a needle is brought into contact with the 
phase shifter to trace the thickness, then calculating the phase 
shift angle, or a method which is disclosed in A.P.Ghosh and  
 
D B Dove,"Direct Phase Measurements in Phase Shift Masks", SPIE, 
Vol. 1673 (1992), pp. 242-249. The proposed phase shift angle 
measurement is shown in a sectional diagram in Fig. 1. Light 
beam emitted by a He-Ne laser 7 is split by a half mirror 8 into 
light beam B1 which is transmitted through a phase shifter 3 of 
a phase shift mask (consisting of a glass substrate 1, a chromium 
film 2 for forming a pattern, and a phase shifter 3) and light 
beam B2 which is transmitted through the adjacent portion where 
the phase shifter is absent. Then, light beams B1 and B2 are 
focused by a lens 9 on the surface of the phase shift mask. 
Finally, the too light beams B1 and B2 those are transmitted 
through the phase shift mask are combined again by a lens 9 and 
a half mirror 8, their interference intensity is determined by 
an optical interferometer 10, and the phase shift angle error is 
determined by calculating the phase difference from the value of 
the interference intensity. The phase shift angle error is 
defined as the deviation from the phase shift angle of 180° at 
which the maximum effect of the phase shift method
