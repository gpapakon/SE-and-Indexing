<ABSTRACT>
An optical disk apparatus in which data is stored in internal registers (21 - 25) of 
a digital signal processor (13) need not be saved and returned when a servo 

processing based on an interrupt processing routine is executed. Internal registers 
of the digital signal processor are allocated. At least one group of the divided 

internal registers is exclusively allocated to the execution of a servo signal 
processing interrupt routine and the other groups of internal registers are 

exclusively allocated to execute a system control processing. With such 
allocations, when a sampling interrupt occurs, servo signal processing of a focus 

servo signal processing and a tracking servo processing is carried out without 
saving data from the internal registers of the digital signal processor. After servo 

processing is completed, the interrupt processing routine can be ended without 

returning data to the internal registers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an optical disk apparatus, and in
particular to memory allocation within an optical disk apparatus.Optical disk apparatus have hitherto used a digital signal processor ("DSP") in
order digitally process servo signals through the execution of programs or routines,
which are also referred to as software or firmware.In software servo processing, a focusing error signal and a tracking error signal
contained within an output signal of a quadrant diode type of optical pickup are
converted by an analog-to-digital ("A/D") converting circuit into digital signals. These
digital signals are supplied through a bus line to a DSP. The DSP then processes these
digital signals supplied thereto in accordance with a predetermined routine or program
in some suitable signal processing fashion, such as a phase compensation or the like.
The processed digital signals are supplied through a digital-to-analog ("D/A") converting
circuit and a driver to a focusing actuator and to a tracking actuator of the optical
pickup.In a conventional optical disk apparatus in which the DSP executes the software
servo processing, the DSP is also utilized to execute processing other than the servo
processing, such as system control or the like. In such a conventional optical disk
apparatus, servo processing has a higher interrupt processing priority. Therefore, at the
beginning of the interrupt processing (interrupt routine), data in the internal registers of
the DSP are stored in and saved in a data RAM of the DSP. At the completion of
interrupt processing, data is returned to the internal registers from the data RAM.A typical digital signal processor used in conventional optical disk apparatus is one
manufactured and sold by the Motorola, Inc., Semiconductor Products Sector, 3102
North 56th Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85018 under the model designation DSP56001.
The DSP56001 is a 24-bit fixed-point general purpose digital signal processor which
features three single-cycle execution units, namely, a data arithmetic logic unit, an
address arithmetic unit and a program controller, all of which operate in parallel at
instruction speeds of up to 16.5 MHz. The DSP56001 also contains an on-chip program
random access memory (RAM). Using such a DSP, a time or period corresponding to
68 steps is required in order to save and return data because this DSP contains a total of
34 internal registers. In further detail, assuming an operation speed of the DSP is 100
nsec/step, and a servo signal sampling rate of 30 kHz,
