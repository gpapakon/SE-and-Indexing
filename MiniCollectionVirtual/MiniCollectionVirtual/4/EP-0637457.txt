<ABSTRACT>
The valve (2) shuts at a set temperature, its plug being normally held open by a pressurised hollow body (5). This has a fracture point, and is of material melting at the set temperature. The fracture point can be formed by a reaction pipe (8) and the body can be arranged to engage with the actuating mechanism (4) or directly with the plug (6). It can also have a pressure-monitoring device, and there can be two bodies one behind the other, they and their reaction pipes being connected in parallel.

<CLAIMS>
Shut-off device, which closes automatically at a defined threshold
temperature, with a shut-off element which is kept in the open position by at

least one element inhibiting a closing force, characterised in that

the shut-off device (2) exhibits, as the element inhibiting the closing force, at
least one pressurised hollow body (5) whose volume can be changed and

which is designed as a bellows or a pressure pad, and which has at least one
predetermined break-off feature which is made of a material whose melt

temperature is set to a defined threshold temperature.
Shut-off device according to claim 1, characterised in that

the predetermined break-off feature is designed as a reaction line (8).
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that

the closing force is produced by an activation element (6) which acts on an
activation device (4).
Shut-off device according to any one of claims 1 through 3, characterised in
that

the hollow body 5 acts on the activation device (4) or directly on the activation
element (6).
Shut-off device according to any one of claims 1 through 4, characterised in
that

the hollow body (5) exhibits a pressure-monitoring feature (7).
Shut-off device according to any one of claims 1 through 5, characterised in
that

two hollow bodies (5) are arranged one after the other and the relevant
reaction lines (8) parallel to each other. 
Shut-off device according to any one of claims 1 through 6, characterised in
that

the activation element (6) or the activation device (4) or the shut-off element
can be fixed by means of a locking device (10).
