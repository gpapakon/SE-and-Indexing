<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a high speed, synchronous counter (102) 
which counts using a Gray code. Because Gray code counting 

has the unique property that only a single bit of the 
counter changes with each new count, the output of the 

counter (102) may be latched at any time and the latched 
value will never be more than one count away from the 

actual count value in the counter. The present invention 
provides a look-ahead qualification bit (240) that provides 

for an eight count look-ahead. With this eight count look-ahead 
capability, the qualification inputs to the high 

order bits can be created through a series of AND gates 
(418, 420, 422, 424), each having only two inputs, thus 

saving significant power and space. Because most digital 
circuits require the output of a counter to be in binary 

code, the invention provides a conversion means (106) for 
converting the Gray code output to a binary output.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to digital electronic circuits and more 
particularly to digital counting circuits. Even more particularly, 
the invention relates to a high speed synchronous digital counter 
with asynchronous read-out capability. When measuring the time between two events, traditional 
circuits have used the occurrence of the first event to start a 
counter which counts clock pulses, and the occurrence of the second 
event to stop the counter. The value of the counter is then read 
to determine the time between the events. After reading the value 
of the counter, the circuit is reset for the next series of events. 
The time during which the circuit is being reset is called dead  
 
time, and during this dead time, occurrences of the events will go 
unnoticed. The performance of the circuit can be improved 
considerably if this dead time can be eliminated, thus creating a 
zero dead time counter. A zero dead time counter must be capable 
of continuously counting, and be capable of allowing an 
asynchronous read-out of the counter which does not interfere with 
counting. When reading the output of the counter asynchronously, 
a metastability problem occurs if a read-out is attempted at the 
time the counter is changing value. If the output is latched while 
one or more bits is changing value, the changing bits could be 
latched as either a one or zero, thus the output is metastable. 
This problem is very severe in binary counters, because many stages 
of the counter of may be changing value simultaneously, for example 
when a carry is being rippled through the counter. In a binary 
counter, if the higher order bits are changing at the time of the 
read-out, a large discrepancy may occur in the count value. Traditionally, this metastability problem has been solved in 
one of two ways, as described by David C. Chu in his article "Phase 
Digitizing: A New Method for Capturing and Analyzing Spread 
Spectrum Signals", Hewlett Packard Journal, February 1989, page 28 
at page 33. Two types of counters can be used for this type of 
circuit. A traditional binary ripple counter consists of series 
of cascaded divide-by-two stages. With the frequency halved after 
each stage, the maximum count rate is effectively determined by the 
first few stages. Subsequent stages do no affect the maximum count 
rate, so they can be slow and numerous. The problem with this type  
 
of counter is the time required for a carry to ripple through all 
stages of the counter. If the output of the counter is read while 
a carry
