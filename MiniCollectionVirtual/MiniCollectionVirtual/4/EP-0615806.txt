<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relate to a cutting tool for trimming a laminate flush with the 
surface of a substantially perpendicular laminate. The cutting tool (20) includes a ball 

bearing guide assembly (22) and a glue well shaft section (21). This glue well shaft 
section prevents softened glue encountered during trimming operations from 

contacting the ball bearing guide assembly. A washer (24) provided between the glue 
well shaft section and the ball bearing guide assembly further prevents softened glue 

encountered during trimming operations from contacting the ball bearing guide 
assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cutting tool according to the
preamble of claim 1 and, in particular, to a cutting tool such as a router
bit, used to trim plastic laminates. In the past,
flush or bevel trimming of laminated plastic was
accomplished by using a carbide tipped router bit.
Such router bits typically include a steel ball-bearing
guide assembly beneath the cutting portion of
the router bit. An example of this type of cutting
tool is disclosed in DE-A-411543.When finishing cabinets, counter tops, etc., a
core material, for example plywood, chip board, or
particle board is covered with a plastic sheet side
apron as well as a plastic sheet top which overhangs
the laminated side apron. These plastic sheets are
typically fixed to the core material with adhesive.
Often, before hardening, this adhesive material is
forced from beneath the sheet, past the edge of the
sheet, to the side and top of the sheet where it then
hardens.When trimming or removing the overhanging (i.e.,
excess) portion of the top sheet, a cutting tool such
as a router bit is used to trim the excess material.
A steel ball-bearing guide assembly disposed closely
beneath the cutting portion of the bit is employed as
a guide and rolls along the side apron thereby
ensuring that the edge of the top sheet is flush with
the side apron sheet. However, due to the friction
resulting from this trimming operation, the
temperature of both the cutting tool and the material
becomes elevated. This increase in temperature causes
previously hardened adhesive to become soft and more 
fluid. It has been found that such soft adhesive
sometimes flows down onto the outer radial surface of,
and into, the ball-bearing guide assembly. When the
adhesive re-hardens, the ball-bearing guide becomes
ineffective and, as a result, the edge of top sheet
being trimmed will not be smooth and flush with the
side apron sheet.Thus, there is a need to provide a cutting tool
such as a router bit for use in the above described
applications in which the ball-bearing guide assembly
is protected from softened adhesive.This invention provides a cutting tool for
trimming a laminate flush with the surface of a
substantially perpendicular laminate, said cutting
tool comprising a first shaft section having an axis
and being adapted to be accommodated in a chuck, a
cutting section co-axial with said first shaft section
and having first and second sides with the first shaft
section adjacent to the first side and a ball-bearing
guide assembly co-axially mounted to the second
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A cutting tool for trimming a laminate flush
with the surface of a substantially perpendicular

laminate, said cutting tool comprising a first shaft
section (27) having an axis and being adapted to be

accommodated in a chuck, a cutting section (20) co-axial
with said first shaft section (27) and having

first and second sides with the first shaft section
adjacent to the first side and a ball-bearing guide

assembly (22) co-axially mounted to the second side of
the cutting section on a second shaft section (23), and a

glue well shaft section (21) between said second side
of the cutting section and second shaft section;

characterised in that the second shaft section has a
diameter which is less than the outer diameter of the

glue well shaft section; and in that the glue well
shaft section has a length which is at least 3/4 of

the outer diameter of that section such that softened
glue resulting from trimming operations re-hardens in

the glue well and is kept from contacting said ball-bearing
guide assembly.
A cutting tool as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that said glue well shaft section

(21) has a length which is between 3/4 of the
dimension of said outer diameter of said glue well

shaft section (21) and equal to the dimension of said
outer diameter of said glue well shaft section (21).
A cutting tool as claimed in claim 1 or
claim 2 further comprising a washer (24) accommodated

on said second shaft section (23) for further
inhibiting softened glue resulting from trimming

operations from contacting said ball-bearing guide
assembly (22). 
A cutting tool as claimed in claim 3,
characterised in that said washer has an outer

diameter that is slightly less than the outer diameter
of said ball-bearing guide assembly (22).
A cutting tool as claimed in any of claims 1
to 4 further comprising a fastener (26) being held in

a void in said second shaft (23) thereby maintaining
the accommodation of said ball-bearing assembly (22)

on said second shaft section (23).
