<ABSTRACT>
Aromatic compounds such as ethylbenzene and styrene are produced by contacting butadiene or 4-vinylcyclohexene in a flow reactor with a magnesium oxide, zinc oxide, calcium oxide, strontium oxide, or barium oxide. The products of the process contain low levels of xylene.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DEHYDROCYCLIZATION OF UNSATURATED HYDROCARBONS TO AROMATIC PRODUCTSBackground of the Invention The present invention relates to methods for converting butadiene to aromatic compounds.Ethylbenzene is an important commercial solvent and a precursor to styrene. Styrene is a major commercial chemical which finds its principal use in the manufacture of polymers such as polystyrene. Typically, styrene is formed by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. Both ethylbenzene and styrene may be produced by catalytic dehydrocyclization of 4-vinylcyclohexene ("VCH") by use of various known catalysts. Two-step processes for producing styrene and ethylbenzene are also known wherein butadiene is dimerized to form VCH and the VCH is then catalytically aromatized.However, the prior art lacks methods of producing styrene and ethylbenzene directly from butadiene. Methods for the aromatization of VCH, moreover, have been plagued with poor yields and large amounts of by-products such as xylene with are extremely difficult to separate from the desired products.For example, Suzuka et al. sealed magnesium oxide and butadiene in a quartz reactor at 200°C for 17 hours to produce ethylbenzene in a yield of about 17 percent. Applied Catalysis, Vol. 47, L7-L8 (1989). However, the major product of the reaction was o-xylene in a yield of about 54 percent.What is needed are new, more selective and effective processes for the production of aromatics such as ethylbenzene and styrene which alleviate problems in the prior art. What is also needed is a process to produce aromatics directly from butadiene thereby offering a new method of producing the aromatics in one step. Summary of InventionThis invention, in one respect, is a process to produce ethylbenzene or styrene or mixtures thereof which comprises contacting a moving feedstream containing butadiene or 4-vinylcyclohexene or both with a catalyst in the gas phase under conditions effective to convert at least a portion of the butadiene or 4-vinylcyclohexene or both to ethylbenzene or styrene or mixtures thereof, wherein the catalyst is selected from the group consisting of magnesium oxide, zinc oxide, calcium oxide, strontium oxide, and barium oxide, and wherein the products contain less than 5 mole percent of xylene.Thus, it has been found that butadiene can be converted to aromatic products such as ethylbenzene and styrene by catalytic aromatization in the presence of certain catalysts. The products formed therefrom have low amounts of by-products and are produced in high yield and
