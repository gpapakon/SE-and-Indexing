<ABSTRACT>
An intrusion detector consisting of a housing (1), a movement sensor and an evaluation circuit, whose housing lid (2) contains a locking device (4) with an opening (5). When the locking device (4) is operated, the housing lid (2) is firmly connected to or released from the housing base (3). The opening (5) is moved in such a manner, when the locking device (4) is closed, that it comes to rest over a light source (6) which is located under the housing lid (2). The light of the light source (6) enters through the opening (5) and indicates that the housing lid (2) is correctly locked to the base (3). An expanded design serves for anti-sabotage purposes in that it contains a switching element (10) which emits a disturbance signal as soon as the firm connection of the housing lid (2) with the base (3) has been released.

Intrusion detector having a movement sensor surrounded
by a housing (1) and an evaluation circuit which emits a

signal if the output signal of the movement sensor changes
in a predetermined way, the housing (1) comprising a lid

(2) and a base (3), of which the lid (2) contains an
interlocking device (4) which firmly joins the lid (2) to

the base (3), and a light source being present in the
housing interior, characterized in that the interlocking

device (4) has a movable opening (5) through which the
light source (6) disposed in the housing interior is

visible from the outside if lid (2) and base (3) are
correctly interlocked.
Intrusion detector according to Patent Claim 1,
characterized in that the interlocking device (4) is

rotatable.
Intrusion detector according to Patent Claim 1,
characterized in that the interlocking device comprises a

slider (8).
Intrusion detector according to one of Patent Claims 1
to 3, characterized in that the interlocking device (4) has

a security screw which can be undone only by means of a
matching special tool.
Intrusion detector according to one of Patent Claims 1
to 4, characterized in that the light source (6) is

disposed in a countersunk manner under the lid (2) of the
housing (1) or in a laterally displaced manner with respect

to the interlocking device (4), and in that a light guide
(9) conducts the light originating from the light source

(6) to the opening (5) in the interlocking device (4).
Intrusion detector according to one of Patent Claims 1
to 4, characterized in that the light source (6) is

disposed in a countersunk manner or a laterally displaced 
manner from the interlocking device (4) and the light

originating from the light source (6) is conducted by
mirrors, lenses or prisms to the opening (5) in the

interlocking device (4).
Intrusion detector according to one of Patent Claims 1
to 6, characterized in that a switching element (10) is

provided which triggers an alarm signal if the interlocking
device is opened.
