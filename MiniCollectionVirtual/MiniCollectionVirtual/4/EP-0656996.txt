<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control system for a 
turbine engine according to the pre-characterizing part of claim 1. In a 
control system of this kind the geometry of a variable area 
compressor is changed as a function of the compressor 
discharge pressure corresponding to a desired operational 
condition. In this control system, an operational 
differential pressure derived from the compressor discharge 
pressure acts on an actuator to develop a linear force to 
change the geometry of the variable area compressor and 
correspondingly the resulting discharge pressure. In a high performance axial flow compressor gas 
turbine engine, it is often necessary to control the mass 
air flow through the compressor to avoid characteristic 
unstable operation of the compressor particularly during an 
engine acceleration. Air flow may be controlled by bleeding 
or venting compressor stages to a suitable relatively lower 
pressure drain source such as disclosed in U.S. Patent 
3,849,021 or by varying the effective flow area of the 
compressor inlet to increase or decrease the mass air flow 
to the compressor as disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,870,956. It 
will be recognized that such bleeding of pressurized air or 
restriction of air flow to the compressor may have an 
undesirable effect on the efficiency and power of the 
engine and therefore should be limited to a minimum during 
engine operation. Various prior air compressor geometry varying means 
are disclosed in the prior art such as in U.S. Patents 
3,172,259, 3,646,753 and 3,849,021. In particular U.S. 
Patent 3,849,021 discloses a control system for a turbine 
engine having a variable geometry compressor according to 
the preamble of claim 1. These actuators are adapted to 
actuate one or more bleed valves to a fully open or closed 
position in response to selected engine operating 
parameters. Later a control was developed through which an 
input to the bleed valve was controlled by a series of  
 
incremental steps. However, even with the incremental steps 
the opening or closing of a compressor bleed valve may have 
an undesirable effect on compressor operation. It is an object of this invention to provide a 
control system for a turbine engine having a variable 
geometry air compressor which is adapted to minimize the 
undesirable effects of the bleed valve controls on the 
overall efficiency of the engine in particular to prevent 
abrupt changes in the compressor discharge pressure or 
horsepower of the turbine. According to the invention the control
