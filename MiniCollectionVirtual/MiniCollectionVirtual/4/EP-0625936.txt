<ABSTRACT>
A blast nozzle is provided for cleaning a surface with a blast media which is softer and fore friable than sand such as sodium bicarbonate and which comprises an inlet section (12) which contains a passageway which converges substantially along only one planar axis to a rectangular venturi orifice (18) and a fan-shaped outlet section (20) which contains a passageway which diverges along substantially only one planar axis perpendicular to the planar axis of convergence of the converging passageway, the inlet passageway being greater than twice the diameter of the inlet of the nozzle so as to provide streamlined flow and reduce turbulent flow of the friable blast media in the blase nozzle. The passageways in the blast nozzle are formed by opposed modular structures which are releasably secured to the nozzle and can be changed to change the length and angle of convergence and expansion ratio of the nozzle.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FAN NOZZLE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to blast nozzles and a process for removing adherent material such as paint, scale, dirt, grease and the like from solid surfaces with abrasive particles propelled by air. In particular, the present invention is directed to a novel blast nozzle which is shaped to provide uniform flow of blast media therethrough and is particularly useful in blasting with a friable and relatively soft abrasive media such as sodium bicarbonate. Description of the Prior Art In order to clean a solid surface so that such surface can again be coated such as, for example, to preserve metal against deterioration, remove graffiti from stone or simply to degrease a solid surface such as surfaces contacting food or building structures which contain food serving or food processing operations, it has become common practice to use an abrasive blasting technique wherein abrasive particles are propelled by a high pressure fluid against the solid surface in order to dislodge previously applied coatings, scale, dirt, grease or other contaminants. Various abrasive blasting techniques have been utilized to remove the coatings, grease and the like from solid surfaces. Thus, blasting techniques comprising dry blasting which involves directing the abrasive particles to a surface by means of pressurized air typically ranging from 30 to 150 psi, wet blasting in which the abrasive blast media is directed to the surface by a highly pressurized stream of water typically 3,000 psi and above, multi-step processes comprising 

dry or wet blasting and a mechanical technique such as sanding, chipping, etc. and a single step process in which both air and water are utilized either in combination at high pressures to propel the abrasive blast media to the surface as disclosed in U.S. 4,817,342, or in combination with relatively low pressure water used as a dust control agent or to control substrate damage have been used. Water for dust control has been mixed with the air either internally in the blast nozzle or at the targeted surface to be cleaned and such latter process, although primarily a dry blasting technique, is considered wet blasting inasmuch as media recovery and clean up is substantially different from that utilized in a purely dry blasting operation.A typical dry blasting apparatus as well as a wet blasting apparatus which utilizes highly pressurized air to entrain, carry and direct the abrasive blast media to the solid surface to be treated
