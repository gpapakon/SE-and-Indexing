<ABSTRACT>
Acid catalyst compositions comprise a silica or zirconium 
hydroxide support, a Group VIII metal, and a heteropolyacid selected 

from a partially exchanged aluminum salt of 12-tungstophosphoric acid 
and a partially exchanged aluminum salt of 12-tungstosilicic acid and 

mixtures thereof; and also, when the support is silica, from 
12-tungstophosphoric acid and/or 12-tungstosilicic acid. The use of 

the catalysts in a hydrocarbons isomerization process reduces 
cracking.

<DESCRIPTION>
The increasing emphasis on obtaining high octane non-aromatic 
fuel molecules has increased the search for environmentally compatible 
solid acid catalysts, primarily oxides, for use in such processes 
as paraffin isomerization and alkylation. In the area of paraffin 
isomerization, the solid acid catalyst should provide good activity at 
low temperature since thermodynamic equilibrium generally favors 
multibranched isomers, with high octane value, at lower temperature. 
In addition to maximizing product branching it is important to limit 
the amount of competing reactions, predominantly cracking, during 
isomerization. These cracking reactions are particularly problematic 
for acyclic paraffin feed molecules C₇+ or larger. The most commonly used catalysts in n-paraffin (C₅ and C₆) 
isomerization include Pt supported on zeolites such as mordenite, or 
on highly chlorided aluminas which in the presence of continuous 
chlorine addition to the feed exist as aluminum trichloride supported 
on alumina. What is needed in the art is an oxide based catalyst that 
can isomerize n-paraffins at low temperatures and in particular form 
very little cracked products with C₇+ feeds. Furthermore, such 
catalysts would alleviate the environmental concerns associated with 
the inconvenient, environmentally detrimental chlorine addition 
required during operating aluminum chloride based isomerization 
catalysts. The supported heteropolyacid catalysts of the present 
invention catalyze the isomerization of n-paraffins, such as heptane, 
at temperatures comparable to those found using Pt-containing acidic 
zeolites such as mordenite or using strong acids based on or related 
to sulfated zirconia (ZrO₂/SO₄). Unexpectedly, the amount of cracking 
of C₇+ paraffins is substantially reduced.  The present invention is directed to novel catalyst compositions, 
their preparation, and their use in a selective paraffin 
isomerization process. The present invention is directed to novel 
solid acid catalyst compositions comprising a support of silica or 
zirconium hydroxide, from 0.01 to 60 wt.% of a Group VIII metal and a 
heteropolyacid selected from an exchanged aluminum salt of 12-tungstophosphoric 
acid, an exchanged aluminum salt of 12-tungstosilicic acid, 
and mixtures thereof and additionally from 12-tungstophosphoric acid 
and/or 12-tungstosilicic acid when the support is silica. The use of said catalysts in an isomerization process 
comprises contacting said catalysts with a feed comprising Cn or Cn+ 
paraffins, wherein n=4.
