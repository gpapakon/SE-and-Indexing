<ABSTRACT>
A wide-band microwave modulator arrangement for an information 
transmission system, such as a video signal distribution system, in which signals from 

a microwave carrier signal source are split and directed over a first path comprising 
an attenuator and a second path comprising phase shift means and a balanced 

modulator, the output signals from the two paths being combined for transmission. 
Signals from the carrier signal source may also be directed over a third path including 

phase shift means and a second balanced modulator, amplified output signals from the 
first two paths being combined with output signals from this third path before 

transmission.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to wide-band microwave modulator arrangements. According to the present invention a wide-band microwave modulator 
arrangement comprises a microwave carrier signal source, means to direct signals from 
said source over a first path including attenuator means and over a second path 
including phase shift means and a balanced modulator arrangement to which wide-band 
modulation signals are arranged to be supplied, and means to combine signals 
from the outputs of said first and second paths for transmission. A video signal distribution system incorporating a wide-band microwave 
modulator arrangement in accordance with the present invention will now be described 
by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which:- 
Figure 1 shows schematically a transmitter station of the system, Figure 2 shows schematically in more detail one form of the up convertor or 
modulator of Figure 1, Figure 3 shows schematically in more detail a second form of the up convertor 
or modulator of Figure 1, Figure 4 shows schematically a receiver station of the system, Figure 5 shows schematically a return path transmitter of the system, and Figures 6 and 7 illustrate diagrammatically range/loss characteristics of the 
system. Referring first to Figure 1, the first part of the transmitter consists of a source 
1 of millimetre wave power sufficient to drive the modulator/upconverter. This may 
be a stabilised GUNN oscillator, synthesised source or any convenient method known 
to the art with stability and spectral purity adequate for the application. The source  
 
is to be provided with an electronic tuning port capable of frequency shift modulation 
up to the rate necessary for the return path application. The output of the source is 
taken via a low pass filter 2 (Figure 2) to limit the level of even order harmonics of 
the source frequency applied to the modulator. The modulator is shown in Figure 2. The input signal is split into two paths 
by means of a -3dB, 180o hybrid coupler 3. The carrier reference path 4 is fed via 
a microwave isolator 5 to the input port of a second reversed -3dB, 180o coupler 6. 
The modulation path 7 takes the output from the second port of the coupler 3 and 
feeds this signal via a phase shifter 8 and a level set attenuator 9 to the balanced 
modulator 10. The modulator match is isolated from the modulation path 7 by means 
of microwave isolators 11 and 12 on its input and output ports. The modulation port 
of the modulator 10 is fed with the
