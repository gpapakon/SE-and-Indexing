<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for steam heating material, preferably cellulose pulp, which flows through a conveying pipe (1). The steam is supplied through a number of steam pipes (4), which are connected to fittings (2), which are attached in a helical curve on the conveying pipe (1) so that they together extend about the entire circumference of the pipe (1). In every fitting (2) along its length a plurality of inlet holes (3) for the steam are arranged through the wall of the conveying pipe (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an arrangement for heating 
material in a conveying pipe. The material consists preferably 
of fibre material in the form of cellulose pulp, and the 
heating medium is steam. In a cellulose process it is necessary in many places 
to heat the pulp, for example in order to cause different 
chemical reactions and treatments to start and to continue. 
This applies, for example, in many bleaching steps. In order to 
ensure this heating, steam of different pressures is used, 
depending on the pressure level required by the process in the 
installation in question. The heating of the pulp with steam preferably takes 
place in a pulp conveying pipe to the treatment step in 
question. The pulp concentration can be 3-20% and preferably 
5-15%. Hereby a relatively rapid and uniform heating can be 
achieved. The steam normally is supplied through one or several 
steam pipes connected to the pulp pipe. Such so-called steam 
extension pipes to the pipe system can be designed in different 
ways, whereby the result concerning temperature increase of the 
pulp can vary and the functioning of subsequent machines will 
be more or less good. In earlier used systems/arrangements problems have 
often arisen with large steam bubbles developing on the inside 
of the pulp pipe. When these steam bubbles condense rapidly, 
condensate bangs occur which cause harmful cavitations in the 
pipe system and surrounding components. It is difficult, 
furthermore, to achieve an entirely uniform temperature profile 
in the pulp. It is certainly possible to improve the 
temperature profile by inserting the steam pipes into the pulp 
pipe, but this implies very much deteriorated flow in the pulp 
pipe and also difficulties in cleaning the pulp pipe and steam 
pipes in cases of plugging. The aforesaid problems are solved by the present 
invention. Due to it, the steam heating can take place 
effectively and uniformly in that the steam is exposed to a 
large volume/surface of the passing pulp flow. The steam, 
furthermore, is supplied without any condensate bangs and  
 
without objecting the pulp flow. The arrangement according to 
the invention, besides, is designed so that it can be cleaned 
easily when plugging of pulp occurs. The characterizing features of the invention are 
apparent from the claims. The invention is described in greater detail in the 
following, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in 
which:
