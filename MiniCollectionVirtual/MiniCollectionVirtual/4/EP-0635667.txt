J launching technique, comprising joining together mixed-structure 

pipes consisting of a steel core reinforced with a composite 
material consisting of a hardenable material containing continuous 

fibres and in which: 

the continuous fibre is wound about the steel core as a 
helical winding which forms an angle of between 65 and 87° with 

the pipe axis;

thickness of the steel core is between 2 and 8;

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for laying underwater pipelines 
in deep water. More particularly, the invention relates to a method for laying 
underwater pipelines, intended for conveying fluids and in 
particular natural gas or crude oil, on sea beds of depth 
exceeding 1000 metres and generally between 3000 and 4000 metres. The laying of underwater pipelines for gas or hydrocarbon 
transportation through relatively long sea distances is a practice 
which has existed for some years. Up to the present time such pipelines have been laid on sea beds 
at a maximum depth of about 600-700 metres in the case of very 
long large-diameter pipelines (trunk lines) used for transporting 
products from their place of production to their place of 
consumption, or on sea beds of 1000-1500 metres depth in the case 
of short small-diameter pipelines (flow lines) used for 
transportation from off-shore wells to production structures. Trunk lines are of steel construction covered with plastics 
materials, for example with thermoplastic resins such as 
polyethylene or with epoxy, polyurethane or other resins, possibly 
fibre-reinforced, for protection against corrosion and abrasion.  
 In the case of the shallowest sea beds this covering is further 
covered with a layer of cement, possibly reinforced with a metal 
mesh or artificial fibres, having the main purpose of providing 
additional weight and the secondary purpose of providing 
mechanical protection. With regard to the laying method, trunk lines are currently almost 
exclusively laid by dedicated ships. Specifically, the trunk 
lines are prepared by welding together covered pipes or pipe 
pieces of about 12-24 metres launched from the ship as essentially 
horizontal lines, maintaining them in tension by suitable 
movements of the ship. By operating horizontally it is possible 
to work continuously because a number of welding stations can be 
positioned along the ship. This launching system is known as S launching because before it 
becomes deposited on the sea bed the pipe assumes a double 
curvature of S shape. A modification of this method is to weld together prefabricated 
pipe pieces of greater length (about 50-70 m) along a launching 
slip of variable inclination but close to vertical, so that the 
pipe forms a single J-shaped curve before it becomes deposited on 
the sea bed (J launching). The advantage of J launching over S launching is that the tensions 
applied to the pipeline are considerably less than those of S 
launching, except in the case of

A method for laying underwater pipelines in deep water, 
using the J launching technique, comprising joining together 

mixed-structure pipes consisting of a steel core reinforced with a 
composite material layer comprising a matrix containing continuous

the continuous fibre is wound about the steel core as a 
helical winding which forms an angle of between 65 and 87° with 

the pipe axis; 
the ratio of the thickness of the composite material layer to the 
thickness of the steel core is between 2 and 8;

the steel core is between 20 and 30 mm. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the matrix 
material consists of a thermosetting resin, a thermoplastic resin 

or cement. 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the reinforcement fibres for the composite material are 

glass fibres, aramidic fibres (KEVLAR), carbon fibres, boron 
fibres, or high modulus polyethylene fibres. 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the continuous fibres are helically wound over the entire 

length of the steel core with the exception of its ends, which are 
left free for a distance of 50-100 mm. 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

ii) restoring the physical continuity of the composite material 
of the mixed-structure pipes by superposing two prefabricated 

half-rings of composite material reinforced with long or
