<ABSTRACT>
In a method for carrying out a wirefree data exchange between a fixed station (3) and transmitting/receiving devices (2, 2') on board objects which move relative to the fixed station (3), preferably in lanes (4), in particular vehicles (1), with the aid of an antenna arrangement having a plurality of receiving antennas (5) whose receiving profiles can be directed electronically at an object, the transmitting/receiving devices (2, 2'), in response to a received signal, emitting a response signal which is at the same carrier frequency and whose level is proportional to the level of the received signal, a less selective setting of the receiving profile - and thus a reduction in the complexity associated therewith - is possible due to the fact that each receiving antenna (7) is assigned a transmitting antenna (6) and that the transmitting antenna (6) emits signals which have a transmitting profile corresponding to the receiving profile of the receiving antenna (7). The attenuation factors of transmitting profile and receiving profile are in this case multiplied together so that two relatively simple circuits are required in order to achieve the desired high sidelobe attenuation.

Method for carrying out wireless data exchange
between a fixed station (3) and transceiving units (2,

2') on board objects, in particular vehicles (1) moving
relative to the fixed station (3), preferably in lanes

(4), with the aid of an antenna arrangement having a
plurality of antennas (5) whose receiving profiles can be

aligned electronically with an object, the transceiving
units (2, 2') emitting in response to a received signal

a response signal which has the same carrier frequency
and whose level is proportional to the level of the

received signal, characterized in that an antenna (5)
comprises a receiving antenna part (7) and a transmitting

antenna part (6) assigned thereto, and in that the
transmitting antenna (6) emits signals with a transmitting

profile corresponding to the receiving profile of
the receiving antenna (7).
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that neighbouring transmitting antennas (6, 6') emit

signals at different carrier frequencies, and in that
only signals at the frequency of the assigned transmitting

antenna (6, 6') are relayed for evaluation from the
associated receiving antennas (7, 7').
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that four different frequencies are used.
Device for carrying out the method according to
one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that in the fixed

station (3) each receiving antenna (7) is assigned a 
transmitting antenna (6) and the receiving antennas (7)

and transmitting antennas (6) in each case have a beam-shaping
network (9, 14).
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in
that mutually assigned transmitting and receiving

antennas (6, 7) are arranged in direct spatial proximity,
and in that the beam-shaping networks (9, 14) of the

mutually assigned antennas (6, 7) are controlled by the
same processor (12).
Device according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized
by carrier frequency generators for neighbouring transmitting

antennas (6, 6') which operate at different
frequencies.
