An integrated structure protection circuit suitable for 
protecting a power device (M) against overvoltages comprises a 

plurality of serially connected junction diodes (D1-D5), each 
having a first electrode, represented by a highly doped region 

(1) of a first conductivity type, and a second electrode 
represented by a medium doped or low doped region (2) of a 

second conductivity type. A first diode (D1) of said plurality 
has its first electrode (1) connected to a gate layer (5) of 

said power device (M) and its second electrode (2) connected to 
the second electrode (2) of at least one second diode (D2-D5) 

of said plurality, and said at least one second diode has its 
first electrode (1) connected to a drain region of the power 

device (M). The doping level of the second electrode (2) of the 
diodes (D1-D5) of said plurality is suitable to achieve 

sufficiently high breakdown voltage values.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an integrated structure
circuit for the protection of power devices, particularly
MOSFETs and IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors), against
overvoltages.Power MOSFETs and IGBTs are frequently employed to drive an
inductive load, such as an ignition coil.Due to the type of load, overvoltages appear across the
device when it is switched off; said overvoltages can be very
high and cause the device, which still drains the nominal
current for a short time interval after it has been switched
off, to be hardly stressed. Moreover, high overvoltages can
lead to the breakdown of the device, and to its permanent
damage if it is not able to dissipate the energy stored in the
inductive load.To prevent such problems, power devices are generally
protected with an external clamping diode having a breakdown
voltage lower than that of the device to be protected. Stray
inductances and operating times of the protection device,
however, limit the effectiveness of such protections.In order to overcome such limits, the manufacturers of power
MOS devices have developed integrated structure protection
circuits, called "active clamps", comprising a resistive
element, connected in series between an external gate electrode
and the gate of the power device, and a clamping element
between the gate and the drain of power device. When the power
device is switched off, overvoltages give rise to a voltage 
drop across the terminals of the clamping element; if said
voltage drop exceeds the breakdown voltage of the clamping
element, current will flow through it and the resistive
element, between the drain of the power device and the gate
electrode. As soon as the voltage drop across the resistive
element exceeds the turn-on voltage of the power device (which,
in the case of power MOSFETs is represented by the threshold
voltage), this will turn-on again and start draining current;
thus the current that must be sustained by the active clamp is
very low. Overvoltages across the power device will be clamped
to a maximum value (Vc lamp) represented by the sum of the
breakdown voltage of the clamping element and the turn-on
voltage necessary to sustain the current flowing through the
power device itself.It should be understood that a simple diode, whose anode and
cathode are respectively connected to the gate and to the drain
of a n-channel power MOSFET, is not suitable, since when the
power MOSFET is in the on state said diode would be forward
biased, and the current flowing from the gate to the drain
thro
