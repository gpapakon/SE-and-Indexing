<ABSTRACT>
An improved manufacturing procedure for 
the preparation and isolation of cyclopropylnitrile 

is provided. 4-Halobutyronitrile is reacted with 
an alkali metal base in the presence of an aprotic 

polar solvent, an inorganic salt and a catalytic 
amount of water at an elevated temperature. The 

reaction product cyclopropylnitrile is isolated by 
azeotropic distillation.

<DESCRIPTION>
Cyclopropylnitrile is a vital raw 
material in the manufacture of herbicidal agents. 
It is particularly useful in the manufacture of 
herbicidally potent, yet environmentally benign 1-(o-cyclopropylcarbonyl)-phenylsulfamoyl 
urea 
derivatives. The preparation of cyclopropylnitrile 
from 4-chlorobutyronitrile is described in U. S. 
3,843,709. However, when this preparation is 
applied to a manufacturing scale, an unstirrable 
mass forms causing decreased reaction yield, broken 
or damaged equipment and problematic product 
isolation. Therefore it is an object of this 
invention to provide an improved process for the 
manufacture of cyclopropylnitrile which is suitable 
for large scale production with increased isolated 
product yield. It is another object of this invention to 
provide an efficient and effective method of 
isolation of cyclopropylnitrile in high purity and 
with essentially no water content. It is a further object of this invention 
to provide a convenient and economic source of 
essential starting material in the production of 
herbicidal sulfamoyl urea derivatives. Herbicidal agents and in particular 1-(o-cyclopropylcarbonyl)phenylsulfamoyl 
urea 
derivatives are prepared using cyclopropylnitrile  
 
as the basic starting material. It has now been 
found that cyclopropylnitrile can be prepared on a 
commercial manufacturing scale without the 
formation of an unstirrable mass and accompanying 
equipment damage or breakage and decreased product 
yield by reacting 4-halobutyronitrile with an 
alkali metal base in the presence of an aprotic 
polar solvent, an inorganic salt and a catalytic 
amount of water at a temperature of about 50°-100°C. 
The preparation is shown in flow diagram I 
wherein X is halogen, M is an alkali metal and R is 
hydrogen or C1-C6alkyl. Methods available in the art to prepare 
cyclopropylnitrile, upon scale-up, give the 
formation of an unstirrable mass. The inability to 
stir or agitate a reaction mixture results in 
incomplete reaction, hazardous reaction conditions 
and damaged or broken equipment. Surprisingly, it 
has been found that the addition of at least 0.25 
mole, preferably about 0.4 to 1.5 mole and more 
preferably about 0.5 to 1.0 mole of an inorganic 
salt eliminates the formation of an unstirrable 
mass thus preventing agitation problems, poor 
yields and a broken or damaged agitator. Advantageously, 
it has been found that the addition of a 
catalytic amount of water to the reaction mixture 
is critical to the initiation of the reaction.
