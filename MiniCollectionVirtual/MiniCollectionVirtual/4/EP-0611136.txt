<ABSTRACT>
A tape storage apparatus (10) is used with a mailing machine (14) for 
printing postage indicia on a discrete portion of a strip of tape 

of indefinite length. This is fed along a tape path extending 
through the mailing machine (14) by tape feeding means mounted within 

the mailing machine (14). The tape storage apparatus (10) includes a base 
(30) having vertical guide rails (40) and a tape holding device (44) 

mounted on the guide rails (40) for movement therealong. A releasable 
latching means (72),(74) holds the tape holding device (44) in a 

lowermost position against the force of a plurality of resilient 
spring device 55 for moving the tape holding means (44) upwardly. In 

this upward position, the tape holding device (44) becomes accessible 
to an operator or service person for reloading rolls of tape or 

performing service on the apparatus (10). When the tape holding 
device (44) is in its lowermost position, it is functionally 

integrated with the mailing machine (14), but it is inaccessible for 
reloading tape or for threading tape into the feeding means in 

the mailing machine (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus for 
storing tape which is fed to a printing apparatus, and more 
particularly to a tape storage apparatus for use in a mailing 
machine in which tape is selectively moved to and from a printing 
position in which postage indicia is printed on the tape when the 
mailing machine is not printing the postage indicia on discrete 
envelopes. Modern day mailing machines, such as that shown and 
described in U.S. patents 4,876,956 and 4,922,085 have evolved 
into highly, multi-functional machines capable of processing a 
plurality of mail pieces of different types through the steps 
required to affix proper postage to them for handling by the U. 
S. Postal Service. For example, the mailing machine just 
mentioned can store a plurality of mail pieces in a hopper, 
successively feed them seriatim to a weighing module which 
electronically determines the amount or postage required for each 
mail piece, print that amount of postage as an indicia either 
directly on the mail piece if it is relatively thin, such as a 
typical letter envelope or on a strip of tape which is applied to 
the envelope if it is too thick to feed through the printing 
mechanism, and finally deposit mail pieces in an orderly fashion 
in any of a variety of stacking devices for retrieval and further 
handling by Postal Service representatives. It should also be 
noted that the foregoing process occurs at a high speed, 
usually in the order of 2 per second if weighing each piece is 
involved, 4 per second if weighing is not involved. Thus, it 
will be apparent that to accomplish this process at the indicated 
speed, the mailing machine requires a great number of mechanical 
parts which must fit together accurately and operate smoothly, 
and a highly complex electronic control system including various 
operator controlled devices and modules for setting up and 
operating the mailing machine, microprocessors for controlling  
 
the synchronous operation of various components and devices, and 
diagnostic systems for detecting various malfunctions and 
providing appropriate indication thereof. One of the requirements of the mailing machine under 
consideration is that of providing a continuous supply of tape on 
which the postage indicia is printed when tape printing is the 
selected mode of operation. Since the mailing machine operates 
at a high speed in terms of the number of mail pieces 
processed as mentioned above, it is necessary to have a large 
supply of tape available in order to

upwardly from said base, 
means mounting said tape holding means for movement along 
said guide means (36) between a lowermost position in which said

and an uppermost position in which said tape holding means 

becomes accessible for replacement of a roll of tape and for 
threading the tape along said tape path and into the 

entrance to the tape path in the mailing machine, 
releasable latching means (78) for normally latching said tape 
holding means in said lowermost position, and 
means (55) for moving said tape holding means upwardly toward 
said uppermost position when said latching means is 

released, whereby said tape holding means is normally 
maintained in a position in which the tape roll is 

situated for feeding tape along said tape path in said tape 
holding means and into the tape path extending through the 

mailing machine and can be moved to a position in which the 
tape roll becomes accessible for replacement of the tape 

roll and for threading of tape along said tape path in said 
tape holding means into the tape path extending through the
