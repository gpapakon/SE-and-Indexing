<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a door control device comprising a 
hollow housing defining a chamber and a piston disposed in the chamber and 
movable relative to the housing along a rectilinear path. It is known to incorporate in the piston of a device of the kind 
described a seal which engages the housing in sliding contact to seal the interface 
between the piston and the housing. An example of a door control device 
incorporating a piston is disclosed in GB 2 230 050A and an example of a piston 
incorporating a seal which is a snap-fit in a body of the piston is disclosed in 
GB 2 248 905A. According to a first aspect of the present invention, the piston of a 
door control device of the kind described comprises a seal which engages the 
housing in sliding contact therewith to seal the interface between the piston and 
the housing and also seals an aperture in the piston when the piston is subjected 
to hydraulic pressure acting in a first direction along the path of travel of the 
piston. The seal of a device embodying the first aspect of the invention 
performs two functions which, in the arrangements described in the aforesaid 
published applications were performed by two separate components. According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a door 
control device of the kind described wherein the piston includes a body and a seal 
mounted on the body, wherein a peripheral portion of the seal is in sliding 
contact with the housing to seal the interface between the piston and the housing, 
the body of the piston defines a valve seat, a further portion of the seal bears on 
the valve seat and wherein the further portion of the seal is flexible relative to the 
seat and is able to flex away from the seat when subjected to hydraulic pressure 
acting in one direction along the path of travel of the piston. The further portion of the seal may define an aperture through which 
fluid can flow when the further portion flexes away from the seat.  According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a door 
control device of the kind described wherein the piston includes a body and a seal 
carried on the body, the seal is in sliding contact with the housing to seal the 
interface between the housing and the piston, the seal includes a tubular portion 
spaced from the housing, an elongated flow control element extends into the 
piston through the tubular portion of the seal, the tubular portion of the seal is 
in sliding contact with the flow control element and wherein the

A door control device comprising a hollow housing (10) defining a 
chamber and a piston (12) disposed in the chamber and being movable relative 

to the housing along a rectilinear path, wherein the piston comprises a seal (21) 
which engages the housing in sliding contact therewith to seal the interface 

between the piston characterised in that the seal also seals an aperture (29) in the 
piston when the piston is subjected to hydraulic pressure acting in a first direction 

along the path of travel of the piston. 
A device according to Claim 1 wherein the piston comprises a body 
(20) having a face which is transverse to said path, the seal has a relatively 

flexible portion (26) overlapping said face, the face provides a seat for the flexible 
portion of the seal and said portion can flex away from the seat when subjected 

to hydraulic pressure acting in a second direction along said path. 
A device according to Claim 2 wherein the body (20) of the piston 
defines said aperture in the piston and said flexible portion (26) of the seal 

defines an aperture (30) which is offset from the aperture (29) in the body. 
A device according to Claim 2 or Claim 3 wherein the seal (21) is a 
snap-fit on the body (20), each of the seal and the body has the form of a cup and 

wherein the seat is at a bottom of the cup which forms the body. 
A device according to any preceding claim wherein an elongated flow 
control element (32) extends into the piston through the seal (21), the seal has a 

tubular portion (33) embracing the flow control element and the tubular portion 
is resiliently flexible relative to the flow control element. 
A device according to Claim 5 wherein the tubular portion (33) has an 
internal surface which is cylindrical along a part of the length of the tubular 

portion and which is part-cylindrical along a further part of the length of the 
tubular portion. 
A device according to Claim 5 or Claim 6, as appendant to Claim 2, 
wherein the tubular portion (33) is connected with a circumferential portion (25) 

of the seal only by said relatively flexible portion (26). 
A device according to any preceding claim wherein the seal (21) 
carries a valve element (37) and a spring (38) urging the valve element in a 

direction transverse to the path of movement of the piston onto a seat (36) 
defined by the seal. 
A door control device comprising a hollow housing (10) defining a 
chamber and a piston (12) disposed in the chamber, the piston being movable 

relative to the housing along a rectilinear path, wherein the piston includes a body 
(20) and a seal (21) carried on the body, the seal is in sliding engagement with 

the housing to seal the interface between the piston and the housing, the seal 
includes a tubular portion (33) spaced from the housing, an elongated flow 

control element (32) extends into the piston through the tubular portion of the 
seal, the tubular portion is in sliding contact with the flow control element and 

wherein the tubular portion is more flexible than the flow control element and is 
thereby adapted to be driven into pressure contact with the flow control element 

by hydraulic pressure exerted on the outside of the tubular portion. 
A door control device comprising a hollow housing (10) defining a 
chamber and a piston (12) disposed in the chamber, the piston being movable 

relative to the housing along a rectilinear path, wherein the piston includes a body 
(20) and a seal (21) mounted on the body, a peripheral portion (25) of the seal 

 
is in sliding contact with the housing to seal the interface between the piston and 

the housing, the body of the piston defines a valve seat, a further portion (26) of 
the seal bears on the valve seat and wherein the further portion of the seal is 

flexible relative to the seat and is able to flex away from the seat when subjected 
to hydraulic pressure acting in one direction along said path. 
A device according to Claim 10 wherein the seal comprises a 
peripheral wall (25) and a transverse wall (26) and wherein the seal defines an 

aperture (30) in the transverse wall of the seal. 
A device according to Claim 10 or Claim 11 wherein the seal carries 
a relief valve (36, 37, 38). 
A device according to Claim 11 wherein the transverse wall (26)
