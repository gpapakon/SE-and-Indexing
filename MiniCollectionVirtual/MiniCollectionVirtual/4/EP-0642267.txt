<ABSTRACT>
A television apparatus (50) comprises a video display (16) 
having a first vertical display height and a first format display ratio 

(e.g. 16:9). A first video processor (56) combines video signals 
(VIDEO 1, VIDEO 2) representative of at least two pictures for side by 

side display of the pictures on the video display, each of the pictures 
having a second format display ratio (e.g. 8:9) smaller than 

approximately 4:3. A vertical height control (86, 88) decreases the 
vertical display height smaller than the first vertical display height 

during the side by side display of said pictures, each of the side by 
side pictures thereby having a third format display (e g. 8:7) between 

the first and second format display ratios. The first, or a second, 
video processor horizontally compresses each of the pictures to 

correct for any image aspect ratio distortion due to decreasing the 
vertical deflection height.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to simultaneous multiple picture displays,
and in particular concerns an improved display format for two side by
side pictures on televisions, both wide screen and conventional, with
correct image aspect ratio and without substantial cropping.In the following discussion, the terminology "format display ratio"
refers to the ratio of the width to height of the borders of a picture or
display means. The format display ratio of the video display means for a
conventional television apparatus, for example, is 4:3. Such numerical
ratios are also expressed as 4 X 3, and both formats for expressing
ratios may be used herein. The terminology "image aspect ratio" refers
to the ratio of the width to the height of images constituting a picture,
without regard to the borders or dimensions of the overall picture.
Images constituting a picture will have a correct image aspect ratio if
such pictures are not distorted by disproportionate compression or
expansion of horizontal and vertical dimensions. This distinction is
important because two pictures can have the same format display ratio,
but different image aspect ratios, and vice versa.Documents WO-A-91 19395 and WO-A-91 19384 disclose a wide
screen television apparatus for processing multiple video signals to
generate a plurality of multiple picture display formats, including among
others, two side by side pictures, each of which fills 1/2 of the area of
the wide screen video display means. The format display ratio of the
video display means for the wide screen television apparatus disclosed
in WO-A-91 19395 is 16:9, also expressed as 16 X 9.Side by side pictures are an appealing feature for a television
apparatus, especially one having a wide screen display. One can watch
two programs simultaneously, with equal size pictures. This can be
significantly more pleasing than a picture-in picture format, wherein a
second picture overlays a main picture, and is quite small in display area
by comparison to the main picture. Side by side displays provide two
main pictures. However, side by side picture 
display formats can present a problem, even on a wide screen
display, because significant amounts of subject matter must be
cropped in order to avoid image aspect ratio distortion. If a wide
screen television has such video display means with a format
display ratio of approximately 16:9, for example, each of the side by
side pictures displayed thereon will have a format display ratio of
approximately 8:9. If the picture sources have a conventional

<CLAIMS>
A television apparatus comprising :

video display means (16) having a first vertical display height and
a first format display ratio (e.g. 16:9) greater than 4:3; and
means (56) for combining video signals (VIDEO 1, VIDEO 2)
representative of at least two pictures (28,30) for side by side display of said

pictures on said video display means (16), each of said pictures having a

second effective format display ratio (e.g. 8:9) smaller than 4:3;

characterised by means (86,88) for decreasing the vertical display
height of said pictures to be smaller than said first vertical display height

during said side by side display of said pictures, each of said side by side
pictures (32,34) thereby having a third effective format display ratio (e.g.

8:7) between said first (e.g. 16:9) and second (e.g. 8:9) format display ratios.
The television apparatus of claim 1, further characterised by
means (56) for horizontally compressing each of said pictures (32,34 ;

38,40) to compensate for any image aspect ratio distortion incurred by
decreasing said vertical display height.
The television apparatus of claim 1, characterised in that said
first format display ratio (e.g. 16:9) is a wide format display ratio.
The television apparatus of claim 3, characterised in that said
first format display ratio is substantially equal to 16:9, said second format

display ratio is substantially equal to 8:9 and said third format display ratio is
substantially equal to 8:7.
The television apparatus of claim 1, characterised in that said
vertical display height is decreased by a certain factor (e.g. 7/9) and said

pictures are horizontally compressed by said same certain factor. 
The television apparatus of claim 1 , characterised in that said
vertical display height is decreased by a first factor (e;g. 7/9) and said

pictures are horizontally compressed by a second factor larger than said first
factor to further reduce cropping of said pictures notwithstanding some

image aspect ratio distortion.
A television apparatus, comprising :

video display means (16) having a first vertical display height and a first
format display ratio (e;g. 4:3 or 16:9) ;and
means (56) for horizontally cropping a certain portion (24,26) of
subject matter from video signals representative (VIDEO1 , VIDEO2) of at

least two pictures (28,30) and for combining said video signals for side by
side display of said cropped pictures on said video display means, said side

by side pictures filling a first given area of said video display means ;

characterised by means for decreasing the vertical display height of
said pictures to be smaller than said first vertical display height during said

side by side display of said pictures, said side by side pictures (32,34)
thereby filling a second area of said video display means smaller than said

first given area but having a smaller portion (24',26') than said certain
portion (24,26) cropped therefrom.
The television apparatus of claim 7, further characterised by
means (56) for horizontally compressing each of said pictures (32,34 ;
