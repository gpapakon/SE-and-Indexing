<ABSTRACT>
The conveyor consists of a double-start helical gear (1) 
made to rotate by a transmission at its motorized support: 

the hook (3) is supported on the base (5) and pushed along 
by the flanks (4) of the thread; a toothed section (11) 

couples with a cog belt (9) over whose reverse side (10) 
the hook slides in crossing the said toothed section (11). 

The continuous helical gear is supported by cradles (6) 
that have an encircling angle greater than 180Â°. A flexible 

helical gear is also envisaged, enabling it to follow 
curved paths, with analogously sized external thread but 

having an internal helical groove (35), protruding through 
the base (5) of the thread. The conveyor is particularly 

suitable for conveying and storing suspended items.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a continuous helical gear conveyor
for conveying and storing suspended objects, that is, a
device that, whilst keeping the objects suspended, conveys
them or keeps them in storage by means of a helical gear
and is particularly suitable for suspended confections.The prior art involves helical gear devices, both for just
conveying the suspended items and for conveying and supporting
the suspended items, of limited lengths and with
devices to prevent the operator's fingers and hair from
getting caught in the mechanism.Prior art, also, involves in the patent DE 1214611 helical
gear devices with curved stretches of limited length and
short curvature radius. The flexible stretches are made
by one internal spiralform spring with many starts and one
external wound in opposite direction. The internal spring
is rigidly connected to the helical gear at each ends and
the external one is the same wound in the rigid helical
gear stretches before and after flexible stretch.As result the kown type of flexible helical gear do not
work well to high turn speed: the objects are twisted rapidly
from the two straight stretches and may oscillate to
drop from the helical gear. The mechanical charge of its
own weight and of weight of objects do not permit to made
long curved path, so the only curve permitted is with
short curvature radius and thus short length of the curved
path.Such prior art may be subject to considerable improvements
with a view to eliminating the limitation on the length of
the flexible helical gear, thereby making it possible for 
it to extend distance from the two straight stretches with
also long curvature radius.From the foregoing emerges the need to solve the technical
problem of finding a flexible helical gear that may follow
whichever path that may be required, subsequently, a conformation
of flexible helical gear stretches with low
weight and, furthermore, helical gear that may be easly
dismantled and motorized.One solution to this problem is disclosed in US 2620917 where
the curved stretches of a flexible helical gear are supported in
their entirety by outer bearings.This invention follows a different way and
solves the said technical problem by adopting:
a continuous helical gear conveyor for conveying and
storing suspended objects with one flexible helical gear
stretch at least, comprising a rotating helical gear that
contains in the space between the thread and supports a
hook of the object being conveyed, and for flexible stretches
two axially coupled helixes, the

<CLAIMS>
A continuous helical gear conveyor (1, 43, 53) for conveying
and storing suspended objects with one flexible helical

gear stretch at least, comprising a rotating helical
gear that contains in the space between the thread and

supports a hook (3) of the object being conveyed, and for
flexible stretches two axially coupled helixes, the external

one with a pitch sufficient to contain and push along
the hook (3, 52) of the objects being conveyed and the internal

one, wound in the opposite direction and with external
diameter close to the internal diameter of the

first one, that provides support for the said hook and resistance
against compression for the external helix, 
characterised
in that
 the flexible helical gear (33) is guided
by an internal core (38) forming the curvature/s required

completely enclosed by the flexible helical gear, but is

positioned in space by means of the contact of the flexible
helical gear with its supports (21, 22).

in the opposite direction to the external thread (4, 5) of
the helical gear, cut to a diameter which is greater than

the minor diameter (Dn) of the external thread in the tubular
section included between the said minor diameter and

the diameter of the internal hole (Df).
A helical gear conveyor with one flexible stretch at
least, as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised

in that said internal core (38), due to the sliding
contact to the internal hole (Df ), is advantageously covered 

with a layer of low-friction material.

spaces (45) on the corresponding toothed length (54) of
continuous helical gear (53).
