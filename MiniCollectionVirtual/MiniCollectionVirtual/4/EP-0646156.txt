<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ink compositions and more particularly to 
ink compositions for printing on plain paper using an ink jet printer, 
and a method of ink jet printing on paper. The invention is 
especially concerned with compositions suitable for use as inks in 
so-called "drop-on-demand" ink jet printers. In ink jet printing, a fluid ink is forced under pressure, and 
sometimes at elevated temperature, through a very small nozzle in a 
printing head. In one kind of printer, known as a "continuous" printer, ink droplets 
which are produced continuously are passed through a charging area 
where individual droplets receive an electrical charge in response to 
a signal and are directed towards a substrate to be printed. The 
droplets pass through an electrical field causing them to be deflected 
by an amount which is dependent on the intensity of the charge and the 
field. Droplets not required to form print on the substrate are 
directed to a by-pass gutter. Inks for use in such printers need to 
be conductive.  
 In another kind of printer, known as a "drop-on-demand" (DOD) printer, 
the ink droplets are expelled from the nozzle of a print head only 
when required during the printing process. Drop-on-demand printers 
can use an electrostatically accelerated ink jet or droplet sequences 
ejected by pressure impulse actuation. In the latter kind of DOD 
printer, each drop of ink is individually ejected from a nozzle by 
means of pressure pulses induced e.g. by use of a piezo-electric 
actuator acting on the ink in the channel supplying the nozzle or by 
generation of a vapour bubble in response to a thermal pulse. Inks 
for use in this kind of printer do not need to be electrically 
conductive and preferably are non-ionic and of very low conductivity, 
e.g. having a resistivity of at least 106ohm cm. In ink jet printers which employ piezo-electric actuators having 
electrodes in direct contact with the ink it is important that the ink 
is free of components which would cause bubble generation or 
electrochemical removal of the electrodes. EP-A-0386349 describes an ink specifically developed for use in DOD 
ink jet printers and comprising a solution of a dye in a solvent. 
However, while these inks are successful on certain coated papers they 
are not entirely appropriate for plain papers due to wicking of 
colorant along the fibres and through the paper thickness. As tne coated papers are expensive, it is now generally accepted that 
ink jet printer inks should be capable of producing well-defined
