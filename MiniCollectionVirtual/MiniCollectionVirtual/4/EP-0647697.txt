<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for treating refuse, in particular domestic refuse, which is comminuted and mixed dry with mineral substances heated to a temperature of up to 1000 DEG C, the mixture being homogenised until the refuse has shrunk to a lower desired volume. The invention also relates to a plant for carrying out the process.

<CLAIMS>
Method of treating refuse, the refuse being
comminuted and dried, as well as being mixed with mineral

substances heated to a temperature of up to 1000° C, and
the mixture being homogenised with the exclusion of air,

characterised in that the refuse is household refuse and
dried at a temperature of more than 100° C, and in that the

household refuse and the heated mineral substances are
mixed in the ratio 1:1, and the mixture is homogenised

until the household refuse has shrunk to a smaller volume.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the refuse is comminuted to a particle size of up to 50 mm.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that sand is employed as the mineral substance.
Method according to one of claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that metal granules are employed as the

mineral substances and are separated-out after the
treatment process for re-use.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the mineral substances are heated to

a temperature of between 250° C and 800° C.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that additions, more especially lime or

cement, are added to the mixture.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6 for
producing humus mixtures, more especially for used as

filler or fertiliser material for horticultural or
agricultural purposes, characterised in that the mineral

substances are preheated up to 500° C. 
System for accomplishing the method according to
one of claims 1 to 7, characterised by a refuse shredder

(4) with a subsequently added drying drum (7) and a refuse
silo (9) connected downstream of said drum, by a mineral

substance heater (15) with a subsequently added mineral
substance silo (17), and by a proportioning weigher (24),

which communicates with the two silos (9, 17) and has a
mixer (25) connected downstream thereof, the mixture

passing from said mixer into a thermal reactor (27).
System according to claim 8, characterised in that
the proportioning weigher (24), the mixer (25) and the

thermal reactor (27) are hermetically sealed.
System according to claim 8 or 9, characterised in
that the dr
ying drum (7) for drying the refuse is designed
for indirect heating according to the double-casing system.
System according to one of claims 8 to 10,
characterised in that an afterburning means (32) is

provided for waste gases which have been removed from the
drying drum (7) and/or from the refuse silo (9) and/or from

the thermal reactor (27), and in that the drying drum (7)
is heated with the waste combustion gases from the

afterburning means (32).
System according to one of claims 8 to 11,
characterised in that the mineral substance heater is

configured as a directly heated rotary cylindrical furnace
(15).
System according to claim 12, characterised in that
a dust extractor (20, 21) is connected downstream of the

mineral substance heater (15) at the waste gas end, and in
that the solid substances, which accumulate in the dust

extractor (20, 21), are supplied to the mineral substance
silo (17). 
System according to one of claims 9 to 13,
characterised in that a mixer (29) is connected downstream

of the thermal reactor (27).
