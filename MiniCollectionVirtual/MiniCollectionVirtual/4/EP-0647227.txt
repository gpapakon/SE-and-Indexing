<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a series of purin-6-ones, 
which are potent and selective inhibitors of 
cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase 
(cGMP PDE), having utility in a variety of therapeutic 
areas including the treatment of cardiovascular 
disorders such as angina, hypertension, heart failure 
and atherosclerosis. The compounds of the invention exhibit selectivity 
for inhibition of cGMP PDEs rather than cyclic 
adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterases (cAMP 
PDEs) and, as a consequence of this selective PDE 
inhibition, cGMP levels are elevated, which in turn can 
give rise to beneficial anti-platelet, anti-neutrophil, 
anti-vasospastic and vasodilatory activity, as well as 
potentiation of the effects of endothelium-derived 
relaxing factor (EDRF) and nitrovasodilators. Thus the 
compounds have utility in the treatment of a number of 
disorders, including stable, unstable and variant 
(Prinzmetal) angina, hypertension, pulmonary 
hypertension, congestive heart failure, 
atherosclerosis, conditions of reduced blood vessel 
patency e.g. post-percutaneous transluminal coronary 
angioplasty (post-PTCA), peripheral vascular disease, 
stroke, bronchitis, allergic asthma, chronic asthma, 
allergic rhinitis, glaucoma, and diseases characterised 
by disorders of gut motility, e.g. irritable bowel 
syndrome (IBS). Australian patent application AU-A-10956/88 and 
European patent application EP-A-0352960 disclose 
certain purin-6-ones which, unlike the compounds of the 
present invention, are N-unsubstituted in the imidazole 
portion of the purinone bicyclic system. These prior 
art purinones are reported to be selective cGMP PDE 
inhibitors with bronchodilator and vasodilator  
 
activity, of value in combatting asthma, bronchitis, 
angina, hypertension and congestive heart failure. 
However, compared with the 9-alkylpurin-6-ones of the 
present invention, they are not particularly potent 
cGMP PDE inhibitors. The compounds of the present invention have the 
formula (I): 
 
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, 
wherein 
R1 is C1-C4 alkyl; R2 is C2-C4 alkyl; R3 is H or SO2NR4R5; R4 and R5 together with the nitrogen atom to 
which they are attached form a pyrrolidino, 
piperidino, morpholino or 4-N-(R6)-1-piperazinyl 
group;  
and 
   R6 is H or C1-C3 alkyl. In the above definition, unless otherwise 
indicated, alkyl groups having three or more carbon 
atoms may be straight chain or branched chain. The compounds of formula (I) may contain one or 
more asymmetric centres and
