<ABSTRACT>
Device for packaging articles in film, comprising conveyors (3, 5) for moving the articles (1) along a route (2), feed devices (8, 9) for feeding two film webs (6, 7), a separating and welding device (15) for forming a separating weld across the route between successive articles, which separating and welding device comprises a welding and cutting unit (16) at one side and a counterpressure unit (4) at the opposite side of the route, and also drive means (17) for moving the welding and cutting unit along a closed path, the film webs for forming the separating weld being clamped over a part of this path between the welding and cutting unit and a contact face of the counterpressure unit, characterised in that the path followed by the welding and cutting unit is a smooth curve (A), along which the speed is continuous, save in a possible rest position.

<DESCRIPTION>
Device for packaging articles in film, comprising 
conveyors for moving the articles along a route at an 
essentially constant speed, feed devices for feeding two 
film webs at the top and bottom side of the articles, 
parallel to the route, a separating and welding device for 
forming a separating weld across the route between successive 
articles, which separating and welding device comprises 
a welding and cutting unit at one side and a counterpressure 
unit at the opposite side of the route, and also 
drive means for moving the welding and cutting unit at a 
continuous speed, save in a possible rest position, along a 
substantially elliptical path, the film webs for forming 
the separating weld being clamped over a part of this path 
between the welding and cutting unit and a contact face of 
the couterpressure unit, and the film webs during the 
clamping running at a speed which in magnitude and direction 
is essentially equal to that of the articles to be 
packaged. Such a device is known from GB 1 264 568. The drive 
means of the cutting and welding unit of the known device 
comprises a linkage system. The cutting and welding unit of 
the known device is placed between two arms, each provided 
with an elongated slot through which a shaft fixed to the 
base of the device extends. At their upper ends each of the 
arms is pivotally connected to a lever arm. Each lever arm 
is pivotally connected to a link which is in turn pivotaly 
connected to the base of the device. At a point intermediate their ends the lever arms are 
each connected to a cranck wheel, both cranck wheels being 
fixed on a common shaft. When this shaft is rotatably 
driven this drive means provides an essentially elliptical 
movement of the cutting and welding unit of the device, the 
major axis being substantially at right angles to the route 
along which the articles are moved. A roller journalled on a shaft fixed to the base of  
 
the device forms the counter pressure unit of the known 
device. The known device has the disadvantage that the drive 
means thereof, as described above, constitutes a limitation 
for the operating speed of the device, especially in view 
of the size of the products to be packaged. This is caused 
by the large movements of the heavy arms of the drive 
means. The combination of the accellerations of said moving 
parts and the weight thereof results in large forces, e.g. 
at the pivot points, leading to excessive wear and resulting 
maintenance costs. Furthermore the drive means of the known device do

Device for packaging articles in film, comprising 
conveyors (3, 5) for moving the articles (1) along a route 

(2) at an essentially constant speed, feed devices (8, 9) 
for feeding two film webs (6, 7) at the top and bottom side 

of the articles, parallel to the route, a separating and 
welding device (15) for forming a separating weld across 

the route between successive articles, which separating and 
welding device comprises a welding and cutting unit (16) at 

one side and a counterpressure unit (4) at the opposite 
side of the route, and also drive means (17) for moving the 

welding and cutting unit at a continuous speed, save in a 
possible rest position, along a substantially elliptical 

path (A), the film webs for forming the separating weld 
being clamped over a part of this path between the welding 

and cutting unit and a contact face of the counterpressure 
unit, and the film webs during the clamping running at a 

speed which in magnitude and direction is essentially equal 
to that of the articles to be packaged, 
characterized in 
that
 the drive means (17) consist of a frame (32) which can 
move in a rectilinear guide (18), a rotatable intermediate 

shaft (30) in the frame, a fixed hinge shaft (22) extending 
parallel to the intermediate shaft, a movable arm (20) 

which is pivotally connected to the hinge shaft (22) at one 
end, and at the other end is rotatably connected to an 

eccentric part (28) of the intermediate shaft (30), and a 
rotary shaft lying in line with the hinge shaft, transmission 

means (21, 23, 25) being present between said shaft 
and the eccentric part of the intermediate shaft, in order 

to provide the rotary drive of the eccentric part (28) of 
the intermediate shaft (30), and also two shafts (34, 35) 

which are rotatably disposed in the frame (32) and are

Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
device is provided with detection and control means (52), 

which are designed to set the feed devices (8, 9) for the 
film webs (6, 7) in motion when an article (1) to be packaged

said article has passed through, to make the welding and 

cutting unit run through the path (A) once, from a rest 
position situated thereon.
