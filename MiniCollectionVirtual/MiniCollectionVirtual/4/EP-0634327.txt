<ABSTRACT>
The device (1) for feeding stacks (2) of cutouts (3) 
to a user machine (4), wherein a fork (37) provided with a 

supporting plate (38) suitable to support at least one 
stack (2) of cutouts (3) is connected to a slider (30) that 

can slide along a straight guide (28a) under the action of 
a first motor (36); the guide (28a) can rotate about an 

axis (22) which is transverse to said guide (28a) under the 
action of a second motor (26) which cooperates with the 

first motor (36) to move the fork (37) between a loading 
station (15), where the supporting plate (38) arranges 

itself parallel to a plane (P) for the conveyance of the 
stacks (2), and through an unloading station (15a) formed 

by a magazine (12) of the user machine (4), wherein a stop 
element (9) allows the disengagement of the supporting 

plate (38) from the conveyed stack (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for feeding 
stacks of cutouts to a user machine. In particular, the present invention relates to a 
device for transferring, in a fully automatic manner, 
stacks of cutouts to an input magazine of a user machine, 
constituted for example by a packaging machine. German patent application No. 33 07 675 discloses a 
transfer device of the above described type comprising a 
loop-shaped conveyor for feeding in succession stacks of 
cutouts to a loading station of an L-shaped fork slideable 
along a fixed guide which is aligned with the direction 
along which the stacks advance on the conveyor and is 
inclined downwardly and towards an input magazine of a 
packaging machine. In the above mentioned German patent the conveyor has 
multiple oscillating supports or pockets, each one suitable 
to support a stack, and is formed so that it can oscillate, 
at the loading station, about an axis which lies 
transversely to the advancement direction of the stacks 
along the conveyor to unload the associated stack onto the 
L-shaped fork. This known device has several technical and functional 
drawbacks. First of all, in the above described known 
device it is in fact necessary to provide a conveyor which 
not only extends in a loop on a horizontal plane, thus 
occupying a relatively large space, but also has multiple 
oscillating supports which are intrinsically expensive and 
scarcely reliable.  
 Furthermore, more significantly, the oscillation of 
each support at said loading station is matched by an 
uncontrolled rotation of the stack as it passes from said 
oscillating support to the L-shaped fork, with the 
consequent danger of the breakup of said stack. This is due 
to the fact that the stack, in passing from the 
substantially horizontal direction of advancement along the 
conveyor to the inclined direction of advancement of the L-shaped 
fork, performs a rotation during which it moves with 
no control at all with respect to the L-shaped fork. The aim of the present invention is to provide a 
device of the above described type which is devoid of the 
above mentioned drawbacks. In particular, an object of the present invention is 
to provide a device of the type described above in which 
each stack, during said rotation, does not perform any 
relative movement with respect to the L-shaped fork. According to the present invention, a device is 
provided for feeding stacks of cutouts to a user machine, 
said device comprising a first and a second conveyors for 
the

<CLAIMS>
Device (1) for feeding stacks (2) of cutouts (3) to 
a user machine (4), said device (1) comprising a first 

conveyor (13) and a second conveyor (16) for the 
advancement of a succession of stacks (2) of cutouts (3) in 

a first direction (14) and respectively in a second 

direction (16a), a loading station (15) and an unloading 
station (15a) which are mutually offset; said loading 

station (15) being interposed between the first conveyor
