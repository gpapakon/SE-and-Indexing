<ABSTRACT>
The balancing bridge circuit (11) is provided 
between a four-wire circuit and a two-wire circuit, to 

provide a thin-type balancing bridge circuit having 
satisfactory transmission characteristics and a MODEM 

having this balancing bridge circuit built therein. The 
transmitting terminals (E, F) of the four-wire circuit 

and the connection points (A, C) of the balancing bridge 
circuit are connected together through the photo-coupler 

(12). The receiving terminals (G, H) of the four-wire 
circuit and the connection points (B, D) of the balancing 

bridge circuit are connected together through the photo-coupler 
(13). The terminals (J, K) of the two-wire 

circuit are connected to the connection points (C, D) of 
the balancing bridge circuit. By the presence of the 

compact photo-couplers (12, 13), it is possible to ground 
the transmitting terminal (F) and the receiving terminal 

(H) together. Common-mode noise reaching the terminals 
(J, K) is not transmitted to the receiving terminals 

(G, F).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hybrid 
circuit for carrying out a four-wire to two-wire 
conversion of a channel and a data communication unit 
such as a MODEM for incorporating the hybrid circuit, and 
relates to a MODEM front end unit having a unit for 
insulating between terminals of a four-wire circuit and a 
two-wire circuit respectively and a data communication 
unit. In order to carry out a data communication 
through a public circuit switching network, it is 
necessary to have a MODEM, and it is further necessary to 
have a hybrid circuit for carrying out a four-wire to 
two-wire conversion of the channel. U.S. Patent No. 3,955,051 or "CMOS Integrated 
Circuit Data Book, JANUARY 1992", pp. 200 - 201 teaches a 
hybrid circuit. None of these conventional hybrid 
circuits provides an isolation between the four-wire 
circuit and the two-wire circuit, and therefore, these 
hybrid circuits can not be connected to the public 
circuit in this state. In order to overcome this 
difficulty, a line transformer L has been provided with 
the conventional hybrid circuit 5 in the front end unit 4 
to make it possible to carry out a data communication, 
while providing an isolation between the circuits, as  
 
shown in Fig. 17. However, there is a tendency that a 
line transformer for data transmission with better transmission 
characteristics requires a larger external size. 
Therefore, in order to obtain practically satisfactory 
transmission characteristics for a transformer having an 
inductance of about one Henry and an isolation breakdown 
voltage of about 1000 V for a circuit current, at least 
one centimeter thickness of the line transformer is 
required, so that there has been a limit to a further 
compact and thinner size of the front end unit 4. 
Accordingly, in order to pursue a further compactness and 
a thinner size for the front end unit 4, it is essential 
to develop a circuit structure which enables a data 
transmission while obtaining an isolation between the 
circuits, without using a line transformer or the like. 
The insulation breakdown voltage of a front end circuit 
using a capacitor instead of a transformer will be about 
250 V. Further, there has been known a conventional 
four-wire to two-wire conversion hybrid circuit including 
an operational amplifier for taking balance to prevent a 
transmission signal from being leaked to receiving 
terminals, and providing isolation between the bridge 
circuit and the transmitting terminals and between the 
bridge circuit and the receiving
