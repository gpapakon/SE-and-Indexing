<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus, particularly an evaporation cooler and a spray drier, comprises a vertically arranged reactor housing (1), to which the gas is supplied in the vertical direction through a supply conduit (2) and through which it flows in the vertical direction, liquid and, if appropriate, solid particles being supplied to the gas by means of at least one nozzle (6). In order to achieve a uniform supply of the gas stream parallel to the longitudinal mid-axis of the reactor housing (1) and an intensive mixing of liquid and, if appropriate, solid particles with the gas over the shortest possible mixing distance, the mouth of the supply conduit (2) is designed as an impact diffuser (7). At least one built-in vortex surface (8) generating a front-edge vortex system is arranged in the region of this impact diffuser (7).

<CLAIMS>
Device for the cooling of gases and, in a given case, drying of solid 
substance particles added to the gas, in particular evaporation cooler 

and spray drier, with a vertically arranged reactor housing (1), to which 
the gas is fed in vertical direction through at least one feed duct (2) 

constructed as collision diffuser (7) and which is flowed through in 
vertical direction, wherein liquid and, in a given case, solid substance 

particles are fed through at least one nozzle (6) to the gas after its 
entry into the reactor housing (1), characterised thereby, that at least 

one whirl baffle (8) producing a front edge turbulence system is arranged 
in the region of the collision diffuser (7). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that whirl 
baffles (9) are additionally arranged in the reactor housing (1) in flow 

direction behind the collision diffuser (7). 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby, that the 
nozzles (6) for the feed of liquid and, in a given case, solid substance 

particles are each arranged in the range of action of a whirl baffle (8).
