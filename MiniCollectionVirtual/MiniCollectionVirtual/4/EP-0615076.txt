<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic chain tensioner including a retractable ratchet mechanism. A 
ratchet pawl in the form of a cylindrical plunger received in a bore formed in the 

tensioner housing is normally biased into engagement with grooves formed on the 
output member of the tensioner. The bore is in communication with a source of 

pressurized engine oil so that when the engine is operating the force produced by 
the oil pressure acting against the plunger overcomes the biasing force and 

disengages the plunger from the output member. When the engine is stopped the 
oil pressure goes to zero and the biasing force is again effective to move the 

plunger into engagement with the output member to maintain its axial position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to chain tensioners and more particularly to a 
ratchet mechanism for a hydraulic chain tensioner. Chain tensioners are well know in the art, particularly those wherein a 
hydraulic module is employed to provide a force directly against a movable guide 
which bears against the timing chain of an internal combustion engine to take up 
slack in the timing chain. An example of such a tensioner is shown in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,874,352 to Suzuki. Typical examples of hydraulic modules for such 
tensioners are shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,894,047 to Breon et al and U.S. Patent 
No. 4,997,411 to Breon et al, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. In a typical hydraulic chain tensioner, an output member is biased in a 
protruding direction against the chain guide by the combined force of a spring and 
hydraulic pressure to maintain a predetermined tension in the chain. A check valve 
in the hydraulic circuit of the tensioner prevents retraction of the output member 
under conditions wherein the force exerted on the chain guide by the chain 
exceeds the spring force. When the engine is shut down and no oil pressure is 
present in the tensioner, the output member can retract, allowing the chain to 
slacken, resulting in noise and vibration on start-up until sufficient hydraulic 
pressure is built up to again maintain the predetermined chain tension. To maintain chain tension during engine shut-down, current hydraulic 
tensioners include mechanical ratchet mechanisms acting on the output member, 
as exemplified by the tensioner shown in U.S. patent No. 4,874,352. Such 
ratchet mechanisms are spring-loaded into constant engagement with the output 
member and thus are subjected to all the forces and force variations to which the 
tensioner components are subjected while the engine is running. Accordingly, the 
ratchet mechanism must be rather robust in construction, requiring significant 
additional space in an environment wherein space is generally at a premium. The present invention takes advantage of the fact that the ratchet function 
is only required when the engine is shut down, and thus provides a retractable 
ratchet which engages the output member when the engine is shut down to 
maintain the position of the tensioner and thus the chain tension, but which 
retracts when the engine is operating. Because of this manner of operation, the  
 
ratchet mechanism does not have to be designed to withstand the operating 
conditions to which the tensioner is subjected, as
