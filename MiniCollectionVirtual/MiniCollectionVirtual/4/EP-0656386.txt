<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
organopolysiloxanes. More specifically, the invention relates to
a certain type of organopolysiloxanes that cure rapidly upon
exposure to high-energy radiation, e.g., ultraviolet radiation,
electron beam, and so forth, in the presence of a
photopolymerization initiator to yield a highly heat-resistant
product. The invention further relates to a method for the
preparation of such certain organopolysiloxanes.Organopolysiloxanes that contain trifunctional siloxane
units exhibit excellent heat resistance and a capacity for film
formation. For these reasons such organopolysiloxanes are used,
inter alia, as electrical insulating materials, heat-resistant
coatings, protective coatings, starting material for the
preparation of copolymers with organic resin monomers, and agents
for improving the physical properties of curable organic resins.
phenyl-containing branched organopolysiloxanes are particularly
heat-resistant and as a result are used as insulating materials 
and paints for service in high-temperature environments where
ordinary organic resins cannot be employed.It is also known that (meth)acryloyl-functional
organopolysiloxanes can be cured by exposure to high-energy
radiation, such as ultraviolet light or an electron beam.
Methods for the preparation of such organopolysiloxanes are also
already known.For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open
[Kokai or Unexamined] Number Sho 56-86922 [86,922/1981] teaches
the preparation of a (meth)acryloyl-functional organopolysiloxane
by the reaction of an epoxy-functional organopolysiloxane with
acrylic or methacrylic acid.Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Number Sho 63-135426
[135,426/1988] also discloses a method for the preparation
of an organopolysiloxane that is curable by high-energy
radiation. This method consists of the successive reaction of an
epoxy-functional organopolysiloxane first with acrylic or
methacrylic acid and then with acryloyl or methacryloyl chloride.Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Number Sho 63-196629
[196,629/1988] teaches the reaction of an epoxy-functional
organopolysiloxane with a mixture of methacrylic acid and
methacrylic anhydride.However, the (meth)acryloyl-functional
organopolysiloxanes afforded by the prior art exhibit poor
curability and yield poorly heat-resistant cured products and are
therefore excluded from use in some applications. The drawbacks 
of the prior art are overcome by the present invention. The
novel radiation-curable organopolysiloxanes of the
