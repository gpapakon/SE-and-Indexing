<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a light emitting diode 
(LED) includes providing a temporary growth substrate 

(30) that is selected for compatibility with fabricating 
LED layers (32, 34, 36 and 38) having desired mechanical 

characteristics. For example, lattice matching is an 
important consideration. LED layers are then grown on 

the temporary growth substrate. High crystal quality is 

thereby achieved, whereafter the temporary growth substrate 
can be removed. A second substrate (42) is bonded 

to the LED layers utilizing a wafer bonding technique. 
The second substrate is selected for optical properties, 

rather than mechanical properties. Preferably, the second 
substrate is optically transparent and electrically 

conductive and the wafer bonding technique is carried out 
to achieve a low resistance interface between the second 

substrate and the LED layers. Wafer bonding can also be 
carried out to provide passivation or light-reflection or 

to define current flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
light emitting diodes and more particularly to methods of 
fabricating light emitting diodes. Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are employed in a 
wide variety of applications. For example, in optical 
data transmission, LEDs are used to launch data signals 
along a fiberoptic cable. Unlike lasers, LEDs do not generate well-focused 
beams of light. Rather, an LED radiates light in 
all directions. That is, the light emission is isotropic. 
The layers of many conventional LEDs are grown on an 
optically absorbing substrate having an energy gap less 
than the emission energy of the active region of the LED. 
The substrate absorbs some of the light generated within 
the active region, thereby reducing the efficiency of the 
device. An example of a prior art aluminum gallium arsenide 
(AlGaAs) LED of the single heterojunction type is 
shown in Fig. 1. An epitaxial layer 10 of p-doped AlGaAs 
and an epitaxial layer 12 of n-doped AlGaAs are grown on 
a surface of a p-doped gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate 
14. The conduction of current through the junction of 
the epitaxial layers 10 and 12 will generate light. However, 
since the energy gap of the absorbing substrate 14 
is less than the emission energy, light that is emitted 
or internally reflected downwardly toward the substrate 
14 will be absorbed. Fig. 2 is a double heterojunction AlGaAs LED on 
an absorbing substrate 16. An epitaxial layer 18 of 
n-doped AlGaAs and two layers 20 and 22 of p-doped AlGaAs 
are grown on the absorbing substrate 16. The bandgaps of 
the epitaxial layers 18-22 are chosen to cause light to  
 
be generated in the active layer 20 and to travel through 
the epitaxial layers 18 and 22 without being absorbed. 
However, absorption of light does occur at the substrate 
16. Improved performance can be achieved by employing 
a transparent substrate that has an energy gap 
greater than the emission energy of the LED active 
region. The effect of the transparent substrate is to 
prevent the downwardly emitted or directed light from 
being absorbed. Rather, the light passes through the 
transparent substrate and is reflected from a bottom 
metal adhesive and reflecting cup. The reflected light 
is then emitted from the top or the edges of the chip to 
substantially improve the efficiency of the LED. There are several techniques for fabricating 
LEDs having transparent substrates. A first technique is 
to epitaxially grow the p-n junction on a transparent 
substrate. However, a problem with this
