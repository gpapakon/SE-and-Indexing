<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to piperazine derivatives, to
processes for their preparation, to their use and to
pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The novel
compounds act on the central nervous system by binding to
5-HT receptors (as more fully explained below) and hence
can be used as medicaments for treating humans and other
mammals.EP-A-0343691 (in the name of American Home Products
Corporation) discloses compounds of the formula:

wherein R1 is 1-adamantyl, 3-methyl-1-adamantyl, 3-nordamantyl,
unsubstituted or substituted 2-indolyl, 3-indolyl,
2-benzofuranyl and 3-benzofuranyl wherein the
substitutents are selected from lower alkyl, lower alkoxy
and halo; R2 is unsubstituted or substituted phenyl,
benzyl, pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl or pyrazinyl, wherein the
substituents are selected from lower alkyl, lower alkoxy,
trifluoromethyl and halo; R3 is H or lower alkyl of 1 to
3 carbon atoms, n is the integer 0 or 1 and m is an
integer from 2 to 5. The compounds are described as
possessing central nervous system activity.The novel compounds of the invention are those of the
general formula
 
and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts
thereof.In formula (I)
A is an alkylene chain of 2 to 5 carbon atoms
optionally substituted by one or more lower alkyl
groups,R represents hydrogen or one or two same or different
lower alkyl groups,R1 is
phenyl radical which optionally
may be substituted by one or more substituents selected from
C1-6 alkyl, C1-6 alkoxy, halogen, halo(C1-6)alkyl, nitro,
nitrile, amido, (C1-6)alkoxycarbonyl, amino, (C1-6)alkylamino
or di(C1-6)alkylamino or a monocyclic or heteroaryl radical,R2 is a mono or bicyclic aryl radicaland R3 is cycloalkyl.The term "lower" as used herein means that the radical
referred to contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Preferably
such radicals contain 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Examples of
"lower alkyl" radicals are methyl, ethyl, propyl,
isopropyl, butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl and isopentyl.The cycloalkyl group contains 3 to 12 carbon atoms.
Preferably a cycloalkyl group is cyclopentyl,
cyclohexyl or cycloheptyl, most preferably cyclohexyl.
Cycloalkyl groups also include bicyclic, tricyclic and
tetracyclic groups, eg adamantyl.The term
"a mono or bicyclic aryl
radical" means an aromatic radical having 6 to 12
carbon atoms (eg phenyl or naphthyl) which optionally
may be substituted by one or more substituents selected from
lower alkyl, lower alkoxy
(eg methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy), halogen,
halo(lower)alkyl (eg trifluoromethyl), nitro, nitrile,
carbamoyl,
