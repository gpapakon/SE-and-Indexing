<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to coated granular
magnetite particles and a process for producing the same.Coated granular magnetite particles according to the
present invention are chiefly intended as materials for
coloring pigments for coating materials, printing inks and
resins, and materials for magnetic toners and magnetic
carriers.Since granular magnetite particles are black, they are
widely used as materials for a black coloring pigment which
is dispersed in a vehicle or mixed with a resin.In addition, since granular magnetite particles are
black ferrimagnetic particles, they are mixed with and
dispersed in a resin so as to produce composite particles
which are also widely used as a particle material for
magnetic toners and magnetic carriers for electrostatic
copying. When granular magnetite particles are used as a
material for a black coloring pigment, if the granular
magnetite particles have too high a coercive force,
magnetic reagglomeration is produced among the particles, which
makes the dispersion of the particles in a vehicle or a
resin difficult. From the point of view of dispersibility,
granular magnetite particles are required to have a
coercive force of not more than about 300 Oe.When granular magnetite particles are used as a
material for a magnetic toner, (1) it is preferable that
the granular magnetite particles have a high coercive force
in order to improve the carrying property and the fluidity
of the magnetic toner, but in order to improve the
dispersibility of the magnetic particles and the turbulence
of the magnetic toner, to activate the contact, to improve the separation
and the friction both between the magnetic particles and between
the magnetic particles and the sleeve of the developing
equipment, and to improve the developing property, the
coercive force thereof must be not more than about 300 Oe.(2) On the other hand, when used as a material for a
magnetic toner, in order to prevent the reduction in the
image density in continuous copying and to prevent
defective development such as a part of the image being missing, the
coercive force of the granular magnetite particles should
preferably be as low as possible, particularly not more than
150 Oe. As described above, granular magnetite particles are
widely used as materials for a black coloring pigment.
Since they are often exposed to a high temperature of not
lower than 150°C, particularly not lower than 200°C, they
are required to keep a stable tone at a temperature of not
lower than 150°C, particularly not lower than
