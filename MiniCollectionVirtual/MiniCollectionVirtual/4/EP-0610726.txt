<ABSTRACT>
In a device (1) for holding bar-shaped workpieces which consists of a base plate (11) provided with clamping means (21), two flexible tongues (24, 25) pivotable in the plane of the base plate (11) are provided as clamping means (21). The tongues (24, 25) are in each case formed by an aperture (22) made in the base plate (11) and act in pairs on the clamped workpiece. Not only is this holding device (1) of exceptionally simple design and thus economical to produce, but reliable holding of the workpieces in different vertical positions is also guaranteed.

<CLAIMS>
A device (1) for holding rod-shaped articles, in particular for holding cylindrical
containers, e.g. in the form of test tubes (10), comprising a base plate (11)

arranged at a distance from a base, with the base plate (11) possessing
clamping elements (21) for holding the article to be held and with at least two

springing tongues (24, 25; 33, 34, 35, 36; 43, 44) provided as clamping
elements (21; 31; 41) which can be pivoted in the plane of the base plate (11)

and which are formed by a penetration (22; 32; 42) worked into the base plate
(11) and act in pairs on the clamped article (test tube 10),
characterised in that,

the springing tongues (24, 25) are each provided with a pre-stressed insert or
support in the form of a spring ring (29), a leaf spring (30; 52) or similar.
The holding device in accordance with Claim 1,
characterised in that,
 
the springing tongues (24, 25) are provided with three or more stop cams (63,

64, 65) formed onto the inside surfaces (61, 62) of the springing tongues (24,
25), with the stop cams (63, 64, 65) projecting inwards beyond the inside

surfaces (61, 62) and arranged in a radial orientation.
The holding device in accordance with Claim 2,
characterised in that,

one of the stop cams (63) is located in the area of the web (23) which
connects the springing tongues (24, 25) to the base plate (11) and each of the

springing tongues (24, 25) has a stop cam (64, 65) in its end area.
The holding device in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that,

The springing tongues (24, 25) are provided with projections (51) extending
axially in relation to the article (10) to be held and, in a preferred embodiment,

formed onto the underside of the base plate (11).
The holding device in accordance with Claim 4,
characterised in that,

the pre-stressed inserts and/or supports (52) are arranged in and/or on the
projections (51).
The holding device in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that,
 
the springing tongues (24, 25) are provided with three or more stop cams (66,

67, 68) projecting beyond the surface of the base plate (11).
The holding device in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that,

the stop cams (63, 64, 65) and the stop cams (66, 67, 68) of the springing
tongues (24, 25) are jointly formed onto the springing tongues (24, 25) or onto

these and the web (23), with the stop cams (63, 64, 65) and the stop cams
(66, 67, 68) being arranged, in a preferred embodiment, radially abutting one

another.
The holding device in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that,

the length of the springing tongues (24, 25) is such that they are directly in
contact with one another or with a stop (71) in their initial position with their

end surfaces (69, 70) free.
The holding device in accordance with Claim 8,
characterised in that,

the stop (71) which acts in conjunction with the springing tongues (24, 25) is
formed by a shoulder (72) projecting radially from the base plate (11) opposite

to the web (23) which connects the springing tongues (24, 25) to the base
plate (11).
The holding device in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that,
 
the recess (14) or the penetration is each provided with at least one stop (28

or support surfaces 45, 46) worked onto the base plate (11) for the article (10)
to be clamped.
The holding device in accordance with Claim 10,
characterised in that,

the stop (28) is formed by the web (23) which connects the springing tongues
(24, 25) to the base plate (11).
The holding device in accordance with Claim 11,
characterised in that,

the springing tongues (24, 25) are provided, in a preferred embodiment, with
an inwardly projecting cam (26, 27) at each of their free ends, with the cam

(26, 27) serving to contact the article (10) to be clamped.
The holding device in accordance with Claim 10,
characterised in that,

the stop is formed by two support surfaces (45, 46) diverging from one
another and each delimiting the penetrations (42).
