<DESCRIPTION>
"PROCESS FOR PREPARING 3-ACYLESTRATRIENES AND ACYLBENZENES"The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of substituted steroidal benzo esters and substituted steroidal benzo acids. Such compounds are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,954,446; 4,937,237; 4,970,205 and 4,882,319 as being useful for or preparing compounds which are useful for inhibiting steroid 5-α-reductase.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONProcesses for the preparation of substituted steroidal benzo esters and substituted steroidal benzo acids have previously been described. In particular the use of trifluoromethane sulfonic anhydride to convert steroidal A-ring phenols to steroidal trifluoromethyl sulfonate intermediates (in >95% yield) followed by metal-catalyzed carbonylation to the benzoic ester (in 73% yield) with subsequent hydrolysis to the corresponding benzoic acid (in 90% yield) is reported in U.S. Patent No. 4,954,446.Further, said steroidal trifluoromethyl sulfonate intermediate has been reacted in metal-catalyzed coupling reactions in the presence of various coupling reagents (followed by an optional, if applicable hydrolysis reaction) to form the corresponding steroidal 

 benzo esters and the corresponding steroidal benzo acids in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,937,237 and 4,882,319.In addition to a low overall yield, the principle shortcoming of these disclosures is that trifluoromethane sulfonic anhydride is an expensive reagent adding significant cost to an industrial process. Thus, there is a need in the art for a safe, economical and reliable method to convert steroidal phenols to steroidal benzo esters and steroidal benzo acids.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to an improved process for converting phenols to benzo esters and benzo acids.This invention relates to an improved process for converting steroidal phenols to steroidal benzo esters and steroidal benzo acids.This invention specifically relates to an improved process for the preparation of 17Ji-(N-t- butylcarboxamide)-estr-1,3,5(10)-triene-3-carboxylic acid and hydrates thereof.In a further aspect of the invention there are provided novel intermediates useful in the presently invented process.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention provides a process for the production of a benzo acid or a benzo ester which comprises reacting a phenol with fluorosulfonic anhydride and a base, preferably a tertiaryamine base such as triethylamine, pyridine or tributylamine in an appropriate solvent to form a benzo fluorosulfonate compound
