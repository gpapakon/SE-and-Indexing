<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to bicycles,
and more particularly to a bicycle possessing shock
absorbing suspension characteristics which do not adversely
affect the performance of the bicycle.The primary structural component of a bicycle is the
bicycle frame. Typically, the bicycle frame comprises an
elongate crossbar which is rigidly secured to and extends
between a head tube of the bicycle and a seat tube of the
bicycle. The head tube typically provides a structural
base for the stem of the bicycle to which the handle bars
are attached. The seat tube provides a base for a seat
post which is generally telescopically received therewithin
and to which is secured that saddle or seat of the bicycle.
In typical bicycle frame construction, the seat tube
includes a generally cylindrical member attached to the
lower end thereof which is adapted to receive the bottom
bracket axle. The bottom bracket axle typically extends
between and interconnects the cranks to which are attached
the pedals. Rigidly secured to and extending between the
head tube and the cylindrical axle receiving bracket is an
elongate down tube.In addition to the aforementioned structural
components, rigidly secured to and extending rearwardly
from the axle receiving bracket are first and second chain
stay members. Additionally, rigidly secured to and 
extending downwardly from the upper end of the seat tube
are first and second seat stay members having distal ends
which are rigidly secured to the rear ends of the first and
second chain stay members. Typically, the distal ends of
the seat stay members and rear ends of the chain stay
members are interconnected in a manner adapted to receive
the rear tire axle of the bicycle.The foregoing description generally represents the
construction of conventional prior art bicycle frames.
Typically, once such prior art frames are constructed, the
aforementioned structural components are rigidly secured to
one another through the use of welding or brazing
techniques. Though this method of constructing the bicycle
frame provides the resulting frame with structural
integrity, the bicycle frame does not possess a suspension
having shock absorbing characteristics. As will be
recognized, the riding comfort and performance of the
bicycle would be greatly enhanced if the bicycle frame were
adapted to at least partially accommodate the shocks
routinely encountered while riding the bicycle.Though recent prior art bicycle frames include front
and/or rear shock absorbing assemblies, such bicycle frames
poss

<CLAIMS>
A shock absorbing bicycle frame (12) comprising:

a head tube (14) having a top end and a bottom end;
an elongate seat tube (16) having an upper end and a lower end;
a first elongate crossbar (36) rigidly attached to and extending between said
head tube (14) and said seat tube (16);
an axle receiving bracket (38) rigidly attached to said lower end of said seat tube
(16) and defining an axle receiving bore (40) extending axially therethrough;
an elongate down tube (48) rigidly attached to and extending between said head
tube (14) and said axle receiving bracket (38);
a second crossbar (50) disposed between said first crossbar and said axle
receiving bracket and having a front end rigidly attached to said down tube (48) and a

back end rigidly attached to said seat tube (16);
a rocker arm linkage member (54) pivotally connected to said axle receiving
bracket (38), said rocker arm linkage member having upper (76) and lower (86)

portions;
a shock absorber (56) having a first end pivotally connected to said second
crossbar (50) and a second end pivotally connected to the upper portion of said rocker

arm linkage member (54);
first and second chain stay members (82, 84);
a pair of rear tire axle receiving members (88); and
first and second seat stay members (94, 96) having front ends pivotally
connected to opposed sides of said second crossbar (50) and back ends rigidly

attached to the pair of rear tire axle receiving members (88);

   characterised in that the first (82) and second (84) chain stay members have
front ends pivotally connected to opposed sides of the lower portion (86) of said rocker 

arm linkage member (54) and back ends rigidly attached to the pair of rear tire axle
receiving members (88), and wherein said rocker arm linkage member (54) is positioned

relative said axle receiving bracket (38) such that the lower portion (86) is disposed
below said axle receiving bracket (38) and the upper portion (76) is disposed between

said seat stay members (94, 96) and said chain stay members (82, 84)
The bicycle frame of Claim 1 wherein said shock absorber (56) is adapted to
exert a force on said upper portion of said rocker arm linkage member (54) so as to

cause a said lower portion of said rocker arm linkage member (54) to be normally
abutted against said axle receiving bracket (38).
The bicycle frame (12) of Claim 2 wherein said rocker arm linkage member (54)
is adapted to pivot relative said axle receiving bracket (38) such that said lower portion

(86) moves out of abutting contact with said axle receiving bracket (38) and said upper
portion (76) compresses said shock absorber (56) when an upward force is applied to

the rear tire axle receiving members (88) in an amount sufficient to overcome the force
normally applied to said upper portion by said shock absorber (56).
The bicycle frame (12) of Claim 3 wherein said shock absorber (56) is configured
so as to allow for the selective adjustment of the amount of force exerted on the upper

portion (76) of the rocker arm linkage member (54) thereby.
The bicycle frame of Claim 3 further comprising a pad member (102) attached to
the lower portion (86) of the rocker arm linkage member (54) so as to be disposed

between said lower portion (86) and said axle receiving bracket (38) when said lower
portion (86) is abutted thereagainst.
The bicycle frame of Claim 3 further comprising:

a bottom bracket axle extending through said axle receiving bracket (38);
a main sprocket (46) attached to one end of said bottom bracket axle and
adapted to rotate concurrently therewith; 
a pair of cranks (42) having proximal ends attached to the opposed ends of said
bottom bracket axle and distal ends including a pair of pedals (44) pivotally connected

thereto;
a rear tire axle (90) extending between said pair of rear tire axle receiving
members (88);
a rear sprocket (98) attached to one end of said rear tire axle (90) and adapted

to rotate concurrently therewith; and
a continuous chain (100) cooperatively engaging said main sprocket (46) to said
rear sprocket (98);
said chain (100) being operable to exert a pulling force on said rear sprocket
(98) when said main sprocket (46) is rotated via said pedals (44), cranks (42) and

bottom bracket axle, said pulling force being operable to cause said rear sprocket (98)
to apply a forward pushing force to said chain stay members (82, 84) thus increasing

the force of abutting contact between said lower portion (86) and said axle receiving
bracket (38).
The bicycle frame (12) of Claim 6 wherein said rocker arm linkage member (54)
is adapted to pivot relative said axle receiving bracket (38) when the upward force is

applied to the rear tire axle receiving members (88) in an amount sufficient to overcome
the force normally applied to said upper portion (76) by said shock absorber (56) and

the pushing force applied to the chain stay members (82, 84) by the rear sprocket (98).
The bicycle frame (12) of Claim 1 wherein said seat tube (16) includes an
aperture extending therethrough which is sized and configured to allow passage of a

portion of the shock absorber (56).
A bicycle frame (12) as in Claim 1, wherein said rocker arm linkage member (54)
is adapted to compress said shock absorber (56) such that in use upward pivotal 

movement of said pair of rear tire axle receiving members (88) is operable to cause said
rocker arm linkage member (54) to compress said shock absorber (56).
