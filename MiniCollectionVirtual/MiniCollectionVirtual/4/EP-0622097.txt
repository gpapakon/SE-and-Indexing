<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a pair of downhill snow 
skis (10) having deep side cuts which allow greater 

maneuverability and safety, particularly on steep slopes (19). 
Each ski is provided with two cutting edges (12,13) on each side, as 

contrasted to one on each side in ordinary skis. The lower 
edge (12), on the bottom (14) of the ski, is active when the angle 

between the ski and the slope ranges from near zero up to 52 
degrees; the upper edge (13), near the top of the ski, is active 

at angles greater than 52 degrees. These edges provide 
ability to execute true carved turns of about one-tenth to 

one quarter the radii of turns executed by ordinary skis 
(about 20 to 45 feet as compared to about 200 feet).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a downhill snow 
ski having two cutting edges on each side with deep side 
cuts for greater maneuverability. The natural carved turn radius of a ski is 
determined by the relation between its length and side cut, 
and the angle theta formed between the ski and the slope 
during turns. The turn radius is not constant for a given 
ski, but decreases with increasing theta angle. 
Mathematically, the nominal turning radius of a ski is 
defined by the following equation (from "Skiing Mechanics" 
by John Howe, 1983, p. 102): r = (L²Cos theta)/8sc, where r 
is the natural carved turn radius of the ski, L is the 
length of the ski, sc is the side cut of the ski, and theta 
is as defined above. The natural turning radius of skis is 
ordinarily 150 to over 200 feet. A much shorter turning 
radius is desirable, particularly on steep slopes, because 
this is the dominant factor in control of speed and balance. 
The long turning radius of conventional skis leads to 
unacceptably high speeds during turns, even on moderate 
slopes. Only expert skiers on especially designed slopes can 
make true carved turns; most skiers maintain only imperfect 
control as a result of these long turning radii. In 
addition to the danger to themselves and others resulting 
from this instability, they must side-slip the back of their 
skis to shorten the turn and thereby reduce speed to  
 
maintain control. Side-slipping results in effective loss of 
a significant portion of the ski edges with resulting loss 
of supporting "platform". Side-slipping requires unweighting 
of the skis, a maneuver many skiers never adequately learn 
and which in any case requires much energy. On steeper 
slopes, this side-slipping results in the formation of 
moguls. Another advantage of a short turning radius is 
that lower speeds are possible without dropping below the 
speed necessary to overcome critical angle effects 
encountered at the beginning of turns. The critical angle 
is defined as that angle of traverse below which the skier 
is unstable when gravitational forces in the plane of the 
slope equal or exceed the centrifugal force generated by a 
turn. Since centrifugal force varies directly with the 
square of the velocity and inversely with the radius of the 
turn, skis with shorter turning radii generate much greater 
centrifugal force at a given velocity. For example, skis 
with a natural turning radius of 45 feet require a velocity 
of only 15 MPH to maintain stability on a slope of 20 
degrees at the
