<ABSTRACT>
A novel dimming assembly for controlling light intensity of a gas 
discharge lamp (1,2), including:

 
   dimming controller (17,17') having an input terminal (21,21') connectable 

to one pole of an alternating current source and having an output 
terminal connectable to the line leading to one of the two filament electrodes 

(5,5') of the lamp, the dimming controller (17,17') being adapted to provide 
an attenuated and conditioned power at its output terminal;

 
   the dimming controller (17,17') is being adapted upon feeding the input 

terminal (21,21') with the current, to operate in a full power mode for a time 
period t₁, during which the link between the two terminals is in full conductance 

bringing about full light intensity of the discharge lamp, and being 
further adapted after t₁ to enter into a dimming mode, during which the link 

between the two terminals is in partial conductance bringing about 
attenuated intensity of the discharge lamp; the said time t₁ is sufficient to 

facilitate effective dimming in the dimming mode. By another embodiment 
the dimming controller is being adapted upon feeding the input terminal with 

the current, to gradually switching, for a period t₂, into dimming mode in 
which the link between the two terminals is in partial conductance bringing 

about attenuated intensity of the discharge lamp, the said time delay t₂ is 
sufficient for facilitating effective dimming.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns an apparatus for dimming light of
gas discharge lamps such as fluorescent lamps.It is very often desired to utilize a lamp at a less than maximum
intensity. for this purpose, typically dimmers are installed in the circuit
supplying the electric power to such lamps.Most dimmers operate on a basis of chopping the power,
meaning, transmitting only through part of the time of the alternating current
cycle, shutting it off during the rest. The extent of the transmission time in
each cycle determines the amount of dimming.Dimmers typically consist of a user-controlled potentiometer
operating in conjunction with a triac or an SCR.Most available dimmers, particularly such as available in domestic
use, are capable of dimming a light of lamps such as incandescent type
lamps or halogen lamps. However, standard dimmers are unsuitable for 
dimming light of gas discharge lamps such as fluorescent lamps, high or low
pressure mercury or sodium lamps, etc. When attempting to dim such lamps
by conventional dimmers that are used for example, for incandescent or
halogen lamps, the light of a gas discharge lamp either flickers or extinguishes
altogether.There is a long felt need for dimmers suitable for use with gas
discharge lamps particularly in view of the popularity of such types of
lamps. As in no doubt is known to the artisan, the popularity of such lamps
stems to a large extent from their very high efficiency, meaning the very
high ratio of illumination intensity to power consumption.Gas discharge lamps have a gas filled space or tube with two
spaced electrodes (heated or not). When heated, an electrode is a two
terminal filament. One terminal of each of the two electrode is connected
to a pole of the AC power source and the other terminals of the two
electrodes are typically linked together by the intermediary of a so-called
"starter".A choke/ballast is installed between one of the electrodes and the
respective pole of the power source and sometimes a capacitor is installed
in series or parallel to the lamp to correct the power factor (cos-fi) and/or
limit the current.In order to initiate an electric discharge through the gas, an initial
high voltage, that can supply enough electric charge is required. When the
power is turned on, an appropriate voltage is to be generated to cause such
a discharge.For a fluorescent lamp, that has heated electrodes, the electric
current flows at first, through the choke, one filament electrode of the starter
and the second filament electrode of the
