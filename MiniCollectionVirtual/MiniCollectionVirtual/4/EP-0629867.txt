<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a probe structure used
for measurement of various electric characteristics of a
semiconductor element such as an integrated circuit
(hereinafter referred to as "IC") or used for a burn-in test
conducted at high temperature. More particularly, it relates
to a probe structure which can be used for measurement of
various electric characteristics in a wafer state of IC before
dicing.A conventional burn-in test of an IC chip employs a
method of packaging IC, inserting the packaged IC in a socket
disposed on a printed circuit board and testing while applying
a load voltage at high temperature, but the requirement of IC
already subjected to a burn-in test of an unpackaged IC chip
before packaging (die level) and an electric test has been
increased for a chip on board or a multichip module which has
recently been rapidly progressed.In particular, testing of IC before dicing it from a
wafer (wafer scale) has many advantages that not only the cost
for the test is decreased but also the testing apparatus is
small-sized, the testing time is shortened, the yield is
improved by the feedback of the cause of defective to the pre-step
of the production of IC, the shipment is rationalized, etc. A so-called probe card having bumps for connecting an
electrically conductive circuit and IC pads to an insulating
holder having a flexibility has recently been developed to
conduct the electric test in a die level, as disclosed in, for
example, JP-A-62-182672,
but the
prove card is for the test in a die level.Very close wiring is required to test all ICs on a
wafer at the same time in a wafer scale, and to attain the
requirement, it is necessary to make wiring very close or
employ a multilayer wiring structure.However, if a multilayer wiring structure is employed
to increase the wiring density, the flexibility of the probe
card is lost, whereby it is impossible to absorb the variation
of the heights of IC pads, and a good connection between the
-bump of the probe card and the IC pads cannot be obtained.Even if monolayer wiring can be attained using a high
density wiring board, where an organic polymeric material
having a flexibility, such as polyimide, an epoxy resin,
polyether imide, polysulfone, benzocyclobutene, etc., is used
as a substrate material, since a coefficient of thermal
expansion of the organic polymeric material greatly differs
from that of silicon which is the material of the wafer, and
hence there is a problem that when a burn-in test is conducted,
a positional shift between the bump and
