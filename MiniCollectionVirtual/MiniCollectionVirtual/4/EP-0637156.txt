<ABSTRACT>
A memory interface system (100) is utilized for directing the storage of data messages 
received by an ARINC 629 terminal controller (200), wherein the terminal controller is 

coupled to a serial data bus (10) for receiving data messages consisting of a plurality of 
words wherein the first received word is a label word representative of the origin of said 

data message, and subsequent words thereof are data words. The terminal controller (200) 
includes a last word received register (202) for the last received word, and an error register 

(204) which stores data transmission/reception error information. The memory interface 
system comprising a first-in first-out memory means (400), means (120) for cooperating 

with the terminal controller for reading the last word data register and for storing the data 
word, being the contents of said last word data register, into said memory; and means (130) 

for reading the error register subsequent to reading the last word of the data message stored 
in the last word register, and for storing the error word, being the contents of said error 

register, into the memory; and means (110) for associating with each of the label words, 
data words, and error words stored in said memory a tag word in which the tag word 

identifies each stored word therein as being a selected one of the label words, data words, 
and error words.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a memory interface system for serial data
transmitter/receiver systems.The operation of aircraft relies heavily on many electrical avionic subsystems for
successful flight missions. These electrical subsystems include, among others, flight
management, navigation, auto-pilot, global positioning systems, landing systems, fuel
quantity systems, and the like. Many of these electrical subsystems require communications
therebetween, and some sensing subsystems may be located remote from the processing
subsystems. Since many of these subsystems may be provided by different manufacturers,
standards have been defined for the transfer of data messages on data buses that are wired
throughout the aircraft. One such standard is the ARINC (Aeronautical Radio
Incorporated) 629 Standard.The ARINC 629 Standard is such that each data message consists of a plurality of
data words of fixed length, i.e., a fixed number of bits. Further, the data message format
always consists of a label word, which indicates which subsystem transmitted the data
message, followed by one or more data words. The ARINC 629 standard requires that
each word be 16 bits and be transmitted at a fixed frequency.In order to further define some commonality among avionics equipment suppliers,
the ARINC 629 standard defines the bus and a Terminal Controller which is coupled to the
bus for receiving data message from the bus or transmitting data message onto the bus. The
ARINC 629 Terminal Controller is configured to have a known set of registers,
input/output control signals, read/write control signals, and address/data lines, all of which
are clearly defined so that avionic equipment suppliers may work together. From EP 0 482 963 A2 an error display system is known which uses two FIFO memories,
one for storing communication data and the other one mainly for storing error display data.Furthermore, EP 0 429 055 A2 discloses a circuit for forming blocks from serially received
information with bits serving to indicate the type of information (data or control). An object of the present invention is to provide a memory interface system for
effectively managing the flow of information from the terminal controller to a memory
device for both the terminal controller receive mode and the terminal controller transmit
mode. This object is achieved according to the characterizing features of the independent
claims.In the present invention, a memory interface system is utilized for directing
the storage of data messages received by an
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for use in an aircraft for directing storage of messages received from a
plurality of aircraft subsystems over a data bus (10) to a subsystem memory (400),

comprising:

terminal controller means (200) cooperating with said data bus (10) and said
subsystem memory (400) for receiving and transmitting said messages; and
a memory interface system (100) connected between the terminal controller (200) and
the subsystem memory (400) wherein the memory interface system arbitrates the data
bus (10) between the terminal controller (200) and the subsystem memory (400) and
associates with each of said messages a tag word having a tag bit identifying them as
label words, data words or error words, and
wherein the subsystem memory is a first-in-first out memory means (400) which stores
the messages along with the corresponding specific tag words identifying with its tag

bits:

a) the subsystem from which the data originated,
b) the data itself from said subsystem, and
c) the error information associated with said data.
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said memory
interface system (100) includes a terminal monitor block (110), a read/write control

block (120) and a bus arbitration block (130).
