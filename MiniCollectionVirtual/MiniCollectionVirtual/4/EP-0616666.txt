<ABSTRACT>
A brake pad (10; 20; 30; 40; 50; 60; 70; 80; 90) has its backing plate (24; 32; 36; 42; 54; 86; 96) flexible in regions thereof which are adjacent to the leading and trailing edges (16; 18) of a block (12) of friction material carried on the backing plate. This flexibility reduces thermal stress so that cracking is less likely. The flexibility may be achieved by a reduction in thickness which may be achieved by chamfers (28), steps (34; 38; 66; 68; 92) or grooves (44; 64; 82).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a brake pad for a 
disc brake. Conventionally, a brake pad for a disc brake 
(as known for example from FR-A-2 151 841) comprises 
a block of friction material having a contact surface 
arranged to be brought into engagement with the moving 
member so that frictional forces between the contact 
surface and the member cause the member to decelerate. The 
contact surface is generally planar or slightly curved. 
The brake pad also comprises a backing plate on which the 
block of friction material is carried. The block may be 
mounted directly on the backing plate or there may be a 
thin underlayer between the block and the backing plate to 
assist adherence and to reduce thermal conduction. The 
backing plate has to withstand considerable reaction 
forces. The backing plate, therefore, has to be of sturdy 
construction. The increased demands upon brake performance in recent 
years have resulted in brake pads operating under thermal 
and mechanical loads which are very close to the limit of 
modern materials technology. When braking from high speeds 
in a short time interval, disc temperature can reach over 
600Â°C. These high temperatures induce severe thermal 
stresses in the brake pad which can cause the material of 
the pad to crack. It is found that cracking most often 
occurs at the leading or trailing edge of the block, 
relative to the direction of movement of the moving member  
 
past the brake pad, and at the interface between the block 
and the backing plate or the block and the underlayer. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
brake pad in which the possibility of cracking due to 
thermal stresses is reduced. The invention provides a brake pad for a disc brake 
suitable for use in braking a moving member, the brake pad 
comprising a block of friction material having a contact 
surface arranged to be brought into engagement with the 
moving member, the contact surface extending between a 
leading edge of the block, relative to the direction of 
movement of the moving member past the brake pad, and a 
trailing edge of the block, the brake pad also comprising 
a backing plate on which the block of friction material is 
carried, the backing plate extending generally parallel to 
the contact surface of the block, characterised in that the 
backing plate is substantially rigid in a central region 
thereof which supports a central region of the block and is 
flexible in edge regions thereof which support the block 
adjacent to its leading and trailing

brake suitable for use in braking a moving member, the 

brake pad comprising a block of friction material 
(12;52;88;98) having a contact surface (14) arranged 

to be brought into engagement with the moving member, 
the contact surface extending between
 a leading edge 
of the block (16;56), relative to the direction of 

movement of the moving member past the brake pad, and 
a trailing edge of the block (18;58), the brake pad 

also comprising a backing plate (24;32;36;42;54;86;96) 
on which the block of friction material is carried, 

the backing plate extending generally parallel to the 
contact surface of the block, characterised in that 

the backing plate (24;32;36;42;54;86;96) is substantially rigid in a central 
region thereof which supports a central region of the 

block (12;52;88;98) and is flexible in edge regions thereof which 
support the block adjacent to its leading and trailing 

edges (16;56;18;58). 
A brake pad according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the flexibility of the edge regions of the 

backing plate is achieved by a reduction in thickness 
of the backing plate in said edge regions.

that the central region of the backing plate is of 

substantially uniform thickness. 
A brake pad according to either one of Claims 2 and 3, 
characterised in that the reduced thickness of the 

backing plate (24) is provided by chamfers (28) on the 
surface of the backing plate away from the block.  

 
A brake pad according to either one of Claims 2 and 3, 
characterised in that the reduced thickness of the 

backing plate is provided by grooves (44;64;82) in the 
backing plate (42;54;86). 
A brake pad according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that the grooves (82) are in the surface of the 

backing plate facing the block and the grooves contain 
material of the block (88). 
A brake pad according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that the grooves (82) have re-entrant side walls (89). 
A brake pad according to either one of Claims 2 and 3, 
characterised in that the reduced thickness of the 

backing plate is provided by steps (34;38;66;68;92) in 
the backing plate (32;36;54;96). 
A brake pad according to Claim 8, characterised in 
that the steps (66) each have a curved profile when 

viewed in plan view. 
A brake pad according to either one of Claims 8 and 9, 
characterised in that steps have inclined faces
