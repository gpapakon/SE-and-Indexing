<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of ligand receptor
assays, including immunoassays, for the detection of selected
metabolites of benzodiazepines in a fluid sample.
More particularly, this invention relates to methods for
the synthesis of novel benzodiazepine derivatives and
protein and polypeptide benzodiazepine derivative conjugates
and labels for use in the preparation of antibodies
to benzodiazepine metabolites and for use in the immunoassay
process.The benzodiazepines are a class of drugs which possess
sedative and tranquilizing properties. The benzodiazepines
are used clinically to treat a variety of ailments,
including depression, anxiety, insomnia and muscle
spasms. The class of benzodiazepines include alprazolam,
bromazepam, clonazepam, diazepam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam,
halazepam, lorazepam, medazepam, nitrazepam, oxazepam,
prazepam, quazepam, temazepam and triazolam. The
abuse of benzodiazepines has prompted a need to monitor
the concentration in urine. Benzodiazepines are metabolized
to a variety of derivatives and the majority of
the metabolites are excreted in the urine as glucuronides,
for example, see Clin. Pharm. Ther. 19, 443 (1976), Arz.
Forsch. 22, 687 (1972) and Clin. Pharm. Ther. 20, 329
(1976).The preparation of antibodies to benzodiazepine metabolites
requires the synthesis of a benzodiazepine derivative
in order to covalently attach the derivative to an
antigenic polypeptide or protein. In addition, the benzodiazepine 
derivative is covalently attached to various
polypeptides, proteins or labels for use in screening
antibodies and in the immunoassay process. The benzodiazepine
derivative should mimic the structure of the
benzodiazepine metabolite sought to be measured. Therefore,
the selection and synthesis of the types of benzodiazepine
derivatives for covalent attachment to proteins,
polypeptides or labels is critical. In addition, the benzodiazepine
derivatives need to be stable and soluble in
an aqueous solution.Benzodiazepine compounds and conjugates for immunization
and immunoassay have been described in U.S. Pat.
Nos. 4,046,636, 4,083,948, 4,243,654 and 4,869,895.The present invention is directed to novel benzodiazepine
derivatives which are synthesized for the covalent
attachment to antigens (proteins or polypeptides) for the
preparation of antibodies to the benzodiazepine metabolites.
The resulting novel antigens may be used for the
production of antibodies using standard methods. Once
generated, the antibodies and the novel derivatives which
are covalently attached to
