<ABSTRACT>
Cross cuts for forming the ends of a tab (70) on a 
sheet (28), for example a glue tab on a corrugated 

paperboard container blank, are performed by independent 
rotary cutter units (56, 58; 134, 136). Each cutter 

unit has a spirally convoluted blade (84, 88; 142, 144) 
which, as it rotates, cuts progressively inwards from an 

outside edge of the sheet towards an opposite outside 
edge. As the sheet is conveyed along, a downstream 

cutter unit (58; 136) cuts the leading end of the tab, 
and an upstream cutter unit (56; 134) cuts the trailing 

end. After each cut, the cutter remains at rest with 
its blade in an inoperative position out of the path of 

any oncoming sheet. A sensor (60) senses the next 
oncoming sheet and initiates the cutting via a computer 

(64). These rotary cutters mitigate skewing of the 
sheets while being cut.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to cutting tabs on 
sheets, and particularly relates to cutting glue tabs 
(also called stitch tabs) on container blanks, particularly 
container blanks of corrugated paperboard. When manufacturing container blanks from paperboard 
sheets, a glue or stitch tab may be formed at one end of 
the container blank. This is done in a rotary slotter 
section by performing slotting operations on the container 
blank and at the same time making transverse cuts 
at the ends of the tab using cross-cut knives. Examples 
of such slotting operations are disclosed in US Patents 
3,540,357 and 4,725,261, and the use of cross-cut knives 
is also disclosed in US Patent 4,725,261. One disadvantage found with using cross-cut knives is 
that for various reasons the cross-cut is not always a 
clean cut, so that scrap pieces inadvertently remain 
connected to the cut container blank by portions of 
uncut material. Another disadvantage is the need to 
periodically adjust the depth of cut of the cross-cut 
knife due to anvil wear and also change in board 
thickness. The present invention is concerned with providing a new 
approach for making the cross-cuts when producing tabs.  
 It has been noticed that as a cross-cut knife is 
set deeper, for example to compensate for wear of the 
resilient anvil cover against which the knife cuts, the 
container blank tends to become slightly skewed as it 
leaves the rotary slotter section. This is because the 
pitch diameter of the knife has increased with the 
deeper settings so causing one side of the sheet to be 
moved faster than the other side. It has been noticed 
that the blank may in this way be skewed through as much 
as 1Â½ degrees. Such skewing is a disadvantage for the 
accurary of further downstream processing, for exmaple 
gluing and folding. A feature of the present invention is to replace 
the cross-cut knife by a rotary cutter. This has the 
advantage that the cutter does not need to cut against 
and so wear an anvil surface, and has the further advantage 
of mitigating skewing of the sheets whilst being 
cut. Accordingly, there is provided an apparatus for 
forming tabs on corrugated paperboard sheets having side 
edges, said apparatus comprising a conveyor for conveying 
the sheets in a forward direction and slotter means 
for forming slots in said sheets extending in said 
forward direction, said apparatus 
further comprising 
first and second cutters rotatable about first and 
second axes, respectively; first and second motors drivingly

Apparatus for forming tabs (70) on corrugated 
paperboard sheets (28) having side edges, said apparatus 

comprising a conveyor (46) for conveying the sheets in a 
forward direction, slotter means for forming slots 

(66, 74) in said sheets extending in said forward direction, 
and at least one cutter for making a transverse cut extending 

from a side edge of the sheet to a slot, 
characterised in that said apparatus further 

comprises 

a second cutter, said 
first and second cutters (56, 58; 142, 144) being rotatable 
about first and second axes, respectively; 
first and second motors (76) drivingly connected to 
said first and second cutters, respectively, for independent 

rotation of said cutters; 
said cutters being spaced apart in said forward 
direction 

and being disposed 
adjacent one side of said conveyor, 

downstream of the slotter means with respect to said forward 
direction; 
each cutter having a cutting edge (122) curved 
about the respective axis of that cutter; 
each cutter having an inoperative position in which 
the cutting edge is spaced from a passing sheet being 

conveyed by said conveyor; 
rotation of each cutter from the inoperative position 
bringing the cutting edge into engagement with an 

outside edge of the passing sheet, further rotation of 
this cutter moving the cutting edge through the passing 

sheet in a direction transverse to said forward direction 
towards said slot (66, 74) to progressively cut one 

end of an edge tab being formed on the passing sheet, 
and further rotation of this cutter removing the cutting 

edge from the passing sheet; and
