<ABSTRACT>
A packet synchronization technique, in a synchronous optical packet 
switch, which delays received packets (on time axis 5a) to ensure that there is only 

one packet per local time slot (on time axis 5b). The packets are of a time duration τ 
which is equal to or less than one-half the duration of the local time slot (e.g. 

FRAME 5) of the optical switch. Each packet received at an optical switch is 
delayed an interval of nτ where n=0, 1 or 2.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical packet switched 
data/voice communication systems. In particular, it is 
directed to a method and apparatus to continuously 
synchronize the packet arrival times at the inputs of a 
synchronously operated optical packet switch with local 
time slots. In wide area communication networks, because of 
the relatively large uncertainty and considerable changes 
in the optical signal propagation delay, the packet arrival 
times must be continuously synchronized at the inputs of a 
synchronously-operated packet switch. One example of such 
an optical switch is described in IEE Electronic Letters, 
13th August 1992 and is titled 'Staggering Switch': An 
Almost-all Optical Packet Switch,by Z. Haas, which is 
incorporated by reference herein. Previously proposed schemes to provide such 
packet synchronization rely on a plurality of delay devices 
located at the input to the optical packet switch. Each 
device provides a delay which is a fractional part of a 
packet transmission time, so that substantially any value 
of required delay may be generated to compensate for the 
difference between the packet arrival time and the 
beginning of a local time slot in the switch. Such delay 
devices are typically fabricated using fiber delay lines in 
combination with 2x2 Lithium Niobate optical modules such 
as Type Y-35-8771 manufactured by the GEC-Marcone Company 
of Baddow Chelmsford, Essex England.  The problem with the above synchronization scheme 
is the resulting relatively large power penalty incurred 
due to the multiple coupling loss between the optical 
modules and the optical fiber delay lines(i.e., the optical 
signal travels several times in and out of the Lithium 
Niobate wafers.) Accordingly, there is a need for a technique to 
continuously synchronize the optical packet arrival times 
with the local time slots of a synchronously operated 
optical packet switch and that results in a minimum power 
penalty and cost. The instant invention overcomes the foregoing 
problem by receiving a stream of packets, each having a 
time duration of τ, which is equal to or less than half the 
duration of the local time slot of the optical packet 
switch; determining any packet delays required to adjust 
the incoming packet stream to a single packet per local 
time slot; and delaying selected packets to form a packet 
stream having one packet per local time slot based upon the 
delays established by the determining step. Additionally, each packet is delayed nτ where 
n=0,1 or 2 based upon
