<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns a working vehicle, comprising 
gear shaft which is put in gear box (28) and rotates in 

association with change of gear lever (35), a couple of left 
and right sliders, which are designed to slide on the gear 

shaft along its axial line, a couple of left and right speed 
changing means (26,27) which are linked to said left and 

right sliders and used to drive left and right crawlers, handle 
(32) which is provided to said gearbox (28) so as to freely 

rotate and main slider which is slid by rotating said handle 
and thereby makes said sliders slide, characterized in that said gear 

shaft and said left and right sliders are moved in one body by 
manipulating said gear lever (35) in order that said speed 

changing means (26,27) may be switched to direct to the same 
direction at the same time and make said crawlers go straight 

forward or backward and that either one of said left and right 
sliders slid by said main slider (53) is put in such position 

by turning said handle (32) as to stop or to move said one of said 
crawlers in the reverse direction to turn said working vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a steering mechanism for a working
vehicle such as combine according to the preamble of claim 1.In these combines, left and right crawlers
are respectively driven by left and right hydrostatic transmission
device (hereinafter abbreviated to HST) and so operation
is conducted by using two independent left and right operating
levers linked to each trunnion lever of HST.These combines are difficult to smoothly
conduct operation and poor in maneuverability because speed
changing operation and turning operation have to be made by
using the two levers.In the Japanese patent
publication No. sho 40-18576 is
disclosed a working vehicle,
in which speed changing
means such as accelerating pedal and turning means such as a
steering wheel are respectively linked to each trunnion lever
of each HST on the left. The right and forward/backward
movement is made by using said speed changing means and left/right
turning movement is made by using said turning means in order to
conduct operation smoothly.However, in the conventional art many kinds of cams are
needed to link the speed changing means and the turning means
to each gear lever on both sides and accordingly many kinds 
of bevel gears are needed to couple various means with the cams.The invention provides an improved steering mechanism
comprising the features of claim 1.
Because of this
invention, the left and the right sliders and the main
slider can be incorporated in around the gear shaft in
a compact manner and the gear lever and the handle can
functionally be arranged around the gear shaft and thereby
the structure of the operating section can be simplified and
the production cost can now be easily reduced. Further embodiments of the invention are outlined in the further
dependent claims.Other features and advantages of this invention will be
apparent from the following description taken in connection
with the accompanying drawing wherein:
Fig. 1 is a side view of the combine.Fig. 2 is a plan of the combine.Fig. 3 is a rear view of operating section of the combine. Fig. 4 is a partially cutaway rear view of the operating
section.Fig. 5 is a cross-sectional bottom view of the operating
section.Fig. 6 is a cross-sectional side view of the operating
section taken from the left.Fig. 7 is another cross-sectional side view of the operating
section taken from the left.Fig. 8 is an illustration showing the gear lever
and the handle in the neutral position. (At this time
the combine is not working.)Fig. 9 is an illustration showing the

<CLAIMS>
Steering mechanism for a working vehicle with crawlers, such as a combiner
comprising


a gear shaft (33) housed in a gearbox (28) and rotating in accordance with a
change of a gear lever (35),
a couple of left and right sliders (58, 59) which are designed to slide on the
gear shaft (33) along its axial line,
a couple of left and right speed changing means (26, 27) which are linked to
said left and right sliders (58, 59) and used to drive left and right crawlers,
a handle (32) which is provided to said gearbox (28) so as to freely rotate
and
a main slider (53) which is slid by rotating said handle and thereby makes
said sliders (58, 59) slide, 
characterized in that
said gear shaft (33) and said left and right sliders (58, 59) are moved in one
body by manipulating said gear lever (35) in order to switch said speed changing

means (26, 27) such that said speed changing means direct to the same direction at
the same time and make said crawlers go straight forward or backward and
either one of said left and right sliders (58, 59) slid by said main slider (53)
is put in such a position by turning said handle (32) as to stop said one of said

crawlers or as to move it in the reverse direction to turn said working vehicle.
Steering mechanism as claimed in Claim 1, wherein a hulling machine (4) provided
with a cylinder (5) and a grain sorter (7) is mounted on a vehicle floor (1) and

thereby substantially forms a combine to crop grains.
Steering mechanism as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said handle (32) is
substantially formed in circular shape.
Steering mechanism as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said left and right crawlers are
moved by oil pressure means.
Steering mechanism as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the direction of changing
motion generated by said gear lever (35) is straight line.
Steering mechanism as claimed in Claim 4, wherein the speed of said left and right
crawlers are changed by said circular handle (32) and said gear lever (35).
