<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a measuring and 
transmitter device comprising a mediating 

element (1) and a transmitter frame (2) 
attached to it and provided with a 

surface pressure transmitter (7). The 
transmitter is connected to a pressure 

sensor (6) comprised in the device, and 
the sensor (6) is connected to a pressure 

space (4) closed with a protective film 
(3). The device is provided with a 

temperature sensor (8) connected to an 
element which understands the output 

signal given by the temperature sensor, 
e.g. a temperature transmitter (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a measuring and transmitter 
device as defined in the preamble of claim 1, designed for 
use in industrial measuring technology. Among the devices used for industrial measuring purposes in 
previously known technology there are devices which measure 
the surface pressure and transmit the measurement results in 
the form of signals for further processing, e.g. to a system 
control unit. Previously known are also separate temperature 
measuring devices which transmit the results as signals for 
further processing. Certain known devices for the measurement 
of surface pressure have some internal functions, e.g. 
for the calibration of the meter, measurement of temperature. 
However, these devices do not output the temperature 
value for further processing. A problem with the use of two separate measuring devices is 
that they occupy a larger space and separate measurement 
connections to the object under measurement have to be 
provided for each device. In addition, expensive cables and 
piping have to be installed separately for each measuring 
device. Previously known temperature sensors are also in 
direct contact with the substance under measurement, so that 
e.g. in the case of corrosive substances, temperature 
sensors specially designed for this purpose have to be used, 
which are very expensive (3000 - 8000Fmk / unit). Another 
drawback with current temperature measuring devices is that, 
due to their construction, they are slow in operation. The combined diaphragm temperature / surface pressure 
measuring device of the present invention is designed to 
eliminate the drawbacks referred to above and to achieve a 
reliable, simple and cheap device for the measurement, of the 
temperature and surface pressure of an object and for 
transmitting the measurement results for further processing. 
The transmitter device of the invention is characterized by  
 
what is presented in the characterization part of claim 1. 
The invention has the advantage that only one measurement 
connection to the object under measurement, e.g. a 
container, is needed, instead of two as required before. 
This reduces the costs and the space needed. Further savings 
can be achieved in the costs of the ducts and cabling. The 
temperature sensor is placed under a protective diaphragm, 
ensuring a long useful life and a good resistance to 
corrosive substances. A further advantage as compared to 
traditional temperature sensors is that the device of the 
invention is faster in operation. In the
