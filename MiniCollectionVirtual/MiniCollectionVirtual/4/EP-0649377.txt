<ABSTRACT>
The adjustable, insulating push or track rod for railway points has two sleeves (2) fitted together in the manner of a turnbuckle, each of which has an internal thread (1). Track or push-rod sections (9) are screwed into the internal thread (1) so that the rotation of the turnbuckle permits the axial adjustment of the track or push-rod. The sleeves (2) are interconnected via insulating intermediate layers (4) using at least one off-centre locating pin (5) or connecting bolt, thus making it possible to maintain the correct rotation position even in case of lengthy operation and vibrations.

<CLAIMS>
An adjustable insulating slide or track rod for rail 
switches, in the central zone of which two bushes (2) with 

internal threads (1) are provided, in which sections (8) of 
the slide rods are screwed, characterized in that the bushes 

(2), on their end faces facing each other and facing away from 
the free insertion ends (3) for screwing in said sections, 

comprise at least one torsion locking pin (5) or screw bolt 
(12, 19) arranged outside the axis of the bushes (2) and that 

the bushes (2) are connected with each other by means of the 
at least one eccentric screw bolt (12, 19) or a further 

connecting pin (6), optionally upon insertion of a central 
piece (16, 20) for the engagement of an actuation rod, 

insulating inserts (4) being interposed on the end faces of 
the bushes (2) and in the region of the screw bolts (12, 19) 

or in the region of the torsion locking pin (5) and said 
further connecting pin (6). 
An adjustable insulating slide or track rod for rail 
switches according to claim 1, characterized in that the 

connecting pin (6) is formed by a substantially axial screw 
bolt. 
An adjustable insulating slide or track rod for rail 
switches according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that 

the bushes (2) each comprise a flange (11, 18) that faces away 
from the insertion end (3) and through which at least one of 

the screw bolts (12, 19) passes with insulating inserts (4) 
interposed. 
An adjustable insulating slide or track rod for rail 
switches according to claims 1, 2 and 3, characterized in that 

the sections (8) screwed in the bushes (2) each comprise at 
least one axial groove (9) or a radial pin bore for the 

engagement of a torsion locking means (10).  
 
An adjustable insulating slide or track rod for rail 
switches according to claim 3 or claims 3 and 4, characterized 

in that the screw bolts (12, 19) are screwed against the 
insulating inserts (4) with pressure distribution discs (15) 

interposed.
