<ABSTRACT>
A method of welding two plates (1) together along a 
substantially vertical weld line between the two plates 

involves the use of a weld pool support device (8) having 
internally formed channels (13, 14, 15) through which flows 

a liquid coolant maintained considerably below ambient 
temperature by a cooling device (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method according to the
preamble of claim 1 for joining two metal plates together by
welding.Large spherical tanks are usually used for transportation
and storing of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The temperature
of LNG is about -163°C, which places special demands on the
choice of material for an LNG-tank and on the technique used
for producing such a tank. The diameter of a typical
spherical LNG-tank is from 30 m to 40 m. Such a tank is
preferably made of welded aluminium plates, because the
extremely low temperature of the contents of the tank does not
have a deleterious effect on the strength properties of
aluminium. The thickness of aluminium plates used for
manufacturing LNG-tanks of this kind is usually from about 25
mm to about 60 mm. The invention relates in particular to
joining such aluminium plates through welding, but the
invention is also applicable to other welding operations of
a similar kind, e.g. to the welding of titanium plates.The material of weldable plates suitable for the
production of an LNG-tank is, for instance, according to the
DIN-standard AlMg4,5Mn, which corresponds to the U.S. ASTM-standard
plate A-5083. The application of the invention is,
however, not limited to these plate qualities, since the
invention can generally be applied to weldable aluminium
plates or other metal plates having substantially similar
weldability properties, e.g. titanium plates.The invention relates to the production of a
welded joint having a substantially vertical component. This means a weld
line that is vertically disposed to such an extent, that the molten
metal (or weld pool) has a tendency to run out of the weld
groove due to gravity. This tendency appears of course most
strongly when the weld groove extends vertically, but may also 
appear to some extent complicating the welding operation, when
the angle of the weld groove to the horizontal is as small as
30°.According to the known art of vertical welding, a cooled
weld pool support device is used, the dam member of which
moves upwards in the direction of the weld groove as the
welding proceeds in the same upward direction. When welding
steel, a piece of copper has usually been used as the dam
member in a weld pool support device, but when welding
aluminium difficulties have occurred, because a copper dam
member readily adheres to melted aluminium. For solving this
problem it has been suggested to use as the dam member a
piece of graphite, see US-A-3 585 343 or Welding Journal,
July 1973, pages 440-448. However, a

<CLAIMS>
A method for joining two metal plates (1, 1),
by means of a one-sided weld

(31) filling a weld groove (5) having a substantially vertical component
and being formed

between the two plates (1, 1), which joining is produced by using a
dam member (8) of a weld pool support device moving in the

direction of the weld groove (5), a
liquid coolant (21) being passed through a cooling duct (13-15)

in the dam member (8), 
characterised in that
 the plates (1, 1) are of
aluminium or of other metal having substantially similar weldability

properties to aluminium and in that the temperature of coolant fed to the
duct (13-15) is maintained substantially below ambient

temperature by means of a cooling device (12).
A method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the temperature of the liquid coolant (21) fed to the cooling
duct (13-15) of the weld pool support device is kept within

the range of +8°C to -20°C, preferably within the range of 0°C
to -10°C.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2,

characterised in that
 the dam member (8) of the weld pool
support device is dimensioned to have a cooled portion with

a length (L) in the direction of the weld groove (5) of from
7 to 12 cm, preferably from 8 to 10 cm.
A method according to any one preceding claim,
particularly when welding aluminium plates, 
characterised in
that
 the cooling of the dam member (8) is so controlled, that
cooling of the edge areas of the plates (1) at the sides of

the weld groove (5) is limited so that the temperature of the
said edge areas during continuous welding exceeds 100°C.
A method according to any one preceding claim,

characterised in that
 the dam member (8) is made of a material
which has little tendency to adhere to liquid weld material

(16).
A method according to claim 5, 
characterised in that
 
the said material of the dam member (8) has a wear resistance

in use permitting a weld joint length of at least 50 metres
before replacement is required.
A method according to claim 5 or claim 6,

characterised in that
 the said material of the dam member (8)
is copper, aluminium, stainless steel or a ceramic material.
A method according to any one preceding claim,

characterised in that
 a moving or stationary backing (6, 7)
is used at the root side of the weld groove (5), preferably

a stationary ceramic backing.
A method according to any one preceding claim,

characterised in that
 the welding speed is controlled to be
