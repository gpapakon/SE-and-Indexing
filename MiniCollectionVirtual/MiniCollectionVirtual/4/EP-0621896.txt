<DESCRIPTION>
 PEROXIDASE PRODUCING PLANT CELL CULTURESFIELD OF INVENTIONThis invention relates to a process for the production of peroxidase enzymes from plant cell cultures, and specific isoenzymes isolated therefrom.BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ARTPeroxidase enzymes catalyse a host of reactions in which hydrogen peroxide is a specific oxidising agent and a wide range of substrates act as electron donors. They are widely used as enzyme labelled reagents in diagnostic, e.g. ELISA, kits, and in other biologically based molecular detection systems, but also find utility in other industries, such as in paper recycling, chemical and waste water treatment, and in detergents and bleaching agents.Peroxidase enzymes are widely distributed in nature and are produced by a wide variety of plant species. At the present time however, the chief commercial source is horseradish. In the commercial production of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) the horseradish roots are harvested and the sprouted roots are minced mechanically in water to form a starting material. From this, peroxidase. is purified by a series of ammonium sulphate and ethanol precipitations. To obtain high purity enzyme, conventional chromatographic techniques are employed. Unfortunately, this process leads to large quantities of waste tissue and problems arise with dispersing of waste. Not only this but there is a significant irreversible loss of enzyme activity resulting from the precipitations with ethanol and ammonium sulphate which are used to extract the enzyme from the tissue.In Internationa] Patent Application, Publication No. 091/10729, plant cell suspension cultures are described which produce an extra¬ cellular peroxidase in high yield and which therefore provide a convenient source of peroxidase which is not subject to the foregoing recovery problems. These are suspension cultures of peroxidase producing cells of plants of the genus Acer, and especially root cell cultures of Acer pseudoplatanus.Various other sources have been suggested in the literature for the commercial production of peroxidase. For example, radish plant 

 cell cultures have been suggested as a source of extra-cellular peroxidase (Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture, 1989, 18:321-327) but the yields and specific activity of the product enzyme are low.It has also been suggested that calli cultured from various plant species can be used as a source for the production of peroxidase, but callus culture Is inherently incapable of large scale commercial production. Such suggestions are contained in

CLAIMS
1. A process for the production of peroxidase enzyme which comprises establishing a plant cell culture of peroxidase-producing cells from a plant of the species
Theobroma cacao
Coleus blumei
Silene alba in suspension in a culture medium capable of supporting the growth of the peroxidase-producing plant cells, continuing the culture of said cells in suspension in the culture medium with the concomitant accumulation of extra-cellular and/or intra-cellular peroxidase, and recovering the accumulated peroxidase.
2. A process according to claim 1, wherein the cell suspension culture is a suspension culture of Theobroma cacao pod tissue cells.
3. A process according to claim 1, wherein the cell suspension culture is a suspension culture of Coleus blumei leaf tissue cells.
4. A process according to claim 1, wherein the cell suspension culture is a suspension culture of Silene alba epicotyl tissue cells.
5. A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the culture medium used in the suspension culture of the peroxidase- producing plant cells contains as a carbon source from 1 to 15% by weight fructose, glucose or sucrose.
6. A process according to claim 5, wherein there is used a.s the carbon-containing source a carbohydrate waste material containing glucose, sucrose, and/or fructose.
7. A process according to claim 6, wherein the glucose, sucrose, and/or fructose containing waste is a confectionery waste.
8. A process according to any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the cells are cultured in the suspension culture under aerobic conditions 


at a temperature of about 25°C and at an initial pH in the range 5.6 to 5.8.
9. A process according to any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the plant cell culture is a T. cacao or C. blumei culture and wherein the product peroxidase is extra-cellular peroxidase recovered from the culture as a crude extract by separating the supernatant peroxidase- containing liquor from the culture and concentrating the liquor to produce a crude peroxidase containing concentrate.
10. A process according to claim 9, wherein following the suspension culture, the cultured plant cell tissue is separated from the culture medium to provide a supernatant liquor containing the accumulated extra-cellular peroxidase, recovering the extra-cellular peroxidase from the supernatant liquor and further processing the separated plant cell tissue of T. cacao or C. bl umei to recover intra-cellular peroxidase as a separate product.
11. A process according to any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the plant cell culture is a Silene a lba culture and wherein the product intra-cellular peroxidase is recovered from the culture by separating the cultured plant tissue from the culture medium, disrupting the cells in the separated plant, cell tissue, and extracting the intra-cel lular peroxidase from the disrupted plant cells.
