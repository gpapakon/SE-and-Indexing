<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to finish compositions for use with 
synthetic filaments and relates more particularly to a neat oil finish composition 
and synthetic filaments coated with such composition. Known neat oil finishes typically used for polyamide and polyester 
yarns contain high percentages of nonionic surfactants, e.g., 30 weight percent, 
which provide good dissipation of electrostatic charge, filament bundle cohesion. 
and desirable wetting properties to the yarn. Unfortunately, such high 
percentages of nonionic surfactants in the finish can be disadvantageous since 
they generally increase the finish viscosity which makes uniform application of 
finish difficult. Also, nonionic surfactants increase the propensity of the finish to 
undergo oxidative degradation and to fume when exposed to heat. The 
disadvantages become particularly apparent when such finishes are used as "spin 
finishes" in the manufacture of high tenacity polyamide and polyester industrial 
yarns where high draw ratios and high temperatures are used. The presence of nonionic surfactants in neat oil finishes can also 
cause problems when a yarn is to be used in woven fabrics. Nonionic surfactants 
are sometime incompatible with size, especially polyacrylic acid size, and thus 
nonionic surfactant can cause sizing, weaving, and scouring problems for fabric 
makers. The US-A-3704160 describes a finish for nylon yarns comprising a mineral oil, a tri-fatty acid ester and a fattt acid salt. To improve application uniformity of high viscosity neat oil finishes 
containing nonionic surfactants, low molecular weight diluents like mineral spirits 
are sometimes added to reduce finish viscosity. However, these diluents can 
introduce fire and explosion hazards since they increase finish fuming and may 
also cause health and environmental problems. Using higher finish application 
temperatures to reduce viscosity is not a desirable practice with finishes 
containing high percentages of nonionic surfactants since increased thermal 
degradation will result. If it is attempted to reduce the nonionic surfactant 
content to a lower percentage, e.g., 5 weight percent by substitution with 
additional lubricant, the resulting finish provides poor electrostatic protection 
during yarn manufacture and in end-use processing. The invention provides a lubricating finish composition and synthetic 
filaments coated with the composition. The composition of the invention 
comprises: 
about 80 to about 99 weight percent lubricant; and  
 about 1 to
