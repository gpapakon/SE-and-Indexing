<ABSTRACT>
For an HVLP paint spray gun, an improved suction feed 
nozzle assembly includes a fluid tip (11) and an air cap 

(12). The air cap (12) directs an annular flow of 
atomization air around a fluid discharge orifice (16) 

formed by a tubular portion (17) on the fluid tip (11) to 
aspirate fluid from the orifice (16) and to atomize the 

fluid. The air cap (12) also directs pattern shaping air 
at the atomized paint. According to one feature of the 

invention, the spacing of the pattern shaping air orifices 
(32, 33) from the fluid discharge orifice (16) is made 

sufficiently great that undue turbulence is not induced in 
the atomization air in the aspiration zone (30) to maximize 

the fluid flow rate. According to a second feature of the 
invention, the fluid orifice (16) in the fluid tip (11) 

has a straight cylindrical portion (16') and an expanding 
conical section (41, Fig. 3) connecting the cylindrical 

section (16') to an annular flat front face (18) of the 
tubular portion (17) of the fluid tip (11). The flat 

portion (18) of the front face on the tubular portion is 
kept to a minimum to increase the particle distribution 

uniformity of the atomized paint and to assist this a 
chamfer (42, Fig. 3) may be included.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to spray guns for atomizing
liquid and more particularly to an improved nozzle assembly
for a suction feed high volume low pressure (HVLP) air
atomization paint spray gun.One class of spray gun uses pressurized air for
atomizing liquid such as paint and for shaping the envelope
or pattern of the atomized liquid as it is discharged from
a nozzle assembly on the gun. Air atomization spray guns
broadly fall into two classes. One type of air atomization
spray gun uses a low volume flow of high pressure air for
atomization and pattern shaping. The air pressure
typically may be on the order of from 40 psi (2.81 Kg/cm2)
to as high as 100 psi (7.03 Kg/cm2), or more. The spray
gun includes a nozzle assembly having a fluid tip and an
air cap. The fluid tip has an orifice which discharges the
fluid for atomization. The air cap forms an annular air
discharge orifice which surrounds the fluid orifice and
also has a pair of horns which discharge air from orifices
for shaping the envelope of the atomized fluid into a flat,
fan shaped pattern. The nozzle assembly receives the fluid
and compressed air and discharges and atomizes the fluid.
The fluid may be delivered to the nozzle assembly through
pressure feed, gravity feed or suction feed. For many
applications, the fluid is drawn through the nozzle
assembly by suction produced by the flow of high pressure
air. The air is discharged through an annulus which
surrounds a fluid orifice, creating a suction at the
orifice. The suction is sufficient to draw the fluid, such
as paint, from a cup attached to the gun through supply
passages in the gun to the orifice where it is discharged
and atomized. For many applications, such as automotive
refinishing, suction feed is preferred because of the ease
of use and clean up. The equipment is much easier to clean
for colour change, for example, than pressure feed 
equipment which requires a pressure pot and hoses
connecting the pressure pot to the spray gun.A second type of air atomization paint spray gun uses
a relatively high volume flow of low pressure air for
atomization and pattern shaping. The lower air pressure
imparts a lower velocity to the atomized paint. The lower
velocity droplets are less prone to be deflected from the
surface being coated. Consequently, the transfer
efficiency is increased and less paint may be dispersed
into the environment. The pressure of the atomization and
pattern shaping air used for HVLP spay guns is generally
less than about 15 psi (1.05 Kg/cm2) and often is kept to
less
