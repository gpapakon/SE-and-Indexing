<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an elastomeric composition based on polyether materials which, in the fully vulcanised and polymerised form, contains from 0.1 to 15 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one hydrophilising agent from the group consisting of hydrophilic silicone oils, fluorinated hydrocarbons, ethylene oxide-propylene oxide block copolymers, fatty alcohol derivatives, alkylphenol derivatives, fatty amines, amine oxides, fatty acid glycol and glycerol derivatives, fatty acids and fatty acid monoesters. The composition is suitable as a dental moulding compound and, in the fully polymerised state, has a permanently good flow capability (low contact angle) and unchanged dimensional stability, even after repeated disinfection.
