<ABSTRACT>
A heat exchanger includes a pair of tanks (14,15) and 
a heat exchanger core comprising a plurality of upstream 

and downstream heat-transfer tubes (11,31,41) and fin units 
(12). 

The downstream tubes have a cross sectional area 
which is greater than that of the upstream tubes for 

preventing the downstream heat-transfer tubes from becoming 
clogged by corrosion products which are grown in the 

upstream tubes. Further, a filter device (24) may be 
disposed in the tank for filtering out corrosion products 

before they enter the downstream tubes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a heat exchanger for use as
an automotive heat exchanger such as radiators, heaters and
condensers and more particularly to an improvement in a
structure of tubes and filter which is resistant to
corrosion.The conventional fin and tube exchanger, such as for
a motor vehicle engine radiator, is well known in the prior
art. For example, US-A-4,645,000 discloses a basic
construction of a heat exchanger.Generally, automotive heat exchangers typically
comprise an assembly of cooling medium conduit pipes, and
interposed cooling fins. The cooling medium flows into and
out from the heat exchanger core through inlet and outlet
pipes.Referring to Figures 1 and 2 of the accompanying
drawings, upper tank 14 is partitioned into two chambers,
such as inlet chamber 17 and outlet chamber 18 by wall
portion 16 of upper tank 14. Inlet chamber 17 and outlet
chamber 18 are respectively provided with inlet pipe 19 and
outlet pipe 20 by which the radiator is connected in the
engine cooling system. Heat exchanger core 13 comprises a
plurality of parallel flat shaped tubes 11 which are joined
at their opposite ends to headers 28 and 30 which in turn
join heat exchanger 13 to upper tank 14 and lower tank 15.
Lower tank 15 includes chamber 21 therein. By a flat tube
is meant a tube having a cross section which is elongate
and which has substantially parallel longer sides. A
plurality of corrugated fin units 12 are provided to
alternate with the tubes 11 such that each corrugated fin
unit 12 is positioned between two tubes 11. Corrugated fin
units 12 are brazed to flat tubes 11 for permanent
assembly.The cooling medium is introduced from inlet pipe 19
into inlet chamber 17 of upper tank 14, and flows through
heat exchanger core 13, down through the upstream tubes 11, 
and reaches chamber 21 of lower tank 15, from where it
flows back to the outlet pipe 20 up through downstream
tubes 11 and outlet chamber 18 of upper tank 14. When the
cooling medium is transferred through heat exchanger core
13, the heat energy of the cooling medium is exchanged with
air which flows from front to rear through heat exchanger
core 13 in accordance with air flow Q. The cooling medium,
which has performed heat-exchange with air flow Q, flows
into the outlet chamber 18 of tank 14 and is reintroduced
into the engine coolant circuit. The tubes 11 and fin
units 12 are made of high heat conductivity material, such
as aluminum alloy. Also, upper tank 14 and lower tank 15
are made of aluminum or aluminum alloy.Generally, inner

<CLAIMS>
A heat exchanger comprising first (14) and second (15)
tanks, the first tank including a partition (16) therein

for dividing the first tank into a first chamber (17) and
a second chamber (18), the first chamber including an inlet

pipe fitting (19) for providing a path of ingress of a heat
transfer medium, and the second chamber including an outlet

pipe fitting (20) for providing a path of egress of a heat
transfer medium; a plurality of first tubes (11) each

connected at one end to the first chamber of the first tank
and at the other end to the second tank, a plurality of

second tubes (31,41) each connected at one end to the
second chamber of the first tank and at the other end to

the second tank; and a plurality of corrugated fin units
attached to and positioned between the tubes; characterised

in that each of the second tubes (31,41) has an internal
passage sectional area which is greater than that of each

of the first tubes (11) to prevent the second tubes from
becoming clogged by corrosion products which grow, in use,

in the heat exchanger.
A heat exchanger according to claim 1, wherein the
first and second tubes (11,31,41) are flat tubes.
