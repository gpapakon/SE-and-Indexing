<ABSTRACT>
Provided on the side of a distal end of an insertion part 
(21) are an observation ultrasonic transducer (53) for 

acquiring an ultrasonic image and a therapeutic ultrasonic 
transducer (50) for outputting a therapeutic ultrasonic 

wave so as to be focused. Positioning or the like between 
the observation ultrasonic transducer (53) and the 

therapeutic ultrasonic transducer (50) is so conducted that 
a focusing point at which the therapeutic ultrasonic wave 

is focused is locked to a predetermined position within a 
scanning range of the observation ultrasonic wave. If the 

position of the focusing point is locked whereby a lesion 
part to be treated is set to a predetermined position on an 

ultrasonic image, it is necessarily possible to conduct the 
position setting to the focusing point. It is also made 

possible to confirm the position of the lesion part and to 
acoustically observe a state of the lesion part during 

irradiation of the therapeutic ultrasonic wave.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic
diagnosis and therapy (treatment) system having
an ultrasonic probe which is inserted into a body
cavity or coelom to emit an observation ultrasonic
wave and a therapeutic ultrasonic wave.Generally, various kinds of ultrasonic therapy
apparatuses have conventionally been proposed in
which ultrasonic pulses are repeatedly sent or
transmitted into organism tissues from ultrasonic
transducers, echoes of the ultrasonic pulses which
are reflected from the organism tissues are received
by the ultrasonic transducers which are
provided integrally with each other or separately
from each other, and a direction in which the
ultrasonic pulses are transmitted and received is
gradually shifted, whereby information which is collected
from a plurality of directions within the organism
is displayed as visible ultrasonic tomographic
or ultrasonogram images.It is general that such ultrasonic diagnosis apparatuses
are due to external ultrasonic probes.However, probes which are combined with endoscopes,
and internal ultrasonic probes such as
ultrasonic probes having thin diameters, coelom
ultrasonic probes inserted into the coelom, or the
like, are also used widely.Meanwhile, various kinds of ultrasonic therapy
apparatuses have also been proposed such as
calculus crushing apparatuses, ultrasonic thermotherapy
apparatuses or the like in which various
kinds of therapies are conducted by focusing the
ultrasonic wave. Of these therapy apparatuses due
to the ultrasonic wave, there have been ultrasonic
high-temperature therapy apparatuses in which organism
tissues such as cancer or carcinoma tissues
or the like are instantaneously cauterized in
high temperature and are treated by the focused
ultrasonic wave of high strength or intensity.As the ultrasonic high-temperature therapy apparatuses,
an arrangement has been known which
is provided with an internal probe building therein
an ultrasonic transducer of relatively small size,
and which is inserted into a rectum to treat a
hypertrophied prostate, in addition to an arrangement
in which ultrasonic wave is focused onto an
object part from an external applicator which has
an ultrasonic transducer wide in opening, in order
to acquire a focused ultrasonic wave having high
intensity.For example, disclosed in PCT WO93/16641 is
an arrangement in which an ultrasonic transducer
which is capable of conducting linear and sector
scanning is arranged at a distal end of a probe,
and an ultrasonic wave having weak energy is
scanned to acquire an
