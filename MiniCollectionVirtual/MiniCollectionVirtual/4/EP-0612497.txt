<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus is comprised of a scanning optical system unit (2) including a laser 
source (21) and a laser scanner (23), a base unit (3) containing a synchronizing circuit 

(31 to 33) for the laser scanner and a video monitor (4), an image processing unit (5), 
and a laser light source unit (6) which can be detachably attached to the optical system 

unit. The laser light source unit (6) is optically connected with the scanning optical 
system (2) through optical fiber (65). For observing the anterior chamber (11) as well as 

the fundus (12) of an eye, an optional auxiliary optical system unit (202) can be attached 
to the main optical system unit (2). Also, when units are connected by optical fiber, a 

further configuration can be used to suppress the effect of beam power variation noise 
produced by reverse propagation of light from a fiber end face or other cause.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ophthalmic examination apparatus, and 
more particularly to an ophthalmic examination apparatus whereby the fundus 
of an eye is scanned two-dimensionally by a laser beam from a laser light source, 
and light reflecting from the eye is detected by a light receiving element and 
photoelectrically converted to obtain image information of a prescribed part of 
the eye. Recent years have seen the development of electronic ophthalmological devices 
that utilize laser scanning. Such instruments are called scanning laser ophthalmoscopes 
(which herein shall also be abbreviated to "SLO"), and particular 
progress has been made with such devices for use in observing the eye fundus 
(described, for example, in JP-A-62-117524, USP 4764005; and JP-A-64-58237, 
USP 4854692). With a conventional SLO, by scanning the eye fundus two-dimensionally by 
a laser beam passing through the center of the pupil, and receiving, photoelectrically 
converting and amplifying the light reflected by the eye fundus from a 
larger area around the pupil, it is possible to display a real-time video image of  
 
the eye fundus on a TV monitor with a low brightness and a high S/N ratio. 
Also, the effect of non-essential scattered light can be screened out by using an 
optical system with a confocal arrangement system, thereby producing a marked 
improvement in fundus image resolution and contrast. Among other advantages provided by these new instruments that are producing 
major innovations in ophthalmology are that they make it possible to 
decrease greatly the amount of fluorescent agent that needs to be administered 
for fluorescent angiography of the eye fundus, and by modulating the scanning 
laser beam it becomes possible to examine visual function while observing the eye 
fundus, and the monochromatic properties of lasers make it possible to carry out 
precision examination of the fundus, and real-time three-dimensional observation 
(cf. JP-A-1-113605, USP 4900144, Optics Communications, vol. 87, 1992, pp 9 - 
14). To obtain the large amounts of information required for diagnoses using such 
ophthalmic examination apparatus, it is desirable to prepare a plurality of laser 
light sources of different wavelengths. For example, infrared, red, yellow, green, 
blue and other wavelengths are used for different image observation applications, 
as well as, in the case of angiography, fluorescein angiography (FAG) and indo-cyanine 
green angiography (ICG) and the like. To meet the advanced needs of
