<ABSTRACT>
The throttle valve, for a fluid flow and especially a dispersion of solids, has a fluid feed to the passage surface which imposes a rotary flow component in relation to the main flow direction line and around it. Also claimed is a feed system operation, where the fluid flow is given a rotary component round the main flow line, for a throttling cross-section with a rotary symmetrical shape.

<CLAIMS>
Valve or throttle device (1) in a pipe for feeding a 

pulp slurry to the flow box of a paper machine with 
the following features: 


1.1 a substantially rotationally symmetric hollow 
member with liquid flowing through it is provided; 
1.2 the hollow member has a variable, substantially 
rotationally symmetric passage face; 
1.3 a main flow direction is provided in the hollow 
member, which runs substantially axially to the 

longitudinal axis of the hollow member; 
 
characterised by the following feature:
 
1.4 a liquid supply to the passage face is provided 

in such a manner that with respect to the main flow 
direction, a rotational component around the main flow 

direction is added to the liquid. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
supply to the valve device is provided tangentially 

into a cylindrical area. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that the surfaces of the valve wetted 

with fluid are provided at least partially with a 
structure which causes a rotation of the liquid. 
Process for the reduction of the blocking tendency of 
a valve or a throttle device with rotationally 

symmetric throttle cross-section in a pipe for feeding 
a pulp slurry to the flow box of a paper machine, 

characterised in that a rotation component relative to 
the main flow direction is added to the liquid in the 

region of the throttle cross-section.
