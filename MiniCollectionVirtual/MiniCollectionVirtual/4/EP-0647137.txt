 Glycine Receptor Antagonists and the Use ThereofThe present invention was made with U.S. government support. Accordingly, the U.S. government has certain rights in the invention.Cross Reference to Related ApplicationsThis is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application Serial No. 07/995,167, filed December 22, 1992, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application Serial No. 07/903,080, filed June 22, 1992, the contents of each of which are fully incorporated by reference herein.Field of the InventionThe present invention is in the field of medicinal chemistry. The present invention relates to compounds having high affinity for the glycine binding site, lacking PCP side effects and which cross the blood brain barrier at high levels. In particular, the present invention relates to novel 1,4- dihydroquinoxaline-2,3-diones and their use to treat or prevent neuronal degeneration associated with ischemia, pathophysiologic conditions associated with neuronal degeneration, convulsions, anxiety chronic pain and to induce anesthesia. The invention also relates to certain highly soluble ammonium salts of l,4-dihydroquinoxaline-2,3-diones.Background of the InventionGlutamate is thought to be the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. There are three major subtypes of glutamate receptors in the CNS. These are commonly referred to as kainate, AMPA and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (Watkins and Olverman, Trends in Neurosci. 7:265-272 (1987)). NMDA receptors are found in the membranes of virtually every neuron in the brain. NMDA receptors are ligand-gated cation channels that allow Na+, K+ and Ca+ + to permeate when they are activated by glutamate or aspartate (non-selective, endogenous agonists) or by NMDA (a selective, synthetic agonist) (Wong and Kemp, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 37:401- 425 (1991)). 

 Glutamate alone cannot activate the NMDA receptor. In order to become activated by glutamate, the NMDA receptor channel must first bind glycine at a specific, high affinity glycine binding site which is separate from the glutamate/NMDA binding site on the receptor protein (Johnson and Ascher, Nature 325:329-331 (1987)). Glycine is therefore an obligatory co- agonist at the NMDA receptor/channel complex (Kemp, J.A., et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:6547-6550 (1988)).Besides the binding sites for glutamate/NMDA and glycine, the NMDA receptor carries a number of other functionally important binding sites. These include binding sites for Mg+ +, Zn+ + , polyamines, arachidonic acid and
