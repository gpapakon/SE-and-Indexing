<ABSTRACT>
A thermoelectic system (10) comprises a thermoelectric module (12), volume defining manifolds (14) attached to opposed faces of the module (12) and pump means (44) for circulating fluid from remote heat exchangers (46) to the manifolds (14). There is also described a novel submersible pump (78) having stationary electric coil means (84) and rotatable magnet housing (86) and associated impeller (88). A magnet means (92) in the magnet housing (86) is disposed about the electric coil means (84). Still further, there is described a novel thermoelectric module containing a row of spaced thermocouples (130). Adjacent thermocouples (130)  are connected together by blocks (144) of electrically conductive material said blocks being relatively large in size and immersed in a pumped, electrically non-conductive fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermoelectric
system.It is known to use thermoelectric modules in refrigeration
systems. A thermoelectric module is a known type of heat
pump in which the passage of an electric current through
the module causes one side of the module to be cooled and
the opposite side of the module to be heated.Thermoelectric modules are also known as Peltier modules or
thermoelectric heat pumps.Previously known refrigeration units containing
thermoelectric modules have comprised aluminium heat sinks
which are clamped tightly to each side of the
thermoelectric module, creating a thermoelectric assembly.When an electric current is applied to the module, heat is
pumped from one side to the other side. Initially, when a
current is first applied to the thermoelectric module the
temperature differential between the two sides is at a
minimum. Under these conditions the thermoelectric
assembly offers efficient performance. However, as the
refrigerator approaches its desired internal temperature
there is an increased temperature difference between the
two sides. Under these conditions the thermoelectric
assembly becomes less efficient as a heat pump.When the thermoelectric module is configured as a heat pump
a conventional thermoelectric assembly must always have an 
electric current applied to it in order to maintain a
temperature differential across the device. If this
current is removed then heat will flow through the assembly
in such a manner as to re-establish thermal equilibrium.Therefore, in practice, conventional thermoelectric
assemblies consume power simply to maintain a temperature
difference across the assembly. This is very wasteful of
energy.In practice, conventional thermoelectric assemblies also
suffer from the effects of thermal impedances which occur
at the boundaries of the thermoelectric module and the heat
sinks. This requires great care and expense in the
manufacture of thermoelectric assemblies to ensure the
minimisation of these boundary effects.Some thermoelectric assemblies have two small
thermoelectric modules sandwiched between heat sinks rather
than a single thermoelectric module in an effort to try and
increase the surface area contact with die heat sinks.However, the structural and design limitations of
thermoelectric modules forced on them by the clamping
forces of solid heat sinks and cost, restrict the modules
themselves to being necessarily small, clearly preventing
large area thermal contact.Also, for the same reasons, electrical connectors between P
& N
