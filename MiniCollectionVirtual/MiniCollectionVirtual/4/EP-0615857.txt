<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to recording sheets, such as transparency materials,
filled plastics, papers, and the like. More specifically, the present invention is directed to
recording sheets particularly suitable for use in ink jet printing processes.Recording sheets suitable for use in ink jet printing are known as, for example, in
disclosed US-A-4,740,420; US-A-4,576,867; US-A-4,446,174; US-A-4,830,911; US-A-4,554,181;
US-A-4,877,680; US-A-5,212,008; US-A-5,223,338 and European Patent Application
0,439,363 A1.JP-A-62-019,483 describes compositions for use in ink jet recording papers comprising
certain quaternary ammonium compounds. GB-A-2,147,003 describes a recording medium for
ink jet printing containing a water-soluble salt of a metal having a valence of from 2 to 4 and a
cationic organic material. GB-A-2,134,129 describes an aqueous ink comprising a humectant
and a water-soluble dye.Copending European Applications EP-A-615,855 and EP-A-615,856 of even date to the present respectively
describe recording sheets comprising a pyridinium and/or piperazine/piperazinium compound,
and a material selected from the group consisting of tetrazolium, indolinium, imidazole and
imidazolinium compounds.While known compositions and processes are suitable for their intended purposes, a
need remains for improved recording sheets. In addition, there is a need for improved
recording sheets suitable for use in ink jet printing processes. Further, a need remains for
recording sheets for ink jet printing with a high degree of waterfastness. Additionally, there is
a need for paper recording sheets for ink jet printing with reduced showthrough of the images
on the side of the paper opposite to that printed. There is also a need for recording sheets for
ink jet printing with enhanced optical density.It is an object of the present invention to provide recording sheets which strive to
meet the above needs.Accordingly, the present invention provides a recording sheet in accordance with the
appended claims to a recording sheet. Another aspect of the invention is the provision of a
process which comprises applying an aqueous recording liquid to a recording sheet in
accordance with the appended claims to a recording sheet. A further aspect of the present
invention is the provision of a printing process comprising incorporating into an ink jet printing
apparatus a recording sheet in accordance with the appended claims.In accordance with an embodiment of the invention there is provided a recording
sheet which consists
