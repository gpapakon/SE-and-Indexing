<ABSTRACT>
To make a spherical bearing (10), an outer ring (12) is formed 
with counterbores (20, 22) at the ends thereof, disposed along 

a common axis (24) and separated by a radially inwardly 
extending keel portion (26). A polymer liner (16, 18) is 

inserted into each end of the outer ring (12) into abutment 
with the keel portion, the polymer liners being preformed with 

spherically concave inner surfaces (38, 40) conforming to a 
ball part (14) entrapped therebetween. Portions (48) of the 

outer ring are then deformed by upset forming over portion 
(46) of the polymer liners to lock the polymer liners in 

position. An electrical sensor can be provided for indicating 
failure of the polymer liners.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to self-aligning spherical 
bearings and, more particularly, to heavy duty spherical 
bearings with solid liners as used, for example, in rod end 
bearings. Generally, rod end bearings used in aircraft controls and 
similar applications require a self-aligning configuration 
with a solid liner of bronze, brass, polymer, fabric or other 
bearing material supported by a close fitting steel housing. 
Snap-together assemblies utilising resilient liners of nylon 
or similar material result in spherical bearings that do not 
provide sufficient strength for these demanding applications 
and do not satisfy the rigorous military specifications. One method currently used to fabricate heavy duty spherical 
bearings employs a machined cylindrical sleeve with radially 
inwardly extending end flanges restricting the end opening of 
the entrance face. After a liner is manually positioned on 
the recessed cylindrical surface between the flanges, the 
sleeve is coined around the ball part of the bearing in a 
large press, causing the liner to conform, generally, to the 
shape of the ball part. The bearing is then cured and 
machined. Such fabrication requires a long process time, 24 hours or 
more including the curing step, and often results in an 
irregular liner which may trap dirt and have non-uniform 
contact points, affecting performance. The required tedious 
labour and large press add to the high cost of manufacture. 
And, due to the distortion caused during coining of the  
 
sleeve, the length and diameter of the sleeve must be machined 
to the sleeve's finished dimensions after assembly of the 
bearing. From US-A-3 801 395 there is known a method of making 
a spherical bearing whereby two cup-shaped liners of weldable plastic 
material are inserted between an outer ring and a ball part. A liner 
is inserted into each end of the outer ring into abutment with 
each other and then welded together. The liners have preformed 
spherically concave inner surfaces conforming to the ball part entrapped 
therebetween. To lock the liners in position the outer ring may be caulked. From GB-A-568 117 there is known a method of making a spherical bearing 
whereby an outer ring is formed with counterbores at the ends thereof, 
disposed along a common axis and separated by a radially inwardly extending keel 
portion, which engages a ball part. The spaces at opposite sides of the 
keel portion are filled with molten bearing material. According to the present invention, there is provided a method

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a spherical bearing (10), the method 
comprising the steps of: 


forming an outer ring (12) with counterbores (20, 22) at 
the ends thereof, disposed along a common axis and separated 

by a radially inwardly extending keel portion (26); 
providing a ball part (14) having a spherical diameter 
less than the inner diameter of the keel portion (26) such 

that a clearance results between the ball part and the keel 
portion; 
inserting a polymer liner (16, 18) into each end of the 
outer ring into abutment with the keel portion, the polymer 

liners having preformed spherically concave inner surfaces 
(38, 40) conforming to the ball part entrapped therebetween; 

and 
deforming a portion (42) of the outer ring over a portion 
of the polymer liners (16, 18) to lock the polymer liners in 

position. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the polymer liners 
are preformed with a bevelled outer surface (46) and wherein 

the deformed portion (48) of the outer ring overlies the 
bevelled outer surface to lock the polymer liners in position. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the deforming 
of the outer ring is effected by upset forming, whereby 

circumferentially spaced material of the outer ring (12) is 
moved radially inwardly while the overall length and diameter 

of the outer ring remain substantially unchanged. 
A method according to claim 3, wherein the upset forming 
is effected by engagement with discrete portions of wedge-shaped  

 
tooling (44) including angled surfaces for moving 

portions (48) of the outer ring radially inwardly. 
A method according to claim 4, wherein the angled 
surfaces of the wedge-shaped tooling (44) form an angle 

between 15 and 45 degrees with respect to the axis (24) of the 
outer ring. 
A method according to claim 4 or 5, wherein the wedge-shaped 
tooling engages substantially half the circumference of 

the outer ring, the other half of the circumference being 
distributed in even increments between the discrete portions 

of wedge-shaped tooling (44). 
A method according to claim 6, wherein the number of 
discrete portions of wedge-shaped tooling (44) is between 

eight and thirty two. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the polymer liners (16, 18) include a filler material 

for reducing friction between the ball part (14) and the 
polymer liners. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, 

wherein the polymer liners (16, 18) include a filler material 
for providing reinforcement. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
further comprising the step of connecting sensing means to the 

outer ring and the ball portion such that electrical 
conductivity between the outer ring and the ball portion is 

sensed to indicate wear or failure of the polymer liners.
