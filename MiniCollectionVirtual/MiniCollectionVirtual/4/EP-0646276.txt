<ABSTRACT>
A sealed vented surge arrester and method of manufacture is described wherein the valve elements are held under compressive loading while strength members including a moisture sealing void filling compound are pressed fit from the sides of the unit with a shed applied over it. The design achieves all the desirable features of tubular strength members with an ease of manufacture from utilizing half-shell or more members which can be applied from the sides along the longitudinal axis of the valve elements during manufacture to provide better void filling between the structural members and the valve elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to electrical distribution
networks. More specifically, this application relates to an
electrical surge arrester that is used in electrical distribution
networks.In electrical distribution networks, it is necessary to
protect equipment connected along the distribution network from
damage which may be introduced by power or voltage surges from
lightning or voltage overloads. This is often accomplished by the
insertion into the system of a surge arrester. A surge arrester is an
electrical device whose function is to protect electrical power
distribution systems from overvoltages due to lightning, switching
surges, and temporary power frequency overvoltages due to line-to-ground
faults, ferroesonance, etc. Present day surge arresters
generally consist of voltage non-linear elements, commonly called
valve elements, enclosed in one or more housings made of
porcelain, fiber-reinforced materials, polymeric resins, and the
like. Said voltage non-linear elements may include spark gaps
alone and/or in combination with valve elements made of silicone
carbide (SiC), zinc oxide (ZnO), titanium dioxide, or strontium
titanate. Recent surge arrester designs utilize ZnO valve elements
without spark gaps, so-called gapless arresters.The surge arrester is commonly attached to the
electrical distribution system in a parallel configuration, with one
end. of the device connected to the electrical system and the other
end connected to ground. At normal system voltages, the surge
arrester is electrically resistant to current flow. However, if an
overvoltage condition occurs, the surge arrester becomes
conductive and shunts the surge energy to ground while
"clamping" or limiting the voltage to an acceptable value. In this 
manner, the surge arrester protects other equipment attached to the system from the
possibly deleterious effects of overvoltage surges.Surge arresters were originally made with heavy porcelain housings that
made them cumbersome to install and subject to breakage. Later improvements
included semi-conductive varistor valve elements such as doped ZnO, polymeric
plastic sheds or housings and composite internal structural members. Recent
advances in surge arrester design and products have focused on primarily four areas.Polymeric structural members and housings have been used outside the valve
and terminal elements. These housings are less heavy than prior ceramic housings
and also less fragile. However, these housings are not vented and problems with
explosive fragmentation can
