<ABSTRACT>
In order to make the manufacture of galvanised bar elements (10), for example for space frameworks, more economical, the individual parts of the bar elements (10), namely the hollow bar (11) and the end pieces (12), are galvanised before they are connected. The ring welds between the galvanised parts (11, 12) are made by laser welding. On account of the high energy density of the laser welding beam and the narrow ring welds (18) formed in the process, a zinc coating (24) fed by the zinc coatings (22) of the adjacent parts (11, 12) forms across each ring-weld surface (25) in the course of the welding operation, so that, after the welding operations, the bar element (10) is also provided with an anti-corrosion zinc coating (24) over the ring-weld surfaces (25).

<CLAIMS>
Process for producing galvanised rod elements, 
particularly for frameworks or room frameworks, in which 

end pieces, preferably frustum-shaped end pieces, are 
attached to the ends of a hollow rod by means of annular 

welds, wherein the annular welds are produced while 
rotating the hollow rod and the end pieces in axially 

fixed, for example clamped, and mutually centred 
positions, characterised in that the hollow rod (11) and 

the end pieces (12) for each rod element (10) are 
galvanised as individual parts and then the annular welds 

(18) are produced between the galvanised hollow rod (11) 
and the galvanised end pieces (12) by laser welding, so 

that in the course of the welding process, a zinc coating 
(24) supplied by the partially molten zinc coatings (22) 

of the neighbouring parts (11, 12) to be joined is 
automatically formed over each annular weld seam surface 

(25). 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the hollow rod (11) and the end pieces (12) of the rod 

elements (10) are provided with a zinc coating (22) which 
has a thickness in the region of 80 Âµ.
