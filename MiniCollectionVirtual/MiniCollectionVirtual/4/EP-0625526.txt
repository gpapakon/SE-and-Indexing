<ABSTRACT>
In a process of (co)polymerization in aqueous emulsion of 
fluorinated olefinic monomers it is added to the reaction 

medium a microemulsion of fluoropolyoxyalkylenes having 
hydrogenated end groups and/or hydrogenated repetitive 

units. A remarkable reduction in the reaction induction 
period is so obtained, with formation of a product with 

improved mechanical properties and higher thermal and 
chemical resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a (co)polymerization 
process in aqueous emulsion of fluorinated olefinic 
monomers. More particularly the present invention relates to 
a (co)polymerization process in aqueous emulsion of 
fluorinated olefinic monomers, in which microemulsions of 
fluoropolyoxyalkylenes having hydrogenated end groups and/or 
hydrogenated repetitive units are employed. It is known that in the (co)polymerization in aqueous 
emulsion of fluorinated olefinic monomers, the addition of 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) increases the reaction rate (see 
for instance the patent US-A-3,635,926). A remarkable improvement has been obtained by the 
process described in the patent US-A-4,864,006, where the 
fluorinated monomers are (co)polymerized in the presence of 
perfluoropolyoxyalkylenes prepared in the form of aqueous 
microemulsion. Besides avoiding the use of CFC, which 
deplete the ozone layer of the atmosphere, such a process 
allows to obtain a further increase in the reaction rate, in 
particular for the least reactive monomers, and a reduction  
 
of the working pressure. The Applicant has now surprisingly found that, in 
(co)polymerization processes in aqueous emulsion of 
fluorinated olefinic monomers, by adding to the reaction 
medium an aqueous microemulsion of a fluoropolyoxyalkylene 
having hydrogenated end groups and/or hydrogenated 
repetitive units, it is possible to obtain a remarkable 
reduction in the induction period compared with the same 
process carried out in the presence of a microemulsion of 
perfluoropolyoxyalkylenes. By induction period it is meant 
the time running from the moment when the addition of the 
radical initiator begins to the moment when the actual 
starting of the (co)polymerization is observed, as pointed 
out by a monomer consumption. This fact constitutes a remarkable advantage both for 
the quality of the final product and for the industrial 
application of the process. In fact, a short induction 
period minimizes the formation of low molecular weights, 
which, as known, mainly occurs in the first phase of the 
reaction, and then leads to a narrower molecular weight 
distribution. As evidenced by the experiments carried out by 
the Applicant, the product obtained with the process object 
of the present invention is also characterized by a lower  
 
concentration of end groups deriving from the radical 
initiator and therefore by a higher thermal stability. 
Moreover, when operating with a discontinuous process, a 
lower induction period involves a
