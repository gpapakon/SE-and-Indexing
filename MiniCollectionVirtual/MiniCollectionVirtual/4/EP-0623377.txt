<ABSTRACT>
A filter insert is proposed for filtering the fresh air supplied to a motor vehicle interior. This filter insert is composed of a filter element folded in a zigzag shape and which is self-supporting, side strips coated with adhesive being provided on the end faces running on the left and on the right. Angle strips are arranged on the end faces running parallel to the folding, the first leg of which angle strips extends over at least three fold edges. The filter element is surrounded by a foamed plastic seal along the end faces.

Filter insert for filtering the fresh air supplied
to an automative vehicle interior, including a filter

element (10), which is folded in a zigzag manner and is
self-supporting, wherein lateral strips (11, 12), which are

coated with adhesive material, are provided on the end
faces, which extend on both sides, and angle strips (15,

16) are disposed on the end faces extending parallel to the
folding, the first portion (17, 18) of said angle strips

extending over at least three fold edges, and wherein
either a foam material seal (27) is provided, which extends

longitudinally of the end faces, or the lateral strips (11,
12) are bent-over at the upper side of the filter element

in the direction of the filter element and form a sealing
face, wherein the angle strips (15, 16) and the lateral

strips (11, 12) are produced from the material of the
filter element, and wherein the elements to be adhered to

the filter insert have a material thickness which is less
than or identical to the material thickness of the filter

element (10).
Filter insert according to claim 1, characterised
in that at least one reinforcing strip (13, 14) is adhered

to the upper side of the filter element, said strip being
produced from the material of the filter element and having

a material thickness which is less than or identical to the
material thickness of the filter element (10).
Filter insert according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the component parts (11, 12,

13, 14, 15, 16), which are to adhere to the filter element,
are provided with a thermally meltable or thermally

activatable adhesive.
Filter insert according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that, at the lateral regions, 

release tabs are secured on the filter tips by ultrasonics
or by means of adhesive agents.
Method of producing a filter insert according to
claim 1, wherein a filter paper is folded in a zigzag

manner to form a filter element (10), and the filter
element (10) is brought into contact, at its end faces,

with a lateral strip (11, 12), which is provided with
adhesive material on its end faces, this adhesive is

heated, and a compressive pressure is exerted upon the
lateral strips (11, 12) to join the lateral strips (11, 12)

to the filter element (10), wherein angle strips (15, 16),

which are also provided with hot-melt-type adhesive, are
subsequently disposed on the end faces, which extend

parallel to the folds of the filter element (10), upon
application of heat, and wherein either the end faces are

provided with a circumferential foam material seal (27) or
the lateral strips (11, 12) are bent-over at the upper

face of the filter element and connected to the filter
element (10).
