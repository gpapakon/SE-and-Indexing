<ABSTRACT>
An electrophotographic printer or copier with an illumination correcting device for the optical character generator (ZG) contains means, e.g. a filter (FT), to compensate for the wavelength-dependent light sensitivity of the charge image substrate (FL) by controlling the lighting energy of the lighting devices (LED) dependently upon the wavelength of the light emitted by them and the light sensitivity of the charge image substrate (FL). This prevents the formation of undesired colour differences in the form of stripes when colouring large areas.

Method for the character-dependent generation of 
charge images on a charge image carrier (FL) which 

exhibits a wavelength-dependent light sensitivity, in a 
printer or copier, via a character generator (ZG) having 

illuminating elements, the wavelengths of the light from 
the various illuminating elements (LED) on the character 

generator (ZG) scattering amongst one another, the method 
having the following features: 


a) registering the light energy from the illuminating 
elements with the aid of a photoelement (FE), 
b) registering the light energy from the illuminating 
elements with the aid of the same photoelement, a 

filter (FT) which simulates the wavelength-dependent 
sensitivity of the charge image carrier (FL) being 

arranged between the photoelement (FE) and the illuminating 
elements (LED), 
c) determining the ratio of the light energy from the 
illuminating elements, measured using the filter (FT), 

to the light energy measured without the filter, and 
storing corresponding relative valued (Z) assigned to 

the illuminating elements, 
d) if required, comparing the illuminating elements (LED) 
of the character generator (ZG) under prescribed 

standard parameters without the filter (FT), a specific 
light energy being assigned to each illuminating 

element, 
e) storing correction values which are assigned to the 
individual illuminating elements (LED) and characterize 

the specific light energies, 
f) exciting the illuminating elements in a  
 

character-dependent manner and fixing the light energy 
to be emitted as a function of the stored correction 

values, corrected by the relative values (Z). 
Method according to Claim 1, a standard filter 
being used as filter (FT) and a standard image carrier 

being used as charge image carrier, and each charge image 
carrier being assigned a specific correction value which 

describes its spectral sensitivity behaviour in relation 
to the standard image carrier and, as a function of the 

charge image carrier used, during the character-dependent 
excitation of the illuminating elements, the correction 

values being correspondingly adapted by means of the 
specific correction value.
