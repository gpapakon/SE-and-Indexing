<ABSTRACT>
A fusing device for fusing a toner image by passing a 
recording sheet carrying an unfused toner image by means of 

the torque of a heating roll through a nip portion between 
the rotating heating roll and a heat-resistant solid elastic 

member which is forced to contact the outer peripheral 
surface of the heating roll to form the nip portion. In the 

fusing device, the heat-resistant solid elastic member 
includes an elastic body penetrated with a liquid release 

agent, and a lease-agent penetration control film whose 
region which is used for covering the surface of the elastic 

body and corresponds to at least the nip portion is formed of 
a porous film.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fusing device for
use in equipment such as copying machines, facsimiles,
printers and the like making use of electrophotographic
processing.In copying machines utilizing electrophotographic
processing, unfused toner images formed on recording sheets
have to be fused to change them into permanent images and a
heat-fusing method for fusion-bonding the toner image on a
recording sheet by heat-fusing toner powder is widely in use
now.As a heat-fusing device, there is a known device
including a heating roll having a heater in a cylindrical
core bar and a heat-resistant plastic layer formed on the
outer peripheral surface of the core bar, and a pressure roll
which is forced to contact the heating roll and has a heat-resistant
elastic layer formed on the outer peripheral
surface of a cylindrical core bar. The device of the
aforesaid heating roll type is used for fusing by passing a
recording sheet carrying an unfused toner image through the
nip portion between both rolls. However, such a fusing device of the heating roll
type requires the heating roll and when the heating roll is
manufactured, expensive heat-resistant elastic material such
as silicone rubber, fluororubber or the like is used to form
the heat-resistant elastic layer. The problem is that
equipment cost is relatively high. Moreover, the contact
(nip portion) between the heat and pressure rolls ought to be
at least 4 to 10 mm wide to secure predetermined fusing
conditions. Consequently, it is necessary to set the roll
diameter on the large size or provide a loading mechanism for
applying a heavy load, for example, and the heat and pressure
rolls are hardly made compact; this naturally results in
large-sized and complicated devices.In order to solve the problems peculiar to the
aforesaid heating roll type fusing device, there has been
proposed a fusing device to which, in place of a pressure
roll, a heat-resistant solid elastic member is applied, the
elastic member semicircular in cross section being forced to
contact a heating roll (Japanese Utility Model Unexamined
Publication No. Sho. 63-62861). This fusing device is
advantageous in that a reduction in not only manufacturing
cost but also equipment size is feasible because the pressure
roll can be dispensed with.Notwithstanding, even the fusing device thus proposed
still leaves room for improvement in order to deal with
various demands growing every year for a reduction in 
equipment size and cost, and for an increase in performance
and so on.EP-A-0 291 081
