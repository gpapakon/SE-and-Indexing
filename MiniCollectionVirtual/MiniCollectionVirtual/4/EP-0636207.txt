<ABSTRACT>
An active noise cancellation muffler for automotive and industrial use as shown in the figure comprises a muffler chamber, an internal plate with an attached pipe mounted inside the muffler chamber dividing the muffler chamber into first and second chambers, a controller system including a linear motor/actuate, a motor/actuator controller and an error microphone for moving the partition plate in both directions (+/- DELTA  chi ) to change the relative sizes of the first and second chambers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for adaptive, multifrequency 
reactive attenuation of a muffler according to the 
introductory portion of claim 1 and to an adaptive, multifrequency 
reactive muffler system according to the introductory 
portion of claim 3. Active noise cancellation mufflers have been developed 
by Noise Cancellation Technologies, Inc. and are subject of 
WO 89/07701. This muffler system comprises a muffler having 
an ingress and an egress for the passage therethrough of exhaust 
gas, a microphone for detecting the noise at the egress 
of the muffler, a controller connected to the microphone and 
loudspeakers attached to the muffler which loudspeakers are 
controlled by the controller for active noise attenuation. It is object of the present invention to find a method 
and a muffler system which produces the desired results in a 
different way.  
 This object is achieved for the method by claim 1 and 
for the muffler system by claim 3. It has been found that, in certain applications, a double 
chambered muffler produces the desired result. It has 
been proved very effective with minimum loss of power and the 
length and thereby the relative sizes of the chambers can be 
varied by moving the partition between them. The invention and its objects will become readily apparent 
when reference is made to the accompanying drawings in 
which  
 
Fig. 1 is a plot of transmission loss against frequency based on the muffler view 
dimensions accompanying it.  Fig. 2 is general configuration of the double chamber muffler of this invention,  Fig. 3 is a plot of the transmission loss curve versus frequency, and  Fig. 4 shows the double chamber muffler with a movable partition. An expansion chamber geometry (Fig. 1), having a length "ℓ" and an abrupt 
change in cross-sectional area at each end provides Transmission Loss (TL) in the 
absence of a steady air flow by the Equation (1): 
ScCross sectional area of expansion chambers SdCross sectional area of duct  
 kℓExpansion Chamber length 
m = ScSdThe addition of a second chamber of different length permits each chamber to 
attenuate further the other's passband (Fig. 2). Transmission Loss of the two chambers 
can be approximately defined by Equation (2): 
Most passbands can be attenuated by making the inlet and outlet pipes protrude 
into each chamber. For a pipe intrusion of length (le), a series of narrow attenuation 
spikes occurs at the frequencies such that ℓe =  nλ / 4 =  nc / 4f (n integer number 1, 2, 3..). The Fig. (3) shows the general shape

Method for adaptive, mulfitfrequency reactive attentuation 
of a muffler having an ingress and an egress for the 

passage therethrough of exhaust gases comprising the steps of 

detecting the noise at the egress of the muffler by means 
of a microphone, 
analyzing the noise by means of an electronic controller, 
and 
controlling active noise attenuation means, 
 
characterized in that an adjustable partition provided with 

one or more apertures divides the muffler into a first chamber 
receiving the exhaust gases and a second chamber receiving 

exhaust gases from the first chamber through the partition 
and releasing the exhaust gases to the atmosphere, and 

in that during operation the position of the partition is adjusted 
by means of the controller for changing the relative 

sizes of the first chamber and the second chamber and thereby 
adaptively attenuating passbands of the exhaust gases. 
Method according claim 1, further characterized in that 
the electronic controller computes errors of attenuation and 

causes the partition to move to eliminate these errors.  
 
Adaptive, multifrequency reactive muffler system for 
carrying out the method of claim 1 comprising 


a muffler having an ingress and an egress for the passage 
therethrough of exhaust gases, 
a microphone for detecting the noise at the egress of the 
muffler, 
an electronic controller connected to the microphone, and 
means controlled by the controller for active noise attenuation, 
 
characterized in that the muffler between its ingress and 

egress comprises a first chamber and a second chamber separated 
from each other by means of a partition having one or 

more apertures which partition allows exhaust gases to pass 
from the first chamber to the second chamber to which partition 

motor means are connected which motor means are controlled 
by the controller for moving during operation the 

partition to change the relative sizes of the first and second 
chamber and thereby adaptively attenuating passbands of 

the exhaust gases. 
Muffler system according claim 3, further characterized 
in that the second chamber is longer than the first chamber 

and in that the partition is adjustable such that the second 
chamber has a length 1.1 times to 2.2 times as long as the 

first chamber.
