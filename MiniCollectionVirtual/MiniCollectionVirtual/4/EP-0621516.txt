<ABSTRACT>
A donor roll (40) for the conveyance of toner in a development system for an 
electrophotographic printer includes an outer surface (42) of ceramic. The ceramic has a 

suitable conductivity to facilitate a discharge time constant thereon of less than 600 
microseconds. The donor roll (40) is used in conjunction with an electrode structure (41) as 

used in scavengeless development.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrophotographic 
printing apparatus with scavengeless 
development. US-A-3,950,089 discloses a development apparatus in which a surface for the direct 
conveyance of electrically-conductive toner comprises a dielectric sheath of a thickness of 1-25 
mils, having a resistivity of 107 to 109 ohm-cm. US-A-4,034,709 discloses a development apparatus in which a surface for the direct 
conveyance of toner comprises styrene-butadiene, of a resistivity of 102 to 106 ohm-cm. US-A-4,774,541 discloses a development apparatus in which a surface for the direct 
conveyance of toner is doped with carbon black to a conductivity of 10-6 to 10-10 1/ohm-cm. US-A-5,245,392, discloses a phenolic resin coated on a donor roll. The use of phenolic 
resin coated donor rolls results in discharge time constants less than 300 microseconds. In the prior art, there are a few instances in which the physical properties of ceramics 
are exploited for various purposes relating to development of electrostatic latent images. US-A-4,544,828 discloses a heating device utilizing ceramic particles as a heat source 
and adapted for use as a fixing apparatus. US-A-4,893,151 discloses a single component image developing apparatus including a 
developing roller coated with a Chemical Vapor Deposition ceramic and an elastic blade coated 
with a ceramic, but not in a scavengeless development system. US-A-5,043,768 discloses a rotating release liquid applying device for a fuser 
including an outer porous ceramic material. According to the present invention there is provided a donor roll in accordance with 
appended claim 1. The present invention also provides an electrophotographic printing 
apparatus in accordance with appended claims 2 to 8. There is provided an apparatus for 
developing an electrostatic latent image. A housing defines a chamber for storing a supply of 
toner particles therein. A donor roll, with a ceramic outer coating, is mounted at least partially 
in the chamber of the housing to advance toner particles to the latent image. An electrode 
member is positioned in the space between the latent image and the donor roll, closely spaced 
from the ceramic coating of the donor roll and electrically biased to detach toner particles 
therefrom so as to form a toner powder cloud in the space between the electrode member and 
the latent image with detached toner particles from the toner cloud developing the latent 
image. There is provided an electrophotographic printing machine of the type having
