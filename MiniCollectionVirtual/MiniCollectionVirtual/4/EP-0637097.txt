<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a connection block for high transmission rates in telecommunications and data technology. The connection block 1 consists of a plastic housing 2 and of metallic insulation piercing terminal contact elements 10 which are inserted in pairs, in at least two parallel rows, into the housing 2 and have connected contact fingers 15 forming spring contacts 16. In order to reduce the capacitances between adjacent insulation piercing terminal contact elements 10 and between adjacent pairs of insulation piercing terminal contact elements 10, and thus to improve the crosstalk levels, the flat insulation piercing terminal contact elements 10 are formed only out of the base web 13 and the very narrow side webs 12 which enclose the contact slots 11 between them. The width of the contact fingers 15 is as small as possible.

<CLAIMS>
Terminal block (1) for high transmission rates in
telecommunications and data technology, comprising a

plastic housing (2) and contact fingers (15) which, with

spring contacts (16) will form metallic insulation-piercing
terminal contact elements (10) which are inserted,

in at least one row and in pairs, into the housing
(2),

characterized in that

the distance (D) between two adjacent pairs of insulation-piercing
terminal contact elements (10) is greater

than the distance (D) between two adjacent insulation-piercing
contact elements (10) in a pair, the flat

insulation-piercing terminal contact elements (10)
comprising a contact slot (11), two narrow side webs (12)

and a narrow side web (13) which connects these narrow
side webs (12) and has contact fingers (15) arranged

diametrically opposite, and having a supporting surface
(45) which is bent through 90Â° with respect to the

insulation-piercing terminal contact element (10) and
rests on supporting webs (21) on the housing (2) of the

terminal block (1).
Terminal block according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the distance (D) between the two insulation-piercing

terminal contact elements (10) in a pair is
about 3 mm and the distance between adjacent pairs is

about 9 to 10 mm.
Terminal block according to one of Claims 1 and
2, characterized in that the contact fingers (15) are

bent approximately at right angles inwards immediately 
adjacent to the base web (13) of the insulation-piercing

terminal contact elements (10), and in that the lower
part (4) of the housing (2) has supporting webs (21) as

an opposing bearing for the short insulation-piercing
terminal contact elements (10).
Terminal block according to Claim 3, characterized
in that the supporting webs (21) project over the

circumferential outer walls (23) of the lower part (4).
Terminal block according to one of Claims 3 or 4,
characterized in that the supporting webs (21) form a

continuous supporting wall (22).
Terminal block according to one of Claims 1 and
5, characterized in that the insulation-piercing terminal

contact elements (10) in one pair are arranged deeper in
the housing (32) than the insulation-piercing terminal

contact elements (10) in the opposite row and than the
two laterally adjacent pairs of insulation-piercing

terminal contact elements (10) in the same row, contact
fingers (15, 35) of different length being fitted.
Terminal block according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the insulation-piercing contact

elements (10) in a pair are arranged on the opposite tops
and bottoms (43, 44) of the housing (42).
Terminal block according to Claim 7, characterized
in that the upper part (43) and the lower part (44)

of the housing (42) are of identical design.
