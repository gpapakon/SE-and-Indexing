<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an application 
member for applying a coating material, such as a pressure 

sensitive adhesive (102), to a receiving surface, such as 
a paper substrate (104). The application member includes a 

cylindrical peripheral surface (108) and a plurality of 
spaced, discrete structures (115) projecting from the 

peripheral surface of the hub, whereby adhesive may be 
carried on and between the structures prior to being 

applied to the receiving surface. By varying the surface 
velocity of the application member relative to the 

velocity of the substrate, the characteristics of the 
adhesive layer applied to the substrate may be changed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for applying coating material to a receiving surface. It is often desirable to coat a substrate with a 
coating material, such as ink or an adhesive, in a desired 
location on the substrate. For example, pressure sensitive 
adhesive tape includes a web substrate coated with a layer 
of pressure sensitive adhesive. Similarly, POST-IT brand 
repositionable notes, available from the Minnesota Mining 
and Manufacturing Company of St. Paul, Minnesota, include 
a substrate having a band of pressure sensitive adhesive 
coated over a portion of the substrate. In these and other 
fields, it is desirable to apply the coating material to 
the substrate in a controlled manner. One process of applying a coating material to a 
substrate is known as gravure coating, and is illustrated 
schematically in Figure 1. The process includes a supply 
12 of a substrate 10, an application roller 14, and a 
supply of coating material 18 through which the 
application roller is drawn. Also shown are a backing 
roller 19 that opposes the application roller, a doctor 
blade 21 for wiping excess coating material from the 
application roller, and a winding system having one or 
more rollers 13 to draw the substrate between the 
application roller and the backing roller. As shown in 
Figure 2, the application roller includes a peripheral 
surface 30 having a multitude of individual cells 32 that 
are recessed from the peripheral surface of the 
application roller. The cells may be arranged in any 
pattern, as shown in Figure 3, wherein cells 32 are formed 
in the peripheral surface at certain locations, and no 
cells are formed in locations 34.  The cells collect the coating material as the 
application roller passes through the supply of coating 
material, and thus the areas of the peripheral surface 
without cells (e.g. locations 34) do not collect coating 
material. If any residual coating material collects on the 
peripheral surface of the application roller, doctor blade 
21 wipes that material from the peripheral surface prior 
to contact with the substrate. When the substrate passes the application 
interface between the application roller and the backing 
roller, the material is drawn out of each of the cells 
because the coating material has a greater affinity for 
the substrate than for the application roller. The surface 
speed of the application roller is matched to the speed of 
the substrate, to enable complete removal of the coating 
material from the individual cells. If

<CLAIMS>
An application member for conveying a coating 
material from a supply (110) of said material (102) to a 

receiving surface, and for applying the material to the 
receiving surface, comprising: 


(a) a hub (106) having a central axis for 
rotation thereabout, and having a generally cylindrical 

peripheral surface (108); and 
(b) a plurality of spaced, discrete structures 
(115) projecting from the peripheral surface of the hub; 
 
   whereby rotation of the hub about the central 

axis enables the peripheral surface to encounter a source 
of the coating material to receive the coating material, 

and to carry the coating material on the peripheral 
surface of the hub between and on said projecting 

structures to an application interface to transfer the 
material from the peripheral surface to the receiving 

surface. 
The application member of claim 1, wherein 
said application member further includes: 

   (c) means for rotating said hub about the 
central axis thereof. 
The application member of claim 1, wherein 
said projecting structures comprise a plurality of 

hemispheres. 
The application member of claim 1, wherein 
said member includes a release layer coated over the 

peripheral surface of the hub including the projecting 
members to facilitate transfer of the coating material 

from the peripheral surface to the receiving surface. 
The application member of claim 1, wherein 
the receiving surface is a paper substrate (104). 
The application member of claim 1, wherein 
said coating material is a pressure sensitive adhesive 

(102). 
The application member of claim 1, wherein 
said projecting structures each comprise a particle 

retained within an indentation in the peripheral surface 
of the hub, such that a portion of each particle projects 

above the peripheral surface of the hub. 
The application member of claim 7, wherein 
the hub further comprises a release coating over the 

peripheral surface and the projecting structures, to 
facilitate transfer of the coating material from the 

application member to the receiving surface. 
An application system for applying a coating 
material to a receiving surface, comprising: 


(a) a hub (106) having a central axis for 
rotation thereabout, and having a generally cylindrical 

peripheral surface (108), and including a plurality of 
spaced, discrete structures (115) projecting from said 

peripheral surface; and 
(b) means for rotating said hub about the 
central axis thereof at an angular velocity, said rotating 

means enabling the peripheral surface to pass a source of 
the coating material to receive the coating material and 

to carry the coating material on the peripheral surface 
between and on said projecting structures toward an 

application interface between the peripheral surface and 
the receiving surface, and to transfer said coating 

material to said receiving surface; 
 
   whereby an increase in the angular velocity of 

 
the hub increases the amount of coating material 

transferred to said receiving surface, and a decrease in 
the angular velocity of the hub decreases the amount of 

coating material transferred to said receiving surface. 
The application member of claim 9, wherein 
said projecting structures comprise a plurality of 

hemispheres. 
The application member of claim 9, wherein 
said member includes a release layer coated over the 

peripheral surface of the hub to facilitate transfer of
