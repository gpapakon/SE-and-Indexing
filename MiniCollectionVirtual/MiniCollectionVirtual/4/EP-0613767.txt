<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a green tyre is disclosed in 
which a carcass body (6a) having a toroidal BT band (9) 

around the outer peripheral portion thereof and bead 
wires (4) set at both sides thereof is mounted on a forming 

drum (13) which has bladders (16), (17) therearound. Side 
rubbers (20) are mounted around the drum (13). By 

expanding the bladders (16), (17), the side rubbers (20) are 
press-contacted with both sides of the carcass body (6a) 

for bonding thereto. "Polysheets" for separating the 
side rubbers (20) and the carcass body (6a) in the early steps 

of the method are not required and consequently the 
method can be carried out more quickly and efficiently.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
forming a green tyre, in particular, but not
exclusively, a pneumatic tyre for an automobile.In general, pneumatic tyres for automobiles are
manufactured as follows: firstly, the inner surface of
a tyre is formed from a toroidal carcass ply on which
an inner liner is lined. The crown portion of the
carcass ply is covered with a BT band comprising a belt
and a tread rubber. Portions extending from the side
surfaces of the carcass ply to the outer peripheral BT
band are covered with side rubbers. The green tyre
with such a construction is first formed of green
rubber, and is then vulcanized.Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings illustrates
the steps in one example of a conventional method of
forming the green tyre. In this method, as shown in
(A) of Figure 1, a carcass ply 02 is first wound around
a first forming drum 01 into a cylindrical shape, and
bead wires 03 are mounted at both side portions of the
carcass ply 02. Subsequently, the carcass ply 02 is
folded in such a manner as to be wrapped around these
bead wires 03. Next, as shown in (B), side rubbers 04
are wrapped and stuck around both the folded ends of
the carcass ply 02. A sheet 05, made from polyethylene
or the like (hereinafter referred to as the
"polysheet"), is interposed between each of the side
rubbers 04 and the carcass ply 02 so that the inner
peripheral surface portion of the side rubber 04 is not
adhesively bonded to the carcass ply 02.The carcass body thus formed is then removed from
the first forming drum 01, and is transferred onto a
second forming drum 06 (see (D)). The second forming
drum 06 is so constructed that a pair of drum bodies
06a and 06b having end surfaces opposed to each other
are connected to each other by means of a bladder 07. As shown in (C), a BT band 011, comprising a belt
09 and a tread 010, is formed separately on a BT drum
08. The BT band 011 is then transferred by means of a
transfer ring 012, and is positioned over the outer
peripheral portion of the second forming drum 06 on
which the carcass body is mounted (see (D)).As shown in (E), pressurized fluid is supplied to
the bladder 07 and both the drum bodies 06a and 06b are
then moved towards each other. This causes the bladder
07 to be expanded and deformed into a toroidal shape
and the side rubbers 04 to be raised outwards so that
the polysheets 05 can be removed. Accompanied with the
expansion of the bladder 07, the carcass ply 02 is
deformed in a toroidal shape, and is press-contacted
with the BT band 011

<CLAIMS>
A method of forming a green tyre, comprising:

on a first forming drum (1), forming a carcass
body (6) having bead portions (5) by mounting a bead

wire (4) at either side of a cylindrical carcass ply
(2);
deforming the carcass body (6) into a toroidal
shape;
bonding a BT band (9) to the outer peripheral
surface of the carcass body (6);
carrying the carcass body (6a) having the BT band
(9) bonded thereto to a second forming drum (13) and

mounting the carcass body (6a) on the second forming
drum (13), the second forming drum (13) having side

rubbers (20) positioned thereon adjacent each side of
the carcass body (6a);
bringing a side rubber (20) into contact with each
side of the carcass body (6a); and
bonding the side rubbers (20) to the sides of the
carcass body (6a),

   wherein the carcass body (6a) having the BT band
(9) bonded thereto is carried to the second forming

drum (13) whilst being maintained in its toroidal shape
by a holding/carrying apparatus which comprises (i) a

outer periphery holding body (11) adapted to hold the
outer peripheral surface of said carcass body (6a), and

(ii) a pair of bead portion holding bodies (12)
positioned on either side of the outer periphery

holding body (11) and adapted to hold the bead portions
(5) of the carcass body (6a).
A method of forming a green tyre as claimed
in claim 1, wherein the side rubbers (20) are pressed

against either side of the carcass body (6) having the
BT band (9) bonded thereto by means of inflatable

bladders (16,17) of the second forming drum (13) so
that they can be bonded to the sides of the carcass 

body (6).
In, or for use in, an apparatus for carrying
out the method of claim 1 or claim 2, which apparatus

comprises a said first forming drum (1) and a said
second forming drum (13),


a holding/carrying apparatus (21) for transferring
the carcass body (6a) with the BT band (9) bonded

thereto from the first forming drum (1) to the second
forming drum (13) while maintaining the carcass body

(6a) in a toroidal shape, the holding/carrying
apparatus (21) comprising:
an outer periphery holding body (28) for holding
the outer peripheral surface of the carcass body; and
a pair of bead portion holding bodies (29) for
holding the bead portions (5) of the carcass (6a), the

bead portion holding bodies (29) being positioned
either side of the outer periphery holding body (28)

and being movable towards or away from each other
symmetrically with respect to the outer periphery

holding body (28).
A holding/carrying apparatus (21) as claimed
in claim 3, wherein the outer periphery holding body

(28) and the bead portion holding bodies (29) each
comprise (i) a plurality of holding segments (31,33),

which holding segments (31,33) are circumferentially
disposed at substantially equal intervals and are

movable in the radial direction, and (ii) a mechanism
