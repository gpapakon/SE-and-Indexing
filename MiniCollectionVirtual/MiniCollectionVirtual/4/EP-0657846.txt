<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printing
apparatus having a power saving function (sleep mode)
for suppressing power consumption in a non-printing
state, a system having the same, and a method of
controlling the printing apparatus.In recent years, printing apparatuses of this type,
e.g., page printers represented by laser beam printers
have become rapidly widespread.Generally, an apparatus of this type is constituted
by a printer controller for receiving printing data to
generate a printing image and at the same time
controlling the entire apparatus, and a printer engine
for actually performing printing. Since the printer
engine has a thermal fixing unit, the power consumption
is undesirably increased.For this reason, in a printing standby state, in
other words, when a predetermined period of time has
elapsed after supply of printing data from a host unit
(e.g., host computer) is cut off, power to the printer
engine, particularly to the thermal fixing unit is
stopped, thereby appropriately suppressing the power 
consumption. That is, this printer has a sleep mode (or
power save mode).Setting and canceling of the sleep mode are
controlled by the printer controller (CPU in the printer
controller). More specifically, upon power-on, or when
a predetermined period of time has elapsed after
completion of printing processing, and no further
printing data is received, power supply to the printer
engine is stopped. If printing data is received in the
sleep mode, power supply to the printer engine is
resumed.EP-A-0 526 189 discloses a printing system which consists of a host computer and one printer
with an interface, which are directily connected via an interface cable. The printer has a
sleeping mode for saving power. The printer interface is supply with power when the printer is in
the sleeping mode. The printer is brought to the active mode by means of a hardware interrupt.Although the power consumption can be surely
reduced in the sleep mode as compared to an actual
printing mode, power supply to the printer controller
never stops. Additionally, the CPU and various circuits
requiring a large power consumption are connected to the
printer controller through buses. Taking these factors
into consideration, no sufficient power saving effect
can be obtained yet.The present invention has been made to solve the
above problem.
The invention provides a printing apparatus as defined in claim 1, a printing system according to claim 10 and a controlling method as defined in claim 11.
