<DESCRIPTION>
 ABRASIVE COATING REMOVER AND PROCESS FOR USING SAME BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates in general to a process for removing adherent material, such as paint, scale or other coverings from hard metal surfaces and, more particularly, to a non-chemical surface cleaning process employing mechanical blast.For various types of structures, it is often necessary or desirable to remove any layer of coating which has been previously applied to or formed on surface areas. Numerous techniques exits for removing paint, sealants, lacquers, rust, scale and other adherent materials from virtually any type of surface. Surface cleaning or stripping methods range from mechanical abrasion to the use of strong chemicals and involve varying degrees of time, effort and expense. For any given type of coating, the character and function of the substrate material from which a coating is to be removed usually dictates the stripping method, at least in industrial settings. Hard, durable surfaces, such as heavy steel plating can be cleaned or stripped by relatively fast abrasive methods such as sand blasting. Softer metals such as aluminum or more delicate surfaces such as polymer composite layers may require the use of a softer abrasive material during blasting or require careful chemical removal to prevent damage or destruction of the substrate. Sand blasting of steel plate to remove adherent coatings and the like, while successful in removing the coatings, has several disadvantages. For one, the sand abrasive is very friable such that upon contact with the surface, a vast amount of 

silica dust is formed. Recently there has been a concern that the minute silicious particles which are formed present a substantial health hazard, in particular, if ingested into the lungs. Secondly, very large amounts of sand are required for cleaning large structures such as bridges, stacks, etc. such that after blasting, this sand remains and must be removed from the area adding substantially to the time and expense of the process. Alternative abrasives are known. For example, U.S. 3,775,180 is directed to a method for descaling steel in which the steel is descaled by spraying a mixture of a solid such as aluminum oxide or silicon carbide with water and a gas such as air under specified conditions onto the steel. In removing a coating or a scale on the surface of a metal, however, it is important that the anchor pattern (surface roughness) of the metal surface be uniform and not to extensive such that the surface and even the
