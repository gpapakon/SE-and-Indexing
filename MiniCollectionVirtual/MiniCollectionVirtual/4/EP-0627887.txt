<ABSTRACT>
In the method for treatment of potato pulp the potato pulp is first cooked and subsequently, after proper cooling, exposed to an enzymatic degradation process by means of a cell wall degradation enzyme, and then, if necessary, preserved to a product, which exhibits microbial stability. Hereby a cheap and simple conversion of the potato pulp to a nutritionally valuable and stable fodder is achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention comprises a method for treatment of potato pulp. Potato pulp is a certain fraction which appears during the potato starch 
production. The disintegrated, clean potato chips are first introduced into a decanter, 
the supernatant therefrom being the fruit water, which is further processed; the 
residue is introduced into a centrifugal sieve, from which two fractions are taken out, 
i.e. the potato starch fraction and the potato pulp fraction. This potato pulp fraction consists of arabino galactan, cellulose, pectin, 
protein and a small amount of starch, and it exhibits a strong water binding capacity. 
The potato pulp contains only 3-4% dry matter and exhibits a gelly consistency. If 
exposed to pressure the water content of the potato pulp can be raised to around 
10%, and in that case the consistency is like the consistency of marzipan. The potato pulp has posed a problem to the farmers and to industry. 
One possibility is discarding the potato pulp, due to the low nutritional value thereof, 
and in that case an environmental problem arises. Another possibility comprises that 
the farmer takes the potato pulp back to the farm, in that case, however, it has to 
be used very soon as a fodder in order to prevent putrefaction, and it can be used 
only for certain animals. Furthermore, potato pulp is only produced around 3 months 
a year, which means that the quality of a composed fodder will vary over the year, 
if potato pulp is used as a fodder ingredient. This is unwanted from the point of view 
of the fodder producers. The purpose of the invention is the provision of a cheap and simple 
conversion of the potato pulp to a nutritionally valuable and stable fodder. Surprisingly it has been found that this purpose can be achieved by a 
combination of a cooking and a treatment with a specially selected enzyme. Thus, the method for treatment of potato pulp according to the 
invention is characterized by the fact that the potato pulp is first cooked, and 
subsequently, after proper cooling, exposed to an enzymatic degradation process 
by means of a cell wall degradation enzyme, and then, if necessary, preserved to 
a product, which exhibits microbial stability, in any conventional manner.  
 The cooking process ordinarily comprises a heating to at least 100°C 
for a time period of at least 5 minutes. However, the higher the temperature, the 
smaller the time interval, and vice versa. "Proper cooling" is to be understood as cooling to a temperature, at 
which the enzyme or enzymes possess at

Method for treatment of potato pulp, characterized by the fact that the 
potato pulp is first cooked and subsequently, after proper cooling, exposed to an 

enzymatic degradation process by means of a cell wall degradation enzyme, and 
then, if necessary, preserved to a product, which exhibits microbial stability, in any 

conventional manner. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized by the fact that the cooking 
is a jet cooking, which is carried out at a temperature between 125 and 140°C, and 

for a time interval of between 20 and 100 seconds. 
Method according to Claims 1 - 2, characterized by the fact that the 
enzymatic degradation process is carried out by means of SPS-ase. 
Method according to Claims 1 - 3, characterized by the fact that the 
enzymatic degradation process is supported by means of cellulase and/or 

hemicellulase. 
Method according to Claims 1 - 4, characterized by the fact that the 
temperature and pH-value is chosen in such manner that both the stability and the 

activity of the enzyme or enzymes are close to optimal values. 
Method according to Claims 1 - 5, characterized by the fact that a 
preservation
 is carried out and that the preservation comprises a concentration and 
a subsequent spray drying to a material with a water content of less than 5%.  

 
Method according to Claim 6, characterized by the fact that the 
concentrate immediately before spray drying is mixed with potato fruit water, which 

has been jet cooked, enzyme treated and concentrated. 
Method according to Claims 1 - 7, characterized by the fact that the 
soluble part of the process stream between the enzymatic degradation process and 

the preservation process is exposed to an ultrafiltration process by means of an 
ultrafiltration equipment with a cut off value of 20,000 Dalton.
