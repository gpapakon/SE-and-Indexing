<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to amino acid-derived
bioerodible polymers and to methods of
synthesizing such polymers.Polyesters in general are highly useful and
intensively studied materials. Polyesters have been
classified according to the nature of the polyhydric
compounds and dicarboxylic acids from which the polymers
are derived. Polyesters derived from aromatic
polyhydric compounds are classified as polyarylates,
with polyarylates of aliphatic diacids classified as
aliphatic polyarylates and polyarylates of aromatic
diacids classified as aromatic polyarylates. Polyesters
derived from aliphatic polyhydric compounds and
aliphatic diacids are classified as aliphatic
polyesters, and polyesters derived from aliphatic
polyhydric compounds and aromatic diacids are classified
as aliphatic-aromatic polyesters. See Imai et al.,
"Synthesis and Characterization of Aromatic Polyesters,"
Handbook of Polymer Science and Technology, Vol. 1, N.
Cheremisinoff, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York and
Basel, 1989), 177-208.A wide range of aliphatic polyesters (e.g.,
poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), polydioxanone,
poly(hydroxybutyrate), polycapro-lactone and the like)
have been explored as biomaterials, especially in the
context of degradable medical implants because of their
hydrolytic instability. See, Huang, "Biodegradable
Polymers," Encyclopedia of Polvmer Science and
Technology, (F.H. Mark et al., ed., John Wiley and Sons,
New York 1985), vol. 2, 220-43. Because of their
hydrolytic instability, however, aliphatic polyesters
are not used as industrial engineering plastics. Aliphatic-aromatic polyesters include
poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(butylene
terephthalate) (PBT). Some aliphatic-aromatic
polyesters are very important commercial plastics, but
(with the exception of DACRON®) have not been widely
investigated in the biomaterials area. DACRON® is a PET
used as an artificial vascular graft. See, Silver et
al., Biocompatibility: Interactions of Biological and
Implantable Materials, vol. 1, (VCH Publishers, New
York, 1989) 240-3. Aliphatic-aromatic polyesters are
hydrolytically much more stable than aliphatic
polyesters and are degraded under physiological
conditions at such a slow rate that they are regarded as
"nondegradable."Aromatic polyarylates have recently gained
importance as liquid crystalline polymers. These
polymers are derived from aromatic dicarboxylic acids
and diphenols (bisphenols). Many aromatic polyarylates
possess highly desirable properties for use as
engineering plastics,
