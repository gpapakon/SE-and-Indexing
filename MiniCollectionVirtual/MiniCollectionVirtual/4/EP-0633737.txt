<ABSTRACT>
In a shoe sole (2) comprising a first chamber (6) and a second chamber (7), which chambers are completely or partially filled with a fluid (10), and a channel (11) interconnecting said chambers (6, 7), by means of which channel the fluid (10) upon compression of one of the chambers (6 or 7) may be transferred to the other one of said chambers to expand said other chamber, the first chamber (6) is positioned so as to extend essentially only underneath the heel portion (8) of the foot (5) whereas the second chamber (7) is positioned so as to extend essentially only underneath the longitudinal arch (9) of the foot (5). Upon expansion of the second chamber (7) due to the compression of the first chamber (6) when affected by the heel portion (8), said second chamber forms a dynamic pronation support underneath the longitudinal arch (9). When this arch bears a weight thereon, it causes the second chamber (7) to be compressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally concerns a shoe sole
having a dynamically shock-absorbing structure, but above
all a shoe sole providing a dynamic pronation support. The
shoe sole is particularly suitable for sport shoes and may
be used for instance for running on hard surfaces. It may
also be used in e.g. walking boots, working shoes, in
principle in all types of footgear. It may also be
designed as a separate insole to be placed inside the shoe
it is designed for.In walking and running, the foot has to bear considerable
weight corresponding to several times the body
weight, each time it is set down into contact with the
ground or the surface underneath. The cushion of fat found
for instance in the heel dampens the impact upon heel
strikes, that is the phase of the walking cycle when the
heel is set down into contact with the surface underfoot.
At the midstance stage of the walking cycle, when the
whole foot is in contact with the surface, and at the heel
elevation stage, when the heel portion is lifted, the main
weight is on the longitudinal arch of the foot (the arch
extending lengthwise on the inner side of the foot),
resulting in deformation of this arch which plays an
important part of the energy absorption.During walking and running the feet pronate, i.e. the
outwards margin of the foot is turned outwards-upwards as
the foot is set down on the ground or the support. An
increase of the pronation results in an increase of the
weight on the longitudinal arch of the foot and consequently
a higher risk of overstraining, which in turn may
be the cause of permanent deformation of the arch.Congenital anatomic conditions, such as an increased
pronation or other weaknesses in the foot, cause degradation
or weakening of the various functions of the foot
which may give rise to insufficiency symptoms originating
from the longitudinal arch. The problems caused by 
weakened longitudinal arches may often be remedied by the
use of suitable arch supports. Also originally normal
longitudinal arches may, when exposed repeatedly to heavy
loads from walking or running on very hard surfaces, may
lose their vaulted shape and consequently their weight-distributing
capacity, which could also produce insufficiency
symptoms.Problems of this kind are common and are caused for
instance by the use of unsuitable or bad-fitting shoes, or
e.g. by activities carried out on hard surfaces, such as
ashpalt and concrete. Preventive as well as therapeutic
measures to avoid such insufficiency conditions therefore
are most important.

<CLAIMS>
A shoe (1) fitted with a shoe sole (2) comprising a first
chamber (6) and a second chamber (7), said chambers (6, 7)

being arranged in said sole (2) and being completely or
partially filled with a fluid (10), and a channel (11) interconnecting

said chambers (6, 7), through which interconnecting
channel (11), upon compression of said first chamber (6), fluid

(10) is transmitted from said first chamber (6) to the second
chamber (7) for expansion of said second chamber (7), or

reversely, said first chamber (6) being positioned essentially
only underneath the heel portion (8) of a wearer's foot (5),

the second chamber (7) being positioned essentially only underneath
the longitudinal arch (9) of the foot (5), said interconnecting

channel (11) comprising an adjustable throttling
means for controlled throttling of the flow of the fluid (10)

between the chambers (6, 7), so that due to the compression of
the first chamber (6) when the latter is affected by the heel

portion (8) of the foot (5) said second chamber (7) fills with
fluid (10) and expands so as to lift the longitudinal arch (9)

of the foot (5) immediately before said arch (9) is about to
absorb the load, which arch (9) is then deformed, whereby said

longitudinal arch (9) of the foot (5) receives a dynamic
pronation support during the deformation which is gradually

dampened.
A shoe (1) as claimed in claim 1, wherein in its expanded
condition the second chamber (7) imparts to the portion (12) of

the sole (2) that is contiguous with the longitudinal arch (9)
of the foot (5) a configuration conforming to the natural shape

of the longitudinal arch (9) of the foot (5) in the non-weight-bearing
condition of said arch (9).
A shoe sole (2) comprising a first chamber (6) and a second
chamber (7), said chambers (6, 7) being arranged in said sole

(2) and being completely or partially filled with a fluid (10),
and a channel (11) interconnecting said chambers (6, 7),

through which interconnecting channel (11), upon compression of
said first chamber (6), fluid (10) is transmitted from said

first chamber (6) to the second chamber (7) for expansion of
said second chamber (7), or reversely, said first chamber (6)

being positioned essentially only underneath the heel portion
(8) of a wearer's foot (5), the second chamber (7) being

positioned essentially only underneath the longitudinal arch
(9) of the foot (5), said interconnecting channel (11)

comprising an adjustable throttling means for controlled
throttling of the flow of the fluid (10) between the chambers

(6, 7), so that due to the compression of the first chamber (6)
when the latter is affected by the heel portion (8) of the foot

(5) said second chamber (7) fills with fluid (10) and expands
so as to lift the longitudinal arch (9) of the foot (5)

immediately before said arch (9) is about to absorb the load,
which arch (9) is then deformed, whereby said longitudinal arch

(9) of the foot (5) receives a dynamic pronation support during
the deformation which is gradually dampened.
