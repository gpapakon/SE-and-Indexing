<ABSTRACT>
A process has an open-loop which detects the total current intensity of actuators and supplies it to a microprocessor (1). In a modulation mode, the microprocessor successively generates at its output modulated set value signals for each actuator. The set value signals lie below the response level of the process. The microprocessor then determines compensating values from the total current signal with which the set values of the actuators are corrected. The (regulating) speed of a control is thus combined with the accuracy of a regulation, and the hardware expenditure (costs) is minimized thanks to the total current detection instead of individual current detection.

Process for triggering electrical, current-controlled 
actuators (5) using a microprocessor (1) having memories 

in which process-relevant data, performance 
characteristics and sequential programs for controlling a 

process are stored, and having inputs (2, 3) at which 
signals of influencing variables are input, which, after 

logical control using the stored data and programs, are 
processed and output by the microprocessor (1) as 

setpoints for the current intensity of the actuators (5), 

characterised in that
in intervals in which no signals of the influencing 
variables (actuating signals), which cause displacement 

of the actuators, are applied to the inputs (2) of the 
microprocessor (1), the microprocessor (1) for the 

individual actuators (5) outputs setpoints according to a 
standardized modulation program, which setpoints are 

below the response threshold of the process, 
that the current intensity of the actuators (5) is 
measured and the corresponding current signal is applied 

to inputs (3) of the microprocessor (1), 
that from the current changes which result from the 
modulation and provide indication of the existence of 

disturbance variables, the microprocessor (1) determines 
and temporarily stores compensation values and that the 

compensation value stored last is used for the 
determination of the manipulated variable as soon as an 

actuating signal appears at one input (2). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the total current of several or all of the actuators (5) 

is determined by a single current measuring device (11), 
and 


that in the modulation mode the microprocessor (1) 
determines the compensation values for the individual 

actuators (5) in succession, 
that each of the manipulated variables for the individual  
 

actuators is corrected by means of the corresponding 
compensation values.
