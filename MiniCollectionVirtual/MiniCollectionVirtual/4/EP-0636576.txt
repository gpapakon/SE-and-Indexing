<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is intended to provide a nitrous oxide 
producing method and unit which can produce nitrous oxide of 

ultra-high purity at a higher recovery. 
According to the present invention, a feed gas (2) comprising 
nitrous oxide and containing nitrogen, oxygen and water in a 

saturated state as impurities is compressed 
by compressor (4) and water in the compressed feed gas is removed 

by a drier (8), and then the feed gas is cooled down in a main 
heat exchanger (12) so as to form mixed gas-liquid nitrous oxide. 

Then, this mixed gas-liquid nitrous oxide is introduced into 
a rectification column (16), where it is rectified and separated 

through gas-liquid contact therein so that high purity 
liquefied nitrous oxide is reservoired in the bottom thereof. 

Nitrogen and oxygen in the high purity liquefied nitrous 
oxide are evaporated and stripped off by means of a 

boiler (18) making use of the mixed gas-liquid nitrous oxide 
as a heat source, whereby it can be purified to ultra-high 

purity liquefied nitrous oxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and a unit for 
producing nitrous oxide (N₂O) of ultra-high purity. Nitrous oxide is used for surgical anaesthesia and detection 
of fluid leakage, and further used for manufacture of 
electronic parts. A method for producing nitrous oxide of high purity is known 
which comprises reacting ammonia and oxygen to prepare a feed 
gas (raw gas), compressing this feed gas and subjecting the 
compressed feed air to a high-pressure water washing, and 
further compressing the water-washed feed gas and drying the 
compressed feed gas, and thereafter liquefying the compressed 
and dried feed gas and taking out the liquefied gas as a 
product (see : "11, 290 Chemical Products" published by 
Kagaku Kogyo Nipposha). In the aforementioned nitrous oxide producing method of the 
prior art, however, the purity of nitrous oxide which can be 
produced is only as high as 97 ∼ 98% and it has been 
impossible to produce ultra-high purity nitrous oxide having 
a purity of 99.999% or more that is required in the field of 
manufacture of electronic parts in the recent years. Also in this method of the prior art, the recovery of nitrous 
oxide from the feed gas is as low as 80 ∼ 90% and a higher 
recovery thereof is required.  It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide 
a nitrous oxide producing method and unit which can produce 
nitrous oxide of ultra-high purity at a higher recovery. In order to achieve the aforementioned purpose, the ultra-high 
purity nitrous oxide producing method according to the 
invention of claim 1 is characterised by comprising 
compressing a nitrous oxide feed gas containing nitrogen, 
oxygen and water in a saturated state as impurities 
removing water in the compressed feed gas and cooling down 
the compressed feed gas so that it is turned to gas-liquid 
mixed nitrous oxide ; then rectifying and separating the 
mixed gas-liquid nitrous oxide through gas-liquid contact in 
a rectification column so that it is turned to high purity 
liquefied nitrous oxide ; and further evaporating and 
stripping off nitrogen and oxygen in the high purity 
liquefied nitrous oxide by means of an evaporator, thereby 
purifying it to ultra-high purity liquefied nitrous oxide. The ultra-high purity nitrous oxide producing unit for 
carrying out the aforementioned ultra-high purity nitrous 
oxide producing method is characterised, as set forth in 
claim 2, by comprising : a compressor for compressing a 
nitrous oxide feed gas containing nitrogen, oxygen and water
