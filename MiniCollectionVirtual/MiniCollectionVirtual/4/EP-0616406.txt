<ABSTRACT>
The installation is constituted by disposing closely 
transfor
mer units (TR) at the back side of aligned switch 
board units (S) in the longitudinal direction of the 

switch board units (S) and switch gear units (R) in a 
direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of 

the switch board units (S) in such a manner to form a 
substantially rectangular shape as a whole. 
By making use of the fundamental constitution of one 
circuit line and one bank system many kinds of 

modifications can be realized and a large lay-out freedom 
in response to site shapes, electric power receiving 

conditions and extending requirements of customers is 
obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a compound type 
electric power receiving and transforming installation 
and, in particular, relates to a compound type electric 
power receiving and transforming installation which can 
be freely laid out in response to customer's requirement 
with regard to the customer's site and the building 
configuration. Large scale buildings and factories are supplied 
with electric power from electric power supply companies 
via their electric power receiving and transforming 
installations and are identified as an extra-high voltage 
consumer or a high voltage consumer depending on the 
voltage levels of the receiving electric power. The 
electric power receiving and transforming installation as 
referred to above is one which is constituted by a 
transformer, a switch gear unit, an electric energy 
measuring apparatus and a switch board as its major 
constitutions and supplies electric power, and, 
in particular one in which these constitutions are  
 
constituted in a unit is called as a compound type 
electric power receiving and transforming installation. 
JP-A-2-262808(1990) discloses such compound type electric 
power receiving and transforming installation. Although an electric power receiving and 
transforming installation is an important facility for an 
extra-high voltage consumer or a high voltage consumer 
for supplying electric power to the loads within the 
site, the installation is generally and frequently 
located at a corner of the customer's site. For example, 
in case of a department store, the electric power 
receiving and transforming installation is disposed at an 
innoticable place such as underground floor and further 
it is required to minimized the space occupied by such 
electric power receiving and transforming installation so 
as to obtain a maximum store space. Under the above 
explained background, the compound type electric power 
receiving and transforming installation is designed to 
efficiently dispose such devices as a transformer unit, a 
switch gear unit, an electric energy measuring apparatus 
and a switch board from a view point to minimize the site 
area. An electric power receiving and transforming 
installation is generally disposed at a site prepared by 
a customer such that the site is not necessarily matched 
with the configuration of a compound type electric power 
receiving and transforming installation. For this  
 
reason, in actual practice the lay-outs of respective 
electric power receiving and transforming installations 
are
