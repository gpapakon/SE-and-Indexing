<ABSTRACT>
A method for FM modulation of a digital carrier signal with a digital AF signal by means of a feedback-type phase accumulator and a carrier oscillator which generates the samples of the modulated FM oscillation, characterised in that the modulation signal is sampled at the sampling rate fA/P, where P
>
1, in that the sampling rate is interpolated (increased) by the factor P and the AF signal is filtered by means of an interpolation filter inserted before or after the feedback-type phase accumulator, in that the carrier oscillator which operates at the sampling rate fA generates a complex-valued FM carrier signal, the carrier frequency of the unmodulated carrier at the modulation output end being fC = M . fA/P + f0, where M
>
1 and f0 is an auxiliary frequency, and in that band limiting is effected subsequently by means of a complex-valued filter. Fully digitised frequency modulator with reduced nonlinear distortions after the demodulation, integrable as VLSI/ASIC chip, general application in the field of frequency modulation and especially in digital FM broadcasting and for transmitting its signals via optical fibre.

Method for FM modulating a digital carrier
signal (fc) with a digital AF signal v(kT) by means of

a feedback-type phase accumulator and a carrier
oscillator which, controlled numerically, generates the

samples of the modulated FM oscillation or,
respectively, of the FM signal, characterized in that

the modulating AF signal is sampled at the sampling

feedback-type phase accumulator, the sampling rate is

interpolated (increased) by the factor P by means of an
inserted interpolation filter (IPF) and the AF signal

is filtered,

generated from this band-limited FM signal (y) by
calculating the real or imaginary part.

that the real-valued FM output signal is

digital/analog-converted.
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the analog FM output signal is smoothed (y(t)) by

means of an analog smoothing filter (ABP, ATP).

complex oscillator (COSZ).
Method according to Claim 8, characterized in

that the table of the complex oscillator (COSZ)

different addresses which are simultaneously selected
and read out for supplying the real and imaginary part

same address.
Method according to Claim 8, characterized in
that the table of the complex oscillator (COSZ) only
