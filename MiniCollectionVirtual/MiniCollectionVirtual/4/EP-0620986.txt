<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a foldable fastener (clasp), for a bracelet, comprising a central longitudinal member (10), each end of which is articulated to a pair of outer folding leaves (20, 21) formed as shafts such that these folding leaves, upon closure, are juxtaposed about the central longitudinal member. These folding leaves are connected at their ends by means of a small fastening bar of a bracelet strand (1) or by means of a carrier cylinder (24) for a small bar of this type. The link of the cylinder, or of the small bar, to the folding leaves is achieved by two lateral uprights (22) offsetting this cylinder, or small bar, above the plane containing the ends of the folding leaves. The inner face of the end of each folding leaf is equipped with an anchoring member (26) provided in order to engage elastically with a complementary member provided correspondingly on the outer side of the central longitudinal member.

Folding bracelet clasp comprising a central
longitudinal member (10) of which one of the ends is

articulated to a pair of outer folding members (20, 21) or
a single folding member (20, 21, 24) formed as shafts so

that this or these folding members, when closed, can be
placed about the central longitudinal member, this or these

folding members being connected at one of the end or ends
by a securing pin of a bracelet section (1) or by a

supporting cylinder (24) for such a pin, the other end of
the central longitudinal member being articulated to

another cylinder or pin, or to a second pair of outer
folding members, connection of the cylinder or pin to the

single folding member (20, 21, 24) or to the folding
members of the pair of folding members (20, 21) being

achieved by two lateral uprights (22) forming an inverted
U-shaped linkage offsetting this cylinder or pin above the

plane containing the ends of the folding members,
characterized in that the inverted U-shaped linkage having

an elasticity such that a securing device (26) fitted to
the inner face of the end of the single folding member (20,

21, 24) or of each folding member of the pair of folding
members (20, 21) can engage elastically with a

complementary device provided in correspondence on the
outer flank of the central longitudinal member.
Folding clasp according to claim 1, characterized in
that the lateral uprights (22) are perpendicular to the

ends of the folding members (20, 21), and in that the
securing members are made in the form of convex projections

or concave housings (26) provided along the inner faces of
the ends of the folding members, and of which the cross-section

is triangular with an angle at its apex greater
than 120 degrees. 
Folding clasp according to claim 1, characterized in
that the lateral uprig
hts (22') are oblique relative to the
ends of the folding members (20, 21) so as to hold the

cylinder (24) beyond the said ends, and in that the
securing devices are made in the form of convex projections

or concave housings (26) provided along the lower edges of
the inner faces of the ends of the folding members, and of

which the cross-section is a regular trapezium.
Folding clasp according to claim 3, characterized in
that the uprights (22) have a parallel groove (23) between

the projection or housing (26'') and the cylinder (24).
Folding clasp according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the cylinder or pin (24) has a

central notch (25) or a pair of lateral notches (27, 29).
Folding clasp according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the longitudinal member (10), formed

of a single piece or of two parallel blades (16, 18), has a
central cut-out (15).
Folding clasp according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the longitudinal member (10) is

formed of two parallel blades (11, 13) the spacing of which
is adjusted by one or more transverse screws (30).
Folding clasp according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the longitudinal member (10) is

formed of two parallel blades (11, 13) held apart by two
pivots (48), it being possible for their ends to be gripped

together as required by transverse screws (40), causing the
central part of the blades to move apart.
Folding clasp according to claim 6, characterized in
that the cut-out has a V-shaped part 52 in which a wedge 60

is forced to a greater or lesser degree, for example by 
means of a screw 70 passing through the wedge through a

tapped hole 68 and bearing against the end 72 of the cut-out
facing the V-shaped part.
