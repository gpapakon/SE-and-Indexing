<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an audio amplifier having a volume-dependent 
tone control which is inexpensive and hardly distorts the audio signal. A filter in the 

signal path of the audio amplifier determines the tone control at low volumes. The bass 
tones and possibly treble tones are then amplified to a greater extent than the mid-range 

tones. With an increasing volume, a continuously controllable amplifier stage 
increasingly compensates this tone control. To this end a linear feedback path is 

arranged across this amplifier stage, with a pole in or near the frequency range of the 
bass and mid-range tones.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an audio amplifier arrangement as defined in the 
preamble of Claim 1. Such an arrangement is known per se from Japanese Patent publication 
Kokai 61-158205. It may be incorporated, for example in a television or radio apparatus, a 
portable compact disc player or a "walkman" and may be denoted by the term "dynamic bass 
boost". It maintains the perceptual sound quality throughout the volume range by amplifying 
bass tones up to the order of 400 Hz and possibly treble tones from an order of 4 kHz at a 
low volume to a larger extent than mid-range tones which are between said frequency ranges. Fig. 1 shows the known arrangement. A filtering device 2 is coupled to 
an amplifier 3 which in its turn is coupled to a loudspeaker 4 and to a detection device 5. 
The amplitude-frequency response of the filtering device 2 is switchable by means of a 
switching signal Sd between substantially two fixed characteristics. The output of the 
detection device 5 supplies the switching signal Sd which depends on the amplitude of the 
output signal of the amplifier 3 applied to the loudspeaker 4. If the afore-mentioned amplitude exceeds a predetermined value, the 
switching signal Sd adjusts the filtering device 2 in such a way that it exhibits a substantially 
flat amplitude-frequency response. In this condition the known arrangement amplifies all 
tones to an equal extent. If the amplitude falls below the predetermined value, the switching 
signal Sd adjusts the filtering device 2 in such a way that it has an amplitude-frequency 
response at which mid-range tones are attenuated. In this condition the known arrangement 
amplifies both the bass tones and the treble tones to a relatively  
 
greater extent. The known arrangement has a plurality of considerable shortcomings. First, a relatively large number of components is required for realising the 
volume-dependent tone control. In practice, notably detection device 5 will often 
comprise a larger number of more expensive components than that shown in the 
embodiment in the afore-mentioned Patent publication. The relatively high cost price of 
the known arrangement renders it less suitable for use in lowest consumer electronics. Secondly, the tone control is adjusted in steps to the volume. The 
amplitude-frequency response of the known arrangement has only two characteristics. 
The deviation from an optimal characteristic associated with each volume may thus be 
relatively large. Moreover, a small variation of volume may result in abrupt
