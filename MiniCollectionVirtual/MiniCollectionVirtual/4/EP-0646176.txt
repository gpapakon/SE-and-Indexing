<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation in part of
copending application serial number 07/851,082 filed
March 13, 1992 which is a continuation in part of
application serial number 07/814,823 filed December
23, 1991 which is, a continuation of application
serial number 07/742,199 filed August 5, 1991 which
is, in turn, a continuation of application serial
number 07/522,440 filed May 11, 1990. The latter two
applications are now abandoned.This invention relates generally to products and
processes useful to deliver proteins, including
protein antigens, to the surface of gram-positive
bacteria and firmly attach them to the cell. More
specifically, it relates to the production of a
fusion protein containing at least the anchor region
of the cell associated region of a gram-positive
surface protein and any protein, peptide or
polypeptide that may be usefully administered to an
animal host. The products of the invention which
comprise proteins, peptides or polypeptides, as
further discussed below, placed on the surface of a 
gram positive bacteria may be used to deliver such
materials to the animal host to elicit an immungenic
response, for example the production of protective
antibodies or for another useful purpose. The
protein, peptide or polypeptide may, for example, be
an enzyme or other functional protein necessary for a
specific purpose. It may be an antigenic determinant
from a bacteria, virus, parasite or fungus. It may
be a surface antigen from a mammalian tumor cell or
of male sperm. It may be an allergen such as a
vespid venom. The invention also relates to novel
plasmids, genes, chromosomes and transformed bacteria
employed in the production of such fusion proteins.
The invention, additionally, provides novel vaccines
which employ gram-positive bacteria designed to
deliver to an animal host a foreign antigen normally
present on a pathogenic microorganism which is
associated with the virulence of that pathogen and
which will elicit antigens to protect the host
against infection or disease caused by the pathogenic
microorganism.The products of the invention are also useful as
diagnostic agents. The invention also provides a means to deliver
enzymes, placed on the bacterial surface, to specific
areas of interest.The term "animal" as used herein refers to
living beings including mammals such as man; bovines,
especially beef cattle; sheep and goats; poultry,
especially chickens, ducks and turkeys; as well as
fish, especially those raised in fish farms such as
salmon, trout and catfish. This invention is of
