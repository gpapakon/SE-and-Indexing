<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel azo compound,
its metal complex compound, a water-soluble azo dye
containing the same, and a polarizing film having a high
polarization degree in which the above-mentioned dye is
contained and oriented as a dichromatic dye in a polymer
film.As a polarizing element for use in a polarizing
film, iodine has heretofore been used, and in recent years,
the utilization of organic dyes has also been investigated.However, iodine which has heretofore been used has
a high polarization performance, but since having large
sublimation properties, iodine is disadvantageously poor in
heat resistance, when added as the polarizing element to
the polarizing film.In order to overcome this drawback, there have been
suggested some polarizing films containing organic dyes as
the polarizing elements and having improved heat resistance 
in Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 61988/1990 [CA 114(4):
25812b], 50944/1992 [CA 104(10): 70283j], 61893/1992 [CA
104(10): 69953w), USP 4,514,559, Japanese Patent Application
Laid-open Nos. 269136/1990 (USP 5,007,942),
222459/1990 (USP 5,272,259), 226162/1992 (USP 5,122,557);
68902/1991 (CA 115(12): 115333w) and 89203/1991 [CA
114(10): 83482e).However, such polarizing films are not always
satisfactory in point of a polarizing performance.Thus, it is desired to develop a dye for a dye-based
polarizing film which can exert the polarizing performance
comparable to that of an iodine-based polarizing
film.A preferred embodiment of the present invention is an
azo compound suitable for a polarizing film containing a
polymer film as a base material, and a high-performance
polarizing film having excellent polarizing properties and
heat resistance obtained by orienting and adding the compound.The present inventors have intensively researched
with the intention of obtaining a polarizing film containing
an azo compound as a polarizing element and having an
excellent polarizing performance and high hydrothermo-resistance, 
and as a result, the present invention has now
been attained. That is, the present invention is directed
to an azo compound represented by formula (1), (2) or (3):

wherein each of R1 and R3 is independently a hydrogen atom,
halogen atom, hydroxyl group, alkyl group having 1 or 2
carbon atoms, or alkoxy group having 1 or 2 carbon atoms;
each of R2 and R4 is independently a hydrogen atom, hydroxyl
group, alkyl group having 1 or 2 carbon atoms, alkoxy group
having 1 or 2 carbon atoms, or acetylamino group; R5 is a
hydroxyl group or amino group at
