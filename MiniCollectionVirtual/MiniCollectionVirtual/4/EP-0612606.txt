<ABSTRACT>
Method of filament winding, especially for the manufacture of conical storage silo hoppers, characterised in that a former (10), comprising two truncated cones (12, 14) joined together by their large bases (16, 18), is arranged, this former (10) is set in rotation about its longitudinal axis (24), means (30) are arranged for unwinding filaments (80) driven in an alternating translational movement with respect to the longitudinal axis (24) of this former (10), and the winding of the filaments (80) around the said former (10) is carried out. The subject of the invention is also the device enabling the method to be implemented.
