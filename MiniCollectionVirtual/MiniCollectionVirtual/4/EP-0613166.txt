<ABSTRACT>
The invention 
relates to a method of making a plasma display apparatus 

which comprises the steps of forming a plurality of first 
electrodes on one of a plurality of dielectric substrates to 

extend in one direction; forming a plurality of second 
electrodes on the other substrate to extend in another 

direction perpendicular to said one direction; forming a 
ridge on at least one of said substrates to define a 

plurality of pixel areas; and providing a fluorescent 
material in said pixel areas, the improvement in which a 

relief corresponding to said ridge is fabricated by the 
steps of:

 
   providing a plurality of dielectric layers on the 

substrates so that at least one surface of an unpatterned 
first dielectric layer of a dielectric composition 

comprising an organic polymer comes in contact with a 
patterned second dielectric layer of a dielectric 

composition comprising an organic polymer, a solvent and a 
dispersibility changing agent, thereby forming an assembly;

 
   partially drying the assembly under a certain 

heating condition to diffuse a desired pattern from the 
surface of the second dielectric layer containing the 

dispersibility changing agent into the interior of the first 
dielectric layer; and

 
   developing the assembly to remove the second 

dielectric layer and the area of the first dielectric layer 
patterned by diffusion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of making a
plasma display apparatus comprising a plurality of stripe-shaped
electrodes arranged in a matrix, a dot-shaped
discharge area or pixel area at each solid intersection
between said stripe-shaped electrodes and a fluorescent film
formed on each of said discharge areas and adapted to emit
light when said fluorescent film is excited by ultraviolet
rays from the corresponding discharge area.The plasma display apparatus typically comprises a
pair of forward and backward insulation substrates arranged
opposed to each other to form a discharge space
therebetween, said discharge space containing a gaseous
mixture of He with a trace of Xenon and others, a group of
stripe-shaped electrodes on the opposed surfaces of said
insulation substrates, said stripe-shaped electrodes being
arranged to form a matrix pattern in said discharge space,
said matrix parting said discharge space into a plurality of
discharge gas containing sub-spaces, each intersection
between said stripe-shaped electrodes corresponding to a
pixel, and a fluorescent film in each of said sub-spaces. More particularly, as shown in Fig. 8, the forward
insulation substrate 1 is formed of sheet glass, with the
internal surface thereof including a film-type light-blocking
mask 2 formed thereon and first stripe-shaped
electrodes 3 arranged side by side on the internal surface
of the substrate 1 in one direction, these electrodes 3
functioning as anodes. The internal surface of the other or
backward substrate 4 is similarly formed of sheet glass and
the internal surface thereof includes second stripe-shaped
electrodes 7 arranged to extend in a direction perpendicular
to the lengths of the first electrodes 3, these electrodes 7
functioning as cathodes. The first and second electrodes 3,
7 are separated from each other by dielectric partitions 8.
A dot-like discharge area 9 is formed at each of the
intersections between the first and second electrodes 3, 7.
The discharge area 9 contains a discharge gas containing
Xenon. A dot-like fluorescent film 10 for color display is
formed on the surface of each of the second electrodes 3.Each of the partitions 8 is formed to have a
thickness ranged between 100 µm and 200 µm by
repeated thick-film printing of insulation paste. The
discharge gas is a two-component mixture gas containing He
and Xe, a three-component mixture gas containing He, Xe and
any other suitable component or a single gas (e.g. Xe). The
discharge gas is sealed within the corresponding discharge
area 9

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a plasma display apparatus which comprises
the steps of forming a plurality of first electrodes (3) on one

of a plurality of dielectric substrates (1, 2) to extend in one
direction; forming a plurality of second electrodes (4) on a

second substrate (2, 1) to extend in another direction
perpendicular to said one direction; forming a ridge (10) on at

least one of said substrates (1, 2) to define a plurality of
pixel areas; and providing a fluorescent material (5) in said

pixel areas,

characterized in that a relief corresponding to said ridge (10)
is fabricated by the steps of:


providing a plurality of dielectric layers (23, 25) on the
substrates (21) so that at least one surface of an

unpatterned first dielectric layer (23) of a dielectric

composition comprising an organic polymer comes in contact
with a patterned second dielectric layer (25) of a

dielectric composition comprising an organic polymer, a
solvent and a dispersibility changing agent, thereby

forming an assembly;
partially drying the assembly at a temperature of 40-60 °C
for 1-5 minutes to diffuse a desired pattern from the

surface of the second dielectric layer (25) containing the
dispersibility changing agent into the interior of the

first dielectric layer (23); and
developing the assembly to remove the second dielectric
layer (25) and the area of the first dielectric layer (23)

patterned by diffusion.
A method of Claim 1 wherein the assembly is formed by
providing the first dielectric unpatterned layer (23) on

the substrate (21) and thereon the second dielectric
patterned layer (25).
A method of Claim 1 wherein the assembly is formed by
providing the second dielectric patterned layer (25) on the

substrate (21) and thereon the first dielectric unpatterned
layer (23).
A method of Claim 1 wherein the formation of the assembly
and the partial drying of the assembly are repeated.
A method of Claim 1 wherein the dispersibility changing
agent is a material which functions as a dispersant for the

organic polymer contained in the first dielectric layer
(23) and has a higher boiling point than the solvent.
A method of Claim 1 wherein a negative-working patterning
is carried out by employing a solubilizer as the dispersibility

changing agent.
