<ABSTRACT>
A cutting device comprises an annular cutting member (6) provided with a flat drive face (8) on one side of a diametral plane, by which the cutting member (6) is attached to an ultrasonic horn (10) providing a source of ultrasonic vibrations. The face (8) is arranged to constitute an anti-node of the device (a portion of maximum displacement), and the centre of the aperture 12 of the member (6) provides a theoretical node (portion of no displacement). The relative values of R1, the radius of the hole of the cutting member (6), and R2, the outer diameter thereof, are selected, in dependency on the physical characteristics of the cutting member itself, such that the member (6) vibrates radially inwardly and outwardly, in a pulsating manner. The member (6) is provided with a circumferential cutting edge (14) subtending an angle of about 180 DEG  on the opposite side of the drive face (8) by which a cutting action may be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with improvements relating to cutting 
devices, particularly cutting devices which are operative at high (ultrasonic) 
frequency. There is disclosed in DE-A-2504019 a cutting member which is secured 
at an axial plane to a source of ultrasonic vibrations, the cutting member 
comprising a cutting element which extends radially from the cutting member. According to this invention there is provided a cutting device 
comprising: 
[a] a generally annular cutting member having on one side of a diametral 
plane a driving face to be attached to a source of ultrasonic vibrations, 
said vibrations acting in a direction radially of the member; and [b] a cutting edge extending circumferentially of the cutting member on the other side of said 
diametral plane. Preferably the cutting member, whilst being generally annular, is 
provided in its outer surface with "flats", or surfaces curved on different centres. By attachment of a circumferential portion of the cutting member to 
(e.g.) an ultrasonic horn at an anti- node, the centre of the annulus constitutes a 
theoretical anti-node, and vibration will occur alternately radially outwardly and 
inwardly from the centre of the annulus, so that the cutting member effects a 
"pulsation". Thus, the cutting edge may subtend at an angle of between 45° and 
270°, although in practise a cutting edge above 180° is unlikely to be of wide 
value, and preferably the range of the cutting edge is between 60° and 160°, with 
a cutting edge vibrating radially of the annular cutting member. The cutting edge may be V-shape in cross-section, or two parallel 
cutting edges may be provided by machining a V-shape or U-shape groove into 
circumference of the cutting member at least over the circumferential distance 
thereof required to perform a cutting operation.  
 Such a cutting device may be used for cutting brittle and hard 
materials, such a ceramics or concrete, or soft materials, such as fabric, or 
foodstuffs. A theoretical analysis of radial vibrations in thin annular discs can be 
found in Young, Winsper and Sansomes papers in Applied Acoustics vol 3 1990  
 
P212-216. The wave equation for pure radial simple harmonic motion can be 
written as: 
 
Ur is the particle displacement in a radial direction at radius r and k is the wave 
number. 
K = WCr and Cr = Eρ(1 - V2)Where 
W is angular velocity Cr is wave velocity in a radial direction Equation (1) is a well known Bessel equation and a discrete solution is 
obtained for radial motion (after Watson 1962
