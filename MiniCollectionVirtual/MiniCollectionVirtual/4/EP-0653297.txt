<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a seamless polyimide composite
tube which comprises a polyimide layer, a conductive primer layer
on the surface of the polyimide layer and a fluororesin layer on
the surface of the primer layer. The invention also relates to a
method of manufacturing the polyimide composite tube.Heat-resistant resins, which have excellent mechanical
and chemical properties, have been molded into many different
shapes such as films, tubes, rods, formed materials, coating
materials, etc., and used as flexible printed substrates, heat-resistant
electric wire insulating materials, magnetic tapes, and
the like. Future additional uses of the heat-resistant resins
are also likely to become apparent. The heat resistant resins
are used typically as revolving and delivering belts or conveyor
belts for light electrical sounders, or heat fixing belts for
copiers, laser beam printers, and the like.As a heat-fixing member of a fixing apparatus in order to
fix toner developed on copying paper or decalcomania paper, a
heat roller is generally used in copiers or laser beam printers
that utilize electrophotographic technology. More specifically,
the papers developed with toner are passed through an opening
between a fixing roller having a heating mechanism (heat roller)
and a pressure roller, one page following another, thereby 
heating, melting and then fixing the toner on the paper.There has been research on the use of a polyimide tube,
instead of the heat roller, for a fixing apparatus. The inside
polyimide tube is equipped with a live roller, a tension roller
and a heater. Copying paper developed with toner is supplied one
after another to an opening between the polyimide tube and a
backing-up roller, thus fixing toner on the paper. This fixing
apparatus heats and fixes the toner at the surface of the
polyimide tube via the heater. Therefore, different from the
heat roller, this polyimide tube does not require time for
heating itself, and can start fixing toner on paper as soon as
the power supply switch of the fixing apparatus is turned on. In
addition, the capacity of the heater used for this fixing
apparatus is small, and the apparatus consumes little
electricity.When this fixing apparatus is used, the toner developed
on copying paper is instantaneously melted and fixed on the paper
by the heater employed inside the polyimide tube. Therefore, if
the polyimide tube wall thickness is uneven, the toner cannot be
melted evenly. As a result, an undesirable offset phenomenon
occurs. In this sense, it is
