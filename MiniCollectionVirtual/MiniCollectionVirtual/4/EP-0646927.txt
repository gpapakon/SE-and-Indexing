<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a digital memory and more particularly 
to memories accessible by more than one port. Digital memory is commonly used in computer data processing systems 
to store data and programs. Digital memory is also used for storing data in 
many special purpose digital applications. Access to a digital memory is 
through ports on the memory. The arrangement and the design of the memory 
ports determines how the memory can be used. A conventional single port static random access memory (RAM) can only 
be read from or written to during a memory cycle. What is meant by a memory 
cycle in the context of the memory application herein, is the minimum time 
required to complete a transaction, such as read or write, before another 
transaction can occur. For a conventional single port static RAM all access is 
through the single port, so only a read or write of the memory can occur on a 
memory cycle. A disadvantage of this type of static RAM cell is that a 
precharge is required on the read port prior to reading the cell. Accordingly, the 
read access time is slowed significantly. Conventional static RAMs do exist that have a read port and a separate 
write port. In these static RAMs it is possible to write to the static RAM on the 
write port while reading from the static RAM on the read port; however, it is not 
possible to perform two writes or two reads in one cycle. These types of static 
RAM cells normally require 9 complementary metal-oxide semiconductor 
(CMOS) transistors and are more complex than single port static RAMs, which  
 
typically require 6 CMOS transistors. An advantage of this configuration is that 
the read port does not need to be precharged. Another type of conventional static RAM is a dual port static RAM, which 
has two read/write ports. A typical dual port static RAM can have 8 transistors. 
On each of the two ports the static RAM memory cell can be read or written on 
each memory cycle. The possible port1/port2 operation combinations on each 
memory cycle for a static memory cell are: read/read, read/write, and 
write/read. A write/write combination on both ports into one static memory cell 
on the same cycle will cause problems, especially if values of the opposite 
polarity are written, because the cell can only store one state (high or low) at 
a time. However, typically a memory is implemented with many cells and it is 
possible to write via the two ports simultaneously to two different static memory 
cells. A disadvantage of this type of static RAM
