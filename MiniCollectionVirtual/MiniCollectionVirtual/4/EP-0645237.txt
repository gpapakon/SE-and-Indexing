<ABSTRACT>
A creasing unit (10) is disclosed for creasing a pre-cut blank (28) for a 
hinge lid pack cigarette box. The creasing unit comprises a four-sided 

turret (12) carrying first, second, third and fourth crease-forming dies 
(18A, 18B, 18C, 18D). Lifting plates (20) are provided on each side of 

the turret for feeding blanks onto the crease-forming dies. A suction 
inlet (32) holds the blank in position on each crease forming die. A 

press (22) carries a complemental crease-forming die (24) for 
sandwiching the blank between the respective dies so as to sequentially 

form creased blanks (28A, 28B, 28C, 28D). The invention extends to a 
method of forming a crease in a precut blank.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS invention relates to a creasing unit, and in particular to a creasing
unit for creasing blanks to be formed into cigarette boxes or the like.The manufacture of cigarette boxes entails a relatively lengthy and
involved production process. Cardboard sheets from which the blanks
are to be formed are first printed and embossed. In more up-market
packs, gold plate may then be applied to the appropriate areas on the
printed sheets. A so-called "debossing" stage then takes place for
cigarette boxes having rounded edges. In order to achieve a uniform
curve between the sides of the box to be formed, the "debossing" stage
involves multiple creasing in which a number of parallel creases are
formed alongside one another so as to provide a rounded corner when
folding takes place. The blank sheets are then cut into individual blanks
and folding creases are formed in the appropriate position so as to
facilitate folding of the blanks into hinge lid packs.In view of the number of different operations performed separately on
the blank sheets, there is a potential for misalignment of the sheets.
The separate printing, embossing and "debossing" stages are normally
performed at a separate location prior to cutting of the blanks to size.
If a slight misalignment has occurred during these stages, then there is
a chance that an entire batch of blanks has to be rejected.Stacking of the pre-printed and pre-creased sheets for transportation to
the cutting and folding stations may have the effect of flattening out the
creases. Furthermore, as the prepared sheets are not flat due to the various bosses and creases,
they are more difficult to stack and to transport.US-A-4,674,998 to Benedicenti discloses a forming assembly for forming boxes from
semi-finished flat blanks. The machine includes a carriage moveable between blank-receiving,
box forming and box ejecting positions, and includes feed means for feeding
a blank onto the carriage, and retention means in the form of suction members for
holding the blank in position on the carriage The blanks are pre-creased, with the
forming station solely forming a box-forming function, and not being used in any
creasing role.US-A-3,768,950 to Ihde discloses an apparatus for scoring synthetic plastic sheet
material. The apparatus comprises a female die member having a slot corresponding to
a desired score line, and a male scoring member including a scoring rule moveable
against the sheet material to stretch it into the slot. A resilient material frictionally
engages the plastic sheet to
