<ABSTRACT>
The starting point is a method for the hierarchical motion estimation in a television signal, in which the video frame is subdivided into fixed-size blocks and for each block, the motion relative to a second video frame is determined. Such motion estimation is used, in particular, for interframe-coded transmission for saving bandwidth, transmission time or storage capacity. It is the object to reduce the circuit complexity required for the motion estimation. According to the invention, blocks which do not overlap each other are created in the lower hierarchy level with finer resolution, and the centroids of these blocks are used as calculation points on a higher level of the hierarchy. Preferably, points which are located between the lines and do not represent real pixels in the line raster are investigated in the blocks which do not overlap one another. Especially for motion estimation in a television signal for transmission or recording with data reduction.

<CLAIMS>
Method for hierarchical motion estimation in a
television signal, in which the video image is subdivided

into blocks of fixed size, and the motion relative to a
second video image is determined for each block, characterized

in that areas which do not overlap one another
are created in the lower, more finely resolving hierarchy

stage, and the centroids of these areas are used as
calculating points in a higher hierarchy stage.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that in the areas which do not overlap one another points

are investigated which are situated between the lines and
are not true pixels in the line-scanning pattern.
