<ABSTRACT>
A saw blade with a body (1) has unstaggered teeth with cutting edges which are provided in repetitive cycles and each cycle has at least one tooth group consisting of at least two teeth (2), these teeth (2) being formed symmetrically to a longitudinal centre plane (8) through the body. In the cycle, at least two groups of teeth (2, 2
<
*
>
) are nested preferably regularly, of which the first group consisting of at least two teeth (2) has a height decreasing from tooth to tooth and as a result an increasing width, while the teeth (2
<
*
>
) of the second group are of identical design and constitute the teeth with the largest width.

A saw blade having a basic body (1) and unset teeth with 
cutting edges which are provided in recurring cycles, and each 

cycle having at least one group of teeth with at least two teeth 
(2) with a decreasing height and increasing width graduation, 

the teeth (2) being formed symmetrical with regard to a longitudinal 
centre plane (8) through the basic body, 
wherein
 at least 
two groups of teeth (2,2*) are, preferably regularly, intermixed 

in a cycle, with the teeth (2*) of the second group are formed 
identically and have the greatest width and the smallest height. 
A saw blade as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein
 the saw blade has 
only unset teeth (2, 2*) and the effective cutting edges resp. 

cutting edge sections (6
1
, 12
1
; 6*, 12*, 14
2
, 12
2
; 6*, 12*, 14
3
, 
12
3
; 6*, 12*) of all teeth (2, 2*) are formed by an inflected 
cutting edge (5
1
, 5*, 5
2
, 5*, etc.). 
A saw blade as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
wherein
 the widest 
tooth (2*), by whose recurrence the second group of teeth is 

formed, has an angle between phase (7*) and flank (10*) of more 
than 90째. 
A saw blade as claimed in one or more claims 1 to 3, 
wherein
 
there is at least one tooth (2*) of the second group included 

between two teeth (2
1
, 2
2
, etc.) of the first group.  
 
A saw blade as claimed in one or more claims 1 to 4, 
wherein
 
the phases (7, 7*) on all teeth (2, 2*) of both groups have a 

common phase angle (9) with respect to a straight line perpendicular 
to the longitudinal centre plane (8) of the basic body 

(1). 
A saw blade as claimed in claim 3, 
wherein
 the second group 
of widest teeth (2*), which work on the cutting channel only, are 

rounded off between phase (7*) and flank (10*). 
A saw blade as claimed in one or more claims 1 to 6, 
wherein
 
at least the teeth (2*) of the second group are wider than the 

basic body (1). 
A saw blade as claimed in one or more claims 1 to 7, 
wherein
 
the flanks (10*) of the teeth (2*) of the second group are 

provided at a flank angle (11*) between 3째 and 12째, particularly 
8째. 
A saw blade as claimed in one or more claims 1 to 8, 
wherein
 
the teeth (2, 2*) of both groups are provided as hard metal, 

ground teeth. 
A saw blade as claimed in one or more claims 1 to 9, 
wherein
 
further groups are formed in the recurring cycle of teeth (2, 2*) 

from both groups, which have recurring, variable pitches (t
1
, t
2
, 
t
3
, t
4
, etc.). 
A saw blade as claimed in claim 10, 
wherein
 the number of 
teeth in the further group, given by the order of variable 

pitches (t
1
, t
2
, t
3
, etc.), is not equal to the number of teeth 
in the first two groups of teeth.
