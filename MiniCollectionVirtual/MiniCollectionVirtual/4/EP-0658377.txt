<ABSTRACT>
- Method for grinding solid raw materials, such as ores, in which the material processed is subjected to the compressive action of a moving member able to compress this material against a bearing surface and in which two parallel compression rolls (1 and 2) of a known type are employed, rotating in opposite directions to each other, and between which the material is driven, one roll (1) being mounted on a fixed axle, the other roll (2) being mounted on a moving axle (5), remaining parallel to the first one, and this moving axle is subjected to the thrust of at least one pressing member (8, 8') and the method is further characterised in that the thrust developed by this pressing member is controlled so as to cause the pressure exerted by the moving roll on the material bearing against the roll of fixed axle to vary continuously.

Method for grinding solid raw materials, such as ores, in which said
materials are subjected to the action of compression of two parallel compression

cylinders (10, 20) rotating in opposite direction to one another, and between
which the materials are entrained, the said two cylinders being mounted on

spindles (15, 25) parallel to one another, one of the spindles being mounted
mobile, at least one of the spindles being capable of being subjected to the thrust

of at least one pressure member (28, 28'), characterized in that the two cylinders
are mounted on mobile spindles, in that said spindles (15, 25) are subjected to the

thrust of at least one pressure member, and in that the thrust developed in said
pressure member is controlled (30) so as to vary in time the pressure of the two

mobile cylinders.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the said two cylinders
(10, 20) are each subjected to a thrust varying in time, in accordance with

different laws.
Method according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the said
two cylinders are subjected to thrusts varying cyclically in time.
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in that the said two cylinders
are subjected to a thrust varying sinusoidally in time.
Method according to one of Claims 2 to 4, characterized in that the
variation in time of the thrust is such that it opposes the vibrations to which said

cylinders are subjected during compression of the materials.
Method according to Claim 5, characterized in that the vibrations are
measured and a pulsation of compression is created for each cylinder of

frequency and of phase such that it opposes and/or absorbs said vibrations.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the
presence is detected, within the materials, of foreign bodies capable of being 

ground or compressed and, in the event of detection of one or more foreign
bodies, at least one of the two cylinders is subjected to a substantially zero thrust.
Method according to Claim 7, characterized in that the two cylinders are
subjected to a zero thrust, with a view to allowing the two cylinders to move in

opposite direction and therefore to allow free passage for said foreign bodies.
Device for grinding solid raw materials, such as ores, comprising two
parallel compression cylinders (10, 20) rotating in opposite direction to one

another, and between which the materials are entrained, characterized in that the
two cylinders are mounted on mobile spindles (15, 25) and in that it comprises

thrust means (18, 28) adapted to subject the said two cylinders to a thrust varying
in time.
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in that the thrust means are
adapted to generate a thrust cyclically variable in time.
Device according to one of Claims 9 or 10, characterized in that the thrust
varies sinusoidally with time.
Device according to one of Claims 9 to 11, characterized in that the thrust
means are adapted to generate a variable thrust such that the latter counterbalances

the vibrations to which the said two cylinders are subjected.
