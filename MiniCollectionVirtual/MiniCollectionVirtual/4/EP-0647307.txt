<ABSTRACT>
A heat pipe heat exchanger is provided in the form of a serpentine heat pipe (38) that does not have the ends of the individual tubes manifolded to one another via a straight pipe or via any other common connector. Instead, it has been discovered that heat pipes connected via U-bends (31) to form a continuous coil function adequately. The serpentine heat pipe may include integral condenser and evaporator portions separated by a divider to form a one-slab heat exchanger, or separate evaporator and condenser coils connected to one another by vapor and return lines to form a two-section heat pipe. A method of producing a serpentine heat pipe indludes providing a plurality of U-shaped tubes (30) which are interconnected to form a single serpentine heat pipe (38), one of the tubes having an open end, and inserting sufficient refrigerant (34) in the one tube to allow each of the tubes to function as a separate heat pipe. The serpentine heat pipe heat exchanger may be used to increase the dehumidification capacity of an air conditioner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to passive heat
transfer devices and more particularly relates to heat
pipes utilizing the high latent heat of evaporation and
condensation, together with the phenomenon of capillary
pumping of a wick, to transfer very high heat fluxes
without the addition of external energy.So-called heat pipes are well known, and typically
comprise a condenser and an evaporator connected to one
another as a closed system. Referring to Figure 1, the
typical heat pipe 6 comprises an enclosed tube 8 having
one end forming an evaporator portion 10 and having
another, somewhat-cooler and lower-pressure end forming
a condenser portion 12. A wick 14 extends through the
heat pipe from the evaporator portion 10 to the condenser
portion 12. The surrounding environment is cooled by the
evaporator portion and reheated by the condenser portion
with the help of fins 15.In use, liquid refrigerant 11 present in the
evaporator portion 10 is heated by the environment,
vaporized, and rises into the condenser portion 12. In
the condenser portion 12, the refrigerant is cooled by
the environment, is condensed with the release of latent
heat, and is then pumped back to the evaporator portion
10 by the action of the capillary structure of the
material forming the wick 14. The cycle then repeats
itself, resulting in a continuous cycle in which heat is
absorbed from the environment by the evaporator and
released by the condenser.As illustrated in Figure 2, it is also known to
increase the capacity of heat pipes by incorporating
several individual heat pipes 20 in a single assembly 21.
Each individual heat pipe is constructed and operable as
the heat pipe illustrated in Figure 1. While such an
assembly has a significantly higher capacity than a
single heat pipe, it is difficult and expensive to 
fabricate since each pipe must be individually charged
with the proper amount of refrigerant.Referring now to Figures 3A and 4A, it has been
proposed to reduce the fabrication and installation costs
of heat pipes by utilizing U-shaped heat pipes connected
to form serpentine heat pipes. Fabrication costs are
decreased through the use of the U-shaped tubes.
However, it was thought that the individual tubes of such
heat pipes could not be charged with refrigerant and that
the serpentine coils would inhibit fluid movement through
the heat pipes, thus decreasing their efficiency. One
way that such serpentine heat exchangers are rendered
useful as heat pipes is to vertically orient a heat
exchanger such that the tops of
