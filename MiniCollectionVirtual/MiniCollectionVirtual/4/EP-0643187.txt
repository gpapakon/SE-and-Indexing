<CLAIMS>
A window winder carriage (3) for a motor vehicle, 
capable of sliding along a fixed vertical rail (4) 

under the action of driving means, and comprising on 
the one hand, for its assembly with a window (2), at 

least one vertical resilient clip (10) with a hooking 
lug (12) and on the other hand an upper stop face (8) 

for the lower edge (14) of the window (2) in the 
assembly position, from which face (8) there project 

upwards a rigid portion (6a) for guiding the rail, and 
the resilient clip (10) so as to overlap with the 

bottom of the window (2) in the assembly position where 
the lug (12) of the clip hooks into a hole (13) made in 

the window near its lower edge (14),
 
characterised in that the lug (12) comprises at its 

free end a lower flange (16) for holding it 
transversely on the window (2). 
A carriage according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the dimensions and positions of 

the lug (12) relative to those of the hole (13) in the 
window are such that vertical play (j1) between the 

edge (14) of the window and the upper face (8) of the 
carriage is greater than or equal to the height (h) of 

the flange (16) of the lug and less than or equal to 
the vertical play (j2) between the latter and the upper 

edge of the hole (13). 
A carriage according to one of Claims 1 and 2,
 
characterised in that resilient tongues for taking up 

play (17,22) are arranged in line with the upper stop 
face (8) and/or in line with a lateral guiding face 

(20) suitable for cooperating with the rail (4).
