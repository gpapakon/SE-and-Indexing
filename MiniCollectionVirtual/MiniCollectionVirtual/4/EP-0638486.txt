<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cartridge and 
method for the preparation of whipped beverages and, 
in particular, to sealed cartridges which are formed 
from substantially air- and water-impermeable 
materials and which contain one or more ingredients 
for the preparation of beverages and to a method of 
preparing whipped beverages from such cartridges. It has previously been proposed to seal beverage 
preparation ingredients in individual air-impermeable 
packages. For example, cartridges or capsules 
containing compacted ground coffee are known for use 
in certain coffee making machines which are generally 
termed "espresso" machines. In the production of 
coffee using these coffee machines the coffee 
cartridge is placed in a brewing chamber and hot 
water is generally caused to pass under pressure 
through the cartridge, thereby extracting the 
aromatic coffee constituents from the ground coffee 
and producing a coffee beverage. Typically in the 
production of "espresso" coffee a brewing time of 
about 25 seconds is used at a pressure of about 6 x 
105 Pa. Cartridges containing roast and ground coffee in 
which hot water flows under gravimetric force through 
the cartridge are also known. A cartridge of this 
general type is described in British Patent No. 
1397116. In our EP-A-0272922 there is described a package 
which contains at least one beverage preparation 
ingredient, e.g. roast and ground coffee. In a 
preferred embodiment the package is formed from a 
substantially air- and water-impermeable material and 
comprises a sealed body portion having a compartment  
 
containing the beverage ingredient and an outlet 
channel, the compartment and the outlet channel 
co-operating in such a manner that, in use, the 
beverage is filtered, thereby avoiding the necessity 
for an external filter. There is also described in EP-A-0272922 a method 
for preparing a beverage which comprises positioning 
the beverage containing package at a brewing station, 
introducing water through water introduction means 
into the package, allowing the water to commingle 
with the beverage ingredient, and collecting the 
beverage so-formed through an outlet formed in the 
package. The beverage packages as described in 
EP-A-0272922 are primarily intended to be used with a 
beverage preparation machine which handles the 
packages automatically or semi-automatically. A 
machine of this type is described in our 
EP-A-0334572. The packages may contain roast and 
ground coffee, leaf tea or one or more powdered 
beverage

<CLAIMS>
A cartridge (1) containing one or more beverage 
ingredients (8) and being formed from substantially 

air- and water-impermeable materials, the said 
cartridge (1) comprising an inlet (4) for the 

introduction of an aqueous medium into the cartridge, 
a compartment containing the beverage ingredient or 

ingredients, an outlet (5) for the beverage produced 
from the beverage ingredients characterised in that 

the cartridge includes whipping means (18) provided in 
the path of the beverage prior to the outlet (5), to 

whip the said beverage. 
A cartridge as claimed in claim 1 wherein the 
whipping means (18) comprises an impeller (23,24) 

adapted to engage an external driving device (40, 41, 
60). 
A cartridge as claimed in claim 2 wherein the 
impeller comprises a rotor (18) with a plurality of 

radial vanes(22). 
A cartridge as claimed in claim 3 wherein the 
rotor (18) has a hollow drive shaft adapted for 

engagement with the external driving device (40, 41, 
60). 
A cartridge as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims wherein the whipping means is 

positioned in a chamber (17) integrally formed within 
the cartridge (1). 
A cartridge as claimed in claim 5 wherein the 
chamber (17) has a plurality of fixed vanes (20) 

provided therein. 
A cartridge as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims wherein the inlet (4) and/or outlet 

(5) is covered by a substantially air- and water-impermeable 
material prior to the formation, in use ,  

 
of the inlet (4) and/or outlet (5) in the cartridge 

(1). 
A cartridge as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims wherein a channel (6) communicates 

with the inlet (4) for the entry of an aqueous medium 
into the cartridge, the channel (6) being separated 

from the compartment containing the beverage 
ingredient or ingredients (8) by a wall which has a 

plurality of openings (7) formed therein for the entry 
of the aqueous medium into the compartment containing 

the beverage preparation ingredient(s) (8). 
A cartridge as claimed in claim 8 wherein the 
channel (6) extends along at least one side of the 

compartment containing the beverage preparation 
ingredient(s)(8). 
A cartridge as claimed in claim 8 or claim 9 
wherein the channel (6) extends around three sides of 

the compartment containing the beverage preparation 
ingredient(s)(8). 
A cartridge as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 
10 wherein the openings (7) comprise a plurality of 

elongate slots. 
A cartridge as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims wherein a filter (10) is disposed 

between the compartment and at least a part of the 
under surface of the top of the cartridge (1), one or 

more passages (11) being formed between the filter 
(10) and the top of the cartridge (1), which 

passage(s) (11) communicate(s) with the outlet (5). 
A cartridge as claimed in claim 12 wherein 
the filter (10) is made from a water-impermeable

preceding claims which is provided with at least one 

recognition means (32,33,34) whereby, in use, the 
cartridge (1) is identified by the machine into which 

it is placed for treatment therefrom and the 
identification of the cartridge (1) thereby causes it 

to be subjected to the correct treatment steps 
including the introduction of a aqueous medium into 

the cartridge (1) and the engagement of the whipping 
means (18) by an external driving device (40,41,60) 

incorporated into the machine.
