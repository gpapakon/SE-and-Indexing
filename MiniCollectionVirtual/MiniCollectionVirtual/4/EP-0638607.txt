<ABSTRACT>
A thermal insulator of the present invention 
includes a foam containing solidified CO₂ gas. A 

method for producing the thermal insulator includes the 
steps of: mixing a metal compound selected from the 

group consisting of a metal oxide and a metal hydroxide, 
water, a polyol component, and an isocyanate 

component to generate a mixture; foaming the mixture in 
a container to generate closed-cells made of a water-foamed 

polyurethane; and allowing CO₂ gas generated 
during the foaming step to react with the selected 

metal compound to solidify the CO₂ gas, thereby depressurizing 
the closed-cells in the closed-celled foam.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal
insulator used for a refrigerator, a freezer, and the
like, and a method for producing the same.In the past, plastic foams such as a polyurethane
foam and a polystyrene foam has been mainly
utilized as thermal insulators for refrigerators and
freezers. Most of these foams are closed-celled foams.
Superior thermal insulators have been produced by
using, as a blowing agent for forming cells, chlorofluorocarbon
gas having satisfactory blowing properties
and low thermal conductivity.In particular, a polyurethane foam has been
widely used since it can be molded by foaming in place.
For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication
No. 2-205582 discloses the use of water-foamed polyurethane
as a thermal insulator. The water-foamed
polyurethane is obtained as follows: Isocyanate which
is a material for polyurethane is reacted with water to
form a urea bond and to foam by generating CO2 gas. In
addition, a thermal insulator made of polyurethane foam
has been used, which utilizes chlorofluorocarbons and
water as a blowing agent for the purpose of reducing
the amount of chlorofluorocarbons to be used. In this
case, for making the best use of excellent insulation
characteristic of chlorofluorocarbons, zeolite, which
adsorbs CO2 gas and water vapor in the closed-cells of
the polyurethane foam in a thermal equilibrium reaction, 
is sometimes mixed with the polyurethane foam
(e.g., Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication
No. 3-292113 and U.S. Patent No. 4882363).Furthermore, there is a vacuum insulating
panel as a thermal insulator having satisfactory insulation
characteristics. The vacuum insulating panel is
obtained by sealing a thermal insulating material in an
airtight container and depressurizing so as to decrease
thermal conductivity. Thus, the vacuum insulating
panel has extremely high insulation characteristics.
A number of such vacuum insulating panels using
the following materials and structures have been proposed.
Inorganic fine insulating powders of pearlite,
silica, or the like, or a polyurethane foam or a honeycomb
structure of open-celled foams are sealed under
vacuum as a core material in a container having a high
gas barrier property. As the materials for the container,
a metal and plastic laminated film and a plastic
multilayer film together with a gas adsorbent have been
used. For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication
Nos. 57-133870, 63-21475, and 2-772293 disclose a
vacuum insulating panel in which rigid phenol polyurethane
foam is sealed as a
